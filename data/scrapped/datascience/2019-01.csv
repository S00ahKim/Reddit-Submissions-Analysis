&amp;#x200B;

This year, I want to become a faster data scientist, so please help :)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say you are working on a project without being given data. Maybe it's a journalistic piece, or maybe you're just under a time crunch and can't devote a whole lot to this project. But you don't have a pipeline that delivers the data you need. 

&amp;#x200B;

For my personal projects I spend an ungodly amount of time searching online for these datasets. Sometimes I have had to file FOIA requests to get them. Then I spend more time finding a way to read it in (weird formats/languages) or devising an intelligent sampling strategy (massive CSV files). I often spend days or weeks before I do any data science.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed, for example, on FiveThirtyEight, they must face the same problem. Except they don't have weeks to complete an end-to-end piece and keep it relevant. Often the prompt or cause for a piece will be one day to the next so they didn't have time to prepare weeks in advance. I assume that for their primary products in elections and American sports they have supply chains to get the data they need quickly, and they know what it's going to look like so it's cleaned by the time they use it. But for some of their niche, but still timely stories, how did they get the data so fast? What are some of your secrets?  


There are plenty of examples in their review piece [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-45-best-and-weirdest-charts-we-made-in-2018/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-45-best-and-weirdest-charts-we-made-in-2018/). This piece has their most unusual graphs. Most of it is not core FiveThirtyEight data offerings so I assume they sourced the data specifically for each piece when the need came. Some of it is very niche (like Pogba's spacial distribution for passing the ball). What are some tricks you know for doing this really fast?",9,1

I am a web/software application developer of 8 years looking for a career change. The thing I enjoyed the most was digging through data and making it useful for the client. The problem is that I have no college degree, a dropout actually with horrible grades. The thing is, I now have a motivation for actually doing college.

A couple of opportunities have presented itself and I am not sure what to take and wanted to hear from the community on the pros and cons of these opportunities. I would love to work on a PHD, but a masters would be fine as well. The reason for a PHD is that I wouldn't mind living in the EU for a bit while working and a PHD would be more practical. Hell, even earning a PHD in the EU would be ideal.

\[Herzing College\]([https://www.herzing.edu/technology/data-analytics-degree](https://www.herzing.edu/technology/data-analytics-degree)) has a degree in Data Analytics and I was wondering if that would be enough to get into the industry and if it would be taken seriously by the community itself. They also have an MBA with a specialty of Data Analytics as well. The thing is, I can do this while working full time which is useful. However, I feel that if I do that, my grades may suffer a bit.

The other opportunity is that my local community college has a transfer program with UW Madison, guaranteed to get in after 2 years with a 3.0/3.5? gpa. Then I could get a BS in Stats then possible try for a PHD program. This will require me to go full time, with less money, but with a better name.

Another opportunity is Edgewood (A small private college in Madison) in which I have been accepted before. They have a BS in Mathematics. However, I am not sure how well that would be perceived if I apply for PHD programs. This will also require me to go full time as well.

Any guidance would be grateful. Also I am in my 30s living in the states if that makes any difference.",10,1

\-	Use a stepwise regression algorithm

I have a small archival dataset that has multiple data gathering techniques (e.g., manual transcription, web scraping), multiple sources, and annual updates of each source. From there, I have code to merge in identifiers (from a table researched by humans) to each source's data and then merge it all together on those ids and year.

I'd like tests to check the source data, the code, the ids, and the assembled dataset, so that I have confidence that important things don't change (e.g. when transcription errors are fixed) and newly added data meets expectations. One goal is that I'd like to be able to take updates from grad assistants, drop them in, and run tests to catch most problems.

Here's what I have so far:

1. Testing counts of rows each sub part and year and also testing the mean of a numeric column.
1. Testing that names in data have an id in the I'd table and vice versa.
1. Testing the code (straightforward). 
1. Testing that the assembled data meets expectations. This is WIP, but I'm thinking counts and checking for duplicates.

What else would you test for? I've considered having a random five percent of the data regathered and testing it against the full data. For future updates, I'd have the test sample gathered separately to write tests and then run the full incoming update data against those. Thoughts?

If this sounds a little over-engineered, you're not wrong. However, the plan is to add several other sources, and I want to get the protocol though out and tightened up while the overall size is still small.

I appreciate any feedback or pointers toward solutions for similar cases. I did a lot of searching, but I didn't find anything that's really on point. ",9,1

I'm working on some personal projects on my own and have some prior experience in coding, but I feel like this covers so many subjects that I would not know where to begin with on my own. Others have recommended online courses and I've had some luck with those in the past, but have found that my motivation/time to dedicate to these ebbs and flows based on other things that are happening in my life. 

A little about me:

* 24 y/o, employed full-time with a tech/data company. I get to use basic SQL and a little bit of PL/SQL in my day-to-day, so I'm fairly proficient at that, but I know I could get better. My company is also pushing AI very heavily recently, so any experience - even basic - I can get with that will be beneficial I believe. 

* I have some prior coding experience as I mentioned earlier. I took several CS classes as an undergrad and am moderately proficient in C++ and Python. However I was not a CS major nor did I finish the minor, so I'm just a guy with a passion for coding. 

My employer will likely reimburse the cost of this course up to $5000, so after a bit of googling it appears I will only pay around half-price. Is this worth it?",60,1

Currently I am in a situation where I am building multiple features, and deciding if they are helpful or not. I have created a base class that provides some simple methods:

* write\_features
* get\_features (get the cached, or recalculate if necessary)
* calculate\_features (`raise NotImplementedError`)
* pre\_process (specific to the dataset Im using)

This mostly does what I want, but I figured that there has to be a better solution out there (more polished, better thought out, etc).

Are these methods commonly used in any algorithms?  I'm not sure how I would implement it into R. 

&amp;#x200B;

Variable Gradient is the most confusing. It groups data from neighboring bins with a bin factor being determined. The level of smoothing is determined by the radius. All bins contribute to the calculation of the bin factor, with decreasing weight as the distance from the target bin increases. The weight is equal to radius\^2 / (distance\^2 + radius\^2)

&amp;#x200B;

Once you calculate the overall factor, a calculation is performed for each bin, weighted by an exposure, with various radii and a selected credibility level. The calculation that yields the largest distance from 1 is then selected as the factor to be used for that bin.

&amp;#x200B;

Over multiple iterations of the model, the factors are blended until the model converges and we receive a final coefficient for that bin.

Currently I am a sophomore civil engineering major, and I am coming to figure out that this field may not be for me. Thus, I am looking at switching into data science since it piques my interest. At my school, they offer a data science major in which I would be able to still graduate on time if I switch. I have seen it mentioned here that CS , Stats, or Math would be a better background to get into data science. The problem is, my school doesn't offer a Stats major, and doing CS or Math would end up keeping me an extra semester or two. I have talked to the mathematics department head at my school about this and he says there is virtually no difference between a Math and data science degree, but that the math degree would set you up better for graduate studies and research work if you chose to do so.

A little background about me. I wouldn't say that I am obsessed with analytics and statistics or whatnot, just that this field interests me. I am a huge sports fan, and love to think about how teams make decisions on trades and signings by using data and analytics to project players. Obviously, working in the sports world is a pipe dream due to how sought after those positions are, but I think that I would like to do something similar as a career. That is, instead of projecting players, I would be projecting sales or analyzing consumer data for a company. 

I also have concerns about whether or not I could hack the work in the field. As a civil engineering major, I have hardly dealt with programming of any kind. I did a project with C back in high school and I found it extremely frustrating due to how I had to tell the computer to do everything. I also mentioned this to the department head, and he told me that programs data scientists use are more statistical analysis such as R, SAS, or SQL, in which its more so querying data and analyzing it rather than writing if-else statements. I think this would be better suited for me.

I would appreciate if any of you could chime in on these concerns.",1,1

My school that I will be attending grad school at to pursue a masters in data science just sent an email today that they are offering a focus in data engineering. This involves taking 2 to 4 specialized classes in big data architecture, SQL/NoSQL, and other related classes. This will take away my electives that would focus on data visualization and statistics. 

My background and current role is a software engineer (specifically .NET environment but also lots of experience in python). I haven't decided if I want to pursue the analytics route or continue my engineering route in data science. I figured I would make this decision as I got closer to graduation. My predicament is this:

Should I pursue data engineering since that is what my previous experience is in?

Pros to data engineering:

1. I could pursue a mid level career instead of going back to an entry level data scientist/data analyst position. 
2. My undergrad in computer engineering would be more relevant.
3. Specialization tends to offer job security (however this can backfire too if the field becomes irrelevant) 

Cons:

1. I might pigeon hole myself and close myself out to other opportunities that are more analytics driven
2. I really enjoy and am interested in machine learning and this doesn't seem to be something data engineers are commonly involved in. 

Pros to data science:

1. More general degree will allow other opportunities. I feel like I would still be able to pursue data engineering if I wanted to after I graduate.

Cons to data science:

1. I might have to take a lower level position which would set me back a few years career wise.
2. Data science is a buzz word and I think that companies might want to look for more specialized individuals

I only make 63k a year (closer to 75k after benefits and tuition reimbursement) so I'm not too worried about taking an entry level data science position since I'll probably still make more money. 

I'm coming here to see if you guys can give me insight. Are there pros and cons I am overlooking? Any personal experiences that are similar and what was your outcome? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. ",0,1

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dataset consisting of 225 variables and about 20 observations. I wanted to see if I could predict a  set of response variables with these 225 predictor variables.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I used a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model  as it should be suited for problems where you have many more variabels than observations. The optimal number of PLS components was selected by calculating the mean error for each number of PLS components, using leave-one-out cross-validation. The results were quite poor (to my surprise). I even saw that in some cases the prediction error increased in a monotonous manner with increasing number of PLS components, which is something I haven't seen before. Could this be due to the large number of variables?

&amp;#x200B;

In a second attempt I started by using the lasso for feature selection, which yielded about 10-15 predictor variables for each response variable. Then, I used only these response variables to build the PLS models. The results improved DRASTICALLY. Errors decreased by about 70-80%, and plots showing mean error as a function of PLS components decreased somewhat monotonically as expected.  


My question: The results seem a little bit suspicious because of the large improvement, and errors are a few percentages lower than I would hav expected them. My worry is that by using a combination of the lasso and PLS, I've somehow created 'overfitted' models that give good results due to random variations in the data, instead of actual patterns. I did use cross-validation to select the number of PLS components so this shouldn't be a problem, I think?",2,1

Got hired for a data science position as my first real job out of undergrad. Feeling like 6 figures of dead weight here. Not really sure what to do about it.

I'm alright on the theoretical side of it. Still obviously behind the rest, but I've got a solid foundation in pure math, probability theory, and linear modeling. Currently making my way through Gelman's BDA3 and also some statistical learning. But there's really no studying or practicing my way out of this. Everyone else on the team is 9 or 10 years older than me and is just always many steps ahead of me. Before this year I had never worked with Spark, Scala, tensorflow, Restful APIs, Avro serialization, S3 clusters, mParticle, Amazon Kinesis. I've never worked on ETL pipelines, never worried about deploying a model in prod, had only ever heard of Nomad, and had only seen code review on HBO's Silicon Valley.

Getting quickly to a point where I can make meaningful contributions to actual projects feels pretty hopeless. I still need to take days figuring out the architecture of unfamiliar internal services when I'm assigned a project. On collaborative projects, the work parceled out to me feels like I'm being given something to do just for the sake of having me do something. I slowly churn through some code that a team member probably could have written in a quarter of the time, make a bunch of mistakes that need to be corrected in review, and end up possibly eating up more of the reviewer's time than they would have taken doing my job themselves. The best case scenario is really that I have a high level idea that isn't terrible prima facia but has been tried before and didn't work out or is currently in production.

I don't think the problem here is as simple so as to be solved by 'more school, more papers, more textbooks, more math.' I'm personally not sure if a solution exists at all. It feels a bit like the only way to get to a point where I'm even remotely comparable to my coworkers in productivity is to work for 5 more years and have seen all of the things they've seen. This post seems a bit pointless in retrospect, but I guess I have two main questions here:

1. Is there any way I'm not seeing to get to a point of meaningful productivity?
2. Is there a realistic probability of a performance related demotion/firing? I'm feeling pretty overpaid at the moment, but I suspect people don't hire 21 year old fresh out of undergrad data scientists without the expectation of a training period.",22,1

So imagine that you own a restaurant, and after introducing a new menu (e.g. blueberry muffin), you find out that by looking only at the sales of blueberry muffin versus the total cost of procuring and storing blueberry muffin, the menu item by itself creates a net profit loss.

&amp;#x200B;

However, without you actually knowing, what happened is that after you introduced the blueberry muffin item, the sales in coffee greatly increases (for this case scenario, we assume that blueberry muffin and coffee perfectly complements each other). Since the profit margin of coffee is really large, when you look from the overall picture (total revenue vs total cost), you find out that there is actually an increase in total profit.

-the # of companies submitted for that given job

-a few related jobs salaries

-# of companies submitted for the related job

Their reasoning: because Machine Learning engineers are so expensive, the trend in tech is that companies are creating automated APIs to encapsulate the field so less skilled professions can incorporate machine learning into their stacks. In the future, APIs like Tensorflow and NumPy will allow average programmers to accomplish 90% of what an expert can achieve. It isn't a long-term skill in Industry. Also, companies are extremely picky about data scientists and other high-demand experts due to their high salaries. Basic data analysts are much more broadly employable.


How true is this perspective?


This raises the following question:


Where is the field moving? If individuals do decide to self study and then get a Master's in Machine Learning (with a specialization like data science/statistics) over the next decade, to emphasize that they are not 'script kiddies' and to possibly get into management, how employable will they be and how fierce will competition be for expert roles?

What other fields in technology do you think will be in demand and start rapidly growing over the next 5-10 years? Is that even predictable?

As Machine Learning becomes more automated, how can I make sure that the time and money I spent on my degree stays relevant / doesn't depreciate? What other skills will I need to be highly successful?",11,1

I'm a sophomore in college, currently a CS major, that's debating switching my major to Stats &amp; Data Science. I asked this question in /r/cscareerquestions and got some answers, so I wanted to post here as well and see answers from the other side.

I think I am in a sophomore slump and kind of feel like a CS major may not be the best idea for me anymore. I chose CS because I was good at the intro class, but after taking some higher-level required CS classes, I'm not sure if I should be rethinking it. I somehow grinded my way through Data Structures &amp; Algorithms with a B, and this semester I'm taking Discrete Math and Systems Software, which I am expecting a B- and a C in, HOPEFULLY. I don't even know if I like programming anymore with the way these classes are kicking my ass.

I never really wanted a job like those at Google, Microsoft, etc. because they seem like software engineering full time. I am perfectly fine being a code monkey or doing some more bland stuff, as the plan is to work to live, not live to work.

I am taking a statistics class and am liking it so far, but I don't want to fall into the same trap of CS, where I like the intro class but not so much the rest of the major. I could be wrong, but it seems like a Statistics &amp; Data Science major would be more in line with what kind of job I'm looking for. The SDS major also requires a minor in something else, and since I've taken a bunch of CS classes already I almost already have a minor in CS. I would have to transfer colleges because my current school does not have this major, but that's ok because I was thinking of transferring anyway for different reasons. Is a stats major a good choice in today's job climate?

I have a Computer Science internship this summer at Raytheon, so maybe that'll shed some more light as to whether I should switch or not. However, I kind of need to make a decision soon, because I need to transfer for this major and I can't wait till the end of the internship for that.

So I'm fresh(graduated 2017) out of college as a math major and have been a year in my current data analyst job.

Eventually we will see a random string of 100 numbers, one of which will be the correct answer. 

Where in that thread will the correct answer appear? The 48th guess? The 3rd guess? The 100th guess? Will this produce a totally random spread of numbers, or will a pattern emerge?

Just assume I learn something like R. Before I invest time to learn R, I need to know if what Im trying to do is possible (not too difficult) to make and easy to use.

I want to build a model which forecasts sales of a particular product based on historical prices of:

1. the product itself
2. more importantly, the prices of about 20 other products for the same periods as prices of other products have a lot of impact on the sales of the product in question

What we will have is:

1. Historical sales of all products
2. Historical prices of all products
3. Future prices of all products

Obviously, we have to forecast the future sales of all products. 

Basically I would need the model to get the future prices of all products as an input and output the forecast for the product in question.

What do you guys think? Would it be doable in a reasonable amount of time for someone new to this?

If so, how?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/acw1oi/do_you_need_to_account_for_uncertainty_in_values/,rodiraskol,1546708875,"For my first stab at a data science project, I wanted to try and answer two questions:

1. *In college football, is there a correlation between AP poll ranking and probability of victory?*
2. *If yes, how can the correlation be quantified?*

&amp;#x200B;

**Background Info:**

In college football, a weekly poll of sportswriters takes place which aims to identify and rank the 25 best college football teams, with #1 being the best. Example here: [https://collegefootball.ap.org/poll](https://collegefootball.ap.org/poll)

Fans often complain that the ranking is inaccurate; for example, that certain teams are consistently overrated or underrated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Methodology:**

To start, I used [sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2018-schedule.html) to scrape all college football data since 1989 (the first year of the 25-team poll). I aggregated the data and ended up with this:

[https://imgur.com/a/o6Ro0ae](https://imgur.com/a/o6Ro0ae)

Where:

**AP rank differential** is the difference in AP poll ranking between the two teams in a game (#3 vs #7 would have a differential of ""4"").

And **Fraction not upsets** is the percentage of all games with that rank differential where the higher-ranked team won (the game was not an upset).

In my judgement, these two variables vary linearly.

&amp;#x200B;

To answer the 1st question, I stated a null hypothesis:

*There is no correlation between the poll difference and the probability of an upset*

To test it, I computed the correlation coefficient between the two (\~.81). Then, I took 10,000 permutation samples, permuting ""differential"" and leaving ""fraction"" alone, and calculated the correlation coefficient for each permutation.

Based on the fact that none of the permutation replicates had a value greater than 0.81 (p-value close to zero), I rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that there is a correlation between the differential and the probability of the higher-ranked team winning.

&amp;#x200B;

To answer the 2nd, I computed a best fit line. To get the uncertainty in the slope, I resampled with replacement the pairs of points 10000 times and computed the slope and intercept again.

[https://imgur.com/a/YxdX8VN](https://imgur.com/a/YxdX8VN)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I need help with:**

This graph shows how many games with each rank differential were in my dataset:

[https://imgur.com/a/tTlhK57](https://imgur.com/a/tTlhK57)

Predictably, games with a high rank differential have a much lower probability of occurring. Indeed, a game with a rank differential of 24 *never* occurred between 1989 and 2017.

Now, my intuition tells me that there is some kind of uncertainty I should be accounting for in the not-upset percentage that I calculated and that the higher-differential points, with fewer games played, have more uncertainty than the lower-differential points.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I calculate this uncertainty?

My first instinct was to make a Boolean series for each rank differential, where each **True** value is a single not-upset game and each **False** is an upset, and then resample them with replacement many times to compute confidence intervals for the percentage. But, since all 7 games with a 23 differential were not-upsets, that point had an interval of zero. And shouldn't that be my MOST-uncertain point? Since the fewest games were played?

&amp;#x200B;

Next, once I figure out the uncertainty, how do I factor it into my calculations of the correlation coefficient and equation of the best-fit line?

Here, I'm completely lost. The entirety of my statistics education consists of 3 courses on DataCamp.

Looking forward to learning something new!",4,1

1. IP
2. Cookies
3. Email address
4. MD5 hashed password
5. android\_id (if on android device)
6. referee\_id (the referrer will gain some perks after the referee reach a certain level)

I am looking at the [dedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe) library to see if I can train a fuzzy matching model to get the job done.

Or actually should I hard code a weighting algorithm, such that:

1. if IP equals, + 0.2
2. if Cookies equals, + 0.3
3. if both 1 &amp; 2, extra + 0.25
4. if email is similar (foobar1@domain.com, foorbar2@domain.com ...), +0.15
5. if hashed password equals, + 0.1
6. if referee\_id = referrer\_id, +0.1

MITx statistics and datascience course (a micromasters) has much more advanced maths, but is a very large time commitment (and very expensive if I want the qualification).

My reading around also makes me concerned that datacamp doesn't teach much more than syntax and dataquest is better for practice at solving problems. The flipside is that the new years sale for datacamp makes it a lot cheaper.

I went through all the stages up until the final interview (videocall, case study, on-site). I had several round of technical interviews with different team members and I honestly think I did great on the technical questions (tbh, it wasn't anything hard, explain overfitting, bias variance tradeoff, things like that), and I completely aced the coding interview (again, nothing hard at all, interviewer even said perfect). I kinda screw up the subjective type of questions, the one that requires you to have more experience or creativity (can PM them if anyone is interested, I would also be curious what any of you would answer to those), and I had some struggle during the presentation of a study case, granted I had to do the interviews in English which is not my native language. 

Now HR insisted on calling me to let me know about the rejection and give me a feedback. I'm getting complete opposite of what I was thinking. Apparently they liked the presentation and think I would have been a great fit to the team with potential, but that I lacked suffisant background on ML and stats (I don't know why she mention stats, I haven't even had any stats question asked to me). This is completely throwing me off since all 2 interviewers that conducted the ML theory interviews were giving positive encouragements (such as ""Exactly"", ""That's what I was looking for"", ""Perfect""). HR also mentioned lack of experience (but why advertise the job offer as an internship ? And why let me go through to the final interview ? and why say during interviews that they are not looking for someone with experience and that interns are here to practice ?)

Of course I'm a bit disappointed, although I have already secured another internship. What is troubling me right now is the fact that they thought I wasn't on point on simple basics technical ML stuff. The other internship is more research oriented and I'm afraid if I'm not able to explain easy concepts, I will completely tank the other internship.

1) data mining
2) eda and feature engineering
3) modeling (lasso, xgboost, etc)

However, I'm not sure how in depth I should go in terms of the modeling. Should I give a brief overview of the model, or simply provide rationale on what is being done.

246,2019-1-8,2019,1,8,12,adprzt,[META] Seeking input on subreddit rule (and style) changes,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/adprzt/meta_seeking_input_on_subreddit_rule_and_style/,Omega037,1546916431,"As we have mentioned previously, **the primary purpose of having a Data Science subreddit is to provide a place for DS professionals to discuss and debate topics relating to the field/industry.**

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, due to the high interest in data science from those currently outside the field, the subreddit is frequently inundated with submissions that do not fit the above purpose and are generally very repetitive.

&amp;#x200B;

Previous actions have been considered and taken by the mod team to rectify this issue.  Almost a year ago, we proposed a rule requiring submissions to either be made by a user with flair or be approved by a moderator.  Due to objections and suggestions from the community, we instead introduced a weekly sticky thread to capture these kinds of posts rather than have them appear in the subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this has not been as successful as hoped.  Thus, the mod team has discussed additional changes that we would like to implement.  Our new plan is twofold: 

1. Make significant changes to the submissions page, sidebar, and automoderator of the subreddit to help instruct new/unfamiliar users about the weekly sticky thread and rules in general.

2. Enforce the policy by enacting a short-term ""submission ban"" on users who make improper submissions.  Bans would not prevent users from posting in an existing submission (like the weekly sticky).

&amp;#x200B;

**We would like community input on these two ideas before we implement them.  Both in terms of whether to implelement them, and how to implement them.**

&amp;#x200B;

*In particular, if anyone has good CSS, subreddit style, and/or automoderator experience, we would be very interested in your input in particular for the first part.*",57,1

So, we trained the different models by repeated cross validation on a test set consisting of 3/4 of the total data, and the rest is the test set. Once we have tuned the hyperparameters using CV, we re-train the best model and compare different models using the test data. 

However, I was discussing with one colleague and it appears that our teacher had told us to use the test set only once, so we are confused about what is the correct methodology here. He (my colleague) has taken a data mining course and they used to compare different models using the test set and pick the one with e st accuracy, but now he (and I) are on the other side, thinking that we should evaluate and compare models using the mean accuracy from the CV.

I recently graduated college and have been working as a data analyst at a very large corporation for about 5 months. Although I love my employer, my role isn't particularly interesting so I've been thinking about what to study on the side to eventually advance into a data science role within the company in the future. 

I used R a lot in my undergrad classes as well as research in engeering that I did, but I am far from perfect in it. I've been seeing a lot that Python is a hot commodity and was wondering if I should continue with R or switch over to Python? 

I don't anticipate looking for a new job in the next few years so I definitely have some time to learn. I want to learn the nuances of the language I'm studying, brush up on my statistics, increase my knowledge on machine learning, and then look at big data analysis with Spark. Here are some paths I was thinking about:



#Python:

1. MIT Intro to CS edx course to learn the foundations

2. Python for Data Analysis book

3. Brush up on stats

4. Hands on Machine Learning book

5. Learn Spark book



#R:

All books

1. R for Data Science

2. Advanced R

3. Intro to Statistics and Data Analysis

4. Into to statistical Learning

5. Deep Learning with R

6. Big Data Analytics with R



I was also looking at Dataquest and was extremely intrigued by their curriculum. Can anyone vouch for them? 

Datacamp didn't seem as much my thing but I'd love to hear opinions on it as well. 

Also if anyone can share their learning path that would be great! Maybe some Coursera or edx courses?

I believe he also said if I were to have an on-site interview, they would just want to see if I would fit in or not. I don't recall him mentioning they would ask technical/coding question for the on-site interview. They have now decided they want to bring me on-site.

Since I only have a few days to prepare, I wanted to prepare for technical questions since I've never had an on-site interview for a data science or software engineer role that did not involve some technical questions. I wasn't sure if I should focus more on ML/data analysis or OOP/data structures/algorithms. Is it ok at this point to ask which kinds of technical questions I should prepare for?

I'm currently applying for junior data sciencist jobs here in germany and already had a few very positive job interviews (mostly on phone). One of the places invited me for a a ""getting-to-know"" day. It sounds like it's mostly for me to see the place ""in action"", see what kinds of projects the data science team is working on and stuff like that.

However, at the end of the day they want to give me a small dataset and want me to prepare a short presentation on that data witihin an hour. They said it's not about my coding skills and, in fact, it's fine, if I prep the figures in excel. They rather want to see how I look at the data, which questions I ask and how I interpret it. Sounds easy enough and if it was a neuroscience (I'm a Neuroscience PhD) topic, I wouldn't be worried at all. However, that company does mostly consulting and works with data from their clients websites. 

So, my background involves no business stuff, sales or whatever at all. I probably worry for no reason, but can anybody point me at a data set that is simple, but might involve interesting questions nevertheless? Just something to calm my nerves and give me a feel for what kind of stuff might await me. I'd be grateful for any additional tips as well!",4,1

(Still willing to accept any advice on this front, I refuse to accept defeat! )

&amp;#x200B;

Not wanting to give up on the project, I decided to research some other methods of building a Battleships AI and decided upon [Monte-Carlo Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). It's nothing new, it's been done before with Battleships, but it was still a very good learning process for me.

&amp;#x200B;

It wins in an average of about 45 moves, which seems to be near the best possible with a standard Battleships layout.

&amp;#x200B;

I've generated some heatmap gifs that show how the AI values each tile throughout the game. I thought they might be worth sharing because they are quite pretty and interesting!

&amp;#x200B;

Colour Key: 

* Dark Blue: Sea
* Red: Miss
* Pink: Destroyed
* Gray: Hit

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fj53575cya921.gif

Here is the first one, there is another in the GitHub page below, as well as the code required to generate more:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://github.com/DataSnaek/battleships\_ai](https://github.com/DataSnaek/battleships_ai)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the heatmap, you can very clearly see how it is 'thinking' or building a model of where it is likely that ships are. When it hits a target, the nearby squares light up and the rest of the board darkens, giving it a set of very likely squares that ships will be located, allowing it to replicate the strategy a human might employ of targeting squares adjacent to previous hits. Once it destroys the ship, the rest of the board lights up again and it starts efficiently working its way diagonally around the board looking for new targets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The data:**

&amp;#x200B;

I have a cohort of 5000 users and approximately 3000 products.

&amp;#x200B;

Each user has a current inventory of products (rough range of 0-100 items)

&amp;#x200B;

Each users has a transactional history of buying and selling items. (range of 0-1000 transactions - which can be for the same inventory item).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The goal:**

&amp;#x200B;

To be able to recommend a new product to buy based on the users current items in inventory as compared with similar users from the global cohort.

&amp;#x200B;

**More Info:**

&amp;#x200B;

I can create a ton of features surrounding each user and each product.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no explicit rating, just whether what each user did in their situation (held ABC products at time X, need purchase was for product Y).

&amp;#x200B;

I realise there are probably some non-ML approaches that will work here (and would be nice to know about them) but I specifically want to practice an ML approach for this.

&amp;#x200B;

Any general advice, resources, links, or general structure on how to set up such a problem would be much much appreciated! Thanks for your time.

The technical guys talk about some algorithms, the coder ones talk about the way in which they got the data, and I talk about strategy, segmentation and client lifecycle.

So I'm interested in any and all feedback regarding this draft resume. The ""Motivation"" section at the bottom is nontraditional, but the idea is to convey why I'd like to get a graduate degree outside of my current field. Let me know your thoughts on this. 

Please note, I am only interested in graduate programs that are online or that I can attend live stream. I've watched all of the admissions webinars for the programs I'm interested in, and they all said to highlight any online class experience that a student has. So I have done that and don't think I should take that off my resume.

As far as I can see from the requirements for a lot of top master's programs, I'm definitely lacking more on the math/statistics side. A lot of them specify having mathematics coursework as a pre-requisite, which I had very little of in undergrad (just Calc 1 and Intro Stats class). I don't have a problem trying to learn the content on my own (and have already started to), but do I even have a chance at these programs if they specifically say the word ""coursework"" and maybe even a min GPA for those courses? Would something like a Coursera certificate be an acceptable substitute? Curious to know what the admissions experience of other people with non-technical bachelors is like.

1. Get a masters from the states and apply for relevant jobs straight away thereafter. I'm in my senior year of BS in CS in my home country. So I will be having zero full time experience after I complete my masters which I'm guessing will make landing a job tough.

  


2. I have an offer from ZS Associates(Illinois based consulting firm) for a position of decision analyst in my country. I contacted 3-4 people in these positions and the work includes working with python, R, excel and all that for analysis and also some market research.

It's easy to look at, for example, the ""Has\_Lung\_Cancer"" and ""Is\_Smoker"" columns in a dataset, compute proportions, and take their ratios. However, when statements like this are made, do researchers take into consideration confounding effects of other variables in the dataset as well?

For example, maybe the statement above isn't *actually* correct, but could be amended as ""individuals who smoke *and* are over 210 pounds are three times as likely to develop lung cancer than those who don't"", for example.

I'm really excited about the new position and associated responsibilities, but feel like I am lacking mentorship and guidance on how to continue to develop my technical skills and improve (while there are people working in various IT roles at my company there is not a natural more experienced data scientist to learn from).  I want to be an all-star and am happy to put in the work to get there but I need some help figuring out where to put in that work.

This is ambiguous to me as a graduate student in high performance computing. Does this mean they're looking for candidates who have knowledge/experience in writing code that can be parallelized to run across distributed systems (e.g., clusters), or candidates who have experiencing running parallelized code across clusters, or something else?

&amp;#x200B;

As a computational physics graduate student, I focus on writing parallelized code (using MPI) that runs on supercomputers because the computations I do in my work are very computationally expensive.

And then each test has it's own test specific ways to measure ""importance"", for example: https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/feature_selection/anova_f-value_for_feature_selection/

The MAIN test that I've seen though is Random Forest. I've used Random Forest's to get feature importance graphs like this: https://imgur.com/a/FY3muq1.

However, I'm not really sure what is like the high-level or industry standard way to respond when someone asks something like ""how would you determine the features that strongly affect whether or not someone buys a product?"". In the past I've defaulted to discussing the RF feature importance projects I've done, but 

1) I'm not super confident regarding the math behind RF feature importance 
2) defaulting to RF seems super specific and might make it seem like I don't understand feature importance in general 
3) I don't know what to show as a final result other than just the feature importance graph. Like for example, I don't know how to get really quantitative and make a claim like ""Feature A is 2x more influential / important than Feature B"". ",17,1

But as I am going along, I frequently come across one issue with data. That issue is that a lot of data is not sampled at the same frequency as other amounts of data. For example, I may be trying to predict GDP using stock prices. But GDP is sampled by quarter, and stock price Is sampled by day. This will obviously create a problem with the data. 
Another issue that I come across is that often data has different time frames. For example, one dataset may be from 1940 to 2018, and another may be from 2000 to 2018. This will also cause some missing gaps in the data. 
So what I was wondering is, how should I deal with this issues?",15,1

I know econometrics well, mostly linear modeling, other stats and machine learning concepts are new to me. I don't feel that my math background is up to par.

I'm 31. I'd really rather not go back to school. Can I beef up my econometrics skills and learn the programming stuff on my own, or is that just not going to cut it to get a respectable DS position? If I can learn it all on my own, can you give me a rough timeline or a list of things I should know in order to feel comfortable going into an interview?

How is Algorithm is related to Big Data? Even though algorithm is a generic term, Big Data analytics made the term contemporary and more popular. (Bonus: Heres a pickup line on your date, You show me your algorithms and Ill show you mine. . Ok, Ok, Ill stop! No more cheesy jokes)

**Analytics:** Most likely, your credit card company sent you year-end statement with all your transactions for the entire year. What if you dug into it to see what % you spent on food, clothing, entertainment etc? You are doing analytics. You are drawing insights from your raw data which can help you make decisions regarding spending for the upcoming year. What if you did the same exercise on tweets or facebook posts made by your friends/network or your own your company. Now we are talking Big Data analytics. It is about making inferences and story-telling with large sets of data.There are 3 or 4 different types of analytics depending on who you talk to.

**Descriptive Analytics:** If you just told me that you spent 25% on food, 35% on clothing, 20% on entertainment and the rest on miscellaneous items last year using your credit card, that is descriptive analytics. Of course, you can go into lot more detail as well.

**Predictive Analytics:** If you analyzed your credit card history for the past 5 years and the split is somewhat consistent, you can safely forecast with high probability that next year will be similar to past years. The fine print here is that this is not about predicting the future rather forecasting with probabilities of what might happen. In Big data predictive analytics, data scientists may use advanced techniques like data mining, machine learning, and advanced statistical processes (well discuss all these terms later) to forecast weather, economy etc.

**Prescriptive Analytics:** Still using the credit card transactions example, you may want to find out which spending to target (i.e. food, entertainment, clothing etc.) to make a huge impact on your overall spending. Prescriptive analytics builds on predictive analytics by including actions (i.e. reduce food or clothing or entertainment) and analyzing the resulting outcomes to prescribe the best category to target to reduce your overall spend. You can extend this to big data and imagine how executives can make data-driven decisions by looking at the impacts of various actions in front of them.

**Batch processing:** Even though Batch data processing has been around since mainframe days, Batch processing gained additional significance with Big Data given the large datasets that it deals with. Batch data processing is an efficient way of processing high volumes of data where a group of transactions is collected over a period of time. Hadoop, which Ill describe later, is focused on batch data processing.

**Cassandra,** a beautiful name, is a popular open source database management system managed by The Apache Software Foundation. Apache can be credited with many big data technologies and Cassandra was designed to handle large volumes of data across distributed servers.  
**Cloud computing:** Well, cloud computing has become ubiquitous so it may not be needed here but I included just for completeness sake. Its essentially software and/or data hosted and running on remote servers and accessible from anywhere on the internet.

**Cluster computing:** Its a fancy term for computing using a cluster of pooled resources of multiple servers. Getting more technical, we might be talking about nodes, cluster management layer, load balancing, and parallel processing etc.  
**Dark Data:** This, in my opinion, is coined to scare the living daylights out of senior management. Basically, this refers to all the data that is gathered and processed by enterprises not used for any meaningful purposes and hence it is dark and may never be analyzed. It could be social network feeds, call center logs, meeting notes and what have you. There are many estimates that anywhere from 60-90% of all enterprise data may be dark data but who really knows.

**Data lake:** When I first heard of this, I really thought someone was pulling an April fools joke. But its a real term! Data lake is a large repository of enterprise-wide data in raw format. While we are here, lets talk about Data warehouse which is similar in concept that it is also a repository for enterprise-wide data but in a structured format after cleaning and integrating with other sources. Data warehouses are typically used for conventional data (but not exclusively). Supposedly data lake makes it easy to access enterprise-wide data you really need to know what you are looking for and how to process it and make intelligent use of it.

**Data mining:** Data mining is about finding meaningful patterns and deriving insights in large sets of data using sophisticated pattern recognition techniques. It is closely related the term Analytics that we discussed earlier in that you mine the data to get analytics. To derive meaningful patterns, data miners use statistics(yup, good old math), machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

**Data Scientist:** Talk about a career that is HOT! It is someone who can make sense of big data by extracting raw data (did u say from data lake?), massage it, and come up with insights. Some of the skills required for data scientists are what a superman/woman would have: analytics, statistics, computer science, creativity, story-telling and understand business context. No wonder they are so highly paid.

These must be provided in a ""machine readable"" format (and CMS thankfully specifically said ""no"" to PDFs).

The problem is that there is no standardization across hospitals, and it is challenging for those without medical training to comprehend the abbreviations in the chargemasters, let alone put together a set of charges for an admission. Additionally, these charges are often the base price for these interventions that hospitals take to insurance companies, for whom they will give discounts on the charges. Even if the patient doesn't have insurance, hospitals may (not always) give a discount to them anyhow. 

Still, it would be great if a tool existed for patients to search for a list of nearby hospitals and see what the costs for certain procedures are. I'm just wondering if anyone has heard of any sort of US national attempt to decipher or compare these chargemasters, or to organize them by diagnostic related grouping (DRG, which is basically a general idea of ""if you go to the hospital for [a], it will include [x, y, z, ...]).

In general all sources that talk about calibration only look at the full data, but in our business cases we always look at metrics of sub-groups like country, gender, age groups.

To be succinct heres what I have and I want to do:

What I have: 
a)	a series of audio interviews files; 
b)	these audio files respective transcripts in Word with i) manually identified timestamps for when subject X starts and stops speaking and ii) timestamps for when subject Y starts and stops speaking.

What I want to do: 
1)	repeated or integrated words by subject X and Y after one speaks the same words (to measure a sort of echo effect or mimicry);
2)	quantify the number and lengths of silences mid-speech by subject X and Y (trying to measure if theres a relationship between emotional content and the time it takes a subject to say his/her words). I imagine I would have to set the sensitivity to a particular decibel in order to ignore chair movements or sighing or other non-verbal sounds.

Any input will be tremendously valuable. Ive been dabbling in R for a while now and I am familiar with the tidyverse. What seems to pose the biggest challenge for me is to think of which tools to use in tadem with R to analyze audio content.

For the last three months, I worked hard to write a book that will make a difference. I firmly believe that I succeeded. I'm so sure about that because I received dozens of positive feedback. Both from readers who just start in artificial intelligence and from respected industry leaders.

I'm extremely proud that such best-selling AI book authors and talented scientists as Peter Norvig and Aurlien Gron endorsed my book and wrote the texts for its back cover and that Gareth James wrote the Foreword.

This book wouldn't be of such high quality without the help of volunteering readers who sent me hundreds of text improvement suggestions. The names of all volunteers can be found in the Acknowledgments section of the book.

It is and will always be a ""read first, buy later"" book. This means [you can read it entirely](http://themlbook.com/wiki/) before buying it.",26,1

I do not want to be to detailed on the particulars of the database however I do not think I need to be. The database I have we will say is a Credit Card example database. All information is fictitious. However, a LOT of the information is in character form, that is, data entries which are words and not numeric data. 

In data transformation it is easy to apply techniques to numeric data. Noisy or outliers? We can apply a Z-score to find them or use binning. Correlation? Again, we can z-score. Missing information? We can apply averages, medians, etc to fill in the missing data. Even certain word categories like Gender could be filled in using an ""unknown"" category. The problem for me comes with similarity matrix between all values. 

As I said I want to cluster the data and I would like to generate a similarity matrix so I can use various clustering algorithms such as K-means, Birch, and a quasi new method called Affinity Propagation. The problem is that if I were to convert attributes such as Gender, county, married, student, etc, into discrete numeric values, coming up with similarities is difficult because how does one define a similarity between male and female? Married or single? Student or employed or unemployed? Etc. It's the attributes that have these ""categories"", that are causing me problems. 

What are good techniques I could use to help transform the data so that I could get a better similarity matrix out of the database. I don't want to have my similarity matrix limited to only the attributes with actual discrete numeric data.

The authors try to address this problem by designing a new optimization algorithm that bridges the gap between the space of Adaptive Gradient algorithms and SGD with momentum. With this method a new tunable hyperparameter called partially adaptive parameter p is introduced that varies between [0, 0.5].

I'm working on a project that requires me to find a shortlist  of candidates out of a couple thousand possible solutions, now I have some descriptors and a very computationally intensive way of accurately scoring my solutions so I can only sample around 50-100 of the potential solutions, I already have a 10 potential solutions that have been scored but they have been hand picked and are somewhat similar. I have been reading about optimization algorithms in the context of the optimization of machine learning hyper parameters but those mostly seem like continues variables and you can chose the parameters independently. I was wondering if you guys had any opinions on what would be the best way to approach this. My first instinct would be to take a random sample and than combine the outcome with the already tested solutions and than basically do hill climbing using the descriptors to find similar solutions to the best candidate found so far.

So I have a few options... 

1. get a BA and get work experience and try for data science jobs once I get more experience and if all fail then try for masters

2. Or get a BS (would take an extra semester of stupid courses) and do the above.


Im just afraid that if I ever decide that work experience isnt helping and so I want to pursue data science through getting a masters that my BA va BS decision could be significant in getting into grad school

My understanding of RFE is, it starts by trying N - 1 models, and then removing the feature that causes the N - 1 models to perform worst. Then it tries N - 2 models, and so on. I've also read elsewhere that RFE does some sort of weighting. Which one is it? Weighting to me indicates a more math-y approach that requires more interpretation of the ""optimal"" features, whereas doing the N - 1, N - 2 indicates to me more of a brute force approach that requires less interpretation of the ""optimal"" features.

My model specifically said the highest accuracy was with 18 features. However, the suspect aspect was how the accuracy stayed the same when RFE was run with 0 through 15 features (see picture).

Im a stats major graduating march 2019. I am mostly applying to data analyst position due to my skillset with r programming etc. 

the current courses I am currently taking are with the following descriptions (well not for design) -hopefully this makes it helpful which might be more relevant to me and my goals. I plan to work for a year or two then go back for grad school to get a masters, am thinking of the data scientist pathway, tho still open to other careers as well. Anyways, 3 of these courses put me at full time and I just feel like I might die during finals week doing all 4. The design exp prof. is awful tbh, but need to take it. If you had to choose just 3 of these which would be more beneficial for my goals? or should I take all of them (willing to put in the work, just something inside me wants to have a more chill final quarter lol)

Design of Expiremnts (requirement to graduate)

Big Data Analytics - Basics in distributed data storage, retrieval, processing and cloud computing. Overview of methods for analyzing big data from both high dimensional statistics and machine learning - topics chosen from penalized regression, classification/clustering, dimension reduction, random projections, kernel methods, network clustering, graph analytics, supervised and unsupervised learning among others. (new course were everyone had to do a application to get in. Learning spark in it and pyspark as well a jupyter notebook.)

Advanced Statistical Models- Exponential family and generalized linear models including logistic and Poisson regression, nonparametric regression, including kernel, spline and local polynomials, and generalized additive models. Other topics as time allows: regularization, neural networks, and support vector machines. Emphasis will be on concepts and practical applications

Stochastic Process -Discrete probability models. Review of discrete and continuous probability. Conditional expectations. Simulation techniques for random variables. Discrete time stochastic processes: random walks and Markov chains with applications to Monte Carlo simulation and mathematical finance. Introduction to Poisson process.

So not sure if I should drop one and was wondering if any of you in industry would recommend to take all of them or which do you think are most important?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways to see where I am coming from, here are other relevant courses I have taken,

Statistical Machine Learning (A-), Survival Analysis(A-), Time Series(A-), Regression Analysis (A), Mathematical Statistics (B+), Mathematical Statisitics 2 (hypothesis testing, B+), Bayesian Data Analysis (B-), SAS Base programming (C+, ;/ took it in a 3 week period with proof math class in summer, a mistake), Calc 1-3 (A, A- in Calc 3), Lin Alg( A)

Im kinda interested in machine learning as I think its pretty cool.

I recently started working on my choropleth map-building skills in Python ([link to my active repo here with work in progress code](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit/blob/master/eda-and-visualization/geo_mapping_viz.ipynb)), and as you can see, I have had success building state-level maps--like the [1st one shown in Plotly's documentation here](https://plot.ly/python/choropleth-maps/). 

I wanted to move on to keep the same map layout (with Alaska and Florida in the bottom left) but move to FIPS county-level (i.e. much more granular) data, beyond the state level. Is that even possible though? I dug deep through the docs for Plotly's map functions, and it looks like the only way you can build county-level charts (like the one shown in my second link) is if Alaska and Hawaii are super far away, like they are annoyingly in Tableau, for example. 

tl;dr --&gt; is there a fancy way to reproduce the 1st example map of the US from plotly's docs, but with county-level granularity?

I also have to prove that using a GLM has better predictive performance than their current methodologies. I'll do this for the various lines of insurance this company writes for. If/when I get the trust of the underwriters, I will work toward more advanced methodologies that are more black box to help determine what a good/bad policy is or just scoring various policies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an actuarial background, so a lot of the terminology is familiar to me. But as a newer data scientist (6 months in), I've never encountered datasets like insurance data. It's heavily zero-inflated and right skewed.  I also have to consider credibility in the data, so need to weight the data by an exposure. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've spent the past 2 months just researching common insurance methodologies, and testing various models. Since it's highly zero inflated, typical measures of performance (RMSE, R\^2) aren't really useful. So then I discovered insurance has their own version of the Lorenz curve that I can extract a Gini coefficient from to compare models.  

&amp;#x200B;

The data is not linear in any form, so GLM's aren't very predictive. However, they're transparent, and I can extract multiplicative factors that underwriters can use.  I did a boosting method using a Tweedie distribution and got a model I was decently happy with, but it's so black box and I can't extract coefficient.  It gives me an idea of the ceiling though.

We currently have these components on the test bench being worn at an accelerated rate and collecting sensor data a few times a day.

There seems to be a number of effect size calculations to use - Cohen's f seems to be the most popular, but when I use this it gives me a very low sample size (assuming I'm using it correctly). Is the R^2 in Cohen's f the same as the desired Pearsons' R^2? Another thing to note is that it seems Cohen's f is generally used in social sciences so I'm not sure that this is the correct application.

Additional info: a very similar study was successfully done at my company several years ago using the same sensor with very similar components, so we know it is possible. The model created before performed beautifully, and if we were still using these old components, my work would be done. We're basically repeating the study but with the newer revision of the components being worn. I have the data from the old experiment. Is there any way I can use this to help answer my question? The previous experiment was done ""on the side"" so there was no hard deadline on project completion; they simply kept collecting data until they ran out of components to test.

Sorry if some of this is a little vague. I'm unable to give specifics on the components or sensors due to confidentiality agreements.

For example you have an image classifier, you give it an image and it labels it with ""X"" label. You flip the image and give it to the same classifier, it labels it with ""Y"" label.

Another example, you do some NER on a sentence, it returns some tags, you reformulate your sentence in a very look-alike manner, it returns some identical tags than previously and some different tags.

In both scenarios, is there a way to say ""input A is more trustable than input B""?

It can be reverse engineering with domain knowledge or whatever, but I would like to assess one input is more reliable than another.

Ideally, I would like for a given input a ""trust score"" and then decide whether I should trust the result.

For example, in my NER scenario, let's say it tags correctly some entities but some are not tagged at all (False negative). A high score will mean a high probability that all the entities were tags and that the tags are correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas ?

For the false negative part in the NER scenario, I've thought about creating a gazetteer with tokens having a high probability belonging to one of the named entities and checking afterward that a token not tagged but in the gazetteer might result in a poor prediction.

You might argue that a classifier that do not tag an input with a high probability of being tagged is a bad classifier, but in this special case of NER  and optimizing for F1 score it is not true.",10,1

I am an electrical engineer. However, I started my career as software engineer. Didn't enjoy it, so I decided to pursue MSEE. Its been 6 years now I have been working as hardware dev/ validation engineer. I am not happy with they way my career is progressing. Below average and under market pay. Few years ago I was fascinated by DS/ ML. So I completed course by prof Andrew ng on Coursera. 

Now, I am thinking about career change, again, to DS/ML.
But, I am 36 and I feel like no matter how much of an effort I put into it, I will be behind the curve. I m trying to finish Titanic submission on kaggle for a year now. It's tough balancing work, interest and personal commitments. 
I don't know if I should stick to what I know or learn what I don't know. I feel I should focus more on my software skills in python and algo instead and take a spectator approach to DS/ML.

Anyone in the same boat  as me?

 I wonder what would a recruiter think if s/he looks at my resume which seems out of focus.

You see the problem! HELP!

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone decided to move away from data science work?

I find myself not enjoying the data science aspect of my career where I've been at a start up for around 3 years and much of my role has also been Database analysts, reporting and building dashboards in Power BI and now that we have hired more people I have been focusing much more on the data science work,

But what I find I enjoy the most is the SQL querying, automating tasks and ETL in Python, and building dashboards and doing more 'Analytics' work.

&amp;#x200B;

I just find machine learning very tedious with the parameter tuning, cleaning data, running up models on EC2 etc.

I also am quite disillusioned with modem machine learning where they are very hard to interpret to the business and it might be that my maths is not strong enough to truly understand what I am doing. FYI I am a statistics and computer science major. ",9,1

I'm relatively new to the big data scene. Some context before I throw in my inquiry. 

I'm a self taught data analyst. Started career as a marketer, moved to operations, and wanted to reinvent myself as a data analyst doing customer lifecycle management after realizing that I could not carry the team further in operations.  


Currently I've been generating reports for the various department heads via excel. Part of this new year goal is to see how well we're doing on a week by week basis and react to them if we can. My question is 

1. How do most analyst calculate weekly data if first day of the month is Tuesday instead of Monday? Do they set Tuesday as the default throughout the month? For example this month of Jan 2019, where the first day is a Tuesday  

2. Following up on the first question, since Monday is part of last month's data. Should Monday be considered part of the weekly data or instead starts on Tuesday and thus it being a shorter week.

For example if I were to cluster credit card data which contained attributes such as age, salary, limit, number of cards, debt, and rating, all these attributes have discrete numeric data which I can use a euclidean square distance algorithm to calculate a similarity matrix and apply this matrix to a K-means or K-Mediod or Birch algorithm and get a cluster. 

But what if your attributes are more category based? For example, Ethnicity, County, Gender, CurrentStatus, Major, Race, Married, Student, etc? How do I measure similarity between such categories? How would I cluster a database that has such a majority of category attributes? Are there tricks in converting categories into numeric values that could potentially be used with Euclidean squared distance, or are there other similarity algorithms? 

For example on the website,[https://www.psi.toronto.edu/index.php?q=affinity%20propagation](https://www.psi.toronto.edu/index.php?q=affinity%20propagation), which the website for Affinity Propagation, there is a section for  **DETECTING REPRESENTATIVE SENTENCES IN A MANUSCRIPT** to which a similarity matrix was constructed using information coding costs. According to their paper they constructed the similarity matrix in the following way, ""To identify a small number of sentences in a draft of this manuscript that summarize other sentences, we treated each sentence as a bag of words (6) and computed the similarity of sentence i to sentence k based on the cost of encoding the words in sentence i using the words in sentence k.""

Is there an algorithm that can be used on databases which contain more category based values for records over numeric values that can construct a similarity matrix to be used with clustering algorithms like K-Means, K-Mediods, and Affinity Propagation?

\- I have taken both Intro and Intermediate Python for Data Science on DataCamp

\- I am currently reading The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book

&amp;#x200B;

\- After finishing the book, I plan to take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course that everyone seems to recommend.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I consider myself to be competent with SQL, and I have created my own relational database for a project so I am experienced and have a pretty good understanding of databases.

\- I just recently got an Data Analyst internship that I will be working at during the spring as well, but I haven't started yet.

There is a huge amount of variability between subjects with a very right skewed distribution.

The problem is, I have been asked to identify the predictions that the model is confident with, say it fits within a 95% confidence interval or something, and those that don't need to be pushed into a new process that will ask for more data which will increase the prediction accuracy.

I was hoping to get some input from more experienced data scientists on how you prefer to condense features into a manageable set. The full training sample I'm looking at is ~9,000,000 rows and only taking one hots for categorical variables with less than 150 unique values expands the sample to around 1000 features, putting me right on the border of a memory error in python. This still leaves approximately 20 categorical variables that I would be dropping from the dataset because my machine can't handle them.

My initial thought has been to take a stratified sample of around 300,000 rows, then do PCA on the continuous variables and  MCA on the categoricals then concat the two together. I'm thinking this is the best for me pipeline wise because the prince package has both fit and transform methods for these (I believe FAMD only has a fit method, so I'm unsure how that would actually transform test data). From what I've read on The Google so far, the other option is FAMD if I want to perform factor analysis on one dataframe.

My main question: How do you more experienced data scientists prefer to condense large, varied datasets? Do you have a preference between the two methods I described above? Do you spend lots of time pruning categorical variables before one hot encoding to mitigate the memory issue? (locally, I assume in a production environment something of this size or more would probably be distributed).... What else do you do in the data transformation process to condense your feature space into something workable?

Notes:

-I'm using python. That said, I don't mean to limit discussion to python implementations.

-I'm a Data Analyst. By that I mean I have a decent bit of practical knowledge of CRISP and considerations that need to be taken during the model building process. I also mean that I lack the stats background that I feel (Nay! Know!) is necessary to make truly informed decisions here.

That said, the project I'm working on has already been a tremendous learning experience for me, and running into this issue has been the icing on the curiosity cake for me. Thanks in advance for your feedback!

I'm a 2nd year community college student who will be transferring into a 4 year this fall for a BS in Statistics. I decided I'd like to work as a data analyst after graduating and was wondering how viable it is to get an internship this summer if it is even possible given they ask for students enrolled in 4 years.

Technically I'm not enrolled in a 4 year \*yet\* (and don't even know where yet), and wouldn't have that kind of status until after spring when I submit my intent to register so by then it would be way too late.

In that case what should I do in the summer? Just personal projects? All I have under my belt is math and stats prereq courses and basic programming that is required for the major (one course in C++ and one in java). It seems most data analyst internships require knowledge of Python/R/SQL which I don't have yet but could self study and work on some personal project over the summer.

I'm wondering if this will even be enough come fall when most internships open up for the next summer, it would technically be my last summer before graduating and the timeline is just so compressed since it feels like a lot of peers who went to 4 years as a freshman already have internships after their 2nd year which just doesn't feel possible with the timeline of transferring.

As a side question, should I just take MOOCs in the upcoming semester or over the summer like coursera's data science specialization? I wonder if it would help this coming fall for any analyst roles since I don't have any experience.",3,1

Some notes:

(1) I'm not a CS student. I'm a 5th year PhD student from an engineering field. My research is in scientific computing, specifically in computational physics, with use of machine learning and supercomputing. So heavy use of math (numerical methods), science, programming, parallel computing

(2) I went to UT Austin for undergrad but have no room to put this. Maybe there's something I could omit to put it in there?

(3) I have 3.8+ undergrad and grad GPAs but don't feel like putting this on there (I'm not really happy about my GPAs) unless it matters?

(4) This is resume is intended for machine learning, data science, HPC, SDE (:nervous:) positions. As such, I left my experience as mostly high level stuff without going into any detail on numerical methods or physics since I doubt anyone's going to care or understand that stuff. I only put regularized least squares in there because I guess it's a buzzword in regression analysis? Except I don't use it for regression.

This means they can combine methods and techniques to obtain the best outcome. Granted, a lot of it come out of having more experience, but having this mindset is already helpful for me to evolve into a senior data scientist.

For example, you want to predict whats the likelihood of a customer to buy a certain product given all the buying patterns of this customer. Sounds like a straightforward problem and your random forest or xgboost algorithm is perform decently, say at .65 AUC. What do you do next? Being a junior data scientist, Id do a bunch of hyperparameter tuning, testing ensemble methods, etc. to get a slight improvement. But a senior data scientist will suggest to first cluster customers into groups, then run the algorithms on each of these clusters. In many cases, this will improve the model performance, if not significantly. This is an oversimplified example of how you can combine methods to obtain a better outcome. There are many many other problems I have seen in my work that are never straightforward, and you have to think hard and be really creative to apply ML to solving them.

Hello, I'm interested in pursuing a career in data science and taking a serious look at a few masters programs.

It is essentially splitting the data into cells defined by categories, running a Bayesian logistic regression on each cell, and using the cell-level estimates to extrapolate to a different dataset. It is useful to correct measurements from a biased source.

What if anything is the difference between this and one-hot-encoding? We can also use other statistical techniques for dealing with an imbalanced class problem, but why this split?",3,1

Here's an example of the layout of 1 row - i.e., game:

&amp;#x200B;

    `Date 	year 	team 	opp 	team_score 	opp_score 	team_first downs
    2014-09-04 2014.0 SEA 	GB 	     36 	  16 	           25`
    
    `team_net pass yards 	team_total yards 	team_turnovers 	team_time of possession 
     	 191 	                  398 	              1 	        33.33` 

&amp;#x200B;

There's about 40+ more columns of potential stats for each game too. What I did was make each game 2 rows, so each team for each game has their own row with 'team' stats and 'opp' stats - as well as a \`home\` either \`0\` or \`1\` to keep track of who's playing where. Of course, there is a \`win\` column of either \`0\` or \`1\` which is the target variable. Total, the data have around 2,200 rows.

&amp;#x200B;

My ultimate goal is to have a model simulate a match-up and provide a probability of the winner; e.g., \`NYG\`:\`10%\`, \`LAR\`:\`90%\`. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is where my head unfortunately starts to spin, and I'm frankly not even sure if i've set the data up in an efficient manner. My first thought was to fit a classifier method like logistic regression/random forest (and maybe something like RFE to reduce the features) to try and predict a ""winner"" for any given game, but i'm not sure that's useful when so much has to be taken into account concerning who they're playing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering what, at first glance, the best route might be to set up such a model. Sorry if it's too broad a question, I'm happy to provide as much info as possible about the data!",15,1

First of all I want to acknowledge that I know becoming a data scientist is much more than graduating with a master's degree. But I'm not here to discuss that, I'm actually comparing 3 sets of degree pathways and asking for which one is more appealing to an employer for a data scientist role.

1st pathway - Bachelor of computer science, master of statistics

2nd pathway - Bachelor of Data science, master of statistics

3rd pathway - Bachelor of Data Science , master of IT (Data Science &amp; Engineering)

I have written a Neural network and it works for other data-sets than the one i would like it to work on, which is why i believe something is problematic with the way i handled my data. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the biggest issue is that i encoded my categorical variables (i.e. weekdays) to 0 1 2 3 4... and so on for the various weekdays, however i realise this does not do anything particularly useful due to my sigmoid activation function which pushes it to the largest or lowest categorical variable. 

&amp;#x200B;

But most importantly, my NN does not seem to converge (again, only for this specific data-set). How would you go about tackling this categorical classes issue? I was thinking of the following 2 possibilities: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) making a column for each weekday and giving 0/1 values. For example one column for Monday, one for Tuesday, etc. and then filling it with 0/1's. 

2) Taking the most frequent day and putting either 1 if it is the most frequent or 0 if it is not (or 0 if it is the second most frequent, not sure which is most suitable?)

&amp;#x200B;

As of now i have had to do a considerable amount of cleaning on this messy set and my training set is 200x300'000 , so I do not believe that I have a large P small n problem. Any suggestions would be heavily appreciated, thank you ",16,1

748,2019-1-22,2019,1,22,6,aifbah,Stuck in a BI job that wants to be data science,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/aifbah/stuck_in_a_bi_job_that_wants_to_be_data_science/,j00sr,1548106823,"Hi all, sorry if this is not the right place to post this. tl;dr at the bottom, this is a giant wall of text. 

I took a data analyst job several months ago as my first role out of college. First I would like to say that I broke what I realize now are a lot of 'cardinal rules' of the job seeing process. I regret not asking enough questions in the interview and simply being a ""yes man"", agreeing to do this and that and without quizzing the interviewer on their qualifications and what we would actually be doing. I think I was really desperate for a job and I didn't really accurately estimate my own capability. 

I have a Bachelor's in Statistics, can code in R pretty well, and am learning Python. My company is wanting to be more data-driven, not only internally but also to offer this as a service. Problem is that I am the data analyst and I report to a consultant (who is not an FTE) and my boss is a strategy officer, i.e. neither of them are data scientists nor do they have a data science-y background. 

First off, the consultant's background is business intelligence through and through. He has a surface level knowledge of platforms like Tableau and Power BI but I believe his expertise is in other, more dated platforms. He is more of an Excel guy. He doesn't know any programming. I have done some stuff that I've shown him, but he doesn't really comprehend it and I really need to be working with someone I can learn from and who can help me be better at understanding statistics and coding better. 

Secondly, there is not a lot of work right now. One of the guys in my office, a director, asks me to do some 'analytics' but it is mostly computing averages and making pie charts for his presentations. He seems to be really happy with my work (""oh wow nice job!"") but it doesn't feel that important to me, and I'm not convinced of the benefit the work is really bringing. Aside from that, I have been making dashboards, but again this is all in a BI platform and I do not leverage statistics or programming much if at all. I have asked if we have certain data so that I _can_ leverage these things, but I'm often brushed off and told that ""we don't have that data"" or that it ""would be too much work to do"". 

When seeing external opportunities, the company gravitates towards all the familiar buzzwords: machine learning, AI, data science, data analytics, predictive analytics, etc. which would be fine, if our team had that kind of capability right now. Yes I do know some stuff about these things, but not at a masters or PhD level. Our competition in terms of offering data as a service is more mature than us I imagine so I think we need to get smart fast. We can do some data stuff for existing clients, but the people in charge of communicating with those people also don't know too much about how to use data either so they don't even bother approaching us for help. 

I think the company needs to focus on becoming more data literate--better storage, usage, and understanding of data--before applying data science internally, and then once we have that taken care of we can look at external opportunities. This is something I think will take a long time to happen. I think that the CEO is serious about becoming data-driven but I don't know if the intermediate staff has the quals to make that happen. It is one thing to integrate data into your own business functions and another to offer it as a service. The company is trying to start doing both simultaneously and it needs to learn how to walk before it can run. 

Quite frankly, I don't know how much the consultant really adds to the team. I don't really need a mentor to teach me how to make a dashboard or a chart, and I've had to explain things like decision trees and ARIMA time series forecasting to him. I really wish we had a data scientist on board, but I wonder if the company believes that I am supposed to be that person without understanding what that entails. 

All signs technically point to me leaving. One on hand, I think that if we really make this department take off, it would be a good springboard for me to advance my career. On the other hand, things are growing at a snail's pace. If the company somehow becomes more realistic in its expectations then it would take a lot of the pressure off of me and I would be less stressed out. Also, I don't want to be hasty in choosing to depart before really acclimating to the role and I don't want to burn any bridges either with this being my first job.

**tl;dr:**
I have a BI role and I want to get into data science, I have a programming/stats background. My company doesn't know a lot about data and there is tremendous pressure for us to win data work in spite of this, and I don't know what to do. My so-called mentor does not have the background I want from someone I am supposed to learn from. ",0,1

I am not looking to get a job right after these courses, just something that builds a good foundation for the future. I am willing to paying up to around $1000 if it really is a good, solid program but I don't want to pay thousands of dollars just for a certificate

**My background**: I graduated 5 years ago with a BS in biochemistry. I only took first year calculus and some stat courses so I would say I don't have a very solid background in math and stats especially considering the fact that I took them a long time ago and have forgotten a lot of them. 

**My plan**:  I am going to apply for masters programs that are related to data science such as business analytics or bioinformatics but I would just like to take some courses in the meantime. I want to go into data science but I understand that it takes time so I am not looking for a job in DS anytime soon, just solid courses that provides a good, well-rounded foundation.

I've seen that one of the most tricky aspect of applying real data science outside of MOOCs, University and books in general, is the management of the dataset. In books you follow instructions of someone who know the dataset under consideration so there is no ""creative part"" or, in may opinion, it fails to communicate the way you should first step into a data set. I'm using R to perform the analysis, I have 81 features. What I've done so fare:

1. loaded the dataset into a data.frame. (easy task)
2. Started to look at the structure of the dataset by means of the str() function, to see what I'm dealing with.
3. Start to plot some variable with ggplot2, to see how these are distributed, and found immediately that there are some factors highly skewed toward a level. 

My question is how do you manage so many predictors? I mean 81 variables are no joke and I think that I shouldn't use all of them in the regression if I have no idea of what i'm doing with them. Should a run a simple regression with all predictors and the backward select predictors?

I have a data set with just over 10,000 records and 4 classes which I can merge into a binary classification problem. The one issue is that the negative class (we will call is the 'unapproved' records), make up an extremely small number of records (only 97 on there own, and possible a couple hundred if I decide to merge some more into this class). 

What is the best way to approach this problem? I know techniques for class imbalance but I would like to hear input and opinions on them too. Which algorithms might work well with this size of data on a high-level. I know knn, ensembles, and linear and non-linear svm will likely work right off the bat. And after preprocessing, I might have a large feature space (tons of nominal columns which will result in many columns and a sparse matrix once encoded). I know I can derive many, many features from some of the columns I have so k (n cols) might grow rapidly over the next few weeks. Interested on thoughts on that as well (interesting ways to deal with high dimensionality: 60 - 500 columns).

Today thanks to the help of one of my professors, I had the chance of getting an interview for an internship at a local hospital's biochemistry lab. Thankfully they seemed to like me and wanted to give me a chance to work on their data. They didn't ask me for any specific task, so I have the freedom to think about any kind of project that would mutually benefit both me and them and I will hopefully have their support on whatever ""project"" I come up with. I'm very happy and eager to learn about data science but as a newbie in this field I need you guys' guidance on what I can do. 
- The hospital is a public hospital in a developing country, and Ive noticed that they are mostly using older technology for their data related work (storage and analysis). I will have access to their patient data to some extent, which I imagine could be fed to some machine learning-driven system to aid them in their analyses? Maybe theres some new software I can introduce to them that may boost their quality of life in terms of the way they handle their data?

I would almost like to classify that as stealing. First of all I think a banks purpose should be to support a person financially. However, just because the company is profit driven money comes first and customer last. The specific example that I would be using is around credit cards. Banks use low interest rate offers with the hope that some customers fall into this trap of becoming a revolver (I have actually sat in conversations where people have said this). They want to make sure that the information for them is not fully transparent so as to sneak in some fees or late payment fees etc. Anyway given how accessible information is these days, I was wondering why there is no credit card app which would basically create a monthly forecast for you based on your real time purchases and budget to make sure one does not go overboard with spending. The purpose of this app would be to make sure that people are more aware of their purchases along with the forecast telling them where they would hit their budget (over/under) based on history.

&amp;#x200B;

So this data I've been looking at has 15,000 patients with 100 different columns. Each patient was one of 10 different studies, in each study around 50% have been given certain treatment and I'm looking to see if this treatment affects the death rate (will be doing some ML clustering).

In the whole data-set, each study is different: one is only for 60+ aged people (200 patients), another includes people with a certain disease (2000 patients). So all of these are put together: an issue is that each study only took in certain data. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a data frame (Python) and I'm unsure which columns/variables to get the best amount of data from it.

The 'guy in charge' said to use 40 columns from a list he gave and he wants to have as many patients from each study as possible. After collating these 40 variables/columns and removing all rows which obtain a blank, there were 10,000 patients/rows remaining. I noticed that half of the studies were completed removed because there were no recordings of a certain column/variable.

&amp;#x200B;

When I did some tests and used around 10 columns, I found that all studies were included and 14,000 rows remained. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trying to decide what my plan is: I need to use more variables/columns, but I don't want to remove too many studies from the whole set. So far, study 3 (200 patients) and 6 (350 patients) can easily be removed and a few more columns added, leaving me with 13,500-ish rows left.

I am taking two data science related courses this semester and I think I will like it. I personally believe data will be more important in the future. I am not big fan of AI/ML but I am interested in data minimg, cleaning, scrapping. So I guess data engineering is maybe a good career path for me.

1. Replaced some NaNs
2. Deleted columns with &gt;250,000 missing values
3. Split up the data set into X, y and transformed the X values
4. Normalized the X values
5. Created dummies for the categorical columns
6. Ran logistic regression on this data set

The data set seems to be okay. There is nothing off about the ratios  or anything. I am not sure what I am doing wrong since the precision,  recall seem to be super high for both the test and train data set.

So, this post isn't a perfect fit for this sub because this is for a computational linguistics position but that subreddit looks kiiinda dead so I thought here would be better. That being said, I suspect that this position is more data sciencey because of my background so maybe y'all can help :)

Just to give you an idea of my background: I'm a PhD candidate in cognitive science and my research is in computational models of language processing. So my everyday work essentially involves designing linguistic behavioral experiments, statistics (alll the R!), computational modeling of behavior (mostly Bayesian models of cognition if you're familiar), and a tiny bit of NLP here and there.

Anyway, I ended up getting an interview for a computational linguistics internship at Google. I have basically no idea what the initial interview is going to be like -- all I know is that it's supposed to be the general technical interview and my interviewer won't be from the team that's interested in me or anything like that. 

I've practiced some of the typical coding interview questions in the past but some are definitely way out of my league since I'm not a computer scientist. But since this isn't for a computer science position, am I less likely to be asked those kinds of questions? For people who have experience with technical interviews at google that weren't for computer science positions, what (general) kinds of questions were you asked for the coding interview?

Some might say its the only way to arrive at knowledge. But what questions does science answer? Science only analyzes existing *concepts*, and there is no scientific research before a *concept* is created. It is widely known that philosophy is preoccupied with concept creation, and its not until a *concept* is declared by philosophy, when a scientific field spawns to study it.

Every individual who had a new idea struggled getting acknowledgment from the community, Galileo Galilei was condemned not just by the Church, but by the scientific community too. Einsteins relativity theory was rejected by most physicists at first, and Einstein himself would not accept anything in quantum theory, no matter how many individuals supported it. Thomas Edison was committed to DC current, and considered Teslas AC unsafe for years. Maybe we should be more open minded if we dont want to fall into the same trap, and repeat the same mistakes over  and over again.

I am working on a project to analyze retention/churn for an organization that offers educational courses to the community, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to determine the churn rate for each individual. At this org, classes are offered throughout the year, each starting on different dates and running for different periods of time. There's no obligation to students, so they might take 6 in a row or take 1 every 6 years, meaning that the point of churn can be vastly different for each student.

I have the raw registration data, which includes the registration date, course start dates, and end dates for each registration (among other things). I've been trying to work off of a simple formula of Churn Factor = Time Since Last Activity (\[Longevity -Recency\]/\[# Active Days -1\])/Activity Frequency. However, this doesn't take the length of programs into consideration - meaning that a customer who registered in December could still be active today (or not), and it's obviously wonky for one-time customers.

Normally my coefficients act as an elasticity pretty reliably, so I can communicate that a change in one variable results in certain % change in the Y, but how do I break that apart over past data?

For example, you have a model that predicts computer sales. In your model you have a coefficient for seasonality, price, distribution, and holidays. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume these variables capture the majority of the variance. We ran an extra sale for a few weeks in winter to combat the normally poor performing winter computer sales, but we also lost distribution (a slowdown in production for unforeseen reasons). Overall, we saw a 1% increase in sales vs. a year ago. You think the sale was a success, but some of the stakeholders believe the sale was a flop, because it should have given a 5% increase in sales.
You run your model over past 2 years of data, and try to explain the contribution of each variable to the final increase/decrease in sales. Is it possible to say: based on the inputs of the variables from the past weekly data, my model would have predicted that the seasonality effect would have brought sales down X%, while the distribution loss brought sales down Y%, but the promotion resulted in an increased Z% sales? This added together resulted in the 1% increase we saw. If the Z% is equal or greater than 5%, then I could argue the promotion was a success, and should be repeated again. Has anyone done someone similar, is this even possible?  

Hi All, I asked this question in r/statistics, but did not get many replies.  It is possible I am not describing my question well because I do to know the name of what I am asking. One person suggested causal inference, but that seems to be overkill for what I am doing.  Thanks for all your help!

I'm curious about everyone's thoughts on the level of requirement for a Masters of some kind, for data science, as well as the usefulness of it for someone in my positions.

First off, I have a BFA in Oil Painting.

Secondly, I already have a job as a Data Analyst.

I was hired as a tech support phone jockey for a start-up a year and a half ago.  We did not have any DA/DS people then.  A csv file, a question, a tableau-trial, and an answer changed my entire career path.  After some more questions and more answers we picked up some Tableau licenses and I got a new job title.

Now I mostly do stats and viz, but I want to get into some of the heavier DS aspects.  I'm currently still the only member of our DS/DA team and I manage all of the internal stakeholder requests (soon to add external) and all content for a Tableau server with 30 users.

I've done some python courses as well as pair-prog. with a jr. dev on an nlp project I started for the company.  I've also read a few stat textbooks, viz books, blogs, O'Reily pdfs, and anything else I can get my hands on.

So: Is an MS mainly beneficial for getting in the door and making connections and I'd be better off sticking to self-learning, or would it be worth my time since I don't have a Math, CS, or other typical background?

How do I reshape the data in python so i could use it on LSTM where the input will be the whole batch of 1200 inputs and the output will be the 48 hours.

I've been at a startup for about 7-8 months. Before me, they had a few back-end devs doing a lot of data engineering work. But I'm the first DS to join the company and leverage our data. Something I noticed a few weeks ago was that I'm pretty off and on about documentation and wanted to focus on that a bit more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to get a proper documentation flow down for 

1) Our Databases 

2) Problem Statements - General brainstorming 

3) Workflow 

4) End Product

For now, I was going to use confluence. Initially, when I started I was documenting our DBs and its schema. However, that has slowed down a bit. (Personally, I  don't like the style that I've chosen to document the DBs. I just created a table in Confluence with a few columns, that name the table, describe what it contains, identifies the primary and foreign keys).

Does anyone have any tips on how to go about creating documentation and maintaining it? Are there any other processes I need to consider documenting?

I thought I wanted to sit for the CPA but realized that's not for me.  I managed to get into a data analyst role and am very interested in continuing down this path. I'm not ready to say I want to be a data scientist, as that seems to be a common buzzword, but I'm very interested in analytics and it's applications in business.

I am very interested in in Georgia Tech's MS in Analytics.  I've learned a good amount of programming/software development on my own, but feel I'm lacking a solid foundation in things like data structures, algorithms, etc., that would help in with admissions to the masters program as well a career in analytics. I was thinking I could follow self-taught route found on GitHub ([https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#core-cs](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#core-cs)) but recently found out I got accepted into the online Post-Bacc CS program at OSU.  While I'm excited, this program isn't exactly cheap ($28K).  My company only covers $2100 a year for tuition reimbursement and while it's better than nothing, in order to complete the program in a timely manner, I'd have to pay out of pocket a good portion.

Is the second bachelors in CS worth it?  Should I continue down the self-taught route and see if that's enough to gain admission to the program?  I know they offer a micro masters which allows you to take three of the courses that are part of the masters program, and if you do well in them, can help with admission to the masters program.  My hesitation of doing self-taught is that I feel like a BS in CS would open more doors for me.  It would show I have a solid foundation in fundamentals.  On the flip side, it's expensive.  There's plenty of online courses out there (edX, Coursera) that I could do and get certificates for but I'm hesitant that they just won't carry the same weight and foundation as a Bachelors in CS would.

Any advice would be appreciated.

When visualizing data, one can often encounter a problem when it is required to draw some items related to the pixel size and not to the scene. This can be especially useful when one needs to draw some additional information around some point or enable the interaction of items with the mouse or touch screen. It is convenient when the size of such items (in pixels) is constant and independent on the zoom, projection, perspective distortion and other factors.

[AtomicusChart](https://atomicuschart.com) offers a very simple solution to this problem by drawing Markers. All that the user is required to do is to wrap the data into Marker type. Below, a basic example of Markers usage is provided:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7ywufgu6u7d21.png

So here is the result using different zoom options:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lwpsoud8u7d21.png

**Examples**

Thus, when one needs to display some specified points of measurement on the surface, he can perform this task using the capabilities of AtomicusChart in the following way:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/nyj16vf9u7d21.png

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vr9l0nmau7d21.png

In addition, AtomicusChart allows one to easily display the orientations of normal for each vertex.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/q3q0zfjbu7d21.png

Besides, AtomicusChart can display anything as a marker object. The example given below illustrates the data itself as marker objects.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ln7qr8gcu7d21.png

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/m1p1aerfu7d21.png

**Use cases:**

Different interactive AtomicusChart tools are based on the Markers data type. It is very advantageous since the markers do not override the data when the scene is zoomed and they have always an appropriate size to be caught by the mouse or touch panel.

&amp;#x200B;

So in essence my company has several clients and we are trying to predict the time to the next event of each of these clients based on several attributes (Roughly 60 datapoints.)We're using this as an alternative of a churn model and eventually want a probabilistic outcome where we attach a probability of an event occurring within; 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm having is that as a starter we're trying to predict the actual time to next event from a Regression standpoint on a monthly basis. The issue is that given the nature of the data I could have several rows associated with the same client for the same month. Now one thing I could do is aggregate some of the columns to collapse the rows, but given we're using a month figure, the amount of data some of these companies will have will be ultimately fairly small. I wanted to see is there another method that I'm missing, where I could retain my multiple rows, but still have said rows attributed to only a single response?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm creating a custom small-scale transaction matching script that checks two sources are the same and spits out the differences. Only talking around 20,000 lines.

Each source has roughly a date, type, ID, amount and a description.

Couple key points that make this a non-trivial exercise:

* Date's can be mismatched (usually same or 1-2 days off, rarely more than a week).
* ID's are not identical eg. '700' vs '3.700 E.SOL'.
* Amounts are usually close but not exact.
* The big one - some transactions are in bulked into one line from one source and split into multiple transactions on the other. IE. 1 Trans for $1,000 should match to 5 Trans for $200 each.

My solution so far is to (for each transaction in the 'main' source):

* Create a ""blocking"" of possible matches from the second source (ie. only search transactions within +/- 1 week of the original date) to reduce computation. 
* Map each potential match with individual scores on similarity of each feature type, date, ID, amount (fuzzy match with jaro/lehvenstein distance for ID strings)
* Use a custom scorer to sum each similarity into one probability. 
* Set a threshold and mark transactions as matched when reached.

This doesn't solve my 1 vs many transactions (will need to do some sort of grouping) but I was curious if anyone has better ideas on how to utilise ML to improve on this? I can think of plenty of hand-crafted features that could help determine more accurate similarity.

Im currently 32 years old and working as a Financial Analyst for a global commercial real estate company. I have kind of a strange role where Im part FP&amp;A (forecasting and budgeting financials) and business analytics (mostly working with Tableau). Unfortunately, Im kind of still stuck in an entry level position, largely due to a lack of available responsibilities and a manager who doesnt really believe in the business analytics side and only views me as half of a financial analyst who doesnt put together enough Powerpoint presentations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this Ive really soured on the FP&amp;A side of my job, and what to expand more into business analytics and potentially data science. I get a lot more enjoyment from cleaning large data sets and explaining them than I do setting T&amp;E budgets for brokers....

&amp;#x200B;

I have very limited experience coding in Tableau and VBA. I also have an MA in Economics where I received some exposure to Stata and eViews. So Im not necessarily a stranger to these kind of programs, though I know R and Python can be completely different animals. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive gotten some mixed responses as to whether something like an MS in Data Science would be worth it in my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some people say since I already have MA in economics and work for a large firm, I may be better off taking free courses and try to find practical ways to improve the business.

&amp;#x200B;

Others suggest that having an MA in Economics and a MS in data science could be a powerful combination and could open a lot of doors.

So, some small note about me, I'm pretty much stepping my first steps into machine learning. I have some background in statistics/econometrics but I'm not really knowledgable about this. If you have any tips how could I improve and learn more about machine learning, working with R or getting job as data analyst  - I appreciate. 

**So what is even going on?**

I'm pretty sure you are all familiar with pokemon. Some of you are familar with pokemon showdonw - online platform where people can play 6v6, compete in tournaments, climb on a ladder and many more. Because there are major differences between in power among different pokemons, they are segregated in hierarchical structures called tiers. In base tier - OU - you can use pretty much anything. However only mons used more than ~3,4% they are in that category. 


In tier below - UU - you can use anything but those mons which are used more than ~3,4% in OU. In tier belwo UU - RU - you can use anything but those used in UU and OU. And in tier below - you get the idea. 

I decided to build classifier that using characteristic of given mon, so it's:

* stats (attack, defence, sp. attack, sp. deffence, hp and speed)
* typing (18 base typings plus potential 306 double typings)
* ability (couple hunted)
* and moveset 

To predict in which tier it lands. However given limited sample (average tier is ~40-50 mons) I just cannot use all this info. So my first take was just using stats and typing (as dummy variable). I wrote couple classifiers (logistic regression, svm, classification tree, random forest), and get pretty consistent score with about 50-55% in sample acc (beside random forest, which consistently performed the worst). Pretty bad.

My second take was a little bit different. Instead of using typing as binary variable, I rewrite it as combination of effectiveness. So still 18 columns, but  now it's 0 for neutral effectiveness, 1 for not very effective, 2 for 1/4x effective and 3  for immunity. Acc rise a bit, now best classifer, svm with polynomial kernel achieved 67% in sample acc.

However my happiness lasted until I decided to split sample to training set and test set. Then classifier managed to archive only 40%.

Because of turn based nature of pokemon showdown battles and plenty of data I'm thinking about creating much more models, maybe even one day model which would be deep learining base AI, similar to deep mind. However, given complexity of task in contrast to my own skill and knowledge - it will not come any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Got my first contract as an analyst writing a research paper for someone. Was told expected time to finish was between 80-120 hours. The advertised position had an hourly rate which I agreed to and therefore charge in hours. I have done approx. 45 hours of work and am almost finished. Contractor seems happy and wants to approach me about more work.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem Im having is this - 1. The rate is quite low, which is understandable for my first contract position

2. I don't know how I should be charging, I add a few hours here and there for the extra time it takes during tax time but I feel like I'm undercutting myself and not getting the value I deserve

Should I just charge another 35 hours even if I only work 20 and consider it a job well done because I finished the contract on the better side of expectations? Even though I'm not explicitly working I spend a good deal of my day thinking through things in my head, even when I'm at my other day job.

Charging strictly the hours I'm working seems like I'm undercutting myself what I deserve, but I am an honest person and adding a huge chunk of time I wasn't sitting in front of my computer coding/writing seems wrong. Can I have any guidance as to expectations and what I should do?",4,1

This is my first time posting here and, to be honest, I'm not sure if this question is applicable here, but I couldn't think of any other subs to ask this question in. I know it may be out of place, so if you know of any better places for me to ask about this sort of thing, I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.

I'm trying to build a very simple question-answer system where a user can enter a question and, based on the words or keywords in their question, return a result from a set consisting of keywords. Ideally, the returned set of keywords would be the most accurate and representative of all possible stored sets that was searched against.

Currently I'm doing it rather naively and essentially giving each set a ""score"", where a point is assigned for each word that is shared between both the query and the candidate results. 

An example of the current system for you (very basic, would be larger in production):

Query: ""best new phone of ces 2019""

Candidate results:

* top, **best**, **phone**, **ces**, **2019** (score: 4)
* **best**, student, **phone** (score: 2)
* **new**, dell, laptop, **2019**, gaming (score: 2)

Now this works well for somewhat explicit searches like I have outlined above (the first candidate result would be returned as it has the highest score), but when either the searches are more vague or the candidate results overlap heavily, there exists the case where either two candidate results can tie (i.e. same scores), or where the wrong result is returned. I can't remember the exact scenario that I had where it returned the wrong results.

Another method I tried for the score was assigning one point for each matching keyword and subtracting one for each keyword that wasn't shared, but that ended up punishing larger candidate sets.

Anyways, this is the question I have for you. Ideally without involving some heavy algorithms or training sets, what other methods could I use to try to predict the most accurate set? Again, I feel this isn't exactly the largest or most intense problem to solve, but I've been thinking it over for a few days and I'd love some feedback or insight, if possible.

Many thanks in advance!

In February 2001 Eric helped capture the most notorious spy in United States history, Robert Phillip Hanssen. In the three months preceding Hanssens arrest, Eric was selected to work with the spy, charged with gaining Hanssens trust and slowly drawing the traitor out of deep cover.

I don't have much experience so I don't have a lot of intuition about how changing certain parameters will change the training time of my models. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I just downloaded the typical MINST numeral recognition dataset. Before starting to figure out neural networks with it, I wanted to try some more classic techniques that I was already familiar with just to be able to compare results. I PCA'd it down to 40 features and ran a KNN classifier, pretty arbitrarily starting off with 4 neighbors weighted by distance. It worked better than I expected (97% accuracy) so I decided to roll with it and used GridSearchCV to compare k = 1, 10, 100, and 1000 both weighted and unweighted. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I run into is after sitting here for about an hour waiting for the grid search to finish, I start to wonder whether I'm spending my time in the most efficient way possible. I'm coming from MATLAB where I used to be able to pause my code mid-execution and see how far it'd gotten so I could determine whether or not it would take an inordinate amount of time to finish. But here in a Python environment after my code has been running for an hour I have no idea if it's just about to finish or if it'll take the next two days. Will training a k=1000 model be significantly faster/slower than a k=1 model? What about weighted/unweighted? Is the relationship between sample size and time linear or worse? What about the relationship between dimensions and time? How would I figure any of this out without asking the internet? How do I decide when to stop my training and when to wait it out? ",9,1

* **Information Systems (School of Business)**
   * *Pros*: I *love* business classes, the business school is selective and I'm already in it, not too computer heavy, if I choose this path I can achieve my MBA in less than a year due to the duel program
   * *Cons:* Differential tuition, will have to learn coding on own time, probably the least wisest choice for a data science career lmao
* **Information Science**
   * *Pro's***:** Includes data science specialization - has aspects of coding, stat, and data analysis all put together; imo this is the perfect blend to get started with data science and is what I want to switch my major too
   * *Con's:* New program so not much information, some people claim it to be a watered down computer science major
* **Computer Science**
   * *Pro's***:** Also includes a data science specialization, large program so great professors and classes offered, a lot of variability in electives
   * *Con's***:** Very computer heavy obviously (I get burnt out with coding *easily* if it's not data/stat related), differential tuition, all computer classes in high school made me hate my life -- I'd probably be better off learning coding in my own time?
* **Statistics**
   * *Pro's:* I love statistics. Like fucking love it. This is my shit. 
   * *Con's*: I'm scared that being so immersed in statistics will make me burn out, I've never hit a ""block"" in any math class before and hitting it in college sounds like a nightmare and I don't know if I'll ever be able to bypass it (if that made sense LOL)",3,1

So I've been offered an new position as a Data Analyst at my company, but I have some serious concerns. I have virtually no experience, I have been doing QA for my previous job, and I put together a few dashboards for QA results using Excel, and used Access and SharePoint to run the QA process.

I'm pursuing my degree as well, in data analysis/statistics, but I'm only in my second year.

Not only am I inexperienced, but I will be virtually the only data analyst in the building. My team is management and I will be doing the analysis as well as suggesting process improvements.

So I am inexperience, and no one around me has experience either. Like I said: without a paddle.

Since getting the job, I've looked at the tools I can get, these include: Oracle SQL Developer, Alteryx, RStudio, and Git.

I feel like I am so behind and so overwhelmed with what to learn next. I don't know whether to study up on statistics, on modeling, on visualizations, on programming/scripting, or on specific tools (such as R).

So I'm looking for some advice: 1) What should I learn FIRST that would give me the most benefit early on 2) is there any kind of ""crash course"" for analytics or data science?

I am about to finish my PhD in economics at a good European university (5+3 program, 5 years of Bachelors and Masters + 3 years of PhD) and I am eyeing on jobs involving data science in the industry/in tech as I don't see myself in academia in the long run. My experiences include behavioural and experimental economics as well as a whole bunch of (micro-)econometrics and structural modelling. I know that industry/tech companies hire some economists, so I am sure that i would find a job *somewhere*.

The issue is that I have the offer for a 18 month postdoc at my university on a project which would involve machine learning and further experimental stuff (applied in a public economics settings which is really interesting).  On paper this sounds like a good asset to have, especially as my experience in machine learning is rather limited to the basics and I could build up this skill for a further career in data science. I am however skilled in R and Python/Pandas.

My question is now, for you guys that are working in data science, would this pay off? Or would it be just as good to leave academia now, build up some solid machine learning skills with coursera/keggle on the side? What are you experiences?

I am thankful for any kind of input!

Could you recommend me a platform or a tool which enables me to create data dashboards that we can broadcast to our office's TV? We are currently using [www.databox.com](https://www.databox.com), but it has some limitations... (ex.: we cant fetch YTD data from Shopify....)

Output wise I need to have a clear indicator of what they are talking about, such as some keywords (k-means clustering comes to mind) 

Our dataset is not that big, only 450 texts for now, it will get bigger in time once the methodology is set.

So I am thinking about running cosine similarity to identify which texts are similar, and then cluster them based on similarity -which is the part I am most confused about how to perform- and then run a k-means clustering on each cluster, to see what sort of things they are talking about with more detail.

In the step between cosine similarity and k-means, I am not sure how to approach the clustering part based on their similarity.

Would anyone have any suggestions? Thank you",9,1

I'm running several different text processing codes and while loading/saving big text files (e.g. csv) and processing/saving them as pandas dataframes or CSVs i constantly run out of memory. seems like i have reached the pandas limit. Say even shuffling the data would already be an issue as all my data may not fit into RAM memory to be shuffled. 

Now the question is before I write a hack around this problem myself, what is the standard approach in the community ? what would be the suggested frameworks/libraries and file systems to use? by researching a bit I constantly run into Spark or Hadoop Mapreduce frameworks together with HDFS file systems but since their main purpose is to distribute the work across a number of nodes in a cluster i'm not quite sure it'd be solution to my problem.

Any hint/suggestion would be more than appreciated.",25,1

My organization has recently remonikored half the devs as data scientists. Frontend developer? Data scientist. Read a pandas tutorial? Data scientist. Loaded a csv into a graph? Data scientist.

I get the whole ""what is a data scientist?"" thing and how it's a meme, but trust me... They are not even data analysts beyond innate critical thinking skills.

Anywho, my point wasn't to whine about it - I'm simply curious how other teams experience this and what they think organizational impact is.

The reasons are obvious - perception. My concern long-term is the whole... ""If everyone's idea is good, then there are no bad ideas"" fallacy. Leads to long-term disenchantment and an emphasis on showing off vice showing results, which I'm already seeing.",181,1

Im doing data science at my current job just by chance even though I was originally hired as a software engineer.

I always left off my 3 years of bioinformatics research experience because employers never gave a fuck about it (granted these were for regular software engineer positions).

Didnt get any publications but I spent the summers in the lab 9-5 and would work 10 hours a week during the school year over the course of those 3 years.

I worked with real data and used python and various bioinformatics related software to conduct data analysis.

Now that Im pivoting towards data science, should I include this experience?
