I do social science research (one man team) and prediction and I want to have low-medium level data analysis in my toolbox (using libraries like scikit, but sometimes innovating or coding myself).

I see myself scraping data, using social media API's and importing CSVs from world bank etc. Then I would need to do basic statistics and machine learning and rarely distribute single use products to clients.

I'm finishing up MIT edx 6.001, an intro to CS in python and am at a crossroads. Should I put in the overhead to learn numpy and the other packages to make python scientific computing ready, then learn the data packages like scikit, statsmodels, pandas etc Or, learn julia with its already complete array and linalg features and use pycall+ python packages to makeup for missing julia libraries.

I would go python, but it seems julia has some advantages, may reduce the overhead in the long run (are we all going to switch to it eventually? also consistent type declaration from within the base code, not having to learn each package etc)

I also would want to do OS scripting etc. Would appreciate any feedback.

Thanks!

* Important distinctions in the field: how can I differentiate between what one data scientist does v another?
* What does the breakdown of your day look like? I understand the basics: programming, modeling, interpreting.. but is it usually a solo gig? working in teams?
* What skills do you think someone start off in the field needs to have? Someone 5, 10, 15 years in?
* How do you define your skills? How does your skill set market you for what you want to be doing on a daily basis?
* Where do you see yourself going with your degrees/skills? Moving to management, more advanced research?

I currently work as an analyst at a start up. I have a background in stats and also some background in IT I haven't used in a while. I started as a junior analyst during my PhD studies and over the course of less than 2 years became the head analyst. This was my first real job. I have started reading a lot and learned R (I used SPSS before) and started using it for my analyses. I also realiseded I need to learn more about machine learning and re-learn some programming if I am to become a data scientist. Now at this job I have the opportunity to come out with ideas to test (which I like to think I am pretty good at). I have influence on what data is collected  and how it is used. The downside is that the data access sucks (ticketing export system, but it should change over the course of a year). Another minus is the fact, that I have no one to peer learn from (I have one intern who is still a student) and generally can't get a different (analytical) perspective on my approaches and ideas. This company deals with paywalls which while not exactly a popular have great potential in terms of patterns discovery and I believe I could really come up with something solid. This company also allows me to travel.

During January I, out of curiosity interviewed with a company establishing offices within our country. They deal with advertising, but have some innovative tools and attributes in place. The position was a regular data analyst with prospects to rise higher. They seemed very enthusiastic. I did a skype interview and a test (data analysis assigment).  My impression was that they know their stuff (more than I do at this moment) and that they know the things I need to learn (at least the people in the HQ which is within another country). They also plan to hire more than a dozen data analysts for the same offices. They offered me a higher pay and more vacation time. They have good data infrastructure. I probably won't be able to travel or have any conference trips covered (might change). On the other hand there is a three weeks initial training in the company HQ which I believe could be a great experience.

I talked to my current employer and got a comparable counter offer in terms of pay and got offered company shares. In terms of learning they offered to cover me going to data science conferences of my choice. They also think about hiring one more analyst (either as my replacement or to work as my subordinate).

My question is about your experience - do you think it is better to learn from peers and the company on the job? Or should I value being able to go to data science conferences abroad more? Sometimes I feel like there is a lot that I need to learn, but I am unsure on when to start. At other times I think dropping an opportunity to really build the whole thing from scratch in my current employment is something I shouldn't abandon lightly and learn by myself. I am also a quick learner. 

If my current IT (in terms of programming and implementation) and machine learning knowledge is not that in-depth, does it even make sense to attend data science conferences? What is your experience in learning when you compare on the job training versus conferences?

I feel as if having the two jobs reversed in their order would have made much more sense, but that is not something I could change.

Recently, I've been learning some introductory programming through Treehouse, Codecademy, edX, Cousera, Udacity and similar MOOCs. Still entry level, but planning to take a gap year (starting May 2014) to do some face-to-face courses, get in touch with the community and expand my knowledge of code. 

A few months ago, I decided to focus my studies in data science. Found the 'Open Source Data Science Masters' and I am willing to complete all the courses listed. I am also planning to do the Coursera specialization on data science (good idea?). When I feel more secure about my knowledge of the topic, I am planning to start collaborating in a few open data projects and incorporate data science in my journalistic work.

I was also wondering: being self-taugh and not having a degree on Math or CS, but assuming my knowlodge of DS will be very solid, can I dream about grabbing jobs as a data scientist? Should I forget that? Employers and data scientists take MOOCs in consideration? What path should I take to work as a data scientist without a proper degree? 

As I said, I am a professional writer interested in technology, currently learning code and expanding my knowledge in data science, planning to study the topic in-depth during this year and the next one. I don't have the time or patience to start an undergraduate program focused on math or CS, but I can do shorter courses in places like the Open Data Institute, General Assembly...

New user here. I originally made a post in the grad school sub, but I'm wondering if it would be better to post here. I've included the link below. My apologies for the length.

TLDR: I've been accepted into two separate master degrees at Indiana University-Bloomington. One is an MA in Latin American Studies and the other is a MS in Information Science in the school of Informatics and Computing. I have the option to do a dual program and receive both degrees simultaneously, but I'm not sure what to do. I have a strong interest in research, but I also wouldn't mind working for a while after the MS. I'm specifically interested in Information Architecture and working to create more efficient and easily accessible databases. I'm also interested in improving research tools (ie. citation programs and things like RefWorks).

I've included a link to the programs below, and I'll be talking to the programs themselves, but I'm trying to get as much input as possible before I make my decision. Thanks!

Dual program:

Just MSIS with a specialization in Data Science

MSIS with Information Architecture specialization

EDIT: Is there an advantage to pursuing the second masters in Latin American studies in addition to doing information science to pursue a career in data science and information architecture?

Its been nearly 8 months since i landed this job and i've been working in Big Data projects till now.. They are offering a Data Science Fast Track course at the place i work and i applied.. They're having an interview on monday. I'm really excited but also equally scared.


Will be having a video conference with the data science team stationed at the US. 

Can you guys tell me how i can prepare for it better?
