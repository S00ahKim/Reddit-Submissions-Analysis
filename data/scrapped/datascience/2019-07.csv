I'm an Australian in my mid-twenties currently working at a financial institution and am looking for some advice from the pros I see frequenting these parts. I got my Bachelors degree in IT this year and have worked as a Software Dev and BI Analyst/Dev but I want to pivot more into Data Science because I find it seriously interesting and it scratches a statistical itch for me.

My first thought was to pursue an online Masters course at an Australian University however the course content and pricing put me off. Most of the options I've seen either are too expensive (AUD $46,000) or the course is at a fair price (approx. AUD $26,000) but the content is lacking. 

This led me to research my options online and I found edX. There are a number of courses on there however I'm considering the following:

1. [Data Science MicroMasters - UC San Diego](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/uc-san-diegox-data-science) [Price: USD $1,260]
This one stood out to me because UC San Diego also have a Masters degree on edX (coming soon) and this MicroMasters strikes me as a cheap way to dip my toes in the water. In addition to this, the masters program is only USD $15,000, which is significantly cheaper than those on offer here in Australia. As far as I can tell, this is a fairly decent school too.

2. [Statistics and Data Science MicroMasters - MIT](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science) [Price: USD $1,350]
This one seems to be held up as the best MOOC for Data Science. It covers Python which I would prefer to focus on over R, it is from a reputable school and it has a good reputation. Only thing that it doesn't have over the UC San Diego offering is that there is no direct pathway to a Masters however it is possible to use this course as credit towards a Masters at some Universities in Australia (RMIT and Deakin, both decent schools).

If anyone has any advice, guidance or suggestions I would love to hear them!

As a result I was placed on a development plan, which I think I can make it out of but i just don't think I can hack it here at this point in my life so I started looking elsewhere for work opportunities.

I interviewed at a Series B start up that has an interesting problem space and looks like might be a better fit in terms of research and growth. The original job posting just said 'data scientist' and didn't specify years of experience required, as far as i can recall. There are about 20 other DS, split across 2 teams, and they're looking to double the team in the next year.

I apparently did pretty well in the onsite as they made an offer, with a $50K increase in base pay. I'm certainly not underpaid right now so that much of an increase came as a bit of a shock but I thought 'Hey, maybe they've increased the base pay because there's no sign on bonus, or they're offering stock options which might ultimately not be worth anything.' Since it was an exploding offer and I didn't have anything else in hand at the time, I decided to accept with a start date a few months from now.

I got the contract last week and the role I thought I was accepting has changed from data scientist to lead data scientist. But I only have 1.5 years of experience and feel in no way ready to take on such a role, especially considering the dumpster fire my first job was.

In the past I've been to that last interview a couple of time but every time they ended up choosing the other candidate and told me that everything was really great with me - friendly, strong knowledge of statistics, smart... - but they preferred the candidate with ""a specific experience"", i.e., someone who has been at a similar position before, obviously not my case!

Now I've reached again the last interview level, and I'll really love to work for this company! I've had two interviews with them already and I've passed their coding challenge. The job is a data scientist position in R&amp;D (good for me) at a financial startup.

The only advantage I see from Tableau/PowerBI over SAP are the cool charts (sankey, chord...), a more beautiful (IMO) interface and a better time filters management, which from my point of view are not enough reasons to change, given the fact that a lot of time and money would need to be invested.

I have a project where I aim to build a database on a specific investor type from Pitchbook, an online SaaS. Due to the required data needed however, there are a few issues I would like someone with more experience with this service to comment on (maybe general knowledge is enough). Lets say I have three different ""layers""  of data needed for each investor in a list of 100 investors: 1.  investor data (name, country), 2. each deal made  by investor (location,sector) and 3. investment data per deal (amount, date, round).  

However, for each investor data downloaded, like name and its country the deal data is not downloaded. This means that for each investor I need to also specifically download the deals data, however these deals are not tied to this investors specifically through an ID. I have thought about this and only think about downloading and creating different worksheets basically, and then somehow combine it in a final worksheet? Being successful in this first step would then mean I can import and organise the data in Stata, where it is to be merged with another another data set  containing the same and potentially other investors. In this case I assume Stata's merge may be used. Hope anyone with Pitchbook experience can pitch in.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Last year my university began offering a data science major. I saw this as a great opportunity to start a student organization, all about data science. I would love to know if you have any thoughts/advice/suggestions; things that would make this experience valuable for undergraduate students.

&amp;#x200B;

A little more context - I started the club at the beginning of last year. We've had regular meetings and a pretty healthy amount of regular members. Right now, we just have professors from the university coming in to talk about things that I thought would be interesting/valuable to prospective data scientists. We've also been trying to organize toy projects for people to work on, to learn the basics of Python, working with data, SciKit-Learn, command prompt, GitHub, etc. We are receiving a lot of great support from faculty and staff on campus. Next fall, I want to start getting data scientists in industry to come speak to us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a few specific questions that I'm interested in:

* What are some key areas that don't get covered in undergrad programs, that we could talk about at the club?
* How do I find and convince actual data scientists (or engineers, analysts, statisticians, etc) to come talk to us? What should I ask them to talk about so it's not the same thing every time?
* Coordinating a group project has been very challenging. In your opinion, is this a valuable exercise or a huge sink of time that would be better spent on something else?
* If you were recruiting data scientists/engineers/analysts, what would make this organization stand out to you?
* Any other general thoughts/concerns about the idea?

One of the options I'm looking at is doing all the ETL work in Tableau prep. This will save me rewriting loads of old SQL. All the data comes from SQL Server (2016 if it matters). So the plan would be to create a few views in SQL server to make the job easier, then connect Prep to that and do all the data cleanup, joins and pivots in prep. I've watched a few videos and the interface looks great, and I'm sure it's capable of doing what I need. My question is about how well it will actually run. I'd probably need to create about 4 or 5 views and bring in another 2 or 3 tables from just one database in SQL server. Tables/views would all be about 7 or 8 columns, and no more than a million rows per table. It's possible I'll create one or two smaller reference tables (or just excel sheets) which I might include in the model. I like that I can just send this straight into Tableau for publishing or pull out a CSV for further analysis. 

&amp;#x200B;

My only worry is that, when reading a bit about this online, some reviewers have mentioned that Prep can be unusably slow when dealing with anything more than example data sets. My situation would be that it would be running on a virtual server with decent but not unlimited memory resources. Tableau would be the only programm running on that server (the database is remote). Does anyone have any experience with Prep and could comment on whether this would be ok?

The problem to me sounds like we have lots (probably billions of records) of contract/valuation data, but we're not doing enough (or any?) analysis on that data, so we could be missing potential patterns or signs, etc.

I've been tasked with gathering some insights from this data. The machine learning software I've been directed towards using for this is TensorFlow. Am I right in thinking that the next steps I should take are:

1. Identify the proper unsupervised (since I dont know the outcome we want to find) ML algorithm to use. Should be able to work with millions of records
2. Find the ""module"" in TensorFlow that can run this algorithm on lots of data
3. Acquire copies of the data, run the TensorFlow ML model on the data
4. Get results, then try to analyze them

&amp;#x200B;

Does that sound about right? I will be checking in with the superiors who assigned this as well, to make sure I have the right idea from their point of view.

Are there any well-known resources I can look into to help with this? While I did study math in college, my professional background has been in software development, not data science, so I feel very new in this space.

The discrete parameters I change are ""Surface"" (3 possibilities), ""Cleaning"" (3 possibilities), ""Plasma"" (2 possibilities), ""Location"" (2 possibilities), ""Buffer"" (6 possibilities), ""pH"" (2 possibilities), ""Thiol"" (2 possibilities), ""Concentration"" (4 possibilities) and ""Volume"" (2 possibilities). These are all independent variables. Most are discrete, except for concentration (50, 25, 12, and 0) and volume (single or double). For example, for 12, I would expect half the signal of 25.

This yields thousands of data points. The results table looks as follows (first 5 lines):

    Surface Cleaning Plasma Location Buffer  pH  Thiol Concentration Volume Signal
    Sulfo   Classic  Yes    bottom   BufferA 8,0 oxi   50            2      26546

Now, how would you recommend to get started to identify the optimal parameter combinations which result in a high measured ""Signal"" (the dependent variable)? Since signal can be any number between 0 and 65536, I consider it continuous. Therefore, I think this is a regression approach and not a classification or clustering approach.

Work experience- employers prize work experience over so many things. You obviously need to be very thorough in your machine learning and data science concepts but even getting the equivalent of two years work experience through co-ops while in school goes a long way. Employers notice your application over other candidates and who know they might give you a salary bump because of the work experience. 

Also working in the real world is so different than school that it gives you a trial and error chance to learn about various company cultures .

I am looking at some jobs and could use some career advice. My first and biggest decision coming up is whether I should graduate and look for jobs, or continue on to get my masters. To be honest, I do not really want to stay in school unless I have to, which hopefully you may be able to weigh in on.  


After working in a research lab for a year, and taking some design classes, I know that I do not want to go into research or RnD, or anything BME related for that matter. In hind sight, I wish I had majored in CS or data science, so I am trying to find a way to combine that interest without totally spoiling my BME degree. One option would be possibly a masters in CS or data science, but again I would like to avoid additional schooling if I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of the masters or not, I have focused my career interest on data science, and not necessarily biomedical related. I have been looking for any data science jobs in biomedical, but also venture capital, wealth management, software startups, marketing companies, consulting firms, etc. It is a pretty large field (as you all know) with a lot of companies hiring right now, which is part of why it interests me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been taking CS and data science courses as my engineering electives, but I am afraid I am going to lack knowledge and experience to enter the field. I will basically have CS object oriented programming, algorithms, and machine learning, with an intro to data science course (very little statistics knowledge), and a BME degree under my belt when I graduate. Sadly, I spent my summers working on a BME project as it was necessary to write a thesis. The project had some Python coding and deals with data capture, but very little data science.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that an internship would be a great chance to improve my skills and experience, but a lot of them require already having the machine learning and/or data science skills that I will not have until after completing my senior year. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr: I am a senior graduating with a Biomedical Engineering degree but I want to work in data science. I will have some basic course work in algorithms, machine learning, and data science. I am afraid this is not enough. How can I increase my skills/resume when I feel I do not qualify for most data science jobs/internships at the moment?

1) does school prestige/rankings matter for where I get my MSBA? Is looking at B-school rankings accurate?

2) Potential salary? Im aware that location matters, a ballpark range will be helpful. How do promotions/bonuses work? Jobs I am interested in: Data analyst, business analyst, business intelligent analyst, consulting

Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this post is just to get this anxiety off my chest. I just came back from my first DS position interview.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking on this sub for about 2 years now when I decided I wanted to take this career path and today, by accident, I ended up as a candidate for a serious DS position.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been rotting away on a data analyst ( called 'Data Specialist') position for 5 years now. What I mostly do is simple statistical analysis on headcount data in the company and monitor KPIs for business partners. I mostly use alteryx, excel, VBA and SQL (in Access).

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I was a little upset with my job so I sent out a couple of CVs and a bank called back. The position I applied to was called Business analyst and was asking for SQL and previous experience with data management. I went into the interview and told them about myself ( Advanced SQL, VBA, Alteryx, Office suite user and .net developer in my spare time). I was expecting a simple data analyst job (just as I have now - simple descriptive statistics and KPI motoring) but they are asking for serious predictive statistics skills and stat modelling (including for targeted advertising and customer behavior analysis - this is some Cambridge analytica s\*\*t).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been pretty good at statistics in uni (Masters in Psych here) so I could hold a conversation about different simple statistical tests they asked about but I acknowledged I haven't used any of that knowledge in 5 years since I graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

After the interview the manager expressed his concerns about my knowledge about statistics but he was pleasantly surprised about my self-taught programming skills and said he will think about my application and come back. I will have a stat test but he said it will be used just to asses the level they need to take me from and see what gaps in knowledge I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not expecting to get the job but if I do, I will have to deal with a serious impostor syndrome.

Just needed to take this off my chest. I am still shaking ( and I didn't even want to switch jobs in the first place).

My resume have 15 projects! I've linked it to my github static website which laid out my portfolio. Where do these projects come from? from the dataisbeautiful subreddit! I just basically tried to duplicate their work in my way and learn how to do it. Most of the time, the OPs that submitted their work won't try and give you the entire code but will work with you and help you out along the way. Sometime, they have the entire work in github and you can dissect it that way.   


My resume was just my skillsets, my education, and bunch of projects along with few paid projects thrown in from freelance webdev work.

&amp;#x200B;

my take away advice? 

Don't take online courses thinking you gonna be a data scientist! take the courses so that you can understand what you are doing! take it so that you wanna learn how to make an analytic dashboard. Learn it so you can see how to make word cloud from your friend's text messages in a whatsapp group text data of 300,000 text messages from 3 years of conversation.

edit: So, how long did it take me to get a job as a data analyst? It took me 5 months just to find a position at a company. In that time, I did freelancing as webdev for small local businesses. I learned basic web dev through angela yu on udemy. I figured I could make my own analytic dashboards and help small businesses and real estate realtors in my community on how to read data and use data to improve their businesses. It worked and I get paid for it!

I mean, I do basic web design landing pages for about $100 bucks. I did analytics and dashboard for local businesses using their Clover API and give them custom ipad app that uses their APIs to display the dashboard. I did this for $200 bucks. It's super cheap for businesses to give me work but in return, they get the app and I learned something interesting.

I did basic dashboard and nothing fancy. There are already tools out there on github that already does what you want to do. For example, making a reporting tool using a custom ipad dashboard using Clover REST API. I made that in Flutter rather than native iOS swift. So, hey, it's basic and it gets the job done. I've made landing pages for realtors. I've showed them how to do social media analytics. It's all basic stuff but I learned by doing something.

But the point is, you learn how to gather data and how to extract data. The dashboard thing? It took me 2 months to figure it out but I get paid $500 in flat fee. So, at least, that's on my resume!",22,33,False,self,,,,,

I've taken the GRE and got pretty competitive scores and have been looking at different options for possible Master's programs.

For the most part I've been looking at data analytics since that seems to fit with my background on database management.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my main question, which of the following options makes the most sense to take steps towards a career shift without adding unnecessary financial debt?

1. Just start applying to entry level jobs and spin my resume to their needs while just doing self education on SQL, python, etc.
2. Take a certification course online (I found one from Certs-School on sale for stupid cheap)
3. Take a certification course from a reputable school (e.g. Ohio State offers one I could complete in 1 school year) (est. cost \~$2600)
4. Recognize that getting a Masters is the only reasonable option and that getting $30k+ into debt can pay for itself eventually

I need to explain an important detail in my master thesis, but I don't know the correct term for the procedure, so I can't start googling for it. Maybe some of you have heard of this:

Assume I have a dataset which holds all countries of the world with attributes like ""population density"", ""average level of education"", ""percentage of impoverished population"", ""average age"" etc. Now I calculate the correlations between the different attributes, with the conclusion that e.g. countries with a less educated population tend to have a greater percentage of impoverished and so on. 

Now after doing that, the R function that I use (eclust), would calculate one value to describe the similarity between two countries. E.g. the similarity between Germany and France would be 0.80.
So to sum it up: I give datapoints to the function that have a bunch of attributes and it gives me back one single number that describes the similarity between those datapoints.

First of all, I tried to look for similar inquiries and whatnot in the sub (+ rules) before writing this, in my opinion (given also the level of detail I will provide) none do quite fit what I'm going to say, so here we are!

I write to you, fellow redditors, in the hope that you have some useful advice for me. For some context: I am a recently graduated Econ major with an interest in Data Science. For some specifics, I come from a quite decent program (top 10 in Europe), and have a normal-ish GPA of 3.1, roughly placing me in the 20% on the top, if that matters.

Although the major is econ, I have specialized in a track called Advanced Quantitative Methods where we cover some subjects like linear algebra and dynamic systems, stochastic processes, several econometrics and statistics courses, and so on. The end result is that I can handle STATA (already forgetting because I hate using it) and am fairly versatile with R. My end of bachelor's thesis is on using several covariance forecasting methods over a financial database that we constructed more or less from scratch, and got a good grade on it. I would say that the basics of the algebraic part, such as using PCA or SVD or stuff like that are quite familiar to me these days.

This is what I've got so far. No python, no knowledge about data modeling, though. What I want to do now is:

I've got a spare year in front of me, because reasons. Thanks to savings I am well enough to manage without working, so I can commit to a full year of studies. My objective is to get by 2020 to the best possible Msc in Data Science program in Europe. I have already mailed several institutions asking about elegibility given my background and got mixed answers depending on who was that replied. In most cases, I am welcome to apply but warned that usually they accept people coming from STEM backgrounds, so there's that.

I have a full year, and my intention is, by the end of it, to have an edge that allows me to first get in, and then also perform well in the Master itself. I want to do that by submitting a good GRE score along with my application (plan to commit 2 months on preparing it part time), learning some Python and maybe SQL, and generally brushing up on my math and stats, maybe getting into content from the Master itself. There are several ways in which I could do that, from bootcamp (too expensive so would rather avoid it if possible), to self-teaching. I am quite confident I could do some time as RA with my bachelor's thesis advisor, if need be.

Hi, Im helping to do an analysis to support the report.

I got the result from the main model using SEM model which takes Total sales as an independent variable. I got 10 dependent variables (x1 to x10) which have a direct effect on the Sales and their effective contribution to Sales respectively.

The analysis needs to do is separating Total sales into two categories sales, A Sales and B Sales. Which means Total Sales are the sum of A Sales and B Sales, where A Sales takes 60% of the total sales and B Sales takes 40%. I need to find the effective contribution of variables from the main model(x1 to x10) to these categories sales.

I tested two multiple regression by using both category sales as y respectively and all of the variable Xs, and calculated the standardized coefficient (beta) into percentage as the contribution.

However, my boss asked me the sum of the contribution from each dependent variable Xi to A and B sales should equal to their contribution to Total Sales.

Under below is the demo so far I have done:

The result of Total Sales is given and fixed.

How can I calculate the contribution of X1 to A Sales and B Sales equal to 50%?

So as other variables. 

Total Sales A Sales B Sales

x1 50 40 20

x2 10 20 25

x3 15 15 35

x4 20 10 20

x5 5 15 0

Contribution Sum % 100 100 100

I understand the dependent variables have different effect since the target y is different.

While my boss thinks it is not easy to explain and compare the contribution of different categories in this way.

Let's say that I have a model with 30 feature variables with a recall of 0.8. As a way of making little improvements, I have been testing new variables in the following way:

-Make a k-fold CrossValidation process with my new variable (now onwards X), so that I get k values of recall, stored in X_list.
-Drop the variable X and make a k-fold cross validation process, ending with another list of k recall values, called Y_list.
-Make a hypothesis test to compare recall of first sample (X_list) against second sample (Y_list).
-If the hypothesis test says that X_list have greater recall than Y_list, I take X as a useful feature and I keep it.

Is there any error in the reasoning of this part? Anything to improve? 

So, I keep X and I introduce the variable Z and make the same process. In the case that the test gives Z as useful, I also keep it. Let's imagine that I also introduce the variable W. Until now, I have been keeping both X,Z and W as new variables, but I have a doubt:

Having improvements with X,Z and W in the way I had them, means that that is the best combination of variables? Or maybe if I had tested W right after X, W or Z wouldn't have throw better results? Should I test every possible combination among those 3 variables or it is okay the way I am doing it?

Simply put, I recently graduated (BSc+MSc) in physics, but I just realized I want to start a career in DS. 

I started studying on my own, but I was also considering the option of enrolling in a program somewhere in Europe (as I am a EU citizen and from my comprehension the fees here are typically way lower). 

Ideally I am looking for a program like Information Studies: Data Science ([https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html)) at Amsterdam's University. The pros:

\- 1 year long (I don't really want a 2+ year long program)

\- affordable price for EU citizens (2k euros)

\- from a city/nation with a well-established tech market

The problem is that the enrollment deadline was 1 May, so I am way too late. Unfortunately I just made up my mind and only recently understood this is what I want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Topics include the primal and dual  simplex methods, network flow algorithms, branch and bound, interior  point methods, Newton and quasi-Newton methods, and heuristic methods.  Students will gain experience in formulating models and implementing  algorithms using MATLAB.

Topics include numerical  optimization in statistical inference \[expectation-maximization (EM)  algorithm, Fisher scoring, etc.\], random number generation, Monte Carlo  methods, randomization methods, jackknife methods, bootstrap methods,  tools for identification of structure in data, estimation of functions  (orthogonal polynomials, splines, etc.), and graphical methods.

Now I'm looking to get back into analytics (data science this time, obviously). I've now got about 3 - 4 months of Python under my belt and am working to figure out projects that I can build to demonstrate aptitude to employers. I was starting to attend meetups before quitting my travel job and moving to western Washington (state) last month, but I now live a bit far from most of the meetups currently available in the Seattle area.

Looking for advice/mentoring on the following:

1. *Would you seriously consider a bootcamp* (limited to online, 'on-campus', self-driven, etc.)? Disregard, if you can, the personal aspect of a potential (i.e. 'that depends on how driven you are'). The main benefit I find is the structure of the program, but I can't honestly say that's worth the $15,000 tuition rate. Bonus points to those who can advise from a similar situation.
2. Understanding that my econ courses, both undergrad and graduate, were fairly quantitative (calculus, linear algebra, other parametric math, econometrics: OLS, GLS, decision trees, logit &amp; probit models, etc.), and that I now, presumably, have a basic background in Python, *what topics, and in which order, would you suggest I pursue?*
3. Would you wait to being applying for DS jobs before gaining proficiency at a particular level? Or in other words, while studying data science tools/methods, *at what point is it worth applying for DS jobs, vs. dedicating my time to studying?* Let's be honest, a quality job application takes time to customize. This is the economist in me talking, if you couldn't tell.

I am done dealing with immature organizations that supply nothing in terms of structure and support (because they instead give you ""freedom"" to take initiative) and that hire inexpensive juniors (ie. smart people with potential and zero experience) to save money, when those people have never done a similar job before and just don't know how to make the right choices at first, which is natural. There is a lot of unnecessary waste of time, LOTS of confusion, just going in circles until expensive lessons are learned a year later.

I am a EE major currently in my final year of Undergraduate studies in a South East  Asian university.  I am planning on pursuing my Masters degree in Data Engineering somewhere in Europe(Preferably in Germany) and making a career out of it once I graduate. 
I would be obliged to have some questions answered I had in mind:

1. **What are chances of my getting into data engineering program considering I am a EE major?** I have been doing some beginner level projects in Data Visualization using Python. I have the projects uploaded on my GitHub. I must admit the projects are nothing fancy. These are some ideas I have simulated  and visualized using mainly Numpy, Matplotlib etc.

2.I have looked into getting some certified Data science program over at edX to enrich my profile. The data science course conducted in affiliation with Harvardx caught  my eye. My question to this, **How much weight do these certificates carry in evaluating my eligibilty for a program?** The course is a introduction into Data Science with modules on ** R basics, Probablilty, Visualization,Linear Regression,Inference Modeling, Wrangling, Productivity tools and a Capstone Project with a certificate for each of the modules(Total of 9 certificates)**.Here's the course if anybody is interested:
https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science


3. Getting certification for this course requires me to pay 49USD per course( total of 449USD for all of the modules). There is an option for completing the course for free without certification. 
**Is the steep course fee for  a broke college student worth it for the certification considering it is from Harvardx or am I better off doing the course for free and just develop my skill?** I would also add that I have 6-8 months of free time to do the course  before the winter intake starts in Germany.

My company does scientific/climate work for our clients and we have dozens of large datasets that span space, time, variable and scenario.  The best example of this is an ensemble of Global Climate Model output. One specific ensemble might be stored as 150 NetCDF files (~150MB apiece) that, when combined, have data representing:

* ...360x180 grid cells (1 degree latitude and longitude)
* ...monthly timesteps from 1950-2099
* ...25 atmospheric variables
* ...150+ model runs

In total we have ~50 datasets similar to the above, totaling 2-3TB in raw storage. This data is too large to load it all into memory at once, but not quite big enough to be a true ""Big Data"" problem.

**What platforms exist to store and manage all this data from a single point?**

The ideal platform would include:

 * Load in all our datasets while maintaining all their characteristics (dimensions, timesteps, variables, metadata)
 * Queryable in a reasonable amount of time (I want to be able to write a bit of consistent code to extract a subset of these data without having to write scripts that walk through file directories)
 * Accessible using either R or Python (Javascript if we absolutely have to)
 * Redundant (either stored through RAID or duplicated in the cloud in case of database corruption)
 * The ability to host it locally or in the cloud (or move it later)

Other wish list items include:

 * API to make it accessible to outside users eventually
 * Query is ""reasonably"" fast (pull down all data you need in ~10 seconds)
 * Map-based interface to query data
 * Pre-existing processes to import NetCDF files

Broadly speaking, there are two really large types of data science jobs out there:

1. What I call ""hardcore machine learning jobs"", i.e., jobs in which you are either working under the hood of machine learning models, or you are deploying them into production environments.
2. What I call ""applied data science jobs"", i.e., jobs in which you are using data science methods to solve business problems.

**If your goal is to work in jobs of the first type, your best bet is to get a graduate degree in computer science**. That is by no means the only way to get there, but that is going to be the best aligned degree to prepare you with the combination of programming, database, algorithmic, math and machine learning that you would need to work on that. (PS: don't @ me to tell me about how you became a Research Scientist at Google with a bachelor's degree in underwater basket weaving)

**If your goal is to work in jobs of the second type, then there are a lot of different types of programs that can get you there.** One general class of such programs are engineering graduate degrees. Why? Because engineering is literally the field that we as humanity created to solve real-world problems using math. 

Specifically, graduate programs in engineering tend to focus on how to apply more advanced mathematical methods to solve more complex problem within their given domains. So, while an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering may teach you the basics of how to determine the optimal duration of each cycle for the traffic lights at an intersection, a graduate degree in Civil Engineering may focus on developing models to predict how congestion will develop across the network representation of a city's traffic network. While an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering may teach you how to apply pre-determined standards for how to decide on what the tensile strength on a material needs to be on a standard shape like a washer or bolt, a graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering may focus on how to develop a model that best predicts the tensile strength of a component of arbitrary shape.

You get the point: Engineering = solve problems with math, Grad Engineering = solve hard problems with more complex math.

Now, because Engineering *applies* math, in general it borrows from a lot of other areas. There are obviously the core building blocks that they borrow from Math, Physics and Chemistry (e.g., Statics, Dynamics, Electricity, Magnetism, Thermodynamics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, Probability, Statistics, etc.), but in modern Engineering these fields have started borrowing from other ""derived"" fields such as Economics, Computer Science, Business, etc. 

So, for example, Transportation Engineering makes strong use of Network Analysis &amp; Optimization - which came of age in Computer Science - in their use of shortest path/network equilibrium concepts to predict traffic. Industrial Engineering makes use of Econometrics to create models that attempt to optimize responses to customer demand, etc.

The most noteworthy engineering discipline (as far as Data Science goes) is, in my opinion, Operations Research (aka Decision Science). Operations Research was Data Science before Data Science, i.e., it was the first effort by the academic community to use data and analytics to improve decision making. This field was born out of World World II when the British military started using data to make better strategic decisions.

This area has traditionally focused on three big building blocks:

1. Probability and Statistics - specifically with applications to forecasting and stochastic processes
2. Optimization - specifically with applications to finding the best option among a set of possible decisions (and therefore leaning on both mathematical programming, analytics methods and heuristics)
3. Domain expertise: OR has overwhelmingly focused on specific problems that have become ""classical"" OR problems (e.g., vehicle routing, inventory management, scheduling, etc.) which are 1-1 aligned with real world problems (overwhelmingly in the supply chain management world).

Machine learning (and therefore legit data science) have not been traditionally core to these programs, but as Data Science has become more popular, these programs have either incorporated such concepts into their curriculums and/or worked with other departments (like CS) to have their students take approved electives on those subjected.

That makes OR a very versatile degree that is very well suited to start a career is a more business-centric data science role. However, OR is not the only department in which you can achieve that - if you look at the professors and areas of research in each engineering discipline and sub-area of study, you will likely find people doing work in applying data science to their specific domains - and these can also be alternative courses of study *especially if you come from that undergraduate track*.

So, for example, if you did your undergrad in Chemical Engineering, you could look at what programs and professors are doing research in applications of Data Science to chemical engineering problems - and then get a MS in Chemical Engineering where your coursework and research are focused on Data Science. 

It's not the most direct track in that some hiring managers (i.e., non-technical managers) may not understand the relationship. But most technical hiring managers will.

Why is this important? Two reasons:

1. For those who come from an engineering undergraduate background, a graduate degree in their field of study may be a much less daunting transition than moving into a MS in CS, Stats, Math, etc.
2. Engineering programs are going to have much better brand equity than MS in DS programs - therefore, especially for more old-school hiring managers (read: people in their 40s), they may carry more/better weight than MSDS programs.
3. Engineering programs have a lot of research money at their disposal, which means that (especially at good programs), you have a really good shot at not only getting your education paid for, but also getting a stipend *and that is true even for international students*. Also, schools will often want to keep their undergrads as grad students, so you may have even more incentives from your school to stay as a grad student if you were a really good student in undergrad.

Hi I'm currently doing electrical engineering and want to pick up a second major. my plan is to have data science as a career to fall on. What sounds better/what should I take.

Both the math and data science courses take all the statistics units, where we learn how to use matlab, r and spss.

The math unit has a unit on harder differential equations and numerical methods (partial differential equations which I e heard is useful in data science) also the math degree has a unit on optimisation and networks where we learn about dynamic programming and such. For some reason data science doesn't take this.

The data science unit has a unit on multivariate statistics and machine learning/ data visualisation which the math doesn't have?

As an engineer I will take all the calculus courses.

Both require you to pay only if you get a job, which is good.  However, I have decent theoretical foundation due to self-study and I want some really strong projects and help with interviews.

What can you guys tell me about a career in data. I was at a safety conference back in April and ""big data"" was a big buzzword in many of the proceedings.

Since then I procurred a 3 months  trial to datacamp and I have been (leisurely) working through the python modules. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the computational coding I did in my chemical engineering undergraduate and I am drawn to the idea of a career that could be independent of a lab, refinery or other processing facility. 

I feel like a broken record because I am 25 and I still have no idea what I want to do in life.

Can you guys give me a run down of your day to day, your thoughts on how to acquire the skillet to be employed in data, and your overall satisfaction in your career?",2,4,False,self,,,,,

I'm jumping head first into learning machine learning by trying to solve an actual problem at work. I'm trying to find individual weights of items/options that make up the total weights of assemblies/machines. Unfortunately, the weights of our machines are not calculated by rolling up actual  weights of options beneath them. It is too tedious and time consuming to physically weigh all items and options. So far, I've organized my data into 2 matrices and applying SGD, hoping to extract the ""weights"" of the trained features as the weights of the options. I now know that this approach is wrong and won't tell me much. The ""weight"" of an option is actually now important/often it is used in a machine, and the model does not inherently know how much heavier an option should be compared to another. My matrices are set up as:

X = [# of total unit weights data X # of options] marked with 1's and 0's noting which options make up the unit in the row

Y = [# of actual unit weights X 1]

Now my questions are:
- can I continue down this approach and modify it somehow to get my answer?
- is there another algorithm that is better suited for this problem?
- can this even be solved using machine learning?

Thank you!

Edit: option weights are estimated and those are the weights used to roll up to give the theoretical unit weights. Actual unit weights have been gathered as they rolled off the line.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

We've been orchestrating a variety of A/B tests using randomly selected control customers to obtain valid closed-loop measurements of the effectiveness of various types of marketing. One of our repeated findings is that lifts we estimate using true randomized experiments are many times smaller than estimates we obtain on the same data by applying a variety of models to the test group that attempt to account for baseline customer attributes and exposure to other marketing interventions. The results from the experiment vs. the observational analysis of the test group in that experiment *are sometimes not even in the same direction* (such as situations where we offer a rich discount that ends up heavily cannibalizing sales that were going to happen without it).

This isn't an issue of small or limited data: our experiments involve tens of millions of customers with rich data on prior purchases and owned-channel marketing exposure. This isn't a case where our model families are too inflexible: we're often using non-linear approaches and ensembles. This isn't a case where we're forgetting to cross-validate: models we fit to, say, 80% of the test group customers actually work reasonably well from a predictive standpoint on the remaining 20% of the test group customers.

The problem is these models are predicting a large increase in spend for customers who are exposed to the marketing compared to those who are not, *but that exposure is highly self-selected in a way we can't entirely model around.* The underlying customer event data collected reflects ""activity bias"" in customer behavior that renders it unusable on its own for attribution. My team is far from the only one to observe this discrepancy in conclusions about the return on marketing from using RCT approaches vs. observational methods: see [this paper from researchers at the Kellogg School and Facebook](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/gordon_b/files/fb_comparison.pdf), or [this paper from 2011 from Yahoo Research](http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2011/proceedings/p157.pdf). 

We're left with giant unfixable issues in using data on exposed vs. unexposed customers in trying to attribute the lift *for even a single campaign*. With this experience, I'm struggling to believe any of the claims made by companies who sell ""multi channel attribution"" or ""multi touch attribution"" data science solutions. Multi touch attribution takes all the same observational data on which customers are exposed to which marketing touches and then tries to quantify the lift from each touch using some opaque mlange of Hidden Markov Models and various machine learning approaches. (Here is [an explanation from Neustar, a popular media analytics vendor](https://www.home.neustar/resources/whitepapers/understand-multi-channel-attribution-models).) My CMO has been asking our data science organization to stand up multi touch attribution models to inform how we allocate our marketing budget, but to me, this all seems like a hopeless garbage-in-garbage-out waste of effort: taking as input what has been shown to yield not-even-directionally accurate results for a single campaign, and compounding it by scaling it across thousands of campaigns.

To master Machine Learning (ML) one has to be good at maths, programming and domain knowledge. Domain knowledge (Eg: how to deal with images, audio, financial time series etc) changes from one class of problem to another, so let us focus on the first two

**First things first - the prerequisites:**

* *Basic calculus*. In Machine Learning, youd be working on a lot of optimizations that require knowledge of Calculus. It would be highly recommended that you are aware of functions, limits, differentiation, maxima, minima, etc.
* *Linear Algebra*. When you talk about ML, you will be dealing with matrices and vectors every day. So, knowledge of Linear Algebra is a must. However, youd also be required to know about other important topics like Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.
* *Probability*. Most ML algorithms try to model the underlying phenomena that generated the observed data. All of this modelling is probabilistic. It is therefore highly recommended that you are comfortable with the theory of Probability.

**Why Maths?**: we need maths to understand the machine learning algorithms/ models or to implement new ones. There are a large number of models which are already built. Even when we are using existing models we need to understand the internal working of the algorithm so that we can **tune the hyperparameters**. A single model may not give the best results for all the problems (no free lunch). Which model to use for the given problem is very important and to **choose the right model**, one needs to understand the internal working/ maths.

Thankfully you dont need all the maths but only some subbranches:

**Linear algebra**

**Probability theory**

**Optimization**

**Calculus**

**Information theory and decision theory (good to know)**

**Why Programming?** Programming is needed to use ML models (or build a new one), get the data from various sources, clean the data, choose the right features and to validate if the model has learned correctly. Thankfully you dont have to be an expert programmer. Some programming languages are preferred for doing ML than others

*We* hope that by being able to understand the following aspects, youll be able to sail through them efficiently and make your path toward a data science career a little bit easier. Lets dive in.

#### 1- Make sure you truly want to learn data science

&amp;#x200B;

*Undoubtedly*, data science is one of the most promising career options available right now. The salaries are excellent, you get to work on interesting things, and overall a covetous job to a lot of people. Unfortunately, even if youre passionate about stepping into the field and want **to learn data science** desperately, you may not be in love with the process. Put simply, if you dont like the day-to-day tasks that are integral parts of data science professionals job, itll be extremely difficult to maintain the motivation. Its important to understand that for most people trying **to learn data science**, it sometimes takes months before they get to work on full-scale data science projects. And after spending a couple of months in your effort **to learn data science** if you realize that you dont like the process, it can be a huge personal blow. While data science is an excellent profession, theres definitely a significant amount of frustrations which come with it. So, do your research before you start **to learn data science**. Try to learn about the tools and tasks a data science professional does, before you actually decide to build a career in data science.

#### 2- Select the appropriate role

&amp;#x200B;

*This* is another key aspect that has to be considered before you start **to learn data science**. In the data science industry, different types of roles are available  from a data scientist and a machine learning expert to a data engineer to a data visualization expert, and many more. Depending on your preferences, educational background, and work experience, aiming at one role would be relatively easier than another one. For instance, if youve work experience as a software developer, it wouldnt be much difficult for you to become a data engineer. So, before you start **to learn data science**, its important to be clear about what role you want to get into in order to be able to shortlist the skills to hone. If youre not clear about the differences between different roles, therere ways to find them out. These include talking to people working in the industry, seeking mentorship from people, choosing the role which suits your field of study etc. However, its important not to just blindly jump on to a role. First you should clearly understand what it requires and then prepare for it.

#### 3- Where to learn data science

&amp;#x200B;

*Now* that youve decided on the role, the next step is deciding on where you should learn the required skills from. Because of the huge demand for data science, therere lots of avenues available these days, from which youd need to take your pick. Finding material **to learn data science** isnt difficult but from where you learn can make a huge difference. Lets have a look at the most popular avenues so that you can make an informed decision.

* MOOC: With more students enrolling to boost their knowledge, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are experiencing huge popularity. They offer self-paced courses, usually free to avail, in a huge list of subjects and topics. If you want **to learn data science** through a MOOC, you can dedicate a couple of hours daily and advance whenever you can.
* Books: This old school method can be your best resource **to learn data science** if you pick wisely. Therere lots or resources available in textbook format from where youd need to take your pick in accordance with your requirements.

Despite all the advantages, self-learning methods like the above ones arent the best for everyone. Here, its quite easy to get demotivated as its actually difficult **to learn data science**. Itll take a lot of energy, a lot of work, and a huge amount of time from you. If you want to gain real data science knowledge, learning in a true-to-life data environment is immensely crucial. Lets check out another avenue **to learn data science**.

* Bootcamp: Bootcamps are the most useful and popular avenue when it comes **to learn data science**. They offer several professionally designed modules that help you learn almost everything youd need to become a successful data science professional. Some people may question the depth with which their topics are covered, but the truth is they excel at offering a good introduction and standard level of expertise in all data-related subjects. More advanced levels are introduced when you complete the initial levels, so you shouldnt be worried. However, before enrolling with a bootcamp **to learn data science**, you need to make sure that the program curriculum is professionally effective, the bootcamp has a proven track record, it offers job assistance after successful completion of the program.

#### 4- Practical applications are absolutely important

&amp;#x200B;

*Regardless* of the avenue you choose **to learn data science**, you should always focus on practical applications instead of theory only. While undergoing training and courses, its essential to try to explore the real-life applications of the things youre learning. This would not only help you understand the concepts but also help you get a deeper sense of how those would be applied on real-life. Just be prepared to follow these things meticulously.

* Make sure you do every assignment and exercise to understand the applications.
* If you get stuck somewhere, consider looking at the solutions by people whove worked in the field. Itd help you understand the right approach.
* Try to apply your learning on a couple of open datasets. Even if you dont understand the core concepts initially, youd get an idea of the assumptions that would help you greatly at the later stages.

#### 5- Join a community

&amp;#x200B;

*Now* that youve started **to learn data science**, its important to join a community of aspiring data science professionals. Taking up something new, especially a difficult field like data science, often feel like a bit uphill task when you do it alone, but when youve like-minded people alongside you, the task becomes a bit easier. Either you can have a group of aspiring data science professionals you can interact with physically, or you can have an online group that has people who are planning/have started **to learn data science**.

#### 6- Work on to develop soft skills

&amp;#x200B;

*Though* some people think that soft skills arent that much important for someone stepping into a highly technical field like data science, in reality, these skills are equally important like hard skills. Soft skills that most of the employers like to see in the applicants include leadership, time management, communication, and collaboration. Soft skills will become highly important when youll be working in the field, and thus, its important that you focus on improving it at the same time when you start **to learn data science**.

### Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

*Finally,* you should understand that a good professional is learning always and it has become even more important in todays dynamic world. Regardless of the avenue you choose **to learn data science** or the position youll be working at, youve to keep on learning in order to stay up to date and to grow as a professional.

I am branching this out to two other reddit forums (I need ALL the help I can get), so if you see this again, I do apologize.  First off, I am working for an international company outside of the US.  First off, let me just say that I hate what I do.  I am only here to save a bit of money and be with my mom who WAS sick but now is better.  To add onto my depression, stricter labor laws have been put in place,  and with the constant fear of being replaced by a local, I have decided to make my own plan and arrangements to leave and move back to the US by the end of May-June of next year.  Now, considering that I am not happy with my current career choice, I am opting for a change.  I am basically nothing, a consultant's assistant.  This is not something I would like to pursue even if I move back to the US.  So, I have been thinking a lot about what other options are there for me.  A colleague of mine has advised me to look into Data Science.  This piqued my interest .  I did my research and studied about how highly demanded this field is,  its potential growth, etc.  I have made up my mind finally and decided that I want to get into the field of Data Science.  However, this is where I need help in.  I do not have any sort of background in Data Science.  I have an Associate's Degree in Multimedia and a Bachelors in Business.  Currently, since the skills I have obtained through my current company can basically give me an Admin position (which I do not want), I have decided to take it upon myself and look at job listings and see what kind of programming languages they need.  So, I have currently purchased a couple of trainings from Udemy for Python to help me get started.  I will be learning R next.  I was hoping to obtain enough knowledge of some of the Data Science languages that I could put them down on my resume and apply for entry level jobs.  Please advise if this is a good way to go.  Should I focus on other things as well.  I understand that some companies may have an issue that I have no education background for Data Science, however, I am hoping that once I get hired into a company that I can complete my masters (I was looking to University of Michigan since they do both online and on-campus classes  (hybrid)) and it will be in the same state that I am planning to move to.  But basically I am doing this to get my foot into the door.  Please can any of you provide me with any sort of advice if I am not doing this right?  Or what other things that I should focus on or that I am missing.  I want to do this right.  I want to build a career in this and be successful.  I would really appreciate any sort of advice that any of you can give me.  Thank you everyone.  Especially for taking the time in reading this!",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I recently wanted group lasso regularised linear regression, and it was not available in scikit-learn. Therefore, I decided to create my own little implementation of it and I ended up becoming borderline obsessive on figuring out how to do it properly.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the github link: [https://github.com/yngvem/group-lasso](https://github.com/yngvem/group-lasso)

&amp;#x200B;

This my first publicly shared open-source project so I'd be delighted for any feedback you might have. Also, if you use it and have issues with it, please submit an issue on GitHub and I'll try and sort it out.

&amp;#x200B;

**Information about the package**

Group lasso is a regularisation algorithm used in statistics/machine learning/data science when you have several measurements from different sources and want only a few of the sources to be used in prediction. Also, this implementation is FAST. I am currently sitting on a moderately priced laptop and I can fit models with 10 000 000 rows and 500 columns without it struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

**User guide**

The package can easily be pip-installed by typing `pip install group-lasso`. After that it's as simple as creating a `GroupLasso` instance and calling the `GroupLasso.fit(X, y)` method. A full description is in the readme at GitHub.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future work**

I am currently working on implementing the same update scheme for logistic regression. I have currently done this for the one-class sigmoid based logistic regression, and it seems to work. The next step is implementing it for the multi-class softmax based logistic regression and testing it on some datasets. This all takes some time, since I need to derive some mathematical constants for the optimisation algorithm to work (Lipschitz bounds of the gradient to be specific).

&amp;#x200B;

There are other parts that I am working on as well. I should probably have support for Python 3.5, not just 3.6 and I think that should be fixable if I only remove the f-strings and the underscores in the numbers. I also hope to get Sphinx documentation up and running, but that will probably be for after the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Another facet for future work is support for sparse matrices. I don't think that should be too difficult, but I haven't worked much with them till now so I don't know how much of a problem that will be.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mathematical background**

Solving the group lasso problem involves solving an optimisation problem that in some senses are difficult (for the interested: it is non smooth, but luckily convex). Normally the group lasso problem is solved using an algorithm called block-coordinate descent, which can be slow. Therefore, I implemented the update scheme for a newer optimisation algorithm called FISTA.",10,24,False,self,,,,,

Ill caveat by saying that the program that Im in is not hardcore theoretical,  but more of application but still have a strong foundation of how the models work.

My concern is that as right now,  I want to get the best courses/topics/foundation/ teaching that will help me get a data science role.

About a year ago I decided to write a package to abstract away some common ETL tasks I had for a messy data format I frequently had to work with. Since a few other people I knew found it useful, I thought I'd try to generalise it to work with any complex data structures - and here's my attempt!

The interface is based on jQuery but with a more Pythonic slant to it, and it works on any data strucutres with nested dict-like and list-like interfaces. It also includes some parallel processing to help you crunch through big datasets quickly. The aim is basically to find the data you care about inside messy structures and then turn it into something that you can easily load into a DataFrame.

I've been writing Python for several years but this is the first time I've ever published a project into the wild. I feel like I've learned loads already just from going through the process of getting it out there and I hope I can learn even more by sharing it with other people. So please do try it and let me know how it works!

If you decide to **learn data science** just for the sake of landing a good job, you may lose steam midway unless you are passionate enough about the domain, have a clear idea of what you want to do, and a roadmap that would let you achieve your goals. If you love the wide variety of data that gets generated today and want to learn how it can help you take real-world, data-driven actions, data science is the field you should consider to get into. But before answering how long it would take you to **learn data science** to land a good job, its important to know where you are in your journey and what skills you need to acquire to meet your career goals.

You may often come across professionals working in the field of data science, who suggest a lot of different things and paths to take. Its true that you cant learn it all in a day or even within just a few months. But dont get overwhelmed when someone tells you that you need to learn it all  right from the fundamentals to programming, machine learning, statistics, database technologies, and several other domain-specific technologies. It all depends on how quick a learner you are, your background (like whether you have a Mathematics/Statistics background, or have worked in the IT industry), and the time and effort you are ready to put into learning and mastering data science.

So, before you decide to **learn data science,** lets delve deeper to check what the job titles are that you can aim to land once you have finished your course.

In the field of data science, three job profiles that are often touted as the big three are Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist. 

 

# Time required to learn data science for landing a good job

&amp;#x200B;

Heres a curriculum roadmap to **learn data science** and start your career in this field:

* Python Programming: Since this is a fundamental skill that you will need, get to know the syntax of Python. In your quest to **learn data science,** focus on understanding how you can run a python program in different ways.
* Linear Algebra and Statistics: When you decide to **learn data science,** this would be a precondition for data analysis and machine learning. If you already possess a solid understanding in these fields, you can spend just a week or two to brush up on the key concepts. Remember to emphasize especially on descriptive statistics because the ability to understand a data set is a skill thats extremely valuable. When your primary aim to **learn data science** is to get a good job, you surely need to get robust knowledge of linear algebra and statistics.
* Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib: You will need to learn ways to manipulate, load, and visualize data. In your road to **learn data science,** mastery of these libraries will be vital to the success of your personal projects.
* Machine Learning (ML): You will need to learn the theory and application of ML (machine learning) algorithms at first and then apply the concepts that you have learned to real-world data.
* Production Systems: after you **learn data science** and are job-ready, you will have to take on real-world data and convert it into action. To handle this task successfully and comfortably, you will need to be trained in ways of using a business computational resources to acquire, convert, and process data.

While undergraduate and masters courses in colleges and universities often taken 2-3 years to teach you all the above, many say you can learn them in about 6 months by dedicating around 6-7 hours every day. If you already know the fundamentals, you may even opt for bootcamps that will get you job-ready within just a few weeks.",7,0,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

 I am starting to look into going into a career in data science either via self-study or through a bootcamp.

 I left my job last month in order to make a career change since I was in a Software as a Service (SaaS) company as an Analyst doing proprietary ETL work, which this has been the majority of my career experience. I have done SQL development jobs as well, but most of my experience is from the SaaS world. The goal of this is to make myself more employable since I found out quickly in my job searches that a lot of companies want someone that can hit the ground running with the latest and greatest tools, and nothing that I did in my previous jobs were really applicable to many of the companies I was applying to or recruiters that I was trying to work with since a lot of them want things like Tableau, Hadoop, Spark, Informatica, etc.

 My background is I have a B.A. in Mathematics with a concentration in Probability and Statistics. I have taken courses over the last year at my local community college in Python and Java to build my programming skills.  I have also worked with XML, JavaScript, Business Objects, SQL, SAS, and Excel.

 I have been looking at data programs such as Coursera, Nanodegrees at Udacity, and bootcamps like Galvanize and Thinkful as a way to build up my skillset to make me more employable since I don't have a lot of applied data science in my background. 

 Preferably, I would like a lower cost option such as Coursera or Udacity since I really don't have $17K to toss at Galvanize, but if something like Galvanize is worth it, then I would be okay financing it. I've also considered doing a BioStats Master's at my local university, but I would really have to bone back up on my Probability Theory and Statistical Theory so I don't get railroaded. It would be a lower cost option since the Master's program offers TA and RA funding, but it is something for me to consider as well.

 I am wondering if there are folks out here who have done either self-study or a bootcamp to get into a data science career, how they studied if they did the self-study route, and if it was worth it either way.

I currently have a long commute so applied to jobs closer to home, and interviewed for a lead data scientist position. I received a phone call from HR saying that I am the preferred candidate, and I should receive a formal offer by email tomorrow, which was great news - it's a career progression and a shorter commute which will save time and money.

The reason why I'm looking for advice is that the job was listed as 50k salary, so slightly less than the 51.5k I currently make in my less-senior role. It will break even when taking the reduced transport cost into account, but it seems low compared to other lead roles. For example, Indeed lists average UK lead data science salary as 65k.

Of course, I chose to apply to the job knowing this, and jobs outside London inevitably pay less. However, the role will involve more responsibility and more stress, so I want to make sure I'm fairly compensated and not selling myself short. For context, the company is a multinational with 100k+ employees.

After reading some of the discussions and hearing about what other professionals do on a daily basis, I'm really looking for some help with figuring out how I can build on my skillset and add value to my position.

From what I've read on this sub, it seems like I'm the kind of person you guys would probably hate due to my lack of formal education in theoretical statistics, mathematics, computer science, and a lot of things honestly, but I'm trying to be better, so I'm asking for any help I can get.

###My background

I'm pretty young at 22 years old. I studied marketing and IT at a state university and had a full-time position managing Googe, Facebook, etc. PPC accounts for a relatively small (&lt;500 employees at HQ) business for the last two years of my education. I learned so much about marketing doing that, and I didn't know what I was doing at the time, but a lot of my day was spent curating data from different sources in Excel (I know this is cringe for this sub, but I was young, give me a break) and making high-level reports for team leads with visualizations and tables based on the data. They were always really impressed with this stuff and told me I should look into data analytics, so I started manipulating that data in MS Access - I had no idea what Access was actually at the time, I just knew it allowed me to process the volume of data I was dealing with and I could write SQL queries which helped a lot. Eventually, I was messing around with Tableau a lot, and I've developed some strengths around PPC marketing and data analytics (I think).

###What I've learned

* How to manage most major PPC channels on my own with successful results
* Basic proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python
* Fairly advanced proficiency in Excel (I can go into detail if needed, I know there's a lot to unpack with a statement like that)
* Basic knowledge of Tableau (I'm probably a bit rustier now)

Fast forward a few months - I'm now working for a large corporation as a consultant (gross, consultant, I know I'm striking out with you guys lol) with the title of ""Data Analyst.""

###Here's what that looks like

* Other people on my team manage our massive database(s?) and set up different apps in a program called QlikSense with limited views of the data. Usually, the data is tied to dealers (think car dealers), all transactional data from all manufacturers via UCC, and data specific to our marketing channels (Marketo, Google Analytics, etc.) - and all that stuff usually lives in its own app.
* I can edit the data load script for Qlik using very basic SQL and Qlik's syntax to change how the data is loaded into Qlik's API, but I'm not a SQL expert by any means at all. I usually search Google for what I need. I barely know what I'm doing.
* I use QlikSense to create visualizations with that data, which is fun for me, but there are definitely a lot of challenges that come along with it. The data can sometimes have a lot of missing records for an important field, and I'm almost never given context on the 20-30 tables I have access to per app. 

* Sometimes I have to create something called a Mashup in Qlik, which requires me to write a program in JavaScript that embeds QlikSense objects in a webpage on our company's intranet, which was super challenging for a guy who learned everything from freecodecamp and Stack Overflow

###Why I made this post

I feel like a complete idiot and a hack compared to a lot of the users on this sub from what I've read, and it feels really dishonest and inaccurate to call myself a ""data analyst"" at this point. I really enjoy making the high-level reports with visualizations and telling a story with the data I'm working with, but I can't do any of the stuff a lot of you guys are doing in R, Python, and SQL. What does that make me, except for a guy that makes pretty charts?

I guess the good news is that I find the challenge of this data science stuff to be really fun, but I don't know where to start. Help?",6,3,False,self,,,,,

For each sample, I plan to record the sound for 5 seconds, calculate the FFT for each 0.5 segment, and average across 5 seconds to cut down on the variance.

I have 100 samples, human labeled. Roughly half are ""good"" passing products. Half are defective products that fails the noise evaluation. Once I have the FFT data, I'm plan to build a model for the ""good"" sound, and reject anything that falls outside of the good sound profile. I want the model to be conservative, it's okay to falsely reject a good product, but it's not okay to accept a bad one.

I'm thinking about using random forest and using the magnitude at each frequency bin as predictors. If you have a different approach I should consider, please advise.

Also, I want to know if I need to ""calibrate"" the FFT magnitudes or my microphone. I don't think I need to since I'm only comparing the relative differences between sounds, not trying to build a SPL meter.

TLDR: The correlation and trend between various cryptocurrencies are evaluated to understand:

* **Which coins can help diversify your portfolio**: There is generally a strong correlation between coins, hence it is difficult to diversify risk (Just buying and holding Bitcoin is a safe bet).
* **Are stable coins actually stable**: Generally they appear to be decoupled from altcoin price fluctuations.
* **If it is possible to predict the next bull run**: Speculative at best. Nevertheless, end of 2019 looks similar to 2015, 2016 and 2017  get ready to fill your bags.

It's a SQL database with native Git semantics. We think it's the best format to collaborate on data. You can find out more at [https://www.dolthub.com](https://www.dolthub.com). We're in private Beta. We're looking for data science use cases to build against.

Whereas the fundamental unit of operation in Git is a file, the fundamental unit of operation in Dolt is a Table Row. This allows for cell-based instead of line-based diff. Cell-based diff allows for data-oriented merge conflict detection. If two people write to two different cells in the same row, no merge conflict is produced. Multiple versions of the same data can exist on different branches so data can progress at different paces depending on the user.

We also built DoltHub, a place on the internet to store and share Dolt repositories. We hope that DoltHub becomes a place for people to get access to open, maintained datasets to build data projects, products, and businesses. Once we get Dolt to the place we want it, we will start shifting our focus to adding interesting, maintained datasets to DoltHub, distributed as Dolt repositories.

We think Dolt and DoltHub are particularly interesting to the Data Science community. By storing the history of the data, you never lose the data your model or forecast is trained off of. By being able to diff between two versions of data easily, you can make more informed hypotheses about why two different versions of a model behave. You can have multiple branches of a dataset that have noise applied to train or test your model. Again, diffing between branches is fast and easy so model explainability becomes easier. Data Science as a discipline requires access to high-quality, updated datasets. The more data available, the greater the value of the profession. DoltHub will add to the corpus of available data with commit history to be able to easily judge data quality and freshness.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

My goal is to show you that you can use deep learning and computer vision to assist radiologists in automatically diagnosing severe knee injuries from MRI exams.

To do this, we'll first explore the MRNet dataset provided by Stanford ML Group this first post. We'll then build a deep learning classification model in PyTorch in the next post and develop an interpretation pipeline in the last one.

By the end, you'll have an overview of a medical imaging application with different components that you can use elsewhere in similar situations / other use cases.

I'm currently facing a problem at work where I have to find the impact of events x (time stamps) into a semi-continuous time series variable y (e.g. daily ticket purchases for a bus company). After quite a bit of research I've found a few interesting topics:

* Intervention Analysis / Interrupted Time Series
    * This is just basically creating a time series prediction model and comparing the actual values with the predicted values from your model after the timestamp. And then look at the cumulative difference, mean change, etc. More on that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuo8SwA1HO8)
* Point Process Modelling
    * There's a lot of papers and presentation of those papers I've found, and I can't seem to grasp the idea behind it or even how to incorporate those solutions into my own problem. I know that it uses some form of the Poisson distribution which tells whats the likelihood of k events happening inside a time unit.

Furthermore, I also want to create a solution, which I've come up myself, where I compare y values on certain time lags after the event and before the event, therefore analyzing the differences and creating a so called ""time stamp indicator"". Not sure if this makes sense though.

There's also this library called [tick](https://x-datainitiative.github.io/tick/) for point processes? I don't what to make of it, to be honest.

I have a concise idea on how to create a solution through intervention analysis and my proposed heuristic, but no idea how to do the more scientific Point Process Modelling or using tick for my data. Any advice/criticism on how to proceed is appreciated! :)",7,4,False,self,,,,,

Should I pursue Data Science/ML if I mostly enjoy coding and not maths?   


When I was starting to get into DS/ML, I was under the impression that knowing the maths, especially on a deep level, certainly helps, but is not mandatory, unless you work on research or improving algos, etc. Basically, you can do just fine with the basics (fundamentals of Linear Algebra, some stats, and some probability maybe) if you are just into applying the established algos to solve real-world problems. now, I am not so sure.  


I like the logical stimulation that coding provides (think solving problems on popular coding sites like Hackerrank and Leetcode), but not pondering over mathematical equations, and certainly not spending the day reading the latest research paper. When I did a small internship for a local startup, I liked the data wrangling, and the logical thinking aspect of feature engineering (wondering what features to use to come up with a solution to a problem, and getting that data ready to be used), but I really dislike complex calculus and stuff like that, and really don't want to spend my day beating myself up over complicated equations (I can deal with the basics, like I did Andrew ng's Ml course on Coursera).  


I would have to admit that the reason, at least one of the primary ones, for choosing this field over other programming sub-fields like software dev and web dev,  was not because I was fascinated with this field, but because of more practical reasons : good financial potential, future job security (there is really a talk about many fields like web dev dying out in the future decades, that scared me), less saturation compared to other sub-fields.  


Now, I am at a crossroad and not really sure which direction to go in. I need some perspective. Thank you for any kind of assistance.

1. Build exciting projects that distinguish you from your peers 
2. Write about your work on Medium and/or present it at industry Meetups or conferences 

How to build projects that make you stand out?  

1. Work with messy real-world data  one real-world project is worth 10 Kaggle competitions or analysis of popular datasets  
2. Focus on the why  ""why is your project valuable?"" 
3. Incorporate cloud technologies and big data tools  many newcomers dont have this valuable skillset, so demonstrating you do will help you stand out

It mentioned that algorithms like CART have a ""pruning"" stage to prevent overfitting. Essentially the algorithm creates a set of candidate trees, and uses some metric to determine the ""best"" tree of the candidates. My question is how this set of candidate trees is created. Is there one tree for each layer of the tree produced by the CART model (i.e. if the CART tree has n layers, then there will be n candidate trees -- the tree with just one layer, the tree with two layers, ... up to the tree with n layers), or is there a different way this set of candidates is created?

I work as a type of analyst in the insurance industry where most people are not accustomed to either language and are still on excel. I'm trying to convince my team (of analysts) to use these languages more as we do sometimes deal in quite large datasets so the cleaning data aspect would be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the statistical models we use are either GLMs or GBMs and right now we have propriety software which we can use to fit these  - however the software is fairly limited and is quite expensive so long term I would like to build the models also in r/Python.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm wondering is what is the recommended workflow if you know both? My experience with both thus far is that R is superior when it comes to actually building models, there are so many options to test the model and it is very intuitive to get the factors required out of the model. The GLM statsmodels module in python is fairly limited in my opinion so I am happy to use R for all the model needs.

&amp;#x200B;

The other aspect of the job is actually cleaning data and getting it in a model ready format. A lot of the time the data will come from various sources (random excel sheets, sql etc.) so using one of the languages seems appropriate. With python you have pandas which seems to be able to do pretty much everything we would ever need. However it is not as readable.

&amp;#x200B;

In R, you have the dplyr package, base R and data.table. Whilst it's good to have options I've been fairly overwhelmed with which one to use when I'm doing a simple data exercise. I've found myself googling how to do x in R and I end up sometimes getting results in data.table or in base R or in dplyr and the format of the whole script is inconsistent. How do you deal with these problems? Should I just stick to one of these packages (if so which?) or just go with whatever is best for the job at all times? Python however you know where you stand, it'll always be a solution in pandas.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm asking is I want to convince people in my team to use either language, and I preferably want them to use the languages in the best possible workflow and using a consistent package so that we can each peer review our work.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm potentially thinking: data cleaning, manipulating, initial analysis in Python using pandas -&gt; output as some sort of file that R can read, load into R and then analyse in R and build a model with in R. The fact that python can deal with web scraping slightly better than R is also appealing as it would be useful in my line of work.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons include that I don't know if majoring in both is actually a good thing because I am hearing multiple people on this subreddit that employers don't really care about your degree, they just want to know how much you *know.* I can instead devote into learning about advanced machine learning, because the things I learn for either of the two majors is not gonna be useful for DS.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dataset very similar to this of observed behaviors of forklift drivers in construction using cameras.  I'm trying to find the best way to analyze it. I'd like to be able to find any trends, patterns, etc to be able to present this data to management. This data was collected over 1 month to see if we can find out how safe/unsafe an area is. 

&amp;#x200B;

One individual watched all of these videos and marked the number of times they saw a specific behavior for a video. Some videos they had a total of 10 observations, other times 25, 5, etc. It was just dependent on what they saw and marked. The person had a list of 30 behaviors they could have marked down for. Each session was 1 hour long, but the camera split the sessions into two 30 minute videos.

&amp;#x200B;

Most methods I have looked into recommend using p charts or np charts but using those to present to management will be a bit difficult since they aren't familiar with those. I know I can use a Pareto Chart, but that only tells so much. They want to see if collecting this is worth it not, not just finding which behavior was the most observed since videos can have different number of total observations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on an NLP project and I want to see if BERT will improve results. But I'm having trouble getting understanding of how to go about doing this. I've read the paper, the README, the colab, and several disappointing Medium articles. I'm still confused.

1. Can I fine-tune BERT in Colab for free, or do I have to pay for cloud storage? I keep seeing things that say the TPUs are free, and then immediately afterwards it says you need cloud storage. If cloud storage is not required, how can I get the data into the TPU environment, and the results out of it?
2. Generally speaking, how do you integrate BERT into a project? Clone the repo into the project folder? \`import bert\`??? Do you just load the .ckpt? 
3. How do I adapt my data to make it suitable for BERT? I'm working on a multi-label classification task with inputs ranging from a few words to a paragraph.

My department has therefore decided that I should build (not sure why we can't buy or use cloud services) a computer to do some of the more beefier analysis. I typically look at either larger datasets (couple thousand samples and rows) or at smaller clinical data sets (couple hundred samples and rows).  I tend to really only use Python, R, and C++ when it's unavoidable. On my current work laptop, a typical longer analysis will generally take a couple of hours (leaving it on during the night), with an i7, 16gb RAM, and a 1060 GPU. For some of these projects, running the entire pipeline built takes roughly eight to ten hours.

My department intends for me to use GPUs for parallel computing for a few ML purposes, although I'm not sure the scale of our data requires multiple GPUs. Any advice on this would be extremely helpful. I am completely, and utterly lost, as I don't really mess with computers that much (I got into this through the math side of things).

On top of all that, I'd rather not blow my budget immediately as this computer is intended to last two years, and I'd like to save portions of the budget to upgrade. I am allocated around 3500 dollars for this project right now, and will receive another smaller amount some time later next semester for upgrades (\~1000 max).

So, what GPUs/CPUs/whatever else should I be aiming for? Is there any cloud based method that may be cheaper in the long run that involves less setup which I can try to convince my department to go for instead (already got turned down for AWS when I asked). As much as I appreciate the direction we are moving in, I really, really feel like I'll screw this up, and to be honest, I'd rather spend my time actually working or rounding in clinic than in staying after hours to build a computer.

My other options are Statistics or Applied Math, both which I dont find the most interesting themselves. I like to code and the stat and applied math major only has elementary coding as a part of its curriculum. 
Much of the Data Science curriculum overlaps with the Computer Science major so this is the closest thing to what I originally wanted.

However, I already got more than 15 rejections to entry-level positions and I'm starting to feel really demotivated, and I wanted to understand why, or even seek some help.

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of background:

\- I'm an European living in Brazil

\- I concluded my undergraduate studies at University of So Paulo in June (4 years total).

\- I worked as a data scientist intern for 1 year during my undergraduate studies

\- I spent almost 1 year doing research in Machine Learning with a well known Professor.

\- I took several rigorous classes in probability, statistics, computer science and artificial intelligence (besides the common STEM core courses)

\- I speak 4 languages

\- Good portfolio on GitHub

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to some competitive positions in Brazil so that I'm not unemployed, and I received a yes to every single one.  However, every application I send to Europe  starts with ""Unfortunately..."" and I'm rejected right away, I never been invited to a Skype call or anything like it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if it's because:

1. I don't have a master's degree
2. I currently don't live in Europe (even though I state explicitly that I can fly right away to Europe if I'm hired, and the company won't have to pay rellocation costs)
3. (what I fear most) Simply prejudice because my undergraduate degree is not from Europe
4. Any other reason I can't think of.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really starting to get depressed, because I'm leaving in Brazil in the next months, so I need to find a job to sustain myself, and also there's a lot of commentaries on internet saying that is easy to land a job in Germany...

The problem is that none of the devs have a data science background, or even a college-level statistics course.  I have a PhD in biology, but it was mostly bench science, before I made the (self-taught) transition to web development.  One of the other developers has started plugging our historic data into various price forecasting models (eg Prophet) and presenting the graphs at company meetings.  Each time, I try to point out that our data set is small and limited (\~10,000 transactions over 3 years, with each year having 2x the transactions of the previous), with lots of variables, and that none of us are able to explain how any of the models actually work.

From my experience in research science, I would never try to make seasonality forecasts based on, essentially, 1.5 years worth of data.

Linear Mixed-effects Models. We have Random effects and Fixed effects (hence mixed effects.) 

Toy example. I'm building a model to predict math tests scores throughout the year of 100 students, so I have the following model:

    Test_Score = Intercept + Study_Time + Hrs_of_sleep + Confidence + error

Test Score = The score the students got on the tests (Dependent Variable)

Intercept = Model Intercept

Study\_Time = How many hours did the student spend studying for the test

Hrs\_of\_sleep = How many hours of sleep did the student get the night before the test

Confidence = How confident is the student on how well he knows the material

Error = Error Term

&amp;#x200B;

So far, so good, except I'm taking multiple samples from each student, which violates the independence assumption of linear regression, so I add a random effect to the model and **Here is where I get confused.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Adding a random effect states that you now generate a unique intercept per student. Does this mean we remove the Intercept from above, hot encode the students, and generate a model?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if we build a mixed-effects model using only three students: Tina, Gene, and Luise. Does the model become

    Test_Score = Study_time + Hrs_of_Sleep + Confidence + IsGene + IsLuise + IsTina + Error

where IsGene, IsLuise, and IsTina is a 1/0 flag in the data for each student.

I started applying for jobs a month and a half ago and I now have two offers in hand. I don't have a very well-defined career goal apart from wanting to work as a data scientist or engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

Company A: data analyst at big marketing agency (big 4 for marketing).  In short, they need someone who can run metrics to see how well a marketing campaign is doing and use analytics to design the marketing campaign.  I don't like the glassdoor reviews though. All of them mention office politics and extremely long hours (which I hate to be honest). During the interviews, they mentioned they had around 8 people in the data team but that most people have left and they only have 3 now so they are trying to rebuild. I was told that I would need to work on a lot of different things depending on the needs of the company's clients which could include non-data stuff too.

&amp;#x200B;

Company B: data engineering internship for 3 months at a well-established startup fully backed/owned by a huge global bank.  The data engineering role is quite specific: data cleansing, data pipelines (ETL), graph databases, postgreSQL.  I had applied for a data analytics internship but they offered me data engineering even though the job listing has certain tools that I haven't used before (and they know it). The pay is 40% of Company A's salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards company B because it gave off a nicer vibe and because I'll be working directly under someone's supervision which is more reassuring since this is my first job in data. The only downside is that it's an internship so I might need to go through the very exhausting job application process again if Company B doesn't convert me to full time after internship. The salary difference isn't a huge factor. I want to make the best long-term decision.

[PyTorch for Deep Learning and Computer Vision](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/) by  [Rayan Slim](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-1), [Jad Slim](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-2), [Amer Sharaf](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-3), [Sarmad Tanveer](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/#instructor-4)

**Review** \- This is a very good course. Basic, but well taught and focused well on PyTorch. What I didn't like is that it lacks more advanced content. As such it feels a bit shallow when compared to the other courses. Not bad for beginners though, especially if you're looking to learn PyTorch.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught

\- Basics covered well, lots of time spent on Neural Nets and CNNs

\- Transfer Learning is well taught

\- Teaches PyTorch very well

**Cons**:

\- Only covers the basics and doesn't go into more advanced territory

\- Lacks cool projects

**Score - 4.2/5**

[Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/computer-vision-Ob1nR) \- by Andrew Ng

**Review** \- Excellent Course! I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into the complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.

\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!

\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics

**Cons**:

\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.

\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.

\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value.

**Score - 4.5/5**

**Review** \- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.

**Pros**:

\- Good variety of core content

\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)

\- Fun projects

**Cons**:

\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basics before moving onto a project.

\- Some fluff and overly long videos. A bit inconsistent in what's taught well and what's skimmed.

[Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) \-  Created by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/#instructor-1)

I enjoyed this course quite a bit. It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.

**Pros:**

\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well

\- All code works

\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value

\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow

**Cons:**

\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free

\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do

**Score 4.3/5**

[Deep Learning Computer Vision CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/?couponCode=REDDIT) \-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)

I loved this course! It was my go-to reference for doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like ""here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this"". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)

**Pros:**

\- Amazing and detailed content

\- Excellent theoretical explanations

\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things

\- Very fun projects!

\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV

\- New content always being added it seems!

**Cons:**

\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.

\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code

\- Some of the content is text, not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.

**Score 4.6/5**

[Computer Vision Intro OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/?couponCode=REDDIT) \-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)

This is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also, the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!

**Pros:**

\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought

\- All code works and explanations are on point!

\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff

\- Fun Projects

\- Enthusiast Lecturer

**Cons:**

\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)

\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides

**Score - 4.3/5**

&amp;#x200B;

[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/?couponCode=REDDITCV)  \- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)

**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized I might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taught really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.

I enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. It goes into good detail about implementing and building the CNN's he teaches. Overall, good course, just not as much wide content as some of the others but still good at what it does!

**Pros:**

\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well

\- If you like code-along courses this is for you

\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well

**Cons:**

\- He doesn't step outside a few things, but the things he teaches are taught very well too! So it's not a real con per se

\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time for me. I get why many people like it, but to me, it slows me down (could just be my impatience)

\- It lacks a wide variety of projects

**Score - 4.3/5**

**NOTE**: The lazyprogrammer has a second course that seems quite good on GANs and Variational Autoencoders

[Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python - Practitioner Bundle](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) \- Created by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/)

(**NOTE** Adrian provided a 10% Coupon:  **reddit**)

This is the mother load. Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!

The code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.

**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:**

\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online

\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher

\- All code is explained nicely

\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics

**Cons:**

\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course

\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)

\- Expensive!

**Score - 4.5/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text. And I don't know how I missed Andrew Ng's Coursera's course, but the theory explanations in that course are best out all so far (Rajeev and Adrian do an excellent job too).

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE**: I got around to reviewing Adrian's other bundles. I have a friend who purchased the ImageNet Bundle and he lent me the printed text (which has been updated since). But I don't have access to the videos. Here's a quick summary of the PyImage 3 Bundles

* STARTER BUNDLE - Very good value and an excellent resource. Covers all the basics in detail but doesn't get into more advanced and cooler areas of computer vision such as Object Detection and advanced CNNs.
* PRACTITIONER BUNDLE - Highly recommend you purchase this instead of the Starter Bundle. It's excellent and covers pretty much everything you'd need to know in Computer Vision Deep Learning
* ImageNet Bundle - It's excellent, but to me not really worth double the price of the Practitioner Bundle. It does have some nice projects and some advanced stuff. I was impressed nevertheless, but in terms of actual theory and knowledge, it's not much new content when compared to Practitioner Bundle.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I'll put it like this. For a $10 Udemy course, Rajeev's course will take you from beginner to a working professional. But to be an expert, you'll need Adrian's (of PyImage) course. Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.

Often the data sets contain much more data than we actually need to get good results, but we need to process all of it to be in line with our standard processes. Some data pipelines use down-sampling of data sets (i.e., only processing 10% of data) and do pretty well, but there is always the possibility that the results could change after you run the whole data sets. Recently, I had an idea from some web front-end work that I've also been doing. What if we could make the preliminary results from a pipeline available while it was still running, so that we would have a set of results to work with after only a small fraction of the data was processed, and which would gradually increase in quality as more of the data was processed (i.e., 90% certainty after we process 1% of the reads, and by the time we get to the halfway point it's 99.9% certainty, depending on the nature of each analysis run, etc). This would effectively speed up the pipeline by allowing users to access results before we've processed all the data, through use of some form of asynchronous dependency (i.e., variantsetX = async(pipeline,yadyada)), similar to what we do in Javascript (where we don't make the users wait for all the content in a page to load before they can see it).

Until the end of the last decade, the word data scientist hardly existed. However, new possibilities have opened up new frontiers owing to the huge volumes of data that keeps piling up. And, irrevocable changes in the way businesses are run have spawned loads of analysts and number crunchers to manage data and predict successful future strategies and outcomes.

Organizations are still falling over themselves trying to hire data experts who can harness the power of data to hasten the data-to-action process. Although not as many companies as should be are relying on data-driven decision making, by the turn of this decade, analytics will have taken over. Just ask early adopters such as[ Facebook](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/science/sd-me-ucsd-fundraising-20170320-story.html), Amazon, and LinkedIn.

### Who is a Data Scientist?

Heres an interesting definition of a data scientist on the web: A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

You can read two conflicting views in Larry Wassermans *Data Science: The End of Statistics?*and Andrew Gelmans *Statistics is the least important part of data science*.

It is far safer to say a data scientist wears many hats!

Data scientists typically uncover commercially valuable information hidden in tons of unstructured and structured data. They apply a formidable skillset of programming, statistics, math, business acumen, great communication, and some psychology on huge data sets to provide actionable insights.

These big data wranglers need to have contextual understanding and intuition to come up with magic. Identifying whether the data is meaningful requires an excellent blend of technical and business skills. And thats what aspiring data scientists should build on.

Before you organize, package, and deliver data, you need to know how.

### What skills do you need to become a consummate data scientist?

Looking at social scientist Drew Conways famous Data Science[ Venn diagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUI3MmOrk20), hacking skills, math and stats knowledge, and substantive expertise (commonly assumed to be domain knowledge) portray the interdisciplinary nature of a data scientists strengths.

https://i.redd.it/57gcc4mr9lc31.png

&amp;#x200B;

* A data scientist needs hacking skills to collect and munge e-data, math and stats knowledge to apply the right tools and techniques to glean key insights, and substantive expertise to ask motivating questions and make predictions. Conway says a major part of the data science cycle lies in hacking skills, which is focused on tools such as Python, R, and Hadoop.
* Modeling follows exploring data. This is where math and stat come into play. The trick lies in finding the most suitable technique to apply on big data to identify the least error-prone predictive model.
* The final step would involve a data scientist knowing how to interpret the results and ask interesting questions.

There is a[ series](http://www.prooffreader.com/2016/09/battle-of-data-science-venn-diagrams.html) of Venn diagrams modeled on Conways version.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2016 version by Gartner perhaps makes more sense with its specific call-outs.

In the video below, Jeff Hammerbacher, Cloudera Co-founder and a prominent data scientist, calls data scientists data rats. Hammerbacher, who coined the term data scientist, says there is no perfect background to becoming a data scientist. In practice, he believes there are five components you need to be trained on to do your job properly:

* Data collection and integration
* Data visualization (dashboard design)
* Large-scale experimentation
* Causal inference and observational studies
* Data products (fitting machine learning models, deploying in production, setting up a regular refresh cycle, and evaluating performance)

### How can you become a data scientist?

Watch this great[ webinar](https://youtu.be/ccCblUZFM0w) by Jesse Steinweg-Woods on How to become a data scientist in 2017 to get answers to some really specific questions.

**For the professional:**

If you want to switch to a career in data science, then[ taking](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/13-free-training-courses-on-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence) free MOOCs (Coursera, Udacity, EdX, Khan Academy) or enrolling for online classes could be your best bet. People from diverse backgrounds can find themselves doing really well in analytical jobs because of their amazing talent for problem-solving, curiosity, and communication skills.

**For the student:**

Universities[ world over](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/17-post-graduation-courses-machine-learning-data-science-us-india) offer graduate courses in data science, business intelligence, analytics, and big data technologies. For math, statistics, or computer science undergraduates, this could be a fantastic option. If you want to study on your own, thats fine too because there are lots of[ free e-books](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/13-free-self-study-books-mathematics-machine-learning-deep-learning) to help you master the skills you need.

Joining competitions, attending data science meet-ups, doing projects for experience, and updating your repertoire of skills will ensure that you are near-perfect for the job. It is really all about practice. And tons of it.

Before you go all out, you can get an internship or join a bootcamp with companies such as Amazon, Zipfian, and Twitter just to be sure that this is the right career choice for you.

### Why become a Data Scientist?

You dont need to be sold the idea. Really?

You love numbers. You love data. But truthfully, arent the big bucks and the job security great incentives?

Data scientists make about $130,000 a year on average. Since 2013, job postings for data scientists have grown by 108%. Research says that the career path for a data scientist is expected to touch almost 19% this decade. And, Glassdoor says that data science jobs have great average scores for work-life balance. Data scientists are critical assets for any organization today.

With studies saying that demand is expected to outpace supply and top companies all over looking for the brightest analysts, you can figure out the answer for yourself quite easily.

They are just text files, but they include a hard coded list of meeting participants. I used fuzzy string matching (python: fuzzy-wuzzy) to harmonize all the names within each file and avoid typos, etc. I now have xml files where I know who said what.

Now, I would like to harmonize the names and job titles across files, and I am not sure about what my best approach is. Some things to consider:

* Names are written differently throughout the dataset (e.g. Steve vs. Steven, AJ vs A.J.), etc.
* I have around 6k companies and 20k executives in total. Executives work for one company only in the dataset. For example. Bob Smith is CEO of ABC, which is different from Robert Smith who is CFO of CDE. If two people have the same name and work for the same company, 99% sure they are the same person.
* There are tons of variations of job titles, but only a few actual job titles (it's financial reporting meetings). So basically, I'd like to classify them into: CEO, CFO, Investor Relations, Others. Some people might have confusing titles, such as ""Asst. to the Chief Executive Officer"", which can make a fuzzy matching algorithm think that this is a CEO when it's not. 
* Some data might be missing in some records, but be available in others. For example. John Smith might have no job title in one transcript, but be referenced as ""CEO"" in all the other files. I'd like to keep my dataset as rich as possible and enrich it rather that remove data.

I think I have several options, and I am not sure which one to pick. The easiest one (and dumbest one) is to use brute force. I have done this before with some good results, but it's not perfect. I basically extract the last word of each name and consider it the last name. I combine it with the company identification code. Then, I look for ""CEO"" or ""Chief Executive Officer"" in the title, and make a list with that. Some issues with that method:

* If two people have the same last name and work for the same company, my method doesn't work. It's particularly problematic for family businesses.
* An assistant to the CEO will be identified as a CEO in my method, which messes up my data. 

Another option could be the following:

* Extract all names, titles, and company affiliations
* Within each company run a fuzzy matching algorithm to identify the different variations of names.
* Run a fuzzy matching algorithm independently on all job titles to identify CEOs, CFOs IRs and Others.
* Keep the cleaned up names and job titles.

I am not sure if this is a good approach. Something I am concerned with is keeping a data matching file, so that I can program a script to go harmonize the whole dataset once the names and job titles are cleaned. What do you think? I am open to different methods, especially if there is one that is published somewhere (I am an academic and this is for a paper.). Thanks!",0,1,False,self,,,,,

 Graph Theory, Discrete Mathematics and Optimization    

 Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial   intelligence     

 Micro-eonometrics, Causal Inference   and Time Series Econometrics

We work as analysts out of a MySQL environment that is updated daily by jobs running from Retail Data Warehouse.

Some of our views are extremely slow and painful to work with, but it's what we know. We work across 100s of millions of rows.

We are looking at MapR as a solution with Tableau. However, the team is not a huge fan of Apache Drill when we are so used to MySQL. A lot of our operational reporting comes out of Excel, where we have queries with date parameters (something that Apache Drill does not support to my knowledge). Even though we want to move to Tableau, we won't ever escape Excel, and I think losing this ease of use will be a huge impact to the team, and will hurt the change management piece.

We have been discussing what it would look like with Azure Cosmos DB. However I'm not sure what that would look like, or what 'best practice' is. We need something to manage our 'big data', but also offer an easy way to get operational reporting data, and the ability to deep dive into low level data for analysis.

My team are not IT experts, they are commercial analysts and accountants. SQL is not their passion, however they are willing to get their hands dirty when needed, but I don't want to push them too hard. I'm not sure what 'goes' with Azure's stack to make it easier for them?

The main benefits of bamboolib will be:

* you can **manipulate your pandas df via a user interface** within your Jupyter Notebook
* you get **immediate feedback** on all your data transformations
* you can **stop googling for pandas commands**
* you can **export the Python pandas code** of your manipulations

&amp;#x200B;

What is your opinion about the library?

I know both are important, but assuming you just want to be a decent data analyst, maybe not PhD level or anything, what skills are most important? I imagine some college-level familiarity with statistics, linear algebra, multivariable calculus would at least be important, but what else? How important are hardcore software engineering principles and a Leetcode-level strength with data structures and algorithms? 

Is it sufficient when first starting out to have a decent grasp of math (stats, linear algebra, calculus), and know the basics of programming in, say, Python, R, and MATLAB, and be able to do things like clean data, read files, etc. but maybe not be a coding whiz?

\*\* I apologize for the life story in advanced but if this does gain traction I want to answer most of the questions upfront. 

Long time lurker here and I've seen a few posts that somewhat describe what I'm planning but I figured that I would share with you guys my plan to hopefully get some feedback from people in the field.

My Background:

I recently graduated from collage (WIT, August 2018) with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics and currently work help desk at a medium sized financial firm in Boston (300 Employees, \~$100 Billion in AUM). I do some quasi DevOps stuff here and there (heavy emphasis on quasi. Basically some Power-Shell scripting, expanding Production sever drives, pushing developers SQL code) but for the most part my day consists of taking help desk tickets and setting up new hires every week. This job is HELL to me... mostly because it's far from stimulating and in a field that I have no interest in and have been stuck in for too long IMO (Highschool = Local Computer store, First Co-op = Helpdesk, second Co-op = Systems engineer). 

I want to transition to data engineering and then eventually machine learning but I know that it's a long road, hence why I would start with data engineering/science and then transition. 

This presents the conundrum, how do I transition from help desk to data science/engineering? 

In collage I took two machine learning classes and worked on three projects that are geared towards Machine learning but they are rather far apart in complexity.

1. (Language - R, Rstudio) During my junior year in collage I was taking a Machine learning class (Math focus, learned about Naive Bayes, Decision trees up to SVM, PCA) during that time I worked on a rather simple Reddit sentiment analysis bot. It's honestly nothing to write home about, I mostly leveraged functions from libraries and PRAW more than anything and its as vanilla as it gets.
2. (Language - Python 3.6) Second project was my Senior capstone project that I teamed up with a friend on. We decided that in 3 months we were going to try and write a Bitcoin trading bot based on Neural Networks, SVM's and Technical Analysis. Now there was a lot wrong with this project.....like a lot. In that my friend and I were ambitious but uninformed and thought that if we worked hard enough we could make anything happen having pretty much zero knowledge of the challenges that faced us. 
   1. Fast forward to the end of the semester I had created this SVM that did OK (\~3% over market) on up-trends but epic failed it's way into double digit negatives during a down trend. 
   2. My friend worked on an LSTM Neural Network that he barely understood and after enough poking, he got it to trade decently during down trends (Lost about \~8-10% during a 50% loss) but did poorly on up-trends. 
   3. Nothing impressive for results but god dam did I learn a lot! 
      1. We had to find data sets, parse them, understand how time series worked and try our best to create something from the ground up. We had very little guidance but scored well in the end for our presentation and ambitious goals.
      2. \## To me this was my first serious machine learning project. ##
3. (Language - Python for testing, MATLAB for final) After that I joined my professor for an independent study and worked on a research paper for an IEEE Competition. It was on Evolutionary Algorithms and we ended up getting accepted into the competition and as a result our paper will be published sometime in August when they release the proceedings. This is easily my most impressive feat in the world of development and Machine learning/AI but it leads into my bigger problem.

Aside from the previous projects I have very little development experience outside of the classroom. I have no professional development experience and it's been impossible to gain any traction in that field as all of my professional experience is in IT. My strongest programming language is Python but because I don't use it at all at my job, I feel myself loosing touch.

My Goal:

* I want to quit my job and give myself 2-3 months runway to take advantage of every online resource I can get my hands on to beef up my resume / practice coding and prove to employers that I can be a data scientist. 
* So far I want to master the following:
   *  Andrew NG's Machine learning courses (all of them) 
   * Kaggle courses/competitions 
   * HackerRank, etc. 
   * Take any projects that I end up doing for these courses and post them on my github. 

I am aiming for at least 6 hours a day for \~90 days or 540 hours working towards this goal. 

I have the background so I'm not starting from nothing and expect that I will blast through a lot of those courses within the first month giving me time to come up with a substantial project to use as my major achievement for this time off. My angle to employers is that I was frustrated with my lack of growth and took things into my own hands to further my career, but worry this can be misinterpreted many different ways.

&amp;#x200B;

As for Expenses:

I have close to 15K in savings and have budgeted out \~2.3K a month for all my expenses (Rent, car insurance, food, utilities and BS expenses like coffee or lunch out). 

If I take 3 months off of work given my burn rate that leaves me with \~8K left in savings. I also have about 5K in my 401K so if need be I could pull on that if it were an emergency but I am aware of the tax repercussions and know that it's only an option in a true emergency.

My Backup Plan:

If for some reason I can't find a job after 3 months of building my resume and web portfolio I will give in and apply for yet another IT job.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*  IS THIS A VIABLE ROUTE? 
* If you were hiring and saw a resume that described what I am planning to do would you be interested? My main goal here is to get my foot in the door, where ever that is.

 There is currently a big push at my company to measure the impact on sales for optimization and or marketing events for given categories. Essentially,  we want to measure the post event period (what occurred after we rolled out one of those two events) compared to the pre-period. Sounds simple enough right ? NOT. The business is falling into too many ""what about-isms"" about the way we propose to measure lift. You would think we would want to look at program and just look at the sales after the program versus right before the program. Wrong, they rightfully get irritated with seasonality that is involved since we are in a highly seasonal business. I want to provide more context on what we are currently trying to propose and I am hoping someone can offer me something entirely new and creative or just tell me im doing it right and tell the business to STFU and stop complaining. 

* **Pre-period versus post period** \- Simply do a weekly average of sales week-over-week for the number of weeks the program is live and then compare the average sales week-over-week in the pre period. For instance, if a program has been live for six weeks we compare the six week period its been live versus the previous six weeks before the start date of the program. Push back at the moment due to seasonality if a program is going to be live for 26 weeks. 
* **Forecast versus actual sales** \- Here we are forecasting using [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)  at usually a higher level of granularity of data than the given program and the assumption is that if the program is impactful enough it should effect the entire sub-class of products and thus gives us an idea of lift if the forecast said $200k in sales this week versus the actual sales being $230k. We can then start to do some averages as weeks go on. I am hopeful for this method because the Prophet model takes into account seasonality factors. 
* **Causal Impact/Counterfactual Analysis** \- [Causal impact](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/263637_c02e26f8546e49f09aef7eff090fbecf.html). To summarize this the whole idea is to measure impact of an event had the event never occurred in other words ""T*his model is then used to try and predict the counterfactual, i.e., how the response metric would have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had never occurred. ""* Using this method it provides a number that predicts your sales had we not done anything and then provides you with what actually occurred. The delta between these two numbers is our ""lift"" in sales. Still getting push back on this method because as they say ""so many other things could have affected this program that occurred in the business.""

Am I just providing shitty measurement solutions for these people or are they being stubborn about our proposed methods. 

Does anyone have any better suggestions than what I have already proposed? 

TLDR: Business people arent satisfied with my lift measurement proposals which are pre period versus post period, forecast versus actual sales at higher grain of data, and causal impact. Am I just dumb and not creative or are these people being difficult?",17,3,False,self,,,,,

I'm an intern at a relevant data analysis company, and am having a hard time adapting to the work assigned. I'll elaborate on my situation:

I'm going into my 4th year of the bachelor of commerce degree, from which I truly enjoyed manipulating data. I pursued an opportunity (internship) in data analysis, and was fortunate to earn an opportunity to learn by working for 4 months for the company I'm at today. Upon starting this internship, my technical knowledge was quite limited. I knew my basics and intermediates in excel, and could handle SAS just fine. The job itself dealt with SQL servers and Excel, so I believed it wouldn't be an issue since I could learn on the go. For the first month I struggled but battled through excel files to understand my colleagues' logic and work. Partially, I can argue I did fairly well with the first project I was given. It was assigned a small analysis on a market sector, so the challenge was more-so focused on slicing &amp; dicing, and presenting the data.

Now comes where I stalled for quite some time. The second project was much bigger, and much more complex. After a first glance, I felt demotivated due to its difficulty, however never gave up on the challenge itself. I knew at some point I would face a behemoth project and would need to power through it. I did have a template created by my boss from the previous year, so I was confident it wouldn't be a concern to update the sheet. Obtaining data was straight forward, but calculating the right numbers proved to be more frustrating than I ever expected it to be. The sheets on excel looked ridiculously puzzling, and plenty of the formulas used could've been spared if only my boss had used pivot tables or a simpler method to manipulate his data. He admitted himself that his methods were complicated and that he didn't ""think of whoever might work on the continuation of the project for the following year"". My boss has an intriguingly complex method of displaying his work, which has left confused about how to approach the data myself - given that I have no professional experience in data analysis. To make affairs even more challenging, the raw data set I was provided wasn't fully updated, meaning I had to use part of a quarter to compare results. This completely changed how I approached the data set, and ever since I haven't been able to progress. My numbers don't seem to make sense compared to one another and my colleagues have not been able to help me whatsoever. Every meeting I have with my boss regarding this matter turns into an objective-less conversation about matters that are adjacent to the project but not directly focused on resolving my issue.

After a month stuck on the same issue, I've grown quite tired of the situation I'm in. I feel demotivated and incapable of proceeding. Whenever I consider going back to the excel sheet I hesitate and would rather do anything but what's in front of me. I'm considering whether this is the right career path for me, or if the job itself is the problem.

I'd love to hear some advice from some of you as it can shed some light onto my thoughts.

Thank you.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been working in IT at a fairly large company for the past 2 years, almost 1 of which has been solely in data. I started here when I was finishing my bachelors in Information Systems. Now that I have about a year of experience and a bachelors under my belt I've been itching to work towards a more data science heavy position. It seems that no matter where I look, roles require 3+ years experience in data. Of course I could continue to grind at my current position until the three years are up but I feel that I might start to stagnate or that I have already started to stagnate. The pay is good which makes it hard to leave but I value learning and my ability to move around to new roles more than stability. I feel that I am challenged more in this way and grow more as a result. But unfortunately I fear that if I leave, it will be hard to find another role in data as I work towards a masters. How do I leave a ""good"" job and continue to stay relevant? Should I work on my own personal projects and work towards my masters until these three years are up?

Struggling Noob here. I have been asked to create a pls model on a dataset with 200 predictor variables and 1 response variable. I have only 16 observations. I know the n is small and predictors are high, but these are outside of my control.

I have made a model, with the code below, but I have little confidence it is right. I don't know how to properly test it. The summary says after 2 components, 95% is explained. 

My Questions: 

1. How do I see what variables are in those components.
2. How do I test the model [pls.fit](https://pls.fit) or determine the R\^2?
3. If anyone has strong knowledge here, I'd be happy to pay for a quick tutoring session. 

Thank you so much for any help.

The way we do that is, first we will download the data using Pytorch DataLoader  
 class and then we will use LeNet-5 architecture to build our model. Finally, we will train our model on GPU and evaluate it on the test data.

#### Note:

*This tutorial assumes that the reader has the basic knowledge of convolution neural networks and know the basics of Pytorch tensor operations with CUDA support.*

[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)  
is a dataset of[Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)s article imagesconsisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 2828 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.Fashion-MNIST  
intended to serve as a direct**drop-in replacement**for the original[MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits. According to the creators of Fashion-MNIST  
, here are some good reasons to replace MNIST dataset:

* **MNIST is too easy.**Convolutional nets can achieve 99.7% on MNIST.
* **MNIST is overused.**In[this April 2017 Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/852591106655043584), Google Brain research scientist and deep learning expert Ian Goodfellow calls for people to move away from MNIST.
* **MNIST cannot represent modern CV tasks**, as noted in[this April 2017 Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/852594987527045120), deep learning expert/Keras author Franois Chollet.

I've been interested in a career change as I'm tired of labench work as well as the daily grind feeling like I'm a factory worker pumping out data without finding relationships in it or extracting its true meaning.
I have limited to no computer science background but enjoyed stats in college. 
Dabbled a bit with python- so no coding. 
I enjoy finding the 'why' and discovering how things work in different ways. So I've explored data science.

However, the research proposal has taken a back seat due to work ... but what lingered with me throughout these months was ""*how the hell am I going to get that data!!!?*"". Although I wrote a ""*proposed approach*"" to do it,  was still unsure ... and was demotivated ...

It's only a few days ago I decided enough is enough with worrying! Just go and choose a language and try to get the data! And I got it! 

The challenges were:

1. No idea what language I needed to use - Python? R? Java?
2. No idea if the selected libraries from the selected language could even extract the data ... 
3. Worst comes to worst, may need to scrap the data (which not really an elegant approach for me)
4. If that doesn't work ... copy-paste thousands of data (it's a web data) ...

I know I didn't mention any specifics (and it was intentional) but am just overjoyed right now. The project may fall flat but anyway, it's a small win for me and wanna share it with the DS folks!

I have two thoughts:

1. It's encouraging to see a well thought out model repository sponsored by a tech leader. 

1. All the models I've seen are Dockerized with a simple API. Could be a great source for design patterns and boilerplate when packaging your own models. See [MAX Text Sentiment Classifier source code](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Text-Sentiment-Classifier) for an example.

1. I have some computer vision projects on the back burner that I haven't got around to. The [Object Detector model](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/all/max-object-detector/) looks like a great tool for me.

Basically we do everything, get data from sql database or sas, clean, explore, model, sell the model to the other areas and put in production.

Its a lot of work. And bureocracy in the organization doesnt help either.
