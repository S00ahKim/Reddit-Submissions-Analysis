Context details within.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/alyjr4/what_are_the_most_important_skills_and_concepts/,logicallyzany,1548997224,"First I should mention what Id like to do as a data scientist as it does not seem to be a well defined role. 

Im most interested in artificial intelligence especially as it related to natural language understanding, especially in the biological and medical domain (I did my undergrad in bio). Basically Id like to work on projects that extracts useful knowledge from any textual source (probably mostly journals) and extract the essence of the article as it relates to a given medical or biological question. 

I have the option of doing either a MSCS or an MSDS, but the curriculum of the MSDS does not appeal to me at this uni. The MSDS is composed of applied analysis courses and a couple of programming courses. My reasoning for choosing the MSCS is that I believe a deep understanding of how to compose a computer program effectively will be more beneficial than learning about applied analytics, especially as related to business. I can then use the electives to learn machine learning techniques NLP and can even add some data analysis courses if necessary. 

Do you think this is a good plan for this context? Specifically, what courses and concepts should I learn for this goal? For example, I know NLP will be vital and machine learning is mostly how NLP is done and statistics and linear algebra are the foundations of machine learning, but how fair do I need to dive into fields like statistics and linear algebra (e.g. concepts my courses should cover)? 

Lastly, there is a breadth requirement for the MSCS so I need to dive a little into one other area. It is a choice between theory and database systems. I can dive into things in theory like combinatorial optimization and parallel algorithms, or dive into some database courses with topics like distributed systems and intelligent information retrieval.

To start with a background description, I'm a college sophomore majoring in Computer Science (and in a week or so if things go well, adding in a Mathematics as a second major) in a university well-known for my perspective major(s). Computer Science and Mathematics classes that I've taken in college (including current ones) so far are Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Algorithms, Research in Computer Architecture; Series, Sequences, and Multivariable Calculus; Matrices/Matrix Calculations (Linear Algebra), Probability, Differential Equations with Linear Algebra, and two classes of Discrete Mathematics (one under the Computer Science department focusing more on graphs and another one under the Mathematics department for my second major in Mathematics focusing more on sets). Just last month or so, I have picked up a high interest in data science because I wanted to do something that relates to both Computer Science and Mathematics. Online, I took several courses in Data Camp through the Data Scientist with Python track, but I feel that learning through a textbook would be better for me, especially if I need something to reference to when I'm doing practical applications. I have a decent background in Python though not my strongest language (my strongest language is Java), but I also want to learn R as well, especially when it's the most common language in Data Science from what I heard. Given my background, what are some good books (reference books, textbooks) that y'all recommend for learning more about Data Science (probably leaning more towards beginner-intermediate level since I've had programming experience with Python, but not much with the ""real"" data science part and no experience with R whatsoever)?

I did a Masters in Data Science but have yet to apply to any data science positions. I am a bit afraid that I am not capable due to my struggles with coding. 

Its been a year since Ive done much data science. Basically took a year off from work. Now at a job thats not paying me as much as I could be making as a data scientist (had different expectations regarding bonuses than that which will likely manifest).

Anyway, I have been speaking with people who do data science, but would like to get some other opinions. 

Basically, how can I convince myself that I am capable of solving these problems? / And also how much engineering / coding is required in most data science positions?

Are there better and worse data science roles to get into as I am just starting out?

I have a 2nd interview at my dream company (company A) next week and have a few concerns. 

I just graduated with a BA in mathematics with a statistics concentration, and a minor in stat and operations research. I also ammended that with some extra coursework in data mining and machine learning. I have been actively pursuing an entry level data science position and I landed an internship at company B  (theyve been dragging their feet on getting it started for 3 months now) with the stipulation that I take some online classes (OOP java, data structures, algorithms) during the internship, and at the completion of those classes, theyd give me a job as a software develpoer where i could hone my coding skills for a year or two, then move to data science within the company. This is truly a great opprotunity as theyre a major company in the energy field  currently building a big data initiative from the ground up so it would be a very exciting time to be a part of that. 

Since company B has been dragging their feet on this internship, Ive been applying to data science positions and coincidentally landed a 2nd interview at company A (my dream company). I had applied to 2 positions at company A, Data scientist I (which i found and applied to), and Data Engineer I (via a reccomendation through a linkedin connection). My interview is for the data engineer position and being that I feel Ive geared my education for a data science role, Im not too familiar with the duties of a data engineer and where that may lead me. 

Im extremely passionate about what company A is doing with their data initiative (childrens healthcare) and would love to get my foot in the door there and be a part of that team. 

So my question is this: Would the internship, then a software developer role better equip me for a future in data science, or would the data engineer better equip me as a foundation for a future in data science? 

FYI: Im 39 and in the middle of a career change (if that has any bearing).

I frequently find myself challenged to provide our data science teams with the access that they demand in order to perform their development work.  In particular there is a desire, which i do understand, to allow data science teams to do their development and research work against production data (vs synthetic/sanitized content).  Traditionally the only environments in which production data can be accessed are production environments, and providing developers with anything beyond read-only access to that type of environment violates a vast array of standards and global regulatory requirements that we are obligated to uphold.

This creates an impasse for us and I'd like to find a way forward.  The one option that occurs to me is that we could potentially build an environment that effectively is a read-only/cloned production environment, but the objective of the environment is to generate data science pipelines as an output.  These pipelines would forbid any type of inscruitable content (such as trained models or large data sets) from being promoted to the production operating environment.  They would consist only of code and procedures that could be executed automatically or using manual procedures handed to operational personnel.

Not sure if that approach has any potential, or if there are other alternatives that I'm missing.  Would love to hear what folks are doing that are under the same level of external scrutiny.

Rather new to DS, but will start a Master of Statistics soon, and have been dabbling with R on the side, with plans to learn Python as well.   


I only have a general sense of what I want to study at this point, but I'm hoping to buy a machine that will provide ample processing power for years to come for personal studies, and give me the ability to have a play with deep learning.   
Currently I'm tossing up between the iMac vs Mac Mini (recently converted to mac after a series of faulty windows laptops and dealing with a nightmare retailer, so Mac is a must).  


Configurations I had in mind:  


**iMac**  
4.2GHz quad-core 7th-generation Intel Corei7 processor (TurboBoost up to 4.5GHz)

16GB of 2400MHz DDR4

512GB SSD

RadeonPro575 with 4GB of video memory

**Mac Mini**  
3.2GHz 6core eighth-generation Intel Corei7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz)

16GB of 2666MHz DDR4 memory

Intel UHD Graphics 630

512GB of SSD storage  


Price works out about the same as I'd need a monitor anyway if I get the mini, so I guess it really comes down to how the respective CPU and GPU's will perform, correct? Unless the RAM on the mini makes quite a large difference?  


So the main question is, for general DS in R &amp; Python, which machine would you recommend &amp; why?  


Note that the mini can have a Black Magic GPU added via thunderbolt, but I've seen some reviewers having issues with it working with certain programs so would love the computer to have a GPU just built in a ready to go, and that GPU is super expensive and non-upgradeable; but at the same time the mini has 6 cores with newer chips.

I recently graduated from University and started my first job regarding Data Systems (in various forms). As someone who is constantly striving for more, I'm not really satisfied with my job right now. That's the reason I decided to register at a scientific conference regarding digital economy.

For that, I need to prepare a 9-15 page long paper. I've chosen Business Intelligence for managing data and better decision making. I'll write about BI in general, Data Visualization, Information Design, companies that are data rich but not insights driven, etc.

The one part that I'm concerned about is the actual use of BI in a company environment. I plan on getting raw data from a company/companies and try to find interesting patterns for them (and include it into my paper). I live in a third world country so it will be a difficult task for me. For example, I could use a small source of data from one company and combine it with public accessible data or something like that.

I was wondering, does someone of you guys has a suggestion for me regarding this, or an example? I would deeply appreciate your feedback.

Thanks so much!!!",6,1,False,self,,,,,

The hospital I am working at is having an issue with HAPIs (Hospital Acquired Pressure Injuries // Pressure injuries patients get mostly from being bed bound or because of some bad equipment). It's an extra cost on the hospital and patients are staying longer than they otherwise would need to.

Anyways... Our chief has tasked a few of us with creating a model to better identify patients who are at risk of getting a HAPI and to share this information on a daily basis with staff nurses.

My background: 
-MPH in epidemiology 
-6 years experience in various data roles in public health and medical research. Ive touched many aspects of data in this time: entry, collection (design and field work), cleaning and manipulation, basic visualizations and analysis - mostly summary stats, linear regressions, time series. All done in SAS, because its what I learned in school and whats predominantly used in my field. Ive also managed aspects of data transfer, such as pulling/pushing to sFTP/AWS, and automating daily jobs by running SAS in batch mode. Ive also dabbled in Powershell to enhance my SAS code. 
-Right now I work in a job where my duties are heavy on data transfer, manipulation and mapping. 

I know its an unpopular opinion, but I actually really enjoy working with SAS. But I also recognize that only knowing SAS is limiting in the job market. Id like to open myself up to be able to work at more progressive companies, where SAS is certainly not the tool of choice. Im thinking that SQL and Python would be ideal tools to add to my skill set. 

Ive been browsing various data scientist type roles and Im having trouble figuring out what job function or role best fits my skills and interests. I know I dont have a heavy enough math/stats background to be a ML or analysis expert, nor is it really my top area of interest. I actually enjoy data cleaning and manipulation, and also things like database design, and data movement.

 Lets discuss a few major use cases in healthcare, where data science can be utilized to enhance patient experience.

**1. Patient engagement and satisfaction:**  
 The patient-centric industry can implement data science to keep patients  engaged in multiple aspects of healthcare. Access to relevant and  reliable data is significant to design an efficient patient engagement  practices. Data science can be applied over multiple healthcare data  sources to fetch information. In the present scenario of patients  increasing day by day, managing the data associated with them is a  challenge. Data science helps to deal and utilize such enormous data.  Clinics/hospitals can use this information to improve patient engagement  and satisfaction.

**2. Discovery of drugs and therapies:**  
 Data science techniques can be used to design clinical trials, predict  outcomes and understand the effectiveness, dosage and safety. During  drug creation, data science implementation to the available relevant  data can quicken up the process so that the drug is available in the  market sooner.  
 Likewise, mapping patients response to genetic information helps in  discovering new therapies that are effective based on patients  acceptance and cohorts. This results in highest likelihood of success.

**3. Patient data security:**  
 Healthcare organization tends to have potential cyber threats. Analytics  tools can be put to use in this use case. Monitoring patterns in data  in terms of access, shareability and usability can help in preventing  cyberattacks and ensures patient data security.

**4. Supply chain management:**   
 Healthcare industry can utilize data science to gain more actionable  insights and to improve efficiency. The patterns in the supply chain can  make manufactures proactive, reduce counterfeits. Observation of  available data can make organizations act data drivingly and manage  supply chain effectively based of availability, necessity and  reachability.

**5. Diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness:**  
 There is always a chance of misdiagnosis in conventional methods. But,  using data science along with Ai, and machine learning can significantly  reduce such cases. By scrutinizing patients historical data and  applying certain algorithms, results of diagnosis are much accurate and  allow scope for better treatment.

**6. Prevent patient health downturn:**  
 Wearables and implanted devices are in usage to monitor bodily  functions. The data collected from them can be used to create medication  and diet plans or suggestions to improve lifestyle to maintain health.  The insights derived from the collected data helps in prevention of  chronic illnesses and also in better decision making on ongoing  treatments.  
 Patients who are already at hospital are also prone to sudden attacks.  Data science can be used on the vital information, historic data,  symptoms and diagnosis can quicken up the treatment. This can also help  in staff being attentive for the emergencies to respond on time.

Lets wrap it up

Data science provides any business with the  right insights and information to advance. Its the same with  healthcare, it can improve efficiency, reduce costs and advance  operations and facilities.

Companies across the globe are trying to make the most out of data  science advancements. They are also successful in creating data-driven  ecosystems and obtaining valuable business insights through data  science, which yields tangible benefits. Standout technologies like the  Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and  Robotic Process Automation create a complex integrated network. This may  lead to a potential threat, cyber-attack.

#### Here comes the use of recent data  science application in cybersecurity. Wonder how data science could  improve cybersecurity? Lets see how big data and cybersecurity can be  linked.

Companies collect data from various available sources, analyze the  information using several Machine Learning tools and data analytics  techniques. The results that include trends and patterns provide  decision-makers with valuable and actionable insights.

Organizations can collect the data associated with network attacks,  like frequency, probability and time of the event occurrence. Such  information can be processed through data analytics to identify possible  cyber-attack. Such information gathered can be used to predict  potential cyber threats. Thus, data science saves organizations from  cyber-attacks.

## Secure Valuable Data : 

Every organization has its own confidential data to be protected,  arising a need for cybersecurity. Loss of information, either internal  data or the customer data is extremely dangerous ruining companies  reputation. By practicing several security measures organizations data  can be secured. Data science can be used in scrutinizing the most  targeted areas through algorithms and identifying the network most prone  to attacks.

## Hasten Time-Consuming Tasks : 

By using data science algorithms a few time-consuming tasks in  dealing with cybersecurity can be implemented faster. By processing the  data, observing the patterns and trends in data, and identifying the  possible source of abnormality it will reduce the need for manual effort  and quicken the process. Along with ML, data science can do much more  like alerting in case of new threat including internet-borne attacks.

## Threat Intelligence :

Data science application in cybersecurity can be used not only to  identify threat but can also be used in risk management. It provides  actionable insights in managing real-time attack detection. It helps  organizations to limit losses by suggesting preventive measures so that  the attack doesnt reoccur.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ebza9mw23qe21...*

#### Organizations should make the most out of Data Science techniques for advancements in Cyber Security. 

## Statistical Methodology :

Data Science can be correlated to cybersecurity in planning a  cyber-attack defense. By interpreting normalities through patterns in  data, identification of abnormality becomes easier and faster.  Organizations can process the available appropriate data through  algorithms to extract adequate outcomes. Decision-makers will then be  able to assess the effectiveness of the solution and will also succeed  in preventing possible cyber-threat.

## Predictive Analytics : 

The rate of cybercrimes has been increased over time. Organizations  have to process a diverse large amount of data to identify or predict  cyber threats.

The measures have to be correct every time, weighing things precisely to the gram etc. So much so that I have a hard time trusting new recipes and have to switch back to older ones I can trust.

So I was thinking, why isn't there a spread sheet of empirical findings in cooking, why is the effect of something (whipping cream or eggs for such and such time makes it X, using this amount of sugar makes it Y, leaving it on the other hand makes it Z.)

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda can draw similarities between the things I'm working on right now (Neural Networks) where you also have to empirically try out new things and observe the changes, in order to learn more about neural networks. Why not for cooking? I can see this to help with more individual recipes, based on your profile and taste.

The goal is to predict the ""Pure Premium"", which is the amount of the insurance claim divided by the exposure of the product (Value of the building in my case). The data is spread among multiple years with some years having higher losses than others.  A lot of the data I'm dealing with is categorical or discrete data such as Year Built, Number of Stories.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I've done so far:

&amp;#x200B;

**Data Workup:**

* Truncate the data to remove anything above the 85th percentile 
* Split Training/Testing by year so both sets include a ""bad"" year
* Binned discrete data so each category has equal amount of exposure
* Kept NULL data points as an additional ""Unknown"" category

**Models:**

* Poisson log-linked GLM
* Tweedie log-linked GLM (Using ""tweedie"" R package"")
* Poisson log-linked Elastic Net GLM (Using ""glmnet"" R package)
* Tweedie log-linked Elastic Net (Using ""HDtweedie"" R package)
* Tweedie GBM (Using ""TDboost"" package)
* Extreme GBM

**Model Performance (In order of what I looked at):**

* Maximizing Gini Coefficient
* Maximizing deviance ratio (1- Model Deviance/ Null Deviance)
* minimizing RMSE
* Model Complexity via Degrees of Freedom
* minimizing AIC

The tweedie based packages are hard to extract information out of, so it's hard to compare each model. For instance, I can't figure out how to get deviance ratio from the Tweedie ENET, but can get RMSE and gini.  Poisson ENET performed the best GINI, but had worse RMSE and DF.  The Tweedie ENET had a lower RMSE, but also lower gini. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem is that when I bin the ordinal discrete data such as ""Year Built"", it loses the monotonic assumption so can lead to some non-intuitive coefficients.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a hobby where I keep track of football statistics in a mySQL database. I'm currently using MySQL Workbench for consults and I have a couple of forms I built to enter data. 

I have 80 years of data now and I need to make more complex ""questions"" and at the same time, present the information in a better way. (Graphics, heatmaps, etc.)

So far I've read about ""BI"" tools for data analysis yet they seem to be oriented for Big Data which is not my case. (Still I'm going to give it a try to Apache Superset.)

&amp;#x200B;

So question: do you have any recommendations of any tools (don't need to be free) to integrate with a MySQL database and help me with: 

**Main needs:** 

\- Build consults through query language (don't need to be MySQL specific but would be better)

\- Be able to store those views in an organized matter (Goal Statistics, Match Statistics, etc.)

\- Be able to present the results in different ways (Graphics, tables, etc.) 

\- Keep a live connection with the database (I don't have time to extract data and enter it in another tool.)

\- Works on MAC!

**Nice to Have:**

\- Friendly way to enter data.

\- Possibility to have users (I'll probably hire some data entry to fill in the blanks)

Some categories though have a large amount of factors. At the end column, there's the recommendation (with binary factors) which leads me to believe that either this dress was recommended or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've only discussed K-Means, and I don't see that being useful here. I've researched and saw Multiple Correspondence Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the features, but that apparently only works if all the features are categorical. Another teacher suggested I create bins for the only numerical data, and apply that, and go from there. Ultimately, my goal is to create a classifier that can classify a dress given features into a yes or no for recommendation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also read another paper that proposes K-prototypes, but I'm afraid I didn't really understand it all very much, even after reading this medium article ([https://medium.com/@Chamanijks/k-prototype-in-clustering-mixed-attributes-e6907db91914](https://medium.com/@Chamanijks/k-prototype-in-clustering-mixed-attributes-e6907db91914)). I also read k-prototypes work for mixed data, but cannot have a null numerical data. The data set has, so I'm wondering how to approach that if ever. I have to admit I'm fairly new to all these algorithms as such. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this is looked down upon, but I do want to hear some suggestions for how to proceed. Idk in fact if what I want is simple or complicated, but at least a general direction and I can research from there. Thanks!",8,1,False,self,,,,,

The two questions where I failed:

What is a window function in SQL?

What is the difference between a dimension table and a fact table?

I told them I wasn't so sure. I researched what it was and I do window functions every day at work and use dimension tables every day at work !!!! I was unbelievably mad when I read up on this when I didn't know the technical meanings and names of these things despite doing it every day. 

After I reflected on it it makes me think what if companies or people who train junior analysts just use different naming conventions ? What's the differnece of knowing what it means versus knowing how to do it?

Those questions came after I told them about my background in reporting and essentially being in SQL every day and telling them about my personal projects in R and python (R and python are something we don't use at my job at the moment)

My question is, they specifically ask me to use a deep learning method and see how well it predicts, as far as I am aware a neural net needs labelled data to learn and predict so, how should I infer gender?

i am an Electrical engineer that is a amateur programmer on the side. I also like topics about finance and home automation and look for any excuse to program. Haven't coded much so starting to do more coding for my personal finances.

I have my all my transactions aggregated by a service i pay for, so i have the ability to do whatever analysis i want. So far i have only done basic sums and query function (this is on a google sheet) to give me a summary for a given month on what i am spending based on certain categories. Now i'm interested in doing more data analysis or statistical analysis while doing this using pandas in python to help me learn about both topics. (i know overkill a bit)

**One thing i am trying to do is gauge if I am on track or a little ahead of it on a given spending category. For example, restaurants is a category for any time i eat out, i would like to not only look at how much I have spent so far, how much i budgeted for, and how much that delta is but also would like to see if i am on track or ahead of schedule.** 

With this example so far I have only thought to do it similarly like my company measures our performance to our forecast. (FYI I am also a Product Manager and I work with planning on forecasting for revenue for any given quarter this is only part of my job). The way we track our revenue progress is **percent linearity**. It seems the calculation is pretty simple you just ""linearize"" your **target forecast** to ""hypothetically"" think what if you were to **divide this target by the number of days total in the quarter** (i.e. 90) then that gives you a daily value and if you are on **day 30 of the quarter so 1/3 in you would expect that you would have already 1/3 of your revenue** if you don't then you are below 100% linearity. 

I am not sure if this is the best way to do this analysis but its how my company does it. However for my finances, since i want to learn data science a bit better i want to do this by the book maybe do some typical methodology and try to adopt it for my finances. I have read a lot about **linear regression** but not sure if this is what i should be using.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As the title implies, I'm going to be graduating this upcoming May with a masters in Statistics with a concentration in Data Science. I plan on starting to send job applications in a few weeks in advance in hopes of landing my first salary job in the data science field. 

I am both equally excited for this new chapter in my life, but also quite nervous because I'm not exactly sure what the best method is to prepare for the job interviews or even land a first job, honestly. I don't have any work experience in data science nor did I go to a well-known prestigious school for my BS and MS (SJSU for my BS, CSU East Bay for my MS) so I feel like I'm already at a disadvantage when competing with other applicants. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some odd reason, my school didn't offer any classes in SQL and Python for my grad program so I had to learn those things myself using the online tools available like Codeacademy, etc. As a result, my SQL/Python skills aren't refined and are very much limited. Though, I have a lot of experience working with R, SAS, Excel, even Stata &amp; SPSS, from my schooling.  Because of this, I felt that if I were to try to apply for Data Scientists/Data Analysts Entry level roles, I would have been pretty screwed considering I don't know much SQL and Python.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why, my initial thought process going forward was to apply for other Entry level roles like Business Analysts and other analytical positions that didn't stress so much on programming like Python. I could very well be wrong on this, which is why I wanted to ask for some clarity if the way I'm thinking is justified?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a plethora of other questions I wanted to ask as well such as:

1) Are cover letters necessary? Do companies even bother looking through those?

2) How should I best prepare for job interviews? What should I study to prepare in general?

3) When's the best time to start applying for jobs? I was told by my adviser that between now-March is the best time.

4) What are the most important traits/skills to succeed in data science? I would like to know so I can know what to polish/learn.

5) Best way to land a 1st data science job without any prior relatable work experience? 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that a lot that I ask is really broad, but I know that there are countless others out there thriving in the world of data science and also some who are also in similar shoes as I am right now so I thought that the best path to succeed is to ask for help. I would really appreciate the guidance!

The idea behind *Black Swans Meetups* is that: if data-scientists meet with new data-scientists, they will discover wildly different (often better) approaches, models, etc., which can be applied to whatever they are working on.

Paul Erds, the most prolific mathematician ever to have lived, recognised this. He was always travelling around, staying with different mathematicians who gave him new ideas to prove new theorems. His motto was another roof, another proof.

I imagine each meetup would be held in some capital city, and data-scientists could go to share ideas, give cool presentations about what theyre working on, etc.

As a Golang developer,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/aovy5n/looking_forward_to_my_first_offer_as_a_golang/,flappymcnasty,1549742041,"Hello data friends! I just wanna check in and share my journey over the last few years. It's atypical, and maybe the outcome would not be ideal for some of you but I think it's just dandy for me.

I graduated in 2014 with a double major in theoretical mathematics and behavioral science. Note, that this left me with no applied math like stats, and deep understanding of calculus and a little topology. I struggled to break into the tech world, and wound up doing a lot of random jobs, from retail to manual labor. 


I discovered data science and machine learning through Andrew Ng's coursera in 2016. I did the Galvanize DSi in early 2017, after about six months of self-study. During the job search, I continued working in a labor field I really enjoy (not going into it here, but it involves music, climbing on steel beams 100+ ft in the air, and a lot of rope). I ended up finding some contracts that supplemented that income well, and enjoyed the variety for a bit over a year. One of those contracts required me to learn Golang for ETL work. The same contract had a few opportunities for interesting mini-projects, but nothing really deep or involving machine learning.


At the end of 2018, I asked my boss at that company what the possibilities were for me in 2019, and he was honest. It'd be more of the same, and he didn't have the time or money to offer me more training to focus on development. So, I resumed my job search.

Since then, I did 51 applications. Four responses, three phone interviews, and then something strange happened. I had gotten to the in-person interview at a major organization, and the Golang experience on my resume caught their attention. I was forwarded to an engineering division, did a phone interview, code interview, then finally flew out this week for in-person interviews. No immediate offer, but I was told to ""start packing"" by their director of engineering as I left the building. 

My title and pay will be as a mid-level engineer, but they're hoping I can act as their liaison between engineering and data science and I am BEYOND stoked for the challenge. As I said above, I imagine the more academic folks here wouldn't be satisfied with this outcome, but I couldn't be happier. I'll be moving to an area of the country I love, working on a huge variety of tasks, with opportunities to learn and go back to school. 


It was a long, frustrating road to get here. 100% worth it. I was described as ""wild stallion ready to be broken in the interview."" Uncomfortable description, honestly, but entirely accurate. I've blazed my own trail, and it was scary and uncertain at times, but it's turned out well.

The data set is 3 years ('16-'18) of test results for the New York State mathematics exam for grades 3-8 (found here: https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php).

The files have all elementary and middles schools of every county in NYS, with student performance on the exam (aggregated by grade level). Student performance is measured in Levels, 1-4.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a senior economics student working as a research assistant as part of my final seminar course. The data I have been tasked with assisting in the analysis of involves a series of product catalogs collected by the professor from 1980-2002 called *Data Sources: Hardware Data Communications.* The data in these catalogs is primarily qualitative with each catalog listing computer firms and their products, with each product associated with a list of technical characteristics (such as the processor type, write speeds, memory, price, servicing availability, etc...). One of the goals of the project is to analyze firm leadership across time through the lens of product innovation.

&amp;#x200B;

While much of the data is yet to be compiled into a somewhat usable format (such as an excel spreadsheet),  I am currently looking to determine some potential methods for analysis. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example of my current thought process is to, for each product catalog and subcategory of products find the most common product feature (for example, processor A)  and then backtrack over time to see the first instance of that product feature (for example, Apple was the first to introduce processor A in 1980, and it has now become industry standard in 1982). This may provide some indication of firm leadership, especially if a firm/firms are shown to consistently introduce leading features before their competitors.  However, I am aware that this is a bit of a naive idea of how to think about the problem and am looking to find some more formal analysis methods.

&amp;#x200B;

What methods of analysis should I look to research so as to gain a better understanding of how these types of problems are approached?

Moreover, it seems the field is flooded with job candidates and PhDs

Since I really like math, programming and machine learning, but Data Scientist and Data/ML Engineer roles don't sound too appealing, I was curious if there were other roles that would be better fits for those who don't want to spend so much time on the data mungling?

The problem was that most of my analysis was shit. I spent maybe a good hour and half familiarizing myself with the data i.e. making distribution charts, doing "".describe()"", etc. I basically wasted a good chunk of my time trying to figure out if I could include more features, remove irrelevant observations ,etc. The dataset itself was also tricky so I was thinking of doing some other loss function i.e. the median was zero when the variable spanned \[0, inf\]. I was thinking of maybe trying out robust regression for this problem.  

&amp;#x200B;

Before I started modeling, I then wanted to test if the assumptions were valid to employ regression.  All of this was in one big ass lazy notebook.

In the middle of al this, I noticed I only had like 20 min. left and I didn't write anything down. I tried to clean up my notebook and made some random comments here and there. I did some garbage logistic regression and submitted it just as time was up. It's frustrating since I feel like I wasted a good majority of my time just thinking about the data.

There's also code for a web-app I built using flask, but I had no idea what I was doing there and am definitely not looking at jobs now that will require anything like that).

To learn, I am trying to create a simple code that can detect heartbeats from color variations from the image coming from the camera on the iPhone.

This is what I have done so far:

I have created a code that detects faces and cuts them from the image.
then I get the average color from that face image.

Because the values are grabbed at irregular time intervals, I interpolate the data. Now I have a series of values ""taken"" at regular intervals.

Plotting the data I have [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bFfGu.png)

I think I am seeing something that looks like heartbeats there.

To confirm that I am not seeing artifacts from the camera, I sample a rectangle from the background and I get the same color with very little random variation. The background color is stable and shows barely any variation.

Now, I apply a Direct Cosine Transform to the data and get [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMg17.png)

The DCT has negative vales.

The two first items of the DCT are peaks, at t=0 and t=0.10482311 seconds.

I read a paper where the researcher says heartbeats occur between 0.4 and 4Hz. I suppose this has a relation why the first two DCT items are peaks...

What do I do now?

I have tried to apply a threshold to zero every term from the DCT below 150 and do an inverse DCT to reconstruct the signal and got [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iAOcF.png).

A threshold of 85 gives me [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3ljx.png)

I can do those things.

However, I'm afraid I'm going to get stuck forecasting business metrics or something rather than, say, working on self-driving cars or virtual assistants. So I'm wondering if getting a job as a software engineer would be a more logical stepping-stone towards that goal, because at least the way I perceive a SWE's role, it's less ""business"" and more programming than what I think of when I visualize a Data Scientist. But alternatively, I'm worried I won't get to work with ML, NLP, computer vision etc. as a SWE rather than a Data Scientist, and this will hurt me years down the road when I apply to work on Telsa software or something. In summary, in the short term I'd rather focus on programming than business intelligence and getting cozy with the C-suite, but more importantly I also want to make sure my work will count as relevant experience with AI so I can eventually get a position focusing on robotics.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at many data science roles in the past few weeks as i am looking to further my career outside of the uk government - however i have been quite angry to find that most or if not a very large proportion of jobs online for mid level and even junior data science positions are requiring a Msc or PHD as a minimum requirement for the job role! 

&amp;#x200B;

Why does a MSc or PHD matter in this field as a requirement? It makes no sense at all - i've met people without those two, and have developed some really great pieces of work and packages in python and R - even they have been rejected from jobs because they don't have this MSc or PHD! So what the hell is going on! why do they even want it???

&amp;#x200B;

anyone else finding this common theme with job ads? mostly in the UK!

I have a bsc in mathematics and have been working as a data scientist for the past 2 years int he public sector - i have the skills and experience for these roles - but  i cannot past the minimum requirement being a phd or msc - so its like an automatic block - this is regardless of how well my kaggle profile is and how good my github projects are (they don't even look at them!)

Hopefully don't want to spam too much here, but basically Im the hiring manager and we are expanding our team out into the USA. We are facing new challenges and demands in the scope of our supply chain. In order to remain competitive, conventional methods and processes need to be reconsidered aiming to reduce lead time, increase productivity and subsequently customer satisfaction. The use of enhanced simulation / data &amp; analysis tools is one of the key elements in this context.

You will be part of the team that drives the industrialization and continued development of the supply chain processes to ensure the long term stability and availability. 

As an operations improvement analyst you will be required to work across the complete end to end supply chain. Working alongside the operational teams to support them diagnose, extract insights, troubleshoot and improve the processes and value for the customer.

The team is spread across the globe, matching our operational footprint. It means working in small, multi-disciplinary teams with a focus and responsibility on delivering pragmatic solutions directly to the teams.

**Tasks &amp; Accountabilities**

* You will conduct in-depth analyses (e.g. value stream mapping) to identify improvement opportunities. Understanding business processes and pain points, to gather requirements, opportunities and value levers regarding data and possible use of technologies for process automation
* Provide accurate and insightful data analyses for different operational teams and explain and interpret your findings
* You will take part in complex projects involving several departments within the organization
* You will proactively come up and develop solutions to improve performance within the supply chain environment based on advanced analytics and findings
* Acts as a coach to the functional teams

**Required Skills**

* Practical experience in lean, industrial, process development/improvement
* You have robust coding abilities (Python, SQL, Java) &amp; experience in algorithms, data structures would be a plus
* Experience in data extraction, manipulation and reporting 
* You understand the combination of data analytics and business processes with an appetence for business/industrial problem solving
* Ability to convince in a complex environment (to drive/help decision making across departments)
* You are a quick learner, passionate about your work and driven to get things done with a collaborative way of working
* Hands-on, pragmatic approach to building digital products (hacker / entrepreneurial mindset)

**Summary**

If I had to summarize basically its a nice mix of process improvement &amp; data analytics (significant amounts of the supply chain work we do are within SAP so there's an obvious overlap / synergy) The complete team all work in python and are very focused on real world supply chain problems. If it sounds something that's interesting please feel free to DM me for more info or have a look here at the opening.

Cheers

I accepted a position about a month ago at a notable data science, analytics, and management company that is your typical run of the mill big data tech startup you hear so much about. 

Im the only person in my cohort of coworkers who ISNT a computer science major. My coworkers are all graduates from big engineering schools, many of them are recent undergrad graduates as well. My expertise is in economics, but I could probably run circles around their supposed statistical skills. 

And this was demonstrated recently at a meeting on a large dataset we were tasked with analyzing. I cant give too much information, as we sign NDAs, but issues arose over what model we would apply. I worked with a similar dataset in my grad school days, and it seemed to me that a simple logistical regression model would suffice to explain the trends. 

Before I could give my reasoning for this, my CS coworkers interrupt me and say Well, thats too *simple* of an explanation, I say we try this deep machine learning neural algorithm to test out first. I exaggerate of course, it was a convoluted model that would be superfluous for such a large dataset.  I voiced my concerns and defended my model, but was scoffed and laughed at by my coworkers. They were joking about my Econ background, how did you even get to work at this tech company. Their banter was, expected, as Ive noticed thats how their personality is. But it still stung.

In particular I would like to know:

1. Do all Data Consultancies use the cloud or do some use private servers for added security?
2. What security measures are available in the Google Cloud Platform specifically?
3. What security measures are available with in Private servers?
4. Any other security measures that may be important when a client trusts you with their data.

I appreciate this may be super-specific so even if someone could point me in the right direction to answering these questions that would be amazing.

I'm setting up a data science project/codebase that will need to be applied to different datasets/in slightly different contexts, with a modular and customisable approach. For the sake of discussion, let's assume I want to build code, notebooks and analysis for data coming from 3 countries: `uk`, `us` and `jp`.

I'm using a structure similar to [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

A few questions on best practices:

- Should I create a separate folder in the different codebase areas (`data`, `references`, etc) for each case? i.e. `data/uk/raw`, `data/jp/raw`? Or `data/raw/us`, `data/raw/uk`?
- How should I think about code modularity? Should my notebooks and scripts include a general `country` variable at the top and then run everything using this? So preset to `country=""uk""`?

There is nothing wrong in asking, but they do not know that adding more data is not like a click away. Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it could take days. So what would you do?

As I jot down the problem, I thought of a fews things we can do, so my 2 cents here:

1. make your model more flexible; anticipate the additional ask
2. be smart about how you share the results: if you know they will ask for more however comprehensive your model is, release in phases
3. clarify the objective: what do you want to prove? what is the hypothesis? how does adding additional data help?

When should you do pre-processing to avoid over fitting?

Do you do it both on the training and the test set, which may give you different values. Or do you apply the same values from the training set to the test set, which may lead to over-fitting.

I am confused by this quote below. For example, if you use mode imputation for a class on the training set, should you use mode imputation on the class for the test set, even if you get a different mode? Also, if you use mean imputation for numerical data in the training set, should you also use mean imputation on the test set (meaning you will have a different mean value than the training set)?

""To provide a solid methodology, one should constrain themselves to developing the list of preprocessing techniques, estimate them only in the presence of the training data points, and then apply the techniques to future data (including the test set).""

So I'm currently working as a DS for the federal government. The way I ended up here was sort of a strange path but in short there was no real interview, I was doing the work, involved other DS in the organization despite not having that title - and when the title did come available, those who were hiring were already intimately familiar with my skill set so the interview was a bit of a formality. To be fair, this has been the case for much of the last decade, I have let my reputation and work stand for itself and thus never really had interviews. 

Now I find myself potentially having to transition out of this role and switching to a new field completely (where I have no reputation), and have been interviewing with a number of DS roles in the private sector. 

I just had a technical screen for large financial institution, which remarkably was the 3rd of 4 interview steps. The format was in google docs and on the phone, 2 technical leads pasted a problem/puzzle and asked me to code a solution in the language of my choice - in front of them - on a blank google word doc. And I froze up. Literally, I turned into a bunch of 'ummmm, well, ummmm's, very very embarrassing. After a few excruciating minutes, I basically asked if I could just fuck of and do it on my own in jupyter notebook, they said sure all good. 

The allotted time I had was 1hr and I came up with a really nice clean and efficient solution on my own in about 30 minutes and returned it to them.  Honestly, the solution made me say 'fuck yea, thats nice' to myself - but I feel that it may fall on deaf ears due to my first round of performance anxiety. 

So to wade through my post above it comes down to this:

**TLDR;** I am not a script kid, I dont even really consider myself a coder. I'm 'good' at a few languages, but I don't peg myself as fluent beyond the basics (create a dataframe, write an if statement, write a while loop, etc..), but is this on the spot, ""write code for me now monkey"" coding challenge going to be something that is the norm for the industry - or will it be more of a 'you have x amount of time to solve this and submit' type ordeal. Because if the later, I think I'll be ok, if the former, I may need a lot more practice. ",27,1,False,self,,,,,

Im currently developing customer segmentation for my customers, using the RFM model. Im splitting into 5 percentiles per metric and the recency and monetary metrics behave exactly as expected, with a very even spread across the percentiles.
However, as I have a lot of customers who have a frequency of 1 (around 45% of all customers), my lowest two percentiles are practically identical, with the top percentile having the largest range (10 - 700+). 
I understand this is how percentiles work - they spread everything evenly, but the frequencies themselves dont seem even. 

As this is my first time using the RFM model, Im wondering if this is normal, or if there is a way people have dealt with these types before. 
I have tried removing these 1 frequency customers from my percentiles and then giving them their own segment after the fact (providing they dont fit any of my other segments of course) and this helped somewhat, but want to see if Im doing the right thing here.

I've noticed that when it comes to \*reporting\* analytics, we are using a relatively antiquated way of going about things. We're relying on Excel spreadsheets to present information for the most part where the data comes from Business Objects. This existing system is convenient in some ways but probably more limiting, I'd argue:

* the information is updated on a set schedule (when reports are distributed via email) and we rely on the IT team to help with the distribution
*  the majority of the reports are static and not very interactive (e.g. they just report fixed numbers and limit those who view the reports to just a specific perspective)
* Business Objects is very limited on visualizations and many of the reports currently distributed could likely be re tailored as graphical reports, more effectively conveying the main ideas through visualizations.
* There is a database I have access to and I have a good SQL background. I'd like to build something that will have users retrieve data from this using a user-friendly interface. 

I was thinking building a website to display real-time analytics, visualizations and interactivity would add a tremendous benefit to the company, much more so than what's currently in place. Since I've never actually built a site nor am I familiar with what goes into it, I was researching tools I could use and solutions like Shiny for R and Dash for Python came up. I would still very much consider my skills between the two to be somewhere between beginner and intermediate, but I'm willing to learn either one if I could improve the company's analytics. I'm probably going to follow through with Shiny as it seems easier, but I wanted to see if there were other, potentially better solutions out there you folks would recommend.

Should also add: this company is a rather large corporation and data security is of the upmost importance. ",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I dropped out of high school close to a decade ago and entered the work force. Now, for reasons irrelevant to this, I am moving out of that job &amp; am not going to be able to (nor do I want to) find employment in the same industry.

I've always nurtured a personal interest in Science and Technology, albeit from a very lay/popular perspective. Based on this a friend recommended I get into Data Analytics, advising me that the demand for this skill is only going to rise in the future. 

I haven't the qualifications or financial resources to pursue an institutional education &amp; I was thinking of following [this guide](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-programming-courses-data-science/) to the relevant MOOCs. I have completed two [MOOCs in Python programming](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) from The University of Michigan. I found those to be pretty easy to follow and I did well on both. I'm worried about my ability when it comes to Statistics, however. I've never been very good with Maths.

Regardless, assuming that I do successfully gain the certificates (and thus the necessary skills?!?) - recommended in the guide I linked above - how realistic would it be for me to make US $ 20K a year working freelance and/or remotely with these qualifications?

Thanks for the advice.

To add some context the ideal outcome is to predict / forecast revenue as accurately as possible. Assume revenue is being committed for a future date (think airlines or hotel rooms), and that there are constraints to be accounted for with overall occupancy (limited supply of spaces to be filled, again think airlines or hotels).

The problem is that I could just use university or multivariate time series and/or other supervised methods to accomplish this, but they leave out the context of the rate at which revenue is being committed, of which there are both recent trends that are relevant as well as seasonal trends.

When compiling this in the data this leads me to an impasse where Im not certain exactly how to proceed.

 There are two date parameters - the stay date or flight date (I.e. the day for which you are committing revenue) and there are effective dates between now and they stay date which are used to quantify the rate of committed revenue against a given stay date.

In this situation is it better to try to retain a multivariate time series method to preserve the function of forecasting out to a set horizon by adding attributes that capture rate of committed revenue and days out from stay date, or would it be more advantageous to iteratively predict one stay date or stay period at a time considering the full set of effective dates at which the additional pickup in revenue is measured?

Additionally are there methods that can do both? 

If this is an overly simplistic question please just simply point me to any resources that may address this, otherwise Im open to discussion on this topic.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a chemical engineer with an interest in data science, particularly in Bayesian Modeling after reading [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) which I highly recommend.  I'm not a very experienced data scientist, or python programmer for that matter, so while the motivating examples were really interesting, I'm having a hard time translating this in to workable problems to practice with in my daily life.

&amp;#x200B;

I came across a problem recently at work which I think fits the bill, but I'm not really sure how to approach it.  The context is as follows. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a batch process that yields a bunch of drums of a material.  The material has some property (turbidity) which can range from say, 0-1000, and should be the same for each drum in the batch.  The drums are then consumed to produce the final packaged product, where turbidity is measured.  For a number of (bad) reasons, the drums are chosen randomly, so you can have several drums from different batches which contribute to the final measurement.  What I have thanks to the QC people is a list of turbidity measurements for final product and a detailed list of the drums which went in to each one.  So a data point might be Turbidity = 100, which was made with 1 drum from batch 3, 1 drum from batch 6 and two drums from batch 8.  And I've got a couple dozen of these.  Safe to assume that the measured turbidity is a simple average of the drums that went in.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to do is to calculate posterior distributions of the turbidity for each batch based on the observed final product measurements.  

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I created a model with a uniform prior for each batch, and used the turbidity measurements as observed data, but I'm not sure that's quite right.  In the example above, I would create another uniform distribution for say, batch 8, and set observed to \[100,100\].  But this ignores the contributions of the other batches.  This gives results which are broadly consistent with frequentist thinking, where the priors quickly converge to the average of the each measurement the batch was involved in, but qualitatively I feel like it's really underestimating the uncertainty given the way the data is generated and the small data sets.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to start modeling this?  Thanks!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

See, ive found an average of 94% correlation of the true statistics with the main variable after a sample of 46 (thats the most I can get in a single sample). And although the inmense majority of samples have a 90%+ correlation, there are a few outliers, and the biggest one was just 74% correlation at that point. 


So in adjusting for future corrections, should I take into account the average correlation up to that point? Or should I take the mininum correlation as to not miss anyone? 

Note: not taking into account corrections has proven way worse in mi predictions that do taking them (I only take them with the lowest correlation though).

Im leaving my corporate gig in a few weeks to take time off, but I wanted to spend some of that time honing and practicing skills I picked up on the job. Specifically we have been working extensively with Alteryx and Tableau and I have past years of experience with SQL, Access, Excel, and VBA.

If I wanted to continue with these skills, or try to translate them into some side gigs on a low budget, what are some of the best options out there? So far Ive found Knime (as a replacement for Alteryx) and have taken a look at Jupyter as a means to play with both R and Python. Although I personally found the single user license for Tableau affordable Ive heard that Bokeh may be another option in the 'free' zone for visualizations.

I am guessing the minimum memory will correspond to simply the number of weight parameters that are trained/stored in the SVM model and used for predictions. I understand the dimensions of the weight parameters will differ based on what kind of kernel is being used. Here is what I think is the answer to the questions is for different models:

  
Linear kernel- the minimum memory needed here should be for storing (N+2) weight parameters, similar to that of a linear regression model (N parameters for N features + 1 intercept parameter) + 1 regularizer (C) parameter

&amp;#x200B;

RBF/Gaussian kernel- the minimum memory needed here should be for storing (N+3) weight parameters: N weights for N features, 1 intercept parameter, 1 regularizer parameter, and 1 gamma parameter that decides the spread of Gaussian distribution

&amp;#x200B;

Complex- non-linear Kernel:   
For a kernel with a decision boundary like this ([https://imgur.com/NM6NFgS](https://imgur.com/NM6NFgS)) I am guessing the minimum number of weight parameters would be &gt;2N+1,  and depend on how complex of a kernel I am creating.  


Is my reasoning through this answer correct? Please let me know if it's not. Also, if I am being dumb and missing the whole point of the question and if there's some other obvious way to minimize memory, please do let me know about that as well. Thank you

The team and I have just finished iterating the model for our 4th product. However, there's almost 200 products in total and we're debating how many models we actually want to create. 

The issue is, many of the products are related. Reducing 1 products price may increase sales by 100%, but 3 other similar products reduce by 10%. Alternatively, reducing one product could create a ""halo"" effect, which increases other similar products.

The products have some similar features, but some are unique to the subcategory the product is in.

I would like to share my personal data science project on how I analyzed my weight loss data in 2018. You can read my [writeup](https://link.medium.com/9KJRGuzsqU) on the project on Medium, and check out its Github [repo](https://github.com/dknguyengit/logweight).

The 2 main goals for the project are:

* Build a machine learning model (namely regularized logistic regression) to classify whether I would gain weight or lose weight on a given date. The parameters of the model (the regression coefficients and the decision boundary) are also used to give simple, actionable numbers that I could use for my weight loss journey.

* Build this machine learning model from scratch without using 3rd-party libraries (aside from numpy and pandas). This includes the model algorithm (batch gradient ascent), k-fold cross validation, performance metrics, ROC curve, and other related visualizations.

I've tried to tailor my writing to be accessible to beginners (as I'm also a relative beginner to data science). Therefore, I'd truly appreciate any input on how I can make my writing and visualizations better.

Also, I'm planning to do a 30-day challenge, during which I followed the guideline outlined in the project, and see how consistent I can lose weight doing so (perhaps via daily updates through a Twitter account). I think it might be fun to use this as a real-life test set for my model, but I'm afraid of the potential public failure. If you've read my Medium post, please let me know what you think about this idea.

Please also let me know if you have any question or feedback on my project!",20,47,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a beginner in the data science domain, and I am starting to apply to related jobs.  I have a PhD in Computer Science, but since I focused on more theoretical topics related to Knowledge Engineering, I only recently (2 months) started learning topics such as Python programming and Machine Learning. I know I do not have much hope in getting a job right now, but I am looking for challenges and opportunities to learn.

I come to you asking for insights on how to proceed with a coding exercise I was given. It is an open ended one, and I am supposed to improve the internal site search of the company I am applying to. The output can be a visualization, a predictive model, a framework of a data product. I was provided with a sample of data from the following business areas/dimensions:

1. Products: a CSV containing data such as id of the object searched, its name, a description, category, etc...,
2. Queries: a CSV containing example of queries with timestamp, session id, user\_id, and the query (a simple string).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am kind of stumped on how to approach this exercise, since it is very much open-ended. My guess is that I should create some programs for a user to do queries that can exploit the richness of the product file info, so I am guessing that I will need to do some trials with scikit-learns to develop some machine learning models to maybe predict the behavior of a user that searches certain types of products or a query engine that can discriminate similar objects via filtering. Does any of these ideas make sense and are related to data science or am I missing something due to my novice status? Notice that I am not expecting somebody to do this for me, I am taking this as a learning opportunity to try with a real life dataset to build something  and exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance

Hi there, my friend has built [DataDrivenJS](https://datadrivenjs.com/) which is like a hosted database populated with information about the activity that happens on your website that you can access using a simple JavaScript API with no backend required on your end.

How does DataDrivenJS works;:

* Track data from your website in a similar way that many web analytics do
* Write queries to expose some data as publicly accessible Data Feeds 
* Read the data from the created Data Feeds and use it on your website as social proof, urgency, a recommendation system and a lot more. 

What can it be used for;

* Creating recommendation system / processes
* Creating social proof system / processes
* Creating personalization system / processes
* Creating any type of system based on the data capture by DDJS.

If you are a developer for an ecommerce, online booking or similar website, you can DataDrivenJS  for use cases and conditions like these;

* Show Best Sellers to new visitors
* People who bought this also bought that recommendations
* Selling Like Crazy - buy or cry ( hot selling products)
* Sort products by conversion or popularity
* Number of sales of X product today / week etc
* Show Recent Signups ( Of Pricing Plan, Of Region)
* Show XX% people select annual plan for extra discount
* Someone just booked xyz room / hotel / flight / ticket
* XX People today bought ticket to xyz room / hotel / flight / ticket

Why use DataDriveJS and not any other tool?

* All the features are 100% Free to use for up till 250K users. Other tools limit you for features as well as number of users / month. For example, Fomo and UseProof starts at $200 / ,month for same features and # of users
* Tons of flexibility - your website, your data, your feeds, all in your control! .With traditional packaged solution, youre development and customization imagination is limited to their features.
* Doesnt require any installation, database or any other cost
* Work directly with co-founder for improving product

To get you started, here are some step by step guided ways you can use it;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to the data science field and on a quest to learn it on my own, mostly from home. Everything data science related is new to me. I've just started learning Python, mySQL, linear algebra, and statistics. During my down time I browse the Internet for news about data science and watch a lot of YouTube tutorials. That gave me the brilliant idea that I should do a news show about data science (from a beginner's perspective) and also a series called Know Your Field where I talk about major players, concepts, and tools in the data science field.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I hear a lot about Gartner reports, but know very little about Gartner, so I'm doing a company summary to help me put all Gartner related news in better context. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll do the same thing for:

* leading data science and AI companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc
* think/fact tanks like Pew Research Center, etc
* people like DJ Patil, etc, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1. Do you think such summaries are helpful to anyone else but me?
2. If you think they could be useful, can you tell me what kind of info you'd like to see in the summary?

&amp;#x200B;

Using Gartner as an example again, so far I have information about their history, products and services, revenues and income, competitors, Glassdoor reviews, social media presence, missed predictions. I gathered way too much info and I want to cut it down to a one page summary.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for a news show, would you be interested in general type of news or more specific news (eg. how data science is applied in different fields, companies, countries, etc but without specific details about algorithms, programming languages, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your feedback.

I have a sample of n observations from dataset X. Each observation from this sample have feature f. I want to compare performance of these observations with ones that don't have this feature.

Problem is that I've identified few variables which have different distribution in this subsample compared to the whole population in dataset X.

To get reasonable results I'd like to select another subsample from dataset X that is similar to my sample based on all variables but feature f.

Can this be easily done in Python?

Now, you want to create a personalised ranking of items for each user. So we can train N models say M1, M2, M3, ... Mn etc. Some of those models will be content based or collaborative filtering based or hybrid or simple popularity based models. So, each of these models create ranklist Ri. What would you do if you have to create a single rank-list out of multiple rank-lists R1, R2, ..., Rn.

My approach is that I define a ranking function f(u,v) = w1 * R1(u,v) + w2 * R2(u,v) + ...... + w3 * Rn(u,v) where u = user, v = item, wi = weights, R(u,v) = rating given to item v by user u.

In order to train a ML model, I sample positive and negative examples for each user and create training examples like with features [R1(u,v), R2(u,v), ... Rn(u,v)]  and target 1 for positive example and 0 for negative example. We can then train a model on this and learn the weights w1, w2, ...., wn.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a data scientist currently working at one of the bigger West Coast (USA) tech companies. I've always thought it would be fun to work in Europe for a stint, and it seems I might have an opportunity coming up in Sweden (a few other countries might be on the table). As I'm investigating the trade-offs, I've been particularly surprised regarding the difference in salary ranges for technical IC roles (data science or software engineering, in particular). 

&amp;#x200B;

In my current role, I'm a senior technical IC with over 15 years of mixed software development and data science experience. At my current role, my yearly compensation is in the range of 250-300k USD total compensation per year before taxes (about 20k USD per month, or 190k SEK per month). In researching roles in Stockholm, I have heard that similar roles pay in a range of 50-70k SEK per month. Is this consistent with your experience? Does the salary band go much higher? At my company 50-70k SED (\~65-90k USD) would fall below the range for entry-level positions. This is also before taxes, which would increase from \~25-30% up to 45-50%.

&amp;#x200B;

* Have any of you taken roles abroad after working for a number of years in the US? What is the potential range for senior/principal technical IC roles?
* What other elements of living in Europe would balance the apparent disparity in salaries?
* It appears there is a pension/savings system in place (paid for by employers? I need to do more research here) 
* While healthcare related expenses would be lower, the difference is not significant given our age, good health, and high-quality insurance thats largely paid for by our US employers (reducing spend from \~2-3k down to \~100)
* Since we dont have children and we dont plan to, we will not benefit directly from family/child benefits (childcare, school, etc.)

I am a software engineer by profession, who was working in a bank in Hong Kong in a business analyst kinda role. I saved enough and moved to Melbourne to pursue my masters in Data Science from RMIT. 1 semester into the course I am confused is it even worth it ? My reasons:

1. It's expensive .
2. It's not intense - classes happen only 3 hours a day(1 course a week) that too late evenings. 
3. The college - read RMIT - doesn't even offer all the electives listed in course. 

my friend is suggesting me to drop this course and head to Germany (TU Munich or similar) as the course quality is better and tuition is free.  any thoughts or experience will be helpful.

We deal a lot with retail sales data and we want to be able to forecast sales for any/all 10s of thousands of items. Pretty well versed in Python so I have no problem generating the code needed to rip through the data to create the time series models (Prophet), but with time series data, any time we forecast, we will need to retrain the models since new data would be available. I have no experience in deploying and maintain that many models. We use the Azure Cloud platform. Any tips are appreciated. Thank you.

I have seen so many articles relating to deploying a single model, but is usually not a time series model. This situation would be akin to the [Rossman Sales Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). They want to forecast sales for 1000 of their stores each with its own sales data. Didn't see any discussions on there regarding actual deployment of those approaches in practice.

We want to either have an endpoint stood up that will grab the trained model for that week and spit back the forecast, but if that is all it does then we might as well do a bulk update and persist the results. We could do it just-in-time and only update the model as it is used and have a model expire after a while.

Just not sure on best practices for this type of problem. How do companies forecast for all of their items like at Wal-Mart and Amazon? Thank you.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm having a hard time finding out ressources (books or web articles) that will introduce and explain me in depth machine learning algorithms (modelling) and math behind exploration. Indeed I've already done some advanced maths in school (I'm now in business school) and I'm trying to skip these parts going straigth to the explanation / demonstration of formula and algorithms used in data science (math applied to data science).  


&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I've done in math, I'm not english so I've tried to translate and summarize my math syllabus :

&amp;#x200B;

 **Analysis**

* Usual functions
* Generalities on functions
* Limitations
* Neglect and equivalence
* Continuity
* Derivability
* Sequences and series
* Integrals, imroper integrals
* Limited development
* Functions of 2 var : continuity
* Functions of 2 var : differential calculus and extremums

&amp;#x200B;

**Linear algebra** 

* Matrices
* Vectors
* Linear systems and applications
* Square matrices and endomorphisms

&amp;#x200B;

**Probability**

* Probability spaces 
* Conditioning and independence 
* Random variables, discrete random variables:
* Usual discrete laws
* Couples of discrete variables
* Covariance and correlation 
* Suites of discrete variables
* Random variables at density
* Conventional density laws
* Convergences
* Estimate

&amp;#x200B;

I do not master all these notions as these courses go back from 2 years ago, that's why I'm looking for in-depth explanation of data sciences applied maths.

* Master's in physics from a good school (~#20 in US)
* 3 papers published (although I'm not the first authors) 
* 2 years of Python experience in college (statistical data analysis)
* 3 years of miscellaneous coding experience in grad school (mostly handling data, flipping and slicing huge arrays)

Currently, I am 

* Working through Coursera's Algorithms course and loving it 
* Brushing up my Python skills with Kaggle 
* Vaguely interested in ML and data science
* Working as a tutor in math and science including Classical Mechanics, Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, etc.  
* Would like to quit tutoring soon and move on. I like teaching, and I'm pretty good at it, but I feel like I'd be stuck here forever if I just kept tutoring.

Plan #1 

* Apply for any Python coding jobs, and hopefully get one 
* Continue working on the online CS courses
* Work on data science and machine learning side projects 
* Apply for data-sciency jobs in 2 years 
* Keep moving in that direction 

Plan #2

* Tutor ~10 hours a week for money 
* Work on online courses and personal projects 40~50 hours a week 
* Build a convincing portfolio to land an entry-level data scientist position

&amp;#x200B;

Approach: 

1) I will start off by posting top level comments as generic skill sets that are either business, technical, statistics and mathematics related.

2) Upvote the ones you believe are important core skill sets, but DO NOT downvote any other skills if you disagree/don't know is key. If you don't agree with a skill set not being core, simply don't upvote.

3) Leave your comments as second level comments so the top comments are always relating to the skills in question.

4) Add skills you think are important but you don't find them in top level comments.

5) By the end of the whole exercise, with enough votes, I believe we should then be able to see our crowdsourced key skills for this profession that are sought after and are important to being a good data scientist/analyst (note: my methodology may have loopholes, so please feel free to suggest some changes, I have a research methodology and statistics background but don't profess to be a expert, so comments welcomed)

I graduated with a B.A. in mathematics from a great state school but with a 2.76 overall GPA. I did however have an average GPA of 3.3 my final 2 years of undergraduate. When i first graduated I had no idea what I wanted to do and I had barely any luck finding a job. I applied to anything requiring a math degree and luckily got a job as a data entry specialist for a small contract manufacturer. I was promoted to junior data analyst after 3 months and absolutely fell in love with the field and have been a data analyst for about 10 months. I love data analytics and have begun to find an interest in data science - specifically machine learning. I am currently taking IBM's Data Science professional certificate online on coursera. It has sparked my interest even further and I am only about 2/3rds done. I am looking for any sort of advice/tips for my current career plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan:

1) pivot to a new company in a similar entry-level analyst role (no upward mobility at current position) and hopefully climb through the ranks.

2) Become Sr. Analyst/Lead analyst for a team/project at my company

3) Return to college either online or on campus to earn a M.S. in data science. I am hoping that possibly my company could fund my continuing education, but I know that I definitely want to get the M.S. whether I pay for it completely out of pocket or my employer will help pay. I am hoping to be able to have a project in mind to either create a new product or improve one of our current products using some sort of machine learning algorithm that I need the education to learn how to develop. 

3A: I am somewhat worried about my return to higher education given i had an undergraduate GPA of 2.76. I am worried that this will hold me back on with admissions and actually being admitted to a program.

4) Become data scientist at my current company and develop a new product/innovation using my new education. 

5) Become chief data scientist at my company/look elsewhere to find the role.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know if this sounds solid and if getting a M.S. in data science is truly that much of a difference. I've read everywhere that it can definitely put you a bit ahead of some candidates but haven't been able to find many career stories that didn't involve receiving an M.S. in the field.

I sometimes use Python at my job and I also do some small personal projects in Python at home. 

I started learning data science and the tooling around it close to 4 years ago, and I began with Python. The single biggest challenge as someone not coming from a computer science background was getting my laptop up and running correctly. It was partly for this reason that I gravitated to the R ecosystem because it felt so much easier to begin working with data. 

Now that I am both more familiar with Python and working with programming tools more broadly, I want to transition to Python at work and home but... my personal laptop is a complete kludge of installs, environments, paths, you name it. 

Essentially, I tried following a variety of tutorials and blog posts to get my Python data science set up going 4 years ago without knowing what I am doing. I would like to be able to effectively clean up my Python workflow and tooling, but I can't find any tutorials or resources for going from a complicated mess of a laptop to a clean work flow. All of the resources I have found are about setting up Python the first time. I apologize if this is vague but I am just hoping to find some sort of tutorial that explains how to go from a messy Python existence to a clean one. 

Essentially I am trying to work towards having ```anaconda``` installed in a ```virtualenv```. I want to be able to launch ```jupyter lab``` from the command line within the ```virtualenv```, as well as having the ```flake8``` linter package installed and the path configured correctly to use with ```Atom``` in the same ```virtualenv```.

have been trying to figure this one out for a week.

The prompt states: ""We trained a SVM classifier which takes input vectors (with N features) and produces binary outputs using a Gaussian Kernel. To perform classification on new data samples, the trained parameters of the SVM model need to be stored using as little memory as possible. How much memory is needed?""

I feel like this minimum memory corresponds to the minimum number of weight parameters in my model.

For inputs with N features, from my understanding of SVM, the input data-points need to be mapped to a 1D space where each data point corresponds to a value, and the binary classification is determined by whether this value crosses a threshold (this threshold is determined when training the model based on the C and gamma parameters selected)

So, to my understanding, the minimum number of parameters to store a binary Gaussian SVM classifier is N+1, corresponding to a N X 1 vector for mapping the input into a 1D space, and the final parameter for storing the threshold value. Is this reasoning correct?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Right now I am just working 2 part-time jobs as a server and learning the ins and outs of an environmental consulting startup business. The consulting business would not be a paying job till summertime and has nothing to do with my degree.

My original plan was to purse a career in actuarial science but I'm not competitive enough compared to other applicants.

Not sure what kind of job to search for...or what field related to my degree because I'm scared that it would not be what I hoped for.  I've been applying everywhere and no interviews yet.

Grad school is out of the picture for now, I need a job ASAP for $$ and experience. MBA in the future? IDK.

I've been thinking about completing a 1 year Certification in Practice of Data Analytics through Ohio State, but I am not sure how helpful that might be.  I have to complete 4 courses that cost about $800 each.  The next course starts in a couple days and I can complete the certification by the end of this year.

I was wondering if completing this certification is more beneficial than completing say another online month long data analytics certification.

I was wondering what your experiences are when it comes to Segregation of Duties.
I am working in financial industry and quite often I find the role of data scientist a bit problematic with regards to the standard Business/IT/Operations setup that is enforced. 
Just to clarify - in essence it comes down to a point where one should not be allowed to keep production data on development servers, having write rights on development servers is allowed only for IT developers, developers cannot have access to production data... I think you get the point. I can hardly imagine the work of a data scientist without the possibility of trying out various algorightms on production (non-scrambled) data.

My second question is about publishing those plots. I would need a running python process in the background when having the plots exposed because with a pure HTML file the browser can only interpret the javascript code embedded in the plot.

I am a budding data scientist working for a major municipality. In 2018 we started as a small data science team of 4, working from our laptops. Eventually, we got a linux server where we could host our work and deploy our first model on. However, this server is hosted outside of our company's architecture.

During this time, our municipality is making a hard push to become data driven, including automation of data entry, storage, and an overhaul of our IT architecture. I feel this is an excellent opportunity to take our data science team to the next level, and try to push for a small but complete architecture that can help us deploy our models internally. This would be a major help since we could directly connect to the existing databases (where now we have to use manual extracts to feed our models).

However, this is where my knowledge gets stuck. I have been reading up on things like linux, spark, docker, etc. But it's difficult for me to form a comprehensive overview of what architecture is standard for data scientists, and (maybe more important since I have to defend and push for this) why we would need this. 

For example: I try to push for docker implementation in order to shorten the gap between our new engineering team and the end product of data scientists (since the engineers want to use docker too). However, I don't know exactly why docker works so well for this and why it is better than other tools. However, I need to know this in order to defend our choices.

Any help with a comprehensive overview providing me with a structure regarding architecture and deployment would help greatly! (or anyone chiming to provide their knowledge from experience).

Objective: Binary classification of whether transaction is fraud (1) or non fraud (0). 

&amp;#x200B;

After loading the dataset in, I have done some basic feature engineering (normalization \[-1,1\] etc). Next, I separate the non fraud class (0) from the fraud class (1) (values as well as target variable).

&amp;#x200B;

After doing this, I feed only the non fraud data/target as my training data into the autoencoder using Mean Squared Error as my metric of evaluation. From my understanding, this is what will serve as the Reconstruction Error that is being used to compare the classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I predict using the autoencoder on the fraud class (1) data and calculate the Reconstruction Error on that data.

&amp;#x200B;

So I work in the insurance industry, and I'm trying to model losses. We already have a model (very simplistic GLM type thing) that models loss. I am using XGBoost to target claim counts (poisson distribution) using the log(Exposures )(length of time of a policy) as the base margin in order to account for varying policy lengths.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue that I'm having is that the model seems to be so closely correlated with our existing model that it's useless. The main factors in my tree based model are the ones that we clearly rate on already. What I really want to be targeting is the unaccounted for losses. Losses on things that we currently don't capture in our existing rate structure. Essentially, losses that are very unexpected given our existing model. Is there a way to do this?

1012,datascience,t5_2sptq,2019-2-27,2019,2,27,8,av6bk4,self.datascience,My Bootcamp Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/av6bk4/my_bootcamp_experience/,Fonduemeup,1551224601,"I recently graduated from a bootcamp and received a full time offer as a data scientist, so I wanted to share my story with you all. I hope it leads to some healthy discussion and erases some biases many have about bootcamps in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked previously as a financial analyst and realized it's a much harder struggle to climb the corporate finance ladder than I previously thought. That, and the work was a bit mundane and didn't take a lot of critical thinking. So, about a year and a half ago, I started learning how to write python and SQL, and started brushing up on my statistics. After around 9  months of doing so, I decided I needed a bootcamp to better understand ML models and get a more holistic, immersive experience. I researched top bootcamps in my city and applied to the two best ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was accepted to one and enrolled in it. The experience was wonderful. I was able to meet people from all different backgrounds: medical, CS, data analysts, etc. The 3 month course covered various topics including data analysis and visualization, statistics and probability, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, big data and AWS, and lightly touched on other topics such as deep learning, graph theory, AB testing, NLP, dimensionality reduction, etc. I also learned a lot of other useful skills and technologies such as Git, Docker, Unix, Web Scraping, and noSQL, . 

&amp;#x200B;

The best part about the course is that every new algorithm we learned began with the math and theory behind it. Our instructors actually walked us through it extensively, and gave me a much better understanding of what each of them is doing under the hood. For easier algorithms, they would have exercises where they gave us an object skeleton in which we would have to (with occasional help from instructors) code out from scratch what an algorithm was doing when we fit it to the data. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do have to say a huge drawback to bootcamps is that they are fast paced, and you only brush the tip of the topics you cover. It's on you as a student in your free time and after you graduate to dig in deeper to the material to gain a better understanding of the topic. However, the best thing about this bootcamp was that I learned how to learn new things. I can now tackle new models and frameworks I haven't seen before and begin to understand them much more quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took 2 months and over 100 applications, but after several interviews, I received three offers and accepted one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what the investment looks like:

Old Salary: $65,000

Bootcamp cost: $16,000

Lost wages (based on previous salary): $30,000

New Salary: $110,000

So I will be recouping my investment and then some in my first six months!

&amp;#x200B;

My take on bootcamps is that they are not created equally. I really think the top bootcamps are worth the investment, and the others are a crap shoot. I had a friend go through another bootcamp, and after 4 months he is still looking for a position. He is beginning to apply to data engineering and data analyst jobs at this point. Also, you get out what you put in to it. I spent a lot of late nights and weekends continuing my education with the extra material they provided us. I think that helped a lot, especially when it came to my interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, I still consider myself junior and I have a lot more to learn. A bootcamp is a great base to start with, but you need to continue your education if you want to be a good data scientist. Some topics my particular bootcamp didn't cover which I have been picking up while job searching are as follows:

code performance/Big O, model deployment, Tensorflow (they only covered Keras), non-vanilla boosting algos, using models more creatively, and more complex NLP (e.g. Word2Vec)",31,13,False,self,,,,,

This process can be thought of as cooking a meal. The different types of data are the ingredients, the recipe is an algorithm which is a set of instructions of how to combine the ingredients (data), the oven is the computer which does the cooking, the data scientist is the chef and the prediction is the meal.

In order to cook this data science meal effectively the data scientist must be able to combine methods and principles from maths, statistics, software engineering and particularly machine learning. For example, skills are needed in software engineering in order to handle and store data safely. Maths and statistics are applied to critically analyse and interpret the data. Machine learning is a subsection of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This allows the automated extraction of knowledge from data. This might sound like magic, but fundamentally machine learning can only really answer 5 key questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 1: Is this person male or female? Will this customer like this product? Yes or no, machine learning answers this with classification algorithms. It takes a new data point and makes a prediction if it is A or B.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2: Is this normal? This is known as anomaly detection. Algorithms are designed to identify if something is unexpected compared to the rest of the data. This is already used in fraud detection by major banks.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 3: What is the value of this? Predicting the numerical value of something is known as regression, for example predicting the height of a child given the heights of their parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 4: How is this arranged? This question is looking at clustering data points together that have things in common and hence is known as clustering.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 5: What should I do next? This is one of the most interesting questions and is solved by algorithms that use reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is inspired by how brains respond to punishment and reward, using trial and error to find out the best solution while learning as they go.

Public interest in machine learning and data science has soared in recent years, the number of google searches for data science and machine learning have increased by 1000% since 2010. This is for several different reasons. Firstly, born digital companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon have shown the world the power of using these techniques in business. Secondly, there is a genuine need for data science to make sense of all the data collecting on hard drives all around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Data science is becoming increasingly more important in our rapidly expanding digital world. In every aspect of society from healthcare and transport to our social lives and TV habits, extensive amounts of data is being produced. Applying machine learning to this vast ocean of data allows us to extract information which influences decision making. Training a model to recognise a cancerous tumour in a MRI scan can help a doctor to identify a life threatening disease. Businesses are now able to predict when a user paying for their service is about to terminate their subscription. The applications of data science are both powerful and widespread, and it has a big role to play in our ongoing digital evolution.

&amp;#x200B;

I have found a number of helpful posts on this topic, but I was hoping you data science gurus could kindly give me your opinions on how best to learn data science given the sheer magnitude of stuff out there, and based on my current level of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

My academic and professional background: I have a Ph.D. in biochemistry, math background up to calc IV (took lin alg 20 years ago and don't remember anything beyond very basic matrix operations), have a rudimentary understanding of set theory and basic statistical methods (although statistical inference is very shaky).  I have been a business analyst in pharmaceutical market research for 4 years; before accepting this position I was starting a M.S. in Biostatistics. Those factors together make me really want to develop my quant skills to be able to clean and analyze large datasets (sales data, volume, trends in patient share, etc) to buoy my market insights, given that they're often qualitative and directional.

&amp;#x200B;

I started by downloading R and R Studio to get reacquainted with programming (I had some experience \~25 years ago with C++, QBasic, Visual Basic) and linear algebra, but after a few days of rapid progress learning basic syntax and stuff in R I'm COMPLETELY overwhelmed with the amount of instruction out there re: data science, so I really have no idea what to prioritize. Do I start by relearning linear algebra? Python? Statistical inference? Or keep getting deeper into R? At this point I would say the only thing holding me up from getting into data analysis in R is my rudimentary grasp on data cleaning and how best to store large datasets.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal situation aside (I am switching for education quality and organizational reasons), I have been thinking about something broader lately.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my interest in Data Science from the internet, from places like this subreddit to YouTube videos. I think most of you would agree that trying out being a Data Science practitioner has a low entry threshold. There are various courses and tutorials that will set you up with Keras or SciKit Learn and let you run some quick data analysis. This excited me and motivated me to choose this bachelor, which I regret now.  Whilst I was in the progress of learning that my bachelor education wouldn't set me up with the mathematical or programming rigor I expected/wanted, I came to wonder if Data Science as a specialization is a good choice for new students with now prior education. 

&amp;#x200B;

 If one of the major benefits from any technical study is the enhanced, rigorous analytical thinking, and Data Science is one of the fields where this would be a major benefit, is there a reason to 'shortcut' this process by already going into Data Science in the bachelor phase of your education, instead of just doing any technical study and then following it up with a masters in Data Science?

I'm working towards building a solid predictor (binary classification) for a Kaggle competition. I want to get some feedback on a few of the decisions I've made, since I'm fairly new to Data Science/Machine Learning and and completely new to the three technologies/techniques that I've mentioned in my title. Here's a brief walkthrough of my procedure, I've used some of the other top competitors data analysis as a benchmark so I'll leave that portion out, I can post links to their findings if requested. 

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, all of the data looks good, except classes are highly imbalanced - 90% class-0, 10% class-1...So:

1) I wanted to balance out the classes, which I accomplished using SMOTE (by way of the python library ""imblearn""). My reasoning behind this is that I'd like to tune the XGBoost model using K-Folds CV, and I'd like somewhat equal distributions between class-0 and class-1 in the train and validation sets just to make evaluation easier. I could always use the original dataset and adjust my weights accordingly, this just seemed a bit simpler.

2) I split the data into 4 folds. During each iteration I keep an eye on the error in the training set and the validation set. At the end of each run I make a prediction on the test set and store it in a matrix - so I'll end up with a 4 column matrix of predictions on the test set as a result of each training session.

Now, here are where my questions start: 

1) Everything seems to be working correctly - the validation set accuracy and training set accuracy are both high at the end of each iteration which to me means that the model is tuned well, not overfitting, etc. However, when I compare the predictions made on the test set by column, there is occasionally a pretty drastic variation between the output probabilities for the same sample. Is this a sign that parameters still need to be tweaked or is it normal? This leads me to my next question.

2) I know that K-Folds is meant to be used to tune the model rather than to actually train the model. For this reason, am I right to assume that the variation between the predictions after each run is due to me not training the algorithm on the whole training set? I'm a bit torn between one of two ideas: a) I can average the four sets of predictions after each run and use the averages to predict the class, or b) I can move on from K-Folds CV since my train and validation sets are both looking good and assume that my model's parameters are tuned effectively, and train the model on the full dataset, outputting one set of predictions based on the full train set rather than four based on fractions of the trainset.

1) there would be user friendly verbiage to help you select an algorithm (linear regression, logistics regression, k nearest neighbor, etc with better naming that you'd have for business users)

2) you upload your data. 

3) you get a response with some feedback on your features, and get feature engineering ideas for the algorithm and data you are working with.

Maybe one day it can automatically make some changes? 

4) train, test, validate, get some charts, tune parameters, etc within the ui

Once you like your results, you could deploy a rest API where you could upload more files or consume the API through an app or interface of your choice.

Version 2, this would be serverless, so you could call the necessary APIs through your notebooks.

I have extensive programming experience, and like working with data so I figured data science would be a viable option.

Where it gets confusing is that I messaged one of my instructors regarding other projects/ data sets out in the web that I can use to build up a portfolio, and he suggested Kaggle.

I have done little, if any, machine learning work in my work; from a technical perspective, my career has really been a lot of descriptive statistics with the occasional regressions, effect sizes, *t*-tests, and the rare calculus problem. I have no experience with putting machine learning models into production; the closest thing I've done to this was a class project where I learned about the bare basics of AWS. I'm one year away from finishing a M.S. in statistics and am considering doing a M.S. in computer science after.

However, what I've figured out as I progress in my career is that what I really appreciate about my job is collaborating with people. I get the most out of being able to take data and use that to propose and drive strategy in the organization in which I work. My closest colleagues have told me that I should consider a project management role; I don't mind project management, but I'm not interested in doing *just that* full-time. 

Don't get me wrong: I love what I do currently, but it's not clear to me how I should think about my future career. Too many results I've seen online talk about getting into data science to do things such as deep learning, machine learning, etc... This would be good experience to have, but I feel like I will likely be more removed from the strategic aspect, which is what really interests me. I've never had the ""Data Scientist"" title, and I've started questioning if I even want it.

I'd appreciate any advice that I get from you all.",5,5,False,self,,,,,
