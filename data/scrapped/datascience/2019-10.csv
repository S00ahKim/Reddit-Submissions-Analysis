However there is a plethora or methods to go about defining the 'optimal' value depending on the nature of the model outcome. Generally they fall into methods that look at the model's sensitivity and specificity or methods that look to maximise the p value of significant difference between the survival curves of the resulting stratas. 

Currently, i'm modeling the risk of body mass index on diagnosis of certain medical conditions through survival analysis to identify at risk individuals since the current bmi risk groupings prove inadequate to stratefy risk groups. For my purposes, i'm thinking of going with a method to maximise sensitivity with maintaining a certain threshold of specificity ,instead if going eith the standard procedure to maximise the youden index , since the cost of misclassifying in the model isn't a great deal. 

The issue im facing is how to justify the specificity threshold chosen? Or is there a better method of determining the best cut off to use for catorising bmi risk groups. Also , how to determine the number of categories?

He doesn't know anything about python, sparks, MLflow, AWS .

I have a problem that I thought people here might have some tips on how to deal with this.

The problem: I have two datasets measuring different things about the same process. Let's say that Dataset 1 contains data on a per 90 minutes basis, while Dataset 2 contain data on a per 1 minute basis. 

Their features are all different but to have some idea of size, Dataset 1 is about 1k rows while Dataset 2 reaches 90k.

The question is: I want to keep as much information as possible to eventually use in the machine learning model. What should be the correct way to combine these information?

Option 1 would be to combine the minute-based data into the 90-minute-based data, thus improving Dataset 1 with more features matching the already existing time steps. The resulting dataset would have 1k rows.

Option 2 would be to populate the big dataset 2 with more information from the small dataset. However, every sequential 90min data points would have the same information coming from the the other dataset. The resulting dataset would have 90k rows.

Both datasets contain important features about the process.

**FAQ:**

**Q**: What is the data format?

**A**: It is in Parquet format, and optimized for AWS Athena and Redshift Spectrum

**Q**: How is this dataset different from [dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/sec-public-data-bq/sec-public-dataset) hosted on Google Cloud Platform

**A**: The dataset on Google Bigquery is based on Dataset published by SEC (See next question), and is stale - the latest filing data is as of June 2018.

**Q**: How the dataset is different from dataset on SEC website

**A**: This dataset has numerous improvements over the dataset on SEC website such as:

1. Text and notes data are in full-length without truncation. The dataset published by SEC trimed footnote to 512 chars, and string value to 2048 chars only.
2. Report segment information are added to the data points directly.
3. Include the start\_date and end\_date for each data point to reflect the period more accurately.
4. Eliminated the needs to understand the convoluted XBRL convention as much as possible, so that Data Scientist can focus on the data itself to derived the value.
5. Support the tracing of the data point back to its original filing and specific section.
6. Support the tracing of data point revision.

**Q**: Do I need to download the data to query the dataset?

**A**: No, you can use the Athena or Redshift Spectrum in your AWS to query the data directly.

**Q**: What is the coverage of the data?

**A**:  As of August 31, 2019, the dataset covers:

1. All XBRL filings since 2009.
2. 12.6k companies.
3. 239.7k annual and quarterly reports.
4. 192.5 million data points.
5. 20GB+ compressed in Parquet.

An imbalanced dataset is a dataset where the number of data points per class differs drastically, resulting in a heavily biased machine learning model that wont be able to learn the minority class. When this imbalanced ratio is not so heavily skewed toward one class, such dataset is not *that* horrible, since many machine learning models can handle them. 

Nevertheless, there are some extreme cases in which the class ratio is just wrong, for example, a dataset where 95% of the labels belong to class A, while the remaining 5% fall under class B a ratio not so rare in use cases such as fraud detection. In these extreme cases, the ideal course of action would be to collect more data. 

However, this is typically not feasible; in fact, its costly, time-consuming and in most cases, impossible. Luckily for us, theres an alternative known as oversampling. Oversampling involves using the data we currently have to create more of it. 

## What is data oversampling?

Data oversampling is a technique applied to generate data in such a way that it resembles the underlying distribution of the real data. In this article, I explain how we can use an oversampling technique called **Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique** or **SMOTE** to balance out our dataset.

## What is SMOTE?

SMOTE is an oversampling algorithm that relies on the concept of nearest neighbors to create its synthetic data. Proposed back in [2002 by Chawla et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1813)., SMOTE has become one of the most popular algorithms for oversampling. 

The simplest case of oversampling is simply called oversampling or upsampling, meaning a method used to duplicate randomly selected data observations from the outnumbered class. 

Oversamplings purpose is for us to feel confident the data we generate are real examples of already existing data. This inherently comes with the issue of creating more of the same data we currently have, without adding any diversity to our dataset, and producing effects such as overfitting. 

Hence, if overfitting affects our training due to randomly generated, upsampled data or if plain oversampling is not suitable for the task at hand we could resort to another, smarter oversampling technique known as synthetic data generation.

Synthetic data is intelligently generated artificial data that resembles the shape or values of the data it is intended to enhance. Instead of merely making new examples by *copying* the data we already have (as explained in the last paragraph), a synthetic data generator *creates* data that is similar to the existing one. Creating synthetic data is where SMOTE shines.

## How does SMOTE work?

To show how SMOTE works, suppose we have an imbalanced two-dimensional dataset, such as the one in the next image, and we want to use SMOTE to create new data points.

![example of an imbalanced dataset](https://kite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/imbalance-dataset.jpg)

Example of an imbalanced dataset

For each observation that belongs to the under-represented class, the algorithm gets its K-nearest-neighbors and synthesizes a new instance of the minority label at a random location in the line between the current observation and its nearest neighbor. 

In our example (shown in the next image), the blue encircled dot is the current observation, the blue non-encircled dot is its nearest neighbor, and the green dot is the synthetic one.

![new synthetic data point generated by SMOTE](https://kite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMOTEs-new-synthetic-data-point.jpg)

SMOTEs new synthetic data point

Now lets do it in Python.



## SMOTE tutorial using imbalanced-learn

In this tutorial, I explain how to balance an imbalanced dataset using the package [**imbalanced-learn**](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

First, I create a perfectly balanced dataset and train a machine learning model with it which Ill call our **base model******. Then, Ill unbalance the dataset and train a second system which Ill call an **imbalanced model**.

Finally, Ill use SMOTE to balance out the dataset, followed by fitting a third model with it which Ill name the **SMOTEd****** model. By training a new model at each step, Well be able to better understand how an imbalanced dataset can affect a machine learning system.

### Base model

*Example code for this article may be found at the* [*Kite Blog repository*](https://github.com/kiteco/kite-python-blog-post-code/tree/master/smote)*.*

For the initial task, Ill fit a [**support-vector machine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) (SVM) model using a created, perfectly balanced dataset. I chose this kind of model because of how easy it is to visualize and understand its decision boundary, namely, the hyperplane that separates one class from the other.

To generate a balanced dataset, Ill use scikit-learns [make_classification](https://kite.com/python/docs/sklearn.datasets.make_classification) function which creates n clusters of normally distributed points suitable for a classification problem. 

My fake dataset consists of 700 sample points, two features, and two classes. To make sure each class is one blob of data, Ill set the parameter `n_clusters_per_class` to 1. 

To simplify it, Ill remove the redundant features and set the number of informative features to 2. Lastly, Ill `useflip_y=0.06` to reduce the amount of noise. 

The following piece of code shows how we can create our fake dataset and plot it using Pythons Matplotlib.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from imblearn.datasets import make_imbalance

# for reproducibility purposes
seed = 100

# create balanced dataset
X1, Y1 = make_classification(n_samples=700, n_features=2, n_redundant=0,
                            n_informative=2, n_clusters_per_class=1,
                            class_sep=1.0, flip_y=0.06, random_state=seed)

plt.title('Balanced dataset')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.scatter(X1[:, 0], X1[:, 1], marker='o', c=Y1,
           s=25, edgecolor='k', cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
plt.show()
# concatenate the features and labels into one dataframe
df = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(X1), pd.DataFrame(Y1)], axis=1)
df.columns = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'label']
# save the dataset because we'll use it later
df.to_csv('df_base.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')
```

![a perfectly balanced dataset with 1:1 ratio](https://kite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/balanced-dataset.jpg)

A balanced dataset

As you can see in the previous image, our balanced dataset looks tidy and well defined. So, if we fit an SVM model with this data (code below), how will the decision boundary look?

Since well be training several models and visualizing their hyperplanes, I wrote two functions that will be reused several times throughout the tutorial. The first one, `train_SVM`, is for fitting the SVM model, and it takes the dataset as a parameter. 

The second function, `plot_svm_boundary`, plots the decision boundary of the SVM model. Its parameters also include the dataset and the caption of the plot. 

These are the functions:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.svm import SVC


def train_SVM(df):
   # select the feature columns
   X = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'label']
   # select the label column
   y = df.label

   # train an SVM with linear kernel
   clf = SVC(kernel='linear')
   clf.fit(X, y)

   return clf


def plot_svm_boundary(clf, df, title):
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   X0, X1 = df.iloc[:, 0], df.iloc[:, 1]

   x_min, x_max = X0.min() - 1, X0.max() + 1
   y_min, y_max = X1.min() - 1, X1.max() + 1
   xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.02), np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.02))

   Z = clf.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
   Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
   out = ax.contourf(xx, yy, Z, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, alpha=0.8)

   ax.scatter(X0, X1, c=df.label, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, s=20, edgecolors='k')
   ax.set_ylabel('y')
   ax.set_xlabel('x')
   ax.set_title(title)
   plt.show()
```

To fit and plot the model, do the following:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('df_base.csv', encoding='utf-8', engine='python')
clf = train_SVM(df)
plot_svm_boundary(clf, df, 'Decision Boundary of SVM trained with a balanced dataset')
```

![decision boundary of an SVM model trained with a balanced dataset](https://kite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SVM-Trained-balanced-dataset.jpg)

Blue dots on the blue side and red dots on the red side means that the model was able to find a function that separates the classes

The image above presents the hyperplane of the base model. On it, we can observe how clear the separation between our classes is. However, what would happen if we imbalance our dataset? How would the decision boundary look? Before doing so, lets imbalance the dataset by calling the function [make_imbalance](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.datasets.make_imbalance.html) from the package, **imbalanced-learn**.

I will briefly give some background on my education before posing my question, so that it is better understood:

Maths Coursework:

This has been mostly in pure maths: topology, functional analysis, etc, but also include more applied ones(on which I have specialized for the dissertation): convex optimization, nonlinear programming, numerical analysis, linear programming, multiobjective optimization. In addition, I have right now 0 knowledge of inferential stat, but I am confident in probability theory.

Programming:

I just took a year-long course in the Bachelor, but it was mostly Mathematica and some Java, of which I remember nothing honestly. In this course, the content did not include anything of data structures or design and analysis of algorithms, nor databases management systems. I also learned Matlab on my own for implementing algorithms in the bachelor thesis.

The above background was during the Bachelor and Master's program. Now, during the Ph.D. program, I discovered that Machine Learning is the perfect mix (for me) between Nonlinear Optimization, Programming, and applications in the real world, i.e, it is both theoretically interesting and application-oriented. This is the reason why I became so excited to go to industry. Hence, I started learning things on my own(in my little free time) during the last 3 years.

A short summary of things learned:

* Python: I am comfortable implementing optimization algorithms, work with jupyter notebooks and the numpy library (in fact, I had to do this for the dissertation), and doing basic data manipulations and cleaning tasks in pandas. This I learned online, in a platform called Dataquest ([https://app.dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/)). However, I don't think I have enough knowledge to pass an interview in data structures and algorithms(see above).
* Machine Learning: I took a master level course in the topic at the uni (since I am in Germany, we don't have courses in the Ph.D., so this was all in my personal time), which I really enjoyed. Topics included: k-NN, PCA, SVM, NN, etc.
* Taking a course in Databases this semester, which focuses on SQL.
* Taking Deep Learning specialization on Coursera this semester.

Finally, I want to say that I feel totally capable of learning the topics. In fact, with time I intend to take more graduate-level courses available online(for example, Stanford CS231N, CS234, etc) because, in my opinion, online courses may not be rigorous enough.

Somehow everyone I meet knows a little something about data science and thinks they're a pro. Few weeks ago I was at my dad's Indian friend's place for dinner and he told me about how his 17 year old son ""developed his own Artificial intelligence"". He proceeded to show it off to us. The kid basically just copy pasted a GitHub repo. I mean it's great and everything but definitely not worth showing off an hour's worth of work.

I hate the fact that I am associated with the thousands of people who see a problem and then just throw a bunch of models at the data to see what sticks. What about hyperparameters? Throw a bunch of hyperparameters at it and pick the one with the best results. Boom. Data scientist. Gah. It really makes me cringe when people do that. 

Please. Take the time to really understand the problem. Understand what your input is and how features relate to each other. What is your output and how you would split the data? (These are the questions you need to ask before you do anything). EDA is where you should be spending the bulk of your time so you don't need to waste a lot of time throwing a bunch of models at the problem. 

There's also the onslaught of people who will post ""how do I study to be a data scientist"" one day and then tell people they're a data scientist after watching 5 YouTube videos the next day. On the other hand, knowing linear algebra and statistics doesn't automatically mean you're a ""good"" data scientist. It actually doesn't mean anything at all if you don't know how to apply the things you learn in practice. The more I learn about ""data science"" the less I feel I actually know -- there is just such a vast amount of knowledge.

Each one has quit or moved classes. Trilogy has maintained that these adjustments allow for us to get a broader teaching style...

When you are learning and have a new teacher rotating basically every session, they have no idea what the instructor before them has delved into and what style they are teaching from.

A few of the teachers would literally stand up with the physically printed solved code and just read from the code while typing it back into their computer. With one teacher, the code wouldnt work and he basically said You get the jist, but we have to move on for times sake...

Since we are so behind in the curriculum, they have added in Friday night sessions (on top of our 3 other days a week). I understand that I am making an investment in my future, but some balance is needed in life. We still have homework and group projects outside of class. I would say that 80% of us also have full-time jobs.

When we spoke to the administrator about how difficult the situation was, they basically said it has been really hard on us, too, with all of the changes. YOU ARENT PAYING TO LEARN... you are BEING PAID to do your job. Sorry if you feel inconvenienced.

We are happy to invite you to our brand new reddit community:  [**r/VisualSchool**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisualSchool/) . Here you can learn coding, design, marketing, dev ops, security and many other skills. We want to radically improve the online learning experience by providing a visual map of knowledge trough our innovative learning platforms.

How can we improve our learning platform and help you to learn faster?

Leave us feedback on r/VisualSchool

# Why Visual School?

 **Because learning is slow**  Our current experience learning online is very rough. We are forced to spend lots of time searching for the right material. We are forced to drain lots of energy just to understand the basics.

 **Because we lose focus**  We start learning one thing and then the next few hours we are all over the web trying to put the puzzle together. Its like going downstairs to dump the trash and returning several hours later after you were attacked by a grizzly bear in Las Vegas.

 **Because we are missing know-how**  On a daily basis we start reading some tutorial and then we find lots of strange unfamiliar concepts. All these gaps in knowledge prevent us from learning fast. Worse they divert our attention away from the main topic.

# How will we learn on Visual School?

 **Elastic lessons**  All the tutorials in Visual School are optimized to be stretchy. Depending on how skilled you are you can adjust each part of the lesson to give you more or less content. Users ranging from complete beginners up to experts can consume the same set of tutorials adjusted to their own needs.

 **Speed reading**  All our tutorials will be optimized for speed reading. Our approach is to integrate carefully selected and designed graphics and animations. It will look and feel like a hybrid between text, slideshows and video all optimized for learning fast. The accent is on quality not quantity.

 **Learning map**  Think of it as a subway map. Our aim is to map all the important destinations and focus your attention on what makes the biggest impact in your daily life as a professional. This map will give you awareness of the big picture.

 **Learning goals**  You will be able to setup goals and our platform will help you plan ahead a faster route towards your professional goals. We encourage exploration in all ways and forms, all while maintaining a clear deadline and end-goal.

 **Nano Lessons**  For every new unfamiliar concept you discover in the lesson you will have a mini lesson about it one click away. It will help you focus and stay on track without feeling lost.

# What will Visual School be?

 Visual School is the platform where you can study matching your own level of experience

 Visual School maintains your focus while studying a certain subject.

 Visual School fills in the gaps of knowledge right on the spot.

# Who is the audience for Visual School?

 In this current group we invited only profiles that are either strong developers or strong designers. This selection is a good representation of the audience we are targeting. We intend to reach the global market of developers in the early phase. Our first iteration of content will be about programming.

The ultimate goal of Visual School is to reduce the time spent learning and to increase the time spent coding meaningful projects. Current generation of tutorials does a decent job. The next generation of tutorials will kick ass! We want to lead the way towards this future.

My understanding from the episode is that the guest argued that a reinforcement learning model always results in an unbiased model (or minimally biased model) given the correct constraints (around 30:00 - 31:30 in the podcast). My first question is if this is possible and how do you know if you have given the correct constraints without having to burn resources trying different solutions? Or is this the only way?  


Furthermore, I have a two more questions regarding reinforcement learning of which I have yet to find answers that i'm happy with (perhaps i'm formulating the questions wrong).   


1) If I use a biased training set while doing imitation learning, can it increase the learning time?  
2) Are there any heuristics for creating a good reward function? In the podcast they talk about a taxi routing problem. My question is then, when the guest says that his company solves the routing problem using a reinforcement learning model, what do they really solve? Is it total time in car per passenger, total miles driven by the taxis, the minimum climate impact and so on? How do you go about formulating your reward function? The training time makes it hard to try many different reward functions which is why i'm looking for tips.   


Note: Exactly what the guest solves is not important to me, but kind of illustrates what I am asking.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Instead of giving people food, or paying school fees we give people electronic money to their mobile phones. They know far better what they need than we do. 

In Somalia, there's no ID system so when we register people for a year-long programme we take their names, phone numbers etc. But there's no way for us to definitively determine if someone has registered twice.

Somali names are long (4 names) and spelt more on judgment than convention, so names aren't consistent. Plus, people often have more than one phone number. 

We've tried using fingerprint biometrics, but it was slow, expensive, inaccurate and we're not happy with the data protection risks (certainly the benefits don't outweigh them).

We want to start using fuzzy matching over multiple data points to determine duplicates. Once we have a shortlist, we can use the photos to make a fairly accurate judgement. We have around 75,000 people's records. 

So, what are people's thoughts?

1) How do we do this? Off the shelf package? Consultancy? Researcher?

 2) there isnt much of an industry here, really

I always include a cover letter that Ive perfected based on feedback and lots of Reddit career help research and a stellar reference letter from a major employer (working on getting more reference letters). 


Another thing seems to be that most positions are looking for really experienced analysts. Is there another title I should be looking at? Ive even applied to multiple associate and junior positions to no avail. 


I am in the process of trying to begin working on some projects since Im wondering if maybe thats the issue? I dont have a portfolio or anythingI guess I just get confused as to what that would look like and worry it would do more harm than good (would it look too elementary or something to that degree).

No one can deny it, security threats have increased dramatically over the last few years. Record global ransomware attacks have made the headlines recently, focusing the attention once more on the issue of data protection.

The truth is, threats are everywhere and disasters can strike anytime. Business owners have to consider this as a high risk for their organizations and be proactive. No organization is too small to be targeted by a cyber criminal. Moreover, business data is in danger no matter where its stored. It doesnt matter if its on-premises or in the cloud.

**Yes, Office 365 is Secure. But Are Users Playing It Safe?**

Microsoft invests a lot in securing its products. Did you know that Office 365 is used by more than 100 million subscribers around the world every month?  This means tens of millions of users are connecting to Microsofts online applications around the clock from everywhere in the world. This is only possible because of a highly available infrastructure and protection at all levels. Office 365 services are secure and always on. Access is carefully segregated so organizations only have access to their own data.

Users. Remember, human error is involved in most data breaches: a users device is stolen, a weak password is hijacked, a malicious attachment is accidentally opened from a phishing email, an administrator misconfigures the system and exposes data, a computer has not been patched the list goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Human Error Is Involved In Most Data Breaches***

&amp;#x200B;

Some users received phishing emails with an infected attachment. Because phishing emails are always sent under a legitimate name, its a lot easier to trick users to open a malicious document.

Unaware the attachment was malicious, a number of people opened it and enabled macros that automatically encrypted their files, including business data. By the time Microsoft had started blocking the malicious file, many subscribers had already been infected and their data was locked.

 

**Office 365 is Used On Mobile Devices, a High Risk for Business Data**

One of the advantages of Office 365 is that its apps and data can be used on tablets and smartphones. Information like contacts and documents are synced between the devices and the Office 365 servers. But theres a small problem here. Mobile devices can be easily lost or stolen.

In a recent survey by Lookout, an American security company, 60% of IT admins reported at least one smartphone had been either lost or stolen in the last year. In some cases, the thief wiped out the device intentionally and business data were also deleted on the server-side. The only way to recover deleted information was to restore it from a backup. Mobile devices also carry higher risk because users can download and install applications that no one knows about.

 

# 83% of companies have released applications they know are unsafe.

#  

**Backup is an Alternative to Costly Office 365 Archiving Features SMBs Cannot Afford**

Microsoft gives its customers several payable options to archive data (Exchange Online Archiving), manage document versioning (SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business) and retain deleted items for a desired amount of time.

**Cloud Backup Results in A Better ROI Compared with Traditional Backup**

Traditional backup requires the user to add extra servers, configure libraries and move tapes or other media to dierent locations. It requires some expertise so companies must either hire professionals or deal with a managed service provider (MSP).

**Backup Keeps Businesses Compliant**

The most obvious reason to back up data is to restore information thats been deleted or compromised in some way. But another equally important reason is to keep businesses in compliance with the growing number of laws regulating how they ensure information is available.

Companies working in the healthcare, finance industry or public trade, for instance, are subject to mandatory government and industry regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), HIPAA and GLBA. While its not specifically explained how to retain data, businesses will achieve compliance with an effective backup solution that keep the records for the specified period.

Due to re-org, I (data analyst) was pulled into our data science team. This should be a dream come true, considering I'm doing a part-time master to break into the field, but I felt disillusioned?

The team works on prediction problems from image or text using CNN and NLP. As cool as it sounds, it's almost too...cookie-cutter? We literally look at the problem, find a research paper that addresses the problem, and implement the code. Time was spent on writing the pre-processing code and dealing with processing speed issues (set up cloud, now code needs to work on cloud, ...etc). There's not a lot of thinking going on, if at all. 

That said, it's everything a data scientist-wannabe can dream of? My ear should get an orgasm hearing ""using Python to build pipeline and run spark and train a CNN and NLP to predict x on a cloud platform"". If I stick it through, CNN and NLP should also make me very in-demand for the next 5-10 years?

In comparison, my previous position was a research consulting role, where my manager would ask questions and I'll have to answer it with or without the existence of data. Most time was spent thinking about the problem, making careful assumptions, and draw conclusions using limited amount of information. Lots of thinking and exchanging ideas was involved in a project.

An example project was mapping consumers geographically and try to categorize them (apply median HH-income, median house value, proximity to high-end shopping mall...etc.). I'll never get it exactly right, but throughout the process we learn a lot about our consumers.

It sort of dawn upon me that I went for a master so I can answer more complex questions. Although not necessarily using machine learning, my old team was answer questions that are way more interesting. That said, I'm not sure if it's just because I don't have the CS chop yet and when I do work will become more interesting (will it)?

I'm currently a senior analyst (really the only analyst) at a smallish company. I've taught myself python over the last two years, and have adequate math/stats chops. I have degrees in economics and finance (just to make the point my math is on par). Ive been through Thinkful's data science course and use python at work, though mostly for data cleaning and automating certain tasks. 

Long story short I have been through a first round interview at a company that wants to stand up a Data Science department. One more to go and they like me a lot so far.  I'd be the first Data Scientist and have a team of data engineers there. I want to make the jump in to the field, but am unsure if this is a wise way to go about it. I thought there would at least be a bit more senior Data Scientist to kind of look over my shoulder or fill me in on best practices. I don't mind learning a tremendous amount  in a short time, but I'm a bit concerned because I haven't really worked in a legit data science environment. Basically I don't want to mislead anybody and I'm not 100% sure what will be expected. 

As I write I realize I need to dig in to their expectations, but should I be looking more for a role where I'd have a bit more mentorship initially? Can any working Data Scientists offer their thoughts?

I remember some redditor once submitted a site he wrote, that basically generates a big info about a given username on reddit - age, sex, family, location, hobbies and more. It was just amateur site with open data form one source but people in comments got pretty spooked that algoriphm knows this about them. But they mostly presume they stay anonimous, it's just username after all, but well...

Big companies potentionally know shitton about you(unless you're super cautious to the degree of paranoia), you agreed to their terms and licenses, well who reads these? But by shitton I mean A REAL SHITTON. Including: sexual orientation, political desposition, porn you watch, where you frequent, your spending habits, whether you're on facebook while at work, if you have any extremist views and whatnot. Basically any shit you write on big platforms traces back to you with algorithms in right hands. Even if you use vpn, there are \~60 markers(browser, screen resolution, fonts, etc.) by which a special alorithm may identify you and put a unique label on you which then will trace you to all your public accounts.

While mostly that's used to market and sell you shit you (don't) need, that's also info your insurance company, potential employer or bank might ask to analyze before giving rate/hiring/setting your credit limit. I don't think many people understand that if you have a phone, several social medias(especially linked together) and don't use vpn and deanonymizers, basically everything you write is out in the open for people who can analyze it. Even instagram stories don't dissapear, software can detect some info on it and attach a tag to you.

I learned most of that from [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLydE1UCvA) with one data scientist who specializes on those kind of things, unfortunately it's in russian. 

I don't even know if me having a reddit registered on gmail means my gmail is publicly linked to this account and all info on it, or maybe a mere fact of using Chrome is enough for someone to link my account to everything else.

Im a 40 year old career changer that made it into a data science / data engineering job.  I spent most of my career after undergrad in commercial construction as a project manager and cost estimator.  Around age 36 I started a part-time MBA which ended up being focused on data analytics, since I found I had a passion for it.  After finishing that I quit my job and went to a full-time DS bootcamp. After bootcamp I ended up with three job offers at 3 large consulting firms, but only one was hands on technical data science, so I took it.  Ive been here for about 4 months and love it.  In my time here Ive gotten an AWS arch associate cert and Agile certification.  Im on my first project and am building experience in that regard as well.  

I love learning and I keep going with open courses (not consistently though) but Ive been wondering about getting more certs or degrees.  I also get about $5K a year from my employer to spend on education (Im not doing this JUST b/c I have the moneyjust an aside).  Ive been thinking of doing an MS in CS, or MS in stats.  Also, I do have an interest in geography and geospatial work so have been looking at MS in those fields as well.  Alternatively, I could just work on more industry certifications like AWS machine learning or Big Data.  Im wondering if a (part-time) MS CS is worth it for me (I have a BS undergrad in Architectural planning from a top school but it was light on math). 

Im also wondering, being that Im a bit late to the game at 40yo, whether going further into a technical, hands on route is my best choice career wise.  It seems like theres going to be someone younger and better at CS/Stats/Math than me, and that my strengths may lie elsewhere like strategy or management.  

Bottom line is Im super happy I was able to make this career change into something I really enjoy and have interest in but I also wonder if getting more technical training is my best bet, and if so, should I think about getting another part-time masters.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

* [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) - quick and awesome EDA tool to run on a dataframe to get descriptive stats on each feature and does quick and dirty correlation matrices to quickly get a handle on a new data set. Can have performance issues for huge DFs.

I am wanting to a method in order correctly classify the row based on its description.

So a model based on the above dataset should take a description it has not seen before and correctly classify that item for instance: given the input `iphone 11 $999.99` it should give the output `Electronic, Cell Phone, Apple.`

I am currently only planning on using the description to classify as a first step to keep it simple, however there are other columns such as who supplied the item that could help classify, for instance if the item was supplied by `Apple`  
 or `AT&amp;T`  
 it is more likely to be classified as a `Electronic, Cell Phone,...`

I am thinking to implement a neural network to do this.

&gt;2. I need a way to convert the text into a numerical format. There seems to be a few options out there like word2vec, but I am not sure what is the best option.

A couple of months ago, I mastered out of my physics PhD and am now in the job hunt. A data science career has recently piqued my interest because I love math and computational work in general, and I would love the opportunity to apply those skills to a variety of real world problems. However, aside from functional programming (Python, MATLAB) and some knowledge of regression analysis, I don't really have experience in the field because my background was as an experimental physicist who didn't really deal with high data volumes like high-energy physicists do. I think that showed when I made a final interview round at a company for a data scientist position but ultimately didn't get the job. Therefore, I'm looking for ways to build my skills so I can be better equipped to figure out if this is a field I'd want to pursue and if I can get a job in it.

I know of Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera, which would be a great start since I know nothing about machine learning. What else do people recommend, both in terms of coursework and other things I can do (portfolio building, etc.)?

I'll try to keep this reasonably concise.

I work in a data team that does data collection and quality control for a huge array of ocean floats. We collect, process, and manage huge quantities of data (geochemical data, pressure, salinity, etc), ranging from ocean surface to 6km deep. I mainly work in creating software that corrects and adjusts data if we find that an instrument on board a float is misreading consistently or drifting.

I am contracted to work with this team for a year, and then I wanted to return to university to study machine learning. I am by no means massively experienced in this area, my only experience is using some basic ML algorithms in epidemiology (finding force of infection, number if diseases in a population etc), but I really enjoyed it, which is why I wanted to pursue it. The team have decided that they really like me, and want to keep me on after my contract expires, and so have offered to fund an MSc and PhD in machine learning if I complete a project(s) for them whilst at university. I'm happy to do this, as I love atmospheric physics as well as software engineering, so this strikes a very pleasant balance for me.

I need to write a few possible project proposals for my team leader, who will read them over and then talk to professors at potential universities. Problem is, I'm not really experienced enough in ML (yet) to really know what the possibilities are, and I'm pretty new to data science. My team leader is hoping there are applications in automating some of the quality control processes the data scientists here have to do.

Really, I'm just looking for a bit of guidance from the ML community - is there somewhere I should be looking first, or anything that springs to anyone's mind?

This would really mean a lot to me if I managed to get this funding. My background is pretty spot on for machine learning (first class BSc in computer science and statistics, worked as a statistician for a pharmaceutical company, worked as a software engineer for a robotics company, now working for a data company), I just would love to get a formal education in it AND be able to apply it to environmental science. Would be pretty nice to be able to pursue a ML education without putting myself in horrendous debt.

I have a meeting with some of my superiors and IT people today where we will be discussing software they want me to use. Having never used Tableau, I am not too sure what all of its capabilities are. Frankly, I would prefer to just R and Python for everything, but I think they will need some persuasion as to why they should let me stick with the tools I'm comfortable with and where exactly Tableau falls short of Python/R.

Assumptions:  
1. You are a one man team  
2. Data pipelines exist but raw data that comes in needs cleaning.  


Personally for me I would say at least a full work week(which is 4 days of time)  in order to be able to come to some conclusion:   
1 to 2  full days to clean the data and incorporate the cleaning in the scheduled jobs  
1 day to explore the data to see if there is any easy to spot relationships. This is where I look at correlation matrices   
and try out stuff like logistic regression and random forest to get an idea of feature importance.  
1-2 days to play with model selection and hyperparameter tuning  
1 day to try to scale up the model a bit (and sometimes here I noticed that my project sucks at scaling up and I need to do something)

I'm a final year BSc Computer Science Student, choosing a final year project to work on.  I've narrowed it down to 3 data-science related options, as I wish to develop skills that can be proven to employers, or potentially MSc admissions (DS/ML).

**I would really appreciate it if you could lend me an opinion as to which one you think would be the best option?**

**Potentially useful context:**

* We are allowed to implement 3rd party packages &amp; libraries
* It would be beneficial if the project has a lot of current material as research is a strong element
* I study NLP, Algorithmic Game Theory, Information Retrieval &amp; Network Security as part of my course
* I want to make something robust (we have to present it to companies &amp; peers)
* I would like to use Python, though I'm open to other languages
* I've recently started self-education in my spare time i.e. Kaggle, online courses

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Kaggle GUI:**An Assistive System for Preparing Entries to Kaggle Machine Learning Competitions

GUI to prep Kaggle competition entries. Basic functions include importing dataset, dividing into training/validation subsets, pre-processing &amp; extracting features using different methods depending on the problem domain, classifying  
the extracted features using at least two classifiers, evaluation by statistical significance test. In addition to a GUI  
for model/parameter settings, results visualising and saving

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Sentiment Analysis :**twitter feed/document positivity etc

A lot of scope IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Building a real-life 'Recommender system'**

Recommenders are ubiquitous i.e. Amazon, movie review sites. Now it's possible to implement your own recommender and test it on real users e.g. Plista's API  allows you to recommend news articles to millions of users (http://orp.plista.com/documentation). This project is challenging in that it requires a sophisticated recommender system (to perform well against alternative implementations) and solid software engineering (to avoid being kicked out if the response is too slow).

This is a great knowledge base which has not gone under-appreciated, THANKS IN ADVANCE!

I have started to send out letters two weeks ago and I already have had several job interviews for data scientist positions. However I feel it's pretty to hard to understand on what kind of level the companies are doing data science. In other words, sometimes data scientist positions are actually for data analyst or a BI expert. Nevertheless I'm at the point where I can choose between three jobs.

One is at a (larger) commercial company (company A). I will mostly do ''data science'' related to customer experience. I already went to two job interviews. The job itself is not bad I guess, but it's more boring I would say than the other two. The plus side is that it's pretty close to my house and they do have options for trainings but not really data science trainings.

One is at a smaller company (company B) that uses satellite imagery and ML to help farmers in Africa. This actually is the most closely related to my expertise. I did an intern for a humanitarian organization where I made a similar model. In other words it's more closely related to my interest. However I do expect I won't be able to learn as much as with company C.

The last company (company C) is a IT consultancy company. I would have lessons each friday with regard to machine learning. 4 days a week I will be working as a IT consultant for this company. Even though it sounds pretty interesting I do wonder how much more I would learn from this training. Since I had the idea (based on the first interview) that the techniques you would learn are far to complex for the problems you would have to solve at the companies you are sent to.

All in all I'm having serious stress these days about choosing and making a decision. I know I should not, but I feel the pressure of choosing pretty bad. Especially since I already have to make a decision about company A. While I have final interviews with company B and C this week.

Could anybody give me some advice or tips for choosing my first job in the Data Science field.

However, after finding the work in corporate finance (FP&amp;A) unappealing (think: monthly reporting routines, manual database/application fixes on back-end processes, and very little actual analysis and insight) I have decided that a career as a data scientist or data statistician may provide the intellectual stimulation and high impact career I am looking for.

However, I havent taken a calc class since I passed my ap calc exam in senior year of high school (~ 14 years ago) and a stats 101 class in my freshmen curriculum in college.  I have no coding or computer science coursework either.  


Considering the above, I have two inquiries:

1. I am unclear as to the % breakdown in responsibilities for a ""typical"" data scientist. I know what I want is a career that more closely resembles the non-stop learning, theorizing, and critical thinking that occurs in college coursework. However, I have heard from another source that over 80% of a data scientists work is cleaning and processing unstructured data. Is that true for all roles in the ""data scientist"" umbrella?


2. What coursework and degree should i go after, considering I have no quantitative background but also know I need the academic rigor to get a data science position that works with far more of the front end theorizing and problem solving framework rather than data cleaning or back end system architecture?

Areas where we've found it useful are biomedical, drone imagery, satellite imagery, retail, and autonomous mobility.

As already prominent in the ImageNet challenge, the state of the art is using synthetic data to gain higher accuracy. \[ [https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet) \]

As I am still learning data science so there may be some mistakes in my implementation/ approach and I highly appreciate your opinions, points, suggestions, modifications.

I am working on a leading financial services company and for their premium users, I need to implement personalized news.

Through I have found out some idea how to approach the problem, I don't know whether my idea is actually the workable solution or not.

**Problem Statement**: Recommend user's news articles.

**Data**: user's personal information such as age, login time, portfolio information, topics that users have high affinity to.  ( this is still WIP still suggestions on data would be beneficial)

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution**: 

Steps

1. ***Finding readers with similar interests:***

As we have mixed data we will be using [hierarchical clustering algorithm using the Gower](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/15313/260511) similarity coefficient.

It will help to group similar users who have similar tastes.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** ***Topic modeling***

 To understand news articles we will use the [LDA algorithm](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/news4u-recommend-stories-based-on-collaborative-reader-behavior-9b049b6724c4) to identify topics in news.

 We can also use it to understand how much a news article is relevant to the topic.

 To identify the diversity of topics I will use Jaccard similarity. as we do not want many topics and similar topics.

&amp;#x200B;

For mapping news with users, we will use the number of clicks of the user on particular news containing the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** ***Recommendation***

As we have a Group of clusters which has information about their affinity toward the topic, 

we can find out similar news article which is similar to the topic using [cosine similarity](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/cosine-similarity/) and recommend that article to the user group.

Like with any startup, it has its problems. But like any hype around AI, everyone thinks everything can be done. 

When I first started, there was no training whatsoever. The problem is not only with poor management but also poor collection of data. Since start of the year, company has wanted to venture into NLP (and computer vision), but to date after going rounds in circles we only have limited number of documents to work with. They don't have an exact procedure of doing things, and with limited data its also equally hard for me to do things. 

Sometimes they change objectives extremely fast. Today I could be working on some computer vision problems, next week they could be asking me how far we are into it. The following week they might think we are wasting time and change their objectives. Either they have no concept that each problem is not trivial or I am dumb 

Each time I change to work on a different problem, I have to switch context which is taxing on its own. This has happened many times. They are eager to launch a product sure, but without thinking if first of all the problem has a good solution. 

Its reaching a breaking point for me as I feel I am getting nowhere with my career. Can anyone tell me how to deal with it? I am not sure if its weakness on my part that these are common occurrences in startups data science job or not. I am thinking of leaving and have X months saved up so financially wise its not too big of an issue though if i stay unemployed too long It does. For context, I have a masters in statistics as well if that helps.

Have about a decade of experience in some-version-of-Data-Science (counting my first role which was using SPSS in a lab in undergrad).  Undergrad gave me a strong stats background, but I'm self-taught with coding.  I've been doing Python data science for about 6 years now, and I think I'm pretty good at Data Scientist Code Practices (packaging things into neat &amp; tidy functions, descriptive names, even fallen in love with Type Annotations), and am very good with pandas &amp; friends, and SQL (or at least the retrieval side).  

Buut I don't really have much Proper Software Engineering experience - I've written simple pipelines for clients (one's running to this day, and it emails me every day about it =D ) but it was always kind of ad-hoc.  I never really learned proper stuff about Testing, or even what else I don't know that maybe I'd need to.  I also find it kind of panic-inducing to touch live infrastructure, but hopefully I'd get used to that  =D  I do know my way conceptually around the different AWS &amp; GCP services, though.

I do like the Data Science part best, but honestly I legitimately enjoy designing data cleaning schemes too.  I wouldn't necessarily mind if that was my primary duty.  From what I've read about what ML Engineers do, sounds like I wouldn't necessarily mind that either (at least the parts that were familiar - setting up scripts to retrain models and serve up predictions and such).  Plus, again, seems like there's just a lot more work out there (especially remote) for these than for Data Science.

Any tips or resources to recommend for either?  Most of the things I found seem to assume that you're a Software Engineer, haven't really found anything that's aimed at people who are starting from the Data Science side.  

Also, any advice as to which might be easier or more fun or just overall better move from Data Science?  Or just any stories to share from/about people who have made that move?

Other assorted questions: 

1. What, if anything, should I know about Java?  I find those Spark stacktraces to be kind of terrifying - as a proper Data Engineer, would I imagine they'd come up a lot? 
2. Should I pick up Scala?  For one?  For either?  PySpark always seemed a little behind.  I do like Functional Programming a lot - I picked up Clojure on a whim a few years back, and I basically write Python as Functional as possible.

Data science has become the standard solving problem framework for the academia and the industry and its going to be like that for a while. But we need to remember where we are coming from, who we are and where we are going.

&gt;How many yards will an NFL player gain after receiving a handoff?  
American football is a complex sport. From the 22 players on the field to specific characteristics that ebb and flow throughout the game, it can be challenging to quantify the value of specific plays and actions within a play. Fundamentally, the goal of football is for the offense to run (rush) or throw (pass) the ball to gain yards, moving towards, then across, the opposing teams side of the field in order to score. And the goal of the defense is to prevent the offensive team from scoring.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In the National Football League (NFL), roughly a third of teams offensive yardage comes from run plays.. Ball carriers are generally assigned the most credit for these plays, but their teammates (by way of blocking), coach (by way of play call), and the opposing defense also play a critical role. Traditional metrics such as yards per carry or total rushing yards can be flawed; in this competition, the NFL aims to provide better context into what contributes to a successful run play.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;As an armchair quarterback watching the game, you may think you can predict the result of a play when a ball carrier takes the handoff - but what does the data say? In this competition, you will develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen. You'll be provided game, play, and player-level data, including the position and speed of players as provided in the NFLs Next Gen Stats data. And the best part - you can see how your model performs from your living room, as the leaderboard will be updated week after week on the current seasons game data as it plays out.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Deeper insight into rushing plays will help teams, media, and fans better understand the skill of players and the strategies of coaches. It will also assist the NFL and its teams evaluate the ball carrier, his teammates, his coach, and the opposing defense, in order to make adjustments as necessary.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the winning model will be provided to the NFLs Next Gen Stats group to potentially share with teams. You could help the NFL Network generate models to use during games, or for pre-game/post-game breakdowns.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Im looking for some insights around how should we organise a data science team.

Currently our team is still at its infancy, founded exclusively to support our parent business companies which have multiple portfolios in different industries.

Portfolio example would be healthcare and fast moving consumer goods.

The data science team is responsible to pitch data science use cases for the business units.

If the business sees potential, the team is then responsible to implement a POC to demonstrate value. Typically the POC culminates into an interactive Power BI dashboard for the business users to consume.

Our main concern moving forward is, after we have a few successful data science products, how should we structure the team such that we can 
1. Implement POCs
2. Support productionalized data science products (enhancement and maintenance)

Task number 1 of implementing POCs still remains the teams objective.

But at the same time, the current team structure is not ready to do both - implement new POCs and also do continuous IT support for productionalized products.

Id be appreciative to know how others are organising their data science team between creative experimentation &amp; also continuous product enhancements and supports.

It feels like you're a jack of all traits, master of none. I have been applying to internships and of the few times I do get through to the interview stage I noticed the problem with a DS undergrad program.

1. No one wants a Data Science undergrad intern. They want people with at least a MSc or PhD for DS intern roles since it's so math/stats/research/ML heavy and undergrads don't have that level of understanding of those subjects. Very few companies have DS internships for undergrads.
2. Companies would rather have Statistics/Math/CS students fill the DS intern roles than actual DS students since most of them know at least one useful language/software (R/Python/MATLAB). Stats/Math undergrads have much stronger foundation in Stats/Math and CS are much better at writing solid algo's w/ better design.
3. Final and most important point: DS undergrads are jack of all traits, Master of NONE. I applied to SWE roles (which I did mostly self study for), quant trader/researcher and few DS roles. I did notice the huge disparity in SWE skills and advanced stats skills I'm missing. My first interview I totally bombed because I though as a decent DS student with 3.5+ GPA I should be able to solve simple stats/CS question, but most of the questions asked weren't even part of my curriculum.

In hindsight I wouldn't choose DS major again and I'm really disappointed how useless it feels. I would have much rather went the CS/Stats/Math major route with some DS courses on the side.

304,datascience,t5_2sptq,2019-10-12,2019,10,12,3,dgjcw2,self.datascience,Question regarding database design for research team -please help,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/dgjcw2/question_regarding_database_design_for_research/,Fishparkay,1570819267,"Hi Reddit world,

A little background about myself...My background is in epidemiology and biostatistics. I have about 10 years of experience working within this sector at progressive levels. The institution is divided into a pre-clinical side and a clinical side. Much of my past experiences have been providing quantitative analysis to aid in improving the performance of care teams, improve quality of care, improve patient and staff experience, and of course reduce costs.

Now, I recently (very recently) started a job as an analytics manager at a psych research institution. I'll try to break the organization fairly simple -- there is a clinical side and a pre-clinical side. On the clinical side, there are clinicians mainly doing paper-based assessments ( that I hope to transition to a digital collection tool at some point) which clinical coordinators (fresh college grads) are manually entering in the information into excel spreadsheets. For some studies, data is double entered ( 2 coordinators entering information, and appending the info into one spreadsheet). There are about 7 coordinators, each working on various projects that the others are not involved in. There are more issues, but this is just an idea.

One clinician prefers to use RedCAP, so there is not common collaboration with respect to data collection across investigators.

Clinicians will then either export from RedCAP or import the excel files to SPSS in order to conduct the analyses.

I recently took a look at the data that has been collected, and it is in bad shape, to say the least. No data validation, no integrity. No uniform coding structure across the board (i.e. one study has a coding scheme, another completely different. There is an ID system in place for each study, however, it is not consistent because historically the ID was not used--and even now it isn't inputted consistently. Some worksheets in excel have about ten separate tables within that should be their on spreadsheets. Free text notes have been placed all over the spreadsheet in some places ( as im sure the coordinators/ clinicians have no idea about structured data.

Not the pre-clinical side would like to access this data and/or easily view summaries of this data at any given time (however this should be de-identified on the clinical side for security reasons).

There is also a wetlab, so we would like to track samples connected to the study participants as well.

* Now I would love to have a repository for structured, filtered data that has already been processed ready for Adhoc queries.
* I would love to have a data collection system in place that is easy to use for the coordinators, and that has data validation checks so they enter in the right information. Possibly some sort of form-based entry system
* I would love for whatever database system is in place to allow for easy export to SPSS since the clinicians are comfy with that software and I dont want to reinvent the will. Most use SPSS on the clinical side for analysis, with R being the preferred package on the pre-clinical side.
* My initial thought was to  

   * clean all the data so it is structured in a correct manner ( just the thought seems tedious because not only is the current data protocol all over the place, we dont want to lose historical data for studies that have already been completed. We would have to migrate to the new format to include it newly designed database.
   * Attempt to link all tables created on the clinical side, preclinical, and lab via a study ID/participant ID and possibly create a form for end-users to select the variables they would like to create a dataset from in order to complete the analysis they desire to perform.
   * I would like the system implemented to allow me to create a live dashboard for a few metrics for the director to access at any time ( I was thinking possibly a Rshiny App?). Probably would need a login/authenticator along with it.
   * I am also thinking about future scalability ( this is why using MS Access to solve the problem concerns me)

My question to you--how should I best attack this problem and what is the optimal solution? I am able to use the coordinators to clean data, so that part won't be as tedious, but I also want a solution that is the simplest and less difficult for me to implement. I would appreciate any and all advice!

I'm part of a group developing a reproducibility-focused notebook called [Vizier](https://vizierdb.info/).  It addresses a lot of the issues that drive [hate for Jupyter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9aoi35/i_dont_like_notebooks_joel_grus_jupytercon_2018/) like hidden state (Vizier cells communicate through dataframes that you can view), out-of-order execution (Vizier automatically re-executes dependent cells), and more.

There's also a bunch of neat new features:

1. A Spreadsheet view that allows you to edit data frames directly
2. Support for multiple languages in the same notebook (currently supported: Python, SQL, Scala)
3. Graphical cells to streamline common tasks (e.g., data loading)
4. Edits are automatically added to a version history.

We're still in beta, but would love some feedback! \[[Docs](https://github.com/VizierDB/web-ui/wiki)\]

A bit of my background: I have a pure math PhD from a R1 university, and I've recently decided I'd like to transition into a career in data science/machine learning. I have heard mixed reviews of data science bootcamps, and was wondering if I could get anyones opinion on my situation.

I have taken some graduate courses in ML and understand the theory quite well, and I have a decent programming background (mostly python), with a decent knowledge of algorithms and how to analyze them, but probably need a bit of sharpening/practice to pass any hard interview questions. However, I have not really completed any actual data science projects, so have no portfolio to show to potential employers, and don't have much confidence in actually 'doing' data science. I can explain/prove how certain ML algorithms work, but when given a data set, I barely know where to start. I also feel my interviewing skills need major work.

I am considering enrolling in a data science bootcamp (probably remote, but potentially on-campus) for the following reasons:

1. To get experience doing data science projects. Again, the courses I've taken have focused mainly on theory, and I have not done any projects with data worth showing off. It seems that many of these bootcamps have one or more capstone type projects that would both give me the experience in working with real data as well as help build a portfolio of projects. 
2. Get some extra familiarity with the standard data science tools (pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow etc). I understand how many of the standard algorithms work behind the scenes, but have very little fluency in using these packages so end up having to google something every few minutes (again, mostly since I haven't done many projects myself).
3. To get career mentorship / networking / interview prep. I have been in academia for quite a while now with no relevant work experience, and am not great at playing the 'game' of applying to jobs. It seems that many bootcamps offer a decent amount of career support including resume building, networking, interview questions, mock interviews, etc. I feel this is my weakest area, and that this would potentially be the most valuable thing a bootcamp would offer me. 

Does it sound like I would get anything from doing one of these bootcamps? I was considering either GA/NYCDSA/Springboard. Again, I'm not looking to learn how to program or learn ML theory, but instead get experience on the more practical aspects: getting some of my own 'real' data science projects under my belt and for networking/career guidance.

- emacs with elpy was decent, however plots had to be drawn in a separate window, while I'd like them to be inside an emacs buffer. 

I have been a long time emacs user (although not a sophisticated one) 

I have tried jupyter notebook vi keybindings and ein for emacs but I am not very interested in notebooks.

Opportunity 2: ""Data Scientist"" title in new industry that I find interesting and rewarding. Would be joining 2 person existing data science team that is much more mature than in Opportunity 1.

Departments in organization have power users/data analysts - data scientists help them with Qlik and make datamarts for other reporting needs.

So, since then, I have been taking online courses from UCSD, Coursera, and Udemy on data science, statistics, Python/Advanced Python, ML, Deep Learning, etc.. I have worked on a few ML projects at work, as well as on the side with Kaggle that I can put on my resume (but I didn't get close to the top percentage on the Kaggle projects).

I am now applying to UW Seattle's Data Science program, but need some advice/recommendations on the application. 

It suggests, a **science or engineering degree** (which I have), **calculus and linear algebra** (which I took when I wanted to switch to engineering), **PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE as courses or professional experience** (I have taken courses on the side and applied that knowledge to projects at work and on the side), and **strong communication skills** (I have communicated my 4+ years of biomedical. research to several, different audiences...despite my broca's aphasia). 

Here's my problem(?!)...my GPA in biomedical sciences undergraduate was awful. You know what that means numerically. I had a few medical issues that resulted in me either missing out on the final 4 weeks and finals one semester, and not being able to fit all my classes' work under my medical issue-schedule. However, these biomedical science classes have nothing to do with data science. The only courses that matter are my Calculus courses, which I enjoyed, but I got a B in Calc II, and C+ in Calc III...I honestly have no clue how I pulled it off with missing an exam in Calc III, but I did. I don't like putting medical issues as an excuse for grades...I should have known better, and at least taking a year off to resolve my med. issue. But, now I have to somehow state this on my application. 

The application lets you summarize how you meet the programming requirements and the mathematics requirements in one of the questions.

The essays are: Why UW MS in **Data Science**, **Data Visualization**, and **Failure.** And separate optional essay. I feel like in the Failure essay, I can write about my past experience, but should also be careful with it. 

Anyway, as you can tell, I need a lot of help. And if you don't think I can apply or shouldn't apply, please let me know.

Thank you!!",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I would like to extract movie titles out of any block of text. I have a few ideas of how I could do this but I would love to get your recommendations.

My main idea was to take note of the words and phrases used around the Movie names and write a regex to extract them.

eg.  ""I really like Home Alone."" or ""Jurassic Park is awesome!"".

The regex would look for the following patterns ""really like [a-zA-Z\ \d]"" and ""[a-zA-Z\ \d] is awesome"". I could also look for capitalized words but this is less accurate.

For real-life projects, I think a lot of models require to be trained incrementally. That leaded me to some questions: 

1. Am I wrong if I say that batch gradient descent algorithms does not support incremental learning, but, as long as we can use stochastic gradient descent, it should be fine? 
2. I know that Scikit learn provides some incremental learning models. [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computing.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computing.html) .

The motivation stems from the fact that open source data science ecosystems can benefit more from cross-fertilization of ideas / best practices and easy interoperability of all three systems, as each one brings rather unique features to the table. 

* The [overview page](https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Overview_of_the_Julia-Python-R_Universe) (this is a standalone entry in a public mediawiki that otherwise supports open source risk management)
* The data are structured in subdomain specific tables (statistics, econometrics, etc. etc.) with links to packages or documentation
* Each table incoporates (as its last row) relevant R [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). The idea is to have also a similar structure for Python, aka Python Task Views. Effectively Python Task Views would be a collarative repo + linked github Pages that offers a more structured alternative to existing awesome lists.

I can come up with some pretty long nested formulas, and have had very very basic experience working with macros, mostly recording or copying and pasting them websites and making minor tweaks.

1- predict the future numbers for the regressor(s) - eg. ""Weather"" using a model  --- this would be my future values to include later on in the ARIMA mdoel. 

2- When creating the ARIMA model for for my original time series add the exogenous variable as the second feature while matching the same timeline for example: timeseries one = Sales and time series 2 (exogenous == Weather), (making sure that this matches the time frame eg. January 2010 to December 2010 for both Sales and Weather. 

3- When making forecasting using the ARIMA model I add the ""predicted"" values for ""Weather"" that I had already forecasted in step ""1"", and add that as the second regressor while matching the n\_periods I want to predict for ""Sales"".

https://i.redd.it/1xtb75ls35t31.jpg

Machine Learning Engineer at Curai, Sophia Sanchez applies her knowledge and skills to scale the world's best healthcare to everyone using AI. While Machine Learning models should learn from their history, data collection and labeling is often the rate-limiting step of AI research. Curai's AI tools are deployed in a real-world healthcare setting, giving the team an opportunity to learn from their usage. In her talk at Scale By the Bay this November, Sophia will focus on how to build a semi-automated data feedback loop for ML model retraining, highlighting the specific use case at Curai. 

In advance of her talk, Sophia shared her thoughts on her current work at Curai, why she considers Machine Learning in healthcare to be another tool in the doctor's toolbox rather than a threat to doctor-patient human interaction, and why building a ML data feedback loop is one of the most exciting areas of ML engineering. 

### How did you get interested in Machine Learning and what was the turning point when you decided to join Curai?

I'm a machine learning engineer at [Curai](https://www.curai.com/) where our mission is to scale the world's best healthcare to everyone using AI. I first became interested in Machine Learning after studying computational neuroscience, and have since completed my master's in computer science, with a focus on medical applications of AI. After graduating, I worked as a backend software engineer for a number of years before returning to my roots at the intersection of healthcare and tech. I decided to join Curai because I wanted to make a lasting, positive impact and work on the technical challenges associated with using AI models in a real-world patient setting.

### What's your current role and what exciting things are you working on at the moment? 

I focus on AI techniques and associated infrastructure to automate information gathering. One example of this is a tool to ask patients questions about their medical concerns and, ultimately, to help diagnose. I also integrate these models and systems into production, whether they are used by doctors and patients. It's very exciting to see real medical professionals use this technology and to build tools to help scale the doctor's office. 

As part of my Machine Learning engineering work, I also build data feedback loops that collect model usage data from medical professionals and use that data to retrain or fine tune the next iteration of our models. Data feedback loops are particularly exciting because it means that a model can get better and better over time, learning from its past usage data. 

### What's the biggest challenge that you face in your work and how are you addressing the challenge?

&amp;#x200B;

The number one challenge in building ML-powered medical models is limited access to high quality data, and the ethical implications these limits entail. 

Data scarcity in medicine exists for a number of reasons; hospitals and insurers are disincentivized to share data, heavy regulation around protected health information (PHI) limits access, and information is collected in a decentralized way, meaning that data labeling and quality varies widely between datasets. These regulations are in place for a good reason, namely, to protect patients and prioritize their wellbeing.

Our job is to figure out how to work within these bounds and build high-quality machine learning tools. For example, the engineers and clinical team work together to build data feedback loops, so that we can label and learn from model usage data in production, while keeping privacy and consent a top priority. This means that PHI has been scrubbed from the dataset, that any model used by a doctor and/or patient has passed tests of the highest level of rigor, and that the model can accurately assess its own confidence in a diagnosis (i.e. know that it doesn't know). 

### What's the biggest thing that is misunderstood about ML?

One particularly troubling misconception is that ML will automate away the need for human interaction, bar none. Particularly in medicine, there is a fear of a terminator-style robo-doc that will subsume the traditional doctor-patient interaction. In fact, this couldn't be further from the truth. There are many forms of care that a doctor provides that an AI cannot and should not try to emulate; a doctor's compassion after a difficult diagnosis cannot be replaced by a bot that has ""learned"" compassion, for example.

Instead, I think of ML in healthcare as another tool in the doctor's toolbox; similar to the fMRI or CT scan. In this doctor-in-the-loop model, AI as a whole refers less to artificial intelligence and more to *augmented* intelligence, helping the doctor to provide the highest quality care for his or her patients.

### What are the three trends that will shape the future of ML?

## ML ethics as a top-level requirement

It's no longer enough to have a retrospective think-piece on whether or not a particular ML-based technology is ethical. Especially as ML research advances in fields such as healthcare and self-driving cars, where user safety is paramount, the highest-quality ML work will put ethical considerations as a prerequisite. These considerations include, but are not limited to - where the data come from and potential sources of bias, safety of models, and what it means to leverage ML for ""social good."" For more on this topic, I highly recommend this fantastic [collection of articles](https://medium.com/@eirinimalliaraki/toward-ethical-transparent-and-fair-ai-ml-a-critical-reading-list-d950e70a70ea) on ML and ethics, and this Nature Machine Intelligence [review of AI ethics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2).

## More pressure to explain how a model is making its predictions (model interpretability)

Along with a drive towards proving safety and efficacy of ML models is a trend towards model interpretability. This is motivated by a number of factors, chief among them trust. In the medical realm, if an ML model is asking me personal health questions, I want to understand *why* it chose that question. This mirrors my interactions with my doctor, where I might ask why her follow-up question about traveling to a tropical climate has anything to do with my initial complaint of a fever. Having a better grasp on how a model makes predictions can help us to understand why it succeeds and where it fails.

## Improved Infrastructure and Frameworks for ML Development

As we move towards increased adoption of machine learning in industry, it is important not only to create accurate models, but also to deploy and scale them in a way that provides a quality experience for users and low-friction development for engineers. Building and deploying ML models to production presents its own unique challenges. Collecting, labeling, and versioning datasets, for example, has become increasingly complex with the advent of data-hungry ML models. [Amazon Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and [Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/) are just a few tools that have emerged to help solve this problem.

Second, developers of ML frameworks have made a concerted effort to ease the transition from ML research to serving models in production. Tensorflow has [Tensorflow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving), and Pytorch has been pushing to simplify the workflow to [get models production-ready](https://pytorch.org/blog/model-serving-in-pyorch/). 

Although the discipline of ML engineering is relatively new, style rules and guidelines around ML in production are already forming. Martin Zinkevich's [""Best Practices for ML Engineering""](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/#monitoring) is an excellent read. While we may not yet be at the point of automated model development, improved infrastructure and frameworks for ML development will speed the rate of progress as datasets, architectures, and ML deployment become increasingly complex. 

### What will you talk about at Scale By the Bay and why did you choose to cover this subject? 

[My talk](https://sched.co/RoU9) is on building your own ML data feedback loop. I'll focus on building a semi-automated data feedback loop for ML model retraining, highlighting the specific use case at Curai. I wanted to cover this topic because I think it's one of the most exciting areas of ML engineering. Closing the data loop for model retraining can improve machine learning models over time, which is pretty revolutionary.

### Who should attend your talk and what will they learn?

Learning how to build data feedback loops, where you learn from the data that you're generating from a model in production, is one of the most valuable things you can do to scale your machine learning models. A machine learning model that can learn from its history can become better over time, allowing for rapid iteration and continuous learning.

If you want to know more about scaling machine learning work through automation, building data feedback loops, or how to improve models that are in production, this talk is for you.

### Anything else you'd like to add?

One of the things I love about giving conference talks is the sense of contributing to and being part of our tech community. So come say hi if you want to talk machine learning, are interested in volunteering in tech (shoutout to [Mission Bit](https://www.missionbit.com/)!), or just to chat.

Hi folks,

We are a Data-as-a-Service company (pre beta stage) called politwire.

Daily,  we aggregate hundreds of thousands news articles from all over the  world in near real-time and check if politicians are mentioned there.  Then, if any politician is mentioned at least once in article, we  collect such information as:

* publisher, title, text and summary
* how many times each candidate is mentioned
* tone and polarity of text
* named entities:  

   * persons
   * organizations
   * places
* 20 top keywords
* and some more

We  expect to launch a beta version of an API by the beginning of November;  however, we thought that we might try to launch a weekly newsletter  product. We are willing to provide an access to our database  (PostgreSQL) to people who might want to dig into the data and be able  to report the results as a writer to our newsletter audiance.

We  mostly see data scientists and data journalists students/enthusiasts  who might be interested in it. Even though we cannot pay you for the  moment, we will take care of promotion of our newsletter and augmenting  the number of subscribers. On the other side, you can have a real  experience and, maybe, add few additional lines in CVs, or build a  portfolio.

We will collect the  requests until the end of October. If you would like to participate,  please, DM me and let me know about your background.

Here  is an example from fivethirtyeight that gives you a good idea of what  you could do with pretty basic data (you could do much more with our  data!):

I went to LinkedIn to perform a simple analysis and I noticed that the job market in the DFW area doesn't reflect this same ""demand"". Effectively, there appears to be a greater demand for the keyword ""finance"" at the mid senior to executive level compared to other key words such as business intelligence, statistics, or analytics. I even noticed a similar trend with key phrases such as SQL and Python, but combining the two lead to fewer results. Several potential explanations:

1.) The skill set for analytics is what is in demand, not a full fledged position solely responsible for the carryout of said discipline

2.) Most analytics jobs in demand are entry level and/or haven't matured enough to stratify through the ranks up to the executive team 

3.) LinkedIn isn't the best place to understand labor market demand data, nor are all of the positions posted online

4.) Data analytics are still bifurcated between IT (data engineers, data warehouse developers) and the business (data analysts, FP&amp;A, operations)

5.) The demand for sophisticated statistical knowledge is overplayed or misunderstood in the business world (read I did not say machine learning or data science)

Obviously without a more elegant analysis ironically using statistical inference, this all seems to be causality. 

I'm observing these trends as I work in FP&amp;A and am considering what my future entails. I'm a finance/BI manager and controller all rolled into one, which leaves me with an opportunity to delve deeper into a statistics program or to pursue a traditional business masters degree with a quantitative bend.

Wondering if anyone has any insight or opinions related to the labor market demands and how the business media is pushing the analytics drive? Is it concerning that I can't find ""statistics"" frequently used as a key phrase? Is it alarming that it seems business as usual is still going strong in the DFW market?",22,63,False,self,,,,,

I'm absolutely happy to do it, but I've never done anything like that, and the school isn't really too clear on what needs to be done - the good thing is, they have a budget for training and are open to suggestions, they just don't know where to begin - and neither do I.

So, I'd be interested in possibilities for training in and around London. Travelling is also possible - a colleague just got back from a conference in France.

I am currently running the course of a Master's program in Business Analytics. I'm using the degree route to make the transition into a data analytics position and a DS pos thereafter. I've been following this thread for almost a year now and I've found it to be a great resource for perspective and the nuances of the field.

Anyway, the reason for my post, and I hope that it's okay to post here, is that I've researched the current landscape of online data science and analytics (DSA) skill type platforms... most of the platforms seem to focus on skills at the basic level and may not go deep enough into offering ""real-world"" or dynamic problem sets that require more in-depth problem solving and true-to-form job-like tasks.

I had an interview for a data analyst internship. My background is business, i did well in basic and multivariate statistics. I did study R in university with some basic ML modeling(learned the intuition behind those MLmodels and how to prepare data, basic assumptions, but did not get too deep into linear algebra etc.). I did datacamp SQL and some datacamp for R as an extra to this university course.

I believe I overestimated my skills a little bit and i am worried people would expect too much. I may spend some more time preparing my skills.

Could someone give me some estimation of what should I be capable of doing in a nice structured way topic by topic for both languages ?  I need a guidance on what skills should i prioritize learning taking into consideration their importance in job vs how i perceive my skills.

The internship mainly expects me to analyze data , prepare automized reports, some ad-hoc tasks . How i imagine i will extract data with SQL move it into R and write a script there. They do understand that i come from business background and that i studied SQL manually, i think i talked too much about ML which may indicate some skills that i may not have.

I am using linear regression and there are two assumptions that I have not yet fulfilled:

- Normality. I have tried using log transformations on the revenue variable. This ensures normality but significantly reduced the R-squared value. However I am ignoring this assumption due to the fact that non-normality is not concerning when the number of samples are high. 

- Homoscedasticity. A residual plot indicated the presence of heteroscedasticity (horizontal funnel shaped graph).

Currently, my company uses a REST API Java front-end with PostgreSQL back-end to implement models that my team has constructed. We have a team of IT contractors that do the actual programming work involved with the front and back ends of the API, as our team has little to no experience with standing up a service like this.

However, weve found it incredibly difficult to communicate all of the intricacies of the calculations being expected of the service and have found that with contractors rotating in and out regularly that we constantly have to re-train our contractors on how the service is supposed to work. In addition, without a focused team maintaining the code base, the service is fragile and the code is a bit spaghetti-like. Also weve seen that when teaching new developers the system, that past developers didnt implement them exactly the way we asked, but instead a way that passed our QA tests, so the new contractors get confused when they see an inconsistency.

We have started to feel like it would be better from a quality standpoint for our team to not only handle the data acquisition, model design, modeling, and testing but also the actual build of the API itself. Our team doesnt have a tremendous amount of Java experience, but we learn very quickly and feel that since we have such a close relationship to the model itself, that we could design and build a product that ultimately works better in the long term. However, were worried about the post-production run issues with taking on an entire API service ourselves.

Surely others must feel the same pain when implementing their models. How do others actually deal with model implementation? Do you rely on an IT team to do it or do you stand it up? Do you use something other than Java/PostgreSQL? Any advice with a problem like this?

So I am planning on recording things like how many times did I touch my face today, grams of sugar, stuff like that, and also keeping note of the acne on my face. Eventually I hope to look at the correlation between things like how many times I touched my face vs. how many pimples I got the next day or so.

I've heard about time series before and how they deal with leading indicators; is this the way I should go? Or is there something simpler I can use? For context, I know R very well, and python some.

Im applying to PhD programs this year and am looking for faculty mentors who are experts in data science/machine learning. I did my undergrad in psychology and built up a competitive CV. Aside from that I had a stats minor and took all my electives in computer science and data science. Data science was my plan B because I knew psych PhD programs were insanely competitive, and I recently ended up getting a job offer as a data scientist which would start early to mid next year once I get the security clearance. By that time, I could have already applied, interviewed, and received an offer from clinical PhD programs.

Psychology grad training has always been my plan A, but now that Im leaning toward the data science field, Id only want to stick with psychology if I could heavily incorporate those skills and principles. I see a lot of computationally heavy research being done in experimental and cognitive psych, but its been harder to find clinical psychologists doing that type of research. I know theyre out there, but searching all the faculty throughout all the programs, or all the authors on every relevant publication for a clinical psychologist who is accepting a grad student this year is like finding a needle in a haystack. So, Im posting here to see if anyone has any leads. 

To elaborate on my interests, Im set on clinical because it fits well with my personality and background, plus Id want more skills than just research under my belt after a 5-6 year program. As for research topics, Id rather not limit myself in my initial search because Im actually more concerned about the methods and the use of python/R, machine learning or big data, but eventually Im going to only apply to mentors whose research I find interesting, of course. My programming and stats skills are perhaps the strongest part of my application, and I feel they would be lost on a professor who is still just clicking around in SPSS. Theres nothing wrong with that per se, but I know Id be happiest with a mentor who both values my data science skills and provides many opportunities for me to develop them.

So, if you are faculty and have some projects you think I might be interested in, please reply or pm me. Id love to take a look at your university page or CV.

I'm thinking about pursuing a further carreer in data analysis and/or statistics, preferably in  government/international organisations or an international NGO. Let me shortly introduce myself:

I have a masters degree in fundamental mathematics but when I was writing my thesis I realised that academia is not really my cup of tea and started teaching math in high school. 

While I loved my students teaching was mostly a social and didactic challenge and I realized that I do not really continue to enjoy the routine of preparing lessons and correcting, 'making math enjoyable' and class management.

Because I became very interested in the educational system I started a job in our ministry of Education. Among others, data analysis is a part of my job and the data part of my job is something that I really enjoy and would like to know more about data analysis and/or science. 

While I love the fact that I am learning a lot about  policy and the functioning of governments and will continue doing this job for a couple years I realise that the 'data part' of my job is pretty basic. As I develop my soft skills as communication, project management and collaboration on my current job I would like to develop my hard skills on the side to steer my career in that way in the next step. 

On this moment, I have some basis data skills and a solid mathematical/numerical background. I'm a quick learner and an analytical thinker.  My coding skills and (deeper) statistical knowledge are a little rusty.

I am seriously considering starting a program in 'statistical data analysis' in Ghent (I live in Belgium) and have some questions about what your opinion is  on education and which way is preferable:

1) Do you think that a master's degree in 'statistical data analysis' is worth it? As I'm young, have no kids would be feasible to combine it with my job. But it would require some discipline, time and money wise. The other option is getting some training related to my job and develop my skills through udemy, datacamp etc. What are in your opinion the pros and cons in both situations?

2) How would a formal master degree in data analysis increase my job prospects? Preferably in government, international organizations or NGO's.

3) How did those of you who have an established data career develop your skills and knowledge? Which field do you work in?

Thanks in advance for sharing your insights :)

Regression was chosen due to the easiness of implementation for our use case. The goal of the model is to predict results from existing parametric tests to avoid further testing. The work flow is as follows: the model's coefficients are stored in a version controlled folder and the software in the instrument will pull the coefficients to make the predictions after a certain point in the program flow. The predictions along with other instrumentation parameters is stored in an RDBMS in real time. All the data is batch loaded to an on premise data warehouse compatible with Spark &amp; Python every 12 hours.

A small randomized portion of the incoming material actually goes through the full cycle of testing. The real parametric data from this material is compared to the predictions from the deployed model to make sure the model is generalizing well with new material.

Hello everyone I would like some advice on how to break start a career in the field of Analytics, I would like to know your past experience and how you ended being a Data Analyst/Scientist if you are one, or if any one is in a similar position as mine I would like them to share as well so I can get a sense of what to expect so I can temper my expectations. A bit of background on me, some information is relevant while some is not but I am a Senior majoring in Data Analytics in South Florida, I have an AA in Civil Engineering as well as a College Credit Certificate in Business Intelligence and I'm expecting to graduate in the upcoming spring with a B.S in Data Analytics. Hooray! But I'm having trouble starting my career in Analytics, the D.A (Data Analytics) program I'm currently in is pretty awesome to say the least, the program allows us hands on experience with various software to solve business problems or projects. The C.C.C (College Credit Certificate) also allowed us on hands experience but the B.S D.A program is way more in depth, we've also covered statistics in depth mainly regression but very useful for machine learning. During the program I've worked with different software and programming languages such as Python and PowerBI and towards the ends of post I will list the programs and skills I've worked with. Not only have I worked with these programs in school but on my own time I've put in countless hours to hone my skills with these programs and create my own projects, especially with python and machine learning because I would more so like to be a Data Scientist. The problem is that now I'm going to graduate soon and would hope to have a D.A or D.S job in the near future before I graduate, but I fear my lack of ""real world experience"" is hindering me from getting one of these jobs. Granted I should've looked for a entry level D.A job after completing the C.C.C which would of helped me gained experience, but this sadly isn't the case. I have completed a Civil Engineering Internship in high school which the work done relates more so to an Data Analyst and I have letter of recommendation from the Internship to help strengthen my profile a bit, but as for work experience that's all I can really put that relates to the jobs I've applied for, I've basically worked retail all the way up to this current point and I'm ready to leave. I've added school projects that I had to present and that I'm pretty proud of to my work experience but this may not be enough. Over bout a two months ago I applied to a lot of jobs, ones where I would say I over qualified and ones where I greatly under qualified and I've been contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn which is pretty good but to no avail of a job, heck I've even reached out to recruiters and Analyst on LinkedIn just recently to see if I will have any success. I've had about 4 phone interviews and two turned into onsite interviews and another phone interview upcoming. I'm still waiting on a response from the first onsite which is from a popular hospital, the interview went pretty well in my opinion but they're only concerns is that I've never used tableau but I assured them I can learn tableau pretty quickly because of my experience with PowerBI and the other concern is how will I balance work and school. This job seems pretty simple, I would be creating dashboards and I believe that's about it, personally I would like to do more, but one step at a time right? (I interviewed with the B.I team and the interview was more so a conservation which was pretty enjoyable). While the other on site interview didn't go so well, it was one of those jobs where you need like 5 years of experience which I clearly didn't have to them which is justifiable, but the next one upcoming is more like an Data Reporting Analyst job just like the first on site interview I did. My concern with the jobs is that the skills I've used in school and on my own time will start to fade because the company doesn't utilize the tools as well as I don't want to be underpaid with all the skills I've acquired and how I've put them to use, especially living in South Florida where things can get expensive. Basically I would like a Data Analyst/Scientist role where it is not just creating dashboards but analyzing problems and solving them, but I am still grateful for the interviews I've done. To summarize I lack ""real world experience"" and feel like it would hinder my job opportunities in jobs I feel that I can do. I would like advice from anyone on what should I expect. I will leave the programs I've used and a couple of questions for anyone to answer based on my skills or even their skills.

Programs/Languages I've Used and Confidence:

1. SQL/MSSQL (Confident)
2. Excel (Very Confident)
3. Microsoft Reporting Services such as SSRS,SSAS,SSIS (Moderate) 
4. PowerBI (Very Confident)
5. Python (Max Confident) A lot of my own time is spent with python working with M.L algorithms mainly different types of regressions, and we are going to learn about different algorithms like classification very soon. I have a great understanding of Gradient Descent and can explain the results of my project pretty well. This is something I am very passionate about. 
6. Statistics (Very Confident) Thought I threw this in there although it's not a Program/Language I believe I have a good grasps on statistics and can be useful for any job.
7. DAX (Low Confident) Used in Excel, Reporting Services, and PowerBI but not extensively, although I still know how to write simple code with it.

Questions.

1. What should I expect in my position or anything general?
2. What is the best path? Entry Level and work my way up, keep applying to Data Scientist jobs, or even the path you took? (There aren't really a lot of Junior Data Scientist jobs down here)
3. What salary range should I target?
4. Do you think work experience is key factor or is it bluff? 
5. Your experience?
6. General Advice?
7. How did you break start into this field in Analytics?

I am working on a risk prediction model to understand an individual's risk of developing a disease. I have labelled outcomes as 0 (healthy controls), and 1 (diseased individuals). I have fit a logistic regression model with my risk factors as predictors, then used it to predict the outcome in my test set. 

I have not forced my algorithm to classify these individuals with or without disease (assigning 0 or 1), as I am just trying to differentiate between the two groups. From a medical perspective, it makes sense that there are individuals with elevated risk who will not develop disease, whereas there are individuals without elevated risk that will develop the disease. 

When plotting my predicted values between the two groups, I am able to see quite clear distinction between the two groups. When plotting AUROC, I am getting a high value, near 0.85. I am having trouble understanding the AUROC in this context though, because I have not forced the algorithm to classify individuals with/without the disease. I understand that my model is still able to differentiate between the two groups, but I then do not understand exactly what the AUROC is telling me without the actual true/false positive and true/false negative values. Can anyone help clarify this?

I dont think I understand the role of the activation function and what it does.  Everything I read, it explains it as applying non-linearity to it, but I still dont know what that means.  To me,  it just transforms it to a new number, possibly [-1,1], which goes through another set of linear combination and then applied another function. Can someone explain this to me? I dont know if there is a simpler way to explain this...but what is it doing that can help you get closer to the output?

Another question I have,  whatis the benefit of adding additional hidden layers or nodes in the hidden layers.  How does that potentially help with the prediction?  Like,  what is the benefit of having multiple layers(and as a result multiple activation function)? If you have a a single layer, wont the backprop eventually still get to the same result as multiple layers(but maybe require more iterations?)?

I answer this here  [https://medium.com/@fkhurshed/https-medium-com-fkhurshed-ds-build-a-portfolio-they-say-1d015fbb3f89](https://medium.com/@fkhurshed/https-medium-com-fkhurshed-ds-build-a-portfolio-they-say-1d015fbb3f89) 

And it's below as well. Comments appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

If youre in data science or tech, youll often hear a recommendation that you should have a portfolio. Theyre rightbecause showing what you can do is always more impressive than telling someone what you can do. A picture paints a thousand words, as they say.

But what should you include in your portfolio?

In general, I recommend at least having three things:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Full analysis
3. Data visualization

# Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is a key component in data analysis and youll often need to rely on data to tell you the history. Learning how to do a good EDA is key, plus its a good habit to get into. And the processes, functions and programs you build will be useful in future analyses.

**What should you do for EDA?**

First pick a data set youre not familiar with, and preferably not something extremely overused in data science examples. This means no iris, mtcars or titanic data sets. Go to your local government portal and find an open data set of interest. Explore Kaggle Datasets, UN Data, data.gov or various other sources. Pick something that interests you so that you can have some interest in the data. Natural curiosity about what the data is telling helps to drive the analysis and if youre not somewhat interested it can be hard to determine what direction to go.

# Full analysis

One full analysis is also a really good idea. Pick a problem, something that interests you and is within your skill levels. It should preferably be something a large portion of the population can relate to. Sports, movies, books, housing, safety, anything related to the local news are good focuses. You probably want to stay away from politics because you have no idea which side an interviewer may be on and you may not want to provide a reason for bias or discrimination. Or maybe you do want to work with someone with values that align, but make that decision explicitly.

If youre aiming to work in a specific industry it can be useful to align your project with the industry. So, if youre trying to get into the health care field do some analysis on medicare data.

The full analysis should include a description of the problem statement, data cleaning steps, the results and implications. Youll likely want to show the details of your work here including the data cleaning, aggregation and especially the assumptions that youve made.

This allows you to demonstrate your full process and problem solving skills to others.

Some sample ideas for projects include:

* What are the optimal times of day for a taxi driver to be operating?
* Where in the city are there houses that are undervalued? Can you predict a house value based on a set of characteristics?
* Can you determine which factors affect the probability of having a heart attack?

# Data Visualization

Every single job will have a requirement to communicate information clearly. Every single job. Graphs and interactive visualizations help communicate your final results or allow users to find their own answers. You should have some basic familiarity with a visualization tool, whether thats Excel, SAS, Tableau, PowerBI or JasperSoft. The visualization does not need to be interactive, but it should clearly tell a story or results of an analysis. Make sure to take some time to design it well, considering the appropriate usage of colours, whitespace, and graphic types. And yes, pie charts can get you in trouble here.

# Bonus: Re-mix of someone elses code

One additional project that you can include in your portfolio is taking someone elses project (with their permission, of course) and extending it. This does not mean pointing out the flaws but it can mean showing an alternative approach or taking an analysis and moving it up a level or changing a portion of the analysis by using a different methodology for comparison/contrast. This shows that you can take someone elses work, including the code and work with it. This is essential in jobs where youll be working in a team and with other peoples code on a regular basis.

I also saw a post today on someone from the fashion industry wanting to break into the field. If you're one of those people, you probably already heard a lot about how data science is not as glamorous as 'tech enthusiasts' make it seem. I'm also here to tell you that it is highly unlikely that you would be able to get your resume seen. I'm just being honest here by bringing in the perspective of someone in the field. Just doing coursera courses or bootcamps might give you a good enough experience, but a few hiring managers may not even look at your resume. 

I joined a company few months ago as a data scientist. I also have friends from school who now work at FAMANG companies and are also heavily involved in the hiring process. What I'm about to say is the general consensus between us when we are looking at resumes. Note, it IS anecdotal. This is just based on my, some of my colleagues, and my friends (and their colleagues') experiences. There are THOUSANDS of applicants per job listing. Our first step is to filter them out based on their education and this is how we do it:

1. First I'd look at all the PhD students in a related field (CS, Math, Stat etc). 
2. MS students in a related field (CS, Math, Stat, etc)
3. PhD in the domain area depending on the company (eg: Biostat for a healthcare company). 
4. MS in domain area. 
5. Undergrad students a related field (CS, Math, Stat, etc). 
6. PhD students from a completely different field (like psychology). 
7. Masters students from a completely different field.
8. Bachelors students from a completely different field.
9.  FINALLY bootcamps (but we never get through that). 

Most of the times we have more than enough PhD students in a related field that we don't even need to go through the rest of the filtering process. 

I respect everyone wanting to transition into the field. It is such a rewarding field to be in (at least for me). However, you also have a lot of people who just can't handle the job expectations. The data is messy, not like what you'd see in Kaggle. We don't just throw deep learning at every problem we see. There is a lot of data analysis. A LOT more than you think. You also have a lot of stakeholders who want to know exactly when your model would work/fail. You'd also be expected to implement technologies in existing papers but would be encouraged to come up with your own unique solutions sometimes. Hiring Managers know this. Not saying that everyone out of a bootcamp won't be able to handle these responsibilities. However, statistically speaking, the filtering process I listed above is generally the safer bet in knowing whether a candidate would be competent. So if you're in a profession like plumbing and wanting to transition into the field by learning a bunch of coursera courses, just be cautious. Your resume will not be given a second glance unless you do some projects (not course projects with clean data) that really stand out.",28,9,False,self,,,,,

I am an undergraduate in a data science (mathematics-based) program. I have heard the advice that it is good to be experienced in as many aspects of data science as you can (ie, statistics, machine learning, visualization, communication...) , but that it is also helpful to have an area that you focus on slightly more. I have always been fascinated by time series, and I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions (from industry) of sub-areas that are in demand. I would love to know my options in regards to choosing my electives, because I would like to give myself a slight edge, if possible.

Bonus question: If time series is a good ""specialization,"" what math classes would be relevant? Fourier, PDEs? 

I really appreciate the advice!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I am trying to analyze AB test results for user engagement (total time spent on site) for control and treatment samples. The sample distributions are heavily right skewed as you would expect- most people spend a few minutes on the site while some heavy users spend longer.  The treatment size is 10% of the population with total sample size \~ 50000..

I am thinking i need a 2-sample t-test (unpaired) since different users are assigned into control and treatment.

The first task is to identify the metric- total time per user aggregated over days OR total time per day aggregated over users.... Do you guys have any tips on how to choose this? Also, am i right in thinking I need to sample \~10% of the both variations so my samples are of equal size? 

Importantly,  my plots don't seem to be satisfying the assumptions for a t-test, i.e. normal distribution and equal variance ...

I've been given the opportunity to take a look at text analytics to support an operational risk (OR) function.  The scenario is that the business creates a large amount of transactional data in the form of notes / strings in an SQL database.  While there are some supplementary segmentation variables (Time, business area, customer partition), the notes are what we primarily have to work with.

The ask is to provide OR with a tool to target transactions which are deemed risky for a wide range of reasons: not following business guidelines; not adhering to regulatory compliance; fraud; discriminatory behavior; etc.

I currently have at my disposal open source coding (R, Python), data extraction tools (WinSQL, Teradata), and business intelligence tools (Tableau, Cognos, etc.). 

I have two planned approaches that I'd love feedback on. 

The first is to work with OR to identify key scenarios, and the words that might be associated with those scenarios.  That word bank would then be used to flag transactions.  The more key words, the higher the 'probability' assigned to the transaction as something to review.  A word like ""Accident"" on its own would not flag the transaction, but combining ""Accident"" with ""Approve"" would be. 

This approach seems more clumsy, and would still require some review by OR to sort through the different buckets of scenarios I've created.

The second is to create a supervised learning scenario.  I would take the OR word bank, and using that, would explicitly tell a ML algorithm that these transactions were of interest, and everything else wasn't.

This approach is a little outside my comfort zone considering I haven't done a lot of supervised learning. 

Any thoughts on ML packages, best practices, creating a word bank, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  Enjoy your week!",1,1,False,self,,,,,

They have a dataset with questions from clients and the job is to build a classifier and ultimately return insights where they can see the different categories/tags of questions.

I would be on my own for this, as it is sort of a freelance, project-based assignment.

The reasons why I want to do this are:- it seems like an interesting, rewarding project
-name of the company is a great reference
-great working conditions and salary

Now my question is, I am in over my head? Or should I take the challenge and study on the go? I do have about 2 months left to study and practice similar cases (aside from my fulltime job).
I also kind of feel like a douchebag to legit NLP experts, who would do a way better job at this than I would, but dont have the opportunity

Im 22 years old, im just finishing up my finance undergrad, while I am also working as an M&amp;A intern at a boutique investment bank. I live in europe (hungary more specifically), so as university is free, Im looking to further myself by doing a masters degree. The problem is that I am really undecided if the next step should be towards data science or finance, since Im interested in both of them.



#Goals/interests

If I had to order my end goals in a list (so if 1. doesnt work out, then 2... etc), it would be the following:



1. Co-launch a startup



2. Work in private equity or at an investment fund



3. Freelancer data scientist



4. Stay in M&amp;A



So pretty much all over the place.


Keeping my ordered list of goals in mind im wondering what you guys think the best decision would be if you were in my place.


#Pros/Cons

So far, as I see it the pros and cons of each program is the following:



Finance:



-Pros:


- Probably better networking opportunity

- I could dip my toes into data science aswell, as there is one course offered there that focuses on this area

- Specializing in one area (finance) might be a better decision than generalizing (finance+data science).




-Cons:


- I have already studied finance at my undergrad, so I dont know how much extra knowledge the program could offer me


- A data science background is more useful at an early stage startup



Data science:



Pros:

- Easier to find a team or ideate about a solution to base a startup upon

- A Data science masters and a finance bsc could possibly be a good combination 



Cons:

- I plan on attending a 2 year long masters program (At HEC). Seeing that most data scientists have a Phd, I feel like the knowledge I would gain there would be very basic, not to mention that I have read countless articles that say online resources are even better for learning data science than a masters degree.


- Networking options would probably not be as good as they are at a good finance masters program

Just wanted to share three quick pointers I think might be valuable as someone who got an entry level analyst role on a data science team at a start-up and is now hiring for one:

1) *Data cleaning, data cleaning, data cleaning*: These are the golden words on the resume. Most companies today are trying to apply ML to really complicated real-world problems, which means messy data. If you talk about experience where you have cleaned messy real-world data in detail, that will put you ahead of other candidates.

2) *Generic Projects*: We all know them: housing price regression, MNIST, the flower one, Twitter sentiment analyses, MovieLens recommendation system, etc. Having done this aren't *bad* necessarily, but to someone with who has been around the block of online machine learning courses, these aren't all that impressive. Filling out your resume with original, even if they are relatively simple, projects and models that incorporate data cleaning is much more attention-grabbing.

3) *Why??*: I don't really mind people who message me on LinkedIn, deduce my work email or go to the effort of writing cover letters but you aren't really doing much for yourself if all you are saying is ""Hey I saw the job, I think I am qualified, can I have the job?"". That is what everyone who is applying is saying, you're just being more annoying about it. If you look into our company, even just regurgitate our mission statement in your cover letter, it at least shows you aren't just spraying and praying. I would be more likely to consider someone less qualified who communicated why they want the job.

And I don't think this would belong in the transitioning megathread, because I have already been in the field .I've also kept some details vague on purpose,but I do live in the US.

So my undergrad covered the CS theoretical fundamentals and I took linear algebra courses and ML courses as electives

After that I took some part time grad school and did some startup work in image processing and ML; this didn't consist of much backend engineering, but mainly testing out/implementing/creating image processing and ML algorithms; I did this for about a year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 got plenty of recruiters pinging me on linkedin, but the problems I found was that I'm not some expert on

these ""leetcode"" problems and system design problems. Also I have a lack of backend knowledge;this would be especially important for the jobs I was interviewing for; even if I make it past the interview,  I know I would be fumbling in the beginning and I doubt a company who would hire me for an advanced role would hold my hands while I'm figuring this out.

&amp;#x200B;

 I stopped  working for them particular reason, and I did get a software engineering role at one of these Indian IT consulting firms, where they send you around to other companies for whatever software role they need. 

Seems like these IT companies have a bad reputation for being easy to get into and being ""body shops"",though the companies they send you to are often major companies.

I needed the income, so I took the role, and so far I have been put on some backend web dev project role where I'm working with cloud services/deployment, REST API stuff, HTTP,etc. I'm thinking this stuff is some of the stuff I need to be a successful ML engineer, so I'm temporarily satisfied trying to pick these skills up before I switch back to an ML role.

And  of course some self study on leetcode and other backend things such as distributed systems/database related topics/systems design are on my to do list too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here are my questions.

Does this temporary break from an ML role look strange? I won't forget the basics of ML anytime soon, I already have a decent base in ML theory,but I am worried about the optics of it. And there's the fact that its some consulting body shop that might be negative mark on my profile/resume. 

I'm also worried about linkedin;its was my source of steady interviews for ML roles. Like would recruiters stop pinging me once they see my current role is no longer ML based?Also should I remove any mention of ML from my headline, or keep it there since its within my skillset? Right now my headline was Machine Learning Engineer @previouscompany; I haven't updated it in a while because I haven't been job searching.Would it be weird for it to just say ""Machine Learning Engineer""?

Should i take a class or write a paper? Should I do a side project or focus more on my work projects?

This is my personal ranking - it's not universal by any means - but it should give you a decent idea of what matters most in the eyes of hiring managers in industry (academia and pure research is a different beast).

There are two rankings - a primary ranking based on the results of the work, and a secondary ranking based on the source of the work.

**Primary ranking based on output:**

1. Generated profit/revenue or reduced cost.
2. Led to an organizational change (process, decision making, policy, etc.) without a provable impact.
3. Created a product (website, app, etc.) that can be accessed by a hiring manager.

*Logic behind the primary rankings rankings:*

Generating actual value - profit, revenue, etc. - is very difficult to do regardless of where you want to do it. Whether it's monetizing your own app, or convincing a company that you interned with to purchase differently, etc., it's *very* difficult to get to that stage. And that is because not only do you need a good idea, a good problem, and a good solution, but you also need to work through all the other external forces out there to make value happen. That means you need to influence decision makers, customers, colleagues, leaders, etc. so that what you thought of actually materializes real value.

Short of that, you have work that led to change, but where that change isn't easy to tie to real $ value. This happens often - you build a model that makes it easier for people to do a task. So that saves them time - but does that actually increase their productivity? Well, it depends on what they do with their free time. Maybe they now spend their free time dicking around on reddit. Who knows. However, this is the type of experience that show you can go through all of the stages of getting something to actually get deployed - which is, in a lot of cases, the hardest part of the data science process.

Lastly, you have experience that created a publicly available product. It's unclear whether this product will generate value or not, but at least a tangible product allows others to easily evaluate the quality of your work. It is fundamentally different than just talking about what you did - you can actually *show* others what you did.

Anything below that is going to be looked at as low value experience. That is, if you worked on something that didn't generate value, no one uses, and no one can actually see, it might as well have never happened. *We all have projects of this type -* so it's nothing to be embarrassed about, but you want to make sure that you lead the conversation with the projects which are higher quality experience based on output.

This is also why most hiring managers tend to disregard personal projects - because very few of them actually provide value. And if they don't provide value to someone, they are very difficult to actually evaluate. 

**Secondary ranking based on type of experience:**

1. Work project
2. Research project
3. Capstone project 
4. Personal project 
5. Classroom project

*Logic behind the secondary rankings:*

To me, there are a couple of things that I feel a data scientist needs to be able to do in order to be successful:

1. Work with other people - including some who will be unnecessarily difficult to deal with
2. Get answers to problems even when the answers are ugly
3. Know how to change the answer without changing the question - i.e., learning how to change their approach without abandoning the original intent/problem statement.

Work experience is generally the only type of experience that covers all three. You can't escape organizational red tape, you *have* to get an answer to problems, and you can't just switch the problem statement at your convenience so that you can get a nice answer. Other, higher-up people in the organization can influence how fixed problem statements are, but you cannot unilaterally go change the rules to make your answer pretty.

Research has two gaps: sometimes you can get away with doing research on your own and avoid others, and you often get to choose and frame your research work to be something you can actually solve. Really good research experience (which would be on par with work experience) would be projects where you *have* to work with other people (especially cross-departmental work), and projects where the research statement isn't flexible, e.g., when a funding agency asked for a specific solution and you can't bend that to suit your needs.

Capstone projects can have gaps across the board. A lot of times you work on them alone, you get to decide what you want to do and bend the definition as you see fit to get a cool capstone project out of it, and to get nice, elegant solutions out of it. There are too many moving pieces to ever get caught in a situation where the project you're working on will just require you to power through some really painful, soul crushing stuff.

Personal projects share all of those issues, but to a greater degree. The worst part is that they are 100% optional - you don't even need to do this work, so it's very likely that you will self select only into projects that you know you can solve. I would say there are absolutely good personal projects - but those will be the ones that include ugly, gross steps that no one would normally want to do. Like scraping and cleaning gross data. Or doing a bunch of non-sophisticated data manipulation to cover big gaps in data. 

Classroom projects are the worst because they are like personal projects only that on top of that you get expert opinion for a professor to steer you away from infeasible projects. So again, you will self select into projects that can be solved, and you can likely fudge them as needed to make sure they are solvable.",4,18,False,self,,,,,

Does anyone have any advice on how that should be done? As an example, I typically find myself in the same data wrangling scenario, and despite knowing how to solve the problem with various pandas commands, I'm never sure if the script is laid out in the most readable way.

Let's say you have a long script that has one goal: take multiple tables of data from somewhere clean them, then combine all the data into some output table of interest. Along the way, you  do various operations (merge, drop, rename, map, filter, aggregate, whatever) and you end up with a final csv table.

Common ""programming tips"" tell you to make everything modular (""functions should only do *one* thing"", ""functions should be small"", etc.). The problem is, I'm not convinced that data science lends itself to this practice as well as a large codebase for software development. When getting data from point A (raw) to point B (tidy), depending on the complexity of the operations along the way, I will often come back to the script to find where I've accidentally duplicated something during a merge, or dropped something I wanted to keep, or omitted some important data. It seems that in cases like this, I want to see everything in a line, i.e.
- Merge table 1 and 2 on this column
- Groupby these columns and keep only columns X and Y.
- Use function f on columns X and Y to get column Z.
- Merge table 3 into this table
- etc.

When everything is modularized, it feels like you have to go hunting in a list of tiny functions all defined somewhere below your `main()` to see what all happened along the way. 

The point of all this is, are there some standard practices out there that are *not* for ""programming in python"", but rather for ""wrangling data in python using pretty much only pandas and that's it"" because usually, all I see out there is yet another person telling me the function signature for `DataFrame.groupby` or some such thing we have all read more than we need by this point. On the other hand, if you look at the high-level code organization, you'll get into repo folder structure, with `setup`, `requirements`, `tests` and the like, which is a bit far on the other side of the spectrum (not to say it isn't important, too). But where are the examples of the best way to script wrangling of raw tables A, B, and C into tidy table D, and the way to structure your script to do that? I'm looking for some advice from someone who isn't teaching about ""why pandas is useful"" nor ""how to to keep your software project team organized while developing your 5 million-line code base""

The obvious way to rank skaters is to take their average score of the season and rank them from highest to lowest. However, one potential problem with this approach is that the scores are averaged over different events, and no two events are the same (think different judges, ice conditions, or event altitudes). Therefore, I came up with different ranking models that can somehow tease out the skater effect (how good a skater intrinsically) from the event effect (how does an event affect the score of a skater). The models themselves are essentially just simple linear models, but I'd never thought about using linear regression this way. 
I've also documented how my models perform over the baseline model, which is the average season score model mentioned above.

So some background,  I recently graduated with a bachelors in math/cs with emphasis in machine learning and data science. After graduation, I got my first ""real"" job working as an analyst in the business intelligence/data analytics department of a ""well-known"" company in it's industry.

The thing is, the data analytics department is still pretty ""new"" as data analytics wasn't a big focus for this company before, and now it is currently building up its tech stack. Right now, I am the most ""technically"" proficient person in the department (i.e. I know how to write code, and do data sciencey things). My colleagues are more proficient with excel, and know how to do SQL queries.

Right now, I do the software engineering work in my department, as well as build data pipelines, develop data pull automations, maintain some of our databases, and built some small machine learning models.

I am able to complete all the work that I do at this company, but I feel I am ""learning as I go"". How can I learn to develop production level work and best practices if I the resources aren't there at work (besides researching online and trial and error)?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

So, I currently work in business intelligence with a team of about 15 people and we support many departments in the company. About 8 or 9 months ago, the word came down from the top that DATA SCIENCE was going to be the hip new thing that everyone in BI was going to learn and master to help push the business forward. The idea was to create bootcamps led by senior data scientists to help develop new data scientists. Our leaders have been pushing managers to encourage us to go into these programs, but i've been pushing back big time saying a bootcamp is not going to work because it takes years to master these skills needed to be a good data scientist. I did have a chance to speak with the project manager and a couple leads in the program and I asked how important math was in this program and the response I got was you just need to know Stats 101 and you should be fine. I had asked about linear algebra and I got kind of a little bit of silence on the phone and someone said you don't need to know math at that level. Is it normal for companies to underestimate how much work is actually required to do data science? I mean, the math alone is some serious stuff. From what I could gather, a lot of the program is geared towards learning to write the code in python using existing models, tuning those models, but not really getting deep enough to understand all the math going on in the background.

I just recently graduated this May, and am working as software engineer at a tech company, with some internships under my belt as well. A big reason for my low gpa was that I spent a lot of time working on my own startups in college and didnt really care about my grades because I didnt think I would ever go to grad school and the jobs I was interested in at the time (software engineering) didnt care about gpa much as long as it was over 3.0.

For management consulting it seems like the subject matter of your degree doesnt matter too much as long as its analytical, so I thought I would choose something Im actually interested in and if business doesnt work out, Ill still be in the running for Software and data science jobs.

I am quite curious as to whether or not courses in advanced probability theory may be of help in working as a data science (or even simply in graduate level statistics/data science courses)?

As an undergraduate, I did a degree in Maths focussing on applied maths and statistics, in which I did classes such as Intro Probability, Intro Stats, Measure theoretic probability, stochastic processes, linear and generalised linear models, bayesian stats, diff equations and complex analysis. I also took a couple of comp sci courses such as Algorithm design and Object Oriented programming. 

Id have to say my favourite classes in my degree were those in probability. I found the stats to be too heavy on the theory that it was actually hard to learn practical implementation. But now I am considering either doing a masters degree in maths (focussing on the same areas as my undergraduate, namely probability and statistics) and masters degree in data science.

For reference, the data science program has a lot of the masters of maths statistics subjects as core, the maths is really emphasised in the course. 

The main reason I dont want to do the maths degree is because the statistics I do will likely be overly theoretical and not too practical. Also, Ill have to take compulsory pure/applied math courses alongside it which probably wont be of benefit.

The main reason I dont want to do the data science program is because it will be lacking in the probability theory which, I feel, is foundational to statistics. 

So simply put, are graduate courses in measure theoretic probability, random processes (which includes martingales, point processes and general CTMCs), stochastic calculus and others in any way useful for a practicing data scientist? This will likely be the deciding factor in my choice, and I havent seen too many data science programs with subjects like these.

Any response would be greatly appreciated.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

As the title says, I am looking for both success stories and disappointing failures of applications of **modern** unsupervised document embedding techniques on actual problems (as opposed to academic benchmarks, toy datasets, academic evaluation tasks, etc.). The main focus is naturally on industry uses for business/product problems, but I would also love to hear about cases from government bodies, non-profits, use in research (with empirical measurement and where document embedding is one of the tools, not the subject of research) and any other ""real life"" use. I would love to hear about your experience, but connecting me to people you know or even hinting me towards companies or projects you know used these techniques (or tried to) would also be of tremendous help.

What's in it for you? Well, I'm preparing a talk for [the data science track of the CodeteCON #KRK5 conference](https://codetecon.pl/en/#program) based on my [literature review-y blog post on document embedding techniques](https://towardsdatascience.com/document-embedding-techniques-fed3e7a6a25d), and while I feel I have a pretty good overview of the academic papers, benchmarks and SOTA status up until the most recent stuff to come out in the field at this point in time, I can't say the same for uses in the industry; I have a partial view from my experience in one ongoing project to actually use this, and experience shared by some of my data scientist friends (all in Israel, naturally) - most of it, so far, by the way, is that averaging (good) word embeddings is a very tough ""baseline"" to beat.

This is why I thought reaching out to get a better sense of things in the industry world-wide, and enriching my talk with the status of actual successes and industry applications will give people attending my talk more value, and will serve my attempt to make my talk a status report on the topic.

And (coming back to WIIFM) naturally (I think), I intend to share any (share-able) knowledge I accumulate not only in my talk, but also by adding a section dedicated to it to [the aforementioned blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/document-embedding-techniques-fed3e7a6a25d), and maybe even by writing an extended post around it (if enough interesting trends and issues come up). So, hopefully, if you are (like me) interested in this, we might also end up getting, together, a nice overview of where the industry stands at the moment.

What **modern** techniques (so no variants of bag-of-words or topic modeling techniques) am I talking about? These are the ones that I know of (I'd love to hear about others!):

* n-gram embeddings
* Averaging word embeddings (including all variants, e.g. SIF)
* Sent2Vec
* Paragraph vectors (doc2vec)
* Doc2VecC
* Skip-thought vectors
* FastSent
* Quick-thought vectors
* Word Movers Embedding (WME)
* Sentence-BERT (SBERT)
* GPT/GPT2 (can also be supervised)
* Universal Sentence Encoder (can also be supervised)
* GenSen (can also be supervised)

I am the only data scientist in my company, and although I have a PhD specifically in applying data science in my domain area, I have only been at this company for 3 years.  I have a colleague who has been caught up in the AI/ML craze who is a hobbyist programmer. He received permission and has been working this year on interfacing with a certain database and creating a user interface for a ML process optimization tool. I was supposed to help with the ML part by helping guide him in how to curate and clean data, generate a model, and implement that model in a sustainable fashion.

Instead, he has created his own version, a Frankenstein-ish ensemble of models that is completely uninterpretable.

I am currently a Math PhD about to defend in January. I work in a field in functional analysis that uses a lot of measure theory (but no stats).

I have been considering transitioning careers since I don't enjoy my research area anymore. I have enjoyed taking a couple graduate courses in Machine learning/DS at my University and performed well in these.  I have since had the itch to do research in these areas (I have been especially enjoying bandits and reinforcement learning in general due to their deep mathematical roots). All the research related jobs/internships I have looked at so far seem to require either a graduate degree in CS or publications in ML (which I do not have due to being new in this field)

My questions are as follows: Is it realistically possible to find a research position in this field with my background, without a second PhD? Should I just go into applied DS/data engineering in industry instead?

I wanted to know what my practical career options are. I was thinking it would be nice to apply my research background in math to doing research in Data Science, but I realize this would be hard to sell.

This made me curious though, because they seem to be using a similar, but different definition of overfitting than I typically use. I'm curious what other people tend to think of overfitting as. The two primary definitions I've seen:

1) A model is overfitting when (during the course of training) the validation error begins to increase while the training error continues to decrease.

2) A model is overfitting when (after training) the validation/test error is much larger than the training error.

Personally, I see the 2nd definition as being more true to what overfitting actually is, and is also the more practical of the two. Overfitting is a tool that can be used to determine how to continue hyperparameter searching in the right direction (for example, introducing regularization if there is high overfitting). Whereas the first definition, seems more like a vanity point.

It seems to me that it is spurious to make a claim like 'boosted models don't overfit' because that would imply that they don't ever need to be regularized in order to achieve the best performance, which seems patently false.",58,77,False,self,,,,,

I'm looking for a solution for what I think is probably a common problem with categorical data in Sklearn. When it comes to model proto-typing, I am typically an R user but have been developing software in Python for about 7 years.

I want to create a single decision tree for a task. The majority of the data are categorical features. The decision tree is going to be used by people rather than a machine, so keeping the depth of the tree limited is important.

In R, we have the factor data type as a way to encode categorical features. When a split in the tree (using the rpart package) is made, it can take multiple factor levels into account for one split. For example, you might see a split being 'Browser = Chrome or IE or Firefox' where we essentially use one split for three levels of the factor.

If we compare that to Sklearn - there is no factor data type. All the suggestions I've seen have been to use one-hot/dummy variables, which is fine... except, the same situation now takes three separate splits -- 'Browser = Chrome', 'Browser = IE', and 'Browser = Firefox'. Given that I need to keep the depth of the tree limited, this feels like an inefficient use of my depth 'budget'.

However, Sklearn provides a more convenient hyperparameter tuning scheme, particularly for decision trees, and most of my colleagues are pretty much entirely Python users exclusively. Is there any other encoding method, package, or workflow that can help me solve this problem with Python/Sklearn? I know pandas has a 'categorical' data type, but IIRC it just maps the levels to a sequential integer, which has its own set of problems.",14,24,False,self,,,,,

""With tf.Session() as sess: ....."" etc etc

Basically, I'm following a standard MNIST tutorial I found online, but I'm trying to repurpose it with my own data as that will help me understand it better (and also, i dont work with image data that much, so I'm using a logistic regression type problem (predicting 0's and 1's).

The part of the code that I dont get is this:

            for epoch in range(hm_epochs):
                epoch_loss = 0
                for _ in range(int(mnist.train.num_examples/batch_size)):
                    epoch_x, epoch_y = mnist.train.next_batch(batch_size)
                    _, c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={x: epoch_x, y: epoch_y})
                    epoch_loss += c
    
                print('Epoch', epoch, 'completed out of',hm_epochs,'loss:',epoch_loss)

This is after you set up all your layers, and after you initialize session and the global variables.

I dont understand lines 3 through 5.

what is ""\_"" and what is mnist.train.num\_examples/batch\_size?

what is mnist.train.next\_batch(batch\_size)?  

Basically, if I was using my own data (X\_train, X\_test, Y\_train, \_test, I dont know what to put in place of the ""mnist"" sections.

in the tutorial, I dont think I saw ""mnist.train.num\_examples"" or mnist.train.next\_batch get declared anywhere, so I'm not sure where those came from.  Are these variables or are these methods off of the variables?

Im not very sure if this is the right place to post but I feel that someone might be able to throw some light. 

 Im a psychologist and I have been working in the HR department of a big company for almost 3 years. I pretty much manage employees data, but lately I have been assigned with more ""data"" related task (reporting, metrics, simple data visualization, some ""analytics""). My boss (after seeing that I have slightly more hard skills than my fellow coworkers) even told me about implementing Power BI to improve our data visualization. 

So, taking in consideration that current trends in the job market (and that I would like to become a more appealing talent for overseas companies in the future) I have decided to take this opportunity and start developing some data skills. The problem is that... theres so much information and so many paths that I could choose thats kinda overwhelming. 

After doing some reading, I have narrow down two paths that I, somehow, could use my previous HR experience or knowledge of the business and find interesting: People Analytics and Business Intelligence. Now, the thing is I dont know where to start or which one should I start developing first or which one could open more job opportunities for me and so on...

I am part of the Project Data Analytics Community that hosts free meet-up data science/analytics events in London, Manchester, Bristol an Aberdeen. In Dec 2017 we set up a meetup to help transform how we leverage data to transform how projects are delivered. We have grown it to a community of 4,000 people and hope to extend it to 10,000 by end 2020.  

I have been working with my CEO, Martin Paver, to establish a pipeline of talks for our meet-ups in the various regions where we are seeking speakers and attendees who can help to inspire and move the deal on advanced data analytics within a project context. We understand that digital transformation is undergoing exponential growth, and would like to hear from beginners, students and academics to add a breathe of fresh air to the community, or even professionals who are thought leaders in project delivery. This may be in construction, medicine, energy, engineering, life sciences and so on. 

The meet-ups are free with pizza provided! we think they are a great way for students and professionals to build their professional networks with other Universities and members from numerous data science and industry organisations. We are hopeful that the community can grow, its just a matter of finding like-minded people to drive the quest. 

Thank you,

In any case, I feel like I don't know enough statistics. All my courses felt so theory based. Prove X Y Z. This is how you derive X from Z, memorize this and prove it in an exam. Use the MGF of this distribution to prove this joint distribution, etc.

To be honest, most of that stuff went over my head. I passed the courses, but it felt more like me memorizing the proofs and writing it down with small manipulations to fit the exam. Regardless, I feel like in the real world I'll be working with data sets, data collection, manipulating it, cleaning it, analyzing it, etc. And I know none of that.

I have a strong background in computer science as well if that matters. So, what should I do? I got around half a year left of school to go and I'm looking for some more courses I can take online to help me out.

Thank you!

PS. I've taken a regression course which was a little applied. There were a ton of proofs but we also learned how to apply linear regression and multi variable regression. Currently I'm taking a course called Data Collection that's pretty applied and quite nice, it's teaching different sampling techniques which seems applicable to real life. Next semester, I'm taking my final stats course called ""Intro to applied statistics"" so maybe that will teach me what I'm looking for, but I doubt it haha.",1,0,False,self,,,,,
