I'm an econ/math undergrad. I've taken a few stat classes but haven't gotten to much of the higher level math stuff yet. I'm interested in getting involved with data science, and I'm looking for tips to find an internship.

I've been taking some Coursera modules (social media network analysis, data mining, intro to data science...), I've nearly finished the Java and Python modules on Code Academy, and I started a blog in January where I make weekly posts doing some sort of analysis, so far most of it has been stat based and inside of Excel (pivot tables and charts).

I'm really eager to learn which is why I've been taking all these outside classroom lessons. I'll hit up some more advanced courses in the fall but I was really looking for a chance to do something over the summer.

I was wondering if there might be some way to approach companies that aren't obvious choices for more qualified students (like IBM) where I could get a chance to get some experience.

I'm incredibly confused.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1epnpc/is_anyone_in_the_coursera_datascience_course_im/,[deleted],1369078105,"The forum for the course is pretty dead so I'm hoping that maybe someone in here is in the course. I am stuck on the 1st assignment, question 2.

For anyone else here's a quick run down of the situation:
--we created a print.py script to parse the twitter api and spit out the last 10 tweets (removing all the other junk from the api)

-- we used a framework .py file to pipe a stream of tweets to a turn_in.txt file with the top 20 lines of that pipe

-- **QUESTION 2**
-- we need to run:
     $ python tweet_sentiment.py &lt;sentiment_file&gt; &lt;tweet_file&gt;
 to spit out a line with the tweet matched with this sentiment file we're given.

I created the script up to the point where I can take a string and run it through the sentiment file, but I can't get how to import the tweet and sentiment files as imputs like this and then use them in the main script.

here's more information that's given. If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear it., I'm not sure if I should post this here or in the /r/python subreddit.
&gt;
&gt;To use the data in the AFINN-111.txt file, you may find it useful to build a dictionary. Note that the AFINN-111.txt file format is tab-delimited, meaning that the term and the score are separated by a tab character. A tab character can be identified a ""\t"".The following snippet may be useful:
&gt;
&gt; 
    afinnfile = open(""AFINN-111.txt"")
    scores = {} # initialize an empty dictionary
    for line in afinnfile:
    term, score  = line.split(""\t"")  # The file is tab-delimited. ""\t"" means ""tab 
    scores[term] = int(score)  # Convert the score to an integer.
    print scores.items() # Print every (term, score) pair in the dictionary
&gt;

the provided framework file has this bit of code in it as well:

def hw():
    print 'Hello, world!'

def lines(fp):
    print str(len(fp.readlines()))

def main():
    sent_file = open(sys.argv[1])

I just have a couple of questions which I'm hoping that the reddit community can answer for me.

1) Have any of you been involved in any projects centered around health analytics? If so, did you enjoy your experience(s) ?

2) Which healthcare sectors have the strongest demand for business intelligence / analytics services? Upon speaking to some people, it seems that business with health insurance and healthcare providers is doing well

3) Are there any case studies out there regarding health analytics ?",0,1,False,default,,,,,
