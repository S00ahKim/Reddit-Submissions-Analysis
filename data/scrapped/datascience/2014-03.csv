So far we haven't had much luck with the model, the variables aren't turning out to be significative. We've tried using speeding violations, continous driving requirements, frequency of route change (if a driver does many routes or only one), frecuency of vehicle change, age, years of experience, marital status, amount of night shifts and psychological tests score. All of these using a logistic regression model.

Any chance any of you have come across a paper that could help, or have any suggestions? Also, we've been wondering what would be a good time interval, both for the input and the output.

I have read previous posts on this, but I am not sure if they answered my questions; so am posting anew. Sorry for the long post.

I went to top 5 CS university for grad school in a research focused program, and have a MS with major in ML/ NLP. I also published often in various conferences and was fortunate enough to have worked and authored with some big names in CS.

Unfortunately my last paper was in mid 2011, and I drifted to working on my startup. It involved some NLP/ IR work, but a lot of it was grind work, and other non data-ish things that were quantitative in nature like image processing and combinatorial optimization. We have been mildly successful in terms of users, press and revenue. Though nothing spectacular by big exit standards.

I had to recently move back to my home country due to family issues, and am no longer involved with the startup. Though I am helping the rest of the team transition for future product pipeline. And now I have to look for a more conventional job, which brings us to my questions.

I have around six years of engineering experience post undergrad, split about evenly between academia/ research labs and the startup. Academia work also included working on live projects with sizable user base besides more pure experiments driven research work. But I have never worked in a normal corporate setting. And I also don't have a specialized engineering expertise. I have done everything from mobile[1] and web development to building recommender systems and optimizing elasticsearch to improve relevance.

[1] This was primarily for the startup that included a very well reviewed app that was featured by Apple multiple times. Though I focused on harder algorithmic code and a team member lent hand for most UI/UX/API work.

--

I would love some general advice for me. Also posting some specific questions here:

- How much does my general background hurt my chances and for what roles? Does my experience in semi-managing technical teams help?

- I am taking a break of a few months to realign my career; also doing some side projects. How badly is that viewed?

- I have almost no knowledge of R/ SAS. Is it really important? Especially with the growth in scikit/ pandas community. Not great at them either, but am catching up fast.

- Among broad data science tasks, I think I am least experienced in data munging. Any good pointers for that? I have started practicing on Kaggle.

- I would prefer moving back to the US in near term. How hard would it be to interview directly there? I have reasonable contacts and an approved work visa, but not sure if someone will interview at all sitting on the opposite end of the world.

Thank you for the attention; x-posted to /r/machinelearning.

One thought is to track each user's accuracy over time and then weight their future guesses depending on their past accuracy. It seems possible but I don't know where to begin translating this to real data science. I broke it down into a few key questions.

1. How is a user's accuracy calculated on a per item basis?
2. How is a user's accuracy over time represented?
3. How is a user's appraisal weighted against the others based on their past accuracy?

My attempted answers so far.

1. Accuracy is based on the proximity of their guess to the actual sell price. I was thinking the absolute value of the difference between the guess and the sell price divided by the sell price would give a coefficient of proximity. Smaller ~ more accurate.

2 &amp; 3. I've been reading up on reddit's sorting algorithms and although their interesting they don't seem to match up to this problem well because they're based on binomial data and not proximity.

I learned how to use SQL, SPSS, excel, r, python, and rapid miner. I also know front end Web coding.

Since then I have lived off odd jobs and bitcoin trading, for which I used some excel analytics. I the thing is I don't have any references as I was self employed. I do have a portfolio I could show employers but it's nothing amazing. 

Will I be able to get a data science job like this? Just something entry level. I could even volunteer for the first month or something. I'm trying to avoid getting another degree as I really can't afford it. Is there some other path I could take? I'm willing to move to the bay area but I could only live there for 2 months without a paying job. I really want to move there anyway.

What can I do? I love analysis, I'm good at it, and I just don't think my life should be over because I didn't get a traditional job right out of college. How can I prove to employers hiring a 25 year old guy with no references is worth it?",22,5,False,self,,,,,
