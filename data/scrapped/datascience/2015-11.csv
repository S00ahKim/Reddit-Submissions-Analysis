So long story short, I will be interviewing for a 12 month internship at an [eBay Classifieds](http://www.ebayclassifieds.com/) company for a Strategy and Analytics role - the role description is here: http://i.imgur.com/7pZqWvo.png

As you can see, it's a typical analytics role with SQL and Excel, which initially I was really happy with, since I have prior experience with both through school and my last internship. However, last week I interviewed with an Investment Bank and when the guy saw my resume, he basically grilled me for having Excel and VBA and told me I should not learn such backward, 90s technology and instead use fancy machine learning algorithms via R, Python, Matlab etc. to do my analysis or ""data science""

From what I've understood, data science is essentially a higher level of analytics and is used for prediction/forecasting/looking into the future? I wanted to bring this up at my interview, and ask whether it would be possible for me to explore some data science in this analytics role but I was wondering how I could possibly motivate it for this specific company (a classified sites)?

I was thinking of saying something like ""we could look at a user's previous purchases and then make recommendations"" but I was wondering if the rest of you could tell me, in very simple terms, **what can data science accomplish that analytics via Excel/SQL cannot uncover?**

Thank you!! 

**Edit**: I'm in my third year of Industrial/Systems Engineering with a focus in Information Engineering, so I've taken a fair bit of probability/statistics (stochastic processes, hypothesis testing, distribution fitting, regression analysis etc.) as well as programming, e.g. Java, C, VBA, SQL. I've also taken introductory operations research (linear, integer, mixed, network, dynamic programming) so hopefully my background is strong enough to (potentially) get started in ~data science~",16,8,False,self,,,,,

Have been working in data science for some time, longtime lurker of the subreddit for awhile as well.  

Wanted to get some thoughts from everyone on your data collection techniques present with productionizing a predictive  model.   

Most others I talk to don't face the same concerns since they can batch score the events they are dealing with. The scenario I'm facing though is scoring on the wire (i.e. An event arrives and we need to score it an deliver a result real-time). 


The largest technique I've been using is to implement pre-model data collection in a very flexible node.  So in a sample flow:

*  Event comes in. 
*  It hits an sql layer
*  I've pre compiled all of the attributes I would need to derive inside of this database
*  select statements run against tables
*  Enhance the event with new attributes from the output of queries
*  Pass final set to model implementation layer. 


Think about something like an event with IP address or customer. I would be enhancing the event with IP address country, customer name, customer tenure etc.  

The logic for how to retrieve the values are stored in configuration objects - so they can easily updated to include new tables and columns as they are added into the database. 

Anyone else dealing with similar concerns in your environment?  Any implementations that you have liked?

I want to get away from hard coding anything as much as possible. Curious to get other opinions. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Ive had this idea for a little while now and wanted to share it to get some thoughts.

Im calling it Project: Shade.  If youre in an area where you see something shady going on but would otherwise not call 911, you log into this app and alert authorities.  This information could then impact the typical patrolling route that police officers take.  Essentially replacing randomness and gut feelings that guide patrols to something even slightly data driven.  Waze for crime.

At the very base, this app could help guide police in an effort to have a more proactive approach.  The next step would be to use the app and other aggregated data to create a product, for police departments, that is data driven and can help reduce crime.  

Hope to hear any thoughts you all might have on the app itself and using aggregated data to help proactive policing.

Thanks!

As a newbie, I'm just looking for some career advice or experience from people who have a better grasp of the field. 



My main questions relate to how my current / desired skill set would fit for a job in data fields (perhaps specific sub-fields are relevant).



So let me start off by introducing. Currently I'm doing a PhD (one year in) in Marketing, specializing in Consumer Behavior. I have a  a Master of Science in the exact same field as my PhD, and a Bachelor in Business Administration (Marketing).  I'm based in Europe and aged 24; suffice to say I'd be looking for an entry level position. 



I should note that most ""true"" data science job offerings around here ask for quantitative degrees (math, comp sci, econometrics, physics) but I feel with the shortage of analytical talent and other supposed requirements (programming, business acumen, whatever) that's probably wishful thinking. 



So I don't have a technical or engineering degree, my background is mostly in business/marketing and consumer psychological areas (think more in lines of surveys/experiments and market research but then in a more academic view to analyse consumer preferences etc.). 



My ""field"" is relatively quantitative in nature (although it isn't exactly math/econometrics/machine learning), focussing on univariate and multivariate statistics (over econometric/Bayesian models, etc, although I'm not sure how big the differences are. Doing a PhD/having a Master's I am familiar with experimental designs and hypothesis testing. 



 I have knowledge of calculus (university level) and statistics (basic/multivariate and research methods). These include: linear and multiple regressions, t-tests and such, ANOVA (and variants), General Linear Models, hierarchical clustering (we use it for market segmentations etc), conjoint analysis, principal components analysis/factor analysis (used for perceptual mapping analyses) and some other dimension reduction methods like correspondence analysis. Usually, most methods are based on linear regression in one way or another. 



During my studies I've done internships in the online marketing, particularly in Web Analytics (I have the Google Analytics certificate). During those web analytics days I particularly did the metrics/dashboard reporting stuff paired with visualizations in Tableau.



I normally conduct statistical analyses using SPSS. Right now however I'm learning R (through DataCamp courses), including programming, statistics, visualizations, machine learning concepts and the whole shebang. 



If I were to stop my PhD programme, I'd plan to drop roughly 1000 USD on additional courses to get into the data field. I'd be including (probably):

- the Data Science specialisation on Coursera

- Python programming (to compliment R)

- a course on Econometrics/modelling (I don't have any experience with this) 



So to get to my questions:



- would this plan be a decent/feasible one to get me started a job into data science-esque fields?

- specifically, what types of jobs would I best qualify for? my understanding is ""data science"" atm is very multidisciplinary so I may be better suited for some functions over others. (personally I'm thinking a marketing/business oriented position in e-commerce analytics/science or comparable). I'm looking at this broadly, so really just any kind of analytical function that would fit with my background.

- do you have any other recommendations of courses or similar that are important to further develop my skillset? Unfortunatel I can't do another Master's (really expensive and most ""pure"" data science require Bsc's in mathematical/comp sci. fields.

Tbh my academic career consisted mainly of economics courses, where I learned to use excel and  Stata, and one data mining course where I worked mainly with rapidminer. I suggested to look to at types of data in order to choose the right algorithm and to tune it in order to increase its efficiency, then I thought that maybe by increasing the computational power the processes would be faster but I know for sure that there are many more ways to increase efficiency.

I'm a kind of novice in this data engineering field.
I'm learning statistical learning these days using python's pandas and scikit-learn library and they're fantastic tools for me.
I could learn the way of classification, regression and also clustering with them of course.

But, I do not know how can I start with them when I would like to make a recommendation model.
For example, if I have a customer's purchase dataset, which contains date, product name, product maker, price, order device etc...

What is the problem type of recommendation? classification, regression, or anything else?
In fact, I could find out there are very famous algorithms like collaborative filtering when someone has to solve this problem.
If so, can I use those algorithms using scikit-learn? or shuld I have to learn another M.L libraries?

Our datasets (about 4 or 5), contain mostly similar data, but since the situations in which the data is captured is different, the context of the data is different between each data set. But, there is definitely benefit from being able to see how a trend in one data set may be popping up in another data set.

At the moment, the only common fields that we can makes effective Unions are the date fields for when the observation is captured. Our data sets contain common columns like Product or Defect, but as I mentioned above, the situations in which these are captured are slightly different for each data set that some of the column values are the same and some are different.

What we're looking to do is develop a dashboard that connects to all of these databases (we will likely try to use Tableau). We're looking to include pareto charts, bar charts, counts, and other visualizations of the data.

The problem is that we don't have common fields in each of the data sets to perform a Count on a specific Defect or Product.

My question is more process related - like what should our first step be?
1) Should we try to first clean up how our data is stored and create a field across each data source that is entered identically across each of the datasets?

Hi all, 

I just graduated this past year with a BSc in Psychology (minor in Biology). Although I'm aware this isn't the conventional background, I came to love working with data and really became interested in pursuing data science as I progressed through my degree.

I was very fortunate to get lots of research experience with several different neuroscience and cognitive psychology labs (including completing a data-intensive thesis). I also have programming/scientific computing experience from coursework and research positions, namely working with MATLAB and R. As well, I did really well in all of my statistics courses, and even took two graduate-level seminars (in computational neuroscience and structural equation modelling/PCA). 

I spent this past summer expanding my skillset by getting more familiar with machine learning, SQL, as well as learning Python (which I love; it is now my go-to 90% of the time). I *love* learning this stuff and I'm driven to continue learning and expanding my knowledge/skillset while working. Simply put, if I don't know something, I learn it. 

But, **I'm really struggling to get my foot in the door**. I'm in a major Canadian city where data science isn't really recognized; all the jobs are 'data analyst', BI or database-type positions. Indeed, it seems that an analyst is synonymous with RDBMS + CS degree: all the jobs I can find require CS or related degrees and want people with generally a minimum 5+ years of experience. I've only had one job interview, and they told me they wanted a developer instead. I'm doing my best to network (meetups, coffee, etc) but that hasn't produced any leads either.

I'm starting to look elsewhere, but given that I'm just starting out, it's hard to apply to jobs in other cities where I don't have any connections. As well, a lot of these positions are high-level and prefer individuals with masters or PhDs. All I'm interested in, really, is some sort of entry-level or internship where I can start out and learn to do what it takes. I'm confident I can do a good job, I'm just looking for the opportunity.

Does anyone have any advice, ideas, or connections? Thanks and apologies for the rant!

These experiences usually occurred when the the job requirements were mis-classified as a data scientist instead of a software engineer.

From my experience, startups usually had the most well rounded interview processes. They were, for the most part, a mix of code days and one on one interviews to explain your approach. Maybe the bigger companies have time constraints on the hiring process, because most of them felt quite rushed and one-sided.

I've been trying to come up with a design for a churn model but keep getting stuck.
Let's say I have ~500K records of customers with a number of fields who are all currently subscribed to us. Customers can churn at any time and what I want to do is predict which of these customers are likely to churn away based on the customers who churned the previous month(or 2/3 months previous)

What I thought of doing originally was treat it as a rare event and run the model every month with ALL the current customers as a 0 for churned and the ones who churned the previous month as a 1. 

This wouldn't work as when I try to predict which customers are likely to churn I'm essentially predicting on the same customers I built the model with.

So would a solution be to simply build the model on a subset of my data and then predict on whatever I do not include in the training phase or is there another solution I have not thought of.

I'm a recent graduate from a state school with a major in Accounting, but am trying to make the shift towards Technology as of late. I'm currently working as a Business Analyst intern at a major F500 company, they mentioned that they want to extend my internship and place me in either the BI or Finance team. 

I have very functional understanding of technology, and I'm not technical at all. I think data science is super cool but I'm afraid that I'm just going to not know anything, or if it's even a good fit.  Many people have recommended starting with the Data Science specialization courses on Coursera, but I'm not sure where to start and how to prioritize what things to learn first. I'm also a conceptual learner, so it seems like a lot of the courses are very too structure/academia focused. 

**Questions:**

* What other resources are there?

* Is there any progression for understanding the Business side? Or is it all just technical or out? 

* Where should I start? Do I start with SQL? Python?

The ETL/reporting tools my company use are mostly Access, Informatica, and Cognos if that helps.


**Goals** 

* try and get into consulting (Mck, BCG, Deloitte) on the Business Tech Ops side, is data science aligned towards this at all?

Thanks, any advice is appreciated!

My company works in the online space and we sell subscriptions. Weve been selling subscriptions since like 2011. My boss wants me to figure out what average monthly tenure is of our subscribers is going back to January of 2013. So on January 2013, it was X and February of 2013, it was Y and so on. 

What I did was pull a master list of every subscription that was ever purchased and then I determined if it were active on January 31, 2013. If it was active, I took the total days that have passed between 01/31/2013 and when it was purchased. So if a subscription was purchased on 12/1/2012, it would be 62 days. If it were still active at the end of February, it would be 90 days (62 + 28 days in February). Once it cancelled, it stopped calculating. So if hypothetically, that dude who purchased on 12/1/2012 was still active today, his total days would be however many days have passed between then and today.

So when all is said in done, I take by each month, the average of total days active, divided by 31 (to signify a month).

The problem is, when I try to calculate the average tenure of what it is right now, it gets way too high. Itll be like 22 months which I know is wrong. The average months on January 2013 is around 5.

Can anyone figure what, if anything, Im doing wrong? I feel like I should be accounting for the time that has elapsed since January of 2013.

EDIT:

My central problem is this.

The longer a subscription stays active, the higher amount of days it going to represent. A subscription that's only been active for 16 days in January of 2013 will be active for over one 1000 days in November of 2015. So because of that, it's creating inflated results that I don't believe to be accurate. 

For example, January 2013 accounts for 16687 subscriptions that are active at that time, which accounts for 2776478 total days active for all of those active subscriptions. If I take the average of those total days (166) and divide by 31 (to represent a month), I get 5.37. If I take the median (112) and divide by 31 I get 3.61. 

Now moving to November of 2015, we now have 5162 current active subscribers (yes, its a huge drop but it was more of a strategic decision.) The sum of those total days is 3622589. That accounts for all kinds of subscription duration's. Some that began their tenure with us back in 2012 and are well into the thousands (but were still young back in January of 2013). Some that began their subscription with us in say, May of 2014. Others that started in November of 2015. That's an average of 701 days per subscription, divided by 31 which is around 22.5 months. The median is 581, which divided by 31 is around 18 months. I know those figures are not correct. 

I feel like there's something I need to do for the time that has passed month-to-month. 

So I'm open to any and all suggestions.

I currently work as a pharmacy technician and I'm going to take my 2nd semester of accounting (principles of accounting 1 this winter 2016) and maybe a business course alongside it. I have been unsure about my place in society (I mean who isn't.. its not like we're all cookie cut to be in a specific role). I'm trying to find a career where I'd have the most free time (so 40 hour/week nothing too crazy like 60+ hrs) to do hobbies or spend time with family. What led me to this subreddit was reading a very tad bit about game theory, operations research, and data science, and possibly tying in these elements with engineering or going into one of these pathways (eng. included). The thing is I'm not too sure where I want to go in these fields. What can I do to narrow down my choices (take intro classes? any books?). I'm particularly asking advice for people who are in these fields to give me some advice. I'm not sure whether I will go into either pharmacy or accounting (narrowed down career choices to these two) so I'd like to see if this field could possibly be a back up. My unusual hobby is creating systems for pick 3 lottery. I like to look back into past draws and use filters to narrow down choices and find strategies of winning for current draws. I use other systems as well as programs that other people have developed to create systems that I can backtest (use on past draws) and see which are effective for current draws (I'm not amazing at it but with patience and a decent bankroll I can probably make good amount of money). So, if I had a career that was close to this hobby that would be a godsend. I was wondering if there were career fields related to this strange hobby of mine. What kind of fields/books/courses/anything (even free courses on courser I can register to) may I look into that are close to this hobby. Any possible careers related to this?

We basically want to connect non-tech savvy web owners with data scientists and analysts in order to optimise their websites. 

Analysts get paid and the website owners have a better website. It's a win win situation. 

Before we jump into creating something that no one wants we want to check the kind of information a data analyst's needs in order optimise KPIs like?

- Conversion rate
- Abandonment rates
- Site engagement
- Bounce rate

Additional things that would be cool to know are: 

If you as had full access to a google analytics dashboard would you be able to use the information to make recommendations?

What are the main metrics you'd want to measure for ecommerce websites? 

Would you need to set up A/B tests in order to glean more meaning from your analysis?

I took philosophy and economics in university during undergrad. In hindsight, I should have taken statistics and economics or computer science and economics, but what's done is done. I took every possible statistics and research class I possibly could (5 classes of econometrics, 2 classes in research design and analysis, 2 classes of empirical research methods).

Looking at what the value of my degree and skillset is, it seems like it's kinda close to what is required for data science. The problem is that most data scientists seem have a statistics or computer science background, which I lack on paper.

So my question is as follows - 

Do I absolutely need to go back and do a 2nd bachelor in stats and/or computer science in order to be employable?

With holidays fast approaching and with it the barrage of ""what do you do"" questions from family/friends/enemies/Santa/etc. -  I thought it would be interesting to hear how you all explain what a data scientist is to someone unfamiliar with the field/role.

Normally I avoid simply stating ""Oh, I'm a data scientist!"" and explain what I *actually* do on a day to day basis. If someone asks more bluntly what a data scientist is I frequently reference [Drew Conway's venn diagram](https://qualityandinnovation.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/drew-conway-venn.png) description. 

If that doesn't work I decide to be one of the following:

- ""a data analyst of sorts""
- ""I'm basically a developer""
- statistician (""...so where's your Phd???"")
- computer scientist
- designer
- model (*technically* data science involves modelling, therefore...)

tl;dr
How do you describe what a data scientist is?

I have classes that I use to build a Directed Graph, I have a class that I use to keep track of the probability distribution of a specific feature. For example, there are three weather classes and 34% of the training set is ""sunny"".

I also have another function that I can use to calculate conditional probabilities, but i have to pass the two sets that I'm interested in as well as the names of the two classes that are involved in my calculation. For example, if I have two data sets ""weather"" and ""temperature"" and I wanted to find the conditional probability P(sunny|cold) I'd have to pass both the weather and the temperature sets and then the names of the classes that I'm interested in.

However, I'm still not sure how to hook everything up in order to perform classification.

I was reading over a paper entitled [Comparing Bayesian Network Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6684.pdf) to try and get an understanding.

Let's say that I am trying to predict a person's sex based on the attributes height, weight and shoe size. My understanding is that I would have Sex as my parent/classification node and height, weight and shoe size would by my child nodes.

This is what I'm confused about. The various classification nodes only keep track of the probability distribution of their respective attributes, but I'd need the conditional probabilities in order to perform classification.
