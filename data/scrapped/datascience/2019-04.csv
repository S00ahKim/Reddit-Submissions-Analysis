I am currently majoring in Business Analytics in the National University of Singapore. 

This are the skillsets that my major focuses on:

1. Java and python programming methodology (Functional Programming, solving problems sets etc)
2. How to visualise data using Tableau
3. Linear Algebra and Calculus
4. Basic Programming with R
5. Mysql as a database management tool

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on, my course will begin to specialise in specific concepts such as marketing analytics. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to ask what do you guys think of the course and how importance is it to understand stuff like Entity-Relational Databases (for example)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a little ambiguous and certainly dependent on the specific project and/or field, but I want it to be open ended. Interpret it as you will.

Personally, I am sort of a ""hobbyist"" data scientist (I am a biologist; my ""data science"" type work is all on my own time), so all of the ""data science"" type things I do are exploration of open source biological data (RNA seq, protein-protein interaction databases, anything on the Allen Brain Institute's website; i.e. ""data-science-lite""). I'm usually testing out one-off ideas, looking for interesting ways to combine open source data, and seeing if I can gain any insight into my own project. 

I generally have separate directories for raw and transformed/joined data. I keep scripts in the directory in which they were applied to make it easier to keep track of what I did at each step of the process, and I keep exploratory/debugging notebooks in the parent directory. I also try to keep metadata files in each raw and transformed directory, but to be overly honest I am the only person working with any of it, so I tend to slack quite a bit on creating the metadata.

I haven't come up with any naming schemes that seem to work for me consistently, and since it's just me exploring data to see if I can use it for my own projects, I generally have no need to break it into smaller pieces to be executed by a team.

My approach has a lot of short-comings. In particular, I end up with data files haphazardly named and scripts spread chaotically throughout the whole directory structure. I can usually trace my way back to what I did, but it takes some time. This is particularly problematic when I try to return to a project with a new idea; I spend as much time remembering what I did previously as I do executing the new idea.

I'm just curious what you all do to structure your projects. I've not seen much here in the way of describing best practices in organizing personal or professional projects, so I thought I'd toss the question out to the community.",4,10,False,self,,,,,

So I might get laid off and am trying to plan for if that happens. My background is in sales, marketing and product management. 

I know bootcamps are frowned upon here but if I get laid off I have to do something and I want to get a quick result in the time Ill be getting severance.

Id like to position myself to get into a more technical role - either a product manager at a tech company or a data science analyst.

If I get laid off Im planning to do GAs data science full time (or software eng program). I dont have confidence that I could learn and build a portfolio on my own.

If I put my all into the program what are my chances of getting a job and how much would it pay approx?

It is a rather long post but i realy need your guidance. I feel trapped right now. 

Let me intoduce myself: 

I am a 4th year student at one of Turkey's best universities, studying math with a 3.25 gpa. I will graduate next semester i hope. I came to my university to be a math professor, but the things have changed. I was lazy and procastinated everything for the first two-three years of my studies. It is due to depression and anxiety. I recovered a lot since then but not completely, i believe. For the last year or so I don't want to be a mathemathician, because i think i am not great at it. Recently, i begin to think a data science career would be great for me. 

The problem is i didn't have any courses related to D.S other than Probabliity and introductory C++, don't know any programming language, and didn't have any internships. 

My escape plan:

I think doing a MS. in computer engineering in our school, or better, doing a M.S related to Data Science in Europe would be my best plans (I would reaaly love to work and live in Europe). However, i have to support myself by working while studying, since i don't have any money. So i thought studying in a public German university while working would be the only choice i have in this situation. (I don't know German, too :D). For example, Munich Technical University has a Mathemathics in Data Science Master program. But it would be hard for me to get accepted,  i believe.

So, are my plans sound reasonablewhat are my plans? Or what are other German, or European schools can i apply, and support myself while studying?

**""What are the qualities or traits which differentiate good data scientists from the best data scientists? How, if at all, can these traits be learned or acquired?""**


Panelist Answers:
_______________________________________________________
/u/creampuffcrusader:

The best data scientists I've worked with had these two traits:

**A deeply rooted paranoia about data quality.**

Starting out a project by trying to replicate KPIs and current domain knowledge before jumping into the new and exciting work. Talking to stewards of the data about any quirks they ran into and taking the time to understand the data generating process. This can be learned either from mentor-ship or from experience. For me personally - it was combination of both mentorship and collecting battle scars.

**Holding themselves to the scientific method***

I had a mentor who was a data scientist before it was cool. He started the quantitative supply chain practice at the firm I work in back when the data scientist equivalent position was called Principal Analyst. He had this motto when interviewing stakeholders:

Tribal knowledge is a hypothesis unless there is evidence.
He had this uncanny ability of organizing knowledge by what has been verified, what can be verified, and what is interesting but maybe out of scope or not testable. And using this categorization to efficiently guide us to a quality analysis or product. Really - he was just very strictly holding himself and his team to the scientific method. It was remarkable.

This trait can definitely be learned. But it takes patience and experience.

_______________________________________________________
/u/amadeusmagrabi:

In my experience, the best data scientists are the ones who have **an intrinsic drive to deliver value for the business** and are **able to think outside the box to make sure that the whole team has the highest impact.**

Good data scientists ask their manager what the project requirements are, do their research, deliver a clean and thorough analysis, communicate their most important findings clearly and then ask what they should work on next.

Great data scientists take a more active approach and think about their work with more context. They ask what the larger goal of the project is and challenge the core assumptions. They have ideas for how a project could also benefit other parts of the company or raise awareness for potential conflicts that could occur down the line. They are informed about new frameworks or techniques that come out and suggest innovative ways how they could be used to improve a process. They are genuinely interested in how the business as a whole works and actively talk to people to understand their perspectives. They are full of ideas of what they should work on next. They pride themselves on how many people they helped and not on how complicated the technique they used was.

Importantly, they do all of this because they care about the impact of their work and not because they want the attention or boost their career. They do not start a discussion just for the sake of having a discussion and they are able to step back when their opinions did not resonate with others.

*As to how to acquire these skills:* 

If you do not have a data science job yet, this is hard to prepare. But it helps to read blog posts in which companies from different industries share how they get value out of their data (there are plenty of those on Medium).

Once you have a job, ask as many questions as possible without being too annoying and talk to everyone in the company. Do not be shy and just sit in front of your data. Constantly ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing, if it still makes sense or if there is a better way. Get involved, be curious and let others know about your thoughts. The more feedback you get on your thoughts, the better you can fine-tune your work to the business context.

_______________________________________________________
/u/tsutomu45
 
This depends on the role of the data scientist and the company.

In a tech company where seconds (and milliseconds) matter, then your knowledge of algorithms, statistical learning, and programming matters a lot.

However, if you're in a non-tech company, where data scientists tend to be more ""decision scientists"", and the transactions happen across days or weeks (think buying a car), then the ""soft-skills"" tend to dominate...things like understanding the business, iterating rapidly, and explaining results to non-math/non-engineering executives.

Both are learn-able. However, in my experience the latter (soft skills) are harder to teach.
_______________________________________________________
/u/dfphd:

There are three things that come to mind:

* **They are driven by outcomes and not methods - but can do either well.** 

The best data scientists I've met are the people that are willing to put their ego aside and cobble together a less elegant answer in two days than a more elegant answer in a week because that's what's right for the project. That's not to say that they cannot put together a complex, elegant solution to a problem - when the problem/project calls for it, they can roll their sleeves up and make that happen. But their bias is for getting results, not getting methodologies.

* **They say ""yes"" more often than ""no""**

It's really easy to say no. We can't do that, that can't be done, that won't work, no, no, no. Really good data scientists say yes - knowing that they may need to change the question for it to work, but understanding that they can likely figure something productive out.

* **They build strong relationships based on work credibility**

These people tend to do more than just be good at their job - they seem to always manage to leverage the quality of their work into really strong relationships at work, which in turn helps them be even more effective by having a lot of people who are willing to go to bat for them when needed. I think the first two attributes tend to help in building these relationships, but there is extra effort and time that they dedicate to cultivate these relationships over time.

Learning these skills, in my opinion, is largely driven by introspection, i.e., identifying that your objective should be to become as effective and efficient as possible, and that you may need to modify your behaviors, your habits, your comfort zone in order to become that person. Once you can legitimately convince yourself that these are skills worth developing, the rest becomes an exercise in keeping yourself honest - in constantly call yourself out when you are being a method-diva, when you're being a naysayer, and when you're marginalizing your relationships at work.",20,197,False,self,,,,,

Which one should I choose?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/b8skcv/2_job_offers_as_a_data_analyst_one_company_has/,redditisthenewblak,1554259563,"Apologies for the sorta long post!

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 job offers, and I can't decide between the two. For the sake of this post, the only factor I'm interested in is growth/learning opportunity. 

Of course, before anyone can actually practice any of the exciting buzzwords of DS, the company must have a process to get/clean their existing data, turn it into a format fit for analysis, and then implement the process for the entire company to use. Once the existing processes of data circulation have been improved for good, THEN can a DA/DS do the fun parts of their job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm more entry-level in terms of experience. I can code my way through SQL, R, and Python, but my PROFESSIONAL experience in those languages were limited to data manipulation, data viz, and data extraction (I do have some experience creating web-based tools in RShiny and Django for my company to use). Most of my experience actually using statistics, modeling, and ML in R and Python were academic in nature (i.e. data was already cleaned up AND all the features of interest were there, so no feature engineering, no API/scraping, no DB querying needed beforehand).

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I'd like to learn and where I'd like to grow: actually implementing those fancy algorithms I and so many others have learned, and using it to solve an actual business problem. 

One company (**Company A**) has already taken care of that whole ETL/data architecture problem: no complete overhaul of data circulation/storage/formatting necessary. That would give me more time to actually analyze the data rather than improve processes. Company A's Data department is also more mature, subdivided by different specialties of Data Science. As a Data Analyst in a more ""entry-level"" role, I'd start out doing more general work and/or writing SQL code, but I have the option to specialize in one specialty.

Furthermore, Company A has a solid mentoring system in place. I'd be paired with a more senior analyst or a data scientist in projects until I can stand on my own two feet.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, **Company B**'s Data team is much less mature. It's only a fraction of the size of Company A's. The manager started a few months ago, and the director of the Data team started less than a year ago. I would be my manager's first direct report ever. Because my manager's (and hence, *my*) division in Company B is fairly recent, we'd have to build the ETL processes from scratch. In fact, during my interview, that's what we'd focus on in this job. Once processes are in place, then we can focus more on stats/modeling/the more ""fun"" parts of DS. But how long is that going to take? A few months? A year? Company B's data (at least for my job's division) reside as Excel and PPT (yes, PPT) files, in multiple Sharepoint locations. The job would entail writing scripts to clean it all up and streamline the whole process -- assuming everyone in that division is on board with making the changes necessary. It won't be that way forever, but how long is that expected to be built out??

&amp;#x200B;

One potential advantage of Company B's job is upward mobility since it's small and young and I'd be one of the originals. Another would be impact; since we're a small team, my input would be valued.

&amp;#x200B;

So ultimately, what I want to know is: for someone whose objective is to learn and grow in their DS skills and practice, which environment would be better? Is there any advantage of joining a younger, less-established, smaller Data team with LOTS of data cleaning to do, but with higher impact, over a larger, more-established Data team?

I'm a high school senior who is in the process of deciding which college to attend! I got into UC Davis for Statistics and UC Irvine for Cognitive Science (but I'm looking into switching to Data Science! UCI doesn't have a Statistics major, but they do offer it in the form of a minor). I'm personally more interested in attending UCI, but I'm not sure if their not having a Statistics major will be a setback that is big enough to discourage me from going.

I know there's a lot of discussion about a Data Science major just being all hype and that it's better to major in something more broad, like Computer Science or Statistics. There's also the talk about poorly structured DS programs, but I'm not sure how to determine whether or not UCI's program is that or not. [Here](http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofstatistics/#majortext) are the required classes for their program (Drop down from ""Requirements for the B.S. in Data Science""). Is that lineup of classes comprehensive enough for me to be a relatively ""successful"" data science? If not, which fundamental skills are missing? 

Aside from that, if you have any insight on either school's Stats/DS programs (Davis also has a Data Science track within their Statistics major: [here are the course requirements](https://statistics.sf.ucdavis.edu/undergrad/bs-statistical-data-science-track)), I would really appreciate it if you could share your opinions with me! Also, if there are any DS skills that I can try to self-study over the summer before I start college, please share them with me. For reference, I've taken AP Statistics (Intro to Stats type class) and will probably take classes or self-study Python in the coming summer. ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Hello to all!

I have data in which there are 30 parameters and one target value. 10 parameters can be changed within certain limits, 20 parameters can not be changed, but must be considered (target value depends on all parameters). Some combinations of parameters give a large value of the target value, some give small values. Using Python and Keras (just 2 hidden Dense layers), I built a model that predicts the target value, taking into account all 30 parameters and it works without complaints.

Let a combination of 30 parameters come to us at one time. My model can predict the target value. How then to change 10 variable parameters so that the target value becomes as high as possible?? Only brute force comes to mind, but it can be extremely long.

Any ideas? Thanks!",1,1,False,self,,,,,

From what I've been led to understand, we take Decision Trees in sklearn. These trees ""weigh"" factors randomly during the training process. They do this repetitiously, and see what works to generate an accurate prediction on the test data, and what doesn't generate an accurate prediction on the test data. 

Decision trees can take multiple factors- say, car types. Weight, size, engine displacement, color, year. Then it tries to ""guess"" the blue book value of the vehicle- and we tell it ""if it's more than $1,500, then it's ""good."" (or ""1"".). If it's less or equal to, then it's ""bad."" (""0"").

Here's the some things I don't understand:

1: Can a decision tree weigh more than 2 things at a time? How do we tell it that ""value"" is what it's guessing by? The class examples we're given just keep on weighing only two features. (Maybe that's because it's easier to put on a powerpoint, IDFK.) 

2: What is our step in all of this? It determines what factors are important, and what factors aren't important, correct? Do we determine which factors to include and which to exclude? Do we just use reasoning (""why would color matter?""), or do we measure (""color has a relationship that is statistically significant according to the p-value, therefore we include it."")? 

3: We have a random slide that says ""Ensemble Methods. Bagging, Stacking, Boosting."" That's all it says, followed by some vocab terms that probably meant something to her, but are utterly meaningless to me. What on earth are those? What do those have to do with anything?

4: What makes a ""weak learner""? 

5: If accuracy isn't a good determinant of a model, then what is?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Bioinformatician that just finished his PhD in Systems Biology, with a particular focus on Graph theory applications to Omics data. I was born a Molecular Biologist and later started to love coding and programming (in , bu mostly, in Python). During these years, while developing automated pipelines and my methods, I started learning some basic statistics (real basic, sadly I wasn't given the right preparation during college) and I got acquainted some of the most basics concepts regarding data analysis and the way to visualize them properly. 

&amp;#x200B;

During these years I started getting tired/bored of the ""Bio"" part of bioinformatics and I have come to get more and more interested in data science (data wrangling, ML basics, clustering and other exploratory data analysis techniques such as PCA, I think you know this much much better than me"").

 I always got a ""glimpse"" of what was under the hood of the methods and the techniques I used, although most of the times I used a ""leap of faith"" approach to many techniques and topics I would have liked to know more in detail (and alas I did not, mostly because of time and deadlines, but I can't say I have not been lazy sometimes). 

Specifically, I found that I love math and statistics more than I thought, although, as I mentioned, I mostly understand it after I use some method rather than studying it from scratches.

Not that I finished my duties as a Bioinformatician (a job I'm still doing as a postdoc), I'm thinking to switch career and get more into Data Science. I'm not looking for jobs in the field (still), as I know I still have a lot to learn and to experience and at the moment my profile is not  very ""suitable"" for Data-science related jobs outside my field, but I'd really like to and this times I'm committed to change path.  

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I've applied to the \[Data Science Specialization\]([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-\]python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)) on Coursera and I'm struggling to follow it. I also bought some books mostly related to data wrangling to sharpen my knowledge of pandas and some of the R libraries I ""underused"" in these years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still wondering what I'm missing and how long it will really take to start applying for DS jobs, and what I can possibly expect. Do I need to apply for Internships first? Or can I apply to ""Junior"" positions? Is my knowledge already enough for covering some areas of expertise or I've just started? I'm very confused (and a little bit overwhelmed) by the amount of information and the huge diversity I found online, so I hope that you can help me clarify some of my doubts and concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need more information I'll be glade to give them to you, although for the moment I'd like to stay anonymous (I'm a little bit shy, I admit.)

In this case, are there tools I can leverage that can collect data from websites and convert them into CSV or something (guess this is called scraping)?  
If method (2) is ideal for a newbie like me, where's the best place to find data to work on.

isn't it just using a linear model (which they dismiss in section 2.2):

&gt;However, the linear model makes strong assumptions that are usually not satisfied in practice, i.e., the conditional expectation of the outcome metric is linear in the treatment assignment and covariates. In addition, it also requires all residuals to have a common variance.

but they use in analogy to control variates in montecarlo methods, by performing a t -test on difference to control variate.

and their recommended control variate is past value of the outcome metric - which has linear relation to  outcome metric (identity!) and similarly treatment effect is linear because they assume a constant effect. finally t-test assumes residuals have common variance.

I am studying a Business Degree and during an internship, where I worked with Google Analytics for the first time, I fell in love working with data. I have a little programming backgrounds (HTML, CSS, PHP 7) but nothing too extraordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i want to dive deeper and get more knowledge about Data Analysis. 

Sadly its difficult for me to know where I should start. Should I just learn basic Python first and then later increase my special knowledge for Data there? Or maybe even start with R?

 I found some guides by googling but some guides are starting already too deep into Python in my opinion. I also found the App Data Camp and try to do courses there every day.

* Getting a master's in data science. I can also do this in my city for a small tuition(also a public uni) and be done in a year and a half. They do accept Economics grads. The problem with this choice is that I can only ever be a data scientist/analyst (I really wouldn't like an Economics career)

&amp;#x200B;

Since completing my Masters in Data Science, I have had a number of people contact me asking for my experience with the course and whether it is worth recommending. Therefore, I thought it best to summarise my decision for starting the course, what I have achieved during my studies, and the outcome in the years following. I created this article for Medium but thought it would be good to post it here as well to help discussions as I often see questions about Data Science Masters and whether they are worth it. 

### Why did I choose to study DataScience?

It was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and I was gaining little to no coding experience.

It was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.

However, as I started to apply for Data Science roles it quickly became apparent that **I was lacking two key skills: applying Machine Learning and coding.**

### What were myoptions?

The first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on a CV to employers.

I considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and I was unsure of how repeating someone elses work would be received by employers. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately, boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.

Therefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business schools, was far more expensive at over 25,000 for one year of studying. The latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably less for the year at 9,000 (for UK citizen).

### What did Ichoose?

In the end, I decided to play it safe and commit a full year to the academic masters in the hope that I would gain the applied knowledge in machine learning and develop my coding skills through project work.

Therefore, I joined the 2016/17 cohort of the Data Science MSc at City, University of Londons Computer Science department. This was the second year the course was offered at this university and, at the time, was the only university in London that offered a Data Science Masters (though others had some variations of this).

### What did I learn in thecourse?

The first term consisted of the three main topics of Data Science: fundamentals of data science, machine learning and visualisations. Each module consisted of a coursework component that we were given a choice of any publicly available dataset to apply our newly learned methods on. With these, I was quickly able to improving my coding skills and even built the confidence to start sharing [these projects publicly](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2017/06/27/test/).

In the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures. I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first terms module) and Software Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced text data and natural language processing.

Over the two terms, I had been given a broad overview of most of the Data Science topics and had a deep knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks from the core modules. As we moved into the first component of the course, the dissertation, we were given the choice to complete this whilst in an internship role (and be provided an extension on the deadline to account for balancing whilst working). I found a suitable role, defined my research topic and over the following months applied all the skills I had gained so far towards [applying AI within business](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2018/03/09/masters-thesis-summary-constructing-a-narrative-using-markov-decision-processes-applied-to-data-visualisations/).

### Did I gain the skills I needed from thecourse?

I had two goals to achieve; to demonstrate that I understand machine learning and apply these with coding. The course not only provided a clear box tick against these on my CV but enabled me to continue to expand my skills after with more and more interesting projects. Part of any job application is to get past the initial checks and I was now doing this much more consistently. Furthermore, as I moved into interview stages, I had all these project to discuss and truly demonstrate confidence in my understanding far more than I would have achieved on my own.

The Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.

### What advice would I give to someone considering moving into DataScience?

This is always a hard question for me to answer as each persons position is different so will try to offer some advice based on my experience. In short:

1. **Establish** that Data Science is the right route for you and find a topic or detail to motivate this. For me, it was the ability to apply data analytics in a creative way and become a valuable asset in a business to help others improve their decisions.
2. **Evaluate** what the jobs you want are asking for and where your set of skills currently fall short. Although I had the technical background, I had not demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning or code and needed something to achieve this. For others on my course, they had not come from maths or stats backgrounds and so needed these to strengthen their knowledge.
3. **Review** the options available to you to gain these missing skills. For example, boot camps are increasingly more credible in the industry but they are often following a single path (i.e. learn on the same data and apply the same methods). This may work for some but I wanted to demonstrate my abilities in unique ways to stand out to employers. If you are considering a masters, thoroughly research the modules and who is organising the course as variations will exists between different departments, particularly business and academic schools.
4. **Expand and challenge** yourself through the course, dont simply pick a course that covers topics you are already comfortable with to tick a box. Find something challenging that will encourage you to develop new skills.
5. **Demonstrate** your new skills by publishing your projects online, either through GitHub or Kaggle or your own site. Building a portfolio of project has taken me further in any interview than trying to describe these within the time limit would allow.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you find this post useful if you are considering how to get into data science and will do my best to answer any questions you have about this. Am UK time so will most likely reply to questions tomorrow morning when I have some time.

I'm a Brazilian/Portuguese Geologist and I'm currently finishing a Masters in Petroleum Engineering. When I was in undergrad I did an internship for a startup company developing software for the O&amp;G industry and quickly fell in love with the programming and data related parts of the job.

So when I had to choose a topic for my undergraduate course thesis, I chose to do an statistical analysis of faults and fractures base don seismic data from a reservoir my advisor was working on. After I graduated I immediatly started working on my masters trying to develop geostatistical models for this same reservoir.

As I moved through the 2 years required for my masters I started to resent some of my decisions a bit, I hated academia, even though I love the field, I was not sure I wanted to work in O&amp;G, and specially, seeing the state of Brazil's Geoscience job market (to put it short, there are no jobs) left me thinking I had no options.

A couple months ago I stumbled onto this sub, and after reading a lot about data science I realised that this could be a field for me. From here stumbled onto [Stef Bernosky](https://towardsdatascience.com/@stefbernosky)'s blog covering her transition from Geology to data science and realised I was pretty much there already, heck, I was already applying neural network methods to classify reservoir areas and developing statistical models for some 3 years.

Flash forward a couple months and I just received my first few job offers, all of them related to data science in some capacity, some of them from companies I never thought I could work for (like Uber). I decided to accept the offer from a smaller local company as they offered me an actual data scientist position and higher pay. It's not a huge salary, as this is a third-world country after all, but I'll be way ahead of the curve compared to people with my experience in terms of salary.

So I'd like to thank this sub for making me realise that I could apply my knowledge to this field and the opportunities in it. I just hope I can leverage this as a means to someday leave Brazil and move back to Europe.",1,14,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking on the forums for quite a while and wanted some advice. I know that this topic has been discussed to death, but would just like to know your take on my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll give a little bit of background:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Graduated in 2017 from UCLA (Applied Math major, \~3.7 gpa, honors). This also included coursework for nearly an entire BS in Statistics and BA in Economics.
2. Worked the following roles:
   1. Data analyst in public policy (6 months, only Python and R usage and mainly data cleaning, model implementing, and NLP)
   2. De-facto Insurance agent in a tech startup (6 months; was told I would be doing analytics worked before I was hired ... lol; some very minor, non-coding analytics projects as well)
   3. Trying my own online ecommerce store (... 6 months, lol didn't go so well and I was an idiot for having idealized entrepreneurship in my head). 
3. I have come to realize that I want to go back into data analytics and progress into a data scientist role in the future without a doubt this time. I am not currently interested in data scientist roles with heavy research components (and am not likely to be qualified for these roles for quite some time if ever), but that could change in the future.
4. I would ideally like to stay in my next role for close to a year or 1+ years, so I'm ideally not trying to take a random job or end up back in insurance. I can continue to support myself off savings until August 2019.
5. Currently been searching for 2 months and only targeting data analyst roles in the Bay Area.
6. I have the beginnings of a github portfolio (of which not having previously likely probably hindered me), and have one project done so far (time series cleaning, data visualization, and coordinate mapping), with 3-4 planned for the end of the month (NLP, classification, image processing, more data cleaning). Hopefully this will help.
7. I've been lazy with regards to my career progression and have been too wishy-washy about it previously. I've started to make other changes in my life, and in conjunction am approaching whatever the next step I take with hopefully more discipline.

&amp;#x200B;

My options are as follows:

1. Get a Data Analyst job, continue to complete side projects, attend meetups, and apply for Data Scientist positions starting in 2020. I am currently interviewing for a few Data Analyst jobs in Silicon Valley (1 tech startup, 1 education startup, 1 consultancy). Currently unemployed for 2 months.
2. Go back to UCLA for an MS in Statistics. The program is heavily quantitative and theoretical, and is 2 years in length with a thesis requirement. Also, I can go virtually debt free or with minimal debt (&lt;$10,000 for the program length). Finish the program and look for a Data Scientist-esque job in 2021. I've already been accepted.
3. Go apply for a Data Science bootcamp that emphasizes real-world projects and learning more technology stacks (I lean away from this since it seems like with my background I would be mainly paying for guided-ish projects). Use the rest of my savings while taking the bootcamp.

&amp;#x200B;

Which option do you think is the best in my case? Thanks for all your advice!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to ask you a question about what should I do regarding my future (hope this is the correct place, if not feel free to tell me where should I post a question like this). Sorry all if my English isn't perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student who's going to complete his first degree cycle in Mathematics. Here where I live (Italy), after this first cycle of three years I should go for a second cycle of two more years. I could continue with a course in Mathematics, but I'm starting to think about taking a course in Data science instead. I'm still a lot dubious about this and I would appreciate some help.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all these are the reason I'm considering the option to change is because of job stability. Continuing with Mathematics would mean trying an academic career, which it happens to be a lot more difficult and less rewarding the more I'm close to it. I definitely love Mathematics and I could also say I'm pretty good at it (not a genius anyway, obviously), but the idea of basing my future upon a risk (you never know if you're actually going to obtain some good results which could open up my way) and of passing a lot of years through not stable jobs, until I can finally become a stable researcher / professor (which is not guaranteed anyway) is starting to make me want to try others ways.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I'm thinking about Data science. I must say that I like Data science, it wouldn't just be for career, statistics has always been something that attracted me. But I like Mathematics more, so choosing Data science would be primary for my future. Still I want to be sure. Obviously I'm looking forward two things: salary and, more importantly, stability. I want to be sure that Data science would actually guarantee me a stable job. If not a stable job at least a stable career, meaning that if I lose my job I wouldn't have many problems finding another one. Moreover I'm planning to move away from my country and I would like to know how much this could be an obstacle.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end is it worth taking a course in Data science regarding the stability of my future? Can I be sure that by studying this subject I could stop worrying about the uncertainty of my job?

I'd like to seek for advice regarding a situation. I'm not sure if this should be subreddit for advice but as my situation is related to the DS field, I thought it would be okay. 

I am 24M, and currently finished a master focused on DM and ML. I was having a though time finding a job in my country (not US) as ML is not that common. Making the story short, I was able to land a job as BI Developer / Data Analyst in a huge and international company. My job is with the help of our team to build the entire BI of the company, from redesigning the collection of data (from Excel to creating APIs) to presentation of data using tools like PowerBI. So far, they have me focused on designing the database models and also, preparing the BI reports (as the project already started when I wasn't here). It started like 2 weeks before I entered. Eventually they will send me to meetings to understand business questions. They are giving me the window that after that is done, we would work on implementing ML on what we built. They have been telling me that they want me to help in what I can and want. I have been working for this company for less than a week. 

Now, before getting here (a week before) I applied to one company with a position in ML (from collecting, designing and deploying ML algorithms using R, Python). It would be working under a person known here in the DS field. Company is a big company here locally. Different industry.

About benefits and salary, the ML base offer is similar to the one I am currently working. However, the one I am working has multiples economic benefits and non-economics too. Basically, the company I am currently working has a really good and better offer than the other company.

My issue is that I don't want to leave this company that has put so much trust in me with this small window, but I am afraid if being here means I won't be growing in the field. I don't want to destroy a bridge by leaving this fast.

About what I want, in my mind I want to do DS. I want to grow in my area but also helping companies in their decision area. I'd love to eventually go to US and work in the DS field. 

Sorry if something is not clear and should mention English is not my first language if any mistake show up.

TL;DR: I am struggling if I should quit a recently acquired job (less than a week) where I am helping to build the BI of an multinational company or go to work in a ML focused in a big local country.",12,2,False,self,,,,,

[Google](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/6033539515744256-data-scientist-engineering/):

&gt;Master's degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Statistics, Operations Research, Bioinformatics, Economics, Computational Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering)  

[Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/868431):

&gt; Ph.D. in Computer Science, Statistics, Physics, or related quantitative field

[eBay](https://jobs.ebayinc.com/job/-/-/403/11381186):

&gt;Strong quantitative background with Bachelors degree in Computer Science, Math, Economics, Physics, Engineering, or related.  

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/750795/data-scientist):

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/205743826659289/):

&gt; BA/BS in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering, Statistics or other technical field.

So why do people here automatically say get a degree in CS or statistics for a data science role?

Machine learning and Deep learning courses are available but they dont appear to have a strong theory emphasis. Looks like math is taught in an ad hoc manner. I want to go beyond the scope of my curriculum.

Id like to be able to understand the average machine learning paper without spending hours on the side trying to learn maths Ive never seen before. However, I do not need to be able to understand bleeding-edge machine learning papers. 

My current road math:

**Discrete math (propositional/first order logic, relations, mod arithmetic, intro graph theory, mathematical induction and proofs)

**Multivariate calculus

**Applied linear algebra (perpendicular frames, 3D matrices, SVD analysis, matrix diagonalization, Spectal Theorem, Root-Mean Square approximation, etc.)

**Intro to probability (probability spaces, random variables, stochastic independence, special distributions, limit theorems, etc.)

**Statistical theory (estimation, best tests, Rao-Cramer inequality, multivariate normal distribution, nonparametric methods, etc.)

Would this suffice as a good enough mathematical base (i.e. be able to derive new needed math quickly)?

If not, what should I add / topics I need to formally cover?

Real analysis?
More Stat courses?

I did the compulsory maths and statistics classes (intermediate level) and I found an internship at a small firm that was hiring data scientists.

They hired 5 interns and the other 3 interns came from computer science backgrounds and immediately, I felt a little left out along with the other intern who did the same course as me. They had used R and Python before so SQL was the only gap they needed to cover. I had no knowledge of any language or querying so they gave me a self learn course to work on. In the meanwhile, the other interns were already doing proper work such as querying for clients and basic arules mining. The manager moved me across to another team where I was doing stuff like cleaning excel spreadsheets and helping with customer service. This was already a red flag for me but I continued. This went on for a month or so before I asked if I could do something related to SQL. The manager agreed and gave me a task that was related more towards DS and gave me instructions on how to go about it.

Long story short, skip to a week later, the manager said that my query was not what he asked for and was visibly pissed off. I felt really bad because I felt i had screwed my chance up by not asking additional questions about the task so I seemed more dependable. A couple of weeks later, my manager terminated my contract along saying I failed to listen to clear instructions and told me to leave the office as soon as possible. 

Skip forward another year, ive done another successful internship at finance start up which was really boring to say the least. I applied for a larger firm as they were hiring DS interns and I got the position which was really surprising. The interviewer mentioned that I was literally the only one who wasnt doing actuarial sciences, pure mathematics or computer science so I have no idea how I got the position. 

Ive been in this company for over 3 months now (got offered a part time after my 3 month contract) and ive learned a tremendous amount, not only in technical work (worked with Python, R, SQL and Scala) but also as a competent employee. My current company recently went public on the NYSE and received about 50m in funding from investors so the team is now looking for more data scientists who arent as senior as the other two im currently working with. 

I saw a few of the resumes and all the applicants seem so much better than I am, graduating from Ivy Leagues with honors in actuarial sciences/maths and previously holding positions in FANG companies as interns. This made me really anxious because I feel like they will outperform me in every aspect (even though Im still a senior at a relatively good university). I constantly get little anxiety attacks and feel down all the time. There was this one applicant who graduated from MIT and my manager spoke really fondly of her to another manager. 

I scrolled through a bunch of linkedin profiles of data scientists and i found that about 80% had some discipline related in a super technical degree such as pure maths etc. 

Can someone shed some light on what I should be doing? I really enjoy the fluid work of DS.

Also, can my previous manager talk badly about me to my colleagues? 


He is well connected in the data science community and is connected to most of the seniors in my company on Linkedin who regularly go to Big Data conferences etc.

The challenge problem is worded in a way that's pretty obvious that they are looking for something along machine learning, though they didn't use the word explicitly.

I spent the last few months learning as much as I could (I have no CS, statistics or math background) about data science, machine learning and text analytics. I came to the conclusion that, machine learning is not cutout for this kind of task without tremendous investment, in time, money and quality training data. I submitted my solution for the challenge using other non-AI techniques, but I'm still wondering whether my assessment of the challenge was ""in the ballpark"".

Basically, the data provided to us for the challenge consists of about 2000 trouble tickets from one particular support department, including all the notes and some slightly higher quality summaries written by the technician at the end of support. 

Without any machine learning, I was able to tell simply by analyzing the n-gram frequency what the most common type of tickets are. Then based on those summary texts and the keywords I categorized the tickets. I suppose if there are enough data (maybe in the tens of thousands), a ML model can be trained to do the same categorization with some 90+% accuracy, but since the data set is way too small I didn't even attempt it (but perhaps 2000 is not too small?). 

Either way, the real challenge comes after the initial broad classification. The biggest category (including false positives) from my own method contain just over 100 tickets, and under that category, there are a lot of different types of issues (we have a very complex environment). That's not gonna be enough data for any sort of machine learning to properly classify further. Besides, how do we know what are all the types of issues to even create the classes?

So I again used n-gram frequency to find common topics and again used keywords to classify. Was I able to come up with suggestions on how to reduce tickets? Yes, lots of them. Did I use any cutting edge, buzzword technologies? No. Maybe the management is looking for the cutting edge buzzword solutions to help sell out, but I don't think ML, DL, NB or whatever is going to help us here. I have also tried topic modeling, but the output from that was 60% to 80% garbage. I think I know why - trouble tickets note are extremely abstract, with key information hidden in just a couple of words, versus more natural conversations between people which are less abstract (people don't typically talk like dorks).

Of course I want to win the challenge, but my bigger concern is whether the company is heading the right direction - it seems like people are hyped about ML and just want to ride the hype train as far as they can before it runs out of fuel. I believe ML is a wonderful tool on its own, but it's not snake oil. I don't think it can be very helpful in extracting answers to ""why"" from text data of moderate size.

I'm pretty excited/nervous about tomorrow and I wanted to reach out to people with more experienced than me just to clear up some questions of mine, which I have listed below:

1. **Should I be negotiating the first salary offer companies give me?** 
   1. I'm asking this because my mentor at a Data Analytics program I'm currently attending told me to do always decline the first offer a company gives me but I'm afraid of actually following through with this because I have minimum work experience and am nervous companies won't even give a counter offer.
2. **Should I expect to do any live coding during my interviews for Data Analyst / Business Intelligence positions and if so what will the difficulty be?**
   1. I feel pretty confident with my Python and SQL abilities. However, I recently watched some YouTube interview videos from Google Python Developers and don't feel so confident anymore lol and I'm scared of drawing a blank during a live coding question.
3. **Should I set a goal metric for my starting salary?**
   1. I know this is kinda of a stupid question but I just don't want to end up regretting taking an low ball offer during my first few interviews. I live in Tampa, Florida and the average Data Analyst salary here is $62,000. Currently, I have my goal starting salary at $60,000 is this realistic?",3,3,False,self,,,,,

The challenge is to predict the expenses in transactions, receipts and cards that users will have next year. For this, they provide me as input data the expenses of each client of a whole year of the three fields described above and also the sociodemographic data of each user as country of residence, age, gender, etc. I'll leave you a sample of both tables. The problem with which I find myself is that in the sociodemographic data I do not have coherent data. In the country of residence, or gendre or Age for example I have this: 

Domain of Sexo      -------&gt; \['R', 'S'\]  
Domain of Edad      -------&gt;  \[Min : 10, Max : 118\]  
Domain of PAIS\_RESI -------&gt;\['BH', '+V', '#B', 'GB', 'CV', ')Z', 'EH', 'TS', 'W)', 'RB', 'HB', 'QY', 'KC', 'DM', 'DE', 'AK', 'HD', 'KJ', 'ZH', 'EL', 'JG', 'EV', '#C', 'BT', 'EB', 'UJ', 'HJ', 'TJ', 'QJ', 'JC', 'VZ', 'GU', 'TW', 'WL', 'KB', 'DV', 'SW', 'PU', 'GL', 'GP', '+#', 'RW'\]

 I have many more columns and the degree of inconsistency remains the same. I don't know how to clean the data in order to analyze the data. I will provide you an image of both tables.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](1frihse24uq21)

The meaning of the columns on the sociodemo table are:

ID ---&gt; client ID

SEXO ---&gt; gendre

PAIS\_RESI ---&gt; Country of residence code

PAIS\_NACI -----&gt; Country of birth code

nivestud ---&gt; educational level

idiomapr ---&gt; preferred language

   and so on... 

 The meaning of columns on the transcational table are:

   ID -----&gt; client ID

  mes ----&gt; month

  transfers -----&gt; transfers in a month

  recibos ----&gt; receipts

  tarjeta -----&gt; cards.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to predict and get a table like the transactional.csv for the next year. The problem is that I do not have coherent data or a set of training and testing. How do you recommend me to approach this issue?

I'm using pandas, pyton, sklearn, openrefine.

Even with clustering i cannot agroup the set of values.

The purpose of this project is to allow people prototype Deep Neural networks very very quickly and with writing 0 lines of code. For now you can only build regular dense networks. It also allows for data visualization using Tableau and you can also save models in json format. Please note this is very much work in progress and was made by 4 college students in 24 hours, so there will be bugs. We decided to make this open source, so you are more than welcome to contribute, I have posted a couple issues on github so feel free to contribute.

MY SITUATION  
Male mid 20's, thinking of living with my Japanese girlfriend in Tokyo after I wrap up university. Nearly done a bachelor of economics and soon starting a 2 year master of stats here in Australia.  
Keen interest in data and using my communication skills to bridge the gap between business and tech to solve challenging problems, though I'm skeptical I could work like this in Japan.

  
I've got JLPT N2 and am comfortable *recognising* 1200 or so Kanji. Everyday conversation is no problem, outside of that I'm in trouble. My reading sucks outside of everyday conversation, so I'd need to improve that drastically + learn keigo and lots of vocabulary to work in Japanese (plus more perhaps?)  
I know there aren't many data related positions in english only, but the idea of working in Japanese makes me nervous. It's a huge time commitment learning that much Japanese; plus I couldn't stand working at any of the more traditional companies with rigid constraints and inefficiencies everywhere. Not to mention overtime at most of those companies.

Are decision driven by legal and licensing issues more than technical reasons?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/base78/opensource_vs_commercial_software_why_do_large/,MonthyPythonista,1554721330,"As per the subject: I am curious to see if any one can comment on what drove certain institutions or companies to choose commercial or opensource software. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are niches where a certain tool is still the best (e.g. Matlab for certain very specific applications, I am told) but also many fields where a number of different software could be used.

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious about what drives these decisions:

* the decision-maker(s) being more familiar with one tool vs the other?
* quality of the documentation and support?  Time is money, lots of opensource is poorly documented and finding an answer may be very time-consuming and frustrating
* stability of the API? E.g. Python's pandas API keeps changing with functions and arguments being deprecated all the time
* the legal and compliance department being ""scared"" of opensource? Maybe they think they can sue Microsoft or Mathworks (good luck with that!) while they cannot sue the R foundation?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I was surprised to learn that the Bank of England uses Matlab for a lot of its financial and economic modelling (google Bank of England Matlab - lots of examples on that; one such example is [this](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/company/events/conferences/matlab-computational-finance-conference/2014/proceedings/bank-of-englands-forecasting-platform-compass-maps-ease-suite-of-models.pdf)). Back when they started doing this, Python was probably not a feasible option, but R should have been; in fact, statistical, time-series and econometric analyses are R's bread and butter, more than Matlab, and I would expect economists and statisticians to be traditionally more familiar with R.",27,3,False,self,,,,,

my use case is the following: I run about 60 websockets in parallel that record cryptocurrency prices (so time-series data). Currently, I'm writing the data into a mongodb that is hosted on a Google Cloud VM. However, the database has grown to 0.6 GB after only one week. I'm pretty new to such questions, but I have a feeling that this is not a viable long-term solution. I will never need all of the data at once, but I need all of the data in order to query by date / currency.

Currently, I'm thinking of either switching to another kind of database, or exporting the database once per week / month / whatever to CSV and wiping out.

Im in the process of likely accepting an offer from a top 10 PhD in political science with a methodological reputation for being more quantitatively-oriented (specifically, in applied statistics and machine learning). My primary aim is to obtain a tenure-track position after I complete the program; however, as a (slightly) older than average applicant and one with strong geographical preferences in academic placement, I understand that the academic route may not work out, especially in light of the dwindling prospects in that field. Additionally, the methodological framework I intend to use to answer my research questions is largely computational in nature (machine learning, NLP). For that reason, its my intention to put myself out on the academic job market for one year, and turn to private sector/industry options should that job market experience prove unsuccessful. 

I am currently a research analyst at an economic consulting group. Although my undergraduate background isnt incredibly quantitative, I have taught myself to use R, SPSS, and Excel in my position regularly. I am also learning more about R, Python, and SQL through online courses (Coursera, EdX, Udemy, etc.). After researching about opportunities in data science for social science PhDs, I would like to use the PhD program as a catalyst for a potential career, should my academic prospects look dim  if thats possible. I believe that the program I will likely choose offers some clear opportunities to transition into this field by offering masters in statistics and/or computer science en route to the PhD; however, being able to pursue those opportunities is not guaranteed. Moreover, some recent graduate students in this program have been placed in DS positions at organizations like Facebook and other tech firms. 

For people in this forum who have transitioned from a social science graduate program into data science, Im wondering what courses or next steps I should look into at this point, as I would start the program this autumn, to begin preparing for a career in data science. Is a masters in statistics/computer science necessary for entry (if so, which one should I pursue)? What courses would you suggest I take to signal an interest to employers? Alternatively, do online courses through Coursera, EdX suffice to make that signal? What practical experiences would you suggest to help make the transition (internships, posting codes on github, etc.)? If you yourself pursued a DS internship during your PhD, did you do so earlier in the program, or later on? Conversely, do you believe making the transition from a social science PhD program to data science is really not that feasible, given my educational circumstances/background? 

If anyone could provide insight into any of these questions or concerns, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!",0,1,False,self,,,,,

In addition, any one customer signature should have a gap in time between the predictor variables and the target variable.

The way I understand this statement and his subsequent explanation is that, for example, if you are predicting a behavior for the next year your target behavior should only be collected from a year prior AND (this is where my confusion comes in) your input variables should be 2-3 years back with a gap of a year that corresponds to the year your target behavior takes place in. 

In other words I think what is being suggested here is if you want to predict something that will happen through 2020, your target will consist of behaviors from 2018-2019 and your input variables will consist of variables from 2015-2017.

Basically, there are data science jobs that rely very heavily on the software side of things; they may have a bit of data wrangling thrown in, and perhaps even some light modeling, but the focus is definitively on software and programming. It's not surprising that people with backgrounds in computer science and software engineering tend to land these jobs. But then there are other data science jobs that are, in a sense, more traditional: They require less software development skills, but much more statistical/mathematical skills. People with backgrounds in statistics, mathematics, and research sciences tend to land these types of jobs.

Despite having the same title, these two jobs do pretty different things, and draw on different skill sets.

Im a recent Business Information Systems graduate, and Im just simply exhausted of being unhappy with what I do everyday when I go to work. 

College was rough time for me in a lot of different ways, but the one thing I enjoyed more than anything was taking data and analytics related courses. Using programs such as Watson Analytics and ArcGIS and learning about data and programming languages like Python was the most satisfying experience Ive ever had. 

With that in mind, Ive been doing so much research and Redditing and googling about how to get into the field. Some say its always required to have the knowledge of a math based degree like CS, others have found success with online boot camps. And yet Ive read negative comments about both paths. I understand certain things have worked for certain people, but Im not sure what would be the correct path for me. A Business Information Systems graduate that is diversely knowledgeable regarding business processes and technical systems, but with short and passionate yet admittedly limited experience with data. 

Im getting desperate to end my current job to start a mission to start doing something I want to do, and Im wondering if you guys have any advice for me to begin? Im ready to sign up for Rmotrs data science course, but Im nervous to find out if NYC Data Science Academys summer program would be more worthwhile despite the cost(if I were to even get accepted).

I also took extra courses in Computer Science, Finance and Marketing, have a high level of proficiency in R, SQL and Excel and can use Python to an advanced level (I do not use python in my day job but if someone told me to make a neural network and run it on docker I could figure it out using the web and my base of knowledge).

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently had yet another interview for a data scientist position, after working at this data analyst job for about 1 year. The reason I'm looking around is because I see so many big pay packages and honestly I'm very hard working, determined and I want to save up as much as possible so I can free myself up to travel in my late 20s.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also notable that I live in eastern Australia (market may be a bit different where you are) data science is big here too but perhaps a bit less developed and less tech companies obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I was asked what I want to make by this consultancy company (I make 70k base right now, and I said I'd like to make 80k-90k base) and was basically told that was too high. Instead they said they will make me an incentive and if the company which they consult with wants to keep me around after 6 months they will increase my wage.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have the offer or the numbers yet, but I'm wondering if this seems worth it? It would be a data science gig doing actual data science in R, however if I get a 70k offer for this job I feel like I would be taking a considerable amount of risk just by swapping jobs and taking a chance with a new employer. Personally I feel I'm worth more but obviously I need to listen to the market. Anyways I'm just trying to think if I should take the offer now and get the data science title and experience to move on to bigger and better things or keep applying for jobs and find someone whos willing to meet my salary expectations.

I'm trying to learn more about how other data teams share results / analyses. It seems like, after doing the initial local R&amp;D in e.g. Jupyter, folks either:

a. Send the notebook to someone as a sort of report (e.g. export as .html). This may have some nice visualisations and Markdown to make it more consumable for folks who aren't data scientists, but isn't intended to be run or tweaked by them
b. The code from notebook gets turned into production model, deployed as HTTP endpoint (or on a scheduled batch workflow) using myriad of open source options, and basically turned into a piece of core infrastructure
c. Results get written to a database and visualised using something like Looker or Tableau

I'm curious as to whether anyone has had a genuine need to share their analyses as more interactive, user-friendly, and shareable notebooks or ""applications"" (as an extension of option ""a"")? Have you ever needed to serve your end analyses in a format which non-technical people can tweak with config or run with their own input data. If so, how did you go about this? 

The reason I ask is that I'm considering hacking up something to solve this use-case, and I'm really interested to see if it's a widespread problem, or something that's basically solved by the current set of tools.

Not sure if there has been a similar discussion before but I'm interested in this sub's opinion of things that I call 'data analytics ""lite""'. By that, I specifically mean visually based tools which do not involve real code.

A bit about me: I work in a company that uses Alteryx and Tableau to do the majority of their data analysis. In the past few months, I've realised that there is so much more scope out there for data analysis and data analytics beyond Alteryx and Tableau; namely, things like machine learning, statistical modelling using R, and using languages like Python to do... stuff (not sure exactly what it can do but I've only heard good things).

Recently, when I tried to transition into a more ""technical"" data analytics role that uses Python, R, and SQL, I've been shooed away because of an apparent skill gap. I've got this impression that people think that because I don't actually code at the moment for work, because I use 'drag-and-drop' tools like Tableau/Alteryx, that I don't have the skills to do the ""real"" stuff.

It frustrates me because I learned coding at university and took to it like a fish to water. Moreover, it's not as if I've been sitting around doing nothing - I work with data everyday, it's just usually in csv/Excel/txt format so I use Alteryx instead of SQL, and I don't visualise using ggplot2, but I chuck it into Tableau.

It's just unfortunate I suppose that the line of work I got into after uni is about business-facing analytics and with a heavy emphasis on explanation to stakeholders. After all, what's easier to explain to a non-technical person, a pretty Alteryx workflow that neatly splits out and joins the data, or 100 lines of SQL with SELECT this and INNER JOIN that?

I suppose what I want to get out of posting this is - what the role is of these drag-and-drop tools in organisations that do data analytics, whether learning and honing skill in these is even useful, and how those of us who are using these can transition into the seemingly greener pasture of actual data analytics coding/programming.

I ultimately ended up back in the same industry (insurance), but now as a Data Scientist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent most of my time learning domain knowledge. Insurance industry uses primarily GLMS, which is kind of glossed over in books/courses since it's mostly an extension of a linear model. Spent a lot of time learning the best way to model insurance data using GLMs. The goal of an insurance pricing model is to segment risks properly, so Gini Index is usually the best metric. It also needs to be a multiplicative closed formula result. So we can compare relativity between categorical variables and price insurance accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I start to get comfortable with a model, we move on to a more complex model, such as modeling by peril. Management doesn't quite understand how GLMs and is making some incorrect assumptions. For instance, they believe a by Peril model should be simple as adding up the perils together, which is not the case. But that's what they want to do, so I have to push through with it. I barely got the first model to a point where I'm comfortable putting my name on it and now I'm creating 6 models with a similar time constraint.

We also have modeling software where you upload an SQL query, select your target, weight, and explanatory variables, and it runs iterations to create a model. It then has suggestions to the model and you can rerun everything. I've been using this since the manager is comfortable with it, but I have little to no knowledge what the model is doing in the background. It gives summaries, variable significance, and ""model adjustments"" made to adjust coefficients. Management seems to take the model at face value: if it says a variable is important, we should include that in modeling. Without trying to understand the underlying reason it's important. There are also times where the data says a variable is very poor performing, but management wants to include it anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

So out of 6 months here, I'm not really proud of any of the models I've created. Management is happy with the models I've made, but kind of have this sinking feeling in my stomach because I'm not confident in what the software has done. I'm guessing it will get better over time. Having a meeting next week to discuss other areas I can help out in, which will be a nice change of pace. But I also have the desire to dig deeper into my first models, move them entirely into R, and improve them.",24,12,False,self,,,,,

For data analysis, I generally write two scripts: one for scraping data and putting it into a decent format, then another for analyzing the data and printing it to a graph or doing some other analysis.

For example, the directory structure I used in a recent project where I scraped currency exchange rate data over time, wrote it to a file, then ran that file through a script that uses panda and matplotlib to output a graph (then save it).

\+DataProjects

\--- + ExchangeRates

\------  + GetExchangeRates.py

\------  + writeToGraph.py

\------  + USDRUB\_exchangeRates.csv

\------  + USDEUR\_exchangeRates.csv

Is the data publicly available? I'm looking for some ideas for a data science project I can complete myself, and more generally looking for some inspiration for what I might be able to do in a future career.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: Last year I completed my PhD in mechanical engineering. In grad school I received a couple of fellowships that allowed me to pursue research which I was interested in -- solar use in developing communities. My research shifted from technical to social science and econometrics since the barriers to solar use are largely social, political, and economic. Since I pursued research I was interested in rather than research that would get me a job, I've ended up in a weird place; I lack the technical focus required for a traditional mechanical engineering post-doc, and I am having a hard time landing an international development role because they are looking for economists and social/political scientists (plus it is a difficult field to get into).

&amp;#x200B;

Currently: I'm working to transition into a data science role, where I would ideally be applying some of my engineering or development domain knowledge. I'm starting the capstone course of the EdX/HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate, which primarily consists of an independent data science project. I know that there is little value put on DS certificates in this sub, but since it culminates in a project that I can include on my resume, I thought it would be worth it. I would like a project that is somewhat related to mechanical engineering or international development, able to complete in \~40 hrs of effort, demonstrates a range of DS skills (e.g. dataset isn't prefect and requires some cleaning), and likely to result in something interesting to discuss in an interview. I've been browsing through the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets),  [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/), but nothing has ""spoke to me."" I'm interested in this [dataset/challenge on predicting which water pumps are faulty](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), but I feel like it might be too basic, especially since there is a DataCamp course focused on this data.

I know you've seen the github repos of Machine Learning scripts coloring images with some pretty impressive results but with the obvious drawback where in face of images not similar to training set it starts to dip in expected realistic output.

Inspired by this I decided to first see if I could figure out how these models did that starting with what I knew with Python and that's the PIL library that allow me to open and edit an image.

I slowly found out that it's not that hard to edit colors in an image so came the harder part of making that capability into an easy to use feature and so from that came my webapp Color Editor

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSpVxtOC-00

This allowed me to color images and edit images using color like for example here coloring a black and white image

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUHMaz7bupg

Now here's the interesting part, if you can train a model that can similar to how the coloring models work but this time using object segmentation that would send the segments to Color Editor with an additional color code of how to edit the image in terms of Color it would essentially be a different way to build a coloring model, with the added bonus it would learn to get more fine grained at picking out what an object looks like in grayscale and it's outline then send directions on how to color it to the application.

That's my final vision of the project and the added thing is the project is also open source and available to use online

&amp;#x200B;

* I am interested in getting better with Python, and in fact have planned to do so over the course of my career. This could be a good motivator.
* I am a full-time student taking 16 credits with interests and a life outside of school. Time is tight and the deadline is soon.
* The initiative will likely go a long way in the eyes of the recruiter.
* I will still be much, much better with R by that time. How far will a few weeks of possibly grinding out Python really go?
* I am really eager about getting my foot in the door of the profession.
* The particular industry of the company I am ambivalent to, and there is no guarantee for a position (or even advancement in the interview process).
* There seems to be a plethora of free or cheap online tutorials and MOOCs that I could potentially finish in the time allotted.
* At the moment, there doesn't seem to be a shortage of jobs in my area, including positions that mention R.

&amp;#x200B;

I've already put in so much work up front into necessary skills outside of my coursework, including learning R and SQL--is this entry-level position worth a grueling few more weeks? (Cont., why do ""entry-level"" positions seem so demanding in general?) Do I just need to suck it up? Is it possible to go from a basic understanding of Python to proficiency with data analysis in just a few weeks when you already are comfortable with R? If so, what materials might one look into? I will keep looking for other positions; is this one worth putting in the extra effort? Would that time be better spent looking for other positions?

I 've self-taught a lot of coding and am proficient in Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and currently learning Keras/Tensorflow). No research or internship experience. A few small projects.

I've been admitted to the Master of Applied Statistics program at UCLA as well as data science programs at Columbia and Brown. I'm having a really hard time deciding between schools. My two top factors for consideration are salary and how quickly I'll be able to finish the program and get a job. 

UCLA: about $30k total tuition. 2 year program.

Brown: $67k total tuition. 1 year (2 semester program). Benefit: internship/Capstone project.

Columbia: $57k total tuition. 1 year. Benefit: Flexible choice of graduate elective courses. Capstone project. Older/ more recognized data science program.

According to Brown's data science career outcomes webpage, there's a 100% (n = 24) employment rate for graduates of their program. Many of these graduates work at top financial and tech companies. Columbia doesn't publish specific numbers but also lists many high-paying companies that their graduates go on to work at. UCLA doesn't publish any data about their graduates at all.

The first thing you need to know about me is that I am queer (trans/nonbinary.) This will be important shortly.

I have kind of had data science as a long-term goal for a while now because I don't know what else to do with my math degree. And then yesterday I read this.

https://reallifemag.com/counting-the-countless/

If you don't want to page through the whole thing, its thesis is that what I thought was my desired line of work is actually incredibly harmful to people like me, by way of reinforcing the gender binary and other hegemonic constructs - at such a fundamental level that even getting into DS with the intent of fixing its algorithmic bias problems and whatnot is still going to get you subsumed by a system that's way bigger than you can ever be.

If you're not queer or trans then you may not quite get just how earth-shattering this conclusion is to me. I am not exaggerating when I say discovering my gender identity saved my life. If it ever went away I would go with it. It is absolutely non-negotiable.

The piece lays out some thoughts for people in my position can do instead, but from what I can tell they're all basically ""dismantle capitalism"" (I'm not as well-read on theory as I would like to be, so a lot of it is gibberish to me) and though I would love to do that I can't accomplish very much along those lines before I graduate.

The bottom line is I would rather live in poverty for the rest of my life than have a high-paying DS job and lose sleep every night over the knowledge that I'm contributing to the slow death of people who could have been my friends.

Is there a third way? I'm 21. I live in the middle of nowhere as far as tech is concerned and I can't relocate. I'll have an MS in mathematics next year (or I'll be dead.) I'm not sure I have what it takes to do a PhD. I can code well enough but I feel as though getting an SE job wouldn't really be any better; it would just be feeding into the same system. I feel like I'm fast approaching the end of my rope. I don't know what to do.

I feel like I messed up six years ago when I got into college by way of being too young to have any goddamn idea what I want to do for myself.

(Before you say it, yes, I almost certainly have depression or some kind of malaise like that. But I don't see how seeing a therapist or taking meds or doing anything traditional like that is going to change the reality of the situation. It might make it easier for me to ignore or rationalize away my problems, but it can't solve them because they're pretty close to unsolvable.)

As many of you have seen today on reddit, we have witnessed the first pictures of a black hole ever.

I noticed that constructing this black hole image was due in part by data/big data with petabytes of data being involved. I wanted to also ask the community of your thoughts about the role of data science and its power to continue marking human achievements such as this moving forward.

It seemed that the image was planned for 2017 but got delayed till this year and what called out to me was the use of using satellites around the globe to gather data.

1) Will an online masters degree in data science make me as credible and employable as a traditional masters degree in data science? 

2) One of the features I think most about traditional programs is being able to collaborate in person with my fellow students and professors and work on side projects and really immerse myself in the program. Is this feature completely missing in online programs or will there still be a feeing of collab and innovation?

3) Does anyone know if Syracuse University considered a good school for data analysis/sci? (Its ranked in the 60s nationally I believe but I havent read about any groundbreaking projects coming out of its CS department.)

tl;dr at bottom
My dillema: 
I dont know how to move forward with the experience that I have. In fact, I dont know which routes I can take yet as Im not sure whether the experience I have is enough to move forward. Very confused!
So Im pretty stumped at the moment as to where I can go with the experience I have.

Experience I have: 
6 months of SQL(stored procedures and created one custom table)
2 years of VBA (automated a few processes as well as helping another department when they called upon me for help)
3 years of Excel (definitely know my way around formulas and would be confident creating a complicated spreadsheet for anybody, although have never had experience creating graphs.....ever)
Also, Ive used Cognos Cubes in my current role to extract data but these are simple pivot tables so I dont see a point in naming this out on my resume.

The roles that I have held have always been the types where the tasks and responsibilities are repetitive and have never allowed me to call upon my creativity (tbh, I'm not sure if I have any creativity at this point). They have been roles where, if you wrote down a step by step guide, anybody could do the job. This is not to say that the jobs were super easy. The jobs were repetitive but one wrong step, and you've effed up the whole file (you may not even notice you messes up).

The issue is, I feel, that I do not have soft skills that I see in many job specifications that I feel I could go for.
For example, most of the roles require an individual to have experience in pulling insights from data. I have never been in a role where I have helped in this type of way, so this excludes me from many roles.
Additionally, all of the more technical roles require more specialisation in the technical competencies mentioned in the job posting.
For example, SQL Developer roles require specialised SQL experience.

So, what now??
The experience I have puts me in a position where I am unable to do much as I don't any sort of significant experience. I have looked into learning Python, but it is such a diverse language with so many uses that I'm not sure where to start, I mean for one I need to pick a path first.
The goal is, in 5 years, to be able to offer my services to companies as a contractor and become established as a contractor in a field that I choose to go down.
I have looked into roles such as DBA and BI Developer but do not want to pick these two path before I know every possible path I can take from here.

What do you guys think? Are my options wide open because I'm still at an early stage of my career?
For those of you who have been in similar positions, where have you gone on from there?
Are there any recommended websites, blogs, reddit posts you think would help clearing up my head with this at the moment?

Thanks for reading the long post!

TL;DR: 3 years excel, 2 years vba and 6 months sql  experience. With the lack on of insight analysis experience what routes can I take from here??

I am working on a project that requires me to create a classifier and a regressor using a highly unbalanced targets! 

Essentially I need to assess the impact of two continuous features on a binary target. So initially thought random forest, feature importance and shap for some further analysis and heres what happens...:

Classifier: around 5% positive class and 95 negative! Tried using balanced random forest, results were garbage!! Tried sampling(under and over) but then I was not sure how accurate would shap analysis be?

I thought I will reverse the problem and use one of the continuous variables as a target and the binary variable with some other control variables as input. And once again a similar problem occurs. The MSE and MAE seem kind of low but that is because all the values are heavily skewed towards the lower end of the scale and they are quite well estimates, however the values towards the tail end and grossly underestimated! (E.g the scale is between 0and 1 and at around .6 the MAE increases from .12 to .37 and by .9 it MAE is around .6!) . I tried weighted RF and that doesnt help a great deal (although I am not sure what is the best strategy in setting the weights)

As a person who's first exposure to data science was on Coursera, it has a somewhat special place in my heart. The Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization was a great way to get myself introduced into the world of data science, and the further I got through the course, the more I felt like I wanted to do this for a living. And I managed to pull that off! The only downside is that R is my specialty, and I currently work in a predominately Python atmosphere. So I thought what better way to spruce up my Python techniques than taking some more Coursera courses, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, to my dismay, the University of Michigan's Data Science with Python classes are a disorganized mess. The professors clearly haven't updated things in the course for years. The videos had errors galore, there were errors in the assignments that we were given, and the notes were filled with outdated code that has been done away with since Python has been updated. It's one thing to encourage users to hop on the discussion forum for better learning and discussion between peers and professionals, but I found the discussion forum was just filled with ways to get around the errors that the instructors left behind for the user to deal with. While these were not meant to be courses in Python debugging, they turned out to be that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to make a long story short, if you're interested in learning Python for data science, I can not recommend these courses. This is not to say that everything on Coursera is garbage. As I mentioned, the Johns Hopkins classes arguably got me the job I have today. But if you're jumping in to these ideas for the first time, the University of Michigan does not make data science a fun subject to learn. Instead, they turn it into a specialization of jumping through hoops to get a certification, and needless to say, that's not how people learn.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy).

I know that a lot of big players are investing right now into partnerships with various universities and/or quantum companies, so that they can have teams of engineers and data scientists ready to play with quantum computers when they become available (and also I guess so that they can know what to actually do with it).

So my (very open) questions are: do you care about this new tool soon to be in the box ? Do you try to learn about it in technical details ? Is there already some kind of calculation / algorithms you'd dream to apply on a quantum machine ? Do you think that kind of questions are too far ahead ?

The way I see it is that QC available as server bays or in the cloud is still some years ahead but not too far either. IBM has actually had for some years an [online quantum simulator](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/editor) to create some traction around the subject, not sure it's been very succesful so far. Microsoft has also given some press around Q#. So it can be rather advantageous to at least know some of the physics behind QC and maybe try to think about new ways to apply it, so that when it is out, I have a leg up. Also mid-term this screams of opportunities to start a new company, because the natural inertia of the entire system has only ever been reversed by two things: time for old timers to get out, and money for costly product or overpaid consultants.

PS: Before you ask I'm not shilling for IBM, I'm actually an embedded engineer at a startup. So I'm probably far removed from any professional quantum computing for the next 30 years at least (just in time for retirement).

PPS: Sorry that's probably not the best place to ask this question, but you can keep your answers data-science related if you wish, I'm sure there is plenty to say on that one subject already :)",14,0,False,self,,,,,

The process was as follows:

1. Took written take-home interview that mainly asked questions about SQL queries and some pretty basic statistic concepts. 
2. I then received an invitation for a Skype interview which I accepted and completed. This was more of a behavioral interview. Very few technical questions asked, mainly questions about how I overcame obstacles, etc.
3. I got the call that I was selected as a DS intern for the summer. I gladly accepted it and I am really pumped to have my foot in the door since it seems like data science work is mainly reserved for people with at least a Bachelors but usually a Masters.

&amp;#x200B;

So for past couple of weeks I am pretty much confused about learning data science. My background is; a media grad in advertising and have been doing Digital marketing for more than 7 years now. My expertise include Facebook ads, Google ads &amp; social media but not just media buying but actually data driven performance marketing. I am also familiar with coding, just familiar though like syntax etc. I cannot write code but again can understand it a little by looking at it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am good with branding stuff too as I have studied advertising and it sort of comes naturally outta me. I used to be a graphic designer 10 years back so yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

So now back to my actual question, will learning Data science going to help me excel in my career? Will it be really hard for me to learn Python &amp; R? Oh just by the way, I kinda hate statistics. I mean the equations &amp; etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I be focusing more on something else? Like be good with branding by experimenting or to do more in-depth courses for digital and performance marketing? Will data science help me in advertising sector too?

If you're considering a bootcamp, and it's partnered with a university, check if it's hosted by Trilogy before enrolling. If it is, stay away.

Hi all,

Just wanted to write a quick cautionary post for anyone considering bootcamps as a potential route for getting into the data science field.

Im a recent graduate with an MS in applied math in December looking for positions as a data analyst / scientist. Unfortunately, I wasn't having much luck getting responses. I didn't have any previous internships, as my original plan was to get a PhD, and only ended up getting the MS due to major problems with the school that cropped up halfway through my third semester (a whole other story, though). I had seen a few recommendations for bootcamps on here as a way to break into the field for people with no experience. I noticed that my undergraduate school ""hosted"" one, and figured that it might be a good way to fill in the gap between me graduating and me finally getting a job, and at the very least learn how to implement all of the theory that I had been learning over my degrees. I had some experience in Python from undergrad and from going through some Kaggle tutorials, but figured there had to be something else I was missing since I wasn't getting any responses.

After enrolling and paying (way too much) money, I got to the class and learned pretty quickly that the bootcamp wasn't hosted by the university, but rather some company called Trilogy Education Services. Already I felt uneasy about continuing, but figured since I already paid I should stick with it. As the class continued, however, I quickly realized that I had essentially been swindled.

Enrollment: When I submitted my email / cell number for an ""I'm interested, tell me more"" link, I started to get daily calls from some employee of Trilogy who I thought was working for the university they were partnered with. Looking back, they were definitely trying to bait me into signing up for the class as soon as possible. There was an entrance exam, meant to screen people out, which was an absolute joke and that I wouldn't be surprised if no one actually does get screened. Some of the golden lines were ""we only have one spot left, and there's a few people I'm talking to that are considering it"" and ""I can't tell you which companies we have at the career days, like if I told you it was &lt;massive company with ties to my city&gt; and they weren't there, you'd be disappointed, but if you knew which companies we were partnered with, you'd be excited"" (these exact lines were also told to my classmates, too!). Red flags were going off at this point for me, but I was scared about having a gap on my resume where I wasn't doing anything, so I ended up taking the bait. Once I finally to the class, after paying, I learned that it was Trilogy hosting the class, and not the university.

Curriculum: All over the place. It's obvious that they come from a webdev bootcamp background. So far it's been: 2 weeks of Excel / VBA, 6 weeks of Python (this should be the meat of the course, but everything we covered was so basic that I had already covered it between the single class I had taken and Kaggle tutorials), some relational database stuff (I hadn't even taken a class on this and I knew 90% of the stuff they taught just from spending a week or two on hackerrank SQL questions...), HTML / CSS website building (boiled down to copy and pasting lines of bootstrap code), a few random other topics like nonrelational databases (explained poorly, I still don't know when you'd use a relational vs nonrelational other than when you really want joins), some statistics / hypothesis testing (explained very incorrectly), and web scraping with beautifulsoup / splinter (surprisingly decent, though I knew BS beforehand). Next week we're going into JS, which why It feels like everything we're learning is solely for visualizing data, when I signed up for the bootcamp (and expressed to the recruiter person) that I was seeking to become a data scientist. We were told that it was a project based curriculum to help better our portfolio, but none of the projects we've done I'd feel comfortable pinning on my GitHub or listing on my resume.

Support staff: The instructor... is a nice guy, but god awful at teaching. Incredibly basic concepts that even I could talk about would be explained in the most convoluted way possible that would leave everyone confused. Every single time a student asks a question, he fails to understand the meat of what they're asking and starts going off on some long tangent talking about stuff that isn't relevant to what they asked. He also is horrible at keeping pace with the class, and we will very often fall behind to the point where some assignments simply aren't covered or are explained during extra hours that he tacks on before class. Additionally, I feel sometimes like he just doesnt know what hes talking about. I remember a specific time that the person sitting next to me asked him a pretty simple question (which should have been answered in the solutions to the assignment we were doing), and the instructor proceeded to go into a 10 minute tangent trying to figure out what to do, before I finally leaned over and answered her question in a sentence. I remember when we were discussing hypothesis testing that the instructor, in one day, attempted to: accept the null hypothesis, accept the alternative hypothesis, thought that a p-value of 0.5 was the usual threshold of significance (he said this multiple times, even after being corrected), and thought that we had a p-value of ~6.38 on one problem because he didn't understand what the e-05 at the end of the number meant (and seemed to still not get it after another student explained scientific notation to him).

The TAs don't do anything. We had one good one who stopped participating after a couple months due to schedule overload, and after he left I don't think a TA has talked to me or asked me how I was doing on the assignments more than one or two times since. Other classmates have the same complaints. Instead, all they do is sit in the back and talk loudly to each other while the instructor is attempting to teach. There's a ""student success manager"" in charge of some behind the scenes of the class that also doesn't seem to do anything. We have weekly reviews that are submitted of how we're feeling about the class, and after I finally submitted 10 or so poor - mediocre reviews she emailed me asking what she can do to help, and after giving a response of my grievances I was met with silence. Career services so far has been useless. All we've done halfway through the class is develop a brand statement (elevator speech) and submitted our resume for review (my comments boiled down to put the bootcamp at the top of the resume and take out any academic achievements I had like my published paper, which... why...) or given information documents with stuff that seems blatantly wrong (We were given a document of skill clusters for different jobs, and I may be wrong here, but I don't think Hadoop is the 3rd most important skill a data scientist should have).

Companies Trilogy is *actually* partnered with: The previous session of the bootcamp that was hosted at the same location had their career day during one of our classes, so I got to see what they had to offer. And... it was maybe 10 or so tiny companies / startups I had seen on linkedin during my job hunt, and nothing from large companies that I'd like to have connections at. &lt;massive company with ties to my city&gt; was definitely *not* there. One of my classmates even talked to one of them and their recruiter told him that they weren't even looking for entry-level people, and were there for senior managers, which is just absolutely hilarious.

Overall, the way I feel can be summed up as: I'm paying money for the company to use me as a partial TA. Half the time I'm in the class I'm helping answer questions of my classmates and explain things to them that I understood but went over their heads. I was told by the recruiter that I'd be a good fit and bring a lot to the class, but I didn't realize it would be in the form of free labor for them.

These grievances aren't just how I'm feeling either. I was thinking that I was the one person feeling this way about the class since I came in with an advanced background and thought ""maybe I was just at a level above what this is targeting,"" but after talking to some of my classmates who came in with no background in these topics (so what this bootcamp is targeting), they all feel the exact same way as me, except instead of feeling like they're wasting their time covering what they already know, they're wasting their time having everything explained to them poorly and then will need to go back and actually learn it on their own. Which, if that's the case for everyone, then why are we paying $10k a seat for an instructor and TAs to not be helpful?

If you're considering a bootcamp that's partnered with a university, and they seem to be partnered with a fair few, please check if the bootcamp is associated or hosted by Trilogy in any way. If it is, I would highly recommend against pursuing it. People in my situation (advanced degree, slight knowledge of what goes on in DS but no experience) would be far better off simply tackling some Kaggle problems and learning this on their own. People with absolutely no knowledge of what happens in DS won't develop proper skills here, unless the only thing you wanted to do was build web dashboards, which you could probably find some online resources covering exactly this for free. After spending a few months applying, I'm finally starting to get some responses for jobs, no thanks to this bootcamp. I'm not even sure if I should be listing it on my resume, to be quite frank, because I feel like the projects I've done on my own and my degree go a lot farther.

Hopefully someone in the same position I was in gets something from this post. Thanks for reading.",101,154,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently applying for master's programmes. One of my preferred choices demands a motivation letter with a maximum of 400 words. Since I'm not a native speaker, I'd love if somebody could take a look at it and give me some feedback! :)



&gt; Dear Sir or Madam,
&gt; 
&gt; my name is [name] and I have recently finished my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the [University]. I believe that the future lies in data and that is where I see my future as well. For this reason, I would like to submit my name to the [Master's programme] at the [University of Choice] (UoC).
&gt; 
&gt; During my time at the [University], the project-based curriculum enabled me to take the initiative and shape my studies, allowing me to put an early focus on data science. 
&gt; As the project manager of our bachelor's project [name of project] ([description]), I improved my abilities as a team player and leader, while also overseeing the implementation of a larger-scale machine learning model. 

&gt; Working autonomously, I was able to tackle a data science project in its entirety -  ranging from data retrieval to evaluation - as part of my bachelors thesis. My goal was to show the relationship between music and emotion in the context of a recommendation system, for which I got promising results on which I want to further iterate.

&gt; Overall, I spent two years with my universitys data science-related research group, [name of research group], ranking among the top 10% of that programme. 
&gt; 
&gt; With the desire to apply my knowledge to the real world, I am now working as a Data Analyst Intern at [company]. In a more business-oriented environment, I get to work with the Microsoft Azure cloud platform with the task to automate the retrieval and feature engineering of weather data. 
&gt; 
&gt; I now want to strengthen and focus my skill set, which I aim to do at the [UoC]. 
&gt; During my Data Science course, one of my supervisors ([name of supervisor]) directed me towards the [UoC], as he has also studied there. Ever since then, the strong emphasis on research as well as the interdisciplinary nature of the [UoC] attracted me. For the data science track in particular, I was drawn to the focused curriculum (in contrast to only being a data science programme by name) as well as to the project-led and customisable structure of the classes. 
&gt; 
&gt; I will be happy to provide any further information or documents if required. I look forward to your positive response. Thank you for your time and consideration.

In my latest weekend-project I have been using a Variational Autoencoder to build a feature-based face editor. The model is explained in my youtube video:

https://youtu.be/uszj2MOLY08

You can inspect the code at Github:

https://github.com/SteffenCzolbe/FeatureTransferApp

The feature editing is based on modifying the latent distribution of the VAE. After training of the VAE is completed, the latent space is mapped by encoding the training data once more. Latent space vectors of each feature are determined based on the labels of the training data. Then to edit an image, we can add a combination of feature vectors to its latent distribution, and then reconstruct it. The reconstruction creates an altered version of the original image, based on the featrures we added to the latent representation.

The model used is heavily inspired by the Bate-VAE used in this paper by google deepmind (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a902/26c41b79f8b06007609f39f82757073641e2.pdf). I made some adjustments to it to incorporate more recent advancements in neural network architecture, like using a Leaky ReLu activation function. The dataset used is celebA, which consist of 200.000 annotated images of celebrities. I aligned and cropped the images to a 64x64 resolution before training. The model is implememted in PyTorch, and PyGame has been used for the GUI. Training on my single consumer grade GPU took about 1:30h. The finished application, inducing the trained model, runs smoothly even without GPU support.

This project has been quite cool, playing with the result has been good fun. I got a lot of hands-on experience with VAEs. Creating a YouTube video explaining the project let me to learn much more about video editing and presentation techniques.

So a bit of background: I've just completed my undergraduate degree in CS and Math less than a year ago, and am looking to pursue an MS in data science. I applied to a couple of programs, and was accepted to Johns Hopkins' Online program, Columbia's MS in Data Science program, and NYU'S MS program.

Out of concern for cost, length, and lack of housing support, I've rejected NYU's offer and have narrowed it down to Columbia and JHU.

I do have a couple of questions however about Columbia's program (1.5 years full-time) before I make a decision.

- I did read that Columbia offers subsidized on-campus housing that it much cheaper than off-campus. However, they said that they would prioritize doctorates and international students. **How are my chances of me, a domestic MS student, of getting housing?** I would mainly look for suites with singles (private bedroom).
- NYU's Open House said that they regularly have ""data science only"" career fairs, which is exactly what it sounds like. **Does Columbia have something similar, and if not do they provide similar support for work?**
- The cost of JHU's online program is ~45k, while Columbia is ~60k, plus another 18-30k for housing. **How worth it is it to pay that much extra for a program that is on-site with the potential connections you might gather?**
- **Is it smarter to instead pay the deposit fee and start classes next year in 2020?** It would almost be like deferring.
- And of course, just my curiosity, **given the choice, which would you choose?**

As a last note, if I choose JHU I would most likely do part time job alongside. Additionally, the initial non-refundable deposit is pretty high at $2500 and I have to say by 11:59 PM EST on **April 15** so I don't have that much time either. Of course, one option is just to pay now and decide later, in case housing and other things don't work out, but $2500 going down the drain would be hard to swallow.

&amp;#x200B;

This study by FiveThirtyEight last year demonstrates the major biases Democrats have against Republicans and vice-versa. For example: An proportionally high percentage of Dem respondents believed way more Republicans are 65 years or older than is a reality. 

This is interesting to me because this study shows our biases in national and local politics...and about our neighbors. However, there's obviously a few major confounding factors about this study; one factor is obviously aggregating most blacks as Dems...while most ARE Dems, not all of them are.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm more interested in seeing a cross-tab study of this study regarding ages...my theory is that these biases tend to run older for Republicans but YOUNGER for Democrats. So my question r/datascience (also posted to r/statistics) is how one would conduct a preliminary study like this. 

1. How many people should I sample in surveying to get a reasonably accurate cross-tab by ages on this study?
2. What Python-specific statistical analyses should I perform to get better results?
3. Do you have any good reference studies (Source Code preferable) that could help me in performing this study?

Anything else I should know before tackling this?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read my post here. Leaving out key identifying details for privacy reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

My 5 year goal is to be in a Data Analyst or DBA position, while currently I'm in a Junior SysAdmin position, most of what I do is Application Analyst or reporting (w/ sql) because it's what i love doing. My current organization (Very large organization) has refused training and removed any career path within the company because of layoff's coming May 1st.

&amp;#x200B;

Certs; What SQL certifications could i obtain without spending a lot of money?

&amp;#x200B;

Jobs; What types of jobs could I consider to jump to before layoff's to advance my career? Currently thinking Application Analyst or Entry level Data Analyst but there's very few positions available in my location so I'm becoming desperate, I'd take anything for any pay as long as it's in the field of choice.

&amp;#x200B;

In Closing; I appreciate any advice or criticism to my post, life is a struggle and i'm trying to make decisions for the future.

I am the co-founder of Caliper ([caliper.ai](https://caliper.ai)). Caliper enables recruiters to evaluate practical AI skills through automated bite-sized challenges on real-world problems.

With the growing number of ML engineer positions in companies as well as relevant candidates, it seems useful to be able to evaluate a candidate's practical ML skills in a scalable way, in a screening stage, even before they come for an on-site interview.

This exists for testing CS algorithms and data structures in the usual coding interviews, but performance on those isn't necessarily correlated with practical ML skills.

It would be nice if recruiters or hiring managers could create a challenge around some data, invite candidates to participate in the challenge, see how they do, look at their code if they'd like, and then decide if they'd like to interview (and eventually hire!) the candidates.

Here's a post on the what, why, and how of Caliper's mission, and its guiding principles. [https://medium.com/caliper/introducing-caliper-3109fbd84513](https://medium.com/caliper/introducing-caliper-3109fbd84513)

I face senior data scientists at the consultancy startup I work for. Every day I face an issue or the other with them.

**TLDR:** Number of years worked apparently makes a better impression than the knowledge you have. And many of them are just plain insecure.

***

### Data Scientist 1

* My manager considers him as an expert in python because apparently in interviews, he asks only one question, and rejects people. Question - **what is the difference between a generator and a decorator?** I consider myself fairly good in python, but I do make it a point to give a disclaimer that I google a lot. When I first met this person, he asked me the same question *since* I said I'm good with python. I answered it correctly. Ever since then, he has always dodged my requests on learning from his work/experience.

* My manager has repeatedly told me to sit with senior data scientists and learn from them. I have requested them all. Particularly this person told me ""You should know your place. You are tasked with SQL, so focus on that. Fresh grads need to focus only on SQL and not on high level machine learning coding. Don't show fake enthusiasm for learning from my code. I will not share my code with you"".

* I created a custom class for my own personal use, and I was just going through it. I thought I could ask for some code review, and I did. He told me ""`@staticmethod` ? Oh you're using decorator inside class? Very nice very nice"" and he went about his business as usual. I got the feeling that either he doesn't know about `@staticmethod` or he just doesn't care about the code review.

### Data Scientist 2

* Asked me if I'm interested to learn. I (obviously) said yes. He told me to write a simple bash script for him/his project. I did and shared via Skype chat (as told by him). He went ahead and used my code in his scripts, and took credit for it. In the end, I noticed that he was learning from a Youtube tutorial how a while loop works in bash. Not only did he not give me due credit, I also found that he does not know bash programming. He does not know any programming as such. (he asked me if I would be interested in assisting him for his GSOC project(part time masters) that he's proposing, I declined, learnt my lesson)

### Data Scientist 3

* This person wants to ""keep me busy"" so he told me to create something with python classes and generate a report. I did. He showed it to his superiors that it was his own. Got all appreciation. This is the same person who gets confused when I explain ""instance, class, method, attribute"".

* I helped him set up a NoSQL DB via python. Again, no credit. None. This person told me that he didn't know NoSQL and that he was just learning it now.

### Data Scientist 4

* He does not create separate environments for his projects. He has so far broken 3 environments containing ML models before AND after deploying into production. He says base environment is enough for everything. 

* Due to the above error, he didn't read the error messages in `R console` where it clearly says that package is not installed. When I pointed that out to him, he told me that I'm wrong, that it will be installed since he knows what he's doing.

* Relating to environments error, I showed him that creating a separate environment with the package versions eliminates all the conflicts happening. He said I was lucky that I got it like that, apparently it's impossible to be error free.

* He is a kaggle kernel expert. Does not know SQL. Claims that data scientists work only with deep learning, ML, neural networks, and only analysts like me will work in SQL.

* Told me that as a fresh grad I should aim to learn from him, and not lecture him on what to do for environments and code and what not. ""I have 5 years experience as data scientist""

### Data Scientist 5

* Uses macbook, shits on my windows system saying it sucks. I asked him why. He showed me how he read an excel in a jupyter notebook. He was copy pasting the path of the file from `properties` by right-clicking it. He face unicode errors. I told him the problem is two fold. One is to use the proper slashes, and two to write the file extension. As a third I also asked him that if he is in the same directory as the file, why need the absolute path? He said that's how it works in production systems. (I was baffled)

* He didn't fix the slashes, and he wrote the file extension as `.xl`. I understand that someone not used to computers (like maybe my parents?) making such an error, but this person has worked as a data scientist for 4 years now. It's very surprising. It took me 45 mins to convince this person to read the excel properly using `pandas`. In the end, I get a ""Nice. I was just testing you. You do have python knowledge"".

* When I asked this person if I could sit with him and learn from him, he says ""Don't show your attitude. You need to put in the years before you can become a data scientist like me"".

### Data Scientist 6

* I asked him to help me understand and bring some context between statistics and machine learning. Like ""why exactly are we doing this, what will we achieve, any specific reason to test this hypothesis"" etc. He says ""forget statistics, learn everything on the go. Forget math. Just coding is enough.""


***

Lessons learnt so far in my first job:

1. Keep my manager (and client manager) on all my emails as cc. And especially, **email** whatever solutions/scripts/etc that others ask, so that I can get the credit I deserve.

2. Most ""data scientists"" are fake. The few good ones, are very rare and hard to find. Can be found only in product companies, or as high end freelance consultants (that's how I found my mentor now)

3. Keep my head down, stop showing enthusiasm to learn and grow. If people feel insecure that I can also learn from google and coursera? Fuck them. Might as well spend time improving my own skills instead of trying to kiss ass in a losing battle.

- the ability to do the experimentation work in the outer layer of the repo and import the r functions I create in the R package and the python modules I create in the python package without having to source them or clutter up the experimentation namespace with non-exported functions, plus avoiding having entirely separate packages that arent applicable beyond the project.

- using the best parts of both languages, optionally with eventually implementing in both.  Also when I am forced to do certain things in a particular language for other reasons.

A little bit of background - I volunteer as a data scientist for a non profit that combats human trafficking (East Coast USA).  I have previously worked at identifying commercial businesses that possibly engage in human trafficking by web scraping publicly available information and leveraging the non profits previously out reach to build supervised learning algorithms.  They used my results to prioritize outreach efforts.   


I was recently asked about the feasibility of measuring economic impact of businesses engaging in illegal activities.  I  believe they are interesting this information for lobbying (changes to local laws), donor outreach,  etc.   


So some thoughts/general brainstorming on this is that if a business is engaging in illegal activities you are could try to identify money loss in taxes.  I am slightly skeptical of the worth of this information in lobbying because if an act is already illegal I dont think highlighting estimated money lost in taxes would be very powerful in lobbying law changes but it seems the most obvious thing to try to measure (other than possible total revenue).    


Possible inputs:  
\- Businesses of interest  
\- Rough estimates of daily customer arrival rates (combination of google busy times and human made counts)  
\- Transaction costs  
\- Business license info   
\- Location building exterior characteristics (is it in a shopping center, stand alone, tinted windows, etc.)  
\- Consumer reviews  
\- Some locations have been identified as possibly engaging in illegal activities (though not necessarily human trafficking)  
\- Some locations have been identified as not engaging in illegal activities.   
\- Local demographic area  
Possible outputs:  
\- My initial inclination is to model arrival rates as a poisson distro (need to do research on if they should be modeled separately or if they can/should be averaged all together or by area or demographic region).  This could be used to calculate an average revenue.  
\- A comparison of arrival rates, transaction costs, and avg daily revenue between locations identified as possibly illegal activities and those that are not  
\- Assuming a tax rate, loss in tax revenue  
\- Outliers in revenue generated  
\- Comparison between sentiment of reviews and arrival rates

In the previous question I was asked how I would model the deterministic components of service demand on any given 1-hour time-window (for predicting how many users log in to the app during that hour in a certain area). I said I would use all available feature (date-time, weekday, working day/not, weekend/not, weather, etc) and construct a multiple linear /polynomial regression model to predict the number of users logging in any given hour

&amp;#x200B;

The following is my answer on how I would account for time series stochasticity (something I am less confident in):

 I said the short-term memory effect has to be taken into consideration, and one way would to do so would be to incorporate an Autoregressive model into the Multiple Regression model. This involves regressing the demand on lagged values, or demand from the previous few hours. By using lag values as features for multiple regression, I said I can likely come up with more accurate predictions. And of course, I mentioned that the number of lag terms to be included can be determined by using the Autocorrelation function (ACF)

As with many things, its often best to start with the basics. A generalist, when equipped with a few basic but well-understood tools, is surprisingly effective. Time spent really engaging with topics like the following will seldom be regretted!

Linear models and their modern extensions (GLMs, regularization)

Frequentist and Bayesian inference and its applications to experiments (bonus: causal inference, selection bias problems)

Optimization algorithms for fitting models (gradient methods, convex optimization)

Good engineering practices (organizing code, writing tests, version control)

I am a machine learning enthusiast constantly trying to challenge myself. Like most of you I want to learn all there is to know about this wonderful field. With this in mind, I decided I am going to attempt to create a model that can predict the number of lifetime citations from the content of a paper. Previous attempts by other researchers have attempted to predict the number of citations based off of author name, length of publication, and other such features. Few, however, have tried to use the content of the paper to predict lifetime number of citations. I have created a GitHub repository for this project here

[https://github.com/Andrew-Pynch/Paper-Predictor](https://github.com/Andrew-Pynch/Paper-Predictor)

Additionally, I have created a discord server to discuss project development. If you are interested in participating please comment here, join the discord server [https://discord.gg/c7x8bJh](https://discord.gg/c7x8bJh), or email me at [andrewpynchbusiness@gmail.com](mailto:andrewpynchbusiness@gmail.com)

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently studying Economics and Political Science. I have taken a mixture of courses from both majors - the most enjoyable  ones, however, were more of the research and quantitative methods/math-ey ones. I had continually thought these courses were merely ""interesting"" and that they weren't serve me much in the career I had originally planned; I wanted to become a lawyer. It wasn't until this semester that I was completely wrong in that aspect. 

For the sake of not making this post too long: I am taking econometrics and survey methods courses this semester, as well as doing some research for a polling institution (with slight work in SPSS). I have realized, that the statistical methodology and software (e.g. R, Python, SAS, SPSS) used to describe and analyze the content from said courses (as well as examining the syllabi for advanced econometrics/statistics courses) are not only incredibly fascinating, but also is something I would like to do for a living. Every time I am tasked with anything related to data cleaning, gathering, and modeling, I'd always ask myself, ""How can I effectively clean this data? Which regression model would work best to describe the relationship? Is my analysis far off from what could be the truth?"".  Now, I'm aware that econometrics isn't all what data science is about, but every time I read up stuff about data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, predictive analytics, etc., I get really engaged and curious. Such was the decision that made me want to pursue a career in data science instead of law.

The main problem that I see myself confronting, however, is: Do I have a chance to get accepted in a master's program in data science? I've done a lot of research into DS master's programs - mostly those in NY. Just about most of them require that prospective students have at least: Calc III, Linear Algebra, and introductory computer science coursework (and, for some, courses in probability and statistics). Needless to say, it's too late to apply to them now. But, I'll apply next semester, and can expect that I will have all of these prerequisites done by graduation (next year; requires that I drop my Political Science major to a minor one). But, I'm insecure and nervous about the application process. I don't come from a ""hard-core"" relevant STEM (e.g. math, stats, or comp sci)  background - only a social science one. The most I can do is have all the prerequisites done and hope for the best (**I could, however, drop my two probability and statistics courses for a quantitative poli/sci thesis, but I'm not sure how much that's valued**). But, even then, there's still the unknown probability that I'll get rejected from all the schools (especially my top choice school) that I'll apply to next semester, which would be really upsetting.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions for this would be: Do you think it is still possible for me to be at least competitive for DS master's programs, despite my background? What else, do you suggest, I should do before I apply to these DS schools? How much is an undergraduate thesis valued in the eyes of DS master's admission committees/officers?  And what other advice or tips would you give me as an aspiring data scientist, who doesn't come from the traditional CS background?",4,1,False,self,,,,,

It pays well if you are good but you really have to understand the dynamics of your company and the people you work with. That real talent comes with more than just a few years of experience. 

Here are some other reasons

Its easier to transition from engineering or data science to management than vice versa. Once your branded product manager, its harder to shake off that brand if you want to go back to being a techie. 

Its also harder to get a new job in management at a different company than it is to get another job in engineering. This is because of the way fewer openings for management in comparison to data science/engineering. 

Job security is a big reason too. Junior product managers are more likely to be laid off when the bottom line goes south than say a junior engineer. Lots of companies have this notion that product managers at the lower levels can be easily replaced but the same cant be said for techies. 

However...

if your calling really is one of those management roles, my tip is do this after you level up in the engineering/data science realm. That is dont jump ship as a junior data engineer of data scientist to product manager. Do this after you become say a senior data scientist/data engineer. 

Why? Youll have much more respect as a manager if you could say you were a senior data scientist or senior engineer prior to the role. The engineering/data team will respect your tech credentials more and will be more likely to listen to your feature enhancements or timelines for completion as you know the product that well.

I'm doing a psychology major because I never knew what I wanted to do in life. Was never motivated for school but all of that changed!

I know, I might sound like another guy that just got on the 'data science' hype train, but I like to believe that I'm different.

I'm planning to do a computer science minor where I'll get some preperatory subjects that involve things like machine learning. This is the first time in my life that I'm actually liking to learn anything for school and my motivation level has never been this high.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely willing to  give up my psychology major and start over completely, this is how desperately I feel attached the job as a data scientist because of what I've heard from professors, heard from people on the internet, and heard from conferences about the topic data science.

There is this master in data science, that accepts someone with a psychology bachelor as major degree.

I do wonder however if this isn't some popular 'put data science in the name of it' scam masterr. Why do I think this?

&amp;#x200B;

* The master gives subjects in
   * Machine Learning
   * Data Mining for Business and Governance
   * Data Science Regulation and Law
   * Data Processing
   * Programming with R

&amp;#x200B;

* the master doesn't require any background in:
   * lin algebra
   * calculus 
   * (it does require you to be able to program in python tho (which I'm already familiar with)

&amp;#x200B;

Reading the internet - &gt; I wonder how it's possible to get these subjects without that math background.

Should I go for this master,

or 

start over with a new bachelor/ self learn myself lin algebra and calculus?

My scenario:

I have performed some compression tests of various structures, 24 test samples in total. 

These structures are categorized by two ""classes"" of pitch values, 6 and 8. 

Both of these 2 ""classes"" have 4 corresponding ""subclasses"" offsets, so that the samples are named 6-0, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, 8-0, 8-1, 8-2, 8-4, respectively.

How can I create plots that show the displacement (x-variable) versus force ( y-variable) for each class and subclass?

A popular opinion is that Data Scientists need to do machine learning or they're not real data scientists.

I think this completely misses the point of job titles: job titles are not meant to define a role. Job titles are meant to be corporate abbreviations for job descriptions. It is job descriptions that are matched against outside salary references, and it is job descriptions that are graded for pay purposes. Job descriptions are used for hiring purposes and ultimately job descriptions describe the job that you do.

There are some professions where titles have very real meanings (Lawyers who pass the bar exam, Professional Engineers who pass the P.E. exam, Accountants who are certified CPAs, etc.), but the majority of titles don't mean anything, and Data Scientist is certainly in that camp.

Other examples:

- At a lot of large corporation, you see Sr. Managers that don't manage anyone (i.e., have no direct reports).

- Every person in national/executive sales is a VP, even though they are not responsible for a P&amp;L and often don't even have direct reports. Oh, and they make less money than a Director in every other branch of the company.

- Every bank title is incredibly inflated (again, TONS of VPs)

- Every quant/trading title is incredibly deflated - they'll seemingly call someone an analyst their whole lives even if they're making 400k and have 15 years experience.

The only constraints on job titles are often internal, and a consequence of how they fit relative to existing internal job descriptions. Specifically, if a specific job title term (e.g., Engineer, Analyst, Consultant) has traditionally been associated with a certain set of skills and responsibilities, a new role that has completely new requirements should in general avoid using the same title.

So why are so many companies giving Data Science titles to people who don't do Machine Learning given that the original data scientists had to? Here is what the life-cycle of creating a role looks like *at a company that doesn't have existing data science capabilities*:

1) Hiring manager decides she needs a new person with a profile that doesn't exist in the form of an existing job description. She needs this person to do mostly analysis, but she also needs them to be able to write code in Python to automate some processes, build the occasional model (likely not a production model), and access back-end databases directly and often. She may also, in time, need this person to dedicate more time to building more advanced statistical models, maybe even ML models, but as of right now that is highly uncertain because the company has never used ML in the past.

2) After writing this job description, the key hitting points look something like this: 

* Must have 2+ years experience with R/Python
* Must have 2+ years experience with SQL
* Must have experience building statistical models.
* A whole bunch of business and soft skills stuff

3) HR receives this job description and they now need to grade it. Since they have Analyst/Sr Analyst roles already, they compare the job description against those roles. They quickly find that none of those job descriptions require R/Python, SQL or building models. But they do match a lot of the other requirements, so it becomes clear that they will need a different type of role that is both different (includes Python/SQL/Modeling) and higher (more requirements) than the existing Analyst/Sr. Analyst roles. They may have even higher levels of Analyst (Lead, Principal), but none of them will require the use of Python/SQL/Modeling, so the fact of the matter is that they are going to need to get away from the Analyst title or otherwise create confusion and internal inconsistencies.

4) In order to do their benchmarking, HR pulls salaries and comp from an external data source that helps them match job description requirements to those posted by other companies. They work their way through putting the job description requirements into the system, and the system tells HR what jobs with similar JDs pay, including a range. It also tells this person the titles of the people who have similar JDs - which will likely include jobs that are legitimate Data Science jobs as they require R, Python, SQL, and statistical modeling experience. But it also will include some Analyst roles that do require programming skills (maybe some quant roles), and other random role titles that no one would think of looking into. All in all, the job grade that comes back is higher than an Analyst role (because of the added skills), but not quite as high as that of the first-gen Data Scientists, i.e., Ph.D. + 5 years experience in Silicon Valley. 

5) Now they need a job title. They know they can't name the role ""Analyst"" or ""Sr. Analyst"" because the skill set (and job grading) is different. Therefore they want to avoid having one ""Analyst"" making considerably more money than the rest of the Analysts, and also would like to make it clear that current Analysts may not have the skillset needed for this new role. They may, but it cannot be assumed by default that they do. They currently don't have any data scientists, so there's no toes to step on there, so it becomes a natural solution to name this new role ""Data Scientist"". Why that and not a completely new title to avoid clashing with the existing Data Scientist roles that are more senior in the marketplace?

* **You want a title that can be easily found by people with the right skillset**: because the candidate you are looking for has some characteristics of an old school data scientist and some of an analyst, you want to hit with a title that will catch the high-end of the pool you're looking for. ""Analyst"" may leave some of those people out. 

* **You want the role to be easy to find**: you can title the job ""Programming Friendly Analyst"", but it would just make it harder to get it to show up on searches. Meanwhile, because people are searching for the Data Scientist role often, it gives you better visibility. 

And there you have it, you now have a Data Scientist opening that you can post. Odds are you will get a wide range of candidates applying, including some who will be greatly overqualified (but will inquire because of the Data Science title being so variable), but you will end up hiring someone who is, ideally, at the top end of your requirements.

More importantly, as more and more companies do this, the general convergence is not based on original data science roles, but rather the new data science roles that are going to be more common because they will fill a need in a much larger market (i.e., more companies need people to tame their data and run basic modeling, fewer companies are ready for cutting edge ML).

You will certainly have organizations where step 5 is different, i.e., where the ""Analyst"" roles already have programming requirements (quants, consulting are all great examples), and in that case it makes sense that Data Scientist will be defined as ""can do ML"", because the only reason to create a new role will be to differentiate people who can do analysis, modeling, and programming from those who can do all of those things AND build machine learning models.

And then you have the even more extreme examples, FANGs, where you are seeing the creation of roles that are even more technical than Data Scientist (like Applied Scientist and Research Scientist and ML Engineer), which - again - were likely required to create internal differentiation between people who can execute machine learning models vs. people who can develop brand new machine learning concepts/scale machine learning to solve massively complex applications/etc.

On to my last point: to those who are on the cutting edge of machine learning and AI knowledge who feel ""icky"" getting lumped in with us simpletons who are just running fancy regression models to make our companies more money - just know that the reason your salaries are continuing to increase is because the number of companies hiring Data people like myself to solve simpleton problems is blowing up the market, and creating a scarcity everywhere in the field that is driving salaries up. So, while I understand that you like the prestige of having a title that reflects just how much more about machine learning you know that the rest of us, please appreciate that the popularity of the general field of Decision Science has greatly benefited you directly.

**TL;DR: No one company/group of people get to dictate what is/isn't a ""Data Scientist"". It is a natural response of the market to allow those companies looking for employees to find the right job seekers while satisfying internal corporate constraints. To continue to argue about who is/isn't a data scientist is pointless, because the title itself actually doesn't mean anything. Most importantly, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we have all benefited from the demand for all types of data scientists.**",81,304,False,self,,,,,

Most of my cohort still is unemployed. Why? Many didnt do quantitative degrees prior to the bootcamp. The ones who did land jobs happened to have a technical background prior to the bootcamp. 

So people ask why even do a data science bootcamp in the first place? 

(1) bootcamps will train you to create a portfolio of data science projects that you can show your future employers. You can create the basic Ames housing competition but you will also do nlp for Reddit posts, time series for the West Nile virus Kaggle data set, and a capstone of your choice. Could university do this? Sure but many dont. 

(2) you will greatly improve certain aspects of your data science background considerably. This mostly will be your python/sql abilities. Yes school teaches you python and sql but if all you have is a semester or two, chances are you probably will forget. A data science bootcamp will make you code in python for several hours and home some of these skills. Bootcamps are 8 hours a day and five days a week. This helps greatly for the technical interviews at most companies. 

(3) boot camps will make you realize that your fellow student is a great teacher. A lot of data science isnt just clean, apply logistic regression, get 99% accuracy and youre done. Its also understanding how to approach different data science problems. When you see 15 presentations on how to accurately predict housing prices in Iowa, you learn a lot about how to approach this problem in multiple angles. This will make you a better thinker and speaker. 

(4) connections- if you do a bootcamp in San Francisco, Im not gonna lie...its not cheap...but a lot of the bootcamps career coaches are connected with employers and can hook you up. Thats appealing especially in a competitive market like San Francisco. 

Downsides
Many data science bootcamps struggle to find teachers who are experts in the field. Why? Industry scoops them up with much higher salaries. You may end up learning from an unemployed former bootcamp grad. That might mean you wont get a full understanding of all the concepts especially more advanced concepts such as markov chains. 

Many employers wont look at your resume if you dont have a cs or math or stats degree. Theres already so many that do so why consider yours. Also how does a 12 week program replace what four years of college can teach? Some claim it can but its met with a lot of skepticism.",15,10,False,self,,,,,

\- Free  
\- Low hassle  
\- Automated  
\- Reliable  


Right now I use a combination of Python scripts to connect with databases, retrieve data from those databases with some SQL scripts I execute through Python scripts and some batch files to execute these Python scripts / SQL commands at certain times. This looks a bit like this:   


    import pyodbc 
    import pandas as pd
    
    conn = pyodbc.connect('Driver={SQL Server};'
                          'Server=server_name;'
                          'Database=db_name;'
                          'Trusted_Connection=yes;')
    
    query = ('SELECT * FROM db_name.Table')
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
    df.to_excel(""output.xlsx"")
    
    &lt;some script to e-mail users with this output&gt;

This is free and automated but a lot of hassle to maintain and frankly I'm one of the few guys who understands the codebase. I'd rather use some tooling if I can so new functionality is added and thoroughly tested instead of custom made by me. 

  
Solutions I'm considering: 

\- Power BI paginated report builder (we use PBI for data viz / dashboard building). This has the advantage that it's point and click but the disadvantage that you're locked into PBI and don't need the extra functionality when all I want to share is a list of data. 

\-  SQLCMD + job scheduler in SQL Server Agent. No experience with this option yet.

I have a question. I am finishing my BSc in business, which is followed by a specialization MSc of chosen area. I was choosing between Finance and BI/Data Science/analytics. It was a very hard decision, because i enjoyed finance a bit more, but was told the other options is super high in demand. On top of that I thought as long as I am interested in Finance i will also learn finance more and more anyway, whereas if i choose Finance, i won't learn much of data science on my own.

I was planning to do CFA for myself, as AM is probably the reason why i loved finance, I am obsessed about figuring out optimal portfolio based on what specific untradeable assets i own and so on.

Therefore I came to a conclusion - is BI/Data science combinable with CFA? It is a weird combo/rare combo/maybe good combo, but also risky combo, because AM+Data science is such a specific area.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to break into the data analysis field and I feel like I am getting close. I graduated nearly a year ago with a degree in physics from a good university. I have strong skills in python and excel along with basic knowledge of SQL. I made a few projects in python, the most notable one is a machine learning model I trained that predicts sports games which is on my GitHub. 

For the last year I have been working for a small company where I started a project entering our client data to excel and doing some analysis. Other than that I have no relevant internships and I think that is a big hurdle for me. 

I have been getting some interviews lately and I think I am close to getting my first real data analysis job but I feel I am falling just a little short and I need to add another project or technology to put me over the top. 

Some options I was considering: Learning Tableau basics, Improve my SQL skills by doing some sort of project with it or doing another python project using some machine learning algorithms.

I'm recruiting for software developers specifically, but I'm guessing that my experience is relevant for Data Science as well.

I've seen several threads recently debating the merits/importance of the actual job title ""Data Scientist.""  I've commented something to the effect of: I don't think it's the most important thing in the world, but I also don't think it's meaningless.   
So I'd like to give some insight as to where I think it does and doesn't matter.

In my current role at ""large tech company,"" I source resumes from an internal database based on whatever logic my imagination can come up with.  I might choose to search for ""software developer"" or I might choose to search for ""java OR c++ OR scalability OR service oriented architecture"" - in other words, I can search for job titles if I want, or I can search for key words / skillsets.  The reality is that it's not lost on recruiters that job titles can be highly variable, so more often than not, we're looking for the skillsets / the keywords we expect to represent them.  So that's how we find resumes and get you into the whole coding test, phone screen, etc process.  So the next question is: how does your job title affect salary should you receive an offer?  At my company it flat out doesn't.  The salary ranges are set internally based on the job we're recruiting for.  There's room for negotiation and exceptions and all of that, but that's a conversation that happens so far down the line that the real technical folks already have a good understanding of who you are.  So I can say with confidence that: 1) recruiters know there is variability in job titles, but usually have a more specific idea of what skills they're looking for and adjust their strategies accordingly, and 2) it really doesn't affect your salary if you're hired.  So in the context of a large tech company with recruiters sourcing for candidates, the job title is not that important.  If you don't have the actual job title ""Data Scientist"" then just make sure that you write ""Data Science"" somewhere on your resume just in case.

Now let me tell you where I think the job title might actually matter: at smaller companies that don't have sophisticated recruiting operations.  I've worked at a start up where literally the founder of the company found me on LinkedIn directly. And I can almost guarantee that he found me simply by searching for ""Data Science + &lt;city&gt;.""  Now, it's possible that in those search results he found people with the actual job title ""Data Scientist"" but also people who just have Data Science mentioned in their profile.  It's hard to say what heuristics he used to filter down those results, but I have to imagine this is something that really changes on a case to case basis.  If I'm looking to hire someone, questions I might ask myself are - do I need an experienced Data Scientist? can I just train an aspiring Data Scientist instead?  All of those types of considerations affect what someone looking to hire for a Data Science role is going to do and there are too many possibilities to generalize on the importance or lack thereof of the title.  The answer is definitely maybe!

The last consideration that I'd like to address is how the job title pertains to perceptions of career progression and seniority.  That's definitely something recruiters look for when they're hiring for non entry level positions.  But from my experience so far, I think that if you have the appropriate years of relevant experience, an odd looking career progression might get noticed and asked about later on, but I think it's less likely to be used as a reason to screen you out early in the process.  

I could go an ad nauseam, but I think I'll just end this here.  I hope this helps people at least a little.",46,167,False,self,,,,,

Specifically I expect that the residuals will be much smaller for lower income customers than for higher income customers.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it would usually be best practice to apply some sort of non-linear transformation to my dependent variable to correct for this, but I'm wondering if this is necessarily the right thing to do because of the context in which this model will be used.

&amp;#x200B;

Higher income customers are likely to pass the affordability assessment regardless, and an estimate of their salary that is out by 20% is much less likely to affect the decision of whether to lend to them. In contrast a customer with low income is more likely to be on the margin in terms of whether they should receive lending, and an estimate that is out by 20% will have a big influence on the decision, which will have some potentially serious consequences for the lender and the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are my options in this scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought is leave it as it is, don't try to correct for hetero-scedasticity, with the justification that it is desirable in this context. Added to this is the fact that interpretability is very important to stakeholders, and if I were to say, predict log(income) instead of income, some would be uncomfortable with a model that isn't linear- they would want to be able to follow the calculation easily, with interpretable coefficients etc.. A downside I can imagine is that the confidence intervals would be a bit meaningless, but these wouldn't really be taken into account operationally anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thought I had would be to use a non-linear transformation like log to make it more homo-scedastic, and weight the lower income data points to make sure the model performs better on the marginal customers. I don't know if this is common practice though, so a I'm a bit wary of this approach.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be really interested to hear some thoughts on this.

Hi everyone, I would like to get some insights regarding my current job situation.

 

**Premise:**

* Been at current job for 5 years (promoted twice)
* Started out as a Reporting Analyst 
* Scope expanded through the years, involvement with projects, management reporting 

 

**Considerations:**

* Predominantly working with Microsoft Excel, organization has recently introduced newer analytical / visualization software
* Very stressful hours, averaging 12 to 14 hour days, mostly due to too many overlapping deadlines and outdated processes
* High turn over rate and difficulty in locating replacements
* My direct manager is leaving the team, leaving myself, a new hire (less than 3 months), 2 contract staff

 

The majority of my day to day work involves Excel reporting and some data analysis; over the years we have attempted to optimize processes through VBA macros, building and maintenance of localized database for data retrieval. The reporting work is relatively mundane, we have pre-saved SQL queries and excel templates and users just have to perform some manipulations to the raw data.

  

We have been in survival mode for the last 2 years, struggling to get up to speed with the day to day reporting requirements. (2 team members left). The work is tedious due to the sheer amount of reports required. We have reached out to management to review the decommissioning of reports that are no longer required, but the business teams have consistently raised their objections.

While this was going on, I  have completed classes to improve my foundation in data analytics (statistics, predictive modeling, text and data mining foundations, hands on usage of data analytics software).  As it stands, I am continuing to self learn Python and Tableau. 

  

On the other front, the organization is advancing slowly, introducing more analytical and visualization tools for usage. The main challenge I face now is that I barely have the time to fulfill our daily reporting requirements. The only way I get to devote any attention to implementing process enhancements / using these new tools is to come back to work on the weekends. The current process enhancements on my roadmap:

 

* Using Tableau to retire our older Excel dashboards
* Using Python scripts to automate existing Excel reports
* Conceptualization and building of our division's data warehouse to be synced with the rest of the organization

  

I recognize that I need to improve my skillsets in order to advance further into data analytics, but my current workload is making it really challenging. With the departure of my direct manager,  I find myself having to stand in for his position and am loaded with additional managerial responsibilities. Judging from the past track record, it would take more than a year to find his replacement.  
 

It feels like a catch 22 situation here. I am not technically skilled enough to cross over into data analytics and starting from a entry level or junior position would most likely result in a steep pay-cut. But the longer I stay in the organization, the more burnt out I get and the lesser time I have to focus on my self development. The last thing I'd want is to be stuck in a position where I am overpaid yet only equipped with a limited repertoire of competencies.

Would love to hear some insights on how I should approach this dilemma. Thank you and sorry for the wall of text!

Found this sub a while back and have loved piggy backing on a lot of the advice. But was hoping to get some discussion on where I am going in my career/in my company. Let me make this very clear before I get roasted- I am not a data scientist. I am a financial analyst and all senior management hears is ""analyst"". 

It started when I landed a job underwriting commercial debt, with it came the bitch work sincr I was the new guy... was given a lot of shitty reports to make up each week/month/quarter/year. Well I  hated those reports, so I self studied and figured out how to automate them using vba. Eventually automating most my job.. Well to better benefit the company I started walking around my department automating everything with shitty vba scripts. 

All of senior management caught a hold of this and thought I should do it for the whole company.  I realized I couldn't use vba for everything unless the whole thing was gonna implode. So I got with our IT department who had an abandoned data warehouse project. I figured out enough sql to get all of our core systems pointed at it with some help from IT setting up FTPs. And set up the reports to automate out of this warehouse. 

Well after the reports were set up, I started getting into financial modeling, and realized I could just practice on my company. Senior Management's buzzword of the month was ""OKR"" at this point, so I thought up of some undeniable OKRs and set up a little dashboard for our loan officers so they could track those and their incentives themselves. My management then demands I make this dashboards for everyone. 

Well they want to promote me and give me the title ""Senior Data Analyst"", comes with a pretty cool raise too and I am pretty much my own boss with no direct over sight. But idk how I feel about the position because I don't know what I could do next. They will also pay for me to get a masters in data science from a decent state school. 

tldr; not actually a data analyst, just automated all our reports and built some dashboards that track okrs &amp; incentives. Have a ton of career momentum right now because of it - what are some new things I can do next? Assume I work for a company from the 1980s, and am willing to self teach anything.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm sorry.  


But I'm trying to know what to do in my situation.  


**Here is my situation: (sorry in advance if I put too much useless information about me)**  
I'm finishing a business degree at the moment in IT. (probably called MIS in usa I think?)  
I did some CS classes but dropped out.

**More about me:** 

I feel like in business I don't really belong since I'm not excellent at communication. I'm quiet a shy person too. Also, I find people in my business degree, kind of dumb (most of them). When I was in CS,  I felt like people were actually smart (well most of them). When I think about it, maybe I dropped CS because I was too lazy but keep telling myself I dropped out because I didn't like it. I don't know.   
I'm also introvert and like logic, problem solving, video games , etc.  


**My question is:**  
Since I don't have a STEM degree should I go for a master degree in DataScience.   
Cost is around $15-20 000 for the 2year degree. The degree includes: Algorithm for optimization and Big Data analysis, Decision analysis, forecasting methods, Machine learning, machine learning 2 , dvanced statistical learning, statistical modeling etc.  
I know some people recommend to do CS instead, but since I don't have a degree in CS. Masters in CS would be near impossible. That is why I'm considering data science/data analytics degree",8,4,False,self,,,,,

Also, I come from a nonCS (biochemistry) undergrad but I have done lots of research as an undergrad and I am published.

It appears there are 3 things to consider:
1. No CS background
2. Student at different university (non-international so study abroad doesnt apply)
3. A masters student (not a PhD)

Ideally Id spend the entire 2 year program working in research but I may have a hard time convincing a PI to take me in being unproven.
Alternatively, I could wait 1 or 2 semesters and then ask for an opportunity. Although I dont know if they would be as receptive for just a year long stint.

Where we have USER table with the userID, account creation date, number of followers, number of following, description, handle, gender, and other important profile info and table POSTS with the posts on social media with the no of likes, no of comments, reach, date, date posted, trending etc. Then I also have csv full of comments which I'm not using for the analysis now.

Now I want to create a model that will score these posts based on the popularity and performance. So my first and my very naive approach was to split the POSTS into the train and test randomly. Then on the train, I would group by the userId and create aggregate features ['sum', 'max', 'min', 'mean', 'var'] on the different numeric columns. Then I would add merge this data to the USER with its own numeric columns, I would call this table HISTORY, which would give us the past performance of the post. Then the really stupid thing I did (I think?) was to add the HISTORY data back to the train POSTS (yes, the same one which I used to aggregate features of) and test POSTS.

The scoring metric I used to score the post was sigmoid(log(like+1) + log(reach + 1) + log(no of comments + 1) + log(trending + 1)) which yielded a score between 0 and 1. But there was an excess amount of posts with score 0. So while training I had to undersample the zero scores. And I used the Post Time + History to predict this particular score.

So I'm doing self-directed learning this data-set and it's kind of an outsourced work to me and I feel like I'm stuck making progress in the wrong direction. I think I went wrong on the following places

 Creating a proper metric for scoring the posts, a better way to score posts?
 Using the train data to generate aggregate history than using the same train data to append this history onto. 
 Splitting the train and test data randomly. Because in this case, if a post on the train is a user's first post, I would add the HISTORY to this post but that doesn't make any sense in reality.
 The data is spread over 2 years, is some inconsistency going to creep up?
 Most of the scoring lies in this [distribution](https://imgur.com/JaXQBpJ), I would like it to be spread out. 
 To judge the performance of the model, I was using Precision. The number of high-quality posts, which was actually scored high. Is this a proper metric to use? Can we actually use the confusion matrix here by setting a threshold on the score to differentiate between posts that scored high and low?
 How to prepare train and test data? Should I use 70% Posts to aggregate features, then use 25% for training and 5% for testing?
 
I feel like I've approached this problem wrong from the first step itself and I did a lot of thinking to myself but I'm incapable of figuring out what's wrong. Any insights, tips and resources would literally save my life.

* Engine Mileage vs Maintenance Effort, or 
* Car Mileage vs Reliability

The problem is that the company is a rather large financial institution and uses 70% SAS, 30% Python/R. I know python and R and thus was looking forward to working with such frameworks (pytorch, tensorflow, ie open source) and definitely not SAS. They did tell me they were moving towards greater flexibility, but this would take years.

(I know SQL and Spark are used too)

Regarding the company, it is a good place to work, salary however is average.

I can't decide if I should accept the offer or keep looking for a different role. The fatigue and lack of money stress are kicking in as well.

Any advice? Would this role be a good start or would it rather limit, restrict my abilities and learning?

Background: 
I'm a second year PhD student doing genomics in a basic research institute in Germany.  I have slowly realized that my passion is not about biology but much rather the data analysis itself. In the last 3 years I have become quite skillful with R and python. I have learned a lot on my own through online courses and by applying it to my research. I am currently at a state where I dread working in the wet lab entirely, trying to spend as much time as possible analyzing my data in different ways and learning new tools. I am also taking statistics and machine learning courses during work even though its quite unlikely that I will need them for my actual project.

Bottomline is that I am now 100% sure that I want to transition into a data science career. 
Keeping this goal in mind what do you think is the smarter move for me? To finish my PhD which will take another 2.5-3 years and transition then OR transition now into a job in industry. How valuable is a PhD in Biology after I have transitioned? 

I have already an offer from a tech consulting company here in Germany for an entry level Data Scientist position. They even offer a 6-month transition period where I can focus most of my time doing workshops and courses for things like SQL, TensorFlow etc.

I took intro statistics, ANOVA, and multivariate statistics with the psychology department (so it was mostly applied statistics, not heavy on the math) plus Modern Statistical Modeling and Linear Regression Models/ANOVA with the math department (so more math heavy, and far more difficult for me). I enjoyed and did well in all of these courses, and then promptly forgot nearly everything about them after graduating. Outside of school I havent used statistics at all. Ive always been interested in programing, but havent been motivated enough to learn on my own. I feel like I do better in a classroom environment or learning on the job. With programing its mostly been wow, it would sure be neat if I could do XYZ Ive been out of the classroom for 5 years.

I currently work in a university setting as a Research Analyst. Its mostly excel pivot tables, merging data files in SPSS, basic SQL querying, reporting descriptive statistics, and working with a data visualization tool without proper background knowledge on how the underlying data warehouse even works (literally self-taught and I am the expert in the office on the front end of the tool, while our data architect is the expert on the data warehouse). I worked with Access a few times after taking a Data Management certificate course and thought it was pretty interesting, but there was very little depth to it and even less application to my current job.

Ive been looking at online masters programs and the course descriptions get me so excited. I could re-learn statistics! About databases! Python, which theoretically would make some of my projects at work easier to do! I read the course descriptions and I think I want to be good at that thing.

I was wondering how advanced the statistics that you/analysts use on a typical day are? I'm a little nervous about a position I've received as an analyst, and I'd like to know where I should try to review and improve on before it begins. I am really familiar with descriptive statistics, as well as simple models and techniques. What gets me are some of the more advanced techniques, weighted LS, Standardized regression, etc... I can probably do them but it's hard for me to recognize where to apply them and I don't have a super deep understanding of how they work. Here is a list of statistics stuff I can remember off the top of my head:

&amp;nbsp;

- Summary Statistics (Mean / Median / Quartiles / Variance / Bias)  
- Discrete Probability (Dices / Coins and more specific examples)  
- Probability Distributions (Normal, Chi Squared, etc)  
- Hypothesis Testing (Comparing to standard pdf type stuff)  
- Multiple Linear &amp; Non Linear Regression  
- Clustering models (KNN, Hierarchical)  
- Trees and Bagging  
- Bootstraping / Cross validation / LASSO  
- Discriminant Analysis / Principal Components Analysis / Factor Analysis  
- Neural Networks  
- Likelihood, Score Functions, Exponential Families  

How advanced are the statistics that you do on a daily basis? I can pretty easily handle descriptive statistics (comparing means / quartiles / deviations etc) and simple regression and clustering models. I can test models as well and am familiar with concepts like overfitting, central limit, law of large numbers. 

From what I can read, a lot of analysts work with KPI's and less with model building, so it seems mostly descriptive analysis is used. Do you spend a lot of time searching for correlations and understanding the data more than analysing it? Like, it's easy to build a linear regression model with data, but understanding correlation and other things that might be affecting your data is the actual challenge? I don't know, I just feel like if I fit a simple regression on some data and then some company policy was implemented, there would be some caveat that makes it wrong. 

For instance, suppose there's linear relationship between time spent on shopping cart page vs purchase. It may seem like we would want to increase time spent on the shopping cart page, but in actuality the people who spend a short amount of time on the shopping cart page are actually just giving up very fast at understanding how the page works, so only those who spend time figuring it out will proceed to purchase. I don't see how I can consider every single situation like this.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Hello, my name is Alexander and I'm a recent graduate of [The Data Incubator](http://thedataincubator.com) program.

Today I'd like to share my experience with you and give a more in-depth review for those who might be considering the program as a way to break into data science.

I know before I joined the program [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) was an invaluable tool in making my final decision to attend and this in-depth (read: way too long) review is my small attempt to give back. I also think that my perspective is somewhat unique in that most of the existing great reviews out there are from a fresh grad/post-doc perspective while mine is one from someone who is already an experienced professional looking to transition into a data science role.

#About Me

I'm [formerly trained in computer science](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandersack314/) and have been a senior software engineer for over 15 years. I started my career with a deep love of operating systems and UNIX (I'm getting old, I remember installing RedHat from a dozen or so floppy disks) so the first half of my career has been spent writing fairly low-level/high performant (well, sometimes) code mainly in C. So think storage and network drivers, boot code, general platform work. My career has been mostly defined by that kind of work up until now.

In 2016, I read [""The Great A.I. Awakening"" in the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html) and was completely blown away by it. The only time I have ever heard of anything related to neural networks was the venerable perceptron algorithm which I knew was [used on some CPUs for branch prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/903263). But I had no idea how far the AI community had come in such a short period of time with deep learning and vowed that I wanted to be part of the action too! Since then I've taken numerous online MOOCs on machine learning and now consider [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) to be one of my closest friends (disclaimer: I have never met Professor Ng).

#About The Data Incubator (TDI)

If you aren't familiar with [TDI's Fellowship program](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html), it is considered by many to be one of the premier data science bootcamps in the country (US anyway). It is an eight week program that is supposed to not only teach you the foundations of data science but also help you land a job through their every expanding partner network. Their main competitor is probably [Insight](https://www.insightdatascience.com) but they also now compete against numerous other data science multi-week camps such as [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/) and [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com) too to name a few.

## Admission Process

What's makes TDI somewhat different than other bootcamps is that their is indeed a formal admission process which is broken down into three rounds:

* Resume/CV review
* Project challenge
* Capstone pitch (video/preso)

My guess is the majority of folks get past the first round provided you have a graduate degree from a [reputable university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO1061QisVs) but get rejected in the second round during the project challenge phase. They claim their acceptance rate is 2-3% which is about right: My cohort I think had ~4k applicants with a little less than 36 attending.

The project challenge is actually broken down into two or three subprojects with each subproject covering areas of probability, statistics, and basic data science (mostly dataset handling and EDA, not modeling). I would say knowledge of Python is pretty much required to get through the challenges intact. To give you a flavor of what a challenge might be without getting too specific:

TDI will send you a link to a midsized dataset (at least a few gigabytes of entries) and ask you to perform some in-depth EDA about it. For the stats/probs part, they will ask you to write some code to simulate an experiment and ask prob/stats questions about it. So I would say if you are looking to ""book-up"" for the admissions process you should be fairly comfortable with Python, pandas/numpy, web scraping, and SQL. Obviously, challenge questions will vary with each cohort but my guess is they are all similar with respect to the skillsets you need to do them. You have a few days to finish it and can submit as many times as you want, i.e. you can work on some, submit, work on another part, submit, redo the first section, submit, etc.

I talked to several classmates about the challenge project and I think on average most folks said they spent at least 20 hours working on it - so be prepared. The admission process says it takes a few hours to finish but that is just not realistic unless you happen to be not only fluent in the above technologies (I was) but also familiar with the dataset in question (obvioulsy not).

Frankly, I found the challenge to be a lot of fun! I got to flex my data science muscles as well as learn a few things along the way. However, I must admit that if I hadn't gotten accepted into the program it would have been a lot of investment on my part with very little gain (I literally didn't sleep one Friday night coding one of the challenges up - wife was not happy).

If you make it pass the first two rounds, next is your capstone pitch which consists of a stand alone short video of yourself explaining what you want to do for your capstone project as well as a separate video preso further explaining it. It's typically very high level though; some candidates (including yours truly) had alpha/beta-ish projects from other courses as a basis which gave me a clear advantage while others were still in the incubation stage (literally a single page with scribbles on it).

This round is mainly about gauging your personality, how you present in front of a crowd, and how articulate you are when talking about a technical topic. My main advice here would be to practice your pitch and have a few sensible slides to work off of. Please note that you do not get to share your desktop but rather have to send your slides out to everyone over a chatroom which means you can't drive the whole process as you normally would do in a formal presentation.

If all goes well, you're in! Congrats!

## Fellow vs. Scholar

During the admission's process, you can apply to be a Fellow or a Scholar but what does that *really* mean since both are part of the Fellowship program?

Fellows attend TDI tuition free but have to **agree to interview with TDI's partner network for a period of time** before being able to interview with any company of their choosing and have to **attend in-person** and thus can not be online.

Scholars on the other hand have to **pay a tuition fee** but are **not tied to TDI's partner network**. They can also **attend online**. 

However, after the admissions process, everyone is treated as a Fellow, i.e. there is no distinction during and after the program. It's purely an admission distinction only, and in fact the faculty at TDI treat everyone as Fellows - that includes partner meetings, projects, you name it. Again, there is no distinction once you attend.

I attended the program as an Online Fellow since I work a full-tine job and was not going to leave my current job without another one in-hand.

## Online vs In-Person

One aspect about the TDI Fellowship that really stands out is that it was designed to be accessible for online students since its inception. It's one of the major reasons why I applied in the first place and why I think the Insight program is a bit behind the times in this regard.

But that begs the question: Do you loose anything by being an Online Fellow instead of attending In-Person? Yes, there are a few drawbacks:

* It's harder to build a relationship with any of the extremely talented and smart people in your cohort. My advice is if you are near any of TDI offices you should trek in for various events such as Partner Panels mainly in order to mingle with your classmates. That's how I made a few friends.

* Some of the resident data scientists are honestly not as chatty as they should be over Slack. Getting help at times was like pulling teeth and it shouldn't really feel that way.

* Working with the HR folks over Slack can be very painful. For example, an announcement is made for a company you are really interested in but have a few questions not covered by their partner CRM so you quickly direct message the primary contact managing that account hoping to get an answer immediately. Think again. My guess is these folks are uindated with requests all day long and it's just hard for them to be very interactive over chat. Most of the time I would send a direct message and wait at leat 24 hours for a response. My guess is if you were in person it would be easier to interact with these folks and get the information you need faster or at least confirm the person is researching the answer for you. When you are online, you stare at a blank chat window for a while and hope they get back to you. I actually think one BIG improvement would be to treat the CRM kinda like JIRA and have the ability to file Issues in your dashboard (each Issue would be a question that would start a thread). I think this would be much more effective way for everyone involved.

* Attending Partner Panels as an Online Fellow meant very little interactivity with said partner - both during and after the session is over.

* There is no graduation ceremony for Online Fellows. Very minor but definitey something they could easily improve upon. I kinda felt that with the Online folks they should do a final get together to talk a little bit about their experience and do some kind of exit interview as a group.
 
## 12-Day Onboarding Project

Before you start your cohort, TDI has a 12-day onboarding program that you are supposed to work on before you start the class. In fact, there is a [project milestone](https://fast-coast-19766.herokuapp.com) you have to complete before you are admitted which involves building a fairly straightforward web app in Flask. Obviously, this milestone may change over time. So be prepared to start coding on day one.

The 12-day program is a crash course in data structures and algorithms, probability/statistics, and Python. Take it seriously. One of the biggest mistakes many Fellows made was to not to do the self-assigned homework and to work on their day-one milestone late in the game. I'm telling you as someone who knew about 95% of the 12-day program I still needed a refresher on a few things: When is the last time I did any kind of dynamic programming? When is the last time I had to write quicksort from scratch? When is the last time I had to apply Bayes Rule? etc.

## A Day In the Life of a Fellow

Each day the course follows the following outline:

* Coding challenge
* One hour lecture on the topic of the week
* Time to work on the Mini-Project due that week
* Capstone group hours/pitch night discussion (twice a week)
* Job interview lecture (twice a week)
* Office hours (once a week) to discuss any mini-project issues/roadblocks
* Partner Panels (one or two a week after the first month or so)

### Coding Challenges

Every morning you have an hour to do a coding challenge. They are mandatory and vary wildly in quality. Once thing that really bothered me throughout the course was the fact that the coding challenges are somewhat random both in topic and difficulty. I also generally believe that [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems are generally less useful than say [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) which groups coding interview questions by company which is key if you are trying to find a common thread of topics across industries to study (and also somewhat motivating knowing full well that you may see this exact problem in an actual interview). There were many times while struggling on one particular HackerRank ""Hard"" problem where I was like no one (not even Google) is gonna ask me this.

However, I do think they were good practice overall and gets you in the mode of what a job interview could be like. The resident data scientists will go over the solution afterwards; though the reference solutions are sorely lacking in detail and also sometimes ridiculous (i.e. going out of its way to be terse than really explainable).

### Lecture

Every day there is lecture on a particular aspect of a major overarching topic for that week. So one week it maybe on machine learning while another week maybe dedicated to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Since they are only an hour each, it can sometimes feel very overwhelming, or counter intuitively very underwhelming, depending on your existing background on the topic and the course material itself. Most of the material is driven from a bunch of loosely coupled Juptyer notebooks which is good and bad - I found there was absolutely no excuse to have to open up multiple notebooks for an hour long lecture. I think that is just lazy and the notebooks should be re-organized accordingly. But I admit it's a relatively minor grievance in the grand scheme of things.

As for quality, again, it varies a lot. For example, I got a lot out of the Apache Spark and MapReduce lecture series and miniprojects since I have never worked with either of those technologies before and was very eager to learn. However ironically, I didn't get that much out of the machine learning ones since I already knew most of the material.

Overall, I think the lectures were OK. It's just very hard to teach advanced subjects in one hour chunks and it shows.

### Mini-Projects

The mini-projects are nothing short of fantastic! Seriously, if there is one aspect of the program that I think they got right it's this one. They are challenging, realistic, and attempt to really test your understanding of the subject matter they cover. They are also as a result a lot of work and sometimes a bit frustrating too (and this is coming from someone who finished all of them a month early).

Every Satudary that week's mini-project is due. If you fall behind than you loose access to their Partner CRM (see below) until you catch up. One thing they made clear is that this isn't to punish the Fellow. Rather, it's to ensure you understand the underlying course material - and I agree with them. Completing these mini-projects not only gives you a sense of accomplishment but actually makes you feel like a data scientist!

### Capstone

Throughout the course you will be working on [your capstone](https://deepmetal.herokuapp.com/). The capstone can be the one you pitched during the admission process or can be sponsored by a TDI partner. I know what you're thinking: Of course, I'm going to do one sponsored by a TDI partner since that will allow me to get in the door for a interview and land that dream job! Well, yes and no.

I had two online colleagues that did sponsored projects and were treated pretty poorly by their partners. One did a capstone and the partner didn't even show up to watch the person pitch it during Pitch Night (I'm pretty sure they didn't even get an interview to boot). Another was treated fairly well up until they finished the project (they did a fantastic job too) only to find out they weren't really interested in hiring the person full-time. My advice is to research the ""sponsor"" first and try to gauge if there is a post-capstone process in place.

### Job Interview Lectures

These were obviously less useful for me since I have been in the industry for many years and have gone through several interviews in my career. There are few things that I strongly disagreed with that they stressed during the lecture but that's for a another day.

Overall the job presos were presented well and I did learn how to write a proper cover letter (though a few of my more experienced colleagues debated if anyone actually reads them?). I am also very happy with my updated resume.

### Pitch Night

Pitch Night is exactly what it sounds like: Fellows pitch their capstones to a few TDI partners in order to both sell themselves and indirectly the quality of the TDI program. I participated in it and I thought the experience was positive overall. I **did** have the feeling that Pitch Night is more about TDI showing off their product (read: me) more so than about Fellows getting actual job interviews. But to be fair, that might have been more to do with the group of partners that showed up than the actual format of the program itself (read: selection bias).

If you do happen to be one of the lucky souls that gets voted to do Pitch Night, I encourage you to do it. The process is a bit nerve racking but the TDI staff really excelled at making sure you were ready for it.

### Partner Panels

A Partner Panel is where a TDI partner is invited to one of the WeWork office spaces scattered over the country to give some background about their company, how they hire, what's it like to be a data scientist, etc. I found that the quality varied widely - some partners were really prepared and made me want to interview with them. Others, not so much. But even more disappointing was the fact that Online Fellows had practically zero interaction with these folks which put us at a disadvantage. But again, overall I think they were generally positive experiences and I did learn a lot by just listening to partners answer other people's questions.

## Partner Network (CRM)


The ""CRM"" is a SalesForce like website that allows bidirectional communication between Fellows and Partners. Fellows can spam Partners with their CV/resumes and cover letters begging for an interview while Partners can persue Fellow's resumes/CVs and contact them directly.

**The good**: TDI has built a fairly large partner network and it is ever growing. Also TDI's reputation as far as I can tell is pretty good within the industry, e.g. there are some partners who only hire TDI graduates!

**The bad**: The CRM is simply not kept up to date. So there were many, many partners in the CRM that were either listed as inactive or unresponsive. Worse still, there were some partners who were listed as ""active"" who really weren't. Obviously, some of this stuff is out of the control of TDI but it is disheartening to spend hours crafting a cover letter the stuff of legends only to find out the company isn't hiring.

**The ugly**: Do you really have an advantage using their CRM versus applying directly on the partner website? It depends. I believe in general, for smaller companies, you absolutely do have an advantage as a Fellow over a random applicant off the ether since you usually get to talk directly to a hiring manager. For larger companies though, I think you are treated like everyone else as most of the contacts are either someone in HR or a corporate wide recruiter.

## Conclusion/TLDR

TDI is overall a great program and definitely helped me transition into data science. But your results will vary a lot depending on your location, your background, and the number of partners involved in a particular cohort. I think the TDI staff is excellent overall but there are numerous places where they could improve the Fellowship's overall daily flow as well as make it a bit more personal (especially for Online folks).

Finally, I think the Online program is the best bang-for-your-buck as you have the most flexibility with respect to both your time and interview schedule with little to no loss in program content. However, it does incur the cost of not building potentially valuable friendships with your classmates and you are on your own island.

## FAQ

- Can you attend TDI as an Online Fellow while working a full-time job?

You can but it will be difficult. I did the program this way but benefited from the fact that I knew the basics of all the topics being discussed and I already worked from home twice a week. The latter allowed me the flexibility to attend all of the mid-afternoon lectures and participate in my capstone study group. Lectures are usually at noon EST so I could just use my lunch hour to watch them. There were a few Online Fellows who did something similar. Some were successful, some still struggled to balance everything and fell behind (but did eventually complete the program).

But the workload is a lot so be prepared to work long nights and weekends. I lost every night and my entire weekend for a few weeks which can be really tough if you have a family (read: I do).

- Am I guaranteed a DS job if I take this program?

Probably not. Based on talking to a lot of folks who took the program in past cohorts, most were still looking for jobs months after the program ended. Again, it's really the luck of the draw when it comes to the number of partners who are participating and how many of them are actually hiring.

- Ok, but do I have a better chance of landing a job if I'm a TDI graduate?

I would say generally speaking, yes! Particularly if you have no background in DS whatsoever (like yours truly). It gives you an instant network to work with between TDI's existing partner network and your fellow classmates. Moreover, if things go well, you will at least land a few interviews off the bat and get some practice in. All good experiences for landing that first DS job!

- What does the average TDI graduate make?

It varies wildly depending again on your location, your existing experience, and the industry you are working in. You already knew that so this answer is not very satisfying. However, it is the ground truth (literally).

- I heard that partners don't offer as much to TDI graduates since they have to pay TDI a finder's fee?

I forgot where I read this (either here or Quora) but this isn't universally true. There is some truth to it particularly for start-ups where resources are by definition already limited. But for medium to large enterprises, a finder's fee is fairly typical in the industry and has really nothing to do with the position's salary range.

- I got accepted as a Scholar (read: I have to pay) but should I try to reapply as a Fellow instead? And do I have a better chance of landing a job as a Fellow Fellow?

Honestly, if you can afford it, I would advocate that you just take the course. Also, TDI is heavily biased towards having a PhD for the tuition-free Fellowship program so if you only have a Master's degree keep that mind.

As I said earlier, it's not more prestigious - everyone is a Fellow once you are admitted in the eyes of both the staff and perspective employers. It's simply a matter of cost.

- Is there a TDI Alumni network?

Unfortunately, no there isn't. Apparently, this has to do with their partner confidentiality agreements (at least that was my impression). However, a bunch of us from the last cohort started one so if you want to join us just reach out to me directly.

Hope this helps someone,

* I am a 21 year old undergrad that is graduating December 2019
* Double major in Economics/Political Science (B.A.)
* I have mild experience with Python and extremely beginner experience in R

&amp;#x200B;

So, the reason I call this my first real data analysis internship is because I had studied abroad in London for a couple months and during that time I worked at a health partnership doing data analysis for about 8 weeks. While it was extremely introductory and the other half of my position was more on the programming aspect over data analysis, I still learned a lot about the work of it and it seriously interests me as a future career. Most of my work was in python and creating graphics to help visualize data using various info-graphic creators(E.g. Piktochart)

&amp;#x200B;

So in early June of this year I'll be starting a position in the streaming music industry working with advertisement data and demographics effectiveness. Also, I was told during the interview I would be looking at AB testing as well as multi-variate testing and kind of taking a bit of a lead on this so I have some discretion on how I want to go about this. What are some things I should learn/practice to help me prepare as much as possible? I am hoping this internship will pan out to a full-time position after I graduate so any help at all will be extremely helpful.

* EECS 280 (4 credits): Programming and Elementary Data Structures.
* EECS 281 (4 credits): Data Structures and Algorithms.
* STATS 412 (3 credits): Introduction to Probability and Statistics.
* STATS 413 (4 credits): Applied Regression Analysis (F16)
* Math 214 or 217 (4 credits): Linear algebra
* Machine learning and data mining elective: EECS 445 or STATS 415. Note that credit is granted for only one of these courses.
* Data management and applications elective: EECS 484 or EECS 485.
* Electives of my choice - related to modeling, ML, AI, etc.

Hi all,

So this past Tuesday, my college held a meet and greet/information session for data scientist positions at a notable asset management firm. I've been wanting to work for this company for the longest time so of course I went.

About six months prior I happened to connect with a Senior Recruiting/Hiring Manager from the company through Linkedin. He was nice enough to give me his email and contact information, so I have been communicating with him on and off for the past 6 months. Now, I went to the meet and greet session expecting there to be a few recruiters there and it turned out that the guy I had been keeping in contact with was there and everything seemed to go really well between him and myself. I was able to introduce myself in person, hand him a resume and show him how serious I was about working with them. After we were done talking he told me to stay in contact with him, so it appears to me that he would be willing to eventually help me get into the company. (Idk though, maybe I'm being naive)

Anyways...my question is, how should I go about emailing him and what steps should I take next? I don't want to appear too pushy but I want him to realize that I'm very serious about pursuing a career in data science with their company.

Sorry for asking such a newbie question, I'm just really new to all of this.

I'm planning to implement the following but would like to hear if this will give the result I'm looking for or if there are flaws in my approach. 

I have a dataset of around 20000 records with 60 variables. I'm looking to cluster the data and to eventually come away with an understanding of the similarity between the record. 

A simple approach is to :

1. Run a clustering algorithm 
2. Run a model on the output of the cluster and see which variables contribute most to each cluster. 

I want to extend the above by :

1. Performing clustering within a loop. Each loop takes a random subset of the available variables and creates clusters based on just those variables. 
2. Create a model to determine the variable importance within iteration of the loop. 
3. Consolidate the output of each of those iterations and then determine the co-occurence of each record with each of the other records. The more time two records co-occur, the greater their similarity. 

I would then want to use the output of steps 3 above and present this as a large network graph so that I can manually determine the clusters. This visualization should be the final presentation of the data.

I don't mean libraries and stuff like that but the development tools and how you use them.

Currently I use a Jupyter notebook in PyCharm in a REPL-like fashion and as a software engineer I am very underwhelmed with the development experience. There has to be a better way. In the notebook, I first import all my CSV-data into a pandas dataframe and then put each ""step"" of the data preparation process into its own cell. This quickly gets very annoying when you have to insert print statements everywhere, selectively rerun or skip earlier cells to try out something new and so on. In PyCharm there is no REPL in the same context as the notebook, no preview pane for plots from the REPL, no usable dataframe inspector like you have in RStudio. It's a very painful experience. 

Another problem is the disconnect between experimenting and putting the code into production. One option would be to sample a subset of the data (since pandas is so god damn slow) for the notebook, develop the data preparation code there and then only paste the relevant parts into another python file that can be used in production. You can then either throw away the notebook or keep it in version control. In the former case, you lose all the debugging code: If you ever want to make changes to the production code, you have to write all your sampling, printing and plotting code from the lost notebook again (since you can only reasonably test and experiment in the notebook). In the latter case, you have immense code duplication and will have trouble keeping the notebook and production code in-sync. There may also be issues with merging the notebooks if multiple people work on it at once. 

After the data preparation is done, you're going to want to test out different models to solve your business problem. Do you keep those experiments in different branches forever or do you merge everything back into master, even models that weren't very successful? In case you merge them, intermediate data might accumulate and make checking out revisions very slow. How do you save reports about the model's performance?",54,48,False,self,,,,,

For example a MSDS has no courses in data structures and algorithms, and only graze aspects of software development. Many of the stats courses dont really teach any thing higher than stats many have already learned in a year long stats and prob sequence, just in the context of big data.

So I wonder if a MSCS that focuses on machine learning would actually be even more competitive. Specific tools like Hardoop and Spark can be learned on eDx.org or during an internship.

#Introduction

Hello, my name is Alexander and I'm a recent graduate of [The Data Incubator](http://thedataincubator.com) program.

I know before I joined the program [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) was an invaluable tool in helping me make my final decision to attend (a big shout out to all members who responded to my private messages) and this in-depth (read: way too long - I mean for peet's sake it has a [TOC](#toc)) review is my small attempt to give back. I also believe that my perspective is somewhat unique in that most of the existing great reviews out there are from a fresh grad/post-doc perspective while mine is one from someone who is already an  experienced professional looking to transition into data science.

&lt;span id=""aboutme""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#About Me

I'm formerly trained in computer science and have been a [Senior Software Engineer]((https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandersack314/)) for over 15 years. I started my career with a deep love of operating systems and UNIX (I'm getting old, I remember installing RedHat from a dozen or so floppy disks) so the first half of my career has been spent writing fairly low-level/high performant (well, sometimes) code mainly in C/C++. So think storage and network drivers, boot code, deep packet inspection, and just general platform work.

However in 2016, I read [""The Great A.I. Awakening"" in the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html) and was completely blown away by it. The only time I have ever heard of anything related to neural networks was the venerable perceptron algorithm which I knew was [used on some CPUs for branch prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/903263). But I had no idea how far the AI community had come with deep learning and vowed that I wanted to be part of the action! Since then I've taken numerous online MOOCs on machine learning and now consider [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) to be one of my closest friends (disclaimer: I have never met Professor Ng).

&lt;span id=""tdi""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#The Data Incubator (TDI)

If you aren't familiar with [TDI's Fellowship program](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html), it is considered by many to be one of the premier data science bootcamps in the country (US anyway). It is an eight week program that is supposed to not only teach you the foundations of data science but also help you land a job as well through their every expanding partner network. Their main competitor is probably [Insight](https://www.insightdatascience.com) but they are also battling an entire cottage industry multi-week camps such as [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/) and [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com) to name a few.

&lt;span id=""admissions""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##Admissions

What's makes TDI somewhat unique compared to other bootcamps is that their is a non-trivial admission process which is broken down into three rounds:

* Resume/CV Review
* Project Challenge
* Capstone Pitch

My guess is the majority of folks get past the first round provided you have a graduate degree from a [reputable university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO1061QisVs) but get rejected in the second round during the project challenge phase. They claim their acceptance rate is 2-3% which is about right: My cohort I think had ~4k applicants with a little less than 36 attending.

The project challenge is actually broken down into two or three subprojects with each subproject covering areas of probability, statistics, and basic data science (mostly dataset handling and EDA, not modeling). I would say knowledge of Python is pretty much required to get through the challenges intact.

This is how it works: TDI will send you a link to a real, midsized dataset (at least a few gigabytes) and ask you to perform some in-depth EDA about it. For the stats/probs part, they will ask you to write some code to simulate an experiment and then ask various basic probability questions about your results. So I would say if you are looking to ""book-up"" for the admissions process you should be fairly comfortable with Python, pandas/numpy, web scraping, and SQL. Obviously, challenge questions will vary with each cohort but my guess is they are all similar with respect to the skillsets you need to do them. You have a few days to finish it and can submit as many times as you want, i.e. you can work on some, submit, work on another part, submit, redo the first section, submit, etc.

I talked to several classmates about the challenge project and I think on average most folks said they spent at least 20 hours working on it - so be prepared. The admission process says it takes a few hours to finish but that is just not realistic unless you happen to be not only fluent in the above technologies (I was) but also familiar with the dataset in question (obvioulsy not).

Frankly, I found all the challenge problems to be a lot of fun! I got to not only flex my data science muscles but also learn a few things along the way. However, I must admit that if I hadn't gotten accepted into the program it would have been a heavy investment on my part with very little gain (I literally didn't sleep one Friday night coding one of the challenges up, read: the wife was not happy).

If you make it pass the first two rounds, next is your capstone pitch which consists of a stand alone short video of yourself explaining what you want to do for your capstone project as well as a separate video preso further explaining it. It's typically very high level though; some candidates (including yours truly) had alpha/beta-ish projects from other courses as a basis which gave us a clear advantage while others were still in the incubation stage (literally a single page with scribbles on it that vaguely resembled ""Look out, Data Science!"").

Note that this round is mainly about gauging your personality, how you present in front of a crowd under a time crunch, and how articulate you are when talking about a technical topic. My main advice here would be to practice your pitch and have a few sensible slides to work off of. Please note that you do not get to share your desktop but rather have to send your slides to everyone over a chatroom, which means you can't drive the whole process as you normally would in a formal presentation.

If all goes well, you're in! Congrats!

&lt;span id=""fellowvsscholar""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##Fellow vs. Scholar

During the admission's process, you can apply to be a Fellow or a Scholar but what does that *really* mean since both are part of the Fellowship program?

Fellows attend TDI tuition free but have to **agree to interview with TDI's partner network for a period of time** before being able to interview with any company of their choosing and have to **attend in-person** and thus can not be online.

Scholars on the other hand have to **pay a tuition fee** but are **not tied to TDI's partner network**. They can also **attend online** and are **eligible for a 50% refund if they land a job with a partner**.

However, after the admissions process, everyone is treated as a Fellow, i.e. there is no distinction during and after the program. It's purely an admission distinction only, and in fact the faculty at TDI treat everyone as Fellows - that includes partner meetings, projects, you name it. Again, there is no distinction once you start the program.

I attended the program as an Online Fellow since I work full-time and was not going to leave my current job without another one in-hand.

&lt;span id=""onlinevsinperson""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##Online vs In-Person

One aspect about the TDI Fellowship that really stands out is that it was designed to be accessible for online students since its inception. It's one of the major reasons why I applied in the first place and why I think the Insight program is a bit behind the times in this regard.

But that begs the question: Do you loose anything by being an Online Fellow instead of attending In-Person? Yes, there are a few drawbacks:

* It's harder to build a relationship with any of the extremely talented and smart people in your cohort. My advice is if you are near any of TDI offices you should trek in for various events such as Partner Panels mainly in order to mingle with your classmates. That's how I made a few friends!

* Some of the resident data scientists are honestly not as chatty as they should be over Slack. Getting help at times was like pulling teeth and it shouldn't really feel that way. Obviously, your mileage may vary, but that's how I felt throughout the course minus our capstone group leader who was awesome.

* Working with the HR folks over Slack can be very painful. For example, an announcement is made for a company you are really interested in interviewing with but have a few basic questions not covered by the [CRM](#crm) so you quickly direct message the primary contact managing that account hoping to get an answer immediately. Think again. My guess is these folks are uindated with requests all day long and it's just hard for them to be very interactive over chat. Most of the time I would send a direct message and wait at leat 24 hours for a response. My guess is if you were in person it would be easier to interact with these folks and get the information you need faster or at least confirm the person is researching the answer for you. When you are online, you stare at a blank chat window for a while and hope they get back to you. I actually think one big improvement would be to treat the [CRM](#crm) kinda like [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and have the ability to file Issues in your dashboard (each Issue would be a question that would start a thread). I think this would be much more effective way for everyone involved.

* Attending [Partner Panels](#panels) as an Online Fellow meant very little interactivity with said partner - both during and after the session is over.

* There is no graduation ceremony for Online Fellows. Very minor but definitey something they could easily improve upon. I kinda felt that with the Online folks they should do a final get together to talk a little bit about their experience and do some kind of exit interview as a group.
 
&lt;span id=""onboarding""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##Onboarding

Before you officially start your cohort, TDI has a 12-day onboarding program that they recommend you work on as well as **a homework project that you must complete and submit before attending class**. So be prepared to start coding on day one after accepting the Fellowship.

The 12-day program is a crash course in data structures and algorithms, probability/statistics, and Python. Take it seriously. One of the biggest mistakes many Fellows made was to not to do go through the 12-day program in earnest and to work on their day-one homework assignment late in the game. I'm telling you as someone who knew about 95% of the 12-day program that I still needed a refresher on a few things: When is the last time you did any kind of dynamic programming? When is the last time you had to write quicksort from scratch? You get the idea.

&lt;span id=""dayfellow""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##A Day In the Life of a Fellow

Each day the course follows the following outline:

* Coding challenge
* One hour lecture on the topic of the week
* Time to work on the Mini-Project due that week
* Capstone group hours/pitch night discussion (twice a week)
* Job interview lecture (twice a week)
* Office hours (once a week) to discuss any mini-project issues/roadblocks
* Partner Panels (one or two a week after the first month or so)

&lt;span id=""codingchallenges""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
###Coding Challenges

Every morning you have an hour to do a coding challenge. They are mandatory and vary wildly in quality. Once thing that really bothered me throughout the course was the fact that the coding challenges are somewhat random both in topic and difficulty. I also generally believe that [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems are generally less useful than say [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) which groups coding interview questions by company which is key if you are trying to find a common thread of topics across industries to study (and also somewhat motivating knowing full well that you may see that exact problem in an actual interview). There were many times while struggling on one particular HackerRank ""Hard"" problem where I was like no one (not even Google) is gonna ask me this.

The resident data scientists will go over the solution afterwards; though the reference solutions are sorely lacking in detail and occasionally flat out ridiculous, i.e. the solution will focus on brevity instead of explainability. But overall, I do think the coding challenges were good practice and gets you in the mode of what a job interview could be like. 

&lt;span id=""lectures""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
###Lectures

Every day there is lecture on a particular aspect of a major overarching topic for that week. So one week it maybe on machine learning while another week maybe dedicated to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Since they are only an hour each, it can sometimes feel very overwhelming, or counter intuitively very underwhelming, depending on your existing background on the topic and the course material itself. Most of the material is driven from a bunch of loosely coupled Juptyer notebooks which is good and bad - I found there was absolutely no excuse to have to open up multiple notebooks for an hour long lecture. I think that is just lazy and the notebooks should be re-organized accordingly. But I admit it's a relatively minor grievance in the grand scheme of things.

As for quality, again, it varies a lot. For example, I got a lot out of the Apache Spark and MapReduce lecture series and miniprojects since I have never worked with either of those technologies before and was very eager to learn. However ironically, I didn't get that much out of the machine learning ones since I already knew most of the material.

Overall, I think the lectures were OK. It's just very hard to teach advanced subjects in one hour chunks and it shows.

&lt;span id=""miniprojects""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
###Mini-Projects

The mini-projects are nothing short of fantastic! Seriously, if there is one aspect of the program that I think they got right it's this one. They are challenging, realistic, and attempt to really test your understanding of the subject matter they cover. They are also as a result a lot of work and sometimes a bit frustrating too (and this is coming from someone who finished all of them a month early).

Every Satudary that week's mini-project is due and is auto-graded on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale. You need to get a 0.9 or higher on every mini-project to graduate the program. If you fall behind than you loose access to the [CRM](#crm) until you catch up. One thing they made clear is that this isn't to punish the Fellow. Rather, it's to ensure you understand the underlying course material - and I agree with them. Completing these mini-projects not only gives you a sense of accomplishment but actually makes you feel like a data scientist!

&lt;span id=""capstone""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
###Capstone

Throughout the course you will be working on [your capstone](https://deepmetal.herokuapp.com/). The capstone can be the one you pitched during the admission process or can be sponsored by a TDI partner. I know what you're thinking: Of course, I'm going to do one sponsored by a TDI partner since that will allow me to get in the door for a interview and land that dream job! Well, yes and no.

I had two online colleagues that did sponsored projects and were treated pretty poorly by their partners. One person finished the capstone and the partner didn't even show up to watch the person pitch it during [Pitch Night](#pitchnight) (I'm pretty sure they didn't even get an interview to boot). Ironically, another was treated fairly well up until he actually finished the project (he did a fantastic job too) only to find out that his partner wasn't really interested in hiring him full-time. My advice is to research the ""sponsor"" first and try to gauge if there is a post-capstone process in place.

In general though, I would pick a capstone you feel somewhat passionate about - either in its subject matter or its methodology. Remember, this project is mainly for you in that it gives you something to talk about in an interview when asked what kind of DS have you done outside of saving passengers on the Titanic (drum roll please)!

&lt;span id=""joblectures""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
###Job Interview Lectures

These were obviously less useful for me since I have been in the industry for many years and have gone through several interviews in my career. There are few things that I strongly disagreed with that they stressed during the lecture (outside of maybe finance I would never ever wear a suit and tie to an interview - not happening) but that's for a another day.

Overall the job presos were presented well and I did learn how to write a proper cover letter (though a few of my more experienced colleagues debated if anyone actually reads them?). I am also very happy with my updated resume.

&lt;span id=""pitchnight""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
###Pitch Night

Pitch Night is exactly what it sounds like: Fellows pitch their capstones to a few TDI partners in order to both sell themselves and indirectly the quality of the TDI program. I participated in it and I thought the experience was positive overall. I **did** have the feeling that Pitch Night is more about TDI showing off their product (read: me) more so than about Fellows getting actual job interviews. But to be fair, that might have been more to do with the group of partners that showed up than the actual format of the program itself (read: selection bias).

If you do happen to be one of the lucky souls that gets voted to do Pitch Night, I encourage you to do it. The process is a bit nerve racking but the TDI staff really excelled at making sure you were ready for it.

&lt;span id=""panels""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
###Partner Panels

A Partner Panel is where a TDI partner is invited to one of the WeWork office spaces scattered over the country to give some background about their company, how they hire, what's it like to be a data scientist, etc. Usually, an in-person Fellow is the panel ""lead"" and is responsible for introducing the partner and asking the first set of questions.

I found that the quality varied widely - some partners were really prepared and made me want to interview with them. Others, not so much. But even more disappointing was the fact that Online Fellows had practically zero interaction with these folks which put us at a disadvantage. I also think that this process could be improved a lot by formalizing the partner side more, i.e. require them to follow a certain format and answer a few standard questions right out the bat. But overall I think they were generally positive experiences and I did learn a lot by just listening to partners answer other people's questions. 

&lt;span id=""crm""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##The ""CRM""

TDI's partner network is encapsulated by their internal [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-relationship_management) website that allows bidirectional communication between Fellows and Partners. Fellows can spam Partners with their CV/resumes and cover letters begging for an interview while Partners can peruse Fellow's resumes/CVs and contact them directly.

**The good**: TDI has built a fairly large partner network and it is ever growing. Also TDI's reputation as far as I can tell is pretty good within the industry, e.g. there are some partners who only hire TDI graduates believe it or not!

**The bad**: The CRM is simply not kept up to date. So there were many, many partners in the CRM that were either listed as inactive or unresponsive. Worse still, there were some partners who were listed as ""active"" who really weren't. Obviously, some of this stuff is out of TDI's control but it is disheartening to spend hours crafting a cover letter the stuff of legends only to find out the company isn't hiring.

**The ugly**: The site iself I found pretty awful in layout and design. Seriously, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is their friend. I also thought even simple things are missing like complete descriptions about the what the company does, have they hired TDI fellows before, and any interviewing tips you should know (you can ask for this but I think it should just be baked into the CRM as a free service for Fellows).

&lt;span id=""tldr""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##Conclusion/TLDR

TDI is overall a good program and definitely helped me transition into data science. But your results will vary a lot depending on your location, your background, and the number of partners involved in a particular cohort. I think the TDI staff is excellent overall but there are numerous places where they could improve the Fellowship's overall daily flow as well as make it a bit more personal (especially for Online folks).

&lt;span id=""faq""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
##FAQ

- Can you attend TDI as an Online Fellow while working a full-time job?

You can but it will be difficult. I did the program this way but benefited from the fact that I knew the basics of all the topics being discussed and I already worked from home twice a week. The latter allowed me the flexibility to attend all of the mid-afternoon lectures and participate in my capstone study group. Lectures are usually at noon EST so I could just use my lunch hour to watch them. There were a few Online Fellows who did somthing similar. Some were successful, some still struggled to balance everything and fell behind (but did evenutally complete the program).

But the workload is a lot so be prepared to work long nights and weekends. I lost every night and my entire weekend for a few weeks which can be really tough if you have a family (read: I do).

- Am I guaranteed a DS job if I take this program?

Probably not. Based on talking to a lot of folks who took the program in past cohorts, most were still looking for jobs months after the program ended. Again, it's really the luck of the draw when it comes to the number of partners who are participating and how many of them are actually hiring.

- Ok, but do I have a better chance of landing a job if I'm a TDI graduate?

I would say generally speaking, yes! Particularly if you have no background in DS whatsoever (like yours truly). It gives you an instant network to work with between TDI's and your fellow classmates. Moreover, if things go well, you will at least land a few interviews off the bat and get some practice in. All good experiences for landing that first DS job!

- Do you really have an advantage using their CRM versus applying directly on the partner website?

It depends. I believe in general, for smaller companies, you absolutely do have an advantage as a Fellow over a random applicant off the ether since you usually get to talk directly to a hiring manager. For larger companies though, I think you are treated like everyone else as most of the contacts are either someone in HR or a corporate wide recruiter.

- What does the average TDI graduate make?

It varies wildly depending again on your location, your existing experience, and the industry you are working in. You already knew that so this answer is not going to be very satisfying. However, it is the ground truth (literally).

- I heard that parters don't offer as much to TDI graduates since they have to pay TDI a finder's fee?

I forgot where I read this (either here or Quora) but this isn't universally true. There is some truth to it particularly for start-ups and small outfits where resources are by definition limited. But for medium to large enterprises, a finder's fee is fairly typical in the industry and has really noting to do with a certain position's salary range.

- I got accepted as a Scholar. Should I try to reapply as a Fellow instead? And do I have a better chance of landing a job as a Fellow vs. a Scholar?

Honestly, if you can afford it, I would advocate that you just take the course. Also, TDI is heavily biased towards having a PhD for the tuition-free Fellowship program so if you only have a Master's degree keep that mind.

As I said earlier, it's not more prestigious - everyone is a Fellow once you are admitted in the eyes of both the staff and perspective employers. It's simply a matter of cost.

- Is there a TDI Alumni network?

Unfortunately, no there isn't. Apparently, this has to do with their partner confidentiality agreements (at least that was my impression after inquiring).

Hi. I'm working as deep learning engineer.

I'm interested in starting a startup company which deals with big data driven medicine project.

Strong computing power and big data are new paradigm resources that we can use in this era.

So, I think methodology using them probably can be paradigm shift and game changer.

For example, there are research papers that say eating 3 eggs in a week is good for the health, and there are research papers that say eating 3 eggs in a week is harm for the health. There can be various reasons that this paradoxical situation happens.

As all other people think, I also just think using strong computing power and big data can help that paradoxical situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**- What I would like to do:**

I'm interested in genomics, cancer, better treatment/diagnosis, new drug discovery, etc.

And I'm also interested in better A.I. like AGI (artificial general intelligence) which is enhanced in its systemic architecture by mimicking neuroscience mechanism as a long-term goal which is valuable goal itself worth to pursue as well as the supporting technique that can help short-term medicine challenge goals.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **What I'm looking for:**

For the first, I'm looking for data scientist, machine learning engineer who can start open data science competitions like from Kaggle.

And if we can make good working, I would like to launch a startup together.

&amp;#x200B;

I just read an article on applying ML to optimizing landing pages for advertising campaigns, and the thought I'd like to confirm is that a company with years of data from running a page-builder has an insurmountable lead that a non-proprietary alternative would never be able to catch up to (for lack of training data). That's an example, I've run into the though often enough to ask if there are possibilities I don't see for finding data (and where to ask it - if this is the right place).",10,3,False,self,,,,,

I wrote [an article about OpenAI's GPT-2 language model](https://blog.floydhub.com/gpt2/), which recently got published on [the FloydHub blog](https://blog.floydhub.com/). In it, I explain most of the NLP breakthroughs that led to the creation of what media outlets are referring to as ""the AI that's too dangerous to release."" You can read the article [here](https://blog.floydhub.com/gpt2/).

&amp;#x200B;

Like in my [previous article](https://blog.nanonets.com/hyperparameter-optimization/), I included a jupyter notebook that can be run with just a few clicks, so that you see an actual, live, demo running in real time. The demo includes a pretrained GPT-2 ([courtesy of hugging face](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT)) that can generate text based on a prompt that you provide.

&amp;#x200B;

I've stayed away from any opinions on the decision not to release the full model since I feel that there's been plenty of that on twitter already. Here, I aim to provide a clear and straightforward explanation of how exactly the algorithm works, so that you can make your own informed decisions.

I am not a data scientist nor a statistician so please bear with my limited knowledge of the subject.
I was looking for linear regression in Python for a simple predictive model. All the links lead to scikit-learn's builtin regression model.

Does that mean under the hood sci kit learn also performs similar calculations or is it training the model in a different way?",4,1,False,self,,,,,

I am able to get the table into Pandas DataFrame format using a library called Camelot. However I am confused what I can do after this in order to get structured data when different authors have used different schemas for their table (axis names, date formats, sometimes even the x and y axis are flipped).

I have lots of experience doing this with plain text in English e.g. if I want to get prices out of a document I could use named entity recognition and manually tag some examples. But tables are another layer of complexity. Has anyone done this before and do you know of any libraries or papers on the topic?

Deep in Deep Learning is elusive yet  approachable with a bit of  mathematics. This beckons a practical  question: Is elementary calculus  sufficient to unravel deep learning?  The answer is yes indeed, with an unbound curiosity to learn and  re-learn new and old alike and  possibly if you can follow methodically, I reckon youll  cross the chasm to intuitively  understand and apply every concepts  including calculus in their glory  to de-clutter all intricacies  of deep  learning.  Im covering the  steps I took and what I researched, read and understood   being  captured to reveal each concept as intuitively as possible and  additional topics that piques your interest:
