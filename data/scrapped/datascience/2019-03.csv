- Text expansion, if you went crazy with this then there would likely be a huge learning curve.  
- Using a typed shorthand system like [keyscript](http://keyscript.wikifoundry-mobile.com/m/page/Alpha+Shorthand+Systems), then decode it with some ML system, although I'd imagine that this would have a lot of challenges.

I asked them why they felt I needed further development, and their response was that I should know how to sell our product and services so that I could give presentations to clients. I told them I have no interest in learning how to be a salesman, attending sales meetings, or being involved with the sales side of the business.

He said I look great on paper and we got an interview set up this Monday.

It is only a temp position (6 months) and they are going to pay me $16/hour with 40 hour work weeks. The pay is not where I would want it to be but since I am having a hard time finding work without any relevant internship experience, but I think this temp job would fill that void.

I am not quite sure what to expect from this position other than I will be working a lot with excel.

I am already comfortable working in python and have some independent projects. I just don't know how important the excel skills will be since R and python seem more important. I think working at a big company like citadel would look nice on my resume, and maybe I can get an offer already being on the inside, but I am just a little worried it might be a dead end job just entering numbers into excel spreadsheets and at the end I will be in a similar situation to what I am in now.

But they are put together during JIT compilation when in Python packages are put together during interpretation. So there is less bottlenecks and it's actually much more convenient to combine math algorithm this way.

The convenience matters a lot.

So I'm curious if I understood the main idea right and is there a really big deal about combining this way instead of another? If so then why there is no Numba specific packages ecosystem in development that can also be combined JIT compilation way?

Dear friends,

So I've recently been accepted to two programs:

[University of Chicago Masters Program in Computer Science](https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/page/mpcs-course-catalog-0)

[Carnegie Mellon University Masters in Statistical Practice](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/msp/curriculum)

&amp;#x200B;

My career goal is to utilize data to predict credit risk in the finance realm, but I am also opened to other competitive opportunities in the tech industry that creates value from data science.

Having been a finance major as an undergraduate, both programs will allow me to step into the ""quantitative"" realm and provide a distinct skill set from finance. I do however have trouble selecting a program that is more appropriate for me. The curriculum for the two are linked above.

&amp;#x200B;

**Carnegie Mellon**

* Teaches a lot of relevant programming languages for data science (Python, R, SAS (finance industry), SQL, Hadoop, Spark)
* Carnegie Mellon is a great department for statistics, along with its extraordinary computer science / machine learning departments. However, I am not sure if this ""particular"" program is as strong.
* A bit cheaper, but not by much.
* An applied statistics program, but perhaps a little ""too"" few statistical theory in the program (both an pro and a con).
* Great [employment statistic](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/msp/alumnidestinations)s post graduation, but seems to be mostly small-mid sized tech/healthcare firms. Do not see too much employment into the finance industry or larger tech giants compared to other statistics/ computer science/ data science masters programs. Which brings me to the point, again, is this ""particular"" program strong?

&amp;#x200B;

**University of Chicago (Specialization in Data Analytics Courses)**

* Teaches other useful languages such as Java and C and focuses primarily on Python. Not too much, if any, exposure to other languages such as R. Do see some exposure to stuff like Hadoop and Spark though, and a lot more expertise into Python.
* U of Chicago is a great university and it is investing a lot into its computer science department. As of current though, the department is definitely nowhere near the top at least in the application side.
* A bit more expensive, but Chicago.
* Seems like a well organized program and welcomes people with limited programming/computer science backgrounds. A lot of useful classes to note (machine learning, NLP, and personal opinion: good mix of stats courses in the program)
* Not too certain of post graduate employment statistics. However, I noticed most alumni go into software engineering/development roles, not in data science. Not sure if that is because the data analytics courses are relatively new.

I was great in math in high school, earning college credits in calculus, physics and chemistry. But I wanted to study history and polysci, so I did that at a great university. 

I worked in marketing out of college, got a masters in business, and kept getting more into stats and tech in marketing, albeit slowly. I also learned SQL, digital analytics, Tableau, etc. Thats over 18 yrs, but just kind of picking away at the whole data analytics area.

A couple years ago I learned python on the side, and it has opened up a whole new world for me. Finally, I made the jump to doing pure analytics last year. I feel Ive done data science-y stuff, but Im still filling in the gaps - trying to go from being a hack to being a proper data scientist. I can run a machine learning algorithm and kind of sort of explain whats going on under the hood. Ive also worked at building profiles on people from millions of rows of transactional data - the algorithm I coded is pretty cool, but the stats used are somewhat elementary  like pd.cut or grabbing max by various segmentations. 

I make good money doing what I do - I just turned down a $125k offer, mainly because it was more suped up analysis rather than proper predictive analytics/machine learning.

Im reading Oreilly books on stats/pandas to be able to do things right. And Im taking Coursera courses on linear algebra/multi variable calc.

Where I lack in technical/stats skills, I believe I make up for in terms of communicating and solving actual business problems with data. Which is (I assume) why people want to pay me well. I mean, being older helps there too :-)

My question - does it make sense to do a masters in data science? And if so, does doing it at a top school like UC Berkeley ($60k) give you a lot more than a more reasonably priced option like UC San Diego ($15k)?

I mean, I see data science salaries mentioned from $90k - $400k. I suppose if a degree allowed me to keep doing what I loved and jumped up from $125k to $160k, itd be worth the higher-end price tag. But is that how it works? Or better to just learn more data science on the side and keep hacking this shit together?

Thanks for your thoughts.

When we were working through a problem, I got stumped by what I would have called a simple problem otherwise. While there could be many approaches to solving this problem, I am laying out the prompt and what I think now is a good answer in some detail. If you have any suggestions for improvements or alternate solutions, please let me know

Prompt- A home goods company has about 100,000 different categories of items being sold online at any given time. Every week a different 1000 of those items are put on sale (have a label on their website indicating they are on sale), and the company wishes to find out the quantitative effect of having items on sale. How do we go about finding this answer?

My answer: Multiple Linear regression and finding the coefficient of a (binary) On sale feature. Outlining the steps:

 Set up a dataframe where each row indicates information for 1 item over a week

 The output/y of each row would be the Number of sales that week 

 Include the data for the whole year SO each item will have 52 rows of information representing it, where each row output represents the number of Sales that week. I suggested looking at data over a year to account for seasonal effects and to include data on how the items that are on sale on a week perform for the other 51 weeks when they are not on sale

 Have a On sale feature with a binary 1/0 value indicating whether the item is on sale that week

 The other features could be all kinds of other possible information on that item- listed price, how long the item has been on the market,  if its a home-good for kids(yes/no), if its a luxury item(yes/no) furniture type (could be split up into multiple binary features indicating aspects like Patio furniture (yes/no), chair (yes/no), bed(yes/no) etc etc

 Fit a multiple linear regression model over the entire data-set of 5,200,000 datapoints (52 weeks \*100,000 items) that best predicts the number of sales that week for any item on any week

 Find the coefficient of the On sale feature. This coefficient would indicate the change in sale-output for an average item on an average week

My questions regarding my solution:

1) Does this sound like a good, relatively simple approach to inferring the effect of having items on sale?

2) Are there any other simple models that would potentially work better? I understand that more complex non-linear algorithms could provide better predictions/inferences given the huge data-set, but I am trying to set up an algorithm thats relatively low-cost

3) If certain complex cost-heavy algorithms would work better than the others, what would those be?

4) For a problem like this, would there be a big advantage advantage to looking at sales per day or per hour, as opposed to per week? I take that if each row represents Number of sales per hour then I will also have to add features that indicate hour of the day, day of the week etc.

5) Any other suggestions in general to construct a better model for this data?

I am looking forward to hearing the thoughts of other statisticians on this. Thank you",56,55,False,self,,,,,

She also briefly mentioned the fact that, in the past, they've hired 'proper'/qualified data analysts, but they were unhappy with their performance, so essentially it looks like *they want someone who is easy to mold to the company's needs*. 

The interview tomorrow will be with her--the president--and some people from the technical team. I've been spending the day reading about this field, but I still feel completely unprepared.

I have been teaching myself programming and data science for about 8 months now. I have a background in biology (graduated in 2008) and went to med school for 6 yrs before calling it quit due to high stress level and academic struggles. Later, I started my own company and sold it recently. I am looking to switch careers. I am pretty comfortable with math. I understand what needs to be done. Now, I've been applying and looking for entry level positions as a data analyst, python programmer, or junior data scientist. Now, I know I don't have lot of job experience because I've been in med school for a long time and recently switched career from being an entrepreneur to doing programming and IoT which I enjoy them a lot.   


I plan to revised my resume to add more projects, but I was hoping if you can tell me what I am doing wrong and why I am getting lot of emails from company that thinks I am not the best fit for any entry level position as a data analyst or junior data scientist.   


I just want to get my foot in the door at some entry level or temporary/contract data science jobs.   


On my resume, I have two jobs (one from my parents' family restaurant which I've helped and run for more than 20 yrs. since 5th grade) and other was a small start-up business which I build it up from scratch and later sold the business for a profit. That's it.   


Rest of the skills were from my previous jobs but they are more business-y. I have beginner skills in Git, Python, SQL, Data munging, data acquisition, Statistical modeling, tableau/powerbi/, pyspark, data structure &amp; algorithm.   


I would say I am comfortable right now doing EDA and data munging along with data viz. I don't have any masters or phd's. but I plan to get my masters in near future after landing a stable job.   


What should I do? Should I remove my job experiences and add more projects to my resume?   


I already have a website which i've learned html/css/js for that purpose. I am not into webdev after going through that hassle of making a website (lol, props to webdevs out there).

Unfortunately it's not that popular question. Sometimes it turns into \[Cython/Numba/C/C++ battles\]([https://github.com/pydata/sparse/issues/126](https://github.com/pydata/sparse/issues/126)).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a discussion of this issue: \[Why Julia? Will Python/Numba and Python/Cython lose to Julia?\]([https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3814](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3814)). And I cannot foresee any solution to this disarray except maybe \[interop at the C level\]([https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/cfunc.html#example](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/cfunc.html#example)). If there would be a PEP specification for such API then it would be even better. But I guess the solution to this should be as pythonic as possible (mentioned Numba tools to create C functions in a pythonic way are really good).

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm not sure how scalable is interop at the C level approach (it's merely my lack of knowledge). Can there be compositions of compositions?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Python to Julia transpiler

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast to Python Julia language doesn't suffer from lack of unified API and it constantly enriches packages ecosystem that can be easily combined. Now it even has a stable release. This actually brings another possibility to fix the problem mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be nice to have Transpiler from subset of Python with special module named like ""Juthon"" to feature-complete subset of Julia (sometimes there are more than one way to do something in Julia).

&amp;#x200B;

And a idea looks like it should both be:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Standalone transpiler so that the user can write ""Juthon"" package and contribute it to the Julia ecosystem by transpiling.

2. Runtime decorator style transpiler (with interface like Numba has) that calls Julia (or compiled python library in the future) from Python. So that a small piece of code can be added right in the Python app written in Python.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if 2. possible though... If not then something like \[enaml import\]([https://github.com/nucleic/enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml)) can be tried that wraps transpiling and wrapping of Julia call. This can even be preferable approach.

&amp;#x200B;

A good example of a transipiler from Python is \[Transcrypt\]([https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt/issues/619](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt/issues/619)) that is a valid Python prior transpiling. But to achieve 1. this should be more like Julia in Python syntax than attempt to implement Python's standard library.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it should be done via IDE friendly mapping and juthon module with source to source mapping for Julia autocompletion and lynting passthrough as it seems that automatic creating of typed and documented python stubs would require more work than source mapping; for example Julia to python transpiling for other modules inspection. That would mean lack of type inspection inside IDE - errors should be displayed by jit transpiler and later julia compiler.

&amp;#x200B;

All of us are contributing to Big Data. Data is piling up very fast. We are not even able to process 5 percentage of available data from Social media, manufacturing systems, medical devices, logistic services, and countless others generate petabytes of data on a daily basis.

With a wealth of data available, we are at a point in history, where we can conduct analyses to detect, discover, and, ultimately, better understand the world around us.

Data scientists are responsible for discovering insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data to help shape or meet specific business needs and goals. The data scientist role is becoming increasingly important as businesses rely more heavily on data analytics to drive decision-making and lean on automation and machine learning as core components of their IT strategies.

Approach:
1. Take care of outliers, missing values, etc.
2. Transform all independent variables to be positively correlated with the dependent variable.
3. Fit a linear regression model.
4. Divide every model parameter/weight by their sum and multiple by 100. This gives % value of the weight for each independent variable compared to sum of all the weights.
5. Now say if the dependent variable changed by 'x', then 'x' multiple by the % of a particular independent variable will give the change magnitude in the dependent variable due that particular independent variable.

Does anyone have experience dealing with such projects? Date based project/notebook naming seems quite interesting (e.g.: `2019-03-05_thing-to-analyze-1`), but I'm afraid it might make it harder to understand which stuff is old and which stuff has been recently revisited.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently looking for a budding data science teammate to build out and expand on the analytics for an app I'm working on. What's a good place to look for budding data scientists looking to grow the resume/portfolio? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**:

Last year, I spent several months studying data science in hopes of working in behavioral health analytics. I loved it, but grew tired of analyzing random datasets for my portfolio; I really wanted to analyze my own data, but wanted to automate the process as much as possible. I switched over to web &amp; mobile dev and began work on the app in React Native. After several months, I finally launched the app in December. I was proud of the product, but also recognize that it needs some love, especially on the analytics side. Soon after launch, I landed a mobile dev gig at a startup and haven't had time to sit down and do everything solo like I used to. It has a (very) modest user base and I want to continue development on the side. It's obviously just volunteer work - the app is currently free - but I'd be happy to chat about options if it goes somewhere!

Anyway, many thanks. If this isn't the sub to look, my apologies. If you do know where I might find interested souls, please let me know!",14,16,False,self,,,,,

After being in industry for a while I've observed there tends to be about 4 main different flavours of 'data scientist':

* Data Analyst
5 or 10 years ago, these people would've just been called BI analysts or data analysts- just doing basic data viz, reporting, dashboards and SQL querying. Then companies started to try and sex up these positions by giving them a new buzzword title 'data scientist'. There may be a few of these people who do some basic ML and stats but in my experience this is uncommon. Usually good with tools like Tableau etc

* Statistician
Again, 5 or 10 years ago, these people would've just been called statisticians or mathematicians. They focus mainly on inferential modelling or if they do predictive it's using traditional statistical techniques like linear regression. These guys are highly skilled in stats theory and some in ML as well, but they tend not to have great CS/software engineering skills, and usually their work consists of ad hoc analyses that they aren't responsible for delivering to production. Typically program in R, or in more old school organizations maybe something like SPSS.

* Machine Learning Engineer
This is where the major growth area in 'data science' has been in the past 5-10 years IMO. These people typically have good CS/Software Engineering skills and are involved in deploying models to production. They tend to focus mainly on predictive models and most will be in strong in more 'modern' ML techniques, but some (not all) may be weaker in 'traditional stats' models. Work mainly in Python but may drop down to lower level languages when required.

* Data Engineer
These people range from plain old DBAs rebranded to Big Data Engineers who work with Spark/Hadoop/Cassandra etc and work in Scala or Python or maybe even Java. The Big Data Engineers might also be proficient in the ML libraries specific to their particular big data architecture.

To me, all of this begs the question, should we just ditch the terms 'data science' and 'data scientist'? In my opinion, they are vague, generic buzzwords that do nothing but confuse people. Be interested to hear other people's thoughts though.

It'd also be great to have a little bit of discussion about my classification system, do people think I've missed some categories, got some things wrong? Which types of 'data scientist' do you think are most in demand, attract the best salaries? What proportions of the 'data science' industry are employed in each area?

Recently we updated the library to version 0.2.0. You can install the latest version by running `pip install -U albumentations` or downloading the library from [https://github.com/albu/albumentations](https://github.com/albu/albumentations)

&amp;#x200B;

**Keypoint transformations**

We added a long-awaited feature, support for the keypoint transformations and we made [an example notebook](https://github.com/albu/albumentations/blob/master/notebooks/example_keypoints.ipynb) that shows how to use them.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/eyzerytlwjk21.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

**Apply the same transformation to the more than one target of the same type**

We also added an option to apply the same transformation to the more than one target of the same type. The possible use cases are image2image or stereo-image pipelines. So you can pass multiple images as input and all of them will be transformed in the same way using exactly the same parameters. See a more detailed description in [this notebook](https://github.com/albu/albumentations/blob/master/notebooks/example_multi_target.ipynb).

&amp;#x200B;

**Other improvements**

Also, we fixed some bugs and improved performance. Here are benchmarking results for Albumentations against other popular augmentation libraries (the best result for each transformation is shown in bold).

What does your day to day life look like? How much coding do you do? Do you code in high performance languages (e.g., C++) or mostly in interpreted languages (e.g., Python)? How much does your position involve ML? 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I want to be in a position where I can focus on machine learning and software engineering, and from speaking with the recruiter, it seems the data science positions at Google is very applied stats heavy. She sent me a study guide for the phone screening, and it's very stats heavy, a lot of stuff, which I have learned from previous stats courses many years ago that I have forgotten. So I'd probably need to put in a lot of time to study stuff related to that just for a phone screen..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to decide if this is something I'm interested in pursuing and/or if it fits my background. She made me aware that for PhD applicants at Google, you can only do a single-track interview process, meaning that I wouldn't be able to simultaneously be in the interview process for a data science, software engineering, ML position. She said she could put me in touch with the recruiter for the PhD ML software engineering positions. The title ""ML software engineering"" sounds much more aligned with my background and interest but I was always under the impression that ML and DS positions have a lot of overlap and are pretty much the same positions?

In my case, the task is a bit more difficult in that I need to detect  a number (you might have seen the way containers are labeled using a  sequence of letters and digits). Unlike car number plates, there is no  unified form of the number plate, its location might differ etc. 

The goal is to do object detection and then recognize (OCR) the code  (as I said, this is a sequence of digits and letters. Good news this  sequence is standard). 

I have a few questions:

1) The first task is to perform object localization i.e. create a training dataset of annotated images (*xmin*,*ymin*,*xmax*,*ymax*

,  height,width).  There is an issue, however. Usually, this is not the only area on  containers with digits and letters. Will the neural network be able to  learn the right location?

2) Do I need to manually segment all digits and letters inside the ""bounding box""? Or how should this stage be performed?

3) Is there any hope that Tesseract could be helpful for OCR? As far  as I know, it's not very accurate for photos. If not, what is the best  algorithm to do OCR after object detection?

4) Considering that I have almost no experience, would it be easier  to start with Tensorflow Object Detection API or Yolo for object  detection? 

Below, I am attaching an example of the number which should be detected and recognized (BMOU 441929 7)

As data science becomes more and more applicable across every industry sector, you might wonder which programming language is best for implementing your models and analysis. Since R and Python remain the most popular languages for data science, according to [IEEE Spectrum's latest rankings](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2018-top-programming-languages), it seems reasonable to debate which one is better. Although it's suggested to use the language you're most comfortable with and one that suits the needs of your organization, for the purpose of this article, we'll evaluate the two languages. We will compare R and Python in four key categories: Data Visualization, Modelling Libraries, Ease of Learning and Community Support. ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm more of a business and financial analyst who ended up moving more toward a data role and just learned programming on my own by giving myself projects over the years.

I want to expand both my own knowledge and career prospects in other data roles, and maybe even get a data science role in the future. I have experience creating web scrapers, plotting, running linear and exponential regressions, various data cleaning and manipulation, SQL, etc.

I lack the math skills. The last math class I took was in college (so over 14 years ago) and the farthest I ever went is multivariable calculus. I forgot pretty much all of this, and maybe some people out there would be able to attest to the ease or difficulty in picking up the basics again if they've been in a similar situation. I did pass 2 levels of CFA, which is a difficult finance exam, and that contained bachelor-level statistics. I did that in 2009 I think, so 10 years ago :)

I see that the MITx micromasters has a prerequisite requirement of multivariable calculus. How difficult would this be for someone in my shoes? I don't want to take the class for free - I'd want the cert and be able to at least put it on a resume in the Other section. I'd have my company pay for the whole thing, so the cost doesn't really factor in.

I genuinely like programming, creating interesting visualizations that summarize and explain data patterns in a digestible way for other business users, and am interested in learning the other things I don't know - neural networks, deep learning, machine learning, etc.

What drew me to this particular program is the fact that you can put MIT on your resume (and yes, I know that any data scientist wouldn't really care about MITx, but it's better than nothing), it seems pretty robust from both a math and machine learning perspective, and I would be keeping my skills a bit more up-to-date and fresh. I don't see automation and data roles losing popularity anytime soon, and want to be best prepared for my own future career prospects. If I ever got laid off, I want to be able to get another six figure job with all my skills, and this program seems to at least legitimize some skills on a resume. Also, since I work in a data-heavy role, I could actually apply what I learn to my actual job, giving me more credibility within my own company.

So right now we have the Amazon customer reviews dataset which has all the customer reviews of all the products till 2015. 
In another dataset, we scraped data from Buzzfeed shopping section of about 190 articles meaning we have all the products with their corresponding amazon links.

What we're not exactly sure is how to proceed with what we want to do. 

We're confused as to how to use NLP here. For machine-learning we have some idea as to what the features could be for each product (like its ratings, its category, etc.) and so it trains on that and then gets the corresponding products from the customer reviews dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for a job described as Data Scientist / Data Analyst in a big company somewhere in Europe. This big company has a new department in data analytics and they are hiring  new people as thing have been going well and they are understaffed.

 I go to the interview, I do a project, bla bla, you know the process. Now the thing is, before the last interview they told me my profile wouldn't fit one of Data Scientist, as I don't have the coding experience they are looking for.

Anyway, I understood that if I wasn't not becoming a DS I would be a DA ( From my research these are two different things, right?) . Now the thing is, the offer came something like an IT Audit position.

My background is in Finance and I have a  Master in Micro Data analysis.

What does my background has to do with IT Audit, and how is IT Audit related with data analysis and so forth?

My ultimate goal would be to be a Data Scientist, and I would like to know how (and if) being a IT Audit brings me closer to this goal.

My feeling is that they confused DS/DA and they just sold me the IT Audit because they need people.

During the meeting many questions were asked about what technologies to go for and no answer to them. It has been highlighted that we needed a Data Architect to make some choices but no plan to hire one.

I stepped forward to express my desire to fil the gap although not having all the knowledge required but willing to learn about everything needed.

One thing I have been thinking about is what kind of metrics to use to validate the confidence of the actual score outputted by the model. e.g. If a model outputs a score ('probability') of 0.74, what is the expected chance that the predicted event will actually occur?

&amp;#x200B;

The initial assumption might be that there is a 74% chance but that seems to be confusing the model's score with a confident probability which doesn't seem right. I've also looked into MC DropOut as a method of estimating confidence, but I'm curious about situations where Neural Networks aren't in play. My initial guess on how to approach this would be to deploy the classifier for a while and collect data on it's predictions and the actual future outcomes. Then, taking all of the predicted scores (that we take no action on), I would bin them up so that there's a bin for all the predicted scores in \[0.7, 0.75\] and a bin for predicted scores of \[.85, .9\], and so on. Then, I would calculate the average proportion of people that had the event occur, and would expect roughly 72.5% of the people to have the event occur in the first bin, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I'm wondering if there is any way to quantify this better? I'm guessing research has probably been done on this and I just haven't come across it. Any ideas on good lines of research to look into, or maybe examples where this is already being done?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've heard of Bayesian deep learning methods like MC Dropout that let you estimate how confident the model is in it's prediction. However, are there any techniques that generalize to more types of models that will let you estimate how confident you can be in your models predicted scores?",12,5,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

**Some background:** I have been in academia after college, and my major is astronomy.  I earned my PhD degree (in astrophysics) in Europe last year. Currently working as a postdoc in the same field but i decided to leave academia for industry. I know I have skills in math, statistics and programming, and I know I can learn things fast.   


**Now:** Even though I want to leave academia I still want to keep working on data. So I am looking for jobs titled such as data analyst. I sent out almost countless applications, and also had some interviews (company size from startup to big international ones). During the interview processes, I usually don't pass the technical tasks/ business cases. They always told me that even they like (or found interesting) my way of analysing the data, it doesn't really match what they want. Or sometimes they implied that I don't have the business mindset or business solving experience.   


I really don't know what to improve this.. I have never worked outside of the school (not even a part time job at a bar or internship in any company)... I was always in the astronomy field and I have no experience with business.  
Now I am seriously thinking of some data bootcamps, I found this D2S2 in London, Data Science Retreat and Spiced in Berlin. I hope that maybe through a intense bootcamp training I could not only improve my programming skills in the direction that business want. I have also heard from other people that the students at the camps would be assigned with some business-related projects with companies, from which (they claimed) we would have potential chance to get hired.   


I don't really know how useful the bootcamps are. Almost all the reviews online are super positive that I sometimes doubt they are fake... Also, they are really expensive, even though I know it might worth it if I can get a job afterwards.   


So I want to ask your honest opinion, if this is the right way for me to approach if I want to switch from pure academia to data science? If I am too naive about it, please also tell me why and what the reality really looks like out there.. Thank you in advance.  


**TLDR:** Is data bootcamp a good idea for a academic who currently wants to leave science and has trouble passing business solving at interviews?

I work as a lead project manager for a very large company. I am good at my job (or at least my yearly performance reviews say that) but I honestly don't like my job. I am regularly given failing projects and tasked with replanning the project. The stress is wearing me out. I want to work in data science - I'll have my MSc in applied statistics within the year and I'm working on creating a portfolio and getting my first data science job. I incorporate data science techniques into what I do and I credit that with what makes me successful.


Situation: 
My company is very antiquated and slow to adopt new technologies. At the end of last year they announced they were going to start embedding data analysts within teams and hire some data scientists. I thought great, here's my chance to get into the field. 


I cannot get an interview to be a data analyst because, according to the hiring manager, I don't have experience. It's frustrating because I regularly demonstrate the application of the needed skills and knowledge, but okay fine.


Fast forward a few weeks a newly hired data analyst is imbeded with my team. I try to make the best of it and think, hey, I can talk data science with this guy.


The person hired has a background as a finance analyst. He doesn't know statistics or any programming languages. He had to ask me for help writing a simple SQL query so he could put it into Excel and make a pivot chart. The hiring managers are business people who don't know anything about data science. The data analysts are being used as Excel jockies.


I don't fault the people hired as data analysts but it frustrates me that the managers have no idea what they are doing in regards to hiring and utilizing data analysts. I feel like within my company they are devaluing data science by having people not in the field doing the hiring and management of the analysts. It's looking more and more like I'll have to leave the company to work in my desired field. That will be difficult because I'll likely have to take a pay cut to get a job elsewhere.

Thank you so much. You've given me a lot of information, so please don't feel pressured to reply again.

With how you have worded things, it seems like the opportunity for me to do research has set and sailed. I'm 25 and want more than 3 years work experience before I turn 30 and age discrimination starts to become a serious issue for me down the road. I'm not making $60k; I'm unemployed haven't even had my first job yet.

I only did one year of unimpressive/uneventful research during my Bachelor's, so I basically have 0 (none) research experience. I've been told that, if I do a coursework based Master's when my credentials allow for a research based Master's, it will be a huge red flag.

Furthermore, I've been told that having an acceptable Coursework Only Master's GPA, Advanced 6-Sigma Certification, Years of experience in Data Analytics/Science, Letters of Recommendation based only on coursework, 0 research experience, and even Great GRE scores will make it very very unlikely to get accepted to even the lowest ranked PhD programs.

Essentially, I started applying for work in industry 3 to 5 years later than my peers and I need to catch up. I am years behind in research experience and need to catch up. I had 6 years to do research and get work experience but did not due to bad parental advice, poor time management and medical reasons outside my control.  I only get to choose to catch up in one area in the next 10 to 15 years.

Realistically...neglecting work experience is the stupidest thing I could do because I would end up in upwards of $60,000-$100,000 debt with a Master's or 31 years old with a likely average PhD and no work history. I may as well be homeless. **(Here we were talking about the sheer difficulty of working while trying to take a class for credit and do good research. I'm DQ'd from the military.)**

Maybe in 15 years when I am 40 I can start preparations for a PhD program and graduate with my PhD at 46 or later. That's up to a million dollars of lost income however if I don't work part time during the PhD as well. Sinking 4+ years into a 'lowly' Master's Degree as you put it may not be a bad thing if I am working full time and experiencing career advancement and promotions into Data Science and Management along the way.

It just seems like, if I am following an optimization toward life, doing anything with research and work autonomy has become a very net negative decision.

Part of it is that people have always called me bright, and my favorite statistics professor always said he feels I could do great things in graduate school and looks forward to reading about my accomplishments inside literature in the future.

I always really appreciated that, and part of me wants to see if that potential reality is still obtainable for me. Like, if I could do a coursework based Master's Program and get accepted into a PhD program when I've made substantial contribution to industry and want to go to the next level, that would make me overjoyed.

However, I'm told that is stupidly unfeasible. Maybe I should just focus on having a nice career and creating a happy family.

Edit: The only thought I have now is that if I go that route, I would only pusue a PhD if my future marriage deteriorated and ended in a divorce. At that point, I would need a serious change in scenery.

I've mellowed out a bit since posting this, and now have difficulting figuring out how much of this is true. I could really use some realism as I'm kinda lost right now and possibly worrying too much in the future.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

### Why build ""a minimalist scheduler""?

A few months ago [I asked what the sub thought about current data pipeline technologies](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9uz05o/whats_your_opinion_on_current_data_pipeline/). The consensus was that Airflow was the best option, but every popular option requires significant resources to learn and implement.

I'm a data scientist working on a young product. I made that post at a time when we were unsure how to automate our data pipeline. Airflow is free, sure, but things weren't breaking yet and the time investment made Airflow an expensive option for us. We decided to point CRON jobs to shell scripts instead. It was fast, cheap, and easy to debug in the rare event of failure. It wasn't a permanent solution; it was a good-enough-for-now solution.

A revisited the problem a couple months later, and I realized there must be hundreds of teams like mine in this limbo: still unable to justify the cost of Airflow and growing too fast to rely on CRON and shell scripts. Clearly there's a need, yet there was no such scheduler that I could find. 

I started engineering my own solution. I didn't need all of Airflow's features. I thought, ""What can I take away from Airflow to make scheduling more accessible?""I took away the UI. I took away the sqlite database. I took away asynchronous scheduling, bash operator, and triggers. I kept the scheduling, dynamic configuration, python operators. I even added some functionality to support virtualenv, pipenv, and conda environments. 

What remained was Dequindre: a minimalist scheduler I could setup in minutes. It's production-capable too. We're migrating to use Dequindre on my team at work. 

### What's Next?  

Dequindre v0.10 marks the start of ""public beta testing"" means I'll be answering public bugs, questions, and feature requests. I'll release Dequindre v1.0 when I'm confident the core functionality is tight. Right now I guess that might be April or June. There might be a v2.0 and beyond, but Dequindre is minimalist by design; there's only so many features I'll consider adding before recommending something more full-featured like Airflow.

We're two friend who met in college and learned Python together, we co-created a package which can provide an estimate for the training time of scikit-learn algorithms.

Here is our idea of the use case for this tool:  
When you are in the process of building a machine learning model or deploying your code to production, knowledge of how long your algorithm can help you validate and test that there are no errors in your code without wasting precious time.  
As far as we know there was no practical automated way of evaluating the runtime of an algo before running it. This tries to solve this problem. It especially helps in the case of heavy models when you want to keep your sklearn.fit under control.

  
Lets say you wanted to train a kmeans clustering for example, given an input matrix X. Heres how you would compute the runtime estimate:

    From sklearn.clusters import KMeans
from scitime import Estimator
kmeans = KMeans()
estimator = Estimator(verbose=3)
Run the estimation
estimation, lower_bound, upper_bound = estimator.time(kmeans, X)

*  Work that the company tries to outsource to the people applying, so they can reuse the code for themselves.

* Live questions on things i have studied 3 or more years ago (like what is the domain of tanh)

&amp;#x200B;

Some background (without giving away too much PI): I had a varied education and career path to this point. Both my BSc, MSc, and PhD were in STEM fields. I decided to make the switch to data science after seeing some friends have success in the area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had no formal experience in data science/AI, although I had much coding experience (mainly python and matlab) from my degrees. So I decided to self teach data science and then apply for jobs. There were many ups and downs in the process as a whole, and a lot of lessons I learned as I went along in the job hunt. 

&amp;#x200B;

To form a solid understanding of the machine learning field, I started by going through a machine learning primer on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net). I found a nice mix of math theory (low level) and code. The course covered all of the main algorithms used in machine learning by first explaining the behind the scenes idea and then coding a algorithm from scratch and then (in some cases) using it on a dataset. Towardsdatascience also is great (for the right author) for getting a quick easy overview of something. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this I applied to my first round of jobs, and found that this is probly not enough to get in the field. I got a few interviews, but response rate was about 7% of my applications (applied for about 50 jobs). I applied for all jobs online, via indeed, glassdoor, etc. While applying I started an excel file listing all applications and dates applied. This gave me a way to measure response rates and see what helped increase this. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, after realizing I needed something more, I took on a new undertaking. I reworked through in depth math of the popular algorithms using Elements of Statistical Learning (textbook freely available online). Then, I found some data sets online (either off kaggle or the UCI repository) and went through an entire in depth project on these sets. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive. I mean really clean out the problem, I read publications about the dataset, established baselines, interpreted results, etc. I then made a github account and made a data science portfolio and posted a couple of projects on there. Then I reopened the application process and applied to about 50 more jobs. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ANY ADVICE TAKE THIS: make a porfolio and post a project. Choose a project that is socially relevant and any layman could see why its interesting (ie healthcare, not Gaussian data distributions). This astronomically increased my responses. I would estimate that, per 20 applications, I got interviews for 5-6 jobs. After much interviewing I finally got a good offer which I accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Interviews follow the same basic structure everywhere, and here's what I learned going through them:

1) The HR screen. After bungling a couple of these I finally figured them out; after an HR screen now I would say I have a near 100% conversion rate to a second round interview. They don't know technical stuff, they want to get an idea of who you are and make sure you aren't a weirdo and can articulate yourself. So here's how to ace them: find a project you worked on and explain the technical concepts to them in VERY easy to understand ways. I found explaining algorithms using sports analogies very effective. Relate the project to someone who doesn't care about data science; why is the problem interesting, what are implications of your results. Besides that be prepared to answer the basics like ""why are you interested in this company"", ""how do you face challenges"", etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) the technical interview. The contents of this stage really varies. Most times, I would be asked to explain technical aspects of my DS projects. They would start off with ""explain a project youve worked on and how you solved it"". Why did I use this algorithm and not another, why did I do a dimensional reduction, how did I clean the data, etc. Then, I would get asked to explain the workings of a particular algo I had used. Some would ask that I explain it to someone who didn't know about computers, and some would ask I explain the math and algorithm structure. If you paid attention to my first point you'll be ready for the layman explanation. So be prepared for both. I would really prepare a nice ""lecture"" about an algo, because some would just say ""explain your favorite algorithm"".  Some will go through your resume and ask you to explain buzzwords, so be prepared for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) the coding challenge. These are annoying. They are generally easy, most I got were binary classification problems. A couple I got were just data sets and they said ""do something interesting"". If you've done a DS project it shouldn't be hard. The annoying part is that most would say ""this should take about 4 hours, heres 5 days to turn it in"". So what I imagine happens, is some candidates spend 4 hours and get some interesting insights and send it off, and others spend 5 days straight doing a crazy analysis of it. One company arranged a time I would like the challenge to be sent to me, and I had to submit results within 4 hours. I think this is the best format, as it really puts everyone on the same playing field. I would suggest doing a very simple practice classification problem from a common dataset (the UCI wine thing for example) and just get a ""template"" ready that isn't too difficult to change between basic datasets. Also, some jobs that blasted me a dataset without a phone call or email first I found quite rude and didn't pursue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Final tips: I know many people on this sub complain about buzzword resumes; but Ill offer a different take. The people who get a giant pile of resumes to sort through are the HR people; I had a friend who is an HR rep for a DS company look over my resume. These HR people don't know DS; they have a job description for a role that has buzzwords in it (candidate should know regression, tensorflow, blah blah) and they match your resume to that. So I found that by including buzzwords  (for experimental lab work I described it as lab data analysis rather than lab assistant, listed algorithms I knew, math I knew)  I increased my response rate.

&amp;#x200B;

 Also I added a section in my resume explaining the DS projects I had done and tools I used to do them (bold font the tools used for fast reading), this also increases response rate (link to your github portfolio too). All in all, the job hunt process is a meat grinder and sucks. I sent out a total of about 100 job applications, got a couple cheapo offers that I declined, and accepted a solid one. I completed about 30 interviews. The jobs I didn't get interviews for I think is because I didn't match the description exactly or didn't match the experience requirement, lots of them want big data framework experience which I didn't have (hadoop, apache etc). This would be easy to learn, but the screeners don't know this really so probly tossed my resume. I would've learned it myself but getting 4 coding challenges a week bogs you down a bit :P. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, the increase in interview requests and inceased knowledge is not just a correlation, it's a causation. As you're applying, learn something new everyday. ",38,108,False,self,,,,,

I'e recently become very interested in pursuing a career in data science, but am at a crossroads on how to approach transitioning into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background on me:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a strong aptitude for math/statistics, and have no problem learning on my own. When I got my MBA, I really enjoyed the data modeling and analytics aspects of the curriculum and thrived. However, my target role after the graduating was more focused on being a product manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the technical side, I am fairly new to programming, although when it comes to programming for math-related tasks (as opposed to design-related), I tend to pick things up quickly. I've learned SQL on my own, and am picking up python at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right, I'm in a senior-level marketing position at a startup which has allowed me to build and refine a lot of 'soft skills': communication, stakeholder management and team leadership. However, this role has also made me realize how much work I have left to do on the 'hard skills' side of things.

I've entertained the idea of going back to school: there are in-person one-year programs and 2-year online programs in my state that seem pretty well regarded. However, I've heard conflicting reports on their usefulness, especially considering how much content and expertise is available online. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas on the best approach?

The two options I'm looking at are Carnegie's Comp Bio, and GA Tech's Analytics/DS.  

Are DS master's programs just cash cows? Do employers prefer to see an graduate degree in a field where you pick up lots of analytical skills as opposed to a program that directly focuses on them? When two programs are similar, should the deciding factor be a school's reputation and alumni network?

#####About myself:

* Bachelor's in Genetics as well as Comp Sci, plus Math minor
* Not interested in research anymore, but did it for ~3 years 
* Applied for CMU MS DS as well, but haven't heard back yet (second wave of admission incoming, though)

I understand that either program will provide a solid basis for data science. However, I'm concerned with whether I'll be pigeonholed for only biology-related roles if I do the CMU program. I've established that I'm not interested in research or academia (hence, not pursuing a PhD), and I can see from [CMU's posted first destinations](https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/2017_one_pagers/scs/Combined_SCS_MS_2017_Final.pdf) (page 2) that only ~10% of their alumni continued in academia, whereas more than 50% of them went into DS/ML/SDE.

###Carnegie Mellon University:
* Computational Biology MS
* Stellar reputation for graduate CS (#1) and technology in general
* 2 year program
* [Curriculum](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/curriculum) has machine learning, math &amp; statistics, and elective courses like cloud computing, machine learning w/Big Data, deep learning

###Georgia Tech
* Analytics MS
* Top 10 in graduate CS (#8), great technical school
* 1 year program (fall, spring, summer)
* [Curriculum](https://analytics.gatech.edu/curriculum/computational-data-analytics-track) has a computational data analytics track that addresses visualization and has many courses relevant to the business insights side of things 

&amp;nbsp;  
I'm personally leaning towards CMU because of the length of the program (more time to absorb info + take relevant elective courses) and their repute as the number one school for computer science (should certainly help with landing a job in tech, yeah?). That said Georgia Tech's program would be directly relevant to the field I'm looking to go into and would be immensely cheaper ($70k cheaper, due to program duration + a TA-ship).

With all of these threads popping up I figured I would share my take on the process and what I feel is or is not beneficial. **I'm going to break it down by assessment focus and then by speciality**
______
**The Phone Screen**

Believe it or not this section is extremely valuable- more than you'd realize. The HR person or junior team member you are speaking to is not a complete dunce, but they're no expert either. **If you can't explain your experiences in skills in a way that the person can understand, chances are you couldn't survive any sort of business/stakeholder meeting** with non-technical stakeholders. The number 1 issue I see lately with many very experienced candidates is they cannot explain themselves out of a paper bag if it's not a room full of technical people. Even then I've seen countless DS meetings devolve into bickering over minutiae with zero actual outcomes. **The most successful candidates regardless of speciality can flip this switch on and off with ease** and about 70% of our final round rejections are because of communication difficulties.

-**CS/Eng focus**- Usually the person on the phone has some knowledge about various stacks or often is an actual ML or Data Engineer. If you're in an org in which you deal with another Eng team, lots of time that team are not necessarily going to have the exact same skills focus. I see this a lot with Data Engineering teams in orgs that are largely worried about building product data lakes. I once sat and watched 2 people spend 30 minutes unable to speak to one another about the cache rate of a data field. Chances are if you can't convince someone that you have vaguely relevant skills or experiences in a 30min call you're going to be a pain in the ass for cross-functional partners.

-**Strategy/Finance/Business facing** Oh man, you're about to deal with a lot of people that only know about regression because of an Excel tutorial. You're going to presume that your customers are data literate, but they're far from it. If you can't give 2-3 sentence DS for Dummies answers about every part of your code or outputs, you're going to kill velocity.

-**Data Scientists** At this stage we just want to see how many projects you have successfully managed or contributed to and on what time horizon. It's too easy to throw around buzzwords or copy Kaggle code (not the worst idea for the timed take home stuff I will get to later). I'm on these panels a lot and what I **want to see are the steps you took in the process as a response to specs, iterations, or business needs.** Recruiters are pretty good at filtering out people that can't explain this succinctly.

**The Take Home**

We can tell exactly how long you spent on these assignments because we often came up with the ""answers"" ourselves. We almost always give data that has a few columns of pure noise, some tricks (strings stored as bit64 is a really solid one people fail to identify), usually an irregular time series of some sort, and it's either a basic regression or classification problem.

What we want to see:

-If we ask for the code, we will run it. You wouldn't believe how much hacky shit we get back that does not run, has error messages, or someone decided to use a more complex method than they needed to and didn't configure specific options correctly.
-Most of the datasets are around 1-2mil records. We know you didn't pre-process it, add rolling or lead/lag variables (that suck up time), use tons of methods for checking skew and correlation, train your model (often several models to compare)",0,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I am 21 years old, I am little bit lazy student with 2.6/4 GPA.

I already have a bachelor of Mathematics  and currently I am studying computer science at university. After studying 3 years, I have to choose a major (field) to study for one year and half and then do a final study internship at it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having a hard choice (because no option is totally better than the other option for me) between choosing ""Data Science and going to this challenging field"" or ""take a safe path and go to  Web Development"".

&amp;#x200B;

We all know that there is a big competition in Data Science and I am scared that I don't catch-up with them.

I heard some people say that Data Science requires a lot of hard work, challenges.

**1-Can a student with just attending university courses and spending few hours learning at the internet succeed at this field ?** ( by few hours I mean spending about 4-5 hours each week ) .

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I find interesting about Data Science is Machine Learning.

I like programming, creating applications and I don't mind coding for hours and searching to fix errors. so I am thinking to choose Web Development over Data Science because it's easier and a safe path but then I tell myself that a Data Scientist  makes more money than a web developer  so maybe in the future I will regret taking the Data Science Challenge .

**2-What career path should I take ?** ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I've always been an Excel nerd and into data, so I'm doing self-study trying to learn data science basics. I'm working through a stats &amp; probability textbook and Udemy's Data Science Bootcamp. I know I have a LOT to learn. 

However, all the advice I see seems to encourage people to just start making basic data visualization projects and posting them to a portfolio because the best way to learn is through actively doing projects. I don't understand how I'm supposed to do this when I'm not using Python or R to generate my visualizations (just Excel/Google Sheets) and I can't even figure out how to set up a Github portfolio (readmes? branches? repositories? I get lost reading the guide). I've tried looking at other ""portfolios"" and I don't really understand what I'm looking at.

Sure, I could publish my chart/data/analysis to a Wordpress site, but that seems rather unprofessional. I'm struggling to figure out how to get some first-hand experience when most of it requires a certain baseline level of programming knowledge that I don't yet have. Is there any resource online that can walk me through this or explain what I need to be doing? 

Again, I'm not looking for a shortcut and I know I have to learn all of this the hard way. I'm just wondering if I'm missing something because I'd like to start publishing projects just for my own reference and practice.

I am here because I need some advice on what path to take for my studies. I feel like the options are so wide and I am a bit overwhelmed. I'll introduce myself first so you can have the ""big picture"":

# Introduction

There is a tldr for this part right after it.

I am a 21 years old male from Quebec. I was always really good with maths and have a great intuition with everything math-related (well up until Analysis 3 and CLOSED BALL IS NOT COMPACT IN C\[0,1\] WUT?) .  4 years ago I entered my university in Mathematics (actuarial sc. specialization). I figured after taking Economics and Fin. that it wasn't for me, and I really liked discrete maths and analysis so I switched for pure maths.  
I stayed in pure maths for 3 semesters and I really liked it, but I realized that it's more like a hobby than a career path for me (I really don't see myself doing research). This is where I first started gaining an interest in programming. I did not know about data science yet. I decided to change to Math + Computer Science in march, near the end of the winter semester. It was a good move since like 90% of my credits were still good.

I then spent the summer learning C++ as I didn't know in what area of C.S I would end up and I like a challenge (plus I felt like it would help me understands the core of programming more than if I would have started with say Python). Eventually I heard about data science during the semester and I knew it was made for me (I LOVE problem solving, I am good with intuition, finding the optimal way to do things, maths, etc).   
Fast forward to today and here I am: A math and computer science undergrad (but with like 3 math credits left and almost all of them in CS to do). I am pretty good with C++ (I understand well the core of the language, so I can do pretty much every intermediate-level console app assignments that I can find in books easily). I got my first programming class two semesters ago in JavaScript and I aced it since I saw everything by myself in C++ (I must say I hate JS, so web development got out of the question pretty quick). I am now doing Programming 2 in Java and it's the same story.

   I picked up ""Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"" by Adam Drozdek and am currently in Chapter 3. I have an overview knowledge of every main data structure and I am trying to understand it in depth with this book. It's good that it's old, because since took a modern C++ class (well free online course I mean), I can try to reimplement the examples in the book but in modern C++. I already passed the Complexity Theory chapter (it was really brieve though) and I understand it well since it's basic maths. I have a good understanding of basic Probabilities and statistics (Let's say I do well with the 10 first chapters of ""Introduction to Probability and Statistics"" by Mendenhall)

## TLDR
* Third year Math + Computer Science undergrad
* Strong pure math background (Analysis 3, differential geometry, Algebra, linear algebra, etc...)
* Core understanding of Probabilities and Stats (10 first chapters of ""Introduction to Probability and Statistics"" by Mendenhall) AND stochastics process (Markov, semi-Markov, Poisson's, etc)
* Good with problem solving
* Good with core C++ and a good part of STL
* Can code basic stuff with JavaScript, Java and Python
* Good with basic git (up to pull requests / branching)

# What next?

The reason I am here today is because I don't know where to go from there. I am really motivated, but the options I have are really wide. I am really curious about machine learning and I think I will orient myself towards it, but I'm open to other paths too.

* I could continue with my ""Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"" book (which I will probably do since it's pretty important imo
* I could start learning Python and it's libraries
* I could start learning R and it's libraries
* I could start learning machine learning (the theory)
* I could continue with C++ (Qt, SFML, other?) to understand programming more in-depth
* I could learn SQL
* I could strenghten my Probability and Statistics knowledge (Numerical Analysis? Linear Regression? Tests?)

This is my ideas right now but of course it's what *I* see, and I would like to hear YOUR opinions. I found [this image](https://i.ibb.co/C53pvQJ/Data-Science-parcours.jpg) but I'm not sure it's completely accurate and it still has many options. 
What should I do? What should I NOT do? I want to hear your opinions!

Thank you very much for reading, I know when I start I can write long texts and I'm sorry for this. I hope I hear from some of you!

 I want to develop attribution model which will help in identifying %  contribution to the change in dependent variable, due to changes in  independent variables.

**Approach:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Take care of outliers, missing values, etc.
2. Transform all independent variables to be positively correlated with the dependent variable.
3. Fit a linear regression model.
4. Divide every model parameter/weight by their sum and multiple by  100. This gives % value of the weight for each independent variable  compared to sum of all the weights.
5. Now say if the dependent variable changed by 'x', then 'x' multiple  by the % of a particular independent variable will give the change  magnitude in the dependent variable due that particular independent  variable.

Would love to get your thoughts/expertise on the best way to structure a Tableau team within an organization. Our team recently prototyped building reports using Tableau and management absolutely loved it. However, our concern is the amount of business partners that might come to us going forward to help build dashboards for them, which would be overwhelming.

Few Questions:

1. What do you think works better? A centralized or decentralized model? 
2. As a business unit, we are by no way ""IT"" and would want not want to maintain every single dashboard we build going forward.
3. Do you guys have a Tableau ""center of excellence"" to train other users in the organization on Tableau?

I've written a time series outlier detection algorithm in which for each time-series I have, I iterate over the series with a lagging and leading array straddling some observation of interest. Each observation has 4 variables that I'm interested in for each iteration. I calculate the mean of the lag and lead for each step as well as some other operations / boolean statements. If some condition is met, I flag the value by appending it to a list. 

&amp;#x200B;

This step is the main bottle neck of my algorithm and it seems like something I could easily distribute across my 8-core computer, which I bought for parallelization. I'm a student but am kind of lost as to which package I should invest my time into.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two main questions:

1. What packages / services / possibly even langauges (Julia?) are worth learning?
2. In the context of the problem at hand, what is the most intuitive way to assign a process to a core? Should I assign one time series to a core at a time or distribute one time series over all of my cores? To elaborate on what I mean in the latter, for a time series with n observations I could split it into n/8 np.arrays and then do the above mentioned calculations on each core.

Knitty is language agnostic and can be used with any Jupyter kernel. Can be used independently of Pandoctools and with any IDE of choise. So I guess it deserves a separate post. By the way: Atom/Hydrogen is also language agnostic. You can also try **VS Code** interface to Jupyter from [**vscode-python**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python) instead of Atom/Hydrogen.

in our company, my Data Science team is currently struggling with the 'last mile', i.e. have our insights and predictions bring about actual change.

We have sufficiently mastered the technical aspects, with APIs and platform at our disposal and available to others. Also, we've established trust with senior management executives.

What remains is to convince coworkers from other departments, e.g. sales, to work with us. Many hesitate to cooperate or to make use of our results and our work, and I feel like this boils down to a couple of human reasons:
- The generally resist change, especially when initiated by others
- Their division manager might have a long-standing rivalry with our division manager
- They see us and our suggestions/results as 'invading their territory'
- They view us as young and snobbish know-it-alls

How would you approach this problem? 

As a last measure, we could make our case with the executive level and have them pressure their guys to cooperate. However, we'd really like to solve this problem 'bottom-up' instead of 'top-down'.

Cheers and thank you!
Derek

For the sake of having some objective definition, we are defining data science leadership as professionals that fall in one of two buckets:

**Senior Management Data Scientists:**

* Supervise a team of data scientists
* Responsible for defining overall data science strategy for company (e.g., defining career paths, building capabilities, growing the footprint of data science within the company)
* Title expected to be Director level or higher (though not a hard rule as some companies brutally undertitle their people).
* Not necessarily expected to be most technical person in the organization

**Higher-level individual contributors:**

* May or may not supervise a team of data scientists
* Responsible for identifying emerging trends and their feasibility for your company, and to own the technical development of data science initiatives for your company/major function (e.g., Finance, Sales, etc.)
* Expected to be most technical person in the organization, and serve as subject matter expert for both junior data scientists and senior business leadership.
* Title expected to be Principal Data Scientist or higher (though, again, not a hard rule as some companies call their most senior data scientists just Senior Data Scientists).

**What we are asking from you:**

Once a month, we will post a thread for users to propose a question for the panel. The question with the most votes will be shared with the members of the panel through a direct message. You will then have one week to provide your answer to the question - we are expecting this to be a 2-3 paragraph exercise, so not something that requires an essay. Once you have submitted your answer, I will compile all the answers and post them to a new thread, referencing each user and their respective answer. We will the open the thread for additional commentary from the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

**If you believe you meet the criteria and want to participate:**

\- Send me a PM with a brief outline of your qualifications (doesn't need to be much more than what is included in your flair, would be helpful to include years of experience)

OR

\- Post your qualifications on this thread (same as above)

I will compile the list manually and then begin the process once we have a critical mass of people to answer questions. I don't expect to get an overwhelming number of sign-ups, but if we do, we may change up the panel on a month-to-month basis to get everyone involved and not end up with too many answers to the same question.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them!

I guess Id sum up my question as: why write lines of code in Python to create a plot, change the width of the line, add a title, and makes the bars of the values red and some blue, when you could just drag and drop? 

Finally in reporting using Python and R visualization, how do you distribute the results to customers? Export the charts to Excel? Can they be hosted on a cloud platform? Im completely ignorant of how reporting works using Python and R visualization and Im curious on hearing some explanations.

I've looked at predictive modeling on this topic but the academic research i've seen does modeling that updates as the auction happens. That's not quite what I would like to see. I'm trying to predict the final price of an item that goes through an online auction portal but i'm getting varied results that are hard to improve. These are my metrics so far with the best (what I believe is the best) model.

Adjusted R2 Score: 96%

MAPE: 13%

RMSLE: 0.17240

The main two I am focusing on are R2 and MAPE. I honestly think the metrics aren't too bad so far but i'm trying to get them to a really impressive state. The main issue I am having is similar items (product name, condition, reviews of seller) can all be the same but final prices can be very different from one day to the next when the auction is completed. Don't know how to account for what is seemingly a random process of an item going up or down. Seasonality doesn't have much of effect. So the day of the week or month or time of the year doesn't impact it much.

It might be dumb question ;)

I've decided to move beyond statistical learning theory and do something practical. I'm currently trying to perform EDA while dealing with imbalanced dataset (9:1 proportions). I've so far explored maybe 10 features out of 50 as well as their combinations, but visualy I've failed to find any sign of possible decision boundary. It's seems like class with lower share is always dominated.

I realized that maybe my perception of EDA is incorrect and it's not about that. I've never understood why some people on kaggle do some density charts and no matter what they got they just end up using xgboost.

This is an excerpt from a recent article regarding Chris Kelsey, who claims to be the world's first trillionaire:

Last year you may have heard the news that I would soon become the worlds first trillionaire. I was being modest at the time because I felt I wasnt ready for the attention. The truth is that I have already been the worlds first trillionaire for a little over a year (and before that I was the youngest billionaire in the world). The $19m Bugatti La Voiture Noire was custom-made as a celebration of me becoming the worlds first trillionaire.

At 21 years old, I am proud to have made these achievements and I look forward to helping change the world in all of the ways Ive imagined and beyond. Regardless of who is currently running for president, I will officially become president of the USA in 2020. My Bel Air mansion on 822 Sarbonne Road was $88,000,000  coincidentally 88 symbolizes eternity which is how long I plan to keep this wonderful home. As a side note, my upcoming rap album will be called Eternal Life.

 Bel Air is the richest neighborhood in the worldone because I live here, and two because it just is. In March 2018, I moved into a humble $4.5M Bel Air home paying a bit over $10,000/month on rent. I am thankful to have now achieved my new $88M dream home which will greatly inspire me to keep doing big things. The art hallway will be filled with paintings by Denise (my fiance) and I. The elevator garages will be filled with my dream cars including my Bugatti La Voiture Noire. 

Kelsey Coin allowed me to become the worlds first trillionaire.  I started Kelsey Coin in December 2017 which has now become the only currency in the world. Over the coming months you will find yourself happy to see financial corruption become a thing of the past. There is a total of 1.2 trillion Kelsey Coin and as more people continue to use Kelsey Coin, I will eventually lose my trillionaire title. Considering I have already become the worlds first trillionaire, I am completely content with giving away the title. I see a beautiful future ahead of us and I hope to inspire the world in a way that has never happened before. ",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Over the years I have obsessed about how to make it easy for every one to build their resume. Using some AI magic, I ended up creating a site (a side project) that allows you to create a resume for free. Heres the link: [https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/](https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/)

I've used [https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn) to generate the text by feeding it data scraped from various resources. My script runs in a ""while true"" loop and generates a new resume every 3-4 seconds. Resume is then saved to S3 and the same resume is loaded via CloudFront for all users.

I plan to make it more and more awesome, like you add your name and designation and it fills up your resume. But, I thought it would be nice to get a feedback from you folks and see if I can add the to my to-do for the side project.

Id the following thoughts on why I started working on it:

\- I knew a guy who got a job at Google, who previously couldnt get a job at an IT agency just cause his resume wasnt good enough

\- Not all of us have the skills required to write creatively and organize it. That doesnt mean you dont qualify for a job

Things like these are weirdly still a hurdle for many (it is going to be 2020 next year!). I want them not to be a hurdle anymore :slightly\_smiling\_face:

So, pitchfork me if you hate what I built, but if you loved it or have any suggestions do share your thoughts with me. Appreciation will make my day, critique will help me shape it.

Startup companies and independent researcher need competitive prices on development, testing, training models and evaluating ideas.

I collected different efficient competitive prices from different GPU rental vendors. 

Some options are bare metal servers, some options are cloud based.

You can see different hardware configurations from different vendors.

Prices are starting from 1 cent / hour only !

Depend on project requirements, you can see different options from different alternative vendors. 

You can check these offers on [http://blog.omeryavuz.gen.tr/tag/gpu/](http://blog.omeryavuz.gen.tr/tag/gpu/)

&gt;At a time when private equity firms face soaring asset prices and heavy competition for deals, advanced analytics can help them derive the kinds of proprietary insights that give them an essential edge against rivals. These emerging technologies can offer fund managers rapid access to deep information about a target company and its competitive position, significantly improving the firms ability to assess opportunities and threats. That improves the firms confidence in bidding aggressively for companies it believes inor walking away from a target with underlying issues.

**Questions:** Does anyone here use their data science skills for private equity research or economics for a consulting firm like Bain? What is that work like? What tools do you use, and how would you recommend someone interested in making a switch to that field? Any recommended resources to learn more about that career path?

**Background:** I currently work as a marketing strategist, Im starting a dual-degree MBA/MS in Business Analytics in the fall with elementary programming and math experience (though I do have an MA in humanities).

How many times, trying to approach Machine Learning, you felt baffled, disoriented and without a real ""path"" to follow, to ensure yourself a deep knowledge and the ability to apply it?

This field is crazily exciting, but being rapid and ""new"" at the same time, it can be confusing to understand what each things means, and have a coherent naming of the things across resources and tutorials.

I recently landed my first internship for a Data Science position in a shiny ML startup. My boss asked me if it was possible to create a study path for me and newcomers, and i've put a lot of efforts to share my 4-5 years of walking around the internet and collecting sources, projects, awesome tools, tutorial, links, best practices in the ML field, and organizing them in a awesome and useable way.

You will get your hands dirty and learn in parallel theory and practice (which is the only efffective way to learn).

The frameworks i've chosen is Scikit-Learn for generic ML tasks and TensorFlow for Deep Learning, and I'll update the document weekly.

No prior knowledge is required, just time and will.

I see people coming from data science or business analytics degrees from schools like MIT, NYU, Carnegie Mellon that do just fine. Obviously these are good programs and there are countless other shitty data science programs not worth their salt. But it's the same thing with degrees in statistics or CS, innit? Yes, the popularity of statistics and CS means these master's programs have been sprouting like rabbits too. It's not just data science. Crappy schools that hastily create these programs for more money will be crappy. It's true of any degree, really.

What should *not* go into it? Any model programs?

Because of my interest and activity in DS, I've been asked by some colleagues to help with putting together this minor. We're a very small university, but we have several excellent math instructors, a few heavily data-sciencey social scientists (I'm one of them), and a few CS instructors. 

An undergrad minor is an odd thing; it's not a Master's program or even a Bachelor's major degree program. Some people enrolling would be adding ""flavor"" to a math or CS degree; others would be trying to increase their marketability or job value in any of a dozen other fields. A minor, IMO, might aspire to offer something to students that actually increases their employability, or makes their career (whatever it turns out to be) more satisfying. As a minor, very few of these students will go on to be ""data scientists."" Of course, we would love to turn this into a full undergrad major program, someday; but the minor has to work, first.

Right now the program proposal (which was rejected by the curriculum committee, partly because of its merits, partly because someone on the committee has strong opinions about everything) is a mix of lower- and mid-level math courses (including one or two stats courses), a few CS courses, a research methods course, and maybe one ""how to work with data"" course. Naturally I think we should have more in the latter two categories (methods and working with data). However, what do I know? What else should we be doing? Are we looking at this wrong? What considerations do we need to keep sight of?

Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. 

So the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.

The second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks 

""Well do you have any ML experience? Because we do a lot of that here.""

Well then maybe you should ask me about the three other ML projects on my resume which you clearly didn't read until you asked me that question. I then started to tell him about one of the ML projects on my resume. He asks a few questions in that annoying way, where interviewers try to poke holes in your work to try to through you off balance. I'm thinking ""Dude I worked on this for a year. I know what I'm talking about."" I answer his questions and he seems satisfied.

He then asks me a few basic ML questions (e.g. explain linear regression and SVMs). I easily answer those. He asks me a coding question, which I also easily answer. Throughout this whole time he's challenging me by asking questions on things that he clearly doesn't understand that well. He tried poking holes in my solutions, usually by saying things that we're just wrong, which led me having correct his understanding of basic things (e.g. What is a random variable). I try my best to do it politely as possible.

He then says that he doesn't have anymore questions and if there's anything I want to ask him. I ask a few basic questions about the company, and we call it a day.

I get feedback today that they're not moving forward because of my lack of knowledge of NLP. Dude didn't even ask me about NLP. If he did he would know I'm pretty freaking knowledgable about it. We ended the interview 15 minutes early, which I don't maybe he could have used to ask me about NLP if it's so important. 

What's really frustrating to me about this is the AI group there is really large and the fact that I had a problem with this interviewer doesn't mean I wouldn't fit. In other situations I would just say ""Well at least I don't have to work with him."" But from talking to the other guy, I think I would have actually fit in really well there, and I just had bad luck by getting this one guy as an interviewer.

From those data, we are connecting the web id to people who are clicking car ads, and we also have marketing campaigns where the company launch cars and people have to register to attend, so we have personal information and connection with web id. And then, we also have data on people who made the booking for the cars. 

So my first thought of course, being a new data scientist in this area (advertising), to make purchase prediction classification algorithm, and then we can derive features importance and then adjust the marketing campaign based on that. But my marketing manager want me to make customer segmentation, so he want several groups based on how eager they are to buy the car. The thing is, we have target class imbalance data. From around 200 thousands personal information and their web activities we track, those who made the booking is only around 4%. 

With algorithm like random forest and XGboost, I can predict who are most likely to buy the car. But how can I exactly do customer segmentation, dividing into several groups based on eagerness to buy, also to see from each group, what kind of interests they have outside of cars from their web activities on e-commerce sites. How do I combine customer segmentation with prediction? Im looking at several customer segmentation techniques and cases but it seems like most of them are based on data when customers have made several purchases. In my case, majority of the people in the database don't make the purchase, so I dont know how to make clustering algorithm based on that.

Kelsey Coin has already become the worlds only currency. With that being said, the USA is the first country to recognize Kelsey Coin as its official currency. During this process, existing banking systems run by companies such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Bank of America, etc. will shut down.

One of the main concerns regarding Kelsey Coins future is system security as we dont use illegitimate concepts such as blockchain. The truth of the matter is that it wont matter. There are many different ways to ensure complete account security and we will take all required measures to do so.

Certain government sectors including the Federal Reserve will no longer have a purpose and therefore will be shut down entirely. I am not concerned regarding any potential lost jobs because Kelsey Coin will stabilize the economy so that petty work is no longer required. Automation of course will aid this process and we need to stop acting like these jobs are necessary.

It is very likely that a number of other countries will recognize Kelsey Coin as their official currency this year but the USA is the only country I can say for certain as of now. It is important to educate the world on how to use Kelsey Coin and its related platforms (World Home and Black Market World). I recently wrote an article that details everything you need to know about Kelsey Coinhere is the link. We will be keeping everyone up to date regarding upcoming Kelsey Coin news.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is the exact right sub for this question--I posted it over in r/jobs as well but I was hoping to get some feedback from people in my field if possible.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering how much flexibility telecommuting employees have as far as where they work from. For some context, I currently live in New York (In Data Science / Analytics) but my SO may be doing a degree program in England. I don't want to fully give up my NY residence if I don't have to, so I'm looking for remote opportunities which would allow me to work from either the US or the UK. My ideal situation is one where I could spend 2 or 3 months at a time in either country, while working remotely full time. Is this possible? Most Remote Data Science opportunities I've seen say something like ""Work from anywhere in the US"" but I'm not sure if this means you can't work outside the country, or just that you need to be based in the US (citizenship, resident, paying taxes etc). I'm born and raised in the US so that wouldn't be an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

So for anybody here with experience in a remote analytics role, were you free to work from wherever you wanted, provided you had a good internet connection and made yourself available during business hours?  

&amp;#x200B;

The course is intended to be 6 months to complete but I have already completed half of course in my first month as a student so it's safe to say I enjoy the data very very much. It makes me happy whenever I do the coursework tbh lol!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm going to start applying for data analyst positions soon and I'm quite worried about my chances of landing my first job because I'm not like most of the other students enrolled in Thinkful's program. Most students are career changers who possess a 4 year college degree. However, my story is quite different, I'm simply a 20 year old who just couldn't afford to finish my 4 year degree due to some family related issues that I won't go into here. (I dropped out during my second year, while studying Statistics at University of South Florida).   

&amp;#x200B;

I really wanted to go into the Finance industry once I was completed finished with Thinkful's Data Analytics course, however, after looking at several finance-related job offerings in my local area (Tampa/St.Petersburg, Florida),  I saw that literally 100% of them required a minimum of a 4 year degree ): 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here believe I have a chance of getting an entry-level position in Finance doing Data Analysis with my background + experience? Also if you think another industry might be better for someone like me please let me know because I'm completely open to working in another industry involving Data Analysis. The only real requirement I have industry wise is room for salary growth because I'm an extremely hard worker and know that I will become a great asset for whatever company I eventually work for.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. average value of a product category, and average cost of acquisition of a product category** 

Here i'm trying to discover categories that are providing good return on their advertising costs, so we can reduce or eliminate

**2. identifying categories or products that we're not getting people visiting on, even though we have plenty of stock**

Here we can start to steer our marketing department to focus on categories or actual products so that we get more eyeballs to those category or product pages

**3. grouping products by average product value** 

such as chairs ($50) desks ($100) and standing desks ($200) - however this is similar to point #1

It was my first interview for a data scientist role and I had to interview with over a dozen people including multiple leaders within the company. Even before I was invited for a face to face interview, I underwent a coding assessment (timed). I usually do not do well in timed challenges as they make me nervous and I can get flustered easily. They rejected me after the assignment (I received the news while I was waiting in the lounge of another company getting ready for my final interviews with the second firm for a Developer role). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But after the rejection, I decided that it wasn't the best assessment of my performance and I took all the feedback the team had for me and re-did the challenge over the course of next week. I reached out to the company again with my results and asked them to reconsider my work (with little expectation). I think the company liked my initiative and they invited me for onsite interviews. I said yes to this since I had another offer for a different role from a startup. My onsite interviews were average at best and shitty at worst. I felt I did not do well and went to bed at 5 in the evening. I could not answer questions from past since most of these questions were from five years ago. During the technical interview, the interviewers were looking for a very specific answer, but I had zero clue on what exactly they were looking for. I felt comfortable defending my work, but that's about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

By next noon, I got the dreaded call from the recruiter and she tells me that they really liked me (very puzzling). They wanted me to do a few more interviews with the team since the team wanted to be sure that I knew my shit. Now, to give you a quick idea about my background, I don't have much data science experience outside of some projects I did while on my free time and my startup which focuses on visual data. So I was pleasantly surprised that the company gave me an offer in like two hours after I finished my final interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I want to thank this community since it would have been pretty difficult to prepare for the interview without some of the posts here. My only advice is, if you have the grit, you can be anything you want.",43,338,False,self,,,,,

So I really value the good mix I get of the communication/collaboration and case based skills I get from the business degree, but I have also been exposed to critical thinking, statistics and cs courses at UW. One thing I learned about myself early on in uni is that I'm actually not great in Math. Probably only statistics because I see its applicability better, but getting down to the theorems, proofs for the pure math classes doesn't interest me nor does it click as easily for me. I've enjoyed learning R, SQL and Python, but I don't have any type of interest to be a developer who knows back-end coding using C++, C#, Java ...etc. 


I was fortunate to have co-op internships at 2 banks and an insurance company, and I have one left to complete this year. I was an IT Business Analyst at one of Canada's big 5 banks, and ngl, it was boring af. Maybe it's because I was a co-op and they gave me the grunt work, but it wasn't enjoyable and a lot of the people I worked with seemed all about themselves and cocky af. I did enjoy working with the Business Intelligence Tool, Tableau, for report building though. My other co-op I was a QA at a bank, and damn that was even more boring. I learned a lot, but didn't enjoy the QA work involving JIRA tickets, solving and testing them in the SIT and UAT environments. Finally, I did a finance/accounting co-op at an insurance firm and enjoyed that the most. The people were friendlier, more analysis, the company value was upbeat and great. But at the end of the day, idk if I'd enjoy the month-end work all the time :/ What I did enjoy though was the project they made the co-ops do where we had to us MS Visio to map out one of the accounting account processes which was really neat and I learned way more from that then the boring month-end tasks I did.


I feel like just settling with Accounting and working towards a CPA because it's a stable career, earnings are decent, and I can grow in the area (side: NOT interested in finance careers involving Capital Markets, equity analyst, IB stuff or actuarial science).  However, I know it's hella boring (based off my last co-op), but if it means financial stability, I'll do it. However, at the same time, I feel like I am doing NOTHING with my Math degree if I take this route, and there's so much more I can do with it as a STEM major. Do you think I should reconsider a different career that utilizes the math degree? A lot of people have told me to consider Data Science, which I am currently researching using this sub but I don't know if I have the skills or competency to make it. I still have 1.5 years of school let, so I am going to try taking more stats or cs courses (any recommendations for other skills to learn would be great). I also have one more co-op to try out something new. I am wondering what type of co-op I should try out?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

for a personal project i am currently messing around with, i would like to access some data that (as far as i know) is only available through a mobile app. For obvious reasons, I would like to avoid the tedious task of manually writing in the data, especially as updates would need to be monitored with a high frequency. Therefore, I am trying to come up with a better solution. Now, if the data i am after were available on a webpage, i would simply try to crawl the webpage and scrap the content that i need. 

I am not as familiar with mobile-apps however, so i am uncertain to what extent this is possible/ feasible.   
The best alternative I could come up with so far is to use an Android-Emulator on my pc and use image based text-recognition.

 However, I believe that automating this process (taking pictures, scrolling through the app, ...) might end up being significantly more time intensive than manually copying out the data (and still require manual operation once it's done).   
Any ideas, suggestions and experiences are much appreciated!

My goal is to eventually be in a VP/Director of Data Science position and recognize I need experience leading a team. Our engineering group uses Agile (loosely) and believe this is common for many companies.

Given that I am looking to make a job change in the next year, should I pay out of pocket to get the Certified ScrumMaster designation ($1K USD and two days of classes)? Would this be a differentiator when interviewing? I'm thinking it may provide signal that I'm committed to developing as a project manager/leader, and also be valuable in its own right. 

And before this gets raised, yes, I understand that my chief value will be based on my core technical skills as a data scientist. I am already heavily invested there.

I'll be completely honest, I have a secret. I avoid visualizing data in my notebooks as much as humanly possible. Python visualization is not smart. I've tried matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, plotly (I actually like plotly but it has it's few problems too), and other random visualization libraries.

It always happens the same way. 
1) I want to visualize some data. 2) I try to use the library in an intuitive way. 3) get an error. 4) fix the error. 5) spend 20 minutes trying to figure out how to resize something or add a label so I can see what's happening.

By the time I end up making something extremely simple, I've now spent 30+ mins on it. And then I start dreading to even touch the next visualization.
Usually at that point I save my data to csv and do my visualization in Tableau.

I achieve more insight in using Tableau (or any other BI tool) for 5 minutes vs trying to negotiate with Python to make a bar chart that's legible for 2 hours. 

Python, overall, is fantastic for data voodoo, but it has a severe problem in the visualization territory. 

Chartify, by Spotify, attempts to tackle that exact problem, but ends up just +1-ing the list of broken visualization libraries like the xkcd comic.

At this point I've kind accepted my fate with viz, I'll only make a viz in my notebooks if there is an absolute need for it.

What if the response are multi-class? For example, there might be different failure modes and I'd like to use those as response. Is regression not possible in this case? (I think there are multi-class logistic regression but it's rarely used...)

It makes the installation of a fully working hub on a Debian or Ubuntu server easy, with everything already installed and compiled (no build tools needed).

The package comes with a fully equipped Python3 kernel  the scientific Python stack and common visualization frameworks are built in. All additional packages beyond the JupyterHub core are organized into setuptools extras. You can select them for inclusion (many are added by default), or remove unneeded ones to reduce the package size, by changing the debian/rules file.

On an Ubuntu / Debian workstation, using this package you get readily available notebooks for personal use, without the need to start a notebook server on the command line every time you want to edit a notebook.

Technically, this is a self-contained Python3 venv wrapped into a Debian package (an ""omnibus"" package, all passengers on board). You can build the package in a Docker container, so that you don't need to worry about installing build dependencies  the Dockerfile does that for you, without affecting your workstation or build host.

For more details, check out the GitHub README (see link above).


Changes since 0.9.4-3:

  * Extras: Added 'docker', 'nlp', 'ml', 'utils', and 'vizjs' (included by default)
  * Extras: Added 'arrow', 'nltk', and 'parquet' (optional)

I have finally received an acceptance letter for a Statistics grad program (yay!), and plan on leaving my company in late summer to go back to school full time.  I currently work as a data analyst for an automotive supplier, and my boss is aware that I will be leaving the company, and he will be working with HR soon to start the process of finding (and potentially using me in part to train) a replacement.  Thankfully, everyone is very supportive.

I was the first person in the company, so far as I am aware of, who does ""data analysis"" and has a statistical background, novice as I am on paper in that matter.  I am not very happy with the way my job is currently structured and would have planned on leaving anyway if I had not gotten an acceptance.  My work is not very well defined; there are data management issues (like storage, access, standardization across sites) which slow work; and I do not have anyone in my company who is able to double check my work from a statistical POVor even more preferably, elevate it to (and appreciate) a higher sophistication.  While officially on a team, I am not on a team of people who do what I do, and am very independent anyway.

I have been asked to help craft a job description for my replacement.  However, while I can easily regurgitate my current responsibilities onto paper and list what skills I have found useful for executing them, I would like to expand this task to communicate back to my employer how best to structure such a job, from hierarchy of needs they should be considering in order to streamline the data analysis process (instead of merely filling roles I have been haphazardly shoehorned into, and ignoring needs which subsume them), to better establishing specific duties to achieve those ends (instead of giving the next person as much autonomy as I have).

I would like to do this, and have come to this community for feedback on how to do so, for two main reasons: (1) I myself need to grow and manage my expectations for what a better data analysis or data science job looks like, and (2) I would like my successor(s) to experience that better if I have some latitude to reform it.

To give a rough outline for what I would like to learn and communicate back to my company, posed as questions:

- **What are the standard vertical and horizontal structures surrounding a technical job like an analyst?**  Right now, I receive work not only directly from my boss, but also often directly from different people in the company (some high up) who are aware of me and the statistical skills I provide.  Sometimes these projects do not have established timelines or well-defined metrics or goals, and this creates disorganization and workload/expectation problems.  After working like this for some time, it seems to me that a wiser system would be for projects to be administered through management, and interactions between groups (such as, a chemical test lab group and my group (myself)) to ultimately start and end from above.  Is this misguided?  How do project management and team interactions work in well-functioning systems?

- With deference to some of the prior considerations, **what sort of environment (have you found) works best for a data analyst to thrive in?**  For instance, I feel that I would have liked to have another person on my team who does what I do so I could bounce ideas off them and assert my own expectations better.  I also feel that the rest of the company isn't very good at managing their own expectations for what a single data analyst can do, and my position as an almost independent service provider within the company speaks to that.  How are data analysis teams organized and how do they manage the request-result cycle?

- **What functions often go underserved in a company starting to sophisticate its data analysis process, and what skills should it seek out to fill those?**  As I mentioned above, there are non-homogeneities in how data is collected and stored and made accessible between different manufacturing or test sites that we have, and some projects that they would want to work on in the foreseeable future will involve more sharing of this data between sites.  Data is often dumped into a ""vault"" specific to each site (with very limited read access), and can be made available in a hodge-podge way on a network we have.  It doesn't seem conducive to accessibility.  I am also woefully underinformed on the full extent of data management at our company, so the problem may just be my level of knowledge; but the prescription nonetheless may be bringing in someone with the skills required to interact with the data we have, even if vaulting and networks are enough.  Who works behind the scenes that a data analyst depends on?  What skills should that person have?

- Finally, **How can I combine the above into job description(s), for employer and prospective employee alike?**  How many people make a good team?  What should they each bring to the table?

These are the things about which I will likely ask more follow up questions.  That may come when I have done some more thorough investigation into what expectations and gaps people in my company find for data analysis.  I also may not be asking the right questions, and I may have different ones depending on the feedback I get here.

Right now though, I think this is my question for this post:

I have a binary classifier that is achieving 50% accuracy on an evenly balanced training set. The 2x2 confusion matrix has 50% of the samples in all 4 quadrants. So the model is having trouble separating the two classes and is essentially guessing. I selected 200 features that seemed particularly relevant out of the 600. After retraining I still get 50% accuracy but now looking at the confusion matrix, the model is nearly always (&gt; 90% of the time) classifying events into the negative class. Now in the total training set, this would actually result in a high accuracy model (98% of examples are negative) but during training I've downsampled the negative class. 

&amp;#x200B;

My intuition is that if the model is having trouble separating the two classes, why is it always guessing one over the other? Why doesn't it randomly predict events into both classes. Just for reference, the matrix looks like:

.1 .9

I want to discuss about something that is itching me right now.   


I recently posted in the weekly Entering thread. I am a student in mathematics and computer science who is studying to become a data scientist. I am currently learning C++ by myself and was told to transition to Python ASAP. I was reading a Data Structures and Algorithms book (in C++) during that time (and still am, spoiler!)

&amp;#x200B;

So I did my DD and told myself why not learn that subject in Python to learn the language at the same time? There's where it became more problematic. I understand fully that for someone who wants to become a data scientist, Python is mandatory since it has these beautiful libraries for machine learning &amp; co. But the problem I faced is that when I wanted to implement my own data structures in Python, I realized that so much is done under the hood that it's pretty much impossible to get an in-depth understanding on what is happening, and to optimize stuff on ""my way"".   


So my question goes as follow : Since optimizing is a huge part in a data scientist job, and playing with data structures/optimizing algorithms is also so important, why is it not pushed more to get a core undestanding of it? I understand you can use stuff that you don't understand completely, but for someone who's JOB is to use it, shouldn't he understand at least the fundamentals?   


I want to hear your opinions!  


PS: Just to be sure, I am not ranting on Python, I am saying it's hader to get a grasp on the core because it's all done out of sight. I am not saying C++ is better either, I am asking why people do not recommend to learn a lower level language (any!) before learning Python.

Im a BSN grad from a developing country who is currently working as a medical coder.

Im interested in data science due to the ability to work from home with higher pay. Im also interested in the application of data science in mental health &amp; dermatological research, which have been something of an interest to me. I always enjoy reading research studies, which I sometimes do for medical coding when necessary.

I am not the best at math. I did well in algebra (A-) but okay-ish (B-) in statistics. There was no calculus when I went to college. Honestly, Ive forgotten a lot of math stuff already (my job doesnt use a lot of math) so Im not sure how Id fare with heavier math topics.

I know HTML and CSS (learned on my own). The former was easy and fun. The latter was more challenging and enjoyable. I know HCPCS, CPT &amp; ICD-10 CM &amp; PCS codes.

You've heard heaps of stories of people from all over the world trying to enter the field because it's hyping right now. I am one of them (very selling).

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to marketing data analysis field almost accidentally, as I needed it to work on the analysis to get Permanent Residence in another country. However, I got really into it!  Before that I use to work as a Digital Marketing Manager for 10 years and was way far away from any kind of serious analysis. Even thinking of doing excel visualisation was giving me chills.  However, I have very good understanding of marketing, strategy and digital marketing in particular, as I helped many brands to become better.

&amp;#x200B;

I started with Datastudio, Google Analytics. Was a parrot doing reports and visualisations, but people found it nice. After my documents situation resolved, I could go whatever, but stayed in marketing analysis. Started to do R and a bit of Python, learn Tableau. Learned stats basics required for proper ab test analysis -&gt; distribution, p-value, KS tests and Bootstrap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have an aspiration to move into data science to develop detailed analysis skills and move into predictions/forecasting. Still a long way to go though - full of time/money investments into courses/tutors even to cover basic stats (i.e. k-means, regressions, etc.). 

 

What's the realistic probability of someone like me to get into the field,  if you don't have the capacity to spend all your mornings/days/nights for next 2 years and keep your family? How's my perspective looks like for all of you with fancy PhDs and BS in statistics/maths/research/engineering?  Should I really invest my effort, or my absolute maximum considering all the above is to become an average loser and just waste years of my life?

Not sure what kinda jobs to apply for that could combine my previous work experience with what I do now. I'm happier with what I do now, but I keep thinking that perhaps I should have just went for a management master or an urban planning master or something like that that was more directly related to my work experience. Looking back, that idea was depressing to me and I wanted something else entirely. But I'm here now, not getting any younger and I've spent all my savings. It gets to me sometimes that I'm broke now while others that were in my Civil Engineering class back in the day are now specialized and prolly got tons of savings.

We received some very brief on site training a couple of months ago from Dataself when we upgraded and I was told by the trainer and a developer at Dataself how impressed they are with my reports and what I have taught myself to do thus far. I want to take my training to the next level so that I can build the visual dashboards everyone has been looking and asking for. I would also like to build in Dataself a Dashboard the monstrous report I built from the data I exported out of Dataself and into Excel.

I need a change in my career and looking for some advice on how to successfully pivot.  I've been working mostly as a financial analyst for about 5-6 years now in both private and government organizations. I have an undergraduate degree in applied psychology and a masters in public administration concentration of financial management. Not the greatest credentials but I've made the most of it (suffered from not knowing what I want to do, go figure!). I've always enjoyed dabbling in programming, statistics, and working with large data sets so that's where I ultimately want to end up.  

Problem for me is my degrees don't really help me get my foot in the door for data science/analytics. My professional experience I know Excel well enough (pivots tables, basic vba/macros). Know basic SQL and that's about it. I feel stuck in that I don't have a defined and robust skill set to move upwards. I want to develop one in data science/analytics.  

Naturally I started looking into programs to start building a plan of action and I've narrowed it to 3 options and want to know your thoughts. 

1) self educate using codeacademy and the like. It's cheaper for sure but the big negatives for me on this is I do MUCH better learning in a structured environment and I don't think companies will pay much attention to ""self taught"" data analysts compared to others with certs/degrees.  

2). Data Science Bootcamp through Northwestern/Trilogy. I'm sure most of you know about these. I understand the hesitation for these ""diploma mills"" but I've heard good things about Northwesterns program in particular. This would give me a good understanding of data analysis principles/techniques and allow me to have a certificate which, hopefully, carries some weight coupled with my professional experience in finance. Pros it's 6 months which is shorter than my 3rd option. Access to Northwesterns alumni/career network? Cons, you only get out of it what you put in and it still may not be enough to get me hired in the field?

3) Georgia Tech Online Masters of Data Science. This is an option I kinda like. It's cheaper than any other masters program I've found for online data science. It's freaking Georgia Tech. Cons, time commitment, it'll take 2-3 years and I have to take an intro to python class before applying. This option seems the hardest/longest road but could set me up the best?  

Idk my thoughts are all over. Just looking for some advice or help on creating an action plan to pivot my career towards data analytics.  Thank you for reading and any and all help is greatly appreciated :)

I'm doing a little project in text analytics and part of it was scraping all of the submissions and comments from r/Conservative, r/Libertarian, r/Liberal, r/Anarchism, and r/communism from November 2017 to October 2018. It's a full year of data and I've actually cleaned it up a bit, but I'm happy to share the raw files if anyone is interested.

This is a technical book about popular ""non-classical"" space-efficient data structures and fast algorithms that are extremely useful in modern Big Data applications including data and stream mining tasks. 

It covers the state of the art algorithms and data structures that help to handle such common problems in Big Data processing as *membership querying*, *counting*, *stream mining*, and *similarity estimation*.

* **Membership querying** (Bloom filter, Counting Bloom filter, Quotient filter, Cuckoo filter).
* **Cardinality** (Linear counting, probabilistic counting, LogLog, HyperLogLog, HyperLogLog++).
* **Frequency** (Majority algorithm, Frequent, Count Sketch, Count-Min Sketch).
* **Rank** (Random sampling, q-digest, t-digest).
* **Similarity** (LSH, MinHash, SimHash).

While it is impossible to cover all the existing amazing solutions, this book is to highlight their common ideas and important areas of application. 

The book is available in both E-book and paperback formats. You can get a free preview and all related information about the book at [**https://pdsa.gakhov.com**](https://pdsa.gakhov.com/) or directly at Amazon, of course.

**Boring explanation for people who've never watched**

For the Non-US among us, March Madness is an annual basketball tournament similar to the knockout stages of football (single-elimination) that is used to determine the best college basketball team in the country  (think of it like UEFA Champions league but much more compressed in terms of timeframe). Since college basketball teams play in separate conferences (think domestic leagues), there is no way to claim bragging rights of the best team in the country. It's referred to as madness because the tournament takes place over 2 weeks and anything can happen (like giant-slayers in the FA cup if you're a Brit).

This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, heres a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Dont send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - youll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[persons name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and Im an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

Im reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after theyve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they dont respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If youve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if youd be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isnt absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If youve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you wont make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if youve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and youre ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. Theres a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If youre not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. Thats what will ultimately start you on your journey.",38,143,False,self,,,,,

Luckily it is full time with good benefits but the experience I'm gaining is not particularly great and it's not very enjoyable either. The money is not good and that is a very legitimate concern of mine. I have a business degree with a niche specialization that is non-tech and non-STEM.

I'd like to get into programming or data. I've thought the best way to do this may be to go get a second degree in Computer Science with a lot of math mixed in. This is because virtually all of the data analysis or even broader tech jobs in my area are asking for a CS degree, a CS degree with experience, or a engineering or business degree with experience. I'd like to make a more long-term play as opposed to a quick job change for slightly better money, because I'm single and don't have many obligations so I can. The reasons driving this idea are that I want to make a better salary and I want something that feels more important and fulfilling.

I've learned python in my spare time over the past few years and like it. I haven't got very far but have learned some web scraping, pandas, making classes, etc. I've also done the edx Intro to CS with Python course and am currently doing a Udacity Intro to Data Analysis with Python.

My questions are:

1. You read about and hear from people who have done the small online courses or who are self-taught and get tech jobs eventually. Does this type of route lead only to lower-level or entry-level jobs? Is this really a good approach or is it a bit of a desperate hail-Mary? Will these people top-out and some point and need better math skills or CS knowledge to progress in their careers? Perhaps it's better to go all-in with a CS degree if you're able (I know people have families, financial limitations of course) so you can continue progressing in the industry?

2. Can you eventually make good money (like the 60-90k range) if you're only self-taught? Do the coding skills alone allow you to work into higher pay grades or do you need more theory?

3. What types of projects can someone interested in data science do as part of an application portfolio? Is a portfolio still a useful tool for a data applicant or is that more for programming?

4. Do you need to be a math genius or genius in general to be successful in data analysis and data science?

5. In a data analysis role, what is the importance of statistics skills vs coding skills? Is statistics far more important and coding just a minimum requirement?

6. For someone who has the ability to do so, is a second degree in CS the best way to get into the data science/analysis field with no related education or experience?

7. Is there anyone who has gone for a 2nd degree at approximately age 30 who is glad they did or who regrets it?

However I am realizing that not only salaries will be significantly lower in France (we're talking 3x lower), but the prospect do not look so exciting from a DS perspective ([e.g](https://e.gl). archaic corporations who look for data analysts, or startups who use words like ""neural networks"" in every sentence).

I have tried everything from upsampling, downsampling, and even SMOTE. I've also used GridSearchCV for my models and set class\_weights = 'balanced' and tested custom ones as well. Weighting {0:2, 1:1} actually works best.

It seems like the optimal evaluation metric is the f1 score. I've also looked at precision, recall, auc. The best I can do is a Random Forest with an f1 score for my minority class of .48 and for my majority class of .92. 

Is this good enough?

I am trying to teach myself how do marketing mix models as there is a position open in my company that does this that id like to move into.  For reference,  the marketing mix models show the effect of advertising spend by channel on sales.

**Data**

The dataset consist of 62 variables all at a weekly level for the last 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Detailed Data overview**

\-Weekly sales

\-Advertising spend by channel (weekly).  so I have a variable for facebook spend, tv spend, etc.  For a total of 7 advertising variables

\- Around 50 variables that are either macroeconomic or shows information about competitors

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Related information**

&amp;#x200B;

I know about Advertising adstock and have spent a long time learning that. So, Im good there. I also have taken seasonality into account.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

The goal is to obviously show the effect of advertising spend by channel on sales.  so, I have to use those 8 variables.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do I balance between adding over variables vs hiding the effect of advertising spend by using over powering macroeconomic variables?

&amp;#x200B;

2) What do I do if it shows an advertising spend variable has a negative coefficient?  How do I interpret that? Like obviously, spending money didn't on facebook ads didn't hurt sales.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

For some background on my education and experience;
I am a student at a top 20 university studying Computational Cognitive Science in which uses techniques drawn from computer science to formalize and mechanize mental functions observed in neuroscience and psychology. Thus I have knowledge in the history, theory and practice of A.I, ML and so forth. I can program proficiently in Python, R  and SQL. I have taken a course on introductory Data Science and it was perhaps my most fun and successful course throughout my university degree. I have also taken roughly 10 online courses in Data Science and have several small projects in my portfolio. I am also doing an internship this summer as an A.I programmer.

Although I do have the basic university linear algebra, calculas and statistics my fear is that I won't be able to compete against a statistics or math major and so I want to pursue a graduate degree in Data Science.

&amp;#x200B;

We are working on our final business project, and we have (as business/management students) been asked to help a global hearing device company investigate data science/AI/machine learning methods for predicting what technology to develop in future consumer earphones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, the hypothesis is that the company has a lot of data from customer reviews, sales, feedback, internal team analysis etc. that could contain information about what future trends could look like. Currently there are no structure to how this data is handled at all. The hope is that data analysis can help them to direct which technologies to develop three years in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our initial research points us in the direction of various sentiment analysis, neural network, NLP etc. However, we would also like to find some more applied results, such as 

&amp;#x200B;

1) find more examples of companies that have successfully used and applied these techniques for technology prediction/forecasting

2) learn more about consultancies that are top-of-the-class in implementing such solutions

3) understand whether their request is totally impossible given the technologies today (since future is impossible to predict, this is probably true...)

&amp;#x200B;

We would of course also be happy to hear if you know of some other technologies that could be useful that we didn't mention...a bit of technical and academic aspect is still important!

I'm trying to visualize the license plate and windshield registration and inspection sticker laws of the 50 States + DC. I have a table that provides this info, and I thought a choropleth map would be a good way to visually and cleanly summarize this info, but it's complicated by a number of factors. Here's what I've captured:

* Which states are rear plate only (19 of them)
* How many stickers are required on the rear plate 
* How many stickers are required on the front plate
* How many stickers are required on the windshield 
   * For each of these, they vary between 0, 1, and 2.

My initial thought before I went to the computer was to indicate which states are rear plate only, and then use a color gradient that gets darker for each of those variables. (Each is one color, and has between 2 or 3 levels of color that gets darker as more stickers are needed).   


I'd prefer not to have a different map for each variant (one for front plate laws, one for rear plate laws, one for windshield, and one for rear-only), but since most states are unique, there's no easy way to capture all of this information on one map.  


Is a choropleth the best visualization to use? If not, what is? What are your recommendations?

Here is a screenshot of a rudimentary draft that was just to help begin the design process.

Long story short: I am a Data Scientist that works for a fortune 500 company in Brazil, and wants to relocate to Europe, but would need sponsorship because I only have Brazilian citizenship. Was a software engineer that transitioned to DS and I work with text mining right now. 

I would like to have some advice on what I should focus on next to maximize my chances of getting a Data Scientist position to relocate to Europe. There are a lot of different fields to work on and I feel kind of lost on how to proceed. 

Since Europe is very big, the options that I envision are:

- The Netherlands
- Germany
- UK
- Ireland
- Switzerland
- Belgium looks good as well, but I would need to study this country a little more to decide. 

Any one of them would be good, since I know that relocating inside Europe is easier once you're there, in case I'm not compatible with my first option. Also, I'm not picky about salary, having enough to pay the bills and eating out two times a week is enough for me, I know I can build upon my opportunity with time. 

I think it's important to give you details about my background, so that you have more information to work with. 

### My background

What I can do:

3+ years experience with software engineering before switching to Data Science so the programming, SQL, NoSQL and ETL stuff is a no brainer to me. I know how to deploy math models using Python and also know infrastructure, docker, Linux, Kubernetes, scalability, networking, etc etc. (I worked as a sysadmin for a year)

I am working with document classification for 1 year already, using TF-IDF + SVM + regex rules. I also do metadata extraction from the text (client name, document id, etc). I have hands-on experience with random forests, logistic regression, NaiveBayes, etc, the standard stuff for text mining. Classification is one of my strengths. 

I know how to explain these complicated concepts to business people, one of my presentations to a C-level executive on how word vectors could be used for a problem made me receive very good feedback from him. 

I am responsible for understanding the problem with the business people so that I can know which problem to be solved first to have better results to then solve it using ML/DL/whatever solves it, I also make the decisions on how the problem will be approached. 

I also know quite a bit about sentiment analysis, since it's what I do in my spare time. 

What I cannot do:

I don't know R (it would be easy to learn R, but I got lazy in that part, Python looks way simpler)

I just have very basic and  theoretic knowledge of regression, that part of DS is not used in my job because I do classification, so I never got past that famous real estate dataset.

I also have very basic and theoretic knowledge of clustering, I know it is very useful for profiling customers, recommendation and all that, but didn't get past KNN and K-Means examples, just the basics. 

My statistics kinda suck. I'm working on that right now by learning on online courses and trying to apply it to hypothesis testing in my work. But I still struggle with how to use random sampling, the exact meaning of confidence interval, p-value, F-test, T-test, etc etc. This is one area that I don't feel confident about. 

My math is not that strong as well, I struggle to understand the underlying maths on state of the art papers. But I don't know if knowing the obscure details of CNNs helps more than being good at using them in a practical setting (avoid overfitting, for example). 

My question is, based on my strengths and weaknesses, what skills should I focus on to have a bigger chance of getting a DS position in Europe? Customer clustering, A/B testing? Financial stuff? Object detection using CNN? Time series forecasting ? Should I stay in text mining and be VERY GOOD at it and search for positions in that field? Or should I know a little bit about everything and pray that it is enough to land the job, to then get very good at something ? 

Will a masters in science help me on getting a sponsored visa position? Or is it more about what I can / cannot do in practice, instead of academic success? 

I have a B.Sc in Computer Science BTW. 

My favorite area of study is computer vision, but I don't see a lot of job postings about it.  ",8,4,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently a senior graduating in December with a dual degree in Applied Mathematics (focusing on statistics) and Computer Science.  In addition to this, I've messed around with small projects using data from Kaggle and UCI. Just basic classification stuff at this point as well as a little bit of NLP through sentiment analysis. Overall, I've been very enthusiastic about my future and have gained a lot of confidence when it comes to programming, but I'm currently pessimistic in my ability to do ""data science"" and don't know how to get past this wall.

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously have a background that's suitable for data science, but I currently feel like a ""poser"" as anything I've done up to this point just feels shallow/simple. A basic classification model can be created in less than 10 lines in python with zero thought at the process. Even a more thorough approach involving pre-processing data, cross validation, and comparing different models can be done in 100 lines of code or less with very little thinking besides maybe understanding all the ideas that go into cross validation and processing ugly data. I don't even know what exactly data science as it's become this buzzword of sorts as you all know. What are the main concepts or fields of data science? A simple answer like computer science + statistics isn't what I'm asking.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to ask is what exactly does it take to be a data scientist in the real world? I understand it's saturated by the highly educated which does make it highly competitive.

I am trying to understand if I should use a GraphDB for my project. I am mapping a computer network and I use NetworkX. The relationships are physical or logical adjacency (L2 and L3) . In the current incarnation my program scans the network and dumps the adjacency info in a Postgress RDB. From there I use Python to build my graphs using NetworkX.

I am trying to understand if I should change my approach and if there is any benefit in storing the info in a GaphDB. Postgress has AgensGraph which seems to be built on top of Postgress as a GraphDB overlay or addon. I don not know yet if installing this on top will make my life easier. I barely survived the migration from SQLite to Postgress :-) and to SQLAlchemy so now in not even 3 months I am reconsidering things while I can (the migration is not complete)

I could chose to use a mix but I am not sure if it makes sense to use a GraphDB. From what I understand these has advantages as not needing a schema (which helps a lot for a DB newbie like me)

I am also wondering if NetworkX (Python librayr) and GraphDB overlap in any way. As far as I understand these things NetworkX could be instrumental in analyzing the topology of the graph while GraphDB is mainly used to query the data stored in the DB. Do they overlap in anyway?

Background: Undergrad in Finance, low gpa 2.6 

Professional Experience: 3 years at large Bank. Started as Intern, moved to Associate Business Analyst, and recently promoted to Business Intelligence Analyst.
Ive worked on Projects in Tableau, SQL, and Intermediate Python projects using Pandas and Numpy libraries.

-currently enrolled in Calc 2 since schools seem to need this as a prerequisite, but I believe I will only get a C in the class. Wondering if I should retake the class to get a better grade....
-plan to take Intro to Python over the summer
-Plan to Audit Linear Algebra class
-Take GRE, some schools say that a strong GRE score can bolster an application. 
-Letter of reccomendations from Manager, and Vice Presidents

&amp;#x200B;

**Aim**: to develop a model (with online and offline parts), that indicates what the price should be to optimize/manage revenue.  

&amp;#x200B;

**sub-aims**: Am i on the right track? what errors are there in my thinking? Which process to use? What additional reading do I need to do.  By writing this all out I aim to organize my thinking/current understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My background**: I knowledge and experience is in psychology and statistics.  I have started learning Data Science (DS) to enhance these skills.  I have some experience with re-built DS packages, like Microsoft's ML studio.   I am starting with the Hotel model as there seems to be already a lot of work in this area. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What variables to I have access to**: Past booking data (with sub categories like length of stay), past price data and competitor prices. I also may have access to revenue data. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Methodology**:  There seems to be a couple of options. MML studio, DS model or Literature Model.  

&amp;#x200B;

MMLS: My knowledge so far for this is around the standard classification, regression and clustering. Neither seem to fit an optimization situation. Secondly, where would you put competitor pricing? It could be considered a feature but that doesn't seem quite right.  I could see using a model to predict future demand, which could be useful. 

&amp;#x200B;

DS model: (Here)\[[https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134735/what-is-a-good-model-for-revenue-managment-price-optimization-problem](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134735/what-is-a-good-model-for-revenue-managment-price-optimization-problem)\] is an example I found online.  Which I could see being adapted to a multiple predictor model.  The problem I currently have with this is How is the revenue optimization happen? Is there just as assumption that higher the price the more revenue? How are competitor pricing incorporated in to this model?

 

Literature Model: The aim here would be to find an example in the literature and use that to build a model. (Here)\[[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258237934\_Dynamic\_pricing\_for\_hotel\_revenue\_management\_using\_price\_multipliers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258237934_Dynamic_pricing_for_hotel_revenue_management_using_price_multipliers)\] is one report that is particularly interesting.  Using this as an example, models from the literature appear to be far more complex.  My current understanding of this generally is that these are models that get run multiple times (or use distributions) to find the one the best desired outcome and use that to determine the best price. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Challenges:** while there a quite a few.  A couple of articles mention a report that warns of long term revenue loss if you are not careful. Unfortunately, I don't have that link on me.

I graduated last May with a Math degree and a minor in computer science. I have learned a little bit of R and a decent amount of Java. But I feel like I need to learn more data science. I was considering doing an online Masters at Johns Hopkins (part time) and found that they have an online Coursera program that teaches ruby, SQL, and some other things. This program is around 10 months as opposed to the probably 4 years it would take me to get my masters while working. Also, Coursera is only $50/month as opposed to about $50k in tuition.

So my question is, is it worth getting my masters or would I be able to start applying for entry level jobs with the qualifications I get from this Coursera class? Ill post a link to the class below. Thanks in advance for all the help.

I just graduated college and am taking at least 1 gap year to try and decide what to do. So I am learning more data science and building up my portfolio in the meantime while I decide whether to jump into the job market or go to grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's because I was a pure science major, but the amount of DS-related jobs out there which are specifically linked to the marketing part of a company... deter me. Some part of me has a strong ethical pull to want to avoid these roles, because it has this bad taste of exploiting customers through pushing ads. To me, the idea feels like in those roles I'd be one of the bad actors, because I would hypothetically be making predictions to guide these sort of initiatives. (Maybe some of you can tell I've read *Future Ethics* recently.) But it also feels like it's a role where I wouldn't really be doing any particular good for the world even if I ignore the bad. Just making rich people richer.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I searching for these jobs incorrectly? Should I be looking in a particular sector? Or do I have to go back into science in order to avoid these types of roles? Any insight into ways I could avoid that type of work would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I majored in physics and chemistry, so I've thought of going into materials engineering (particularly toward environmentally sustainable materials). And so in choosing to study data science in the mean time I haven't diverted myself away from that path. But I'm wondering if there are types of roles which would better fit my ethical principles. I've even thought about doing software engineering since I go to hackathons a lot, and building applications, even if they're sold and marketed, is in the area of the company less focused on the monetary/marketing aspect. I've just hesitated going into academia because of the slower pace and this feeling that I will pigeonhole myself into working on one thing my whole life (a thing I'm not 100% sure of).

I'm really interested in business, entrepreneurship, startups, etc.; really in any capacity that has to do with creating growth. However, I want to go to get my degree and I want to study something truly valuable (no offense to business majors, I used to be one). I'm fascinated by the thought of solving business problems and creating growth with the use of data, which is what brings me here.

Essentially, I can't decide whether to major in CS, Stats &amp; Analytics, or go with the interdisciplinary route that would allow me to combine a mixture of both for a ""Data Science"" curriculum. I also don't want to have a course load that is too overwhelming (""Data Science"" seems like it would be) because I know how important personal projects are, and I also want some sort of social life.

I think that for me, the major in Stats &amp; Analytics with a minor in business would make the most sense; however, I worry that I would be limited to ""data analyst"" positions after graduation, which seem to come with underwhelming salaries, despite the rigor of the program. Not to knock on data analysis, because I think that's actually what I'm referring to with my goal in business that I mentioned above, but data is such a horribly defined field.

In the Stats &amp; Analytics program, I would pick up on Python, R, SQL, and Excel. I'd continue to develop those skills in my free time with side projects and extracurricular involvement, but is that all data analysis is? There's a YouTuber (JomaTech) that works (maybe worked) for Facebook as a ""Data Scientist""; he had a degree in CS, but was basically only utilizing the skillset that I listed above for work, and he was making over six figures. Salary mainly concerns me because I want to move to NYC after I graduate, and at the moment, Glassdoor has ""Data Analyst"" at an average of 71k, with a median somewhere in the mid 60s. It just seems to me like reasonable proficiency those skills would command higher compensation than that, but obviously I have no clue because the field is so undefined.

**TL;DR:** Should I major in CS, or stats and analytics (still get Python, R, SQL &amp; Excel)? Do I try to rig together a DS major?

I retrained specifically for this and was super excited to get offered the position.  A year later, the position has not lived up to expectations and I am deeply unhappy.  Having never worked elsewhere as a data scientist Im not sure if its just my company though.

For most of the time Ive been here I have not had any work to do.  I feel like Im massively underutilised, and I do nothing of value.  When I actually have a project to work on, I spend most of my time aimlessly trying to create ML models when in reality the data I have does not fully explain the values Im trying to predict.  I have no deadlines, so I have no pressure to model quickly.  Nothing Ive done goes into production.  Ive stretched what should be week to fortnight-long projects into months because I have nothing to do.  Ive literally had only 6 half-projects since Ive been here.  I feel like Im trying to find things to pass the time with, and its really starting to affect my mental health.  I like to be kept busy.

Also, none of the data scientists collaborate on projects, were all assigned our own work, which I feel is possibly not the norm.  It's really lonely, and I feel projects would get done a lot more quickly if we worked together.  We also never have code or project reviews, so I have no idea if what Im doing is correct or not.  I taught myself to code in the language we use so honestly my code is probably horrendous.

Ive tried to find my own projects, but its such a large and global company that its difficult to know where to start.  When I have managed to create my own projects, its taken MONTHS to get the data, so I just sit around waiting.  In the absence of anything else to do, I've been teaching myself web development.

Its got to the point where Im really considering changing to a software engineering/developer role as I really enjoy coding, and I feel like software engineering is an inherently more interesting and collaborative role.  Is it?

Is my experience typical for a Data Scientist, or is it just my company?  Should I try moving to a data science position elsewhere before abandoning it completely?

Some background information: I am a Junior at a top #20 Computer Science school. At the moment, I am looking for a Data Science internship for the summer (as well as preparing for full time) and am having a some trouble. This semester is when I began truly diving into ML and Data Analysis classes and interest in general. I have a good amount of academic projects on my github, but have done no personal projects yet. I am actively building my academic projects and am taking Data Science and AI courses that allow me to do so up until graduation next Spring. My schooling up to this point has focused mostly on programming projects. Therefore, I have tons of things that I believe are good for software engineering positions but my passion is Data Science. I have done a lot of learning on my own this past semester and with my Data Sci and AI class I am learning tons of good ML and Data Analysis basics. My portfolio will grow within the next few months due to the projects that I am doing in my current classes. I also have a few questions in addition to any resume critique: 

1. Should I also be working towards getting professional certifications? For example, will an AWS Cert be beneficial when applying for full time positions?
2. Should I include some of my academic projects on my resume? Along with this, should I be working on doing more personalized projects that relate to Data Science?
3. At the moment, I have been applying for data science internship positions. I have not had much success with this, and it could be due to my resume or me not presenting my experience. If I am not able to secure a position this summer, would you recommend a 10 week rigorous data science course? This course is accredited and I personally know Data Scientists that have gone on from this course to work as Data Scientists at big companies.

&amp;#x200B;

I work with text mining and the most important model that I have is a document classifier. It classifies if a particular document is a contract or not.

&amp;#x200B;

My team created a pipeline that fetches documents, OCR them, classify them and make them available in a web application, so that our users can find them way faster than by using the other methods.

&amp;#x200B;

The classifier was trained with 1K documents and deployed with &gt; 90% F-score to production (I did the training, testing and validation stuff to prevent overfitting). We then needed to tell the stakeholders our classification accuracy, because of that, I sampled 1K from the 33K classified documents and we manually annotated the sample so that we could calculate the number of contracts labeled as not contracts (false negatives) and the number of documents that were not contracts but were classified as contracts (false positives).

&amp;#x200B;

I then looked at the false positives and false negatives for patterns, after finding patterns in the errors, I created regular expressions that reduced the error for some patterns, and re-trained the models for the other patterns that came from new documents that were entirely different from the samples we had in the initial dataset. After updating the model, the F-score went up to &gt; 90% again, and we got better results when looking in the web application, so the problem of performance was solved. BUT, I think my approach to this problem was very intuitive and not very science-y, so I figured out another way of doing this, a more statistical way.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm thinking about doing in the next time, is to make a \[sample size calculation\]([https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm)) using the total of documents in production as the population, confidence level of 95% percent and confidence interval of 3%. Then do a random sample of N documents, annotate them and calculate the F-score.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my fellow data scientists, I would like to know how you do this kind of performance monitoring for classifiers. Also, do you think that my idea has any flaw ?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, my new idea will use a confidence interval of 3%, does that imply that the score that I calculate after annotating documents from my random sampling will have a range of +- 3% ? For example if I calculate a F-score of 94%, does it mean that my F-score, actually is 91-97%, because I did a sample of the population ? Or am I oversimplifying things and this is not how confidence intervals actually work ?

So, like a lot of people on this page, I'm interested in transitioning to a career in data science. I graduated with degrees in biology and comp sci. in 2017, and have been working jobs in biological research since then. Long story short, I used to think I wanted to go to grad school for bio - but not so much anymore. I'm thinking about transitioning into data science, and was looking for some advice on the best way to do so. I have a few options:

1. Leave this job in the upcoming months, learn/build as much as I can in the meantime, and then apply for jobs in the Fall.
2. Stay at this job for a while, where I have the potential to complete a master's very inexpensively (like maybe 350$ from harvard extension school), but it would take a while (at least a year and a half)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the crux of my question lies in whether I would have more luck with the Master's, but very little professional experience, or from maybe taking a more entry level job and building professional experience. For reference, my current job is mostly wet lab-biology focused, but I do get to explore and handle some large genetic datasets - so I would be able to list that as experience. ",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I keep going back and forth on ""if I'm qualified enough"" or not. There's 1 position I really have in mind while writing this post, and it's for a seemingly awesome company that I looked at after completing my MS several years ago.

Even though my title is ""senior bioinformatics scientist"", I feel like I'm not a scientist? I feel like I do so much engineering work and data cleaning and the science part is actually so minimal. The job requirements always want you to be an ""expert"" in linear regression (which honestly is easy af), random forest models (I've been exposed to these and worked with them, but I can't rattle off every thing about them and if I had to build one from scratch I would rip off an existing function/library and then modify to get my desired results) and some graphical models (which I have honestly not had experience with at all).

I have looked at other people that have the same title and they seem to have a BS in math or something similar from very impressive schools. 

I feel like I maybe could do really well at these jobs, but I currently work with 90% PhD's and then think I just never know enough around statistics and models. I can work with them, I can sit in front of a computer for 8-12 hours a day and grind until I get a decent answer, go back to my group and talk about it, then repeat. 

But I don't know if I have the innate knowledge to rattle off a bunch of jargon on how all of these things work inside-and-out. 

I look at other people with these jobs and think, I can definitely compete with these people easily. But then I read the job description and feel like I am majorly lacking.

So Ive been in a pre-datascience type role for about 3 years now  2 of which post college. Ive been self-learning a lot of my skills, so Ive been through tons of ups and downs of modeling. Ive noticed a lot of the valleys in my career in some way may have been due to the nature of my job. 

I wear a bunch of hats. Im a typical business analysts sometimes, a software developer other times, but my main role is Supply Chain Scientist. I just go by Logistics Engineer more often than not. My role revolves around having the ability to provide our customers with transportation optimization, network optimization, and simulation models. As an added bonus we provide forms of automation, reporting, etc. 

Back to the peaks and valleys of my models and my career. Ive noticed that things will tend to get a bit rough when I go from one hat to another. For example I ended off 2018 building a web application (most recently a pricing tool for 100+ employees). I worked on that for roughly 6 months. I immediately jumped into a new project that involved engineering data for a transportation model that provides a customer with insights they cannot in any way derive today. I then modeled that data and concluded. Without getting into too much of the details, there is a component of their operations that they outsource and decided to monitor very little of it, so they have very little data representing a chunk of their business.

This project had an extremely unrealistic timeline, but ideally I usually get done enough of the level of quality and the quantity thats expected of me by now in my career so that we have something to, at the least, work with in case deadlines cant be met. It wouldnt do it justice to just throw this out there with little context, but screw it. This engineering project was scoped for 2 weeks (80 of my hours). From pre-data acquisitions to presenting a conclusion along with visualizations. It was expected to go from absolute vacuum to full blown consulting engagement in 2 weeks. I ended up working on average 95hr weeks for 4 weeks. For reference a similar engineering project I had worked on a year prior was scoped for 3 months.

I made silly mistakes trying to rush through everything and adjust quickly whenever scope shifted, and a good chunk of the mistakes should have been avoided. Im really disappointed in myself, but moving forward I want to prevent this from happening. The idea is that if I can better document the process for typical modeling, automate/pre-program functions to aid each step, and provide myself and others with whatever else well all have the ability to transition from one project to another without skipping a beat.

My process:
View each set of data in excel (if structured)
Compile a formatted file representing the type of model Ill be building (I.e shipment data flattened for trans opt.)
Run a bunch of pre-programmed initial checks on the data and review with the customer
Run typical exclusions if validates by customer
Run typical assumptions if validated by customer
Review status of project and work done
Continue wrapping up pre-model work


I use python, Jupyter notebooks, and build my own packages &amp; modules whenever its necessary. This is usually 99% of my pre-modeling environment. If its not a custom solution, we aim to use Supply Chain Guru X. Otherwise it usually stays in python. The project mentioned above was written entirely in numpy &amp; pandas via Jupyter. Visuals done via plotly.

Within the context of what Im trying to solve, am I on the right track? Is this or something similar common for people to usually do?


TL;DR: What is your pre-modeling data work like? How do you usually prepare your data? How repetitive and replicable do you try to make it?

Next they asked me how I would approach this in continuous time, and that sort of stumped me. I have usually seen such cases dealt with in only discrete time, and my best guess is that we also include ""time since point X"" as another feature in our dataset, and train our model on this data-set.

Hi All



Bit of background of my current situation. Currently pursuing a postgrad degree in data science with an undergrad in electrical engineering.


I landed a part time role as a system support analyst at a bank where I offer support on their multiple data systems for projects as well as maintain existing VBA and SQL code to support existing systems. I aim to stay here while I complete my postgrad studies.



The things Im doing right now are:

-Adding extra features to the existing systems Excel VBA front end.

-Remediating and maintaining existing SQL code (Microsoft SQL Server).

-Handling support tickets



The good thing about this role is Im exposed to data every day and I get to see how data is captured and utilised in a production environment. Since this is a career switch for me (previously worked as an electrical engineer) this role I believe will be a good stepping stone.



My question is how can I really get the most out of this role with my career goal to be a data scientist? 



What skills/areas should I expose myself too?



I feel quite lucky to find a part time position like this and will like to make the most of it.



Would anyone have any suggestions?

Thank you in advance.

As the title suggests I'm looking for some advice concerning two options for grad school I'm currently facing:  1) Get a Master's in Quantitative Methods or 2) Get a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience.

To give a little background, I know I don't want to go into academia (i.e. be a college professor) but I do have a passion for the cognitive research I'm involved in as well as statistics/analytics. The PhD program I've been accepted to focuses heavily on methods and statistics, and will afford me the opportunity to further my programming skills (R, Python, linux/unix), statistical knowledge, analytic skills, theoretical knowledge of computational modelling, and apply these skills to many different areas (medical, nutrition, human intelligence, and decision making).  On the other hand the Quantitative Methods program I've been accepted to is one of the top programs in the country and has a 98% hire rate for their graduates for the past 5 years combined.

I've considered this decision from many different angles and I very much want to pursue the PhD, BUT I'm stuck on one point.  When I graduate I'll be around 34/35 years of age and I'm worried I'll have trouble finding a job in analytics with a PhD at that age.  On the other hand I believe the training I get will be far superior to the Quantitative Methods program, I will be afforded the opportunity to work with some some huge behavioral, neuroimaging, and physiological datasets, and I'll be contributing to meaningful research that can make a real impact on people's lives.

So I guess my question is, how difficult do you think it is for a 34/35 year old with a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, experience in medical, human intelligence, decision making, and nutritional research, and experience in analyzing data of this nature?",15,6,False,self,,,,,

Say I'm predicting a binary variable Y from binary variables A, B, C

It seems that I would choose the first node based on the the variable which
resulted in the greatest reduction in entropy.

To compute this I would first find the proportion of success for each of A,B,C

* A = 0.12
* B = 0.04
* C = 0.78

From here [the
entropy](https://computersciencesource.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/entropycalc1.png)
can be computed as 

    -1 * (
        (0.12) * log2(0.12) + 
        (0.04) * log2(0.04) + 
        (0.78) * log2(0.78) + 
    )
    
     = 0.37 + 0.19 + 0.28 
    

Clearly A provides the greatest reduction in entropy, at 0.37.

So I would start the tree with the root node A.

My data is now split into two, `data-not-A` and `data-A`.

For variables `B,C` I would again find the proportions for each of the split datas.

* proportion of B successes in `data-not-A`
* proportion of C successes in `data-not-A`
* proportion of B successes in `data-A`
* proportion of C successes in `data-A`


And I would 

* compute the entropy for variables on branch `data-not-A`
* compute the entropy for variables on branch `data-A`

I've been attending data science meetups regularly since I started my job in August. The host for this meetup is moving to Canada and someone else is taking over his position. I was talking with this guy about how I wanted to give a talk but I don't really have anything of note to present yet. He gave me the opportunity to give a talk towards the end of May, and I don't want to back down.

Recently I've been fascinated with linear optimisation/programming. It came up briefly at work and one of my colleagues brought up a set of lecture notes for an implementation of a [toy problem in Excel.](http://web.mit.edu/15.053/www/Excel_Solver.pdf) Obviously, because Excel sucks I found a way to implement the same problem in Python.

Now, I'm not a huge mathematician but I do know multi-variable calculus and I'm pretty comfortable with Linear Algebra, so I figure that I might be able to dig a little bit into the background as well. I found a lot of interesting sources from MIT OCW.

(I bought ""An Illustrated Guide to Linear Programming"" because it's short and high level and "" Understanding and Using Linear Programming"" as a reference.)

I'm thinking of maybe optimizing a diet on calories and micro/macro nutrients since I'm doing some body building at the moment so this would be a fun application/experiment.

Id like to know what this community thinks of it as a language, seeing as how it was made for DS essentially, compared to the other more popular languages used currently. 

Will it end up supplanting Python/R?
Does it have any obvious advantage over the other languages other than speed? 
Is it useful/worth it to know?
Anyone here use it regularly?

I'm using Random Forrest to predict the movement of a football player on a pitch. Clearly, future position on the pitch is related to the last position.

Now I need to predict a sequence of (x,y) coordinates for a player and we are given the first 10 (x,y) coordinates of the player and we must predict the rest.

I can predict the players next position with very high accuracy if I have the last so I want to use past data to predict future using my own predictions as new x,y variables to feed into the model, how can I do this?

Article's TL;DR:

1. data analyst is more manual job, you work with business, produce reports, presentation not software;
2. you will not gain right coding practices and you will not be learning about modern machine learning/statistical techniques. Also the code you may produce most of the time will be one-off, throwaway scripts, code that only you will ever see, manually operated sequence of scripts, clicking through GUIs etc.

So overall I understand the main idea of this article and it does make sense, is it really true? Is the code data analyst writes ""one-off, throwaway scripts""?

Also if I am coming from software engineer and I do have decent programming background, I am already familiar with coding best practices, wouldn't the skills I would improve in data analysis role be more valuable in becoming data scientist than staying in software engineering?",57,26,False,self,,,,,
