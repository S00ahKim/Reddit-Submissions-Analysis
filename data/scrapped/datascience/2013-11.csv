Basically I envision storing the data I get from multiple cfd runs and multiple experiments and some automatic means of comparison between the two(this last is a bonus, a good way of storage would suffice). 

Right now I have been storing my results file with all their details in the file name like v=1h=1t=2 and so on, it is very cumbersome and I thougth there must be a better way of doing this. 

So I am looking at some sort of a ""DataFrame"" where I have some columns as length of tube, width of tube and so on and somehow relate that to set of files that would be output by a software called OpenFoam. Then compare the results I get from this with what I get from experiments. 

I am fairly good at programming in Python but not so good at other languages. I am willing to learn new tools. I would prefer highly if the recommendation involves opensource software. ",5,3,False,self,,,,,

Thanks to technology many of us now have the means to easily track our everyday actions through data. Through cell phones, Mint.com and FitBit, I have (as can you) gained access and insight into my daily life.
  
First, cell phones track where we are and when constantly. Second, if you use Mint.com, your financial data is available for you to download via .csv at the end of each month. Finally, I recently got a FitBit Flex and thus have been monitoring how much daily physical activity I get.
If this data is collected over a long period of time, perhaps it can be organized into one data set (or a program which combines the various data files) in order to numerically show behavior.
  
Personally, I'd love to know how my spending habits correlate to the rest of my life. Am I buying more things following days that I don't exercise? How much of my year (or life) have I spent at a gas station or drinking beer at the local pub? Who knows what connections could be mined from these datasets.
  
Anyway, thanks for reading*",2,3,False,self,,,,,
