I often know what statistical technique is most appropriate for a given problem but I don't know why.

Could you suggest any good free online classes that would get me up to speed in math, so that I can take advanced stats and probability classes later on?

My understanding is that I should take calculus 1-3 (there is a fun class on Coursera), linear algebra and differential equations. Is that correct?

I have **the chance to be paired up with a corporate mentor at the director/VP level** through a group I connected with. I've done some data work, running statistical tests in excel, creating some simple things in R, making a few heat maps... nothing that heavy.

I'm graduating at the end of the year with a BA in economics, and **I honestly don't feel like I'm nearly skilled enough yet to do much data work on my own**. I had a HUGELY disruptive personal issue come up that killed my time for about the last year, grades suffered, left a comp sci/stats research project, stopped all the coursers stuff i was doing, stopped learning python, walked away from a text semantics job opportunity (employer was a friend of a friend, and really loved my way of thinking and writing, and was willing to help teach me or wait for me to catch up on the learning curve of the software).

Im lucky that the albatross around my neck is finally gone, but a lot of damage was done, and now Ive got to rethink my plan. 

But back to the point, I need to give a description of what types of career and industry i want to work in, and what specific goals i want to achieve. Im not sure how novice, but super curious/industrious/focused, i can be to find a place in a data science related job, or if my best bet is to find my way into a firm that will let me work adjacent and then I can get back into the coursers game, maybe attend classes at a place like General Assembly, and then see if i can develop the skills to move into a role that looks like data science, or build up a resume to apply for a MS in an analytics/predictive/etc program and come out pushing harder into the field.

**Im wondering if you folks can help me think of some wording to use**, or some job titles to mention so i can help this organization find a mentor that can be of use to me, and so the mentor can be fitted to me. 

**I honestly am just in love with the idea of solving problems with data or looking for answers to questions with data.** The way its used in politics and governance is amazing (I love the open data efforts). Id love to be part of a group using data to help incubate small business, or revitalize areas of a city/state/country. Heck Id be glad to be a part of any group that could stand up and say were making better decisions/suggestions/products. based on our understanding of data whether that be strategy consulting or social media marketing/management. 

TL;DR: My concern is that **I dont think Im going to be qualified enough for the kind of job I want the day I graduate, but have this AMAZING opportunity to get setup with a high level mentor in pretty much any industry/career I want, whats a good starting point for me that could get me exposure to this stuff without being in over my head?**

PS: Because of my prior work experience (military) before coming back to college for my undergrad, I have a lot of experience writing and talking in front of people. I get a lot of compliments, and have had some success in life because of both. Im hoping I can find a meeting of those skills with what I DESPERATELY want to learn in about data analysis, maybe even using my those skills to help land me a spot so i can get exposed to some of the work and soak it up. One idea I had was landing a spot in a small economic or management consulting firm that was big on business analytics. There my communication skills could be an asset to them, while I could get to do more and more with the data analysis as I became more skilled. Or maybe something like Data-Journalism, where I could rely on one skill (writing) as I developed the other, but I imagine places like 538 are tough as nails to get into, and from what i see of my friends in journalism... that's not how you afford a middle class life.

I'd be glad to share a few job postings that got me excited (but might be over my head), if that'd be useful. I'm planning on having that in hand for my mentor once we're connected.

TL;DR

- Previous experience in IT, programming, data analysis
- Current MS CS student looking to get into data science or machine learning research
- Grad certificate in data mining
- Some research in ML on the way, looking to leverage this
- What other experiences/credentials/etc. would offer a good ROI trying to break into data science or ML research?


So first a little background:

- CS undergrad degree (BS), graduated in '07 from Canadian university - program provided solid programming, theory, math foundation, etc., all of the ""regular"" CS undergrad stuff
- Pre-BS work experience in IT (system admin, DB admin)
- Post-BS work experience in IT (system admin, programming) and as a data analyst at a governmental health oversight agency (""big data"")

I am a current CS master's student at a US state institution, anticipating a spring 2015 finish. I am completing all of my studies at a distance (online), but have made a few visits to the institution and will eventually make a few more. There are numerous reasons I pursued this route which made sense for me at the time, and which are irrelevant to this discussion. Ideally I would have relocated to matriculate at a top institution in person but, alas, that was not in the cards. 

All aspects of the program thus far have uniformly exceeded my expectations. Besides theoretical and practical gains all-around, some points of note:

- Programming abilities &amp; confidence are now next level, with some additional programming and algorithm courses still to come
- Numerous additional languages added to my skill set
- Of (unfortunate) note, my institution does not offer (pure) machine learning classes as opposed to what is covered in data mining course
- I specifically tailored a very technical and rigorous program and passed over what I would categorize as ""fluffier"" courses (no ""management"" courses) which I believe has paid off
- Upcoming thesis on ML or DM (will nail down specifics with advisor [AI professor] next week)
- Upcoming independent research course project in programming languages realm - looking to combine parallel, cloud, parsing with DB design and come up with a usable piece of software; admittedly nothing too groundbreaking, but hopefully a comprehensive look what I can do
- I have a few papers on arXiv and have been asked to submit some things for publication (no guarantees, obviously), and hold out hope a thesis produces something publishable
- FWIW I'm a straight A student, in undergrad, grad and certificate program

I am also finishing up the UCSD data mining certificate, completing my final course next month. I started it nearly 2 years ago and have intentionally spread it out over the course of my grad degree.  The program has covered machine learning algorithms, data mining technologies, and provided a solid theoretical &amp; practical foundation.

Additionally, I have also taken a bunch of Coursera courses, generally the ones you would expect me to list at this point (ML, Johns Hopkins DS courses, UW data science, programming languages, compilers, etc.). I have also undertaken some self projects, with some others lined up, and am looking to put together a solid portfolio of my work over the next semester (data science-style projects), and have some of my better lower &amp; higher level programming projects (less DS-related) on github.

My question, then, is this: What additional credential/project/experience/etc. would best help break into the worlds of ML research or data science? I'm sure a home run of a thesis wouldn't hurt, nor would a favorable outcome with my research project artefact, a few independent projects that gain some social media media traction or a couple of published papers. Pursuing a PhD in ML would be my top choice, but that isn't going to happen at this point either, realistically, and so I consider some of these other options:

- Machine Learning Summer School 2015 (somewhere) - contacts, good speakers, others sharing interest, cheap and quick
- Zipfian Academy or similar boot camp - generally good outcomes, but I'm Canadian and can't participate in hiring day (although as a Canadian getting US work permission is easier than other foreign nationals [no guarantees]); more expensive, but again, likely good outcome
- Pursue a kick-ass internship - could lead to a job, who knows, more uncertainty than boot camp (though cheaper)
- Something else???

- Canadian, looking to work (and live) in Canada, US or Europe (EU passport [likely] on the way, and I passably speak a couple of EU languages)
- Non-traditional student (mid-30s), family, kids, looking to start as high up on the food chain as possible &amp; prove self afterward
- Cliche, but very passionate about data, and even getting to understand machine learning I am still fascinated by it and view it as wizardry

I know I'm not going to compete on paper with most PhDs, but if I can do something more to stand out among other non-PhDs and genuinely improve my knowledge base I would certainly consider it. If you feel that I am kidding myself here with my goals based on my situation, please feel free to express that opinion as well. 

I also know there is no replacement for on the job skills and learning, but as a bit of an intellectual I don't mind extending ""schooling"" a bit longer and coming up with the best positioning for myself when I hit the job market. My goal is not cushy mid-management somewhere; I genuinely want to innovate and ambitiously contribute to something bigger than myself.

If you have gotten to the end of this and have something to contribute, I would genuinely be very interested in reading it. Please forgive my verbosity.",3,3,False,self,,,,,

I tried asking this over on/r/cscareerquestions, but someone suggested I would have more luck here. 

I did a quick search and didn't find anything matching my question, so I'm hoping I'm not hitting you with some mundane thing you've been asked before (despite the fact that it's on the mundane topic of ""Which programming language do I learn??"").

A bit of background: I'm a Math Masters Student-turned-Data Scientist who'll be beginning a job at a tech company soon. My knowledge of programming mostly stems from ""Technical Computing,"" so I know R, MATLAB, and Python (Python wasn't part of my research -- it was self-taught to make me employable, but it's quickly become my go-to for everything). EDIT: I also know SQL. Similar to Python, it was a self-taught deal. Many moons ago I took a C++ course in undergrad as part of an ""Intro to CS"" sequence, but I can't remember anything about it.

The company I'm working didn't hire me to be a Software Engineer, of course, and I could probably get by and be valuable knowing what I know, but I want to be as valuable as possible. I also want to make the lives of the engineers I'm working with easier, not harder. For someone like myself who: (A) Has a healthy amount of theoretical knowledge (i.e., it probably wouldn't make sense to devote myself to studying any more Machine Learning), and (B) Is approaching programming from a Data Scientist bent, what should I learn next?

Is it enough to know that I can drop into Cython for critical applications, or should I just go all-out and re-learn C++? Julia seems intriguing, but I'd rather devote myself to something with more of an ecosystem, at least for this early part of my career. I'm also not sure that it's VERY different from what I've done, and in addition to expanding my horizons professionally, it's as important for me to expand my horizons intellectually. (Granted, learning C wouldn't turn me into a CS major, but I think it would force me to think about some things I haven't really had to). Some cursory research suggests that everything is done on the JVM anyway, so maybe Scala? (I learned Java in high school and never pure Java again -- Scala seems pretty powerful, though, and despite my Java hatred there's no disputing the strength of its ecosystem).

I know this is a bit of a vague question, but I guess it can be boiled down to: ""I only know high-level, dynamic programming languages, specifically in the context of data analysis. Does it make sense for me to drop down a level (C or C++), learn a new paradigm with some potentially decent employability (Scala), or just keep refining my knowledge of the tools I already know (mostly finding ways to speed up Python - Numba, Hadoop Streaming, etc.)?""

I would like a job that uses numerical analysis, stats, or image processing (since I really like linear algebra and vectors). From what I've gathered, data science sounds very intriguing

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation regarding what to do with my life. I was in a Physics PhD program and completed the first year, but I no longer want the phd, I just want the Masters. However, funding is not guaranteed and working on a thesis for 2 semesters is required, which I'm not looking forward to. My other options include transferring to another grad program where I could start this fall. The Math and Stats programs won't accept me until fall 2015. However, a couple of engineering programs could accept me, but they will only offer funding if I apply and am accepted into their PhD programs. Also, unlike the Physics program where I'm almost done with the coursework requirements, I may have to take a bunch more required engineering classes. If I should apply to transfer to engineering, should I just 'lie' and say I want to do the phd?

Another option I have is to accept an offer to spend 1.5 years studying for a Master's in Computational Science at a school in Germany.

I have applied to jobs just in case I receive a good offer, and have recently had a few interviews for image processing, software test engineer, and statistical analyst positions. Problem is, the upcoming semester at the original Physics program I was in starts soon and I need to make a decision soon, and if I get a job offer, it may be a little late

I got this sample dataset, http://pastebin.com/bgVjHjC9

where I need to predict the area column wrt to all others.
""MON"" is month ,""DOW"" is day of week ,""LAT"" is latitude ,""LONG"" is longitude are categorical variables.RHUMID is relative humidity between 0 and 100, while others are either self explanatory or I dont know what they mean :)

 I am having the weird experience that whatever I try the residuals are increasing with the predicter,  on the validation set I get more errors where the true area is higher.

I thought that after one hot encoding for th categorical variables the size of the features went up a lot (from 15 to 45 I think). So I tried PCA on this where I saw that the explained variance really tapers off after 5 components, I conservatively kept 10. This did not help.
I have tried different blackboxes, lasso,ridge, random forest regressors to no avail.
I am doing something basic wrong here, can you guys troubleshoot this with me, i.e. usual mistakes, or error diagnosis tips?

I was thinking something along the lines of viewing each post and scoring the post's ""influence"" based on the number of likes, comments and shares.

There are a bunch of clustering algorithms, and each one can get you rather different results.
