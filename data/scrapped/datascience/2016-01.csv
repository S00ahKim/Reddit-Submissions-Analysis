I am relatively naive to the field so I can't really speak to what I think it is which is why I am asking you guys.

Also, what would you say is the best way to get involved? Is there a book that you have read that helped you get started down the data path? I purchased a 10$ course on Udemy (A-Z Data Science by Kiril Eremenko) and it's been pretty cool to learn how to use Tableau but I am only 10% in on the course so it's just been tableau basics and such. I will keep going in it as it is interesting but I'm just looking for other things. I will also look into courses at my college to help me learn more.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Hello guys, I'm a 4th year pharmacy student at the University of New Mexico. I've always been interested in nutrition, diet and lifestyle. During my diabetes rotation we would frequently administer a health literacy screening tool to assess a patients ability to read, interpret and act on information from a food label. I was surprised by how many people struggled to understand a basic food label including  simple carb counting, recommended daily intake and allowance. This was particularly concerning because the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is one of the cornerstone non-therapeutic, lifestyle modifications recommended in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Knowing how many people struggle with carb counting I decided to try to create an [app](https://mlbernauer.shinyapps.io/meal-planner) that will design a meal plan that meets a persons individual dietary requirements. The idea is that a nutritionist/dietitian/physician will be able to use this tool to custom build a meal-plan that contains the required nutrients given a persons specific dietary needs (i.e. calorie restriction, potassium/salt restriction, sugar/carb restrcition, protein etc). As of now the app uses a database of 256 DASH compliant recipes from the Mayo Clinic. To use the app you first need to specify your dietary requirements in the 'Dietary restrictions' section (the default settings are from DASH guidelines). You then adjust nutritional weights in the 'Nutritional weights' section. Setting a nutrients weight to 0 will remove it from consideration when designing your meal plan (i.e. set protein to 0 if you do not care how much protein you will consume in a day), alternatively if you set the weight to 1, the algorithm will try really hard to satisfy that requirement. Finally, select which meal categories you would like to eat during a given day (salad, sandwich, main dish etc). Adjusting the 'Meal diversity' slider will vary the number of unique recipes in the final weekly meal-plan. This feature is useful to reduce the number of meals needed to be prepped for a given week. For example; setting meal diversity to 0 will generate redundant recipes in the weekly plan; this is useful as the redundant meals can be prepped in bulk on the same day and eaten throughout the week reducing the amount of time cooking. Once you have all the settings specified, hit 'Create plan!' to create your weekly meal plan. Links to recipes and schedule as well as the number of servings to consume will be listed below and can be downloaded as a CSV to use in Excel or other spreadsheet. Statistics such as average daily nutrients for the week as well as actual daily nutrients are also listed. These values should be relatively close to your specifications however due to the algorithm used the likely will not be exact. In any case, you can adjust nutrient weights and re-run the program to further tune your meal plan.
#### Future direction
In the future I would like to put more work into creating a grocery list from the recommended recipes as well as allow users to vote on recipes they liked to increase their chance of reappearing in future meal plans. Additionally, it would help if the app knew what groceries/ingredients you had on hand and would make recommendations based on these in order to reduce cost/trips to the grocery store.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

XDATA is developing a number of cutting edge software applications and components to address timely challenges in data science and intelligence analysis. DARPA has made these applications free and open to the public available as a downloadable [open catalog](http://opencatalog.darpa.mil/XDATA.html) of reconfigurable, open-source software components. XDATA is inviting analysts from the defense and intelligence communities, law enforcement, the private sector, and the public at large to download and use these open-source applications and underlying code. Building a community around the XDATA software catalog can help shape future versions of these applications through use and feedback. The applications developed by XDATA in 2015 address the following challenge problems:

1. Mapping, predicting, and characterizing population movements within and between cities and regions

2. Cross-dataset dealiasing to identify the same entities across different datasets

3. Financial event detection, such as identifying evidence of market manipulation 

**Operation XDATA: A Public Event**
Through this site you can also learn how to volunteer to participate in Operation XDATA, which is a large-scale research program managed by Draper. This research is designed to evaluate and improve XDATA applications. As part of this research you will be able to use XDATA application with large data sets to complete challenging tasks.

I am fortunate enough to have gained a quasi data science position with Child Protective Services. I refer to it as ""quasi"" because my position is pretty much whatever I'd like to make it. Obviously, there are some non-negotiable reports that I'm asked to create but outside of those weekly reports I have free time to muck around in all of the data available to me. So I like to think I'm pretty sharp with my statistics so I began introducing statistical analysis tools I learned in college to the data available to me at work. No other analyst with the agency had done this before so my boss was impressed. It was just a simple standard deviation of removals (removing an abused child from a home) per worker. My goal was to identify those who are removing significantly more children and determine the possibilities as to why that is occurring (eg. Poor decision making, bad zip code, etc.). 

Anyways, the point I am trying to make was that I was trying to introduce stats to child welfare data and I thought that was data science. Then I find some resources on here which are suggesting machine learning as an important aspect to a data scientist. So I enrolled in a coursera course on machine learning. My concern is that I don't know if I'm headed in the right direction because the data I deal with isn't about property, money, medical measurements, etc. My data is on children and how long they have been in care, open investigations vs. closed, legal status, type of abuse, etc. I just don't want to spend a ton of time learning the wrong thing. So far I am keeping up with the machine learning course but it isn't easy. I'm also trying to learn R but so far the majority of my ""analysis"" is done in excel. 

Thanks for any insight or input you can provide. I'd just like to add that I'm very passionate about this because I feel that I may be able to make a significant impact on the work done in my agency if I had the right knowledge. There are patterns everywhere in Child Welfare so I imagine there is something better I can do with the data instead of just reporting what happened in the past.",17,19,False,self,,,,,

Hey everyone! So excited to kick off this AMA with all of you - thanks for all the AMAzing questions!!

Im posting some initial responses now and then we'll all be around for a LIVE discussion 2pm-5pm ET today so be sure to hop back on the thread if you want to chat more.

To kick us off, a response to the question du jour: how do I get started in a career in data science? This seemed to be a pretty big topic so thought Id write to everyone at once. I've added a comment below but chime in with comments if you have advice and thoughts too! 

Talk soon!

Hello! I'm Jake Porway and Im a machine learning and technology enthusiast who loves nothing more than seeing good values in data. I founded a nonprofit called DataKind in the hopes of creating a world in which the power of data science is harnessed in the service of humanity.

In our 4 years here, DataKind has brought together volunteer data scientists to build predictive models to help Amnesty International prevent human rights violations, scraped websites to help the World Bank measure inflation and used satellite imagery to help GiveDirectly address poverty. Were headquartered in New York City and we have Chapters in Bangalore, Dublin, San Francisco, Singapore, the UK and Washington DC. You can find more about our projects through the case studies we've written up here -&gt; http://www.datakind.org/projects

In terms of my background, I studied machine learning and AI as an undergrad in computer science at Columbia University and then later as a Ph.D. in Statistics at UCLA. Ive always been fascinated by the ways intelligent machines can be used to improve the world and took that interest into my work in computer vision in grad school and later to The New York Times R&amp;D Lab, where I built prototypes for the future of media. I think we live in one of the most exciting times in human history, in which we are just now realizing the power of a fully digitized world and the way that humans and machines can work together to actualize our visions for humanity.

To get things rolling, allow me to intro some of my colleagues at DataKind who'll be joining me in answering questions (drumroll): 

* Pete Darche, our Data Engineer and one of DataKinds first staff members
* Nick Eng, our Data Science Manager and alumni of the UChicago Data Science for Social Good program
* Miriam Young, our Communications Specialist and super fan of all things pro bono

Well be online Wednesday January 13th 2-5pm ET to answer your questions live, but feel free to start posting questions and upvoting now so we can get the conversation going. Talk soon!",118,67,False,self,,,,,

I am on my way to finishing a Math PhD and am thinking of a career in data science. I have a very strong math background and solid stats/probability background - took two stats and a machine learning class in addition to most pure math classes out there.

That being said - **there is nothing on my CV that showcases my coding/CS knowledge** (except for a theory of computation class I took way back). I would say I am intermediate at python (used it for some math stuff - I do discrete math/graph theory) and getting above average at R (used it in the machine learning/stats classes to implement stuff like adaboost or random forests, been playing around with Kaggle datasets for like 6 months now). 

My main questions is: **given my credentials, what is the best way to show to a prospective employer that I can code?** github? blogs? And perhaps more subtly: **how can I asses my own level of coding skill?** It could be that I am fooling myself into thinking I know my stuff just to be completely overwhelmed in a real world situation.",15,11,False,self,,,,,

I'm completely new to this, so please tell me if something's wrong with that I'm saying.

Right now, I'm in the midst of a bioinformatics internship that works with single-celled RNA sequencing data analysis. However, I've encountered an interesting package called (Monocle)[https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/vignettes/monocle/inst/doc/monocle-vignette.pdf] that relies on this interesting concept of pseudotime and applies graph theory to try and find differentially expressed features from grouped samples.

From what I understand, the analysis consists of four parts. It first represents each sample with a dimension per feature. It then reduces the number of components by trying to find the independent ones. A minimum spanning tree is constructed on the samples, and then tries to find the longest path through the tree. It then finds alternate paths.

These paths represent gradual evolutions of samples where, I think, given the context of cell analysis, we are also looking for a spectrum of differences between cells but also want to find the progression from one state to another--for example, from healthy to cancerous cells.

I just thought I'd post it here and share. What do you guys think about this analysis method? Do you know of similar ones? What do you think this is best suited for?

I've read up on many websites and watched several videos on the subject, but I'm not too sure about whether this is the right choice.

First of all, is it useful to obtain a degree in data science or is it seen as a waste and money-grabbing for universities. As it will be costly to get this degree, I don't want to waste my time and money into this, if other degrees are more worthwhile.

I'm using a throwaway to ask this question, coz my present employers are here on Reddit. So, I know a bit of data science, I have participated in a few Kaggle competitions, at times got in top 10 ranks in some small competitions (700 participants). But I think I don't have the key element it takes to become a data scientist i.e. Mathematics. I know stats well, but I am not good at this stuff I see on internet, like this completely went over my head http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/05/scaling-convnets/. 
How do I become like them? I know Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, etc and can implement them to get some results, but I feel like shooting in the dark. 

I need a mathematics reference to learn step by step:
1. Probability
2. Algorithmic mathematics that goes behind these algorithms.

What would you guys recommend? I don't live in a rich country, so my options are limited to online videos and books. 

Your help will be much appreciated. :)

I've been into data science/analytics since my 2nd year of undergrad when I first learned about it. To prepare myself, I ended up double majoring in Computer Science and Economics from a top Canadian university. I am currently doing a masters in data science degree from a US top 30 school. 

I did two summer internships during undergrad, one with a big US bank and the other with a insurance company. Both of them using SAS and SQL. I also have a lot of experience with python and R from my undergrad/graduate course works and research. 

However, as I start to look for jobs, I've realized that Data Scientist jobs are mostly senior level and requires 5+ years of experience, while entry level data jobs are mostly business analyst doing SQL. The few junior data scientist positions I've applied to all had tons of applicants, and I don't hear back from many.

I am really confused. I thought I prepared myself well to enter this field but the reality is much different than I imagined, and it's been really discouraging. Does anyone have any advice on how I should proceed with my job search? Should I just start off with a business analyst job even though my whole master's degree was about R/Python/ML? 

edit: Wow, thank you all for your helpful comments and insights! If I can't find anything soon I guess I'll just have to start looking for analyst/BI until I gain more experience. It's just been disappointing since I did have jobs(not DS) lined up after my undergrad but I really wanted to do data science so I pursued a master's for it instead of working..",52,18,False,self,,,,,

A little background...

Input: Observational data taken on 7 animals and their partner states. The data was taken in 10 second intervals, divided into sections of the enclosure, and coded by a letter. For example, if X and Y were in a tight group, they would be coded in ""Main"" as XY (or YX) for however long their partnership occurred. 

Desired Output: I need gross tallies. I do not need to account for every single possible pairing as I am looking for specific trends and their frequencies. For example, X and R belong to different groups and I do not need to find their tally but X and Y are a common pair. 

Issues: 
- Usually I would use MATLAB for data analysis but as MATLAB cannot take letters, I would need to turn all of this into a numeric matrix. The problem with that is, not only are animals paired like this (XY) but they are also paired at each other (X&gt;Y) for aggressive interactions and in numeric form, MATLAB would treat that as an equality statement (or correct me if I am wrong). In addition, it would take a lot of fucking time to convert this data into MATLAB readable data. 
-I do not know Python and do not have time to pick it up at this time. 

Question: Can I use JAVA? I know JAVA and I feel like the code to find it would be relatively straightforward. (if(XY || YX) count)...etc. I understand that you can create and read Excel files in JAVA but either I did not understand or did not see how one can read a pre-existing file and analyze it through JAVA.

Furthermore, where does the data science career path lead in tech jobs (i.e. Oracle, TeraData, Amazon, etc.)? Do people usually top out at 'Lead Data Scientist' or is there a pretty smooth transition into management at some point? Is an MBA a prerequisite for management positions or is it just a function of exceptional work?

Did you feel like it was easy to make consistent progress in your role or did you feel like you were struggling to assert your usefulness?

Just want some advice, I am trying to design a pipeline for a prediction model for Customer Churn.

What I aim to do is, come up with a list of customers ranked by their likelihood to churn. The problem I have is how to design this so It can be run every month.

I want to avoid using the same data I have to build the model to also use in a testing set which is a big no no.

Here are my ideas but i am having trouble articulating the pipeline:

Start of next month: Extract a Dataset of current customers.
End of next month: Flag the customers from the above set who churned. 

Now I want to use that set as a train set, but obliviously I can't use the whole set to build the model, and I need a validation to internally validate the model.

I thought I could sample that set, use the sample to train a model, then predict on the remainder.

I then extract another list of customers at the start of the following month and repeat the process.   


Is it silly to constantly train a new model? I want to have it dynamically change to include any time varying variables and thought it would be easier to do monthly evaluations on high important variables etc.

Should I do some MOOCs/nanodegrees online and then apply or retake the prereqs and then look further.. are there any programs that can encompass all the prereqs and get me geared for a MS and a job in data analysis and furthermore in Data science in Healthcare??

I think this is a question that pertains to many current students (at any level, Bachelors, Masters, or PhD). I am currently a Master's student in Statistics, and am interesting in and trying to get into the Data Science job market. I studied Statistics during my undergraduate years also, and have a couple of years of experience in research with applied statistics using R. I have recently taken great interest in machine learning methods and in addition to having taken a course on Big Data using Hadoop, I have been studying various machine learning methods with R on my own.

I heard that having a portfolio of some sort of past or current projects related to statistics/data science is a great way to appeal to employers, and I am looking to create one for myself. I am wondering what would be the best means of showcasing my skills.

One could be participating in Kaggle competitions and creating a reputation for myself by building a profile with my competition performances. Another could be contributing codes and programs from my past school projects or job experiences on Github. 

Do these seem like reasonable ways for me to create some sort of portfolio for myself to show to employers to get a job/internship in Data Science roles? And if there are other or better ways to showcase my skills, how could I do that?

| Var1 | Var2 | Var3 | Out |
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| | | | |

Where vars 1-3 are the variables which affect the outcome (out), and each row is a new example. 

So let's say our table refers to chances of being asked out on Tinder, and our variables are ""Good Looking?"", ""In Shape?"", ""Works in Data Science?"" and are all Y/N variables, and the outcome is Y/N whether they got asked out. Each row then refers to a particular example, so guy 1 who was good looking and in shape but didn't work in data science obviously didn't get asked out, while guy 2 wasn't good looking or in shape but compensated by working in data science and so got asked out, etc. So far so good, and we can use a random forest with the tree package or whatever on this table.

But what about when each example has a different number of variables? Let's say we're doing image classification, and want to know whether the image is happy or sad, and as model inputs, we use each pixel in the image as a variable. Now, each example has a different number of variables, because each image likely has a different number of pixels. We can't then make a table of standard input variables out of it, and so can't run a normal model package on it (which normally want to know the columns to use as inputs and those for outputs, consistent across the table).

I have no idea how this works in practice and am keen to find out. I would guess you either process the image into some standard set of variables (e.g. top-left average colour, top-right average colour, bottom-left... etc) but maybe there's more to it?",2,3,False,self,,,,,

The biggest issue I imagine is the lack of packages/libraries/modules, effectively meaning that you may end up having to code your PCA from scratch. But there might be other issues I'm not appreciating. I've been thinking about picking up a new language (mostly just because), and if functional languages have utility in DS then I might be fairly inclined to do so.

The project requires about 100 fields of data from a paper survey (can only be print, survey subjects are not able to get to phones or computers) from about 200 survey subjects to be input and then manipulated. 

I had arrived at Kobo Toolbox as a good tool and was almost getting it installed on the organisation server before a pretty outrageous quote from an IT contractor put an end to that being done. We're a NFP so not easy to do things that cost much more than... nothing. 

Anyway - I now need to simply set up a system by which the survey data can be input in a safe and clean way. By that I mean a way that prevents error etc. 

It occurs to me that I could just have it input straight into Excel, or use an Excel data input form, but this is probably going to be an ongoing project so I really want to set up something great and workable and sustainable and easy. 

Other constraints:

- Not easy for things to be installed on servers due to IT ridiculousness;
- Windows computers used - thin clients on a network;
- Cannot use cloud based solutions as data is too sensitive and needs to be held securely. 

I don't know - this is starting to seem pretty silly. But maybe someone out there has a solution that my endless Googling hasn't uncovered.

I currently work as a Data Scientist at a Fortune 100 company in the Midwest.  For a variety of reasons, I am interested in switching to a new place of employment.

One of the main benefits of my current position is the fantastic Work/Life Balance.  I have a bunch of hobbies outside of work, so this is an important factor for me.  That said, there are a few companies I am interested in in the SF Bayarea, but they tend to have around ~300 employees.

I know it can vary significantly by company culture, but does anyone here have any experience working at a company around this size and is willing to share their experiences?

I'm a second year cs undergrad with dreams big enough to work with all the data we have :D. I am starting to look into all the requirements i would need to be successful in the field.
I've realized that a background in math is pretty mandatory. 

And heres my question. At my university, there is a math minor i could take which would make me take 4 statistics classes and 2 other math classes. The other option for me is a minor in computational data. This seems more relevant to data science as a whole, but here i'm only required to take 1 stats class. The other classes are in data visualization/ analytics and such.

I was hoping someone on reddit could point me in the right direction. I could specify classes i would be required to take if necessary. Thanks!",13,1,False,self,,,,,

I have very strong C++, python, and data analysis skills, but I've recently started to do some side projects (read: a blog to potentially help get a job after I graduate) that involve basic web scraping to get access to some data.

The extent of my ability is to do a lot of this type of thing:

    req = urllib2.Request(url_string)
    con = urllib2.urlopen( req )
    soup = BeautifulSoup( con )

and then parse through the soup for the things I'm interested. Often I'm looping over tons of urls and looking for one very specific string inside of an enormous soup... which is all very slow. 

Does anyone have advice for how to do this faster/more efficiently? Or perhaps some resource (MOOC maybe?) that might show me better guidelines to handle these types of tasks?
