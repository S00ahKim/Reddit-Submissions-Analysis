I am in the final year of my PhD in cognitive neuroscience (US), and am interested in turning my career sights to fields such as data science (rather than academia). This motivation has grown since learning that I will be relocating to a major city in the Pacific Northwest that has many opportunities for careers in data science. 

I have skills in research methods, statistics, data analysis/visualization, working with EEG and eye tracking, programming (SPSS, Matlab, R, Python; however, I'm not the best programmer), and some machine learning. Based on what I've seen in recent data science postings in my future city of residence, it looks like there's a fair bit of overlap between my current skills and what they're looking for. Some positions additionally look for things like experience with SQL/databases, C++, more rigorous machine learning experience, etc.

Has anyone here successfully transitioned from neuroscience/cognitive neuroscience to data science? If so, how much ""catching up"" did you need to do, skill-wise? Do you have any suggestions regarding resources to accomplish thus supplemental learning?

Does anyone else have any general tips on what I should be focusing on in order to be competitive in data science? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",0,0,False,self,,,,,

R: My STAT classes usually require us to use R. I personally love R, as it's my tool of choice early in my undergrad career.

Python: So I've heard that Python is on the up and up for Data Science, and may soon overtake R. Do you guys think this is true, and what are your thoughts on Python vs R?

SQL: So I've kind of had some exposure to MySQL, and created some basic tables and queries. But may I ask, what's the difference between Excel and MySQL exactly? I feel as if Excel does more, so if that's the case, why is SQL such a big deal in data science?

I think I'm a pretty smart, discerning person, but the things I've read and heard about this career are, as a whole, so confusing and so contradictory it's hard to know what to think.

Several months ago, after doing some research, I thought this was a viable path for me and that I had a plan to get into the field. Today, I don't know whether any of the things I believed about this career months ago are true, whether it's realistic for me to get a data science position in the near future, or whether this is a career I would even want.

I thought I'd list paraphrased version of some of the confusing and often contradictory things I've read and heard about this career for your amusement. If anyone has thoughts, by all means please comment, although at this point I don't think I'll believe anything anyone says about this stuff without experiencing it firsthand.

* Data science is a viable career path for people without a strong technical background who are willing to take a couple online courses.

* It's very straightforward to get a data scientist position if you have an advanced degree in any quantitative field, especially if you can code.

* It's almost impossible to get a data scientist position right out of (grad) school. No matter what field your degree was in, you probably need to spend a couple years working as a data analyst or BI person to get some domain expertise.

* Data science is a field with a serious talent shortage; companies are desperate for anyone who's at all qualified.

* The data science job market is flooded with applicants; any open job is going to get dozens if not hundreds of reasonably qualified applicants. It's really hard to get a job unless you seriously stand out. 

* The technical skills are the least important aspect. It's more important to work well with people and be a good communicator. You can easily learn the technical aspects on the job.

* A data scientist just needs to know more statistics than a programmer and more coding than a statistician.

* A data scientist needs to know all about optimization, numerical analysis, algorithms and data structures, and lots of advanced machine learning and statistics.

* The only things you really have to know are the fundamentals: be able to write some code in Python and R and know about confidence intervals and linear regression.

* In order to appeal to employers, it's crucial to have experience with the *exact technologies* the employer uses. If they use Hadoop, you must know Hadoop. Etc.

* There's no way to be a data scientist without knowing some pretty advanced math.

* Math isn't really relevant for data science in practice, and some of the most successful data scientists I know don't even know calculus.

* Data scientists spend their time working on intellectually challenging problems that are just as interesting as those in academia.

* Data scientists spend most of their time on boring data munging issues, usually with an ultimate goal of selling more shoes or some other horrible marketing thing.

* The data science field is really hot and will surely continue to grow for many years to come.

* Data science has hit its peak; it will continue to be useful in its areas of legitimate application, but companies are realizing it was oversold and they will be cutting back.

* There is an amazing amount of value to be had in data science.

* Most data scientists contribute nothing worthwhile to their employers.

* You must have a portfolio of projects to show employers.

* I don't know any data scientists with a portfolio of projects; my coworkers and I think that's a waste of time.

Here's another discouraging thing: looking at job ads for data scientist positions, there is such a crazy variety of skills and experience desired for each position. While I know that ""Required skills"" aren't always really required, it's pretty bewildering when:

* one position says you must have NLP experience;

* one says you must have cybersecurity experience;

* one says you must have Javascript and web programming experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience in the health care industry;

* one says you must have retail marketing experience;

* one says you must have bioinformatics experience;

* one says you must have experience in the intelligence community;

* one says you must have Django experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience with the Microsoft products SSMS, SSAS, and SSRS;

* one says you must know SAS;

* one says you must have experience in financial analysis.

In the above list, when I listed specific technologies, it was because they seem somewhat outside the standard data science toolkit, as far as I know. But even when they mention ""mainstream"" technologies, they vary so much between the different positions, and there is such a massive list. Different ones want AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, PostgreSQL, MySQL, D3, Tableau, MapReduce, Flink, Mahout, MongoDB, Cassandra, and many more.

Judging by the ads, there is probably hardly anyone in the world who is qualified for more than one of these positions... and yet they are all ""data scientist"" positions.

Actually, I think half these employers just copy &amp; pasted a bunch of buzzwords into their ads, but that's depressing for another reason.",88,131,False,self,,,,,

Right now my team is having trouble with our Linux boxes because our IT dept isn't used to supporting linux (our team switched last summer), and we're the oddballs in the company now. A handful of sys admins use linux, but they don't get ""support"" from tech, they are local admins for their machines (something our CTO doesn't want to do). 

In one conversation I had with the CTO he suggested it *might* make sense to switch us to OSX if we still wanted a Unix core, but that I'd have to work on the justification.

Could folks here help me work out the details about *why* we want a Unix box? 

The rough examples I have are things like:

*  easier to get Py packages to install\*, especially higher level scientific computing ones (Numpy, sklearn)

* command line tools make it easy to poke at big data sets

* our servers are linux so getting used to using command line stuff locally helps us push work to servers

* minor conveniences like having a terminal window that can resize and allow tabs (both things Windows 7 doesn't allow) make it a lot easier to move around files, or drop into R / Python and get back to what we're doing. 

Are there other arguments I should be making?

note on installing packages. Our sys team wasn't familiar with Anaconda and I think did a wonky install of it on a Windows machine. They installed it but it appeared I still needed some admin rights to use conda to create environments and then install packages into those environments. 

Further, the idea of installing and using a lot of Python modules seems like it's a much different way of doing things from our developers, so the idea of a package manager that makes that an easy process seems unusual to them. ",48,17,False,self,,,,,

I'm new to ""data science"" in general. To learn, I'm using a side project idea where I'm trying to digest daily chat conversations.

But to do so, I first need to create message thread (clustering?) out of chat message.

 &amp;nbsp;

this is the model of the `Message`:

    User=string
    timestamp=int (unix timestamp)
    text=string

I have 13,000 of these messages.

My initial idea is to cluster the messages based on timestamp since usual conversations happen in bursts (20-30 msgs over 3-5 minutes, then nothing for hours, etc).

I tried using DBSCAN (using `scikit-learn`) but it doesn't seem to work well for single dimension dataset.

I'm attempting to use WEKA to spot patterns in a dataset I'm analysing, composed of a binary win/loss and 12 numerical values. I've had some luck using WEKA to spot clusters in advertising data in the past, so I'm not totally new to it. 

However, this time, every single classifier I try to run as an initial step produces garbage - 99% error rates, etc. I've tried Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and a bunch of others. 

Any ideas on why that could be, what approach I should be using within WEKA or if there are any seriously noob mistakes I could have made? I'm not at all new to analysing data, but I'm new to using this type of automated data analysis technique - most of my data analysis has been done by the old-fashioned approach of staring at the numbers until they make sense :)

Background: I'm a recent geology grad with a BS and MS focused in petroleum geology. I currently work for a data analytics company that provides geologic and other petroleum industry related data to operators (Exxon, Chevron, etc.) and service companies (Haliburton, SLB, etc.). On a day-to-day basis I work with a massive amount of data that include anything from monthly production data for an entire country to reservoir properties for  oil/gas fields. I mainly work in Excel, ArcGIS, and other industry related geoscience/engineering software packages. 

As a former intern for the company I focused on creating workflows for other geologists to become more efficient when collecting, formatting, and analyzing the data we receive for entry into our database and analysis. I also analyzed production data from an emerging basin. Now I'm looking to find ways to integrate more advanced statistics, machine learning, and other methods. Before I proceed in doing so, I feel a more formal education process may be more useful in learning the tools that data scientists use.

I'm starting to look into two options. 1) an MS in Data Analytics, 2) a Certificate in Data Analytics. Does the certificate hold any value for data scientists or is a degree a must?

I posted this on the r/statistics forum and I had some great answers, but due to that forum being more statistician based I wanted to see some POV's from data scientists.

I'm currently a graduate student in a MS in Statistics program and I want to eventually work as a data scientist after I graduate (currently fluent in R, Python and SQL.) Looking at my college's course website, I wasn't sure which elective classes to take that would best supplement a data science career. I'm allowed to take 4 electives on top of 6 required courses. The electives are:

* Multivariate Methods
* Categorical Data Analysis
* Design of Experiments
* Operations Research
* Mathematical Modeling
* Statistics Quality Control
* Time Series and Forecasting
* Survival Data Analysis
* Clinical Trials
* Nonparametric Statistics
* Sampling Methods
* Stochastic Processes
* Bayesian Statistics
* Data Mining and Analytics

I'm strongly leaning towards Data Mining and Analytics as well as Bayesian Statistics because I hear that is a fundamental part of machine learning. Any other recommendations?

I have gotten a task where I have to identify users whose identity is sometimes hidden. I have two data sets: a fully labeled, and a partly labeled.

The labeled data set looks like the following: 

`date time ip email user-agent cookie`

The unlabeled data set looks like the following:

`date time ip ? user-agent ?`.

Based on the labeled dataset, I have to figure out the missing emails of the unlabeled data set.

My approach this far has been:

- Map every line to the format: `ip user-agent email`
- Look up `ip` and `user-agent` and find email.

This works for some of the unlabeled, however there are several which will have multiple hits; that is, one `ip,user-agent` key can have multiple emails associated with it.

Do you have any suggestions as to how I might identify a user further than just the `ip` and `user-agent`? Right now I'm only matching on the `user-agent` as a whole string.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

For the past year, I've been working with R  for doing most of my data science work (EDA, Modelling, ML, Visualization ) and I really like it.
But I feel that I also need to get comfortable with python data science ecosystem,(and I'm not new to python, It's just that I'm new to doing data science work in python).However, after dabbling with python libraries like pandas, numpy and all the other usual suspects,  I feel that R is so much better for a lot of statistics/ml related work, It's just that it makes so much more sense doing these work in R rather than python.

But I also like various (libraries which can do some serious ml stuff)ML libraries in the python ecosystem, which is more intuitive than their R counterparts.to be more specific, the whole deep learning stack.

Now that I've established the fact that I just don't like the way python approaches the statistics/visualisation work (I'm not saying it's bad, it's just that I prefer R over python) but like the Python ML ecosystem(mostly the deep learning stack) 
what should I do?

1. should I invest more time in learning python for data science work(specifically visualisation and statistics work)
2. or should I adopt a hybrid approach, I.e. I do most of the work in R, If I need some heavy ML work I do that with python.

(The Hadleyverse in R has spoilt me, and it(tidyverse) keeps getting better every day)

give me some suggestions/advice I'm really confused
and also 

If you think option 1 sounds good and I must invest more time in learning python(for data science) and If you think I should  ditch the hybrid approach  suggest me what else should I do

I've done a decent bit of computational physics research to the point where I've published work. In the process, I've discovered that I really enjoy the data analysis part of the work. Given that I have a relatively strong background in analytical work/mathematics/computation, I'm interested in getting started on the data science career path. 

From what I've learned, it seems that data scientists have a whole laundry list of skills/tools they are expected to know in order to be competitive in the job market. It seems that learning all of them would be impossible for all but the most dedicated autodidacts. In my mind, the best way to learn them would be to get exposed to them over time while working in the industry. 

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what would be the right path to take where the focus would be on future growth and development towards a career as a data scientist. Would it be best to try to get an entry level data analyst position? Or would something like a software engineering position be more applicable? Perhaps an internship that's more focused towards that kind of work? Would it be fruitful to instead go for a PhD in Physics before trying to get into the industry (something I've strongly considering in the past)? 

I worry that I could get stuck in a position where I'm just doing relatively straightforward plotting/analysis in Excel for a company that has no interest in more sophisticated techniques and it would be a dead end.

- Designed with immutability and concurrent programming in mind. You can call multiple databases and APIs with your multicore processors, do complex things with the data and not have to worry much about a locking model or inconsistent state.
- Designed to look better, be more readable and be more succinct than other Lisps (e.g. Common Lisp, Scheme).
- Its integration with the JVM allows access to huge libraries, and its dedication to the JVM means that it works well with other JVM-based languages and ports (e.g. Groovy).

It is more immutable than Scala, it is faster than R, it feels more natural than functional programming in Python. It has nice things like first-class ratios. Incanter is the ""data science library"" for Clojure; however, Clojure's data structures (lists, vectors, maps (etc), all of which can be nested), and the fact that it's functional, means you can do a lot of work just with the base of the language.

I really feel that it's a bit of a hidden gem and currently undervalued and underused in the data science world. If R gives you functional programming (if you want), and Python gives you speed and good production code, can Clojure do both of those things in a succinct, seamless way?

Hope you are all having a good day :) I'll try to keep this short:

I'm 25 years old, graduated with a BS degree in exercise science but realized my senior year I hated the idea of working in exercise, therapy, corporate wellness, etc. 

So I spent my last semester learning SQL in my free time, then I graduated, and then worked as a data analyst for two years at two different jobs and the last 6 months my team has started transitioning me to more data science tasks at my current place.

The issue is, I really do not like this career and don't think its right for me. But, I feel stuck because I don't know how to take my skill set and transfer it to a new career path. Absolutely everything on my resume is about reporting, SQL, R, databases, data visualization, dashboards, and so on.

The specific reason I don't like this field is actually that I realized I don't like to code. It's a total snoozefest for me. Whether it was writing some stored procedures or modeling some data. I'm sure its not just the languages that I dislike as I have some experience in c++, javascript, and java...equally boring.  Just the act of programming that is making me very, very, very, very, very, very, VERY depressed. So I figure its high time to get out of this field.

I really do enjoy some of the aspects of my job, such as getting to do math (my mentor at work is an ex-quant and has been guiding my learning in probability. It's a lot of fun!) or getting to investigate the deepest darkest corners of our database trying to hunt down some obscure table of data.

I wanted to hear from anyone who has transitioned or starting to transition out of data science and how that is going. Any advice from others on how to take our data science/analytics skill set and start a new career path? I almost considered just going back for a second bachelors in mathematics and restarting my career. Its been a shitshow trying to apply for masters programs because of my undergrad degree. But even then, I'm scared I'll end up back in some computation/programming role in my future.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Having been a loyal, albeit predominantly lurking, member of this sub for some time now. I often see the frustration (on both ends) from people looking to become employable as Data Scientists and those in the industry sick of answering the same questions.


#


Something I was really hoping to get into was a bit of branch from the commonality of these posts and more towards: I honestly feel like I am employable/can bring value to a company, however, I cant even get my resume through the door because I do not have a degree.


#


For context:  I have been a freelance python developer for going on a decade now, I have competed in many data science challenges (even won a few), participated and won more than a few hackathon/coding challenges, and have gone through just about every noteworthy MOOC I have found.  This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the things Ive compiled in my pursuit of employment  but I thought it was a good start.   That said, I have unfortunately never actually held a position which has labeled me as a developer or anything which would seem remotely applicable on a resume when applying to a data science firm or company looking to employ someone for ______ (insert something about data).  I also hold no higher education degree.
I have carefully read many posts here which say you need to be able to tell a story with your work, and demonstrate your thirst and ability to wrangle data.  I also have a pretty decent portfolio designed to hit many of the points this sub has deemed worth showing off.


The catalyst for my current frustration (and this post if Im being honest) came a few weeks ago when I was presenting my findings at the end of a local event and was approached by a lead data scientist, who was judging this particular competition, who went on to say something like:


You seem to have a better understanding of neural networks than most of my data scientists and the way you designed your process was pretty innovative.  Are you looking for a job, by chance?


Me: I would love to come down for an interview


Him: Great!  So, where did you get your degree from?

Me: Well, I dropped out of college my sophomore year but {heres some of things Ive done to demonstrate my passion and pursuit of this trade  see above}


Him: Oh, okwell, let me get your information and Ill get back to you


Me: Well let me get you my gitlab and I can send you some ideas and demonstrations I have as well  


Him: Yeah, Ill have someone from recruiting email you sometime in the future.


I would like to clarify that I *completely* understand that I could not possibly have the theoretical foundation that someone with a PhD in stats or mathematics could have, however, I honestly believe I continue to demonstrate that I have a real passion for this work  and a fairly respectable aptitude for it.  I am also in no way trying to say that I can do the same job as someone with a PhD, or take anything away from their value.


From my perspective, this field seems to have a mindset much like software development used to be notorious for: no degree  no job, even though it was fairly obvious that someone could learn to code to some functional level, completely on their own (again, I completely understand the hate for code bootcamp grads vs. college grads, etc). 
 

I have to wonder if those of us who have been participating in data science as a hobby via Kaggle, Numerai, DataDriven, local events, etc  have even the smallest shot of making enough noise to get an employers attention (outside flat-out crushing multiple kaggle comps and creating a startup).


I have to imagine that there is a role for someone like me, even if its just to work with the folks with the strong theoretical backgrounds to quickly develop prototypes then fine tune  or something to that effect.  I have submitted somewhere in the region of 200 resumes, and only ever sat two interviews (which I thought and was told went very well) only to be stiff-armed by their HR departments.


I was hoping I could get some input from this sub  as, even through the smattering of reposts, someone always seems to take the time to reiterate (nicely) or provide some valuable insight to OP.  I do apologize if this particular topic has either been covered or beaten to death, but my search results didnt bring up much.


I appreciate any thoughts or insight you guys have and look forward to hearing from you.

I am finishing a PhD in medical image analysis. I am considering different options and I am really tempted by a data science career specifically applied to biotechnology. R&amp;D positions in my field are attractive but there really isn't that much flexibility in terms of location. It appears to me at least that the progression of a data scientist in industry is more flexible regarding location. I do think I would be a good match for data science. In addition to any quantitative/programming skills I have, I think I'm a pretty good communicator, work well in a team and can perform well in tough deadlines.

In any case, the issue I am having is based on my machine learning knowledge. I come from a mechanical engineering background, which seldom touched on statistics or any of the core background needed for ML. Throughout my PhD, I have used many ML tools (supervised/unsupervised classification, dimensionality reduction, regression etc..) but it has never been the focus. 

However, in all data science job requirements I have seen that require a PhD, they seem to specify that you need to be an expert (or at least very knowledgeable) in many aspects of machine learning. I consequently feel quite unqualified for any of these positions or just not competitive at all.

I have recently been offered a 2-year post-doc in a very well respected machine-learning/image-analysis group within my university. Its a 2 year post-doc focused on deep-learning for radiotherapy. The position seems to tick a lot of boxes that are minimum requirements for me and I think would make me a more competitive applicant. 1/4 of it would be software development in Python/C++ and 3/4 would be deep-learning/image analysis R&amp;D. I would be a contributor to an open-source deep-learning project, contributor to another private project, would hopefully publish a few deep-learning articles and it is deeply collaborative with various centers. 

I told the potential PI that I am looking to go into industry and would be using this as a stepping-stone. In terms of my background, will a 2-year post-doc in deep-learning/machine-vision with significant software development hinder my chances at potential career in industry? Or should I see it as an investment into my future? Would it be more worthwhile for me to apply to positions and take the best one? I am considering [Insight Health Data Science](http://insighthealthdata.com/) but I am not sure flying to the US is the best option.

I am in my late 20s now, I don't have much industry experience although I have plenty of research experience. I am fearful that continuing research at a university will really put me in a difficult position in the future. 

Thanks for reading and any comments!

Other than that its pretty tough for me to distinguish between the two programms. However, the higher price at Edinburgh University (12.700) compared to Heriott Watt (5200) I am wondering if its worth the difference?


Also as a side note, I am a bit worried that my undestanding of maths might be supbar. (I have almost top score in math courses, but they were laughable easy). So I would welcome any recommendations on a good book for preparing for the mathematics I will need.

Recently I've started getting interested in the data science field again and although I remember how most of the machine learning algorithms work, I wanted to first understand what I think the first step is: treating/cleaning data. I want to get good at this.

Do you have any book worth reading about this topic ? Any recommendation would be nice :)

If you have a book related to machine learning in general that you can recommend even though it's not about cleaning data, I'd be thankful as well since I'll look for those after.

My team just received an excel file with data from glassdoor reviews for our company for the last 8 years. The data contains 

-Job title (quite a few blank fields)

-Review city and state names (quite a few blank fields)

-Current job (Y/N)

-Rating from 0 (if blank) to 5 (highest rating) for: Overall satisfaction, career opportunities, Comp and Benefits, senior leadership, work-life balance, culture and values

- Business outlook (getting worse, staying the same or getting better)

- Recommend to friend (Yes or No)

- CEO Approval (Approve, No opinion, no rating, or do not approve)

- Pros and cons as free text fields

I've been playing around with the data. I was wondering if any of you had suggestions on interesting ways to look at this data to get insights.

Thank you!

So I'm currently a senior chemical engineering major at a University of California having some trouble finding chem-e jobs (the market is pretty bad right now). Throughout my years here, my favorite part of my classes have always been the programming and data analysis. Although I learned MATLAB at university, I picked up Python on my own and learned how to use some important data libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to replace MATLAB. I also know some SQL, although it's mostly performing ad-hoc queries. I also have a pretty good grasp of math through my engineering classes. Because of my interest in data, I was possible considering grad school in Data Science (preferable in California) but the thing is I don't have any formal computer science training and never took a statistics class. I also did not consider grad school until very recently (a week ago) so I have not taken the GRE or have any letters of rec. I'm now looking for some advice and opinions. Should I even consider grad school in data science or should I continue looking for chem-e-jobs for the next two months or so? Should I try applying to data analysts roles too?

I am a senior graduating in May and I want to get into Data Science. For some background, I am a Neuroscience BA with a CS minor and I've taken a plethora of CS courses (Data Structures, Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Computational Tools of Data Science, etc.) As a non-quantitative BA, I think I have a competitive disadvantage to apply for Data Scientist positions because I am a) not a Masters or PhD student and b) not even a quantitative major. Ergo, I have decided to apply for Data Analyst positions, in hope that my experience there can bolster me to my goals.

However, even when applying to Data Analyst jobs I have found myself either getting rejections or no emails at all. My GPA is not the best (2.96) but my GPA for all my CS courses is much higher.

I do plan to go to grad school in the next two years, but I wanted to get some work experience before I do so. Does anyone have any tips about how they would act if they were in my shoes? Thanks!

Hi, I got selected as a fellow in the Data Incubator, and am in a dilemma to join it or not. 
Background: I am in my final leg of a PhD in Geoscience, and have been preparing for Data science jobs for the past one year or so. I started actively applying for jobs in January, and till now I have had interview calls only from Geospatial datascience companies. I am still interviewing, and have few interviews lined up. However, I have not had much call backs from tech companies (who desire CS grads I presume). 

Presently, I have accepted a Datascience internship offer with a large Insurance company in their analytics team, with a very good chance of converting to full time (I won one of their recruitment competitions). However, I am not particularly excited about the insurance industry in general. 

Given this, does it make sense for me to give up the datascience internship opportunity and join the Data Incubator? Recent posts about Data Incubator seem to indicate their placement record is not quite what they claim to be. Also, I am an international grad student, hence most smaller companies and start-ups won't hire me for visa sponsorship reasons. Do big companies hire from TDI? Or is it mostly smaller companies?

I'm an arts grad who has fallen into the world of data and I'd really appreciate any advice on whether formal education might be the right next move for me.

I'm 3 years into my career at a massive tech consulting firm and I've ended up with pretty strong Tableau and data viz skills, with a decent amount of SQL and data modelling through the projects I've worked on. I'm now working with Hadoop (Hive &amp; Impala) and have started learning R.
Supposing that I could even get accepted onto a decent course, a masters in the EU looks to be around 12,000, and it's highly likely that I could come back to my current job after the graduating - so not a huge amount of risk in taking one. Would it be worth doing?

My main reasons for considering it are:
1) I would love to take the time to focus purely on studying things like stats, machine learning, NLP, the latest database technologies etc. full time. Even if it made no difference to my career I feel like a year or two spent studying something I'm really interested in would be time well spent.
2) I don't have a formal education in anything technical/quantitative. So far I've got by through self-teaching, but feel would feel out of my depth moving into a more heavily analytical role without either taking some time out to self-teach, or doing formal study.

Would a Masters be a waste of time and money - should I just carry on with self-study &amp; online courses? 
I could equally find a Tableau contracting role with good money and fewer hours than my current job, and using the extra time to study, or I could even become full time unemployed to study by myself - would this be unattractive to future employers?
