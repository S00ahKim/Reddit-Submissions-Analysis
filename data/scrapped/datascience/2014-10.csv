I have a method for training the model and would like to see if Im on the right track.

**Details:**

The definition of a lapsed customer is given by the professor (basically someone who hasnt made a transaction for some set amount of time). I am provided 4 months of fictional transaction data for training and some customer attributes.

My method for training the model is to calculate whether a customer is lapsed or not (using the provided definition) after 4 months and then to make the same calculation using only 3.5 months of data. Lets call these vectors Lapse4 and Lapse3.5 respectively.

Then I would run a variety of models (logistic regression, trees, discriminant analysis, etc.) on the following specification:

Lapse4 ~ Lapse3.5 + (other independent variables in dataset)

The key assumption is that I would be using 3.5 months of data for all of the independent variables and predicting the dependent variable status (Lapse4) at 4 months. 

Im not so much interested in the exact form of the regression specification or exact modeling technique to use. I would more like to know if this general approach is valid in approaching this problem.

**Next Steps:**

If this approach is correct: I would use a confusion matrix and calculate accuracy, precision, and recall to compare different models against each other.

The next step will be the professor providing a test data set that I will test the model on. Any and all feedback/suggestion would be helpful!",1,3,False,default,,,,,

The full HTML file can be found [here](http://pastebin.com/8q67HUY2).

So, as an example. Let's take the following quote:


    &lt;article class=quote id=p-69639971710&gt;
    &lt;p class=meta&gt;&lt;span class=date&gt;12/10/13 18:43:00&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a class=llink href=../posts/69639971710.html&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=http://quotes.dilanka.cc/post/69639971710 rel=canonical&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be truly walking on the warrior&amp;#8217;s path, we have to bring our minds back to the time when we were not ashamed of our dreams; when reality had not yet frustrated our ambitions; when our desire was still too strong to be repressed, and our spirit refused to surrender in resignation; when we were not yet doctors, businessmen, or lawyers, but still wanted to be heroes, leaders, bodhisattvas. The first step on the way to being warriors is to get back in touch with our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daniele Bolelli, &lt;a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Path-Second-Edition-Philosophy/dp/158394219X/?tag=692-20"" target=""_blank""&gt;On the Warrior&amp;#8217;s Path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=tags&gt;#daniele bolelli #self responsibility #wisdom #life #spirituality #fighting #martial arts #combat #ambition #self esteem #self belief #joe rogan&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;

From the above quote, I want the following segments extracted into a neat CSV OR a database or some other portable format that is scalable (over 10,000+ quotes).

[QUOTE]

*To be truly walking on the warrior&amp;#8217;s path, we have to bring our minds back to the time when we were not ashamed of our dreams; when reality had not yet frustrated our ambitions; when our desire was still too strong to be repressed, and our spirit refused to surrender in resignation; when we were not yet doctors, businessmen, or lawyers, but still wanted to be heroes, leaders, bodhisattvas. The first step on the way to being warriors is to get back in touch with our dreams.*

[TITLE]

*On the Warrior&amp;#8217;s Path*


[TAGS]

*#daniele bolelli #self responsibility #wisdom #life #spirituality #fighting #martial arts #combat #ambition #self esteem #self belief #joe rogan*

Ideally, instead of saving the Author, Title and Link separately, I would like to keep those three AS IT IS so it is in this format: **Daniele Bolelli, [On the Warriors Path](http://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Path-Second-Edition-Philosophy/dp/158394219X/?tag=692-20)**

Potential problems:

* Some quotes or text posts are quite long with spaces and html formatting inserted by tumblr, not sure how I could parse these properly.
* How can I separate paragraphs and keep those intact?
* How can I store the ""tags"" in such a way that I can use those to search my database/dataset by keywords? Also, how can I differentiate between #john doe and # john doe? (the extra space)
* I am sure there are other potential problems I am unaware of ...so if you can help, I'd appreciate it.

I live in Los Angeles so there are lots of tech companies around, do I just email their HR departments?

I'm also looking in to the possibility of doing my bachelor project on behalf of a company (my university is supportive of such initiatives), and possibly use that as a way to get an internship. How would I go about getting in touch with the right people and the right companies? I would love to have an internship under my belt before I start grad school so I have a decent shot at getting a job while completing it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm currently attending a top university where I would like to pursue a career in data science. I dabbled in courses like business, economics, python, and statistics to get a feel for it. However, I never connected the dots together to see how they relate. And I think Data Science very interesting because it is an interdisciplinary study where I can enjoy a variety of things together. 

I wouldn't consider myself an expert in anything, but I'm smart enough and driven enough to understand the details and do the best I can.

So, I have a dilemma. I have options to double major or minor with a major that would help me understand the fundamentals of data science.  

I understand that Data Scientists must need strong programming skills, so majoring in CS is a no brainer. However, the CS major here is capped. In addition, Operation Research also sounded like a possible major I can see myself doing,however, that too is also a capped major where I would need to apply to get accepted. Lastly, Statistics an open major but I'm not quite sure how much advanced Statistics I would need.

I am currently in the process of clearing the prerequisites so I can apply to these majors, however, I was wondering what courses I should focus more on. Double majoring seems like a tough decision regardless of any majors I choose in any colleges, but I would like some feedbacks on what people would choose. 

For some odd reasons Statistics with CS minor seems appealing because  of CS seems like more of your ability rather than a degree itself. However, from my research they prefer Statisticians with Ph.D or some advanced degrees. And I'm not quite sure about Operations Research but it does seem to lean on more practical statistics which I like.

Thanks all in advance.

2. Parallel Algorithms - High performance and parallel computation. I'd say this is most relevant to my current research project
3. Bayesian Statistics methods - Markov chain monte carlo, Bayes models. 
4. Applied Regression - linear/logistic regression, residuals, data analysis. 
5. Numerical analysis of DEs - with cover numerically solving ODEs and PDEs. I'm thinking this won't be that helpful since my current numerical analysis course covers this, but very lightly
6. Statistical methods II -  random and mixed effects models, time series, survival analysis, Bayesian methods, and MANOVA. Emphasis on using statistical software.

I am a software developer, having graduated with a degree in Computer Science 5 years ago. That said, I only took one statistics course along the way and didn't do so well in it. I didn't pick up on the different types of distributions mainly. 

I'm a huge sports fan and absolutely love Moneyball (the book and the movie). I learned how to do Monte Carlo Simulations long ago and have written apps to simulate baseball and football games. But I want to learn quite a bit more and get into the field of data science because it's something that's always fascinated me. People like Nate Silver can accurately predict elections based on data, and that's the kind of thing I want to do. 

I know that there is a big overlap with Economics, but I didn't do so well in that either in high school, and I didn't have any course in college. I have read a bit about R and used it very sparingly, and I've built databases in the past (although I could use some work getting things in Normal Forms). 

I was wondering if anyone had any pointers about here to start, what books to read (or websites that would provide the same material), etc. in order to become a data scientist. If it will require more statistics than I can currently do, etc. 
 
Thanks so much in advance!",3,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm looking for advice regarding the upcoming start of the Data Science Specialization courses offered by Coursera.

I'd like to know if the signature track is worth the money that they ask for it ($49 for each one IIRC).

Also I'd love to hear your opinion regarding how many courses I'd follow at the same time.

I achieved a MSc in Aero-Astro Eng. and know how to program both in python and in Matlab and I'm really interested in this field.

What do you think about this??

EDIT: I just wanted to thank you for your answers! In the end I think that I'll do the signature track to have a (very) strong motivation of completing the courses",26,13,False,self,,,,,

I already read several posts in this subreddit about people asking how to become employable for data science positions; the thing is, they almost always had at least a computer science and/or a math degree to justify their skills.

I'm coming from a different background: I graduated two years ago from one of France's top social science schools with a masters in Marketing. I've been working for 2 years at a medium-sized social media agency, and I'm now managing the social media team - which includes performance analysis, but nothing really fancy, mathematically speaking.

Being bored of social media, I *really* want to change path as soon as possible and enter the data science field. So far:

* On the computer science side, I'm far from being completely clueless (I've been using HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL for several years on side projects). I'm currently learning R, and I'm about halfway through the [Data Science specialization track on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage).

* On the statistics part, I'm finishing [Duke University's course on data analysis and statistical inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics)

I don't plan on looking for a job right now, but I'll be leaving Paris to go to London in september 2015. I could probably take another social media job there, but I'd really wish to find my first data science job instead :)

My questions:

* Do you think I'll ever be employable as a data scientist without any actual CS/math degree? Will some companies be okay with hiring someone who has learned R and statistics (and more?) only through online classes?

* In order to become more employable, what other topics/languages shoud I learn first? Python? Hadoop? Java? more statistics?

Thanks a lot!",19,22,False,self,,,,,
