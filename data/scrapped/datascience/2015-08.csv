I need some advice. I'm about to start an MS degree that combines cs, stats, and economics. It's at a top school and the program is very much expected to train me very well to become a good data scientist (that can do more than just code). Right now, I work on data projects with R, Python, and other more development tools like Django, HTML, CSS, etc. I have taken many stats courses so I already know quite a bit of theory, but expect the MS to teach me more. 

Anyway, I currently have a few projects going on:  I work for a professor as an RA (not too many hours), have a contracting gig for a few hours doing some of that data development stuff, and will maybe get some hours working at a data science shop in my city. 

Cue a few weeks ago. I got an email from the CTO of a 3-month old start up. He said he saw my github and was interested in me as a data science lead position. I don't have unicorn-level code in my github but whatever... I was clear that I would not be able to work more than 15hours a week (but I'm aware how startup culture is), especially after they wanted to schedule meetings at 7pm. They hope to get funding later on, but if I take this on now, I'm going into it knowing that $$ probably won't come out of it. They seem to have a good head on their shoulders (even though they are young 20s (so am I)), and they have a very good product idea. I'm not sure they have much of an idea of what I could do with their data, but they are looking ahead to what can be done. They asked if I wanted to later on be a lead role, and sure, sounds nice, even though I still feel I can learn so much more. 

My question is:  is it worth taking up this opportunity with all of my other commitments? There will not be money involved, but would having a lead position, a position to play around with data and say what's going to happen, be beneficial right now, early in my career? Is the opportunity cost of not getting paid here v. maybe getting more paid hours elsewhere (but at more of an ""intern"" level) worth it?

Thanks for any thoughts!",17,5

We're working on analyzing the data that we have to (eventually) predict infrastructure problems and failures. We 1. need the historic information digitized and 2. need a way to collect future information. 

Wondering 2 things. First, does anyone have a recommendation about tackling thousands and thousands of pages of data that is all on paper. Second, if we develop a process for collecting the historic and future data, would you recommend building a full database or just having go-to spreadsheets that could then potentially be cleaned and analyzed and maybe run through an ETL process. I have a couple of ideas about directions to go, but am more concerned about biting off more than I can chew - especially since there aren't many others that could offer help from within the organization (and we don't have tons of money to hire people to do it for us).

I explore them through the following questionnaire (which I send to candidates before we chat, so that they have time to look things up):

1. Have you ever heard of hypothesis testing?
    * If so, what is a p-value?
    * Neyman-Pearson vs. Fischer?
2. Do you know what type-I (type-II) error is?
3. What are the distributions / is the distribution of p-value's, in general?
4. Have you ever seen the Weak law of large numbers?
5. Have you ever seen the Central Limit Theorem?
6. Have you ever seen Bayes Theorem?
7. Do you know what a conjugate-prior is?
8. Do you know what the exponential family is?
9. Have you ever heard of the dirichlet distribution?
10. Have you ever heard of the multinomial distribution?

I'd love to hear people's comments and/or critique of this list. Is there anything I should add? What would you take off, and why?

***Edit:*** Thanks for all the feedback, but I think there was a subtle misunderstanding here. This isn't the _only_ part of the interview, nor is it the only stage in our application process. The ""practical portion"" of our application is a link to github repo with a modelling challenge described in the repo README.MD.

Towards this like, some people have properly identified this as something of a ""first semester in graduate-level statistics"" (or for Europeans &amp; Canadians, ""an advanced undergraduate statistics course""). Indeed, that's basically what it is. The practical part of the application can test if you can do the daily stuff (EDA, model comparison, use git, etc.). This screen is supposed to tell me more about what happens when we get in to the less common edge cases. E.g., I need you to build me an A/B testing framework, or create an (or implement a documented) uplift-estimation procedure and explain to the rest of the team why it works, etc.

I'm taking a class next semester on Statistical Computing, aka R. I want to put some stuff on my resume with R as well as genuinely get experience with the language on projects, since I see myself using it in the foreseeable future. 

My school luckily is a large research university; research assistant positions are relatively easy to find (but that doesn't mean that they'll be meaningful positions). I found a short list of teachers whose research looks very interesting in the CS &amp; Biostats departments. They all deal with data analysis &amp; decision making

I'm just curious if this is the best way to get experience working on R, both professionally (something on a resume) and educationally (actually knowing how to use the language). I'm hoping a professor would begin by giving me some data sets work on and clean, all the while giving me exposure to the kind of work a data scientist would be involved in. As I complete my course on R, I hope he/she work into a more involved role

The risks I see is just that I don't know any of the professors I'm about to contact. I found their names because a fellow intern did a summer program involving Biostats Research. I was wondering if anyone here who has done research found it a useful experience for the industry

Also, would a business school use R for any research (Is it a factor in Technology &amp; Operations, Marketing, or Finance)? The CS &amp; Biostats departments have plenty of grad students doing research. The Business school has less grad students and much more $$$$, so they might have more meaningful positions for projects with plenty of funding. I may be able to find a stronger position there, but am not sure if any of them leverage data science",3,1

Since I want to work as a data scientist, would I be disqualified from alot of companies if I drop out w/o the master's?

I've been picking up most of my skills by picking bits of different MOOCs, but I now feel I've spread my skills a bit too thin. Most of the data mining and manipulation I can do in R, but some I can do better in Excel. I can do some Python (a bit of webscraping), but I can't do anything with data structures or machine learning with it. I'm mostly fine with SQL and MDX and can do a bit of data mining with SAAS. The only machine learning I know how to really do is using Matlab from that Andrew Ng course on coursera.

I feel like I've just ended up with this hotchpotch of different abilities, spread around too many different applications, that makes performing actual, useful work a bit useless.

I'm wondering how many other people have found themselves in this situation, and whether I'd be better off mostly abandoning all the tools but one for now, till I get my abilities consolidated (but accepting that I won't be able to do as much)?

I'm also wondering whether I should stop relying on MOOCs, and instead pick up more in-depth textbooks focused on just my chosen tool?",13,0

I have a small project in mind that I'd love to use as my first taste of data science.

A friend of mine runs a business where he's interviewed hundreds of people to perform a certain task.  The business isn't stock trading, but you could think of it as a similar type of industry.

I'd like to use stats or machine learning, or whatever you'd recommend to accomplish the following:

Data / inputs available:

- chat logs from when he spoke to them over instant messenger/skype/etc before being accepted.  I'd like to do some kind of vocabulary/word analysis to see if there are any trends that indicate winners/losers/cheaters/fraudsters  (though non-native english speakers might make this difficult)
- we can come up with some basic metadata about the applicants, such as age, education, current major, etc

Results data:

- We will have a net win/loss number in dollars
- We will also have an amount of time they worked
- Some people will have simply disappeared with the money

What algorithms / software libraries / statistical models should I look for?

In the end I'd like to come up with some kind of score for potential future candidates based on their chat interviews and info.  We have a sample size of maybe 150-200 past clients at the moment.

I want to recommend movies with a user-based Naive Bayes Calculation, but I think it's not correct. I tried to use this as an example at page 11 http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/CE/Bayesian%20Classification%20withInsect_examples.pdf and I only have these attributes, it should be totally user-rating-based and not work with any additional data.

I only have 2 classes, Like and Disslike

Bob:

Like | Disslike
----|--------
Titanic | Superman
Up |Batman
Mad Max |

Alice:

Like | Disslike
----|--------
Superman | Titanic
Up |MadMax
Batman |

Charlie:

Like | Disslike
----|--------
Superman| Titanic
 |Batman


These are the ratings, now I want to recommend Charlie a Movie. So I calulate if he would like ""Up""

**1/All unique Movies I have**

1/5 = 0,2

**Up was liked x many times/User count**

2/3 = 0.667

**All user/All ratings that were made**

3/13 = 0.230

**Now I can calulate:**

(0.2 x 0.667) / 0.230 = 0.58 Score

So Charlie would more like the movie than disslike it.

Thoughts, why I think that I'm missing something:

I didn't do anything with disslikes!
It seems that it's not a personal recommendation, because I don't calculate Charlies taste at all.

I'm currently earning my master's in MIS with Drexel University Online.  Next term is my last term, and I'm trying to figure out which class to choose in order to best position myself for future professional development in pursuit of the skills of a data scientist.  With my background being what it is, I think I would be lucky to earn my way into a job as a data analyst.  My undergraduate degree was in psychology, and outside of what little math skills I've picked up so far in my MIS program (mostly in software project financial analysis), I have a long ways to go towards developing my abilities and my literacy with math and programming.

&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR** Today, I mainly need advice for how I should wrap up my studies with Drexel.  I'm trying to decide between taking a challenging class in Database Warehousing (with a good professor) or a reputably easy class introducing Healthcare Informatics (with a reputably bad professor/ lax grader).  I only need to take one class next term to fulfill my requirements for graduating.

&amp;nbsp;

The way I see it now, I can either take the hard class, and focus all my time on building up my knowledge of SQL and the work of database developers /administrators which would help my chances of getting a job in a corresponding area upon graduating.  Otherwise, if I take the class on Healthcare Informatics, I can spend most of the term developing my abilities in another analytics-focused skill area.  I was thinking about spending the ten weeks in a self-taught, or perhaps, MOOC-driven crash course in Python (which I've always wanted to learn, but haven't had the time) or to spend ten weeks studying statistics from the ground up (I've already started Andy Field's: Discovering Statistics Using R).  The disadvantage of spending more time studying statistics I think is that my job prospects right out of school would be less favorable compared to having working proficiency with a competitive technical skill.  One last point in favor of this choice is that having taken the class in healthcare informatics, I would potentially be in better standing to accept a job at a hospital as a minor programmer or as a systems analyst, and then be able to work my way up into serious healthcare analytics down the road.

&amp;nbsp;

If you're still following along with this post, let me take this opportunity to be a bit more specific about the data warehousing class.  It's called Applied Database Technologies.  Here's the course description:

&amp;nbsp;

*This course covers principles and techniques related to data warehousing &amp; OLAP
technologies as well as Oracle PL/SQL programming. We will cover PL/SQL programming including stored procedures &amp; functions, packages, and triggers. Topics for data warehousing include dimensional modeling and design, OLAP, ROLAP/MOLAP, aggregation, ETL, physical data warehouse design, optimization techniques such as partitioning, bit map indexing, multi-table join indexing, star schema query optimization, and materialized views.*

&amp;nbsp;

Seems to me like a solid class, and I would most assuredly have some fresh SQL / database skills right out of school.  Also in favor of this option is that I currently understand that the field has a greater need for those who don't just know statistics, but can also 'engineer' database systems.  I don't know if anyone can comment on whether the course description above is in line with this possible shortage of skill, but I learned of this on Quora in a guide posted by a Data Science undergraduate, Alex Kamil.  Item 10 of the guide states:

&amp;nbsp;

*10) Study Engineering*

*I'd go for CS with a focus on either IR or Machine Learning or a combination of both and take some systems courses along the way. As a ""data scientist"" you will have to write a ton of code and probably develop distributed algorithms/systems to process massive amounts of data. MS in Statistics will teach you how to do modeling and regression analysis etc, not how to build systems, I think the latter is more urgently needed these days as the old tools become obsolete with the avalanche of data. There is a shortage of engineers who can build a data mining system from the ground up. You can pick up statistics from books and experiments with R (see item 3 above) or take some statistics classes as a part of your CS studies.*

&amp;nbsp;

Last, I thought I should wrap this up by explaining why I'm interested in this field in the first place.  I'm basically dead set on participating in some way in the field of educational technologies or in the emerging field of learning analytics.  I believe  delivering accessible, personalized, and effective online education to the masses is one of the most important opportunities data science has to offer the world.  Initially, I was concerned that applied data science might stumble in its ability to serve people this way, and that learning analytics was more hot air than substance, but it appears I was wrong now that some very promising start-ups which personalize educational experiences in lieu of leveraging data analytics are actually receiving some credibility in the form of large venture capital (for example, Acrobatiq).  That is at least, very exciting for me, and something I would love to be a part of.

&amp;nbsp;

So that sums it up; I'm mainly writing in to ask your advice on whether I should take a tough class that will teach me how to build databases and perform OLAP or whether I should take a breezey intro class on Healthcare Informatics and use the time to learn Python (and as much stats as I can manage).

&amp;nbsp;

Please feel free to point out anything about my background that would make this path hellishly difficult for me or those around me.  Reality is hard: I realize my background isn't in CS, but I'm trying to make the best of what I can.  Thanks in advance for hearing me out on this, and I very much appreciate any input!

I was hoping someone might be able to help me make sense of a couple of homework questions. I am not looking for someone to just tell me the solution, mind you, just wondering if anyone would be able to explain the question a bit more simply for me, as I am new to data analysis and enrolled in an R class which had no prerequisites, but feel a bit lost with some of the language. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

So, the first part of the 1st question was to create an array and fill it with random numeric data, which I did here:

question &lt;- array( 1:1000, dim= c(25,4,1000))
colnames(question)&lt;- c('x1','x2','x3','x4')

Now, the second part asks me to ""write a function to create y-values,"" which should be a ""linear combination"" of the four variables. The example given is

y = 2  x1 + 5  x2  3  x3 + 0.7  x4 + RandomError.

The question adds that the result should be a matrix with dimensions of 25  1000. I am not sure what exactly this is asking or how to approach this problem. All I have so far, which I know is very little is

apply(question,c(1,3),sum)
function (y){ ...

Can anyone offer any guidance or clarification? Thank you so much!



The second question I have is about implementing the Newton-Raphson in R. Being totally new to all of this, with little math background, I am a bit lost. I understand that this method is trying to find closer and closer approximations of the roots of a function, but beyond that I am lost. The questions asks me to program a function that implements the Newton-Raphson method to find the solution of the following equation: x^3 + 2x^2 - 7 = s. The question goes on to say that the function should take 3 arguments: s (value s takes in equation), x (first guess for the solution), and iterations (number of iterations method should go through). 

I know this is asking a lot but I would be so grateful for any kind of help you can offer. Thank you so much.",6,0

As you can probably infer from the title, i'm a new coder interested in starting in data science. As of now, I have probably gotten around 2-3 weeks of python experiene (enough for the basics) and i'm now looking for something else to do. I've watched a couple of videos on other uses of python (Flask, Django) and can't get myself into it. In high school, AP stats was one of my favorite classes and I absolutely loved working with data so data science with python seemed like a no-brainer. However, after doing a fair bit of research, it seems like there is a lot of formal education needed to actually get started in data science. For example, i'm currently heading into multivar and plan to take linear algebra next quarter and i'm not even sure when I might take machine learning. Even the kaggle competitions seem a bit daunting with all these terms.

I guess my real question is: Am I too inexperienced right now to try data science? 

For people who think I am, what would you suggest someone who has finished basic python do now? What new frameworks, languages, or fields should I pursue?

Hey all. Take a deep breath and try not to react too violently... Ready?  
  
I'm a Data Scientist recruiter.  
  
If you haven't already thrown your computer out the window in revulsion, hear me out:  
I know - recruiters are terrible, especially when it comes to Data Science. I've gotten InMails trying to engage *me* for ""Data Scientist"" positions. Yikes... Unlike a lot of recruiters, I don't really see the appeal of being fast, sloppy, and full of shit. I don't take on fake Data Science roles, and if a potential candidate doesn't fit the right profile, I see no reason to waste anyone's time with a phone call only to never appear again. I'll be honest about what you're missing long before we get to that point.  
  
**I know that as a qualified Data Scientist, you have no shortage of opportunities. However, I also know that the job market is a minefield of junky ""Data Scientist"" positions. It can take until the on-site to realize there's no actual support for data-driven decision making at the firm. It's never fun when you realize that some exciting ""Director of Data Science"" role is actually ""Director of Arguing With The CEO To Gain Meager Support for Analytics"". You have options, but do you have time to wade through that much garbage to find a legitimate opportunity?**  
  
I work for a wide variety of clients across the US. Everything from Fortune 50 firms (including big ole #1) to 6-person startups. Location, industry, job level, and everything else varies, but they're all Data Science roles. I've placed Data Scientists at world-leading video game publishers, retailers, up and coming Ad Tech SaaS firms, jobs that make me very jealous and critical of my own dumb recruiter work. Right now I'm working on openings with 2 out of the Big Three management consultancies.  
  
  
If you have experience grappling with massive unstructured, streaming, or otherwise difficult data to perform predictive analytics and derive business insights, I'd love to hear more. Even if you're not looking for a change, we might as well connect. It never hurts to network! Shoot me a PM with your LinkedIn profile, and if we could benefit from a chat, I'll set up a call.  
  
----
Note: Some of my colleagues work on more ""traditional"" Predictive Analytics roles that don't require the coding or unstructured data wrangling experience, so even if you're not a fit for any of my roles, I very well may be able to connect you with someone who has more relevant options. Shoot me a PM.

Alot of these are manually labeled, from the start I had 2408 NewsDesk values as NaN
but I can manually identify values to their NewsDesk/SectionName. After doing it manually I'm down to 1200 NaN values. Or replace the manually added entirely with the ones done from the LDA model...

And my thinking was that using LDA on the remaining 1200 to identify the rest.
But I'm having issues implementing this.

How would you implement LDA on this dataset? (Perhaps you wouln't even use LDA, and if so what would you use?)

However last summer I attended a university open day at Warwick where they first introduced me to the idea of a Data Science degree, upon further reading I noted not only these two very current ideas, but also machine learning linear algebra matrices etc. All of which are right up my street in terms of my maths and computer science. I have already been doing a lot of python in my own time and it was the language I used in my AS level, therefore I am quite aware of its capabilities in dealing with data and statistical models. 

My question then really: what insight can you offer to someone as young as myself who only has the internet and my books as a resource? Is data science really as expansive and.. Relevant as it seems? To me it really does seem that all science will become data science and yet it is still quite a new field, meaning getting into it would be a smart thing to do? What kind of small projects could/should I work on to further my knowledge and maybe show off a bit on my personal statement when applying to university. This is where ive come stuck as I have done a couple of MOOC's to learn coding, analysis and mechanics (separate interest haha) but the only 'good' data science one I can find is a rather long one on coursera which sadly finished last year meaning I cant get credit. The video lectures in it are great though!

So I am a post-bacc student currently applying to various PhD programs this fall, and I hope to gain admission to those with quantitative psychology programs (or at least quant minors with cognition or neuropsych as the primary). I am pursuing this out of my fascination with human decision making, both on the macro and micro level, because I find that to be the primary lens through which I view the world. I want to understand why my dad makes the foolish decisions he does provided his bevy of education. I want to understand why I decide on certain interests which seem to change every year. I want to learn and assist those in learning about why groups make decisions (public policy driven research or even data on consumer personal interests). 

In college, I earned a degree in the humanities (English and Philosophy) but as I matured became fascinated by decision making in psychology and on a larger scale. Since then, I've been hoofing it to acquire as many skills, experiences, publications (hopefully plural and not singular here), and relationships so that I can enter a PhD program and eventually, an industry. I am not closed off to academia long-term, but it is simply not my interest currently. 

**TL;DR** - I hold a rather unconventional background in the field, and wanted to gather data (classic comedy) on what my moves to progressing in the field of data science should be? I'm learning as many programming languages as I can (Python, Java, and R, at the moment) but are there more constructive steps to set me up on the otherside of my PhD, or even to help improve my chances with a Quant Psych PhD program admission?

Thanks! I will gladly forward my CV for any further specifics! ",1,1

I have a set of data that I'm trying to clean up by using the weka gui.  I've been trying a few things over the past couple of hours and at one point I had a decision tree root relative squared error of 30%.  Then my computer promptly crashed and I've been trying to replicate what I did for a while with no luck.  All my other models have RRSE ~85-90%.

Here's what I've tried so far, with different combinations in the order of execution:

* Running classifierSubsetEvaluation and CfsSubsetEval both with GreedyStepwise and BestFirst.  I vaguely remember that the one time I had a lower error rate it was because I deleted a few attributes but I cna't remember what those were.
* Discretization of sparse numerical data into various sized bins, both equal width and equal depth have been tried.
* ReplaceMissingValues
* I merged a small set of miscategorized data in one of the attributes (I couldn't figure out how to delete specific instances without opening the arff file and searching for them which seems unnecessarily tedious).

I have the feeling I'm  missing something big but I'm not sure what.  I'm very new to this so any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",8,2

What I would like to do is to find the subset of group 0 that look the most likely to perform this action, thus moving from group 0 to group 1.

It isn't clear to me what is the best approach to this at all - I started by training a classifier on a subset of my data to distinguish between the two groups. This classifier was then be run over the remainder of the data and I looked at those members of group 0 that were misclassified as being in group 1 (or for which the classifier had a lower probability for their membership in group 0), but this really don't seem to be a sensible approach. Obviously part of what this will be doing is finding a way to reject the 'group 1-like' members of group 0, and these are the individuals I'm really interested in.

Are there any better alternatives? Really what I want is to train a model to find the 'group 1-like' entries in the entire dataset.

Going against me: no working experience, unfamiliarity with Hadoop and other std. industry tools, age, and a current salary of ~$60k (I'm willing to take a pay-cut for advancement opportunities).

Further down the road, I want to pursue an MBA. Are there opportunities for leadership and project management in data science?

I would appreciate any help or advice. Thanks!!

EDIT: Thanks again to everyone! I feel much more confident about sending out some resumes and pursuing this career.",10,4

These include song titles, views, likes/dislikes, nr of comments. 

I want to write a formula that will get me the ""best"" song (using collective intelligence) of this certain artist. What do you think would be the best approach?

I was thinking something like:  var X = (likes/total views) +(comments/total views) - (dislikes/total views)

(Or comments*2 because a comment could be worth more than a like.)

Then, the song with the largest X might be the ""best"".

Suggestions are welcomed

I was wondering if anyone knew the differences between what its like working as a data scientist or analyst compared to life in grad school (for phD or MS with thesis) in terms of working hours and stress levels? I know grad school is quite stressful in that you have to work 60-80 hrs/wk not just for the thesis, but also coursework and TA-ships. And from what I've heard about data scientists, they typically work at least 50 hours/wk, but I'm not sure how accurate that is",6,7

Git and/or alternatives.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3j1yw5/workflow_tracking_for_data_science_git_andor/,vegetableagony,1441002788,"I use git to track the scripts and code that I write, but I find that there are some things that I would like to be tracking about my workflow that I don't know of a good way to do in git.

In particular I often have a sequence of long running scripts (several hours or days) that are involved in creating all the outputs/analyses that I need. e.g. 
Script A -&gt; Script B -&gt; Script C

Script A takes a long time to run, so if I discover a minor problem while looking at the output I may not want to wait for the updated Script A to finish running, so I continue on with the other scripts so that I at least have preliminary results to show. 

The result of this is that it's sometimes hard to determine exactly which versions of each script was run to generate a given output. I keep a ""lab notebook"" that records every step I take, but it's still generally a pretty painful process to manually construct the exact sequence of steps that created a given table/graph.


Questions: 
1) Is there a good way to track this sort of information using git?
2) Does anyone else run into problems like this? How do you handle it?
3) Are there any alternative tools that are good for tracking this.",6,4
