It seems that all my data products are one-off ad-hoc stuff--either reports for my managers or new datasets that don't really integrate back into my environment.  It seems that there's a big disconnect between what I do and what the DBA/BI people do, and it's hard to communicate.

Just to give you an idea, I work with mostly relational databases and OLAP cubes.  These answer a lot of the ""repeating"" business questions that slices an dices the data.  Sure, they can get pretty complex with the data mining stuff, but it's a pretty rigid environment.

On the other hand, I work to add more challenging, non-repeatable questions that typically add an extra dimension or two to my datasets.  Things like ""should we change our business strategy due to the government shutdown?""  (not working on this specific question but just to give you an example).

Here's my challenge--I usually have my products sitting in my own database somewhere or stored in a few documents/spreadsheets for my boss to digest.  (As an aside, I'm looking to present my findings using d3 or maybe tableu if they'll buy the license).  It seems a little silly to segregate this without somehow enriching our current data warehouse.

What do you guys do?",4,6
