As part of my DS work I spend some fraction of my time helping the team make growth projections, either for setting growth targets or when forecasting actual data.

There is obviously a range of ways to go about doing this but the one thing I don't have a good solution for at the moment is being able to fold in or at least quantify how much harder it is to grow in a market this year as opposed to historical years.  It is easy to anchor growth on historical rates but in markets at which you've got a solid penetration already it is likely a harder task to maintain a historical level of growth than it was to achieve that level the first time around.

I've thought about a few approaches that basically involve taking the derivative of a growth curve to look at the rate of change of growth, but it is hard to know if that is really probing the truth of how much harder it is to grow, or if its just that we're doing a worse job and growing more slowly!

Does anyone have a good approach to either measuring some sort of 'growth friction' for a current year vs historical years, or perhaps some other forecasting technique that allows information about this to be folded in somehow?

I'm an aspiring data scientist.

My background:
I work in software test automation at a Fortune 500 company. My degree is in business and I had a 2.8 GPA (lots of regrets, lazy student). I'm a self-taught programmer and I have been teaching myself machine learning and data science through books, MOOC's and DataCamp. I've got R and Python projects for data science on my GitHub (albeit simple projects). I keep a blog on my data science journey and I'm working on starting a machine learning and data science meetup in Columbus, Ohio. I'm trying to pick between three ways of getting into data science.

First Option:
I was planning to return to school for mathematics. I found a program through Indiana University that would allow me to continue working full-time while finishing a B.S. part time in mathematics. I would then, hopefully, move into getting a M.S. in Statistics. This plan would likely take 5 years and I likely wouldn't have to take out loans (I make good $$ and we have a good tuition reimbursement program at my company)

Second Option:
Pursue a M.S. in Data Science through Indiana University. [Here is the program curriculum.] (https://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/data-science/graduate/courses.html) There's also the program through UIUC, but my GPA is too low. I've already spoken with IU and the fact that I'm driven to do this work and have projects is bonus, but not a guarantee that I would get in. This program would allow me to also keep working and would take 2 years.

Third Option:
Get a MBA in Business Analytics. This would be the easiest program for me to get into, but the one which I'm the most apprehensive about.

I'm being considered for data scientist role because of general/other qualifications rather than my experience with data science.. Yet, badly want to convert this and am open to all advice and helpful tips, resources, ideas, tools, techniques, etc

Please help me understand:
&gt; Which type algorithms would they use/test me on- I know this is in the Public/Private Investment space and they want me to work on core investment portion as well as web analytics portion. I mean, Regression would be popular here but apart from that, what are other must know algorithms- PCA, Random Forest, Naive Bayes classifiers, or others??

&gt; Lets say I have decided on three algorithms to focus on: Regression, Random Forest, Neural Nets. How deep into the theory should I go? I would have to know how they work, the assumptions made in each, pros/cons/strengths/weakness/when each algorithm should be applied, but what else? How would I understand most common errors, things people ask for, etc. Should I be able to write down mathematical equations &amp; proofs? How much depth should I aim to get into? Are you aware of any good helpful resources for me to acquire said amount of depth in these algorithms? I know there's a tonne out there, but asking for stuff that's simple in language for entry folk to understand yet cover deep portions..

&gt; While I plan to be honest about how much experience I have with data, I certainly dont want to appear like a book-worm or missing obvious stuff what working on projects give you.. Can you advice me on what stuff typically differentiates a college rookie from a person of industry experience? Any helpful blogs, articles, books, videos, courses, etc- here??

&gt; Finally, I have basic web development experience in Python-Django. I've also played around pandas and matplotlib. I tried scikit but didn't get it going for some reason. I've done these in a limited capacity. Because of this, I want to focus on Python as preferred option (if they quiz me on syntax, practical demonstration, etc). What pieces of the puzzle should I practice before going? Eg: I know I will have to brush up on inputting/outputting data from/to various formats, pickling, running core algorithm, interpretting results, and outputting them in fancy ways. What else? What are the nuances of running the algorithms in these libraries? For example: In regression, I've ran regression in excel, spss, and python. Each time simply running them and getting the results. But is there a way to run regression from the reducing cost function point of view, by varying the value of alpha? Similarly, what other nuances are there/should I be aware of/be able to do? As always, advice and resources welcome here.

I've currently finished two weeks of Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Machine Learning. I'm not sure if this is the one i need to go into detail anymore given lack of time? What are other good courses out there (free ones preferred please)? Tips on how to practice? Any good/free/beginner-yet-good-for-understanding projects on Kaggle? All other advice welcome? I'd be happy to connect on Skype as well. 

Please dont comment with negative/discouraging stuff- thats the last thing I need and you dont know me or my situation.

I know regression only and taking a data science course on Udemy. I'm generally unclear on few things: exploratory data analysis, regularisation, pressure testing different models, determining if something is wrong, acceptable results like is 0.9 R-square too much, and data architecture.

For whatever, you suggest, if you can also state to what proficiency I would need to know the concept, it would be useful (Eg: if I need to learn say cluster analysis or random forests, would I need to know mathematical proofs &amp; steps, etc or just concept+assumptions would be enough?)

So, please help me structure my learning, where to start, how to prioritize, how much to learn in each, etc. Beginner-intermediate-advaced practice problems &amp; data sets will be useful.

Appreciate help. Apologies if my question is too long, broad or too anxious. I want to turn all stones sooner than later.

I'm trying to create 3 convolutional layers with 1 fully connected layer, but I'm having a tough time understanding what's really going on between each layers.

So for example, the shape of my training images dataset is (48400, 28, 28, 1), and some example code:

    batch_size = 16
    patch_size = 5
    depth = 16
    num_hidden = 64
    image_size = 28
    num_labels = 11 # including ""blank images""
    num_channels = 1 # grayscale

    graph = tf.Graph()

    with graph.as_default():
        # input data
        tf_train_dataset = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape = (batch_size, image_size, image_size, num_channels))
        tf_train_labels = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape = (batch_size, num_labels))
        tf_valid_dataset = tf.constant(valid_images)
        tf_test_dataset = tf.constant(test_images)

        # variables
        layer1_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_noraml([patch_size, patch_size, num_channels, depth], stddev = 0.1))
        layer1_biases = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([depth]))

        layer2_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([patch_size, patch_size, depth, depth], stddev = 0.1))
        layer2_biases = tf.Variable(tf.constant(1.0, shape = [depth]))

        layer3_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([patch_size, patch_size, depth, depth], stddev = 0.1))
        layer3_biases = tf.Variable(tf.constant(1.0, shape = [depth]))

        layer4_weights = tf.Varaible(tf.truncated_normal([image_size // 4 * image_size // 4 * depth, num_hidden], stddev = 0.1))
        layer4_biases = tf.Variable(tf.constant(1.0, shape = [num_hidden]))

        layer5_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([num_hidden, num_labels], stddev = 0.1))
        layer5_biases = tf.Variable(tf.constant(1.0, shape = [num_labels]))

This is only a part of the code, but if I try to run this, I get an error saying:

    ValueError: Dimensions 256 and 7854 are not compatible

I'm thinking that layer3 is at fault, since this works if I take layer3 out and work with 2 convolutional layers.  However, I don't understand what's actually going on.  Is it because the size of the kernel is the same as layer2?

Hi /r/datascience,

I'm an undergrad CS major taking a course on big data comprised of mostly masters students. The course has a final project where we use big data tools/frameworks (Spark, Hive, etc.) to perform some sort of analysis on a large dataset. 

For this project, we're allowed to do it on our own or join a team of up to 3 students. As an undergrad (junior) looking for data science roles, I was wondering if it makes any difference whether I join a team or not. On one hand, doing the analysis on my own makes me more familiar with the entire analysis and has me write it all. Conversely, working with a team can show GitHub workflow skills, general responsibility-partitioning, etc.

Those who have been in hiring manager roles or have had this experience: what do? Does it matter at all? Thanks!

**TL; DR:**

""Where do you see yourself 5 years from now"" is a really cliche/kinda worthless question to ask. However, for a data scientist, asking ""where do I see myself 15 years from now"" is actually a very, very important one to answer.

This would be my guidance:

**Align yourself to one of three broad tracks:**

**- Principal Scientist**

**- VP of Data Science**

**- VP of (insert traditional business unit, e.g., Marketing, Supply Chain, Sales)**

These are your three major tracks. They move in (mostly, all other things equal) increasing order of responsibility, soft skills and salary, and decreasing order of hands-on data science work, technical proficiency and job security.

Obviously there are career paths that don't fall in this track, namely starting your own company. But I think that, for most people, this is an accurate set of end-state options.

Becoming a principal scientist means you have likely reached a level where you are the only person alive that knows how certain things work, you are one of two people that can make changes to it, and even the CEO of your company is afraid of what's going to happen when you leave. There may or may not be an emergency plan if you get hit by a bus. As a result, you get to call a lot of your own shots in terms of scope/type of work. On the flip side, there is a ceiling to how much you can be paid because you are not an executive, and executives decide how much money people make (I'm being a bit tongue in cheek here... but only a little bit). You most likely have a PhD, you are most likely incredibly smart, and you most likely don't care too much for people who are not as smart as you. 

Becoming the VP of Data Science means that you now oversee a whole department of data scientists, and yet, you will likely never touch a line of code again. Your time is spent making sure that what your department produces is appropriately valued by the company, and that you can connect company needs and goals with the broad direction your team is taking. You excel at taking complex scientific language and making it palatable to regular people. You are able to convey value to stakeholders, you are able to sell your product, and you are able to do that while also understanding everything your team does at worst one notch below the person who did the work. 
At some point, you were likely a very good data scientist, but what set you apart was not your data science skills - it was standing out as someone who could steal job from your boss by going to meetings, talking to customers, making tough calls, etc. You may or may not have a PhD. You are incredibly sharp. You get along well with most people, but deep down, you judge the crap out of everyone who doesn't have a great understanding of data. You make very good money - but there is always pressure for you to push your team harder and get more results. Lots of travel. Lots of meetings. The biggest drawback? The odds that you'll get promoted to CEO are low, because the traditional functions are always the most likely candidate for that.

Becoming a VP of any other function means that data is no longer your main tool - it's now your secret weapon. You spent the last 10-15 years moving up the ranks and learning how to leverage data to make better business decisions than everyone else. When someone started talking hypotheticals and opinions, you started talking data and facts. And your boss noticed. And your boss' peers noticed. And you started getting invited to more meetings, more projects, and more decision-making events. Now you're managing an entire division of the company, and you're doing it with data on your side - the only way you know how.
You can talk to a wall, you can sit in the room with the heavyweights and you feel perfectly at home there. You know how to play politics, and you kinda like it. You have built a strong team of supporters on the way up - you're good at what you do, so it wasn't that hard.

Which one of these three sounds like the most attractive should certainly shape which decisions you make.

More importantly: you should have a very honest conversation with yourself as to whether or not your strengths align with each specific path, and if not, what you need to do to strengthen your weaknesses.",12,15,False,self,,,,,

I am currently finishing up my bachelor in mathematics and actuarial science, so I have a decent understanding in statistics, finance and programming. I have completed 4 actuarial exams so far. 

I am currently finishing up Andrew Ng's coursera class on machine learning, and I absolutely loved it. I am seriously considering pursuing this career path instead of actuarial science. 

Do you think I have the right profile to make the switch?  I have already used R, MatLab, SAS, VBA and python. My next step would be picking up SQL and try to hone my programming skills on Kaggle. Would I be able to net an entry level job in the field with a few competition under my belt?

I've been learning data science on my own, have been working on a project, all that stuff. However, I wanted to ask about the interview process, specifically how to get interviews in the first place. I'm trying to find a job in the SF bay area.

A lot of people have told me that directly applying to public job listings (like on linkedin, indeed, etc.) is basically a waste of time because there are hundreds and hundreds of applications and recruiters usually screen out all but the most qualified on paper, like people with PhDs and/or a lot of previous experience. I only have an MS and no previous experience in data science itself, although my degrees are in highly relevant fields from pretty good schools. These people tell me to not even bother with it and to focus all my time on networking, getting referrals, etc.

Others have told me that I should basically mass apply to all of those listings because it can't hurt anyway. Of course referrals are more likely to get interviewed, but ""front door"" applications can still work, it's just a numbers game and eventually you'll get lucky.

In fact there was an AMA here recently (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5w1jhk/recently_hired_data_scientist_big_career_change/) where the person said they basically just did that: sent out a ton of front door applications and got 25+ interviews with 5 offers. And they didn't even have a graduate degree, only a bachelor's.

So anyone here with relevant experience, especially if you've recently been hired near San Francisco/Silicon Valley or are a recruiter/hiring manager, what do you think is the best way to proceed, from your experience? Thanks!",5,10,False,self,,,,,

I am finishing my PhD in Biostatistics and Informatics, with a background in Genetics (Although quite lab focused, prior to PhD).
I am worried my portfolio of relevant Projects is a bit small.
I was wondering what to highlight in my CV, and if I can talk about the analytical / statistical aspects of projects earlier in my academic career that were more biology focused.




I also finished 3 research masters degrees that I got full scholarships for, which resulted in 5 projects that are 3 to 10 months long, but only 1 was purely computer based.
I am wondering if I should even mention those master? I essentially see them as jobs, due to full funding for living expenses and all being 80%+ research. But I worry they make me look flimsy and directionless. 


**Projects I think might be worth mentioning (some more than others.)**

1.  Project using Machine Learning to predict Psychiatric disease. (PhD)

2.  Project using Weighted Network analysis to identify Biological Pathways in disease. (PhD)

3. Development of pipeline to process genetic and other biological datasets. (PhD)

4. Machine Learning to predict stress using Fitbit data. (Side project)

5. Coding Bots for simple competitive games in online competitions (Side project)

6. Cross Correlation analysis and statistical analysis of high resolution microscope images., (Mres)

7. Genetic engineering and computer modelling of behaviour (Bacteria). (Won Fancyish award with my team, but only gave biological advice for modelling, while mostly doing lab work)

I have transaction-level sales data from a chain of stores. I.e. I know exactly who bought what, when, at what price, whether there was a discount or some other promotion on that product. Most customers have loyalty cards and thus I know their full purchasing history. Others don't, and then I can only link their purchases within one basket but not across multiple baskets (multiple store visits). Also, there is a hierarchical classification of all products into categories, subcategories and so on. 

Here's what I'm supposed to do:

- for every promotion the store was in the past (e.g. 50% off chicken nuggets for a week) I need to calculate the impact of that promotion. I.e. how many more units of the product were sold because of the promotion than would have been sold otherwise. This is not trivial because sales fluctuate significantly even in the absence of any promotions
- calculate the impact of a promotion on a wider category of product. I.e. if the 200% uplift in chicken nuggets sales was because people saw the promotion and decided to spend more money that week or did they simply bought the promoted chicken instead of other types of meat that they were going to buy (and thus the net gain to the store from the promotion is 0)
- predict for a promotion planned for the future, what its impact is going to be


The old-fashioned way to do this is through time series analysis. You aggregate chicken sales to a weekly level, expecting a more or less smooth curve. If the curve has a peak at the time of promotion then the size of that peak (relative to pre-promotion level) is your sales uplift. This kind of (barely) works, but it's super inaccurate and when you try to judge the impact of a chicken promotion on total meat sales, you get only noise. 

The way I'm trying to do it now is via a customer-level model. You run a great big regression that tries to learn what an individual customer is going to buy over a week. The target is the number of units of chicken nuggets purchased by a customer who has visited a store at least once during the given week. The features are: 

- the customer's demographics
- average spend on chicken in the previous week
- spend on other stuff in the previous weeks
- time of year
- weeks till christmas etc.
- whether there is promotion on chicken
- what is the discount level on chicken
...

The training examples for this regression are all the (customer, product) pairs of customers who could have bought a given product, because they visited the store in a week when it was being sold. This is vastly more than the number of customers that actually bought it. 

When the regression is trained, I can use it to predict how many units of chicken anyone would buy with or without promotion going on. Then I sum it up over all customers and it does a really good job at capturing actual total sales. 

**But.**

I have only managed to do it for individual products in a single store. There are hundreds of thousands of individual products and millions of customers. There is no way that I can scale it to cover every customer-product combination (I'm doing it on a cluster already). There must be some kind of hybrid approach that will utilise the customer-level data (unlike the time-series method) without actually materialising the cartesian product of all customers with all products.

A lot of bioinformatics appears to be narrowed down DS. At any rate, I will graduate with a BS in Informatics with a minor in Computer Science and a minor in Math. 
I will have taken:

1. Linear Algebra, Statistics (for engineers), up to calc 3
2. Data structures and Algorithms, Discrete math, and the third class I haven't taken yet will either be theory of computation or recommender systems
3. Applied Data mining, database design
4. Lots of programming (in order of strength): R/JavaScript, C++, matlab, Java/Php, Perl, Python
5. sql, nosql

Also:

1. I am a TA for scientific programming 
2. In the fall I will TA for server side programming
3. I have interned as a front end web developer and very comfortable with javaSript, github, linux, php, MVC, OOP etc.

The goal is to eventually get a PhD in a program that has a DS with a concentration/track in a certain area perhaps? Like DS + biology. Between the time I will apply to schools I have a gap where I could either:

1. Do a graduate certificate in data mining
2. Do a DS bootcamp
3. Take more random courses (not sure which would be most useful to me...more math?)

I'm not sure which of these 3 options is better. I guess my main 2 questions are, 

* how much direction should I have as far as knowing what domain I want to work in?
* which of the last 3 options do you think would be most beneficial, and what other math do you recommend?

Given the suspicion of foul play, I pulled some satellite imagery of the area that she was last seen in and intend to pull more. My intention would be to do a ""diff"" (to vastly oversimplify the process) to see if there is any difference found either near that time, or something like disturbed earth from one point in time to another. Although I understand how highly unlikely it is to find anything, I would like to try. Although I've searched Google, I've not come across anything imagery related in my studies yet and am coming up empty on the right questions to ask or the right words to use.

I'm looking for advice on how to get into data science as all of my efforts seem to be fruitless. I'm thinking about a masters in stats or analytics, but it seems like people are pretty down on them as a whole.

 I just got B.A. in December in Math (with a stats focus) and a foreign language from a good state school. My undergraduate GPA was a 3.5, with a 3.0 in math (not great, I know.) and a 4.0 in the foreign language (and summa cum laude from research).

I have a year of experience as a research assistant where I wrote Python scripts to analyze large quantities of data using various techniques, including neural networks. I don't necessarily have any ""big data"" experience, however. No external publications, either. I also have experience working as in a physics lab -- but that's not particularly applicable.

I'm great with Python, and OK with SQL and Java. I also have MATLAB experience and a host of other miscellaneous programs that aren't necessarily relevant (LaTeX, etc.). I don't have SAS experience, but I'm working on it.

I've applied for literally hundreds of jobs in my area (a pretty big tech hub) including internships and full-time data science and analytics positions. I've had two callbacks and one in-person interview. On the surface, everyone who I've asked to look at my resume and cover letter thinks that it's pretty good -- as in, there aren't any glaring errors. 

So basically, where the hell do I go from here? I'm planning on applying to my state school's MS in Business Analytics as well as maybe a few other programs, but everyone on here seems to be pretty down on them... Are they worth it if sufficiently technical? The only problem right now is that I should have figured out that I'd need to apply much earlier -- most deadlines have already passed. I just took the GRE today and got V:170 and Q:163. 

Basically, I'm totally at a loss and I have no idea how the hell I'm supposed to go forwards in data science. Any advice would be seriously appreciated. ",28,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm a graduating physics major contemplating transitioning to data science as a career.  I have fairly relevant undergrad research experience (bioinformatics-type stuff), and I feel that I have a relatively strong CV for entrance into a CS program.  As such, I have applied to a few and am still waiting for admission letters.  I have already been accepted to a reputable data science program at a good university; what I'm concerned about is the lack of research grants for graduate students.  Ideally, I'd like to complete my masters with minimal debt, and it seems like CS programs have more available funding for grad students.  

Another consideration is the future of data science itself.  I'm more interested in the statistical analysis / business analytics side, but from everything I've read and everyone I've talked to, automation is a big consideration for the future of the field.  I've read that data science will likely move toward implementation rather than analytics as tools become more powerful and easier to use.  This would make a CS masters more attractive... But I'm slightly more interested in the material taught in DS masters programs.

I am measuring their both perceived and objective literacy. Perceived literacy is measured with 7-point scale. Regarding the objective knowledge, I made 7 multiple choice questions with one correct answer. So users may acquire from 0 to 7 points as an accumulated score for their objective literacy.

So I am planning to combine 7 multiple choice questions into one variable with accumulated score. (Ex. Respondent answered 4 out of 7 questions, as a result he/she is assigned 4points)

Then I'd merge objective and perceived literacy variables into one overall literacy ( ex. Respondent indicated 5 for perceived literacy and scored 4 points for objective literacy. So the mean value of newly created variable out of these two is 4,5)
However, I don't know how to put it on practice. Not sure whether Qualtrics has such features and for statistical analysis I am using IBM SPSS statistics.

Probably I could merge two variables with Confirmatory Factor analysis, however, I still have no idea how to transform the multiple choice questions with one correct answer.

I've been considering making a transition from my current background (psychology with a higher-than-average grasp of statistics) to data science. I've spoken to quite a few different professionals and have received varying advice. Most of them have  either worked with data scientists or are I.T professionals, but none of them were familiar with data science personally.

Specifically:

1. What's the training like? I'm eligible for a Masters at a good Australian university, but I don't even know if it's necessary.

2. Would I benefit from studying in my own time then just doing a PhD instead? I have minimal interest in academia after seeing what happens to the people that don't make it big.

3. What are some of the best institutions to study it if it's a good call? My grades are good and I'm very interested/motivated. I also don't have any financial constraints at all, so I can study in any country (I'm based in a country that has 0 decent universities).

If anyone has time or is willing to talk, I'd also love to either Skype sometime or talk via PMs. I've been travelling a lot lately to meet people and have realized I get way more out of actual conversations than trading messages online. Thanks in advance =)

I'm just two years out of school (Mechanical engineering and MBA) and pretty much wandered about since then. A lot of factors and forces are coming down on me right now and badly require a job. Long story short, 25 years after birth, I've realised I want to be one of two things, if not both: (1) Data scientist and (2) Product Manager. According to my plan, with either job, I'll be launching a part-time business. So I will be picking up Product Management skills there, so I've sorta made up my mind to enter the industry/field as a data scientist. Due to certain personal pressures, I want to convert the first interview I get!!

I got in touch with a CEO of a fast growing start-up who was willing to consider me as a special case and gave me an assignment to complete in 1.5 days. I took 2.25 days give it, but he's friendly enough to not mind that (atleast seems so). Anyways, guys, I'm not a charming guy who can talk his way into jobs (in fact I'm the opposite) - I need to work for it! and I want to too! Just need good guidance from good mentors!

Firstly, I just submitted the assignment (segregation task in python).. while I submitted SOMETHING, I am not at all confident, if the code is going to run on his machine as it did in mine (more worrisome because towards the end, it even stopped working on my machine- I simply submitted out of frustration!) He said He'll get back to me next week due to travel, work, etc.

I already plan to surprise him with some additional work that he didn't ask for- but really what i need is some confidence that my code will work and is appropriate for the task because I dont know what is right for what! I have good qualifications otherwise, he might actually be expecting me to sweep him off his feet. So, I think a review/followup etc within 24-48 hours would help the cause.

Apart from that, would love to be touch for advice, direction and problem-solving practice!

**Columbia Data Science**

**Pros:** 

* Ivy League University, hence the reputation
* New York City provides many opportunities for data science

**Cons:**

* Large class size (about 100 students)
* Does not provide placement statistics like mean/median starting salaries of students
* OPT Period of 17 months, which, I think, is very short for me to repay my loan
* Only two classes have graduated thus far as compared to Northwestern's four

**Northwestern Analytics**

**Pros:**

* Extremely impressive placement stats (with class of 2016 managing $105k median starting salary and 100% placement)
* Complete curriculum focussing on descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics
* Small class size (about 50 students)
* OPT Period of 29 months, which is a whole year longer than Columbia's

**Cons:**

* Set in Evanston, near Chicago, so I am not sure whether most students end up getting placed in Chicago or whether they get offers in New York or California, and whether Chicago is a good place for Data Science",3,0,False,self,,,,,

I need help regarding a project for my university as I am more or less new to data science and the tutorials Ive found werent really helpful.

I have a dataset of around 800,000 time stamps within an interval of 5 minutes from 2009 until 2015. Furthermore, I got information about the sales of a restaurant within these five minute frames, information about the weather, the number of potential customers and whether the restaurant was open or not. 

The task is to predict the number of sales for the time frames of 2016.

As I havent any experience with Python or R I tried SPSS Modeler. I know that I have to do a time series analysis and Ive watched some tutorials for the SPSS Modeler. When using the time frame model the program says that there is a limit of 100.000 rows. I got around 800.000 rows. Is there anything I can do about it or is SPSS Modeler just the wrong program to use? Furthermore, it seemed problematic that I want to use variables of different kind (e.g. Temperature: metric, Is the restuarant open: ordinal).

My sample consists of about 200 such addresses.

I engineered some features: word count, character count, comma-count (many of them dont have commas even though they have full addresses), pincode present, city present, manually checked resolvability, can Google maps parse it without the phrase needing to be modified.

I've figured out that all un-resolvable ones have wordcount &lt;2 and comma-count &lt;2, using simple exploratory analysis. So, if I ignore all data points in this category and simply run the rest of them through Google, then I'm getting a very good predictability rate i.e., I can standardise the address into components such as locality, street name, city, pincode over 99% (low type 1 error) of the time. However, this also means that I'm leaving behind many many data points that could benefit from running through Google i.e., out of the omitted ones, ~40% can be parsed into some structure i.e., I can get the city name or pin code or something else useful from google. But I do not want to run all of them through Google as a) thats expensive and b) it's more likely to give me a misleading result than a useful one.

So, I need to figure out a way to classify all my addresses into two buckets: 1) whether I can parse them (using Google) or 2) do I simply leave them be. As you know by now, my data-set consists of original address text and a few binary features (pincode present or not, etc) and a three whole number ones (wordcount, comma-count, character count). My to-be-predicted Resolvable feature is also going to be a 0 or 1. I'm open to creating more features if need be. I find this lack of continuous variables somewhat troubling.

I'm new to this and only know linear and logit regression. So I'm sure that both aren't useful to me here. What techniques are appropriate here to reduce my omission of good data points? I need some sort of non-linear classification but dont know which to use or how to approach.

I want to maximize additional sale revenue  from a limited marketing budget.  I don't want to waste money marketing to customers who would buy the product anyways.  

Let's use a basic hypothetical example:  

*  Product = McDonalds location
*  Many people go to McDonalds at various frequencies (some daily, some 1x per week, some 1x per month, some never)
*  If my goal was to increase the total *VISITS*  at this location by emailing/mailing ads/coupons/videos/etc I might use variables such as AGE, GENDER, DISTANCE, INCOME, DAYofWEEK to predict binary outcome.
*  That is fine, but how do I control for the fact that some of these people are going to go no matter what?  E.g my model might find that it can capture 60% chance if you will go to McDonalds tomorrow.   
*  Building upon the above bullet - I don't want to spend money mailing out promotions to people who will go to McDonalds no matter what. How, do I optimize between sending mail to someone who goes on average 1x per week vs 1x per month vs never?

Its easy for me to build a classification/probability model for the standard buy/non-buy, but how do I go a step further and target only the people where this 'marketing' would actually be incremental?

Product data (among others) contains variables: name, description, price, dimensions, color and the old label . The idea was to construct features out of the unstructured variables through tokenisation -&gt; TF-IDF.
Proposed Approach:

* Train one multi-label prediction model (e.g. Ridge classification + cross-validation + stratified CV) on the labeled data. Then predict the category only for subset that, based on the old product tree, contains all possible products. (e.g. predict if unlabelled 'Electronics' products are 'Alarm clocks')

* Based on the predicted probability present the unlabelled product to a content manager that, if labelled, would result in the highest information gain.
* Propose to which extend the remaining 400 categories should be filled (e.g. 60%) and which products to label first.

Hi everyone!  This past year, my company invested in a mobile app that allows us to sell our products (various collectibles) direct to consumer rather than through distributors.  With that, we've gained access to more data on consumer behavior and transactions, and a position was created to analyze and find insights from that data.  I expressed interest immediately since I wanted to learn more about data analysis and maybe pursue a career in data science. 

My only background is a few stats classes back in college and a beginner R course.   My managers know even less and have basically left everything up to me in terms of figuring out how to structure the position and what the needs are.  What can I do to prepare myself?  Aside from learning R and SQL, are there any other languages or software that can help me with my new role?  My director has mentioned that they are willing to pay for classes, are there any programs (certifications, nanodegrees, etc.) worth pursuing, especially if I want to work towards becoming a data scientist?  Do they have merit if I switch companies?

I had applied to a data scientist position at an online marketplace startup of about 10-15 employees. They are now looking to start data science and analytics operations in the company.    

This startup is like Amazon for certain exotic items in India.        

And so today, I got a call from them informing me I was selected for the role. Naturally, I'm happy, but here's the thing -  I will be their **first ever** data scientist, and I have only about 3 months of previous experience in data science from an internship at a different company.      

There is nobody in the company who can guide me, and I'm far from an expert in the field. I am a graduate of Industrial Engineering with some knowledge of statistics.           

Here is the list of what I already did/know because of the internship -        

* Data wrangling and cleaning (of mostly structured data) using dplyr and tidyr        
* Feature engineering (transformations, PCA, imputation of missing data etc.)          
* Deploying machine learning algorithms (random forests, xgboost, support vector machines, neural networks, cubist etc.)         

I used R for all of the above. I have extensively read *Applied Predictive Modeling* by Max Kuhn and *Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James et al. Both these books are my go-to reference manuals.      
____________
From the job description I was given, my new job will involve -    
      
* Generating insights from data (structured, unstructured and streaming data)        
* Building statistical models to improve company operations        

The data I'll be dealing with will mostly involve their inventory database and transactional data.  
_____________________________
Is there any advice from the more experienced data scientists here?   

What new things do I have to learn? What should I avoid doing? I want to succeed as a data scientist, or at least do a decent job in this new role. I'm rather anxious and I don't want to screw this up.

- Data Scientist at a big four (PWC, EY, KPMG, Deloitte):
This work would be in advisory and would therefore involve a large amount of consulting tasks. Technically the job title would be something like ""Data Analysis Consultant"", but it is still referred to as a data science position within the company. Lowest salary but great brand name.

- Data Scientist at a large mobile network operator. Highest salary and great team with some challenging tasks. Classical data scientist position within a team.

While the decision also depends on some factors that are not included here, I am wondering which job would prepare me best for a long and interesting data science career based on the different industries and responsibilities.

If I weren't in such a unique situation, I would've just Googled my question, but I'm hoping this is the right place to get some good advice. Here is my current situation. Four years ago, at 37 years old, and after working as a systems admin for 10 years, I decided to return to school to pursue a career in data science. 

I am now at Cornell, majoring in Information Science and will have 3 credits remaining to graduate after this semester ends. Cornell offers an MPS (Masters of Professional Studies) in Information Science. It is a 1-year degree, with a focus on preparing students for industry, as opposed to a typical 2-year research based MS. I can apply to an Early Admit program, which would allow me to take the Master's courses next fall semester while I finish my one remaining undergrad course. During that semester I would technically still be an undergrad, so I will still be getting a ton of financial aid (i.e. not paying much at all). Because the MPS is only a 1-year program, I would only have to pay for one semester's (next spring semester) worth of tuition and living expenses (~30k total). Here is my dilemma. At 41 years old, is it worth it to take on the extra 30k in loans just to get an extra semester of schooling and the MPS degree? Here are my thoughts for and against.

PROS: The data science market is hot right now, and having any sort of graduate degree to separate myself from the rest is beneficial. The possibility of working on a data analytics project with the students from the MBA school would give me valuable exposure to the business side of things, which seems to be very important from what I have read. 

CONS: With an additional 30k in loans I would be doubling my current loan balance for one additional semester of school. I'm not sure how the MPS degree is regarded from an industry perspective. Because of this, I'm not sure if getting this additional degree and taking on the extra debt is going to start me off at a much better salary than I could attain after just graduating next fall semester with the BS.

In my own experience, I know that experience on the job, 40 hrs/wk is how you actually learn things, and part of me really just thinks I should get out there asap, but I'm worried that by not getting a graduate degree I may be limiting myself in the long run. So, any opinions out there from those either in the field, or those who do the hiring? Thanks in advance, and sorry for being so long-winded.",21,8,False,self,,,,,

However, when one of the interviewers asked me yesterday if I had ever tested any of these models, I did not really have an answer. I was always focused on r-squared values for model fit as oftentimes I did not have other data available to test out the results other than what I used to create the model.

My name is Matthew Enthoven and I'm one of the cofounders of http://opencritic.com

I'm working on a feature where we display the standard deviation of a video game's review scores. OpenCritic already displays the average review score, along with information and branding conveying how that average stands in a broader view of the industry.

One thing I'm struggling with is how to make the standard deviation more approachable.

My goal is to tag each game with at least N reviews with one of the following statements:

 - ""Critics agree about this game more than usual.""
 - ""Critics disagree about this game at a normal amount.""
 - ""Critics disagree about this game more than usual.""

The two issues I'm running into conceptually are...

 - 1. Standard deviations, in general, consolidate as the number of reviews increases. Major titles get dozens of reviews, while smaller games will often only get a handful to ~20. Major titles also have higher budgets and more expertise, making their review scores more predictable.
 - 2. Standard deviations shrink as the score gets higher because there's a ceiling of 100.

So I work in the food service industry for a relatively small company. I was brought on as a business analyst, which was a title we came up with because the position was totally new, and it was just kind of a place holder. Now that I've had some time doing the job, I'm going to have my first review and the title is going to come up. Basically, I want something a little more true to what is is that I actually do, which I'll list below:

-pull reports and analyze sales and product mix data 

-design/monitor/analyze marketing test methodology and report results and make recommendations to marketing directors

- design/monitor analyze tests for labor efficacy; things like the effects of minimum wage increases across the company, the effects of automation on jobs and our bottom line

-develop mapping tools to identify our areas of concentration and how best to allocate management resources to those areas

-development of internal tools (such as spreadsheets) to aid other departments with their processes. An example would be either building macros in VBA that automate their tasks, or building a tool for them to use for financial modeling and evaluation of leases, etc.

-Unrelated to those things I also built a real estate modeling tool which pulls a lot of data from census and other sources to come up with recommendations on up and coming areas which are prime for investment. 

There's probably more I'm missing, but that's the basic idea. Additionally I really only deal with Director level and up; I meet fairly frequently with the CEO to discuss initiatives or present findings to her. I don't think I can ask (well I did, but I think because its so new and there's a few pieces that need to fall in to place first) for a director's title. I want to accurately have a job title that is more ""data-science-y"" (this is because if I ever go to leave, which I don't want to, I'll have an easier time slipping in to some of these other roles) but I hesitate to say I'm a data scientist. I use Python, but I'm maybe at an intermediate level. For this job I haven't pulled a SQL querey, and I don't know that I will ever have to (in the foreseeable future). I also ocassionally employ GRETL. And Tableau to present findings sometimes.I do use a lot of quantitative methods, so I certainly have skill that way (my last job was economics related and I'm comfortable with math). 

I would appreciate any and all feedback, thanks guys.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

I have a data set of movies watched by users. For some of the users, we know that they watched the movie, and what their rating is for that movie. For many others we know they watched the movie, but don't know their rating of that movie.

I am looking to find a way to apply a predicted or perhaps interpolated rating to those users movies they watched based on the larger dataset that has movies ratings. I am trying to find out what the best course of action around this would be. I have 1.5m users and 20K movies; however only 10% of those movies are rated by about 85% of users.

My approach is thus looking at cosine similarity and interpolating the rating based on the neighbor; and if the nearest neighbor doesnt have a value for a specific movie, go to the next nearest until all the movies have a rating. The other approach is looking at NNMF to apply ratings, and having 2*features-- one binary representation of the movies, the other the rating. So when I look to ""predict"" for a user, Ill input their binary movie values and it will return their ratings.

My questions are: Does the NNMF approach make sense? I have never used NNMF in that way. Also, are there any other models you think make sense? I am wondering if their is more of a prediction algorithm that can be employed rather than an interpolation-- I was told once that Neural Nets might help with predicting this, but I dont see how with 20K features that any prediction model can handle this.",10,6,False,self,,,,,

There are way to many options out there that I don't know which route to take. I am currently majoring in Computer Science, and want to go into Data Analysis. I have taken one statistics course at my college, but don't have the options to continue on with that in school.

Right now, I am signed up for [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), which I definitely want to finish. But it seems like it teaches you more about the tools of data science and less about the thought process and other techniques.

There's like an infinite amount of resources out there, and I'm confused about which one to pursue. For example:

* [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/)
* Foundations of Data Analysis edX [Part 1](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-data-analysis-part-1-utaustinx-ut-7-11x) [Part 2](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-data-analysis-part-2-utaustinx-ut-7-21x)
* The Analysts Edge [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-2)
* Statistics with R Specialization [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)
* Machine Learning by Andrew Ng [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

And so many more.

I graduate in May of 2018, so I'm trying to be marketable by December to give me a chance to find an actual full time job by next summer. I'm excited about Data Science and Machine Learning, so motivation is not an issue.

Does anybody have any suggestions on which of these I should pursue, or other options? I like the dataquest.io route because it's hands on, but it's also pricey. I also figure I should learn something with R since I have experience with Python under my belt already.

My thoughts are to take a statistics course to complement the bootcamp I'm taking.

Got a tough decision to make. I would call this a 'good problem' as I am sure I will enjoy it however it turns out. But I want to know what is actually important to me and I'm hoping you can share your unique opinions.

I've chosen to pursue a master's in Data Science and I have been accepted into a couple of schools so far. (UIUC in the US and Maastricht University in the Netherlands). The variables that I think should influence my decision (in no order) are:

* ROI - Netherlands is way cheaper than the US when it comes to tuition (like, half). But my chances of earning a good salary in the US are significantly more. *What does a graduate student earn right out of college in the NL?* 
* Job Prospects - I want to work in the same country for sometime once I graduate.  *How do you think the Netherlands compares to the US in terms of range and quantity of jobs?*

* Course Content - Maastricht provides better electives and also has a unique pedagogical method called Project Based Learning. Continuously working on group projects and presenting them will benefit me in the long term, I feel.

* Life outside work - The US is also notorious for long working hours and little paid vacation. *Mostly true?*

* Community - Europe has a language barrier. I have no qualms learning a language, but I hear not being a local (I'm from India) makes it insanely hard to grow professionally (promotions etc) in Europe. *Is this true?*

I have tried to focus my coursework on classes that emphasized quantitative analysis. I have worked hard in school and maintained a 3.8 GPA. I have a research assistant job, work at a restaurant, and I am in the national guard.

My future career goals are to become a ""data scientist."" What I mean by this is that I want to get proficient at every step of the data analysis process from data mining and warehousing to statistical analysis and communicating the results. I have a decent background in statistical theory and some econometrics with SAS.

I have been offered two jobs this past week and I have been given a deadline of Tuesday to decide. I am from, and have family/friends in, Richmond Va.

Job 1: Think tank in D.C. where I would be an analyst in a new division called ""advanced data analytics."" I would focus primarily on health related projects, but the technical side of these. 80% of the employees here have graduate degrees. 60% have PHD's. The culture is fairly traditional and emphasizes formal education. My interview lasted only 1 hour and 15 minutes, and I met with 4 people. The people were very laid back, and I felt like I led the direction of the interview. They mentioned some projects utilizing machine learning, however we didn't go into details about it. This makes me think that the projects here would be more sophisticated, but that's just speculation.

2nd Job: Small auto insurance place in Richmond, Va. I would start out in the MIS (management information systems) where I would be using SQL to manage databases. I would do this until I got out of the national guard (2 years) then I would be sent to the UK for a year where I would train to become a pricing analyst. I would come back to Richmond as a pricing analyst and be responsible for conducting statistical analysis (SAS and R) to improve the efficiency of their pricing strategy.

Pay: In nominal terms the pay is almost the same, however the cost of living in D.C. is considerably higher.

I am in desperate need of advice. Any insights you could offer would be greatly appreciated.

edit: One of my concerns is not being able to participate in the more sophisticated work that the think tank is doing because the majority of analysts there have graduate degrees. I want to focus on developing skills, but if I'm stuck doing mundane busy work, then I don't know if it will be very valuable to me. A big plus of the D.C. job is that they have a decent tuition reimbursement program.

&gt; At its heart, the analysis is based on commenter overlap: Two subreddits are deemed more similar if many commenters have posted often to both. This also makes it possible to do what we call subreddit algebra: adding one subreddit to another and seeing if the result resembles some third subreddit, or subtracting out a component of one subreddits character and seeing whats left. 

They give an example: the subreddit most similar to /r/the_donald, if you take out /r/politics commenters, is /r/fatpeoplehate.

The authors have [posted their R code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/subreddit-algebra) and using that I've recreated their list of subreddit pairs. Here's an extract (full set is 15 million rows):

About me: I am a Physics UK Msci graduate looking to start a career in data-science. I am currently in the UK but do not have UK citizenship, I do however have French-American citizenship. I currently have both job and PhD offers in the UK and am unsure which would be best to start a data science career. My choices are
Choice 1:
Career as a researcher in data and analytics for a major British networking company. The salary while competitive is on the lower side (30K pounds for the people who know the UK salary range).
Choice 2: 
4 year paid UK PhD with integrated master in data-driven science. The PhD project would involve building a Bayesian inference engine for a a small subfield of Physics where statistics have not traditionally been applied. I get along very well with the supervisor but she is an expert in the scientific field and not in statistics.
Choice 3:
4 year paid UK PhD in computer vision using deep learning with integrated masters. I will have a large amount of freedom in choosing my project. The supervisor is an expert in the field with multiple papers over 1000 citations.
Summary: I need too chose whether to go directly into the industry or undertake a PhD. If I do choose the PhD I also need to choose the field.

I'm looking for advice or a recommendation on a method that I could use to model the failure rate of a product.  I thought datascience might be able help after I listened to an episode of Data Skeptic called the [""Library Problem""](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2016/the-library-problem) that seemed similar to an problem and dataset i'm dealing with@  

The dataset I have consists of 2 parts: 

* The individual failure events of particular (with properties)
* The summary of the total number of units (by property)

I have posted a snapshot of some hypothetical data in the same format here as it is easier to read than a reddit-formatted table:
http://imgur.com/a/8Yu8G
My actual dataset consists of hundreds of failures and a much larger breakdown of exposure but this is the basic format.

Both datasets are recorded across a consistent time period.  It seems that this would be a much simpler problem if I considered the variables (Size, Strength, Age) to be independent, however it is known from experience that the variables are not independent.  For example, units of a particular strength and age are known to be highly susceptible to failure.

Can someone point me to, or recommend a method to look into for processing or analysing a dataset in this form?

I'm cross posting this from cscareer since I was hoping for more advice than just 'make flappy birds, and since I'm really interested in data analysis. I hope I don't bother you guys too much. 

I would really like to try and get well on my way to a job in about 6 months. I know the timeline is tight, but to be frank my full time job is already starting lay-offs. If I could at least start to monetize at that point, it would be awesome.

I've been messing around programming for quite some time- mostly Python and a smidgen of R and I would describe myself as low intermediate perhaps. I work full time, so the projects tend to come in spurts on the weekends. 

Now that I'm seriously looking at making a go of this, I'm rather lost. I know I need to tart up my github, and I have a domain that I can make into a portfolio. Should I aim at increasing my project count? What's the easiest way to begin to monetize? I know that most freelancer sites are extremely hard to make decent money. 

So far I've completed a variety of courses on Udemy, Edx, and Coursera. I mostly enjoy data wrangling so I've done things like Kaggle's Titanic project, Rosalind, and other small bits and bobs (FizzBuzz!), and I was involved with a project that extracted data from.one database, applied tool and analysis and then added it to another. Really I've just been messing around.

So, my ""data pipeline"" typically involves an extra step of digitizing data.

My usual process for digitizing data is as follows:

1. Create detailed instructions to transcribe my data.
2. Hire two data entry firms and provide instructions.
3. Write Python script which checks differences between two CSV files (I only do this once).
4. Run script on two firms' transcription, and manually correct the differences between the CSV files.

Several things could be improved with this workflow:

* I would like to be able to directly write to a SQLite database.
* I would like to be able to enforce constraints on what can possibly be transcribed entered into a field. For example, it would be useful to enforce a constraint that dates are properly formatted.
* In some situations, I might want a simple GUI interface in which the data transcriber can see just the image to transcribe and some fields in which to enter the data.
* My script to compare the two CSV files requires the data to be entered in an exact order. If, for example, one of the data entry firms accidentally deleted a row, the error checking script would detect differences between every following row.

It looks like there are many different data entry software which might provide something like this functionality, and it's unclear whether any of them are best, or whether they provide my exact desired functionality. Additionally, most of the software are proprietary, whereas I'd ideally use FOSS.

Do you have any suggestions of desktop software, or maybe some sort of web application which would be useful for my type of data entry needs? I'm a passable Python programmer, so if it turns out there are no such options, I may end up making my own software.

I am trying to use WEKA for identification and classification of documents based on author using Naive Bayes. I have a dataset of stories written by sci-fi authors such as Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick and Ray Bradbury .


&amp;nbsp;



I have converted these documents into arff file using the following scheme: 


*@relation Authors*


*@attribute textOfStory string*  
*@attribute authorOfStory {""Isaac"",""Philip"",""Ray""}*

(In training and test data - using two or more novels/short stories in each set for every author)


&amp;nbsp;


Afterwards, I converted the textOfStory to attributes using String to Word Vector (IDF transform + TF transform = true). This resulted in unigram word vectors with certain frequencies. For eg. the word attribute ""screen"" was given value of 0.44544, 0.44544, 0 for the three authors.


&amp;nbsp;



Can anyone help me understand how these frequencies are being calculated? As I have read word unigram frequencies should be helpful in identifying and attributing the author. Am I going on the right path, is this the right way to proceed through this problem? How can I compare both the data set using Naive Bayes in an interpretable manner? Any help is appreciated.

I have a bunch of patent numbers (around 5000 unique patent numbers) from the 1970s to 2017, but do not have the inventors. I want to have the inventors' names associated with the patent number. 

I know this information is readily available online as it is all in the public domain, but I am having trouble getting access to it without doing it manually. Google patents and the [USPTO](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm) would both allow me to look this stuff up manually pretty easily, but it would take a lot of time (plus the dataset might grow in the near future, meaning even more time). 

I have had a lecture on webscraping, which might be an option, but as I understand from reading the robots.txt page, neither website allows me to automate the gathering of information.

The USPTO also has a website for [bulk downloads](https://developer.uspto.gov/data). I have been trying to see if there is something here which I can use, but the files are huge (~100 GB once they are unzipped). The big problem here is that I am downloading a lot of information that is useless to me (like the full text of the patent). I do not have any experience working with these large sets of information, and I do not know the best tools to extract and manipulate this information as it crashes excel and I am not entirely sure how the data is structured. 

There is also an [API organized by the USPTO](https://developer.uspto.gov/api-catalog). I have zero experience with API's, and I have been trying to input a list of patent number instead of doing it one by one, but I have not had any luck so far. 

I have medium experience with excel, Visual basic and matlab. I am just learning R and Python.

I've worked for: a consultancy that uses telco data, including customer information and trajectories derived in-house from raw tower data; the local urban planning authority, and the city's public health board. There has been so much variation in the process used to analyse data, and I'm not trained in quantitative research, which leads me to this post. 

I was at the consultancy in sophomore year, and besides generic data engineering and database work, the main deliverable I had to show for my time was just a bunch of dashboards to slice and dice the processed data in a bunch of ways that we thought would meet the clients' needs. This company had the most data scientists (statisticians, quantitative researchers, and computer engineers experienced in machine learning) of any place I've worked at to date, but consequently I was really far removed from any of that kind of work. I mean, I did try to engage them, and they were pretty willing to try to explain their methodology to me given the hectic circumstances, but it felt like things were happening at too high a level for me to pick up on exactly why they were using the methods they were to process the data. 

At the urban planning authority, there was almost no work going on that was explicitly called data science, but I had the sense that there was some statistical work going on in a traditional research environment, like you might expect from political science or geography graduates. Unfortunately I was pretty removed from that too, and I was tasked to spend most of my time trying to coax data sets out from operational systems like databases used to publish travel times or car park availability on public road signs. There was a lot of bureaucracy, but also a lot of random exploration in stuff like VR, drones and aircraft, 3D modelling, voice-to-text interfaces for in-house GIS applications... I was super lost and isolated trying to apply the whole cycle of data exploration, question formation, model selection etc to data I could get hold of, and despite them asking me to do it since I proposed as much at the interview, there didn't seem to be much interest in what I did. Granted, the data sets I did get hold of weren't even very consequential ones by my own opinion. 

Finally, at the public health board where I'm ending my stint next week, I've been most successful in applying machine learning to get insights that they seem to receive well, but I don't feel like I'm doing real research. I've been working with stuff like wearable sensor data from participants in some public health programs, and not only do the models I know how to use seem inadequate or even inappropriate, despite seeming to produce meaningful insights... I'm not really following any proper research methodology. I know what to expect in terms of deliverables if we're talking about research papers, I read enough research to find out more about what kind of work is already going on, but it feels like there should be some kind of proper methodology to it, if I'm going to make bold claims about the data, e.g. predictions or profiling. 

I've been asked to continue on at the public health board, but I really doubt the work I've been doing. It's not a simple matter of lack of confidence in the machine learning models I decided to use, that's up to me to read more, study properly when to use what, and why. But I want to be able to improve from the position of doing analysis, using self-verified methodology. How do you have confidence in the results you achieve?

The problem is that my training examples come from a supposedly well-curated public database, but many of the labels are not correct. In some cases a genome is labeled species A when it should clearly be species B, but in other cases the concept of ""species A"" just doesn't match the natural clustering because these things were originally defined way before this genomic data was even available.

I'm stuck with this weird problem that's halfway between a supervised and unsupervised problem, where I want labels that match the ""natural"" clustering of the data while still being as close to the original ones as possible. If I could just drop 10% or so of my 70k genomes to achieve this that would be great, but I'm really struggling with figuring out how to go about that.

I'm not even quite sure what metric to evaluate how good my labeling/clustering is. The ideal is for each training example/genome the furthest genome in the same species is still closer than the closest of a different species, but I'm not sure this is possible.

Is there any way I can extract the bounding box of the fish near the middle?  ",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I am a Stats and Computational Modeling Double major at VT. I do very well in all of my Stats classes and get C+s to As in my programming classes (I excel in my R and Python classes but struggle with C and Java). But anyways, I am pretty much bombing Discrete right now, and I just wanted to know if this would hurt me in the field. Or should I just keep trying to survive it so I can take the last two classes for my CS Minor (Intro to Computer Organization and Data Structures and Algorithms)?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Ax + b = y

But couldn't this formula be simplified if you consider x as [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates) and A as a homogeneous transformation? As in, just append a constant onto x. Then your equation becomes just:

Ax = y

I've got an interesting idea for a project in my Linguistics course, but I need to collect data about what words are frequently used in highly-upvoted and highly-downvoted posts/comments in selected subreddits. I want to explore the effect of word complexity on vote patterns in different subreddits.

Is there an easy way to collect this sort of data? 

I'm a CS major, so I'm very comfortable installing and learning how to use new software for data collection and analysis. However, I am somewhat time constrained due to project deadlines and other work, so I don't have a ton of free time to do a LOT of programming - if there's a pre-existing solution to collect sets of words that are found in highly-upvoted/highly-downvoted posts, organized by subreddit, that'd be ideal. If not, what tools can I use to do this kind of data collection and analysis?",7,2,False,self,,,,,
