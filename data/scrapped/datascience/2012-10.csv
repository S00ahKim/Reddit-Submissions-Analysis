As a fresh data scientist, what can I expect to make annually?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11vp77/data_scientists_help_me_out_as_a_fresh_data/,omlettehead,1350879392,"I do not know if this is the right subreddit to post, but here goes anyways. 

Data science has been my primary interest for a long while now, and I have just graduated with a Masters in Machine learning &amp; Data mining, before which I pursued a bachelors in Software engineering, both with excellent grades and from good schools. I am in the final stages of interviews for my dream job of a data scientist, at a good small-but-popular company. Everything has been good for me, so far.

My problem is, I have no idea what to answer when they ask the inevitable question on what I expect to make. I really don't know what kind of compensation I should be asking for. There just isn't enough information on the internet, given that this is such a new profession. I have very little ""real world"" experience, except for several software engineering internships, totaling to about a year's worth, and several projects, both academic and personal. This would be my first ""real"" job. Should I expect just as much as a software developer/engineer? What other professional salaries are comparable to an entry level data-scientist?  Any kind of information would be helpful. Thanks!",4,5,False,self,,,,,
