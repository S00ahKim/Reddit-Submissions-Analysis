I am looking to make a Logistic Regression Model in python (R is taking just too much time).

Can you guys point me to a good tutorial? Not the sklearn one, but something for non developers. ",0,1

Description : Collates hard business, finance and economics articles.

How can the simple ordered list of articles be best displayed to convey as much information in a glance as to their contents?

I am open to your ideas, suggestions, thoughts or vague intuitions.

Some possible tools that can be implemented in css
* Link Flairs 
* User flairs - use designated approved submitters maybe? 
* Searching by flairs
* Collapsing menus
* Header image - can it convey information?
* Sticky notes
* Different coloured article titles 
* Word clouds

I can use functions like kmeans in R to identify clusters in the datasets I'm working with, but I'd like to learn more about the specifics of the algorithms involved.

It can also mean the difference between I Feel Productive and Everything I try takes so much time.

When deciding which toolkit / stack be sure to learn from others, consider implementation partners, and always remain cautious. 

I am surveying people to determine which data science technology stacks are being used right now. The survey responses will remain confidential and can be accessed via this link: http://bit.ly/ToolkitSurvey (takes less than 200 seconds!).

Those that complete the survey will get a copy of a report (which will detail the pros/cons of popular data science technology stacks).
