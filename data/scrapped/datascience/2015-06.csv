Over the last year or so I've decided I really wanted to get into the field of data science, and have been taking courses on datacamp/coursera to prepare, but it really seems the only way I will be able to transition without taking a huge paycut would be to get my MS.


I am looking at all online programs so that I can continue working while I finish the degree.  I am just trying to figure out what degree would be the best, since there are so many options ranging from statistics, analytics, data science, etc.  I am also looking to keep the cost somewhere around 30 - 35k.


One degree I have been looking into is the [Philadelphia University MS in Modeling, Simulation, and Data Analytics](http://www.philau.edu/msda/curriculum.html), however I was hoping someone with more experience in the data science field would be able to give me some info on if it seems like a good program or not.

Some other programs I am currently considering:

* [Penn State MS in Applied Statistics]( http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/applied-statistics-masters/faq)
* [Villanova MS in Analytics](http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/business/graduate/specializedprograms/msa/curriculum.html)
* [Boston University MS in Computer Information Systems concentration in Data Analytics](http://www.bu.edu/met/programs/graduate/computer-information-systems/data-analytics/)
* [Elmhurst MS in Data Science](http://www.elmhurst.edu/data_science/227876081.html)
* [Lewis University MS in Data Science](http://online.lewisu.edu/msds/masters-in-data-science/courses?cmgfrm=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl)
* [Loyola MS in Applied Statistics](http://www.luc.edu/math/msappliedstat.shtml#faq-261294Collapse)
* [USC MS in Data Science](http://www.cs.usc.edu/academics/masters/msdata.htm)

There are so many options that it gets overwhelming deciding which degree would be the right choice, so I was hoping somebody more experienced could shed some light on it for me.  I know most people suggest schools like Columbia, NC State, Northwestern, etc., but I really cannot afford to spend 50-60k on a degree at the moment.

I'm an aspiring data science in the summer of my first year of college. I haven't learned much data analysis nor science over the past year so I haven't qualified for a data science internship...yet.

That said, I've gotten an IT internship within the education sector. I'm lucky enough to be paired with a more coding-esque mentor, so I'm not really assigned to open boxes or re-image computers for deployment. My mentor works with web development, which means designing/creating/maintaining the asset management website and other internal websites used for IT's benefit.

I'm open to learning the technologies for this internship for personal growth (including HTML/CSS and the Ruby on Rails framework), but is there anything I can do/propose in order to develop more in the data science direction? **(i.e.: If you were at a web development internship, what would/could you do in order to make yourself more attractive to a future data science role?)**

I was thinking data visualization might be useful to understand, but I would appreciate any and all insights. Thanks!",3,3

I need some opinions. Hopefully from those of you who've been in similar situations. 

Educational Background: CS Grad, Masters in Statistics (computational Bayes flavour: hidden markov, MCMC using R, C++)

I started a graduate role in at an Insurance/Banking giant about 4 months ago. When my employer was courting me, they said all the right things in terms of a role for me in team building predictive models using customer behaviour, big data etc. The reality has been somewhat disappointing. The main focus of my role is ""campaign reporting"" read: Writing and maintaining SQL to pull data about various direct marketing campaigns into Excel dashboards. A lot of this is manual shuffling data around between applications. I've used my coding chops to speed up the reports and automate a lot the junk work, and while this was won me kudos, I'm reticent to become ""The reporting automation guy"". I've taken my concerns to my leader, who has said he understands my frustration and that our group is moving to a place where my skills will be in high demand, I just have to be patient.

A couple of days ago my research supervisor from my university offered my a full-time research assistant role on one of her big data projects. It's a very interesting project and has a commercial partner (agricultural) which for me is a plus. The catch is the role is a ""fixed 1 year term with opportunity for extension"" kind of deal. 

I'm currently leaning toward the RA role. It plays better, ~10k,  but I gather that people in these roles often work a lot of overtime, so the pay is probably even in real terms. The motivator for me to take the RA job to avoid letting these hard won skills atrophy while my current employer plays catch up. On the other hand, my current role feels like it has more certainty and higher earning capacity if I could stick it out for a few years.

Who's been in this position before? What did you do, and how did it work out? Give me some data people! :)

My guess is that degree in Financial Engineering would allow you to get Data Science jobs but not vise versa as it seems more prestige. For example for Berkeley, the Masters is through School of Information, while Financial Engienering is well Engineering. Let me know what your thoughts are. And those who are wondering why I am comparing is because I would like to get into the financial sector as a Data Scientist or Financial Engineer of some sort.

My team is responsible for providing the quantitative insights in our research projects, which are sold and presented to our clients. This involves analysis of mostly survey data of business managers and executives, with other firm-level data in the mix as well. We build and test quant models using traditional techniques- mostly using techniques like regression analysis, factor analysis, etc.

I'm also the most technical Analyst on my team. Even though my coworker has an MS in stats and my manager has a PHD in a quant field, I know far more programming and data science concepts than them. As you can extrapolate from that, our company/business unit is *far* from technical. 

My business unit is making a brand new team to, essentially, build data products (data visualization tools, etc.) and they want me to join the team since they know they need a person with technical skills on that new team. The tradeoff is it will take me away from the research I mentioned above, which I feel like is great experience for developing my skills in data science. 

I have a Bachelor's in Econ with a concentration in econometrics and in the future hope to pursue in MS in stats and break into a true data scientist role. 

I feel like keeping my focus on research experience will be best for that route, but the higher ups are pushing me to join the new team and are saying that having a leadership role in a new team developing data products will be best for my career. The thing is, I would be the only technical person on that team and have doubts about exactly how much innovation we would be able to achieve.

So I guess my question boils down to, as an aspiring data scientist am I better off in the trenches doing data analysis, or am I underestimating the benefits of getting management experience and developing data products in a company that is way behind in this area? I'm only a year out of college, so joining this new team could be a 'cool story', but what I really want is the experience to best develop the skills that will allow me to enter the field, and to that end I'm cautious to abandon my focus on having a quant role in our research projects.

I'm leaning towards staying in the research role as opposed to the product development role, but I see pros on both sides. I was wondering if anybody has any input on which direction would be better skill development for my career.

TLDR: Currently in a research role, management wants me to go to a product development role since I'm the only technical person in the business unit. I have doubts that the new role is best for my data science career and have doubts about the capabilities of the new team to succeed.

PhD at university 

- if computer science then good money, less than in indutry but not that much
- may be too theoretical
- takes up to five years

industry PhD 
 
- less money
- really interesting job description, at least on of them, for the other I still have the interview 
- not assured that I can actually finnish my PhD in the three years, then the contract runs out, still high probability to then work for the company (BMW or siemens) in a PhD position

Industry:

- most money
- two jobs I appplied to also seemed very interesting and exactly what I want to do (data science)
- maybe harder for career later when I have no PhD?

Sadly, we don't have any statisticians either.

I have run some tests with [asaini's implementation](https://github.com/asaini/Apriori) and some custom data and results are difficult to achieve depending on dataset size and parameters.

It is clear that knowing how to customise these parameters is what separates the wheat from the chaff of data scientists.

Also, everything I read about data science recently revolves around programming in Python or R, I was surprised to see Scala. How prevalent is Scala in the industry?

My question to practicing Statisticians, Machine Learning experts, and Data Scientists of Reddit is - how do you manage expectations from the businesspeople in you company, particularly with regards to predictive accuracy of models? To put it trivially, if your best model can only achieve 90% accuracy, and upper management expects nothing less than 99%, how do you handle situations like these?

I don't have a PhD!"" I know where you're coming from, but for many of you, just getting the factual answers to your questions will not help you become a data scientist. Why? Because your ""inner game"" is inhibiting you from reaching your goals.

What do I mean by ""inner game?"" As explained in the famous book *The Inner Game of Tennis*, the inner game is the game that goes on inside your head while you're playing a match. Most great players have a great inner game. When they lose a point, they don't dwell on it. When they are about to play a match against Roger Federer, they really *believe* that they can win. And even if they *do* win, they can still find things they could have improved in their play.

When I started my journey to become a data scientist, I was wracked with anxiety. I didn't really know anything about machine learning. Hell, I could barely program a computer. I tried to audit a Java programming class and left after a week. My inner game was weak, and I was stuck. I found some inspiration in the book [The Now Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination/dp/1585425524). The book helped me realize that my anxiety wouldnt go away through browsing the internet. So I stopped sitting at my computer and took action!

I had a huge breakthrough when I started going to data science meetups and actually talking to people. Contrary to the picture of data scientists I had gotten from the internet, I found out that most data scientists are not experts in everything. I found out that with some persistence, I *could* learn how to code and train machine learning algorithms. My anxiety fell away like magic, and my inner game got so much better. I no longer gave up when I had some trouble with my code. I felt much more confident reaching out to employers.  Soon after, I found my first data science  internship (at a Meetup!), which turned into a full-time job.

So whats my advice for the aspiring data scientists out there? Make sure your inner game is just as strong as your technical skills and your resume. Youll need confidence and persistence and resilience if you want to become a data scientist. And you will need all of those traits when you finally *get* your first data scientist job, too. Best of luck, and please feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

I just finished my first year of a PhD and I've been thinking about ways to earn a little bit of extra money on the side. I'm in a Cognitive Science PhD program and I have a BA in Linguistics and a BS in Cognitive Neuroscience. I've taken very few formal computer science or statistics classes, but I have tons of experience with programming &amp; data analysis because I'm in a very quantitative field. My programming skills are kind of hacky, but I've heard that might be desirable since most of data science is hacking ugly data into a better format (which I am great at!).

I've tried some searching but haven't had much luck myself. Can someone point me in the right direction of how to approach this? Are any special considerations needed?

If yes why, if no why and what could be a good option(I don't want to go on a MacBook pro, I think those computing are too flashy for my style and geospatial community look more active on windows machine)  

I want to run Qgis, Some python, PostGIS database, google earth and some R.  Some time my desktop machine(CPU i3-4130  @ 3.4 GHz; 8 Go RAM; System window 7-64 bits) freeze with Qgis. 

At the same time, I am thinking to start working with a server to run my script. What could by the best combo laptop and server to become a freelancer as a data analyst on Odesk?

I know it is a complex question, I am more looking to found people to discuss data analysis remotely that a perfect answer.

I'm fairly new to the data science world, but it seems that my question might relate to many others. I'd say I'm intermediate-advanced in my capabilities with R and it seems that the next logical step would be to pick up Python. However, doing beginner Python tutorials are generally repetitive to what I already know from R (for loops, conditionals, etc.), and jumping right into reading Python scripts is too confusing. Do you guys have any tips on trying to pick up Python (and maybe DS-style modules like SciKit-Learn, specifically) for someone with experience in R?

I am 24 years old and just graduated with an MS in Bioinformatics and an MS in Oncology.  Throughout my studies, I have taken 4 Python heavy courses in bioinformatics and I have used R extensively for my Masters thesis project.  I really want to get into Data Science and have been taking some Coursera courses over the past year from the Specialization Signature Track, as well as reading some books and watching lectures from UW Intro to Data Science.  

I certainly recognize the power of data science in biology, and strongly believe that many of these questions, algorithms, tools we use in bioinformatics can be applied to any discipline.  

My question to guys is:  do you think pursuing a PhD in pharmacology would give me a more competitive edge in the future when applying to DS jobs?  

I have been offered a fully-funded position at my university where I can transfer in 36 credit hours towards my PhD, as well as obtain a certificate in biostatistics (5 graduate level biostats courses) along the way.  And a previous student who basically followed the same course as I may be (although his interests are not necessarily the same) finished the program in just under 4 years.  

In addition to the pharmacology PhD and advanced biostats certificate, conditional upon working in the right lab (there are limited numbers with computational emphasis), I will be able to write and implement data mining and machine learning algorithms in my project.  I will gain the important critical/analytical thinking skills, improve my public speaking presentation and writing abilities, and acquire expertise in an emerging field.  I believe that I will be able to create a high quality portfolio throughout the 4 years that will give me a competitive edge in the job market.  I'm not exactly sure if thats true though -- so please let me know if I'm wrong.  

While I am naturally a motivated person, it is worth noting that I'm in $100k of student debt after undergrad and graduate school, so I need to achieve a certain level of expertise in order to tackle the debt when I enter the workforce.  Why did I get into this student debt?  Well, I come from a very very poor family and needed to fund my education, as well as pursue my interests, however, it turns out my original interests do not have high paying jobs, so I am trying to transition into something new and exciting that complements my current interests and while concurrently being lucrative.

TLDR; Would getting a PhD in pharmacology + Advanced Biostatistics Certificate improve my chances of getting a competitive, lucrative, data science job?  

Thanks guys.

I'm the first stats guy (as an intern) at a start up and I'm trying to help them answer a few questions about industry standards as they grow their analytics branch. One of these questions is how should the analytics team access data?. Currently, the majority of their information is accessed through a cli tool that they built which in turn pulls data from some DB. It can either return a complicated json blob or convert it to a csv then return it. Non stats people are making decisions about how to build the csv and often a lot of work needs to be spent on fixing these errors. The process is complicated b/c this is how our customer's want it. Now that the company is making a push for stats they are trying to figure out a better framework. I'm assuming most of you have access to some type of DB but I don't understand the differences or pros/cons of the various types. If you could add what tools you use to access your data, some info about your company and the type of work you do I would appreciate it. I think this would also be helpful for those of us still in school or just starting our careers.

&amp;nbsp;

Im posting yet another How to get started as a data scientist threads. Im sorry about that as Im sure theyre frequent around here. I dont know where else to turn to get a variety of input from people in the field. And right now, I admit I feel like my personal situation warrants an individual post. I hope for your advice. Im posting from a throwaway account because I dont want this post on my regular Reddit account which could identify me personally.

&amp;nbsp;

Backstory/Pertinent details: Im in my late 30s. I have a PhD in a social science. For the last 9 years, I have been an Assistant Professor in 2 different departments (one is a top 25 school in the US, the other is a moderately well recognized university in Western Europe). I am now currently in the US in a temporary academic job. I have rapidly lost my faith in employment in academia due to a number of factors (low salary, inability to get a job in a place Id like to live, continued pursuit of a tenured job/promotion. I have a pretty good publication record (~20 pubs, all in top 50% journals (some in the top journals in my field), very strong teaching evals, journal editorial boards, etc). Im good at my professor job, but have not landed a job that satisfies my criteria and Im losing faith that will happen. The research Ive done is primarily qualitative (interviews, ethnography, etc.) in nature. Theres more to the story, but I wont bore with further details. 

&amp;nbsp;

Im considering a straight up career switch to data science. Im considering this for a number of reasons. 1) Im interested in the various bodies of knowledge that make up the field (programming, stats, trends, problem solving). 2) The field is up-and-coming and the long term job prospects are good in all areas related to data science, 3) Id be able to work in a city near to my family/a place I want to live (location very often a compromise when seeking academic jobsyou have to go where there is a need for you in a field with lots of people and limited opportunities). 4) I think Id be good at it. Im ready and willing to learn. I have strong soft skills like problem solving, critical thinking, presentation skills, argumentation, communication, etcand I think complementing a data science degree with my soft skills would make me very marketable.

&amp;nbsp;

Heres where I find myself: I have basic stats skills, but would need refreshers. My math skills are out of date. I dont know how to program. Ive been reading lots of articles about the data science field, the skills required, etc. Ive started to remedy these flaws by doing online math courses at Khan Academy and programming courses on CodeAcademy and CodeSchool. 

&amp;nbsp;

Im considering pulling the plug on my academic career and pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics/Data Science. I would be able to do this as my wife works, we have money saved, and are in a financial position to pursue this path. Im considering this path seriously because I would need to learn many basic skills to succeed as a data scientist/analyst. I would have to learn programming, advanced stats/math, and lots of the other technical skills required to succeed in this new (possible) career.

&amp;nbsp;

Is this a smart/not smart path considering my circumstances and current knowledge and skills level?

&amp;nbsp;

I looked up M.S. programs as well, but many of them require background in stats/math/programming that I just currently dont have. They feel way too much like jumping in the deep end to me.

&amp;nbsp;

Is it possible with my background to simply continue completing online courses and end up with a decent career in data science? I feel like this is a hard sell in terms of career switching as my current background has nothing to do with data science.

&amp;nbsp;

If youve read this far, I truly appreciate it and would love to hear your input on my situation. I again apologize if there are too many of these posts around here. On a personal note, Ive felt really lost career wise for about 18 months now. Its been a long story and rough ride at some points. The academic world is very unkind at times. This is a field that Im excited about and I think Id be good at it. Id greatly benefit from people who might have thoughts on how this almost 40 academic might pull of a career switch at this point in my life.

&amp;nbsp;

I know pulling this off wont be easy. Im a good learner and I know it will take dedication to learn all these new skills and ways of thinking. I know I can do it. Im just not sure about the smartest way to do so.

&amp;nbsp;

Bachelor's Degree? Online classes and then a Master's Degree? Directly into a Master's? This is a terrible idea, fuck off!? I'd appreciate your honest thoughts.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading.

My only reservation with that is that it's not as intensive.

Hi there. I'll keep it simple. 

I want to become a data scientist. How am I getting there? I currently work as an iOS developer to pay the bills while I learn data science on the side. I am not a computer science major. I had to teach myself this stuff. Why work as an iOS developer and not dive straight into Data Science? Cause I need moolah to get to where I want to get. I don't have the money to afford courses so this is my way of acquiring a substantial amount of capital so that I can actually take those classes which will help fill in my gaps. Ie Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calc II &amp; III etc. 

I've hired a tutor. And that's helped a lot. I believe I could teach myself a lot of this stuff (not all of it, but a lot). But I'm not sure if I 'm following the right path or not. I'm also in the search of an additional mentor. 

I'm also wondering if I should just enroll in an MS program and cut to the chase. That's fine if that's the case but even then I'd have to save money. Again. I'm just not sure of what to do.

Very new to the data science world, and was wondering if someone could point me in a direction... any direction. 

The problem I'm trying to solve is:

* I have a market place
* At practically every instance/point in time, my supply outweighs my demand
* Only a portion of my supply is sellable
* The portion of my supply that is sellable can also go back into the supply pool - similar to how a consultant can take on multiple projects at once
* For every 'supply' there is an ideal set of matches on the 'demand' side

What are some basic models that can help me:

* Manage my 'supply' so that they can always find their ideal 'demand' counterpart?

I'm not looking for an answer, but maybe a few models I should explore e.g. Is this a multiple regression problem? Should I do TF-IDF and then match using something else? Etc.

Long term, I plan on pursuing a career in data science, by doing either a masters or PhD in the subject and then going to work in tech/business. I was wondering what people here think about what my best option is from the following available paths (University of British Columbia, in case anybody was interested):

* computer science
* combined degree in compsci and mathematics
* compsci and statistics
* Cognitive Systems: Computational Intelligence and Design ( The Cognitive Systems Program is a multi-disciplinary undergraduate program involving 4 departments: Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy and Psychology. COGS provides students with a thorough grounding in the principles and techniques used by intelligent systems (both natural and artificial) to interact with the world around them..) 
* Physics

I was originally planning to do my undergrad in physics, but realized that longterm I want a job and want to make money. I'm best set up to do my degree in physics (based on my first year at the university), and I've heard of data scientists who followed a similar path, but I was wondering if it's worth it to switch to one of the other programs listed above. Thanks in advance for any advice you're willing to offer me.

I declared my CS major. However, I would like to add another major since I like to have a highly structured schedule and I want to be the best data scientist I can be.

Math at my school is very theoretical and proof based, which I know would help me with CS but I am afraid that I will grow bored due to the theoretical nature. I really like math but I like to apply it to interesting problems.

Physics at my school is what people who don't like pure math tend to flock to. I like physics, but I am worried that I will be bored due to the fact that I don't care too much for hands-on experimental research (I just want someone else to do the experiments and to give me the data lol). That being said, there are only two required labs in the curriculum so this shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Economics at my school can be made pretty quantitative and the whole discipline is pretty much built on applied math and stats. My concerns are that economics tends to be a hyper-competitive department at my school, and I often question the scientific validity of the discipline. 

Any advice?",13,0
