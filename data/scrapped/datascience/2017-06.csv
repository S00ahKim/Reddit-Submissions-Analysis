I guess I'm looking to see if anyone here has knowledge or experience with these particular programs, or enough general knowledge of the field to make some kind of judgement. I already have my own opinions and have done some research of course, just trying to see if there's anything I hadn't considered.

1. SMU

* Curriculum: 
https://datascience.smu.edu/academics/curriculum/coursedescriptions/  Seems decent based on what I've been able to gather. I've been told machine learning is integrated into several of the courses already so I shouldn't be alarmed by the lack of a required machine learning class, although they will also be launching a dedicated machine learning course soon that I would likely take.

2. Northwestern 


* Curriculum: http://sps.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/pdfs/2016_Grad_Program_Curricula_2016-17.pdf (scroll down to pag 16).  This is ""predictive analytics"" rather than Data Science, but the differences don't seem huge other than perhaps more of an emphasis on the statistics side of things vs computer science.

3. Regis

* Curriculum: http://www.regis.edu/CCIS/Academics/Degrees-Programs/Graduate-Programs/MS-Data-Sciences.aspx (scroll down to program requirements). 

That last program I'm not as familiar with, but it's substantially cheaper than the other 2. The total cost for Regis is ~25k vs ~50k for the other 2. The ""name brand"" of the school is weaker, but that's not necessarily a huge deal if the program is decent.

I'm aware these are all fairly pricey (especially the first 2), but it's a cost I'm willing to pay. Currently I don't make all that much in my BI role (around 60,000), and I'm hoping one of these will be able to help me transition to a higher paying job, hopefully at least in the $85,000 range, so it should pay for itself quickly (and improve my happiness quite a bit by getting me into a vastly more interesting job). Of course there are much cheaper ways to get a lot of this knowledge, but I think based on how I learn and my general personality type this type of program would work the best for me (plus, there is some value to just having a Master's degree to get your foot in the door/help your resume stand out).

Any thoughts or advice are appreciated, assuming it's at least reasonably educated (I'd rather not just get random baseless conjecture/speculation muddling up my thoughts). Thanks in advance!

I'm looking to change my career and get into Data Science / Data Analysis. I'm looking around online and finding online courses and certification programs to help me get my feet wet but I'm curious as to how much weight they hold on a resume versus lets say an online portfolio of examples of successful coding in different environments. If you have any suggestions for books, online courses, or certifications for different aspects of the field that have actual meaning in the field would be very useful for me.

As for my background I have a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics, Bachelors Degree in Education, Masters Degree in Mathematics, and I did 2 years work of work toward a PhD in Mathematics Education before leaving the program. During my Masters I worked with R for a semester (mostly for hand coding the bootstrap method). During my PhD I worked with SPSS. Beyond that I've learned C++ and Visual Basic, but I don't use them regularly so I am rusty. Additionally I know Mathematica very well, and have used some Operations Research software for both stochastic and deterministic OR problems. 

My original thought was to learn SAS over the summer as well as SQL, but now I'm looking into Tableau as well. Any advice or guidance in this new world would be appreciated. Thanks.",3,3,False,self,,,,,

* a full stack developer that gains most of his experience in coding with Python/Java, sql, javascript, code testing

My goal would ultimately be to get a job as data scientist, possibly focused on building models/AI rather than a data engineer focused on the infrastructure.

I have recently started teaching myself R and Python since I have always been enamored with data, I have always wanted to tell stories using it. Now I see that there are a ton of articles here about Data Science and how to become a DS, but I want to take it a step further and actually create a self taught community that can put the ""how to"" into action.

Naturally, I started a blog and Facebook page to chart my lessons and to challenge myself to put my classes to use, and I realized that the best way for me to learn was helping others learn the same material, and I want to bring that same mentality to others. I'll also be posting topics, lessons from others that I find, and generally anything that can help anyone get into the field. 

If anyone here wants to join up, you can find us on Facebook by searching ""Data Science. Simplified"" and liking the page. 

I appreciate the time, and I hope to see you on the page soon. 

(Also, with the page being new, I am looking for people to help run it if they have any free time) 

tl;dr
I made a new page, I would like to find other like minds and start a detailed discussion/page/community together.

***edit to the edit*** (I cant place words properly...)

There is a new blog post up, and it has the links to join up the new group Slack channel and Discord server. IF this is a more convenient way to communicate, I invite you to take a quick moment to check it out. Thanks again for giving some time to read. ",32,53,False,self,,,,,

A few weeks ago I submitted a post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/69zyfr/detecting_external_influencers_on_reddit/)) asking for some suggestions on how to improve a heuristic based vote manipulator detection python script. 

I haven't had much success, but I agreed to share my code and I'd love for anyone else to take a stab at it! The [github](https://github.com/benrules2/influencers) project is here, and a blog post with a longer write up can be found [here](http://www.cyber-omelette.com/2017/05/detecting-reddit-vote-manipulation.html).

Here's the rapid fire version. This script has two modes of operation. The first is to look at a single post, and look at the first 5 users who commented (configurable in the code to more than 5). I believe the earliest commenters will be the most likely to have been bought. Their account age, karma, number of interactions in the specific subreddit are gathered, along with a graph of interactions with other users in the thread.

The second mode of operation is the gather a ""fingerprint"" for the subreddit, but repeating the above steps but for a group of posts.  Right now I'm grabbing the top 50 sorted by week. This gives you an average value for all the above stats, and writes each individual post's stats to csv.

The idea being that if something suspicious is going on, the single post will have a major outlier from the collection of posts. So far I haven't been able to get anything concrete from it though.

I have also used the csv output for a group of posts to look for outliers and then check if there's anything suspicious about it. Again, no signal.  

I've also just started a new job, so my business hours redditing will be pretty infrequent and I may be slow to respond to discussion. Don't fret, I'll respond eventually! ",0,5,False,self,,,,,

I understand how the CNN is going to work on my data, but I need advice on how to set it up in Keras.

In my dataset, each datapoint is structured as follows. There are *n* columns, each of which is sensor data of people performing an action. There are 10 rows where each row is a single person's sensor data for that event. The label column is a score for how well they performed. Since each of their performances is related, each datapoint is a 10 by *n* matrix, and the label column for each data point is a 10 by 1 vector of scores.

In my first layer (at the least), I want to set up convolutional neurons (I'm starting with 5, and moving on from there) so that each row shares weights amongst the observations, in such a way that the order I put the row in the datapoint doesn't matter (aside from it's correspondence with the label).

I recently got into a MS in Data Science program. I am unsure if I should even enroll in the MS in Data Science program. I have read a lot of reasons about why I should not enroll in this type of program. Some of the reasons are:

*  Programs are young.
* They can be easy because they are young and not worth the investment.
* You can gain all the skills via MOOCs and self learning for a fraction of the cost.

While I understand all of these reasons, a lot of Data Scientist jobs I have seen online ask for a minimum of a masters in a quantitative discipline. I feel like an MS in Data Science would allow me to get through this hurdle.

My background is a BA in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science and I think I have a decent technical background and consider myself a decent programmer and have learned statistics, discrete math, calculus, and linear algebra while in school, but my degree is not quantitative. So would this masters be worth it? Thanks for your help!

My understanding is as follows:

Divide your data set up into k stratified sections. Now perform an iterative procedure where you perform a traditional train/test split and one alternating section is used as the testing set. At the end of this iterative procedure (k iterations), each of the k # of sections has been used to represent testing data.  Next, you average all of the accuracies of the splits and this is a representation for the overall accuracy. The model you use is the split that gave you the highest accuracy.

&amp;nbsp;


I have three questions:


1 - Supposedly, the benefit of this is that your model will have been both trained and tested against each data point in your training set which doesn't really make sense. Haven't you simply picked the model that gave the highest accuracy (which is just a specific train/test split)? 



2 - How is the overall accuracy the average of all split accuracies if we are sticking to one model which is shown to (probably) perform better than the others? Wouldn't the best estimate for overall accuracy be the specific accuracy for the best model since that is the model we are using? We aren't even using the other models.

3 - It seems that in sklearn you can only use cross-validation to give accuracies of each of the splits. How would you go about training a classifier using the best model from a cross-validation and applying it to future data?",1,3,False,self,,,,,

Apologies if this is the wrong place for this- would be happy to post elsewhere if needed.
 
I needed help creating an equation for ranking items based on average evaluation scores, with the caveat that each item will contain multiple, varying data points (not all items will have the same amount of scores), AND, if any item receives a star (score of 100), I do not want to even consider the other scores contained within that item.
 
For example:

* Item A receives scores of:

100 (star)

12.5

25

* Item B receives scores of:

12.5

25

50

50

* Item C receives scores of:

12.5

12.5

* Item D receives a score of:

12.5

* Item E received a score of:

100 (star)
 
Looking at the above, since item A contains one score of 100, the subsequent scores are moot, and I would want to rank item A as highest as possible (along with item E).  Since item Bs scores add up to more than 100, but do not contain an individual score of 100, I would rank the items as follows:
 
**A and E as both 100 AND Item B lower than items A and E**

Now my question is, what would be the best way to rank items B, C, and D, in relation to A&amp;E? While I am inclined to average each items scores up, how would I accurately rank items C and D, to show that item C received two scores of 12.5 and item D received one score of 12.5.


For the purposes of my analysis, I need to cap the score at 100.

I've chosen to do some work on the New York crime data - basically predicting the type of crime. The link to my notebooks is [exploration notebook and prediction notebook](https://github.com/IanQS/Machine-Learning-mini-projects/tree/master/data_exploration)

I do have some self-criticisms but I'm not sure how to address them so I'm hoping the collective wisdom here can help? 

**Explore:**

1) Map data. I've plotted it but ""so what""? I don't know how to draw any conclusions from it. Anyone have any resources? 

2) I've dropped some variables, for example datetime (dd/mm/YY) and kept day month year, since I reason that the model should be able to ""reconstruct"" the datetime if all of it turns out to be important. I'm not sure if this is a valid assumption, or if what I'm doing is wise. 

**Predict:**

1) I'm defining ""correct"" if the class is the same, but I feel like my error function is wrong. I feel like I should be using cross entropy during the training process but I have no idea how to do that...

2) I feel like using real numbers to represent my classes is wrong and that I should be using One-Hot Vectors since there's no real ""distance"" between a class 1 and a class 2. I'm not sure if this opinion of mine is correct.

Also, I figure I should probably share the dataset. I'm not sure what the common method is so if people could suggest that it would be much appreciated

Not sure if it is possible to make one that is flexible for most business use cases and can be used by users of various backgrounds.  But first some background:  I am part of a business resource group (BRG) at my company tasked with improving and sharing data analytics knowledge throughout our company.  I am not part of our IT organization, but on the business side. I am a data analyst with several years (19+) of experience at an automobile manufacturing company in the U.S. - sorry not Tesla :-).  

I have a degree in Industrial Engineering with Python, Pandas, Jupyter notebook, scikit-learn, etc, knowledge stack under my belt.  Our business resource group consists of members from diverse backgrounds, which includes some IT members.  So that should help, I hope.  It is supported or backed by one of our executives for overall support.  Very few of our members have programming backgrounds and probably don't know their way around a terminal.  I would say most have the skill sets of a typical entry level to mid-range data analyst (proficient in SQL, Excel, and one or more BI tools like Tableau or QlikView).  I, along with some others, fall in the ""power users"" crowd.  We have a few Python people and even fewer R people.
  
Ideally, I would like this analytics lab to be an environment that is conducive to reproducibility and ease of use.  It would also be language or technology agnostic as possible, but mostly geared towards open source technology.  
  
My first thought would be to focus on infrastructure and/or use of virtualization software.  My ideal environment would be for users to be able to setup or duplicate the environment or analytics project from another user without having to perform complex installation procedures.  I have used VirtualBox in the past and I think our IT uses VMWare.  So I was thinking maybe leveraging these type of virtualization software for this analytics lab.  I should also mention that our users are not all located in the same building or even in the same part of the country.  So that needs to be taken into consideration.  I haven't had any in-depth discussions with our IT members of our BRG group yet.  I would like to first get some feedback and ideas here.  I know I have some major hurdles, I think especially with our IT, and our budget is very limited.  My company is a fairly big company so our IT is geared towards ""enterprise"" solutions.  We've had solutions provided in the past by IBM, SAS, Microsoft, etc.  But due to major budget cuts, I think our IT is forced to look at open source technologies.  It also helps that they are hearing a lot about Python and R since there is overwhelming interest in AI and machine learning.  We do make heavy use of robotics and machinery that is being converted to adopt IoT-related technologies here at my company.  Our users and IT use various data persistence technologies - anything from sqlite, MS Access, DB2, SQL Server, Hadoop, and MongoDB.  We supposedly have a ""data lake"" somewhere too.  Of course, we also have the usual BI tools whose use are scattered throughout our company like Tableau, Business Objects, and QlikView.
  
Then I think the next general direction would be to let the business use cases or problems drive or dictate what tools or solutions to research or use.  We definitely don't want to jump right into tools or technology first, but to first understand the business problems that need to be solved, learn from and meet with subject matter experts, and then worry about tools.  
  
Anyways, I think this is about it.  Sorry for the long post.  Thanks for reading!

I have a B.S. in Applied Math w/ minor in stats and graduated with a 3.85 GPA.

I'm looking to start pursuing my masters degree as I am 23 years old and ready to staple down a strong foundation for my future sooner than later.

My current options: 

 Return to my alma mater for a MS in stats. This University has a stats program that has seen better days but also may have a bright future if things go well. I am familiar with the environment and some of the professors since I took some upper level stats electives while I went for my math degree. I want to do this part time with my job so I don't have to quit since I don't want to take the pay cut. I'm making near 50k in the midwest area currently.

 Go to nearby university and pursue a MS in Business Analytics

 Quit my job and pursue a more advanced degree related to biology/chemistry and math/stats (bioscience, bioinformatics, etc.) full time at a nearby university and take a big pay cut as a TA


Now onto what I want to do with my career:

I have some computer science experience and am fairly well versed in basic programs such as Excel, JMP and SQL. I have only began to start using R as my company is behind on times in the data department (they are currently undergoing a data overhaul to make things better).

I have experience working on predictive analytics models and have had a fair amount of exposure to SQL to the point where I feel that I can generate useful queries rather easily.

My career interests are definitely not in insurance. Biostatistics interests me for sure and possibly machine learning (I don't have enough exposure to say if I believe I would enjoy this or not) in various industries but moving in the future to the west or more tech areas is something that possibly interests me.

I currently have no undergrad school debt and am beginning to start saving up more for my future.

Any ideas or possible routes that I could take in addition to these would be great. Recommendations on my situation would be very much appreciated.

Was hoping to get some feedback on something I've been working on recently, and see if anyone was interested in collaborating on a project.

In the spirit of all the political happenings these days, I thought it would be cool to try and build an ML classifier to predict whether a twitter user is a political bot account based on their profile information. Ideally, I'll like to turn it into a Google Chrome extension in which users would be notified if some of their followers (or a specific profile they're visiting) are suspected political twitter bots.

I have a bare-bones proof-of-concept classifier available here: https://valkommen.pythonanywhere.com/ where a twitter url can be entered (e.g., https://twitter.com/wilson2823), and the classifier outputs a probability of ""bot"" or ""not bot"".

Where the collaboration comes in, is I need help from someone who is experienced in JavaScript and/or building Chrome extensions to make this happen.

So, does this seem like a worthwhile thing to try? Is anyone out there actually experienced in building extensions and would like to help? Thanks for your feedback!",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Our naive approach is to load the top n from each factor, take the first of each, and make those the first 3 of the feed. Then take the 2nd from each feed and make that the second 3, and so on and so forth. Ideally, we would have some algorithm for more intelligently ranking these feed items - our first thought was to simply sum the three heuristics and pull the top items using the resulting combined score, but there are no guarantees that the heuristics are evenly-scaled (or are evenly-scaled for that particular user), which could result in one factor dominating over the others in the feed.

I ran t-SNE (BH Optimized Sklearn version) on a ~150,000 X 4000 dense matrix of data. The original dataset was a sparse matrix with shape ~150,000 X 700,000. I reduced the dimensionality of the original using Sklearn's TruncatedSVD, retaining ~80% of the variance.

My problem is: after running for 37 hours on a 64GB, 16-core VM in Azure Cloud, my code resulted in a Memory Error. I have no idea why this happened. I have gotten memory errors before while running t-SNE, but they almost always happen relatively quickly after starting the process. And, that was mostly the result of a previous implementation of t-SNE that scaled O(n^2); whereas, the current complexity of Sklearn's t-SNE implementation is O(n log n), so confused why the script failed with a memory error.

I'm now turning my attention to finding a job, and seeing as I intend to find one in the data industry I need some guidance. First I'll list some of my experience and skills:

1.  Curriculum includes high levels of math and physics
1.  A decent amount of coding - not a wiz by any means but I have experience in MatLab, some Python and C++

1. My master's thesis project was basically processing and imaging raw earthquake data (I don't remember how big the data set, at least 5-10 TB) and analyzing it in a geological setting 
1. A couple summer internships/research positions in which I was exposed to real work and real data

Ever since I started reading about the data industry, it seems that there are a lot of paths one can take. Throughout my job searches I've come across various positions that are very polarizing; those whose requirements I generally meet, and those that my skill set is nowhere near. 

Ideally, I'd like to develop a skill set that is useful to a company and myself in the longterm. However more often than not, I feel bugged down by all the terms, database languages, and algorithms that I come across. I would really appreciate some general advice, and some questions that I hope could be answered in detail are:

1.  What makes up a strong foundation for a data analyst (coding languages, querying languages, machine learning algorithms, etc.). What is a good blueprint or way to go about building this foundation?

1.  How do different industries (e.g. medical vs. automative) differ in what a data scientist or analyst is required to do?

1.  Should one aim for mastery in a specific skill, or be well rounded in many aspects of data science/analysis?

1.  What is the best way to advance my future career? I'm not talking about changing  positions every other year, but how do I stay relevant and avoid stagnation?

Lastly, I realize that there are many great resources online to learn different skill sets. I came across https://www.coursera.org/ that offers courses in various topics. What is the general opinion of their data courses?

I've done some searching around on here and haven't found anyone who was in my exact situation. I'm starting a 12-week data science bootcamp in a few weeks, where I will learn Python, R, and Hadoop and come out with several projects as a portfolio. I'm lucky enough to have the financial support of my parents right now, so I have a few months of headway after the conclusion of the bootcamp before I need to really start worrying. 

Some background:
I have a bachelors in chemical engineering (with a ~3.2 gpa from an average state school, if that matters at this point), and have a 3 month chemistry R&amp;D internship and a year of chemical process support (hands-on work with hardware both in the office and at customer sites, as well as data analysis and some meddling with Python to try and automate a process). The customers in question are semiconductor manufacturers, so I'm hoping some recruiter finds the fact that I've worked in overseas semiconductor manufacturing cleanrooms interesting enough to call me in (yeah, right). Anyway, my technical skills for this job would be data analysis with Excel and macro creation with Excel and VBA. Like I mentioned earlier, I dabbled in some Python while at this job - I spent some time actually learning the language to try and parse text documents and create charts that specify chemical delivery volumes based on specific events in the log. I really enjoyed trying to create something that worked well, but I really didn't have enough time because of how hectic the rest of the job was. 

So yeah, any advice? I'm on the east coast in case that matters as well

Great insights, funny as hell, and ahead of the curve on many accounts (talking about market network effects back in 2004).

Some recurring memes he writes about are:

- the limitations of focusing on 1 language, and value of learning [radically](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions) different ones

- every software solution fails to cover all needs due to irreducable complexity (e.g. [None Such Beast](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/nonesuch-beast))

Off-course, this was all written more than decade ago. Since then the open-source scene has exploded in both popularity and functionalities. Python for one has a rather broad scope.

So now for the obvious questions:

- Where does Python fail, its intrinsic limitations? (I'm not talking about that specific algorithm that's implemented only in R)

- Which other languages (eg SQL) and tools are highly valuable, from datasciences point of view?

With R, I figured I can just grab some public csv data sets, screw some values up a bit via excel, then clean said screw ups in R, then run some stats and data visualizations. Automate as much as possible via user created functions.

With SQL, all I can come up with is to log some sort of data manually multiple times a day, each day. What data, I have no clue. Do some joins, then some basic aggregating by factor.

1.  The number of used cars that customer sold to consumers.

2. How many used cars they bought from us.

I dont have:

1. Used car dealerships also sell wholesale.  i do not have how many vehicles they do.  So, this would mean that im underestimating their inventory.

2. Used car dealers get their inventory from trade ins, wholesale resllers , and auction.  different customers will use different channels in different proportions.  I do not know any of these data points.  

So, if im a whole sale reseller, i dont know how many vehicles a car dealer buys from whole sale resllers, so i cant calculate my share.

I can only calculate the proportion of vehicles sold to consumer, that the car dealer buys from us. correct?

I am worried that if I take the PhD, I will be getting a huge pay cut (about half of my current income) and I am not sure whether this will pay out in the end. What value do you think the PhD will add to my career path?

So recently my boss's boss asked me if I would host two of her kids for a day and let them see what an average day in the life is like for an Business Analyst like myself. They're both going into their junior year of high school in August, so they're getting close to the time when they will need to choose which schools to apply to, as well as choose which major to declare on their application. She wants to expose them to a few different kinds of jobs before they start that whole process.


My problem here is that I can't really figure out how to make my job duties seem remotely interesting to an outsider. Nor is there really much of an opportunity to show them around or do a hands-on demonstration with physical tools or equipment, because the job is conducted 100% on a computer.


And nobody wants to sit there the *entire* day watching some asshole just sit there and write SQL queries, debug said SQL queries, pull the results into Excel or Tableau, and then create some powerpoint slides. I do absolutely intend on spending a good chunk of time going through stuff like that, because that's pretty much the core of my job. But it would really suck if that's all I did.


Given that, I've come up with a couple ideas for engaging activities I can do instead:

* Pick out an interesting open source dataset that at least somewhat pertains to their interests and use it for a simple, fun analysis (maybe something on colleges)

* Go through a couple web-based sandboxes such as [this neural network sandbox](http://playground.tensorflow.org/)

* Go out on campus and actually collect some basic data on something, then analyze it

* Create a Tableau dashboard that uses information collected at the zip code level and their personal preferences to rank zip codes by how much they'd want to live there

I was thinking maybe I could do ML together using R (from this [book1](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Second-Brett-Lantz/dp/1784393908/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497714931&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=machine+learning+r) and [book2](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Example-Raghav-Bali/dp/1784390844/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497714931&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=machine+learning+r)). Or should I just stick to learn R only for normal statistical/modelling/visualize of data and do ML (and possibly DL) in Python? ,15,5,False,self,,,,,

Hi Friends, I'm graduated in 2015 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering (concentrated in energy systems). Looking for a job with greater location mobility and I've also always loved stats, so I'm thinking of delving into data science. I don't have much programming experience and my stats (though I love it, is currently up to introductory college level). I have many a student debt but I'm wondering if any of you would recommend going to a conference like this given my truly novice level and the cost? Also, any tips related to getting into the field would be largely appreciated. ~&lt;3 Mel

2.  After many years of bouncing around, I started taking some MOOCs which led me to eventually completing a Master's in Analytics Degree

3.  I got hired on over a year ago by a Fortune 100 company to do 'data science', but it turns out that most of the tools required to do such work (R, Python) are not approved for use due to the open source component -- SAS is approved, but my department still hasn't received its licenses.

4.  I work with billions of rows of data on a daily basis using Teradata/SQL and find trends, inconsistencies, make recommendations, etc., but I'm really missing the predictive side that I studied so hard to learn.

Eg, white people should be unduly refused loans at the same rate as black people, men vs women, etc.

Does anyone know any good data sets to try this out on that include this sensitive information?

Thanks! 
CeleryMan35



Edit:  People seem to be misunderstanding what I am saying.  


What I want to ensure the confusion matrix looks the same for each demographic.  This will algorithm include race and gender.  It will use these sensitive parameters to inform which non-sensitive factors can be acceptably used.  


Eg, Location vs Recidivism.  If using location produces a reduction in RMSE, but also causes the algorithm to improperly exonerate more white people, and not improperly exonerate the same number of black people, any algo will use it.  I want to create an algorithm with a Loss function that will optimize RMSE along with balance in the confusion matrix:  Ratios of false positives to false negatives.  


If this ratio is balanced between demographic groups, an algo cannot be accused of being biased against any demographic group, as it will be misclassifying each at an identical rate.


This would permit nonparametric modeling in areas that have previously been disallowed: Eg, consumer insurance.  ",5,1,False,self,,,,,

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Biology, and I feel as if that is the biggest mistake I have made for myself. When I started college I was eager to succeed and become a dentist. I never thought about doing anything else besides that, but as my grades plummeted I realized that the path I envisioned just wasn't going to happen. I struggled through my tough science classes and it felt like a drag and it even took me an extra year to complete my bachelors but I finally got the degree that holds zero value for me. Every time I sit and try to come up with a plan on what to do next I feel as if a heavy rock has been placed on me. But the clock is ticking and it doesn't stop for anyone, so I do need to figure out what my next step is on this road to success. So far I have thought about doing nursing, I never wanted to do that but with my background in science and poor GPA it seems to be a valid option. My second thought was completely changing my field of education and trying for the IT field. But for that I have no idea where to beginning from. I know Data Science is a huge growing field right now and they earn well also. But how do I figure out that that is the career path for me? I am afraid to make the wrong choice and regret it later or waste my time. I know, I know, that is life and I cannot be afraid of it if I want to go somewhere. I need to stop thinking the ""buts"" the ""what ifs"" and go for something already, as of right now I'm wasting time regardless. Honestly, I just want to make a lot of money with a slightly easier path than becoming a doctor of some sort. Just look at the Kardasians, living in millions for doing what? I always thought about becoming a Youtuber, I am a creative person, I want to be famous, who doesn't? Or be one of those Instagram models? Why not? It all seems nice to think about but not practical for the future, or I just don't have the courage in me.
What my nursing friends tell me- they started making 93K and only have to work 13 shifts a month- that's like working 150 days out of 356 days. Sounds nice but why hasn't this pushed me to do that then. Going for the corporate world means working a 9-5pm job M-F. I ask myself do I want to wear scrubs for the rest of my life or business wear, nice pencils skirts? And I honestly don't know the answer to any of these questions. Can I get a trial and error at this life. There are an endless amount possibilities I can choose from yet I can't pick any.
The nurses out there, please tell me the pros and cons about what you do. And if this was the route I chose what would my next step be? Should I go for an associates first since my GPA is so low and then do a bridge programs? Is getting a second bachelors degree worth what you guys do?
Anyone in the IT field, (data scientists, QAs, anyone) how do I enter this field with a biology background? Should I find some internship? I looked into those data science boot camps but they seem pricey for something I'm unsure of. Any insight on what your job entails of would help.
Redditters please help me clear up the clutter in my mind, let me know what you would do in my place.

To date, my lack of degree hasn't completely hindered my job prospects, but I am aware that there's a potential glass ceiling in terms of pay, and certain companies are likely to throw my resume out without looking at it due to my lack of schooling.

I can see two options from here (if there are more please let me know!):

1. Going back to college.
Is starting from scratch and undertaking a bachelors degree, before going on to a masters the only option if I wanted to make the jump from being a Data Analyst to a Data Scientist? Or are there schools out there who will overlook the previous lack of schooling and take experience / professional certification into account in lieu of a degree?

2. Trying to get a Data Science role without formal schooling:

All you need to do is tell it which hyperparameters you want it to experiment with, and what values to try out, and it will evaluate all the possible combinations of hyperparameter values, using cross-validation.

&gt; This left out portion can be used to estimate the generalization error without having to rely on a separate validation set. This estimate comes for free as no additional data is needed and can be used for model selection.

And then it lists various estimators that have 'out of the bag' estimates implemented, and RandomForestRegressor is one of them.

I am planning to get my Masters in Data Science which is a pretty big sidestep from English which was my undergrad degree. As a result I have not taken any Math since high-school. To get started I retook PreCalc since I had not taken it since highschool and am now taking statistics. I'm good at math so I am not worried about the course work. That is all that is required for me to enroll in a data science program at the UMUC (University of Maryland online system). As I do not have any experience in computer science the advisor let me know I would need to enroll in a noncredit course before I started my maters course work. 


Is this not a good pathway? 
Should I continue to take math classes before I start to get a better baseline?
What type of computer science classes should I take to improve my baseline.
What is the reputation for online universities in the field is it worth it to apply to a traditional university.

Other potential hypotheses abound, which is why I want to make sure I have enough data.

I'm at about 60,000 articles in my SQLite database now, scraped with a patchwork of BeautifulSoup and regex (I scrape RSS links from the Wayback Machine, then churn those scraped links through another scraper). The news articles go from mid-2017 back to 2014 (mostly), and so far I have articles from the NY Times, LA Times, Vox, CNN, Breitbart, and the Verge (any recommendations for other publications is welcome). I know the answer to ""how much data"" is always ""it depends"", but my original goal of 100,000 articles seems kind of small if I want to be representative across different kinds of news orgs.

So, how much data? And what considerations should I be making as I scrape it? I haven't yet decided on specific algorithms/tools for the actual analysis, but figured Naive Bayes could make an appearance, and probably regression.

Their reply:

""Regarding Python, it is used in a limited way in some of the Computer Science modules, however the modules 1. Fundamental Maths and Stats for Health Data and 2. Biomedical Modelling for Health Data both use the R programming language in delivery and teaching. R has been used primarily in academia and research and focuses on better, user friendly data analysis, statistics and graphical models. Python has more traditionally been used by programmers who want delve into data analysis or apply statistical techniques, and by developers that turn to data science. For exploratory work, R is easier for beginners and that is certainly true for many of the students who join our course as statistical models can be written with a few lines of code. ""

I've used openpyxl and wrote the following code ...

                    # If a match is found, then append the respective serial number (in col-A of second file) to the array
                    matching_serialnumbers.append(str(second_wb_sheet['A' + str(row_of_second_wb)].value))
            except ValueError:

        if matching_serialnumbers:

1. They will want a top X customers to be labeled major accounts.  This should likely be done by revenue.

2. They arent going to want a straight revenue ranking for the other 98% of the customers

So, i decided to create a wallet share estimate for each customer and use that as the target variable in a regression tree.

I would  force the first break done on total revenue to get the major accounts.

then let the tree segment the rest.

is this a right approach to encorporating business requirements to a segmentation request? my thought process ok?

After a few initial phone screens, I was recently told that a company I had applied to would like to have me out for an onsite visit. I was told the salary for the position would be ~$90,000, which seems a bit low for the location, but this would be an entry level position (so maybe this is reasonable?). I was also told that there would be up to 80% travel time, in which we would meet with clients to discuss their needs (i.e., discuss with them what types of data they have available, what they'd like to get out of it, possibly present results, etc.).

The onsite consists of a 20 minute presentation, followed by three 45 minute one-on-one interviews.

My problem is that I'm naturally a pretty introverted person and have a lot of anxiety about this kind of stuff -- the idea of 80% traveling, constantly meeting with different clients in a business setting, presenting results directly to them etc., etc., does not make me feel very good. I just need some opinions on if anyone else has been in a similar situation, whether 80% seems pretty excessive (I know some people love it), etc. This stuff is starting to make me question whether I want this job or not, and I can't decide if it's my anxiety taking over, or if this just really isn't the gig for me.

Do data science jobs exist where the majority of time is spent cleaning and analyzing data rather than meeting with clients and traveling? Thanks!",11,14,False,self,,,,,

You might be seeing this question quite often and I know that because I've read all of them. The problem is I am more confused than ever.
I'm an Indian guy who comes from a poor family. I always loved computers but my financial condition never allowed me to pursue it, as engineering is quite expensive in India.
So after passing intermediate, I opted for commerce. I had zero interest in it tho. 
After doing Bachelor in Commerce, I got a job as a data analyst in a marketing firm where I came to know about data science and it lights up my hopes of being able to do what I always wanted to do.
Fortunately, with the sheer amount of data that we have to work on gave us the opportunity to learn Python and incorporate it in our daily work. I can't be happier so, I started learning Python and I am in love with it.
I finally have a purpose in life and I am very motivated to work for it at any cost possible.
Now, I need help and after browsing and searching the Internet, I am more confused then ever.
Please help me to build a roadmap for my Journey to be a data scientist.

2)What to study? courses/books/anything

I've gotten interviews for Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, C++ Developer, etc jobs. I've had a fair amount of initial phone screens with HR that rarely lead to a technical interview (I haven't had this problem for the C++ developer roles). I've had some technical phone screens for Data Engineer and Data Scientist roles, but I apparently did poorly on those too and rarely get invited on-site. I'd say I get callbacks at a lesser rate for Data Analyst roles, but at least some on-site interviews for them, whereas I've gotten nearly 0 on-site interviews for Data Scientist/Engineer roles

I've gotten so many different kinds of technical questions or questions about my resume. I've already kept track of the ones I got wrong but I felt I should've gotten correct if I studied more. I spent the necessary time researching those problems to make sure I get them correct next time. But what's frustrating is that I'll rarely get asked a similar question like that again.

I've applied all over the US, but am now focusing on companies close to where I live and the Bay Area, as I pretty much only get on-site interviews for them. I already have a Github, my own website, etc.

Thing is, I'm actually having some trouble approaching what I thought should be a reasonably simple problem given my Econ background. I want to give price modeling in R (given some clearing demand and a rough aggregate supply) a shot, and I think I have everything I need, but it seems like I just have a mental block about it.

My dataset has power quantities (in megawatts) and price bids pertaining to each individual electricity generator (commercial) for a state in the US, as well as telemetric data on how much electricity was actually generated, over 15-minute intervals throughout the day. At first glance, the setup seems fairly simple: the sum of telemetric generation data in each quarter hour is my clearing demand curve, and the sum of all the quantities (at the given bid price) associated with each generator during that quarter hour is the supply curve. 

I have two roadblocks, though. First, there's not just a single curve for the price/quantity related to the bids; ***there's 13***, and I'm not sure how to go about aggregating them. Second, how do I handle the cyclical nature of this data in R? To clarify, in the CSV I have, the first 517 rows have all the observations for each generator at 12 AM, the next 517 have the same observations but at 12:15 AM, the next 517 have the same observations but at 12:30 AM, and so on. If I load this into data.tables, is there a way to aggregate by timestamp (which is a feature/column in the dataset) so that I can model discretely instead of stepwise per 15 minutes? 

I can pass out the dataset if anyone wants to take a closer look, and clarify my thought process as much as possible if people want more on that. Thanks very much in advance for any suggestions, and cheers!",0,3,False,self,,,,,

So far I can only think that because RF employs Bagging (Bootstrapepd Aggregating) that it stands a good chance of not overfitting and the decision trees capture true information gain so thats great for discerning feature importance. 

If anyone has any industry insights into why one might use LR or RF in particular, I'd love to hear.

They choose Daily Climate Report

They would select their city:  Fresno

A new window opens with the data.

The user is specifically looking at:  Precipitation (IN) - Yesterday row.  The column is the ""Observed Value""

That's that only data they want.  However, they want to be able to collect this daily going foward (even though it'll only show the day before).  She also wants to go back in time and collect all of 2017.

I'm new to Reddit, but I worked on a personal data science project where I downloaded a lot of recent Trump tweets and analyzed which words were used together in the same tweets. For example, if the words ""they"" and ""gone"" and ""Hello"" were in the same tweet, they were marked down. I did this for groupings of 2, 3, and 4 words (I tried 5 and my computer crashed). I was able to see things like ""Make America Great Again"" and ""Crooked Hillary"" towards the top. I didn't know where to put this data, but my friends said Reddit, so here it is. Also, this is still a work in progress, there may be some bugs (I've noticed that empty strings end up being checked sometimes).

Also, I'm not taking any sides with this. I just know that Trump tweets a lot, so I figured I could do something with that.

There are 3229 tweets that I analyzed, going back to May 2016. Here are the results I found were relevant (sorry for the poor  formatting, I'm still new to reddit, and I don't want to publish my files).

While my daily job does involve data modelling, the technical level and understanding required are not necessarily high. Most solutions just work because there is no prior foundation to compare against. It makes me feel like I am unable to truly improve as a data scientist by just my daily work alone. It also doesn't help that I am still at junior level, and while I have theoretical background on most algorithms, I find it difficult to know when to apply which technique, what kind of data works best with it, or how to determine the best metric to optimize.

After some quick searches, use case interview questions (especially those from the big tech companies like facebook or airbnb) really sparked my interest. [Here](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Facebook-Interview-RVW14402094.htm) are some examples. I found myself struggling to come up with reasonable answers for most questions. 

In the process, I found this book http://datascientistjobinterview.com/ which looks like exactly what I am seeking but there are not many reviews available for the book, which makes me a bit hesitant.

My goal is not just to pass some interviews. I want to improve my overall data science and analytical abilities, so I can come up with and give reasoning for solutions for most industry problems that appear in interviews.

What would you advise me to do? Take a look at the book above, or participate in some Kaggle competitions, or something else?

Thanks in advance.",14,39,False,self,,,,,

I'm not experienced using k-means clustering, so excuse my ignorance. 

&amp;nbsp;



I have a set of 15k images, that I wish to cluster into 'visually similar images'. That is, I wish to cluster them into groups that, for humans, appear to be similar. ""humans"" being the key-word. I would ask human observers to judge how visually similar each set of 2 images appears, and use this judgement as the distance between these 2 images. (i.e. on a range of 0-10, 0 being not at all, 10 being identical, how similar are these images? &gt; 0 being infinite distance, 10 being no distance)

&amp;nbsp;




In theory, I would want to collect the distance from each image compared to each other image, but using (n^2 -n)/2 would be (15k^2 -15k)/2 = 112 million distance, which would mean I'd need 100m+ human judgement. Yikes, that'd be very very very expensive. 

&amp;nbsp;


Instead I though, maybe I could do it like this*: I could take 2 or 3 smaller samples from my 15k images, each smaller sample being size around 100 images. For each separate sample, I'd collect the distances (only around 10 to 15k judgements now &gt; affordable), and then for each sample I'd perform a cluster-analysis. Then, if the clusters are very similar, I could make the assumption that these clusters, found in each of the smaller samples, are also (to a certain extent) present in the  15k images. 

&amp;nbsp;

My question, how small or large would my 'smaller samples' need to be to do something like this?
