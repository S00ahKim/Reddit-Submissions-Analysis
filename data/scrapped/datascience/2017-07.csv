Before this I went through a coding boot camp and had a couple side projects I was doing after the boot camp until I got the job.  
  
Anyways, so my current job is doing ETL work but it's not traditional ETL, more like cleaning/matching data for different clients helping them with some type of analysis usually. We mostly deal with marketing companies or departments so most of the data I deal with is customer info, prospects etc. So I got hired in the same day as the first data scientist at the company who is technically the ""Director of Analytics"". So he will actually be building a DS team over the next couple years or so.  
  
In my interview I told them I want to be a data scientist in the future and that has been a goal for me for since I started learning about data science. So my goal is to transition to a data scientist role within the company as he is building up the team. So the best part about this is since he is in the process of getting an environment setup and things like that he has been showing me alot of the data science work he does and how to do it. I've been reading some intro to ML books and trying to apply some stuff to the data we have (We have tons of data) and I've been meeting with him weekly to go over the things I learn in the book and data science topics. I'm already in the process of making a NLP model that will classify some fo the custom orders we get so our company can get a better view of whats really going on.
  
One thing I don't want to do is fall into a ""data analyst"" role and more towards data science. So what skills should I focus on to make that would make me be considered more data science than a data analyst? As far as I understand these 2 titles overlap a bit but data science is more focused on predictive analytics, building models and things like that where an analyst is more exploratory analysis. So what skills/knowledge should I know to make me employable as a data scientist in the future. I pretty much have access to all the data we have so should I keep just trying to build models that add value to the company or customers as I'm learning from home? I went to a comm college for 2 years but didn't finish the degree so I'm scared that if I were to leave this company it could be hard for me to find work as a data scientist but I know I can learn and do most things with the available libraries out there. Say I built models that were successful and accomplished some cool things with projects could I get hired as a data scientist in a  year or 2 without the mathematical background and degree?  
  
Sorry long post just want to make sure I focus on the right skills while I have unique opportunity I'm in and have a mentor that is open to helping me.

I have been tasked with building a model that can predict (or try to) a new customer's electricity usage for the next 12 months, without any prior data on their historical usage!

This is incredible hard to do due to the huge variations between individuals and there is very limited data when a customer joins to effectively do this. 

I was wondering if anyone else has been asked to model something that you know just can't be done accurately and how you went about it? 

Secondly, how would you go about modelling this? I figured something Bayesian so I can easily model the confidence around the estimate. 

So far a very basic linear model returns a r squared of 12%, not very good and makes me think its not worth spending much more time on it and using a simple weighted average.",10,6

For example, if the amount of *deposit* transactions above $5 in my dataset is 57:

`
&gt; sum(data1$Value_IN.ETH. &gt; 5)
[1] 57
`
and 5x57 = $285
then I know based on just this evidence that the account has at least had $285 deposited in it or more.

Similarly, if I do 
`
&gt; sum(data1$Value_IN.ETH. &gt; 400)
[1] 1
`

then I know based on just this evidence that the account has at least had $400 in it or more.

Lastly, if I do
`
&gt; sum(data1$Value_IN.ETH. &gt; 1)
[1] 181
`

Then I know based on  just this evidence that it has had at least $181 deposited into it or more.

I am trying to figure out, in a given instance where a random value of the amount of transactions greater than or equal to produces the highest value.

For example even though there is only one transaction above $400, any user knowing that there is at least 1 transaction above $400 can estimate with perfect accuracy a minimum account value higher than any user who only knew there were 57 transactions above $5 and any user who only knew there were 181 transactions above $1.

But suppose there is a user x who knows there are 28 transactions above $100. This user would know with certainty that the account has had at least $100 deposited into it 28 times, or 2,800$, a much higher estimate than anyone else so far.

I am working on a script to automatically clean and structure data that comes from a variety of sources into some uniform format.

I will be receiving spreadsheets from each source that will contain a selection of the following fields (*** indicates data that will always be present):

- First and last name (in the same cell or separate cells)***
- Social security number
- Employee number (not necessarily all numeric digits)
- Address (all in one cell or split over multiple)
- Paycheck size (summed over the month or broken down into pay periods)***
- Work location
- Job type
- Hours worked
- Hourly wage
- Other random garbage data

The formatting and composition of the data can vary dramatically from source to source,and column titles may or may not exist. However each source will likely format the data, at the very least, in a similar format each time we receive it. 

I have broken down the process into several steps:

1) Identify the data field in each column.

2) Group the data fields by entry.

3) Scrap the garbage data and format each entry uniformly so they can then be read in by a different piece of software.

I am using python and am currently on step one. Fields like SSN and monetary values can be easily identified using regular expressions, but I'm running into trouble with values like name, employee number, and address. I'm thinking that machine learning might be the way to go for these values, but I'm having trouble getting started identifying the features I want to use.

Has anyone worked on a project like this before or have any advice on how to get started ?

Thanks!

I get spreadsheets from many sources with different types of personal data and I want to identify which columns contain which class of data so I can clean the spreadsheets. Any advice?",4,2

- MCSE Data Management and Analytics
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- CCA Spark and Hadoop Developer

All three seems useful, but I'm currently leaning towards the latter two because they only require one exam. I'd go with the CCA if it had an official study guide (a textbook) to study from because I like to do organized studying rather than following a bunch of resources online. On the other hand, AWS is popular and will make me a perfect fit for a devops for a machine learning software company.

So I have been working on getting some e-learning done over the summer since finding a decent summer job in my area is a pain in the rear end, and my university gave me a subscription to DataCamp because a couple classes I took last year used it as supplemental material to teach. I've generally been clearing one course a day (about 4-5 chapters) and I complete one of the skill tracks every week or so, keeping written notes on particular functions I come across that I may need in the future as well as backing up all the code for each exercise I've had to type stuff into.

In the meanwhile, I also get free Lynda access from my university, so occasionally I'll look into there for lessons on Excel and such. However I dislike the lack of interactivity with the exercises, but I know Lynda also gives certificates that could look good on LinkedIn and resumes and such.

User flair is just images and/or text that goes next to a person's name when they post in the subreddit, not link flair which is a larger discussion.

Anyways, I would like to know how people feel about it.  Basically, here are the questions I have:

1. **Should we have user flair at all?**  
*(Note: If not, you can skip the rest of the questions.)*

2. **Should users be able to assign their own flair, or should it only be assigned by mods?**  
If assigned by mods, this could either by a case by case basis, or there could be a verification process like in AskScience or AskHistorians.

3. **What kind of flairs should we have?**  
Off the top of my head, I think flair could relate to any of the following: experience level, specialization, role, interest, reason for being in the subreddit, etc.  Or it could just be something fun.

4. **What should flairs look like?**  Flairs can take a lot of shapes and sizes, with images and/or text that may have customizable parts that can be edited by the user (if allowed).

I have seen that the math courses that people recommend most are linear algebra, calculus, and numerical analysis, with some stats peppered in. I will be taking 2 proof based linear algebra courses in my undergrad, and hopefully a graduate level analysis course next fall. 

That being said to do well in these courses I have to devote a lot of time to my math classes, and leaves me with little time to allocate to strengthening my programming skills. So I am wondering if even though I may not spend enough time on programming, will I be able to transition over if I have an adequate background in math?


Edit: I have thought about math grad school, and my adviser suggested the grad level analysis course next fall. Would that be a useful course for a data science career? The reason I ask is because I have seen a few posts mentioning the theory of probability would be helpful, and I know that is backed off analysis.

I don't have a lot of experience with cleaning data/NLI and am a bit worried about creating a messy data pipeline as a consequence. The datapoints in the database have a label but the labels were not applied in a consistent way, so datapoints in the same category have different labels like this:

&gt;Acquired immunodeficiency syndromes

&gt;AIDS

&gt;Acquired immune deficiency syndr

&gt;Autoimmune deficiency syndrome

Now i have thousands of datapoints so I would prefer not doing it manually. Any good ideas would be welcome.

I have a personal request to make. I am a Master's student in USA, having almost completed my courses in Data Science and Engineering, although under EE track not CS track. I have taken courses in Machine learning, Probability, Statistics, NLP and am looking forward to completing my masters by getting some work experience through and internship. I know how hard it is to crack an internship and I am trying my best and giving interviews. 

Here is my request, I seem to find myself uncomfortable in a corporate environment. I have been involved in social work since 8th grade - volunteering at orphanages, slums, old-age homes etc and nothing makes me feel better than helping someone out every single day. Can you all guide me so I can merge both of these worlds together. I know and believe that data can help us solve crucial problems in education, healthcare and in fact any field. How do I look for entry data science roles in such organisations working for social good. Please let me know your thoughts, any organisations which work for such causes, anything at all. Thank you good people! 

PS - I don't have anything against corporates, I just want to add more meaning to my work and life. I am only 23 and I know first I should build my skills and get some work experience. But I feel like if I want to bring about a change, I should start now. 
I am also super shy, so I find it difficult to discuss this with friends and family, especially when people my age don't seem to understand what I believe in. ",13,8

I have some experience with Java, Python, and C.   
The project manager gave me a quick run-down of what they do here. He covered some stuff that I should learn in the next couple weeks (it's a 2.5 month internship). I don't really know where to start learning. Here's the general picture:  
- They are a advertising group that is divided into 3 sectors, Front-End Development, Server-Side Development, and Data Analysis. I'll be in the Data Analysis group.  
- He covered the following program/languages/packages that they commonly use. Flume, Kafka, HDFS, Yarn, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, HBase, NoSQL.   
- Since I'm one of their very first interns (it's a small company started a couple years ago) they don't really have too much experience in mentorship, that's why I'm asking online as well.  
- From what I've seen in the past 2 days, they mostly use Python/Java/Scala to write their code.  
Honestly I'm just a bit overloaded as it's a ton to take in, I'd appreciate if I could get maybe a walkthrough to help learn everything I need. Preferably free resources.  
I'm just hoping by the end of the summer I can work on a couple projects, maybe some individual projects, build portfolio, and overall learn how to be a data analyst.  
After the summer I'll be entering my 2nd year in college as a Computer Science major with Applied Math, Stats, and Economics minors. However, given the amount of credits I have, I'll be graduating within 3 years so I'd like to get as much work experience as possible. Thanks!",1,3

So as it says in the title, I'm interning as a data engineer (graduating in December with a computer engineering major.) Currently I'm writing applications in python/pyspark to ingest and integrate data into into AWS . I have some knowledge of dataframes thanks to the experience I've had with pyspark but no experience whatsoever with analysis of said data since I'm doing the back-end work for the analytics team. That being said, I was wondering what the best resources are to move forward. I'm really interested in big data analysis but the amount of resources listed here are overwhelming so maybe knowing my background will help you suggest some.

In terms of programming, I would say I have a fair amount of experience. In terms of statistical experience, I don't have much. I'm very much an interactive learner, so if there are any jupyter notebooks that you know of that go through the very basic statistical concepts alongside code using python libraries such as pandas and numpy that would be super helpful. If that doesn't exist, a really good book describing the statistics I would need to know would be great too.

Thanks for listening and I'm all ears for anything you have to say!

I work at [company], and we are beginning a ""data science initiative,"" as my boss calls it. We are responsible for trying to roll this out though the entire company. There is no data science used in the company today. 

I just graduated with a math related bachelor's degree, and was hired as an entry-level data scientist. My boss would like to hire a senior data scientist as well, one with preferably some years of experience. He would like me to participate in the interview process, but after googling some questions to ask, I'm not sure which would be the best. 

Do you guys have any suggestions? I'm new to the field but learning as I go. I don't want to ask the wrong questions if I can avoid it. I'd really like to find someone who can be a mentor to me as well in the field.

**Major(s): Physics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics**

Minor(s): 

**GPA: 3.35 (AMS GPA is 3.6)** bad grades mostly in sophomore year.

Type of Student: International, Male, South Asian

GRE General Test: Will be taking soon. Anticipating &gt; 90% V scores but around 90% Q score.

GRE Subject Test in Mathematics:
How important is it that I take this? I don't really have time to study for another test on top of the GRE and my demanding final year schedule.

**Programs Applying: Masters in Statistics/Masters in Data Science**

Ideally I want to apply for Phd programs but given my crappy undergrad record, I've decided to apply for masters and see if I can get into the Phd programs later on.
 
Research Experience: Essentially none. Did some linguistics research not related to statistics with a pretty famous guy but that was a while ago and no paper came out of it.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Deans List, Physics Honor Society. 

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Irrelevant on-campus job for 3 years and currently doing a data analyst internship at a very small marketing agency.
 
**Letters of Recommendation:** The School is HUGE and all my classes are &gt;100. Its very hard to get to know professors and this is likely the weakest aspect of my application. I will get recommendations from professors I've taken courses with and gotten As but that's about it. I don't even expect them to remember me or know who I am and I just don't see any way around this. I can try to cultivate some relationships till application time in December but I don't really know how to or how successful I will be. 
 
**Course Work:** 

**Math and Stat Courses:** Survey of Probability and Stats (A), Probability Theory (A-), Combinatorics (A-), Data Analysis (A), Deterministic Models (A), Statistical Lab (Basically a course on R programming and SAS), Calculus 1,2,3,4(Taken in Sophomore year so grades are mostly Bs and a C in multivariate), Linear Algebra(A-). Probability and Statistics for Data Science (In Progress)
 
**Physics Courses that may be relevant: **Quantum Mechanics (Some probability and lots of Linear Algebra)(B-), Statistical Mechanics (Lots of probability)(B-)
 
**Computer Science courses:** Object Oriented Programming (A), Data Structures (A-), Analysis of Algorithms (In Progress), Probability and Statistics for Data Science (In Progress), Computational Geometry (combined course by Computer Science and Applied Math department also in progress).

**Online MOOCs:** 4 course specialization in Python by Uni of Michigan (Coursera), 10 course Specialization on Data Science by JHU (Coursera), Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng (Coursera).

**Where should I apply?**
 Ideally I want to go to a Data Science program but these are limited so any good statistics program. What school match my profile? Where would I have a good change to get in and succeed?

How can I improve my application? Is there anything here I can leverage? How can I build enough rapport with a prof to get a good recommendation letter in 1 semester? Do you have any other advice or suggestions? Any other programs you think I should consider? Any other Specific courses I should take?",2,3

If not how?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6m7ipq/calculating_risk_can_this_done_with_probability/,[deleted],1499608153,"Lets say I have 30 products that are offered to our customers.  I bundle those products into 3 Bundles of 10.

The Risk:
The customer can stand pat as is, but if he opts into the bundling program.

The customer has to buy the entire bundle. He also cancels products in the other bundles that he does not buy.  He can buy all 3.

So, a customer could be heavily spending in bundle C and sign up for Bundle A and drops all product C's products. causing a net lose in revenue.

**DataSet**
10,000 customers. different penetration rates amongst the 30 products.  All products are subscription based billed once a month, with revenue data dating back two years. so i can find trend in penetration rates.

**Assumption**
I have an assumption/estimate of how many customers will opt into each bundle. but, not which of the 10,000.

**Question**
Is there a way to quantify risk here using probability?

I mean if we have 10,000 customers and 15% are expected to opt into Bundle A.  We will suffer loses in B and C, but that depends on which 15% of are customers opt in. As some could have alot of products in B and C, some may have none.

Basically, is there a way to calculate **Expected Loss** from this issue?

The reason I ask here is that this seems like something a monte carlo or bayeson stats could solve.

Im good at self learning, but need some direction of where to learn here.

Two reasons for zero daily sales are:

1. Item is not on store shelf due to poor management, this creates missed sales opportunities.


2. Item is on store shelf, but no one bought it.

The company is interested in scenario 1, to pin point stores that have bad management.

The data contains daily sales for 1000 stores, for a whole year, for 10 different products. So for each product, each store, there are 365 days worth of daily sales data. A ""0"" means it was not sold on that day.

The company also sent out people to visit stores daily so we have labels of when a product is on the shelf, and when it is not.

I want to build a logistic regression model to analyze the days when 0 sales occurred for each product/each store, and classify whether it's due to scenario 1, or scenario 2.

Currently, my predictors are product ID, days of the week (Mon, Tue..), size of the store shelf dedicated to a product, ...
but since the sales of previous couple of days can have a huge effect on whether something will no longer be on the shelf, I plan to include sales of the previous day, and also the sales of the day before that in my model.

Problem is, the sales of previous few days can be correlated. Will this cause problem in my logistic model?

What recommendations/advice do you have? Any comments would be appreciated.

Working home 1 or 2 days per week is not going to help me since I can't go anywhere in that time.

In addition to user flair, general moderator duties and various minor changes to the sidebar and wiki, I have been spending time behind the scenes developing content and thinking about the general direction of the subreddit.  At some point it occurred to me that our subreddit has a unique advantage over others.  

**We are a subreddit made specifically of individuals who can use data science to improve our subreddit.**  More than that, we can use our skill set to help develop the entirety of the larger, loosely affiliated Data Science community of subreddits (which I will henceforth call the **Data Science Network**).

To that end, I have started using the reddit API to collect data and perform analyses of interest.  Already, these analyses have helped determine which subreddits should appear on the sidebar, and which users should be given User Flair.

Eventually, I hope to look into questions of user churn/retention, user/post overlap between subreddits, topic modeling, semantic analysis, etc.  In the meantime though, I will just be using analysis where I can.

Please let me know if you have any ideas or would like to help in these efforts.  Just to give you guys an example of the kind of data I am working with, here are the **Top 15 Commenters (by upvotes)** and **Top 15 Data Science Network Subreddits (by subscribers)**:

To give you a bit of background, I was an average student and moved abroad to study marketing at university, completing my BA degree 2/3 years ago. I started working in marketing as an account manager but was always most interested in the analysis aspect of each campaign. I moved roles to a very large global company but still within marketing, in the hopes of doing something more analytical. Essentially I wanted a purely analytical role, so I told the business of my intentions and that I would like to transfer to the analytics team. 

This was back in October 2016. Since then I've completed courses online to learn python and SQL, and back in March there was an opening in the analytics team and I got the role. My current role is more of a data analyst than a data scientist, where I focus mostly on historical data and finding patterns/trends to generate insight for different teams, but it's towards data science that I want to move. I've completed courses on python for data science, and in the last few weeks I've managed to use pandas and other modules in my role in order to start getting some practice in this field, but I'm still lacking a lot of skills.

In the next few months I will start building my first model which will be really good practice, but I'm wondering what I can do in my free time to start building on skills that make a data scientist. I've been touching on the subject of machine learning in my own free time, but I feel like I am lacking the mathematical background to understand it in depth. I'm okay with the technological side of the role at the moment, but it's the mathematics and the logic behind data science that I really want to develop, in order to be able to make the move in the next few years.

Given my background, where do you think I should be focusing at the moment, and what are some good resources to achieve that? Thanks in advance",4,5

I learn better through experience so I'm looking for projects that I can do that will advance me. Also if there is anyone out there willing to include me in one of their own projects with some direction I could be some help.

It contains, gps info (speed,location,time,date,day,rural/urban,timezone,daylightsavings,state,zip,...), behavior factors (seatbelt y/n speeding y/n, stopped,...), harsh driving info (was there a harsh break or accel or decel, etc at this specific ping), and lastly, the info of top 3 locations spent at with distance from them.

I have done eda and found out interesting things,for example, this particular driver seems to drive harshly at lunch hours (maybe driving while eating? Or maybe just traffic) and seems to speed mostly in one state on a single road. I even built a couple models to predict harsh counts and whether or not they will be speeding. I feel as though I am not utilizing this data nearly enough, though.

I'd love to get some thoughts on how to devise a way to get confidence intervals for uplift values.

Let's say a promotion for a product (1 USD off purchase) is being sent out to 10,000 people (Test Group). The Test Group consists of the entire population  eligible for this promotion minus the control group consisting of 1000 people.

Here's how I am currently calculating the uplift -

Pre Period - 52 weeks
Post Period (Redemption Period) - 10 weeks

I am currently calculating uplift by Measuring the difference in Redemption Period Spend for Test Group - Control Group weighted down by a factor accounting for pre-period differences between Test &amp; Control.

Promotional Uplift = Redemption Period Test Spend - (Redemption Period Control Spend * ( Pre Period Test Spend / Pre Period Control Spend ) )

Now, I am just wondering how to apply a 95% confidence interval to this uplift value. Would appreciate any suggestions!

What worries me is that the name of some of the courses are too general and ""catchy"" (I will have taken most of what's in the first year anyway by the time I graduate, even if at an undergrad level). I like the compulsory internship, which from what I know might also take place as a Research Assistant at the University's Institute for Data Science and Analytics. I'm geared towards the Data Science track.

To add some context, I attend the BSc in Economics and Computer Science at the same Uni and thus know (and like a lot) the faculty and will probably talk with my professors once lectures start again, but at the same time I'd like to start thinking in advance about the matter because I'm considering taking some extra classes (in mathematics) as a non-degree seeking student if I decide not to stick with this in order to increase my chances at getting at a good program elsewhere.

I'm picturing a weekly stickied thread linking to a github post of an iPython notebook, a blog post, or even a self post if you can get the message across.

/u/weodude has expressed interest in doing this, so I will voluntell him that he is responsible for the inaugural Question of the Week post.  I was hoping to do these every Monday, so /u/weodude, how does aiming for the 24th of July sound?

If you are interested in answering a question of the week, I might start a google doc listing the schedule.

**Simple Questions**

At times, the sub is flooded with similar questions about Master's programs, transitioning into the field, and other smaller problems. I want to encourage these questions to be asked, but I don't want to flood the feed with the same question over and over.  

On Wednesdays, a new post will be stickied for Simple questions.  If you have a question about:

* Programs

* Education

* Tools

* Careers

* Etc

Please ask them there.  

All of this is tentative, so if you have any issues, recommendations, questions, please let me know.  This is all an attempt to make the community better for you guys, so your opinion is important to the mod team.

Its online and *only* costs $10,000, which seems like a pretty good deal. The downside is that it's relatively new, but from people in the field how useful does it seem?

I currently work in the environmental science/hydrology field, but do a decent amount of work in Python/R/GIS/VBA (especially GIS + R) and have a solid background in stats. I have a BS and an MS in water resources + GIS certificate (not engineering degrees...).

I'm not an engineer and because of this feel that I may have trouble advancing further in my current position. I certainly **need** to brush up on my calculus skills, but I was wondering if this program would be attractive for getting started in data analytics/eventually as a data scientist. I was thinking I could apply the knowledge from this program to my current expertise in the water/environmental field, which are [exploding with new data availability](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Energy-and-Resources/gx-er-water-tight.pdf) (LiDAR, sensors, satellite imagery, etc.). I'd also be open to striking out into a totally new field however.

Im about to start a DS fellowship-type program in the Fall with a goal of getting hired around October-December, so I have this summer to get as far as possible before my program starts.

Along with working on projects, I wanted to understand the models better beyond simply running them in Python, etc. I have two textbooks, [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), and Ive read a couple of chapters into both.

My question: Ive mainly heard professionals recommend reading ISL, but had some also mention ESL. I have the quantitative background to understand ESL, but the material is slower to read, and the problems are difficult. I enjoy reading the book and working through the exercises, but the main issue is that it takes time - plus, I still am aiming to build some projects and/or a blog, so its not the only thing Ill be doing.

Is it worth the time to work through ESL, or should I stick to reading ISL? Im thinking mostly in terms of entering the Data Science field with a preferred focus on ML, but am also looking longer term beyond entry level (should I even be, at this point?).",7,2

To that end, I wanted to present my view of the subreddit going forward, and how that will inform our moderation decisions in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is the purpose of having a Data Science subreddit?**

The primary purpose of having a Data Science subreddit is to provide a place for DS practitioners (both amateur and professional) to discuss and debate topics relating to the field/industry.

&amp;nbsp;

**What kinds of posts should we have in r/datascience?**

* General Data Science Community/News discussion
* Great examples of DS, given in a context that helps educate and inform
* Industry/Career questions and advice (absolute beginners would be directed to the wiki)
* Perspectives of DS community, including open questions, critical comments, and AMAs
* Networking of DS professionals
* Fun DS trivia and ephemera
* Posts about non-commercial tools/platforms/courses, given context
* Posts about commercial tools/platforms/courses, with approval, if setup correctly for discussion rather than advertising

*Note that the above list will likely inform future link flair categories.*

&amp;nbsp;

**How does r/datascience differ from similar subreddits?**

* r/MachineLearning
* r/deeplearning

These subreddits are more focused on the academic, theoretical side of machine learning. Our subreddit should be focused more on the industrial, applied side of machine learning, statistics, and other methods. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't have posts discussing new research or results, but any academic/research material should have broad interest to DS practitioners and be placed in a proper context. Simply posting a link to a paper or blog discussing a novel technique (or even an old one) should not be accepted, and instead directed to r/MachineLearning. Users who want to discuss such things in the subreddit should post a text post that lays out what the paper is and how they are thinking about using it in their DS work.

&amp;nbsp;

* r/statistics
* r/AskStatistics
* r/rstats
* r/pystats
* r/MLQuestions
* r/learnmachinelearning

These subreddits are mostly for asking questions and providing help for specific techniques in statistics, machine learning, R, or Python. Our subreddit can provide limited help in these areas, but shouldn't accept questions that aren't generalized to the context of a Data Science problem/project. In other words, specific discussions about how to optimize k-means should be directed to the appropriate subreddit, but discussions about whether to cluster market segments using k-means would be acceptible (assuming contextual details were included).

&amp;nbsp;

* r/DataHoarder
* r/datasets
* r/opendata
* r/visualization
* r/dataisbeautiful

These subreddits are focused specifically on data/visualizations, which while important to data scientists, are only a means to an end for us. These types of posts should be handled like with r/MachineLearning, where material should have broad interest to DS practitioners and be placed in a proper context. Simply posting a link to a fun dataset or visualization without context should not be accepted.",6,67

1. Is there such thing as age discrimination? This can be a big problem for those working in software development. Older applicants are expected to move to a management role.

2. Do data scientists/analytics typically work 40/hr work weeks? Software developers may be expected to work 40+hrs/week depending on the company.

3. Do you usually work in teams or individually?

4. How often do you have to attend meetings?

5. How do companies measure performance?

6. Are tools/modules constantly when working with data? From the research I've seen so far, some of the standard tools I see mentioned a lot are. 
	NumPy
	matplotlib
	pandas
	SciPy
	sklearn
	Hadoop
	SQL/NoSQL

299,2017-7-18,2017,7,18,12,6nyang,Invest More beyond Tools to Improve Reporting Performance,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6nyang/invest_more_beyond_tools_to_improve_reporting/,Aprilbird,1500349422,"As a type of front-end data service intended for end-users, reports in applications have received a lot of concerns about their performances.  Its all users wish that parameters in and query and aggregate results out in no time. Though less than twenty seconds waiting time is within a tolerant range, three to five minutes will threaten to extend beyond a users patience with the worst product experience. 
But why is a report so slow? And how shall we optimize its performance?

Data preparation 
Usually a report in an application is developed with a reporting tool. Each time when the reporting process is slow, users tend to point their fingers at report developers or reporting tool vendors. In fact, in most cases slowness is a symptom, the real disease lies in the data preparation stage. This means data handling is already slow before the reporting stage. So its no use to simply optimize the report development or to push the reporting tool too hard. 
Reports are for viewing. Since the ability of our naked eye is very limited, theres no need to let a report present a large amount of data. The descriptive computing mode the reporting tool adopts, though intuitive, is not suitable for complex computations. Its inappropriate and pushy to let a reporting tool deal with big data computing and complex computations. Reporting tools are only good at handling the arrangement for small data sets, and simple computations. It takes not long to get them done. 
About 80% of slownesses in reporting are caused by terrible data preparation. Though a report presents only a very small amount of data, the original data for generating it could be in huge amount. It takes very long to filter and aggregate a massive volume of data to get just a small volume. A similar thing happens with a complex computation, for which the most time-consuming job is the data preparation. So data preparation is the bottleneck in trying to facilitate the report building. Ways to optimize the data preparation process are:
1. Optimizing data preparation code. Generally it is SQL code or stored procedure code to optimize. Sometimes it is the application code (when involving non-database data sources or multiple databases). 
2. Scaling up/out the database. We can also scale up/out the database, like clustering, if there is a huge amount of data and there is nothing more for code optimization to do.
3. Employing a high-performance computing engine. We can replace traditional databases that are poor in performance or costly for certain operations with a better computing mechanism.

Report presentation stage
The computational performance problem might also happen during report presentation stage. 
A typical scenario is building a multi-source report, for which joining and aligning multiple two-dimensional data sets by the primary key, and sometimes grouping and aggregation, are needed. As the reporting tool requires that all calculations be written in the cells, the relationship between a cell and other data sets can be only expressed by dataset filtering, such as the formula ds2.select(ID==ds1.ID). The calculation has quadratic complexity. This has little impact on performance when the data amount is very small, but has serious effect if there is a bigger amount of data (say, thousands of rows) and a lot of data sets. The time it takes in performing the calculation could range from seconds to dozens of minutes. 
But the time can be significantly reduced if the calculations are handled during data preparation stage outside of the reporting tool. With data sets coming from a same database, we just write the SQL JOIN statement; if data sets come from different databases or we want to save the database from high computational pressure, we can use the HASH JOIN algorithm outside of the database. The HASH JOIN algorithm treats multiple databases as a whole and brings a much higher efficiency than the filtering join used by the reporting tool does. It achieves an almost instant response for a several-thousand-row data set. 
On the surface, the poor performance is a report-presentation-stage issue, but its solution is often found beyond the reporting tool. 
Another scenario is a grouped and aggregated report with detail rows. Its problem is the slow computation caused by the handling of a big amount of data during the report presentation stage. The solution is the same  moving the data computing out of the reporting tool. 

Data transmission
Data transmission is another bottleneck of the reporting performance.
Currently, many applications are J2EE-based, reporting tools are developed in Java, and JDBC is used for database access. The problem is that, since the performance of some popular databases JDBC is bad (well omit the brands here), it takes fairly long for users to retrieve data even in a slightly large amount (tens of thousands of rows). Heres a paradox: database has a light pressure and delivers quick computations, and report tool handles a relatively simple computation, yet the overall reporting process is still slow. 
Neither application vendors nor reporting tool vendors are capable of improving the database JDBC performance. What they can do is thinking of ways from outside. According to tests, data retrieval performance can be increased by several times using the multithreaded processing (a precondition is a light-loaded database). No reporting tools, however, have ever provided the parallel retrieval functionality directly (Its difficult to make it a reporting tool function because the data segmentation plan varies with database products as well as data retrieval syntax, and thus needs to be controlled by code). Still, the solution is implementing the parallel retrieval during data preparation stage beyond the reporting tool. 

Controllable Cache
If we can cache the results of recent computations for generating a report, then when other users perform queries using the same parameters, there will be no need to re-compute the data and they can just return the results. Obviously this will enhance user experience. This kind of cache functionality is offered by many reporting tools, but not for intermediate results. Only the final result of the computations for generating a report can be cached, and different reports have separated and unconnected caches.
1. Partial caching. For certain types of reports, particularly the commonly seen multi-source reports, most of the involved original data is static (historical data) and only a small part is dynamic (current data). The lifetime of the whole-report cache data is measured by the shortest data history, which results in repeated computations. To cache a part of the data can extend its term of cache validity, and thus reducing the amount of computations. 
2. Reusability of caches. Different reports may reference the same data. But a fragmented cache mechanism for reporting will result in replicated computations over same data. If a cached computational result can be made available across all reports, the amount of computations may be considerably reduced.
Controlling cache is complicated and requires coding. Its difficult to provide such a function within a reporting tool, but its relatively easy to implement it during the programmable data preparation process.

List reports
As previously mentioned, the relationship between reporting and big data isnt as strong as many reporting tool vendors advertising big data report claim it to be. 
Theres indeed a type of list reports that can be called big data reports. A list report, which lists transaction details in a certain period of time, is frequently seen in financial sector. It features a huge amount of data across thousands of, even ten thousand, pages. The computations, however, is relatively simple, listing data, for most of the time, or summarization by groups or pages at most.
Generally reporting tools adopt a full memory storage strategy in order to manage inter-cell computations flexibly. It is very likely that the strategy will lead to memory overflow when loading a big list into the reporting tool. Besides, it takes intolerably long to retrieve and load the list.
Its easy to think about a way of presenting data while retrieving, page by page, causing no danger of memory overflow and reducing the time users have to wait. All databases provide cursors to retrieve data out part by part. Users may flip pages on the front-end, which demands the ability of retrieving data out by random page number (i.e. by rows), but databases dont offer the kind of API for doing so. Retrieving data with conditional filtering not only is quite slow, but cant ensure data consistency.
Theres no better way than to get it done during the data preparation stage. We can devise two asynchronous threads: one for retrieving data from the database and buffer it to the external storage (suppose theres too much data for the memory); and the other for receiving a front-end request and loading data from buffer by random page number (i.e. by rows) to return.

With a linear SVM on a (small) balanced class dataset I'm getting 80% accuracy. 

I balanced the classes by upsampling the minority class (120 texts) to match the majority class (180). Without doing so the SVM naively always predicted the majority class. A Bernoulli Nave Bayes predictor also increases my accuracy in the same manner. 

As I increase the folds of a k-folds cross validation my accuracy increases. This seems like some kind of future leakage perhaps? 

For instance: 

At k=3, accuracy = 78%

k=5, accuracy = 81%

k=10, accuracy = 85%

k=20, accuracy = 91%

I am majoring in computational modeling and data analytics with a 3.6 GPA (3.9 in major). This is a new major at my school and covers a lot of machine learning, data visualization, data collection and web scraping, calc, stats, experimental design, linear algebra, and mathematical modeling. We used R, python, and MATLAB mostly. 

The past two summers I have interned as a data analyst where I mostly created excel report, used SQL for analysis, and did some ad hoc analysis. No big data tools or statistical modeling. The coolest thing I did was create a web scraper to mine some data. The department I'm in (operations) is focused just on making sure the business is functioning and not so much about predictive models or real statistics. The company isn't mindful of data science despite having tons of data.  

My question is now what? I've considered working here full time but I feel bored messing around in excel all day. I miss implementing machine learning and creating predictive models. Unfortunately, most data science jobs I've browsed want a masters degree at the least.

 I've also looked into some data science master programs such as NC state, USC, and UVA. I'd love to attend one of these programs but I'm worried about future employment (since they're newer programs), how I'll pay for it, and if I'd be able to get in. Most of the data science programs are less than a year but upwards of $50k. Does anyone who has attended one of these programs know if I would be able to work as a TA or something?

Should I start with just deep diving into a dataset and trying to analyze it in as many ways as possible? Any good resources for learning the different analysis techniques?

So let me preface my questions by saying I am not looking for answers to these questions. I would like the solve them on my own or programmatically. These pertain towards the hackathon that the NBA is hosting in NYC for university students.

**Basketball Analytics Questions:**

After the Golden State Warriors acquired former MVP Kevin Durant in 2016, some NBA fans speculated that the Warriors would not lose consecutive games at any point of the season.*

a) If you wanted to determine the probability that this prediction would be true (i.e., that the Warriors would never lose consecutive games at any point during an 82-game season), what is one approach (or a few approaches) you may use to solve the problem? What answer do you get? Exact answers are of course welcome, but approaches that lead to approximations (and those approximations) are fine, too (please specify the precision of your estimate). Assume the Warriors have an 80% chance of winning each and every game.

b) So, would you have agreed with that hypothesis?

c) Finally, at least what % of a team's games would a team need to be expected to win (assuming that win probability stays constant from game to game) for there to be a greater than 50% chance that the team never suffers consecutive losses at any point in the season?

**Bonus Question**:When are teams eliminated from playoff contention? Using the results for the 2016-17 regular season as a test case for your quantitative solution, please generate the date that each team was eliminated from playoff contention. We are purely looking for a date when a team was eliminated from playoff consideration, not any specific seed. 

**Business Analytics Questions:**

A term in an NBA team's lease agreement states that it must pay a penalty fee every time it fails to reach 17,000 attendees in three consecutive home games. The onerous fee has caused the team to request assistance in assessing its risk. The team estimates the probability it will reach 17,000 attendees in a home game is 75%, and each game has an equal likelihood of eclipsing the 17,000 threshold.*
a) Given the 75% likelihood of hitting that number each game, what are the odds that the team will avoid a three-game streak with attendance under 17,000 for the entire season? Please build a simple simulator to determine your answer. (Note that there are 41 regular season home games; assume each game is independent.)

b) The team has the option of pursuing an aggressive comp ticket strategy that can increase its odds of hitting the 17,000-attendee mark in every game. Suppose it wants to have a 90% chance of avoiding paying any penalty fees throughout the entire season. Assume the probability, p, of eclipsing 17,000 attendees is the same for every home game - and each game is independent. What probability p should it target in order to achieve a 90% chance to avoid paying any fees?

**TL:DR**: So it's been a while since I've covered stats or data intensive computing problems. But I've learned regression techniques, clustering techniques, and classification techniques in these courses. What types of techniques or other stats techniques would you and should you apply to each of these problems and why?

I am currently working on a project to forecast hourly electricity usage. We have variables of Actual Hourly usage data as the dependent variable and temperature, temperature squared, lagged usage by 24, 48, and 72 hours, wind speed, precipitation, dew point, cloud cover, and relative humidity as possible independent variables.

I will be doing time series regression to create an equation for hourly usage forecasts for the entire year of 2016. Data is available from 2013 until present.

The question that I hope I could get some input on is what variables should I detrend and how?

I've detrended the dependent variable using weighted averaging over seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly effects. Is differencing a better option for this variable? Or maybe another detrending technique?

My real concern though is whether or not to detrend the temperature to remove the seasonal term. However, I know temperature is a big driver of electricity usage and I'm unsure if taking the seasonal trend out would be beneficial to the model. 

An overall encompassment - what would you suggest to do on the basis of detrending before running some time series regression analysis?

I am doing a market segmentation for an insurance firm and I am struggling with what time interval to use for financial data.

I've read in books that taking data for up to half a year back is enough for most segmentations. However, the hard part of the insurance industry is that not all customers pay at the same time (monthly, quarterly, annually). Therefore, picking data from half a year back will introduce a bias in the customer's behavior. 

With this in mind, I was thinking of taking the accumulated financial information of 2016 and change my segmentation to the customers who made payments in 2016.

Let me know what you think!

I have a question: say we have a larger number of texts (tweets for example) from a single author. We are then given a new, unlabeled text (we don't know who authored it). Is there a standard way to get a probability estimate of whether or not the new unlabeled text was likely written by that author?

I've seen examples where if you have labeled datasets from multiple authors, you can train a classifier to predict which text belongs to which author, but never if an unknown text belongs to the single person in question.

I assume this would be some kind of anomaly detection? Thanks!",1,2

I've been discussing with my friend about how full stack is defined in different software development subindustries. I.e. in web you'd probably would have to know front-end and backend (CSS, JS and some sort of server side programming language) whereas mobile full stack would refer to knowing Android/iOS (sorry WP), REST APIs and server side programming.

Data analyst takes data from a data set and cleanses/munges/transforms it to a usable form and makes an analysis using visualization tools. 
Data Scientist does all of the above + makes models to predict the next thing that will happen

I have read a lot that Machine Learning is involved in this, but where? 

Also, the Data Analysis part seems really simple. Ive seen a hack competition by an analytics company online and all we had to was the following:
-Use pandas numpy matplotlib in python
-We were given a dataset on Loan Approvals
-Made some histograms/box plots to see what actually induces a real change in the approval of loan
-Cleaned some data with null values
-Found out that most of the time Loan approvals are based on Graduate status for females and Salary for males. 

Is this really it? Idk if this seems easy to me because I like doing it or whatever I did was not actually data analysis? 

Im doing an undergrad im CS and the coding involved in the hack seemed very basic, I felt like all the functions I need could be written on a cheat sheet and I can use that to make my everyday analysis.

I have a week left to submit a project idea for an Msc in Data Science. I work in clinical data research and believe it or not am struggling to come up with something. We hold a large data warehouse of many clinical datasets, all different and mostly all complicated with patchy, incomplete data, nonsense data, etc. We extract and provide this data to facilitate clinical research and have complicated processes to go through in order to do this. Everything I have come up with recently (metadata automation, project summary characteristic generation &amp; automation, dashboards, etc.) has been rendered pointless by the recent buy-in (this week) of a system designed by another, parallel department, to my department! 

So my other ideas were: 

1. the creation and automated update of a cohort from the local population which is representative of the country as a whole, in order for statistical comparison when research projects are done. Or,

2. automated checking of output files for disclosure, data not being escaped, etc.

If there any other ideas out there which you think might fit, feel free to suggest them, I would really appreciate any pointers at this stage. I'm starting to go into panic mode!

I currently hold a M.Ed in Curriculum and Instruction. I'm looking at programs at the graduate certificate level, supplemented with MOOCs.

Data science certificates I see have more programming courses, database architecture, and machine learning; things I'm more unfamiliar with. R, Python, etc.

So, lots of benefits to R!

But, I am curious. Is R used in production environments? By that, I mean as part of the business layer in large scale online web applications and web sites. Or, is R more the domain of research scientists?

407,2017-7-23,2017,7,23,14,6ozs0v,I recently successfully interviewed for a Data Scientist position. Here is some information on the interview and how I think I landed the job.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6ozs0v/i_recently_successfully_interviewed_for_a_data/,__compactsupport__,1500788367,"**Phone Screening**

I was asked some very basic questions: If I had any experience with modelling, any experience with Python or R, and why I was looking for a new job.  I think so long as you answer these questions in the affirmative, then you will be fine.  The most important part is to come off as likeable. Make a joke, seem like a human.  After all, they want someone they will like to work with.

**Interview 1**

This was an interview with an HR manager and the successful candidate's manager.  Here are some questions I was asked:

&gt;Why did you leave your last job.

Be honest.  I said I wasn't being challenged and that I wasn't valued (which was the truth).  This is also a great segue into seeing if this position is different.  

&gt;If you could spend 5 hours getting your model to 90% accuracy, and another 5 getting it to 95% accuracy, would you?

This is a tough question and is probably designed to see if you get the business perspective of data science.  The right answer (to me) is ""it depends on how much that 5% is worth"".  If additional accuracy means hundreds of thousands of more dollars, you bet your ass I am going to  squeeze every ounce of accuracy out of it.  



&gt;Tell me your experience with productionalization

I literally have 0 experience productionalizing.  Not everyone is well equipped with every skill set.

**Interview 2**

They gave me a take home regression problem.  The question asked me to report some simple regression metrics.  I used the opportunity to showcase my scientific ability as well as tell a story.  Don't be afraid to show your model's weakness.  They probably aren't looking for you to be perfect.

There were a couple of soft skill questions from HR that don't generalize well, but that was mostly it.

**Questions I asked**

&gt;Can I contribute to open source?

With some places *AHEM BANKS AHEM AHEM* whatever you create is owned by them.  Now, I don't plan to put our company's library on CRAN, but if I create a library to solve a specific problem, I would feel like I am obligated to share it with the community

&gt;What is the difference between data science and statistics?

People don't fucking know what they want a data scientist for.  They don't even know what a data scientist does.  I just want to see that they have thought out what the role is for and how it will effect the business.

&gt;What does success look like in the role?

Just to set my expectations

&gt;I am worried that I will not fit in because my personality is geared towards research rather than corporate culture.  Do you think that will be a problem?

The one thing I hate is ""business as usual"", mostly because I don't fit that very well.  If you have concerns, you should let that be known.  The HR manager was very glad I brought it up.  If they like you, they want to make sure you like them too.

A day later, I got the offer.  I plan on taking it, and soon I'll be a lead data scientist :)",56,163

For the past year I have been working for an IT solutions firm, that provides IT-business solutions to large and small scale clients. I have been mainly reporting and building dashboards on Qlik tools, primarily Qlik Sense.

Here comes a couple of questions, but before that I'll tell you:


What I know:

In this job, I do enjoy understanding the business issues, reading about and understanding the industry, understanding the company's workflow, and the questions they want answered. But all of that usually entails building a data model and presenting what can be derived from their data onto a dashboard to give them their figures. It does not for the most part pose a challenge and neither does this sort of job put me in the position of advising the business as to what decisions they could make to potentially solve their issues and improve their current standing. I am merely reporting what I can see from their data.

Which is the part that I do not enjoy so much. So I was thinking of switching up.

From what I understand about the business analytics spectrum, the next stage of business analytics, after dashboarding, is predictive modelling. Which i enjoyed being a part of in one of my projects, this part was handled by a different team but due to my curiosity I was in on every step of the way.

So far I had been working on business intelligence, but this part deals with data science along with business analytics. I'm going to call this business analytics from now on.


What I believe:

I believe since ML and predictive modelling in R and Python don't really give a very presentable picture, there must be some tools or software that these are used in conjunction with in the actual industry to study the insights given by these methods. Maybe Qlik sense or other such BI tools.

Is that really so?

If not, then, what do, say, retail stores or FMCG companies, that utilize such models to predict how much stock they need for the 4th of July sale use to report, understand and drive business decisions.


What I don't know:

I recently completed a course on inferential statistics in order to get started with machine learning. Next step in my view would be starting any of the machine learning courses online, accompanied by learning R/Python.

Please tell me if I am on the right track with my pursuit of business analytics and machine learning.

Another question that I have is what sort of profiles exist in the market regarding this kind of business analytics, like financial analyst, retail, consulting etc.

There are further research oriented jobs in this field, if we leave out business analytics from ML, but I think that would require a higher degree in those fields, which I may be considering. What sort of jobs will I be looking at if I pursue an MS in data science?


Sorry for the wall of text. I have a few more questions but I think this much is enough for now. I'll followup if someone replies to this post.

I have spend last several weeks working on a project which could not only be added to my portfolio, but also give me some practical skills and a story to tell.

Here is the [link](https://digits-draw-recognize.herokuapp.com/).

This is a little site (also working on mobile), where a user can draw a digit and machine learning models will try to recognize it. There are two models: FNN written on numpy and CNN on Tensorflow. Both were inspired by cs231n. But models don't simply recognize the images, they are also trained on new images to improve their accuracy.

I collected the data by myself - I drew 1000 images, ~100 of each digit. Then I created the models and trained them on this data. This was my first experience in:

* Collecting, processing and storing the data by myself;
* Building a site and using Flask;
* Buidling models, which can be trained on additional data;
* Working with Amazon cloud;
* Augmenting images;
* Building new good TF structure for my purpose;

I have described the models and the project workflow on site, you can find the links in the navigation bar at the top.

1) Oracle SQL  

- basic ddl and dml
- database architecture basics
- regex patterns
- functions in Oracle SQL
- SQL tuning

2) Python

(suggestions needed here)

- basics of Python
- Packages like numpy, matplotlib etc.

3) No SQL DBA

- Cassandra: csh and CQL(my employer is about to start a training in this)

4) Statistics

(Suggestions needed here)

- Stanford or UTaustin's Statistics course from websites like edx, Coursera etc.

5) R programming

 - Already completed a udemy course on this.

- Need to start another udemy course on this to improve the depth of knowledge.

6) Machine learning basics

Udemy course by Kirill eremenko

My initial thoughts were that a stronger foundation in math, stats, and how to design and run experiments would've been the better choice to actually be able to apply data science and machine learning to problems, while actually learning the tech on the side/on the job if possible. But now I find myself jumping back and forth now between doing that or vice versa, i.e. getting the online masters in CS from Georgia Tech while doing more stats on the side (also while doing mini-projects in any free time I have no matter the scenario). I read somewhere in my search that getting a stats degree online is a lot of teaching yourself anyway, so I'm unsure if it's worth it now, 

All 3 programs interest me, but as of right now I believe a career towards more machine learning engineering and possibly AI is what I'd like to do, which both stats programs really don't go into much past ""Statistical Learning and Data Mining"", which is why the electives at GT jumped out at me, but I'm just second-guessing if I'd be a bit lost without the statistical foundations for those courses.

I know this question has been asked multiple times here, but I'm just looking some advice to get me out of paralysis-by-analysis.

EDIT: I think another viable option may be the Applied Statistics Graduate Certificate from Penn State to test the waters and *then* move onto GT or continue on with Applied Stats",3,6

That might have been nave, but my time in this job (11 months) hasnt been fruitful in helping create that foundation. I started my Information Technology degree in the spring and will be done in early 2019. I absolutely do not want to be in HR for the rest of my life; I am more technologically inclined and struggle with how technology adverse most HR professionals are. My question is, can I land a Data Analyst position as-is and learn on the job, if not, is there a job below Data Analyst that I can get, that has a path to Data Analyst? I will be working on my SQL skills and implementing Workday HCM/Workday Analytics over the next 9 months, but with school, I wont be able to learn R or Python in the meantime.

4 years in HRIS
Some SQL
Experience with Microstrategy Web and Desktop
Created Data Dictionary
Expert Reporter using Relational Database
Understanding of ETL and its purpose
Understanding of Database Structure
Experience with HR Analytics like turnover and mobility

My question is, if I desire to be more of the analytical Data Scientist, what concepts of Computer Science should I be familiar with at the bare minimum? For example, is a class in Data Structures and Algorithms (taught in C) useful&gt; Or should I focus on other statistical and/or machine learning courses?

I work for a rather large nonprofit organization, and I am working to build internal change and make everyone more 'data driven' in their projects.  Many of our employees are older and perhaps not very tech literate, and many of our offices are in developing countries where the technology resources are not very new (ex: the whole office is setup on 10 year old PCs and use basic Excel sheets to run everything; its not like everyone has flashy new macbooks and playing around in Tableau all day).

I'm looking for resources, especially online videos, to help teach people basic data literacy skills.  I'm looking for two things:

**Short Teaser Videos:**  For example, TED talks about data, such as Hans Rosling's great material.  For another example, a 5 minute YouTube video that explains commons sources of Big Data in today's world.  Etc.  Less than 15 minutes, and easy to digest for non-techy people.

**Medium Length Overview Courses, cheap or free:**  For example, our employees don't need to learn Python, but it would be great for them to maybe do a few Khan Academy courses and refresh basic statistics ideas, or have them understand how to use Pivot Tables in Excel, or have them learn some basics about using Data Visualization persuasively in powerpoints.  That kind of thing, perhaps courses that are &lt;20 hours in length, and &lt;$50 to do.

If you have any suggestions for materials that I can compile, I would really appreciate it!  I strongly believe that making our employees more data driven and data literate can have a real, meaningful impact in our programs, and I will take any help I can get :)",6,18

Over 20 years of this data [is freely available through The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/downloadable-public-use-files/cost-reports/); however, this data is presented in two multi-hundred MB CSV files for each year of data.

Currently I'm doing my masters in geographic information systems where I've learned to program in python and SQL (which I feel confortable), as well as use R, SSRS to create and analyse data warehouses. 
In my free time I'm learning how to apply and analyse ML algorithms and getting deeper knowledge into DS (both from udemy courses).

What I wanted to ask is if, in your opinion, what I'm learning is enough to apply to a job in analytics (for a start) and being able to compete with people with a more specialized bachelors / masters!

I won't bother you with why I'm asking this unless you guys think it's relevant and if someone wants to give me advice / some help (private or not) it would be greatly welcome!

I have roughly 1500 cases of forecasts by a weather model (a lot of parameters ~ 400) with the respective ""solution"" (the measurements). I turned this into a classification forecast by assigning wind gusts &lt;= 25 knots to class ""0"" and the others to class ""1"" because it has tradition to just report wind gusts above 25 knots in meteorological ground measurements.

My current thoughts are:

- using a very easy algorithm like a perceptron as a comparison

- using some totally different algorithms for skill comparison

-- Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, maybe also some kind of neural network

-- tuning some parameters of these algorithms with cross-validation (or out of bag samples in random forests)

- answering some interesting questions:

-- does the forecast skill get significantly worse when the classification boundary is increased (25 knots -&gt; 30/40 knots) due to less cases?

-- does the forecast skill improve when cases of non-nearby other stations are added? (non-nearby to decrease correlation between the cases)

-- how about combining the forecasts of the tested algorithms? does this yield an even better forecast?


I would really appreciate any suggestions and thoughts.",1,2

I have a digital marketing agency. I am want to learn data science to improve my business and offer more services for my clients.

For the last 2 months I have been search, studying, watching videos, reading blogs and everything you can think about data science. That subject makes me really excited and I am sure that's what I want to learn know.

I have a huge digital marketing knowledge as well as html/css/js (web development). I am use to analyze marketing data but nothing close to what you guys do with algorithm and everything.

I need to start to learn data science but I don't know how exactly. I found many ways to learn and I would like some suggestions about what would be the best.

I love to learn new things by myself and I learn really fast.

**So what would you guys recommend?**

* **MS Data Science** - I am not considering that much this option because its expensive and will take a huge amount of time. However if you tell me that will be really important (what I doubt) I might consider.

* **Online Courses (Udemy/Udacity/Coursera)** - I really like nanodegree's Udacity proposal however I have heard that they are not that good or there are better out there. 

What you have to say about it?

* **Book/e-Book/Videos** - I feel that I learn more hands-on and not too much listening or watching something. However I would like some recommendations about beginner books that could be useful to a better understanding and read before go to sleep. 

* **Datacamp** - They are a platform focused on data science. Are they good? Would I be able to learn everything I need to know there?

I am reading Data science for business from Tom Fawcett. It's really good, with easy language and I feel I am learning a lot but not as much as I would doing things by myself.

That's it. I am more excited with online courses like Udacity but I am not sure.

What would you suggest to me? 
What is the best way to learn data science online? 
What should I learn first?
For someone with my background what would be the best learning plan?

Thank you guys. I appreciate it.",9,0

Check out our new tool, [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.io/), that allows users to virtually explore cities and find sidewalk problems, and help us make cities more accessible!

---
Sidewalks benefit all of us. They help improve walkability, increase physical activity, and provide a safe, accessible path for people with disabilities. However, there is a severe lack of information about the location and quality of sidewalks in cities. Our research team at the University of Maryland is trying to change this. **And we need your help**.

[Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.io/) is a new online tool that enables anyonefrom motivated citizens to government workersto virtually walk through cities to locate, label, and assess sidewalk accessibility. Since our beta launch in Fall 2016, over 600 users have contributed **76,000 labels** across 532 miles of DC streetsthats nearly **50% of the city** (and more than the distance from DC to Detroit).

User-contributed labels are used to develop new accessibility-friendly mapping tools (e.g., route planners, map visualizations), to train machine learning algorithms to semi-automatically assess cities in the future, and to create better transparency about city accessibility (imagine a [WalkScore](http://www.walkscore.com/) for sidewalk accessibility!). And all of our [data](http://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu/api) and [source code](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage) is **completely open**, so it's easy for you to build your own applications or perform your own analyses with our data. See: [http://projectsidewalk.io/api](http://projectsidewalk.io/api) for details.

But we are not done. Our goal is **100%** DC coverage and then to expand to five more cities by the end of 2017. To help us get there, we are proud to announce a **new version** of [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.io/) that makes it easier and faster to explore DC neighborhoods and find sidewalk problems! Try it out today by visiting [http://projectsidewalk.io](http://projectsidewalk.io/). Even five minutes of your day could help make someone elses. 

You can also help out by sharing this message with your colleagues, family, and friends and by [retweeting this tweet](https://twitter.com/projsidewalk/status/888040060163162117)!

I've developed an interest in data science but  I need some guidance. I know that you guys see these threads a lot, but I assure you that my situation is somewhat uncommon.

My situation: I have an undergrad Stats background. I was admitted to a PhD program in Biostatistics in a strong school, which I will start this fall. I only recently learned about data science, several months after I accepted my offer of admission. I do not want to leave my program because having a PhD really helps a statistician in biotechnology, and at the moment I'm still very interested in that field.



1) Suppose that I earn my MS and decide that I want to pursue a career in Data Science. Assuming that I have done due diligence by then and honed my Data Science skills (coursera, Kaggle, github and other self-learning), is it better to continue to my PhD if I also enjoy my research, or would it be better to stop and get a DS job? I've read varying opinions (pros and cons) on the worth of a PhD for a data science career, but those answers are usually for somebody who is considering applying to a PhD program, not for somebody who was already admitted. Note that continuing to a PhD would give me time to take CS classes in algorithms and machine learning. 



2) What's the best way to just get a feel for whether I like data science, without sacrificing a lot of time or money? When I ask this, I am not referring to long term self-learning. Rather, I just want a free way to ""explore"" data science without paying a considerable sum for a coursera sequence. If I enjoy data science based on this, I would then proceed to more in-depth self-learning that would involve coursera, github projects, etcetra.",8,0

Physics research is cool, and I wouldn't kill myself if I had to do it for the rest of my life, but I'm also not *super* into it.

So I've been looking into other options, and one of them is data science. I've done a pretty decent amount of coding in grad school, and maybe even a tiny amount of what could be considered DS. No ML though, and I've been using a somewhat obscure language, so I really would have to teach myself a decent amount before making any moves. However, I think I could do it fairly easily -- I have a strong math background from the phd and a math undergrad, and I can pick up languages fairly quickly, having had to pick up various ones over the years.

I have a couple questions though, if anyone could help me.

1) For people who went into DS from a research background, is it satisfying? I've read stuff about DS work and it seems like it can range from soulless stuff to pretty interesting, important stuff, but I really don't know what the distribution is. For example, I'm not sure how I'd feel about something like figuring out how to increase sales for a company. Are you glad you switched from science research?

2) I like the idea of not being tied down to one specific location, so I'm looking into work I could do remotely on a computer. Do any of you work remotely? Is it common in DS? Or would I really need to spend at least a few years building connections and working in person?

3) I've read a few threads around here about bootcamps and their efficiency/worth and opinion seems somewhat divided. But for my specific background, does anyone have advice? For example, I saw one thread say that phd's might be better off skipping a bootcamp and trying to get hired directly. What has your experience been?

4) Mostly just curiosity, but do any data scientists work part time somehow?

any advice from a similar background would be really helpful, thank you!",7,11

With the experience I have, I could help different companies to perform some specific or exploratory data analyses, implement data products (dashboards or other) or, at a higher level, help them designing a global data strategy.

My plan is to work remotely and not on site (there is no local demand where I live and do not consider relocation). On my side this is not an issue as I have been working remotely for a while now but some companies prefer to have the person on site. I am located in Europe and can travel occasionally to meet clients. I assume my main target market would be UK and US.

To take the leap, I would need to have a first decent contract of at least 3 to 6 months. What I have to work on now is to develop strategies/channels to get such contracts. The main ideas I have in mind are:

1. Network. Ask around to some persons I already know if they would be interested in using my services. Main drawback is that I can not do this publicly (e.g. shouting it out on my LinkedIn profile) as I do not want my colleagues to realise that I might leave the company soon.

2. Contact recruiters and let them know that I am available for contract work. I would not rely heavily on this but sometimes this could bring me some opportunities in a passive manner.

3. Offer a bounty. Get some friends/acquaintances/people to know that I offer a cut (e.g. 10%) on any lead on a successful contract. Again, at that moment I can not shout it publicly so it might be a better option in the future. (e.g. once I get my first contract and quite my job).

4. Get in touch with some ""freelancer sales representatives"". I have no idea if such persons exist but I would imagine them as independent consultant/salesman who put in contacts companies with freelancers taking a cut on the process.

5. Freelance platforms. Not a big fan of those as I do not expect high quality clients. Higher quality platforms like Toptal could be an option though but it requires quite some effort to get in.

6. Cold calling/emailing companies. Definitely not something I am interested in as I know by experience from other project that it is time consuming and response rate is very low. This is something I could outsource though.

At the moment I do not know where to start because of all the possible solutions (and I want to have a small portfolio online before starting).
From you experience, which of these channels are more successful? Do you think of any other that could work or has worked for you?

Thanks a lot. :)",11,16

I appear to be at a pivotal point in my life where my decisions right now could affect my whole career trajectory. I come to you guys looking for some advice and possibly direction.

I recently graduated with a degree in Applied Stats and have pretty good experience in predictive modeling and exploratory analysis both through my classwork and outside of class. 
[Here](https://www.github.com/Njfritter) is my github if anyone would like to look. Also some published projects on a website some of my buddies made:

[Sentiment Analysis](https://www.inertia7.com/projects/28)

[Building a Data Pipeline with Cloudera](https://www.inertia7.com/projects/28)

I have more projects as well utilizing NLP, data mining, and other predictive modeling techniques. I am proficient with Python and R, decent with SQL and have a little Scala/Spark/Java experience.

I want to get into the Data Science field but not quite sure what path to pursue; it is not straight forward like all of my classes have been. My main questions are:

* With my experience as is, would more projects in predictive modeling and EDA be enough to land me a Data Scientist job (most likely Type A due to lack of software engineering knowledge)?
* If I were to get a Data Scientist job, would I be able to make the transition over to using big data tools w/o an advanced degree? Or should I just prepare for the future with an advanced degree?
* Is there anyway I can pursue projects/complete courses at a CC/MOOC to show enough proficiency in CS w/o getting another Bachelor's or advanced degree in CS? 

I have not had much success applying for jobs as a Data Analyst and Data Scientist, and I want to be as efficient as possible in how I go forward spending my time. An advanced degree in say, Computer Science would open many doors; however I would need to gain alot of knowledge in CS just to get to a point where I would be considered for a graduate program.

I apologize if this post is rather long, I just want to make my experience clear. And if any other posts on this subreddit answer my questions feel free to link it as well. Thank you!

The first in person interview was rough (I thought) and reached the point of a panel of interviewers asking me to go up to the whiteboard and map out an ENTIRE 'master database plan' for a fictitious company including everything from justifying what data I need from the client, how I'll integrate it into our system, what types of databases I'll use in certain situations, ETL processes, data modeling, etc. Then they'd go all Socratic method on me and change one little piece to see how I'd adapt. It was brutal.

They def exposed my weaknesses, but gave me a call back the next morning saying they loved me and wanted to bring me back one last time (with more people there, obviously). Here are my two questions:

1. Usually in final interviews I've brought something physical. A report I made, presentation for a past project, etc. Then I hand out bounded copies and seal the deal. I want to do something similar, but what could I really show? Is there something specific (and tangible) you think I could pass around that would solidify my credibility? 

And 

2. When I first spoke to the recruiter, she asked me what salary I expected. I'll admit I was totally unprepared and hadn't done my research, but it was only a step or so up from where I'm at now, and in the same city. So I felt a little ballsy and asked for the equivalent of a 40% raise. She said that sounded fine and that was it.

However... I checked Glassdoor and the the average pay for that role is literally double what I make now. HOWEVER...I'm assuming most of those associates are people who *actually* met the job description's requirements (5+ years in various realms where I could maybe say I have 6 months). I also met a few of them (same role im applying for) and they're all late-twenties to mid-thirties. I graduated college two years ago, so you can do the math.

So this question has two parts, if I get the offer, is it in bad taste to say ""hey remember that amount I mentioned originally? I'm gunna need more""? And if it's not, then what should I ask for? ",4,1

I am doing this project as a dissertation for my master's in a mortgage bank.

Description:

The bank wants me to do a sensitivity analysis on their portfolio of mortgage accounts.
They already have a simulation (pretty high - level) that simulates their portoflio at the end of each of the next 4 years and outputs capital requirements and their position against their risk appetites.

The inputs of the simulation are their lending plan (how much % of each type of account and how much LTV, redemption rate, probability of default and cure rate to predict Expected losses, HPI, and their desired advances).

What they want from me is to provide them with a framework for testing the portfolio against different economic scenarios and lending plans, playing around with the inputs pretty much.

My approach:
In order to do that, I need to explore the solution space in a systematic way. I am looking into DOE methods to derive solutions at certain levels of each variable.
However,  we have 10 inputs so a full factorial with 3 levels for example is not very feasible (the simulation runs once in 8'').

What are designs I should look for?

Also, the % of LTV must sum up to one, which means that some inputs are dependent on others. How do I deal with that?

Once I have a sample of inputs and their solutions, the plan is to divide it into ""good"" and ""bad"" according to the results (read ""good position against their risk appetites"") and then perform some Smirnov tests to see which values drive good performance, along with correlation analysis between pairs of inputs.

I received many useful comments and a recommendation to try docker....which seems like a solid approach.

Before diving into docker, however, I have perused the possibility of using a scala layer as a possible way to integrate java and r in production using rscala to integrate r and scala (e.g., java web app receives a classification request which is sent through scala to rscala and then  r. In r, ML models are utilized to classify and send a response back to the web app via the scala layer).

I have not yet invested the days it will take to grasp scala (I'm a java programmer not scala) and then rscala. Before embarking on this journey, I am curious whether my proposed framework makes sense.

Or, am I going to hit some major obstacles a few days down the line that will make me regret not just going with docker in the first place?

My background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.

**Architectures**

- Learn how to use Hadoop/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). 

- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.

- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.

**Languages**

- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.

- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.

**Background**

- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.

- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.

- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.

- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.

- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression. You would be amazed how many clients tell me they want to use Deep Learning and have like 500Kb of data.",82,272

I'm a university researcher that's been tasked with sourcing some large markov chain matrices. Something larger than say 80x80, preferably MUCH larger. 

I've looked around and can't really find anything that fits the bill, except some mentions of sets in the medical field that I don't think I can access. I don't really care WHAT subject the data comes out of, as we're just looking to use it for validation of a methodology, only that the set itself contains many elements (and that we can access it, obviously). 

Can you guys point me towards any sets/repos of data that may be in this scope?

547,2017-7-29,2017,7,29,3,6q5saw,"am I doing something wrong here? (xgboost, gridsearchcv)",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6q5saw/am_i_doing_something_wrong_here_xgboost/,dumbdumbdumbdumb5,1501266933,"hi, r/datascience! 

I'll get right to the chase: 

I have a sinking feeling that I'm doing some shoddy data science work, and I was hoping y'all might be able to either a) confirm that what I'm doing is wrong, or b) tell me I'm actually fine. 

I'll try my best to describe the situation -- and my approach -- as clearly as possible, but I recognize this might need some clarification. 

for a bird's eye view: I'm using xgboost and gridsearchcv to identify the best hyperparameters for my model. 

here are the steps I'm performing, in order (step that I think might be inappropriate is bolded): 

* split my dataset into training and testing (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test) 

* pass a variety of hyperparameters and the X_train dataset to GridSearchCV (with cv = 10) 

* identify best estimator determined through GridSearchCV (best_xgbooster) 

* **split my original dataset in train and testing datasets N times, and for each split (X_train_2, X_test_2, etc.) , fit best_xgbooster to the training data and gather the score from the testing sets** 

I feel like this last step might be wrong because inevitably some of X_train (the original) will end up in an X_test_2 dataset, meaning the model I'm generating has 'already seen' the data it's being tested on.  

assuming my concerns are valid, my question is this: 

if we cut out the last step (where the original dataset is split again N times) and simply rely on seeing the results of best_xgbooster on the original X_test and y_test, I'll only have a single value to show at the end of this entire process. 

I'm concerned that this single value might very well be some random fluctuation, and that it will not be representative of the actual robustness of my model. 

is it appropriate to instead perform the *entire* GridSearchCV process over again from the beginning? i.e. split the original dataset into a new X_train, y_train, pass the *same* hyperparameters to GridSearchCV, and use the 'best' model determined via GridSearch to calculate a single value for the new X_test, y_test values? I feel like this will take inordinate amounts of time (given the number of hyperparameters passed, and the overall time it takes for a single xgboosted model to get built), but if that's the case, so be it! 

I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on this, and -- assuming I'm wrong -- some help understanding where I'm going wrong and why. 

thanks!",4,1

My general understanding of neural networks are that you can add and combine multiple hidden layers to create sort of mini classifiers, so that when you put all the layers together you have one really complex classifier. Backpropagation (something I don't yet fully understand) is the algorithm that helps train the neural network and reduce the cost function. Activation functions don't have to always be sigmoids, there can be a variety of different activation functions. Is this the general idea?

I honestly couldn't even guess. Will it take hadoop an hour? 10 hours? 10 days?

Also, I know a lot of effort was put into compressing common crawl data so if I put it into an elastic search database, how much (if any) will the data balloon?

We've 1300 data points for property ""success"" that we're trying to model with a mix of variables and random forest methodology. When we use 90% of the data to train and 10% to validate the model, the best we can do is an Rsquare of .7 with 30 variables, but if I use the whole data set in building the model I can get an RSquare of .97 using only 10 variables. 

My intuition as an amateur is that it's difficult to overfit a model this size when there is only 10 input variables, but there might be something about the random forest methodology that has a tendency to overfitt more than methodology I'm familiar with. 

Our desired output is to have a bellwether for where we should invest future development efforts--we don't need an exact answer.

What would the concerns and risks be with choosing to use the 10 variable model over the 30? Would it be reasonable to average the outputs between the two?",29,4
