They were nothing special but did the job. My question, though, is 'are there any things that would make better/smarter choices for analytical purchases?'

Current plan is just to get vanilla windows laptops (possibly sans graphics cards) to load SAS, SPSS, Excel and some modelling programs onto.

As a sidenote, would there be any advantage in investing in a tower/server as a data cruncher? We normally have sets which are only 6-10m records but these can still take a while to chug through with our current setup.

Thanks.",2,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm also very well versed in Linux and server administration, so please don't hold back.

I've been looking for something easy and lightweight that can spit out quality graphs, charts and tables from an RDBMS and (or) NoSQL (key value) store.  My company is a Splunk partner and I've been pumping data to a demo Splunk instance and I couldn't be happier with its capabilities.  It's lightning fast and creates great visualizations.  The catch is that Splunk charges by amount of data indexed and while it handles JSON like a champ, aggregating and then pushing the data to Splunk proves to be limiting in that my license is limited to 500MB of indexed data per day.

So I ask.  Does anyone know of a lightweight but powerful engine that can query and generate visualizations (and do aggregation/stats) on JDBC/JSON/NoSQL/RDBMS sources?  I don't want to go all out with something like Pentaho's BI suite, looking for something a little less cumbersome to deploy.

TL;DR: looking for something fast and light to pull data and make nice graphs and charts",5,6,False,self,,,,,

I feel like I could learn the programming in perhaps a few months time with my background, and that I may already have the statistics background necessary. Am I wasting my time looking for a data science job? ",8,5,False,self,,,,,
