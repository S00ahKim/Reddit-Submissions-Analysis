I would really love to find a platform that can identify patterns between data and create groups to look at some data similar to their system, but it doesn't seem to be a supported capability by anyone except Ayasdi who built their proprietary software specifically for this. I have experience with JMP, Tableau, and Python but don't know of a TDA functionality in these options.

More over, some systems have more pieces of the hierarchy than others (some CRM systems just have product name).

The goal is to dump a bunch of known affinities at different points in the hierarchy (product line affinity, sku affinity, model affinity, product name affinity) into a pool, semi-normalize that data, and make it searchable.  So a sales guy could search anything he/she knows about and pull affinities.

The core of data science seem to have been around for quite a while: statistical analysis of numerical data, documentation, and communication of findings. So I tried thinking about what might be categorically new about the past couple years of data science practice and came up with a few thoughts about where might differences lie:  
* accessibility of storage and computing power (computers are more ubiquitous, storage and processing power better than ever before);  
* we more can get more data about more things more things than ever before, and about things that didn't exist until recently (tech makes data about practices like transit usage more exact and more easily available, while also creating new realms of data around things like social media use for things like sentiment analysis);  
* emphasis on data deposit, data reuse, and open data (especially in public sector).

What do you think? Is there more to it than that, or are the difference between ""data science"" and ""quantitative research"" overstated?

My question is, how do I learn to create interesting but fundamentally sound data analysis? In terms of level of math, what makes an analysis unbiased, how do I learn to ask the right questions when approaching a data project, etc. I want to be able to do analysis good enough for publications like NYTimes, Bloomberg, etc.

Here are some examples:

I am building a product which logs website visitor information.

I need to be able to look for specific patterns in this visitor data.

For example, let's say there was a sudden spike in visitors tonight from 8 PM - 11 PM.

I want my product to be able to recognise periods when there is a spike in traffic.

I understand I could write some brute force code which does something like counts the number of visitors in every 5 minute period and compares the current value with the previous 5 minute period value, and then compares the previous 5 minute period value with the one before that, and so on for perhaps the previous ten 5 minute periods, and try to judge if traffic is increasing.

But obviously this is a horrible way to achieve this.

Are there any common pattern/trend algorithms or techniques or general best practices for this sort of thing?

Also, what is this area of study called? Is it statistics? If so, is this something I could hire a statistics intern to help with, or is it too advanced?

Sorry if these are stupid questions.

Thanks for your advice.

tldr: What skills do I need/ What's the best way to land a job in data science?

Next week I will finally graduate as a M.Sc. Business Informatics. However, I'm trying to land a job as a data scientist for about a month now without any success. Here in Germany the number of open entry-level positions is quite small since most companies are just setting up their data science departments. 

During my studies I did a specialization in ""Intelligent information systems"" (Data Mining basics, Case-based retrieval, semantic web) and Data Management systems (Digital libraries, Filesystems, Information retrieval). I wrote my thesis about Outlier Detection for semiconductor research (in the industry), but couldn't land a job their because they get funded by public research funds and didn't have a long term project where they needed me. Also I have expert level skills in Python and SQL. 

Do you have any idea, what skills could acquire to boost my employability in the field? Or any portfolio projects I could do to show my capabilties to a potential employer.

We hopefully want to make something good enough to put on our resume for grad school. 

We are both financial economic juniors with computer science minors. 

There is a community board our college provides that is similar to craigslist. People can post items to sell in a bunch of different categories. 

The current working idea is that we web scrape all the prices off the board and create a 'semi-functional' index. We would collect it as a time series data so over time it would look a lot like a stock index. 

Our goal is to both be able to go into computational finance and algorithmic trading so after we build this index we would work on writing an algorithm that could predict the movement of the index.

We would love to hear your thoughts on this experiment. We also have a couple questions. 

    1. What would be the best way to calculate the index 
      ""price"" would we combine all the posts and then average 
       the  price? Or should we make a couple indices such as 
      ""electronics"", ""clothes"", ""misc"" ?
    2. A lot of these posts stay up for multiple days so the 
       index would only be accurate at describing the change 
       in price from the new posts. 

This is our current idea, if you could think of something better we could do, we'd definitely be open to the idea. ",5,2,False,self,,,,,

 * The first way is to decide a priori which sub-populations will share which parameters (for our data this works some of the time).  This way is very fast, but it isn't always a great model because there is no general rule for deciding this.

 * The second way is to find m and b for all sub-populations, then find the unique values by using some clustering methods.  This way takes much more cpu time, which isn't great for our setup but isn't the end of the world; and sometimes we don't have enough data for all sub-populations to make reasonable estimates of the parameters.

Ideally there is a third way that both decides on which parameters are shared by which sub-populations and what the unique values of those parameters are.  

What I am looking for is some literature, or a specific topic to research on.  I have prior distributions for the model parameters, so bonus made up internet points to you if you can suggest a bayesian method.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I am tasked with creating an enormous basketball database with the stats of all players on http://www.basketball-reference.com.  I don't think it's scrapable so looping over all possible urls to download the CSVs seems like my best bet.  The problem is as follows:

one player url: ""players/a/abdulka01.html#per_game::none""
another player url: ""players/b/bryanko01.html""


Their names are in the urls instead of an ordered ID#, so looping over each player is going to be really hard.  


I was thinking about maybe somehow scraping just the names in each letter and creating lists of those to then loop over and pasting them into the urls(**update: I realize that if I go into each letter separately and inspect element on a name, the correct ""name code"" appears in the 'href'.  With a little regex, I can easily extract that**.  For the most part the names, seem to follow the pattern of first five letters of last name and then first two letters of first name followed by a '01' if it's the first instance of that string.  Then I could include an IF statement checking for the name existing and replacing '01' with '02' when needed.

What would you do?  And, if anyone wants a data set, I can deliver a few examples.   


GOAL
To build a clusterer that will cluster ""leaf"" profiles around a ""root"" profile, eliminating non-matching leaf profiles, so that perceived data quality improves.  (definitions of leaves and roots below)


SITUATION
I have a system that track keyword mentions, identifying the account/profile from which it comes.



A profile can be a number of things: 
1) A site, like www.huffingtonpost.com  
2) A Twitter, Facebook or other social account.



A profile that created a mention is a ""root"" profile. 



Once a single profile is identified, the system goes through a process of enrichment. This process adds additional profiles to the identified site/person. These profiles, since they do not have a mention, are considered ""leaf"" profiles.  These types also add, for example, an email address or a phone number as a new type.



And, in this process, I store the identified profiles the ""parent"" profile that identified the new profile. So, I have a hierarchy of the mentions themselves, and how they were found. 



PROBLEM
Generally, there will be 2 to 1000 profiles (usually 2 to 10) and we are more looking for similarity. 



In over 90% of cases, the system produces clean results.  However, in 2 to 3 percent of the cases, the leaf profiles produced don't, on inspection, match the identified. This happens because the internet is messy and malformed. :-)

 

The algorithm I've used up to this point, has been a TFIDF classifier that transforms the profile into a string, using that string to cluster. This works some, but there is a lot of false positive cases (no weights for any term in the string) and many less false negative cases (more because of how people have written their profile descriptions). 



I've tried a few other scenarios, but many produce less effective results.  



I'm at a loss (minus the thought below). Any classifier-based approaches you would try? 



IDEAS
There SHOULD be some weight to the scoring, in that matches of the username or name should have weight over matches in a description in the profile (or other attributes that we have).

I'm currently ABD, but am also interviewing for a data science position across the country. If I take this position, I would essentially be trying to write my dissertation while working full time (they wouldn't be able to defer my offer for long enough). I spoke to my adviser about this possibility and he was skeptical (with a good case) that I could graduate on time if I worked that way, just because of how much time and effort I would realistically be able to devote to finishing up.

Having said that, if the place I am interviewing at continues to impress me, I would really like to accept their offer. Has anyone had similar experiences? My specific questions are:

1) If I take the offer, is it contingent on me finishing? That is, in a worst case scenario where I try and juggle both at once and find that I have too much on my plate, what are my options?

2) Am I placing too much value on a single offer and should I just knuckle down and write this dissertation?

3) From a hiring point of view, what is the difference between someone who left ABD and someone who has a PhD? On one hand, the latter might show some level of commitment to finishing something, but I also get the sense that most people just care about what your skillset and experience is.

Basically, I don't want to make a decision that will screw up my long-term future. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",4,2,False,self,,,,,

I have 3 years experience in management consulting, specifically around information management, and an undergrad degree in information science. 

I decided to apply to three pretty different programs, and ended up getting accepted to all: 

* [CMU MISM-BIDA](http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-information-systems-and-management/information-systems-management-mism/business-intelligence-data-analytics/index.aspx): Pros - mixes management courses with data analytics courses, well established program, great placement rate. Cons - Less technical core curriculum (though options to place out of courses and take electives)

* [Columbia University MS in Data Science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science): Pros - very technical curriculum, great location, prestigious name, access to NYC start-up scene. Cons - new program (first flight graduated 3 months ago) with no placement data, less elective courses

* [UT Austin - MS in Business Analytics](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/business-analytics): Pros - 1 year program, pretty solid technical core. Cons - seems like a one year add-on to an undergrad degree, lower average salary

I'm mostly leaning towards Columbia or CMU, but I would love to hear about your experience or option on any of these programs.

In regards to building my data set to be used in training, I want to use all customers who churned in the past, set as a 1, and all currently active customers set as  a 0 for binary classification.

If I were to do this, then use a full current list of customers to be used as the final prediction set, would this cause errors as the same records will be seen in prediction that the model was trained on?

My idea is that as certain variables change for customers as time moves forward, the probability of churning will change.

My worry is that if the model sees customer A with certain values did not churn in the training set,  it will always set it as a low probability of churning in the future even if some of its variables have changed.

Best case would be if certain variables for Customer A change the model will set its risk of churning higher. Is this a okay approach of should I extract a distinct training set and use only records not trained on to predict on. Which would lead to a smaller training set and prediction set.

2 year ago I started on a February Computer Science degree which gives us a A.P in Computer Science.

Normally the school offers a Top Up with a length of 1 year that gives a bachelor in Computer Science.

The school has closed this Top Up with summer start. They only take in people for the Top Up at February now ...

My options are the following:

- Work till February then take the Top Up (total length to obtain bachelor 2 years)
- Start at the other university to obtain their computer science degree (total length 2 years, but most of it is part time because there will be a course here and there)


I have in the specialization in the A.P. degree worked with NoSQL, SQL and Machine learning and I find this very interesting. Besides that I have a student job working with SQL and large amounts of data.

So I have considered the following option:

- Take a 3 year bachelor in Mathematics and technology (A bachelor that looks at math with view of technology problems). After this degree start working. This means no Masters degree.


If I take the Top Up on 2 years then I will be able to obtain a masters in 1 year after the bachelor.
If I take the math bachelor in 3 years I will not be able to obtain a masters degree.

How is the data science worlds look at people without a masters degree?
How is the combination of a A.P. Computer Science and a B.sc. Math?

PS!
I can only afford to spend 3 years on studies.

I have had two phone consecutive interviews wherein I was asked what I would do if I were given data and how I would validate a model. Both times the conversation drifted away from clustering algorithms, decisions trees and other bleeding-edge ML techniques into stats 101 territory. 

I accept that many things follow a normal distribution: human height, mechanical failure rate, natural processes with measurable outcomes, etc. In contrast there are many interesting phenomena that have *no* distribution at all: the weather, the stock market, human behavior, and (I would argue) almost anything on the frontier of big data. As a result, any predictive model one constructs is, at best, a windsock not a crystal ball.

It is almost as if no one wants to talk about the pragmatic aspects of the DS/ML; they instead want to focus on their background in statistics 101 and play stump the chump during the interview. The p-value is an abused statistic that can be slapped into any executive summary. With numbers, everyone can feel like they made a ""data driven decision"". If that actually worked, we would foresee every financial crisis before it happened.

I am a student and am finishing up a degree in a hard science. I am working on this, and a couple other projects,  because I am hoping to transition into data science after I graduate. I am particularly interested in working in the gaming industry to improve the player experience.  

Now, onto the problem at hand. I am processing an API that contains information about player deaths in a first person shooter. It contains information like an identifier for both the player that died and the one that completed the kill, if it was a head shot, the weapon that was used, a timestamp, and a couple of other fields. 

I want to try and isolate players who are trading kills with one other player and not interacting with other players to detect a play style that is inconsistent with the terms of use of the game.  

The raw data rate for the game is about 2GB/day. The input format is also pretty inefficient, so I can compress this a bit, but if I am going to process data for a reasonable duration I am going to have to worry about storing even aggregated data in memory. Ultimately, to detect cheating I have to preform this analysis on every player, which is part of the reason that I have to be efficient with data storage.  

I have stored about 4 GB of data as a test data set to test new code on. Once I develop a method, I want to switch over to live processing on the data stream. I would also love to make a dashboard for the data stream, but there is a lot of work I need to do first.

It is relatively simple to make a histogram of a particular players death rate as a function of time. A poor mans method of detecting this type of cheating would be to determine if a player killed one other player more than once per minute for at least 5 minutes without killing any other players. This could be done by making a two dimensional histogram with a row for every other player on the server. About 30k players log in a day on a single server so I suspect there are something like a million characters on the server. This method doesn't seem to be sufficiently efficient for this data set.

My current plan is to store some general stats as a time series for all players and all times. I haven't decided on a bin duration of this data, but I am leaning towards a minute in length. I want to store things like the number of deaths, number of kills, as well as other aggregated stats on the player during that minute. In addition, I will keep a buffer of all data for the last hour (again selected arbitrarily.) I flag a player as being suspicious if they cross an arbitrary threshold, say killing a single player at least 5 times in a 5 minute period without killing any other players. When a player is flagged I will save all of the information for that player for a period starting an hour before the flag (allowed by the buffer) and extending an hour after the flag. If they continue to be suspicious the duration will be extended. This will let me do an exploration of the player's data if it is interesting and probably won't require much storage space (&lt;100 KB per flag?.) 

Using the time series data, I can compare the players kill rate and other stats during the suspicious period with the rest of their play time to determine if this play appears to be very atypical for the player. Are they doing substantially better than they typically do? How improbable is it that they just got lucky?  I can also try to determine if, when the player is being suspicious, their time series data is similar to the time series data from other players. What fraction of the population has ever produced stats that are better than what the current player just did. Is it possible that the player typically plays while distracted and they are just really working hard now or has no one ever done this well? If they go from being a pretty middle tier player to the top 1% is that an indication of something? Did a friend who is really good come over and is showing them how to play on their account?

The final component for storing the data is that at some point I will presumably have to start making old data more coarse in time to save on bandwidth as this continues to run or else the time series data itself will eventually get to large to store in memory.  

I would love to store additional data that I haven't included here. As an example, a player may be much better with a particular weapon. It is possible that some of the outliers in the data will be because the player switched back to their best weapon. I would love to store the number of kills with each weapon in the general time series data, but that will inflate it by a factor that could conceivably be between 2 and 20 depending on how cleverly I can store the data. Therefore I am not convinced this is feasible.  

I was curious if anyone had any recommendations on a better way of storing the data, a different way of thinking of the problem, python packages I should look at for doing this, or anything else that is constructive. I am doing the work in python with the pandas library, which I am falling in love with.

The fact that this is a hobby project introduces some additional constraints. I don't want to spend a bunch of money, so I am looking for open source tools. I want to use more than about 1 TB of data storage on my machine for the project. And I am limited to about 8 GB of free memory on my local machine.  Therefore I want to apply these constraints to any possible solutions to this problem. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Tomorrow I have an onsite interview for a data science internship at one of the Big 4, and my recruiter has made it evident that I should bring questions to the interview (I always do, but I digress). I've begun forming up some okay questions, like: 

* ""To you, what does it mean to do data science at &lt;Big_4&gt;, and particularly within &lt;interviewer_team&gt;? Would you consider it somewhat different compared to non-&lt;interviewer_team&gt; teams?""

* What kind of data-scientist they identify as (see [this](http://qr.ae/RqyCK3)) and how that contributes to the (data science team/organization at large).

* Given their time at &lt;Big_4&gt; and different skill sets they bring to &lt;interviewer_team&gt;, what would they say has been their biggest takeaway  technical or otherwise?

These questions are things I've also been interested in, but I obviously don't want to throw out just any question. I'm interested in the *field* of data science, including the scaffolding that it's built on. That said, I'm not sure that interviewers care about philosophical-type, ""To you, what does it mean to be a data scientist?"".

That said, **if you were interviewing a candidate, what questions would you want them to ask?** I'm doing hardcore research on &lt;Big_4&gt; and their data science and data infrastructure blogs, but would definitely welcome any feedback. Thanks all!

**TL;DR:** I've got an interview coming up and want to show the interviewers that I'm seriously interested in how &lt;Big_4&gt; is applying data science. How do I go about this?",17,9,False,self,,,,,

I work for a company that is a little behind the times when it comes to data analysis.  I work in Sales Operations and since I seem to be one of the most technically oriented it's fallen to me to be our de facto statistician.

About 6 months ago, I was tasked with finding a way to quantify the sales activity of our new brand that isn't doing well (essentially is sales not doing their job, or is the product not up to snuff).  Our company tends to send out tracking spreadsheets that come back filled out completely wrong, so I finally decided enough is a enough, got some budget and worked with our IT team to create a tool to collect the data through a mobile Sharepoint Site with drop down menus.  We launched in January, and three months later I have about 1500 activities logged that are nice and clean telling me what customer, sales activity (training, sales call, pitch new product, floor new product, influencer call, event), and product/program the sales person has done.  I've been able to create weekly reports to sum everything up for sales mangers, and executives, everyone is very happy.

Now comes the part I've been worried about since I don't really have a background in statistics and I'm very much self taught in sales analysis.  I have the sales figures as well as the activity data at my fingertips, and now I want to run a regression analysis to determine what types of activity or what program is most effective at moving the needle.

I just completed a VBA course so I am hoping there is some method to do this, but google searching has not given me any good examples except how to run simple Linest formula's.  I have no idea if my data is going to be linear, exponential, or logarithmic.  I know there is the best fit method to determine it, but with some many different variations of products and program and customers it's overwhelming.

Can anyone point me in the direction of a resource that may help with a method to do this?  

tl;dr  Have 8 different variables that I need to best fit and run regression on with VBA, looking for some resources to help me figure out how to do this.",5,5,False,self,,,,,

Basically there's a probability that I hit any light, and then a percentage of said light's duration that I have to stop at the light.

The first image is 200 trials, with the top graph the raw data (with number of traffic lights hit written over each point), while the second is the same data but sorted low to high.  The second image is the same thing but 10,000 trials.

What I'm curious about is why the bottom curve is not linear.  I would think it would be, given that the longer you sit at lights, the longer the commute is, and that all lights are equal?  I'm not sure; I'm not trained in data science haha.  Anyone have some insight into why it's relatively linear then suddenly goes exponential?  I'm also not too sure why there's a jump from 17 minutes once a light is hit (I think that may just be a logic error).

Some information about myself: 
1. I am a college sophomore with marketing major. I have zero (and I really mean ""zero"") background on coding or any programming language. 

2. The reason I want to study data science is that I want to work in the field of market research and client service in a marketing agency, in which I know data science skills would make me a desirable candidate. I don't want to become a hard-core data analyst, but I think some knowledge on manipulating and visualizing data would come in handy (please correct me if I'm wrong)

3. I love reading news articles that use data (and data visualization) to back up its arguments. I enjoy reading FiveThirtyEight and some other websites focusing on infographics.

4. I am currently learning R programming using the book called ""R Programming for Data Science"" written by Roger Peng and Tableau using its tutorial videos.

I want to ask you guys, especially who work in the field of marketing, two questions about the use of data science

1. What are some others skills that you think are necessary to have to do what I want to do in the future (market research, client service, and hopefully, marketing consulting in long-run)?

2. Do you have any **step-by-step learning process** (what should I learn first, which books or websites) to learn about data science in general. Do you think [this](http://i1.wp.com/blog.udacity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RoadToDataScientist1-1024x831.png) look good and attainable?

A technical paper describing the optimization is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07749.  It is available as free and open source software. This release is just the first step toward providing a suite of algorithms that will assist biomedical researchers in analyzing their data to obtain causal insights.
 
Using simulated data, FGS was able to learn a causal network on data containing 50,000 variables and 1,000 samples in about 15 minutes on a laptop computer. While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.

FGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; the APIs can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal). Additional details and instructions for downloading both these versions of the software are available at

Our goal is to help the biomedical community use causal modeling to gain novel insights and drive innovative research, so we hope to make these tools as usable and useful as possible.  We welcome any and all feedback that you might have, which will help us improve this and future releases.
