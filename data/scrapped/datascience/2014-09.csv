I'm coming from a physics background, and what I think of when I hear the word model is probably quite different from the concept that is being conveyed in the data science context.  Would someone care to ELI5 what this actually means (an example would rock also)?  Is it just making plots and fitting the plot with some functional form?  Thanks!

I saw a similar question posted 2 years ago [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/okm5c/can_anyone_suggest_a_semester_project_related_to/) and seems they were suggesting projects on Kaggle. One more thing is that the problem itself should not be too trivial because I've to present it as a part of my final year b.tech. course. 

I really liked this one : https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10

I'm really sorry if this doesn't fly in /r/datascience, but I'm really new to this industry and I've been working on a project for the past couple months, and I can't seem to figure it out.

Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/2fyigb/showing_that_something_is_normal/). I'm not going to repeat that post, as I have a slightly better way to describe the problem:

We collected a large amount of data on our customers and product. Some of the customers sent complaints about the product saying it's faulty, and we want to know whether this claim is true so we can pick out the customers who are sending in false complaints. I'd imagine that a ""normal"" product has a certain set of attributes whereas a faulty product has different values, so if a customer sends us a complaint about the product and all the attributes appear normal, we can conclude that the complaint is false.
What we've tried previously is clustering. Using the product attribute values as coordinates, we ran k-means clustering on the data, assuming that ""normal"" and ""faulty"" products will each form their own clusters, but we're not sure if this is a good approach.

And before you ask, yes, it'd be much cheaper to investigate the data rather than to pay up whenever there's a claim that the product is faulty. Each one takes tens of thousands to even millions of dollars to address, this project fell on us entry-level employees/interns (so they're not paying us much), and the data is ours so it's free.

I'm going to keep this short instead of writing an essay, but if more info would be useful, I can give more.  I am a current post-candidate PhD student in Biomedical Engineering.  By passing my candidacy exam, I received a Masters Degree.  I have probably 2.5 years until I graduate.  I am already on about 8 publications, including 2 first-author papers and 1 first-author review article.
Because of my skillset (I frequently do programming, run simulations on large sets of data, analyze said data, etc.) I was approached with an offer to join a data analytics team at a Fortune 100 company as a data scientist in the Midwest.  The starting salary is $85k + benefits, bonuses, absurd amounts of vacation time, a clear raise track, etc.

What is more valuable for my career at this point if I am certain that I want to pursue a career in Data Science: Finishing the PhD, but having no practical work experience, or taking the job and getting 2.5 years of experience with a Masters degree?  I am on a fellowship, so while the change to a real salary is very nice, I wouldn't take the money difference if it would potentially hurt my future career.

Any feedback is appreciated.  I guess I'm just asking if NOT having a PhD will hurt my future career options.

EDIT: Clarification: I earned my Master's by passing my candidacy exam.  This is in the Midwest, to give a perspective on the Salary.",22,7

After much thought, I have decided to pursue data analysis as a career and passion. So, for the next 9 months or so, I plan on dedicating the majority of my time to learning the information and tools I need to be successful. I plan on utilizing MOOCs and other various internet resources and will be doing this basically full-time. On the side, I will be tutoring and doing odd jobs for a sustaining income. 

Quick background: Graduated 2 years ago with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Have been working as a Manufacturing Engineer since. Very little to no programming experience. A basic, natural understanding of statistics. Quick learner (I like to think). Familiar with linear algebra but could definitely use a review. 

I have looked over  [The Open Source Data Science Master's](http://datasciencemasters.org/) and the information is great. However, I feel there is a lack of direction. It would be excellent if there was a general learn this, then learn that, or learn this while learning this and then learn that - more of an organized curriculum, ya know?

My question to you is: If you had 9 months off and wanted to kickstart your data analysis career and were starting fresh, what steps would you take and in what order (sequential, parallel)? Should I start a blog to document my experience for future employment? 

I am currently going through ""Learn Python the Hard Way"" and plan on enrolling ""Machine Learning"" on coursera this month but other than that, I'm unsure of the next best steps. Please advise!

Thanks

I'm pretty sure we'll be using R for class, but I'd like to build up the Python skills side by side with the R skills.

This one (Learning SciPy for Numerical and Scientific Computing, Blanco-Silva) seems like the best one I could find on Amazon..

Just curious if there are any others out there I might've overlooked? I'm definitely picking up the O'Rielly Data Wrangling book as well, but that seemed a bit general (and mostly Pandas), so I wanted one that might be a bit more math focused.

Anyone have the Blanco-Silva book? Just thought I'd reach out before hitting the order button.

The problem is semiconductor yield modeling. We have an X training set of 9,999 rows and 2,000 columns. Each column represents a unique context/process that the wafer could have run through. It's all just 1 or 0 dummy variables. 

We also have a Y training set which is the synthetic yield output with 600 being a black map and 0 being 100% wafer success.

Lastly we are given a validation set for X which we use to predict Y. We are given a validation Y to check our ""score"".

My question to you all is, have any of you gone through a masters degree related to data science? If so, what are your overall thoughts on the program? Would you recommend it to people in my boat? 

Since it's a fairly new field, I feel like there are just overwhelming amount of information on the internet. I wanted to get some real opinions instead of school advertisements.
