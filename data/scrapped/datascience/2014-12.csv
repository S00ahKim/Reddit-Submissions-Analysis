0,2014-12-1,2014,12,1,11,2nwfzu,Psych PhD student looking to transition into NLP/data science career,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/2nwfzu/psych_phd_student_looking_to_transition_into/,psych_to_nlp,1417401058,"First, I did search the FAQ and the subreddit for relevant posts. I did find one similar post by a neuro grad student, but since my background and desired career path are slightly different, I decided I should still post. Apologies if I am erring by posting this...

Im a 4th year psychology graduate student focused on language that is realizing he probably wants to move into computational linguistics and/or data science type jobs in industry after graduation. Im wondering if you all could make some recommendations on how to make that happen.

A little more about my current background/skillset...

Language/linguistics background

* Ive taken a whole host of classes on language and linguistics, usually more on the psycholinguistics side than on the more pure ling side (semantics is my biggest gap). My research/expertise is mostly in language development and change using human experiments and computational modeling. Ive also been working on a latent semantic analysis-type project.

Quant/stats/math/comp sci background:

* Calc 2 in college (9 years ago!) and linear algebra this semester
* A two semester stats sequence that all psych grad students must take (we covered t-test, Mann-Whitney, correlation (parametric and non-parametric), ANOVA, chi-square, regression (linear, logistic, polynomial), PCA). This was three years ago
* A mixed undergrad/grad level intro to computational linguistics (where I started the LSA project) a year ago
* A grad level class this semester on theory of computation, neural networks, and dynamical systems, all with an eye to (psycho)linguistics
* One mini-course (4 weeks) on comp models of sound change, and another on probability and information theory (again with an eye to linguistic applications). Many of the models and concepts I learned in these courses have recurred in my work, so I do feel like I still have a handle on them.

Programming

* I took a 4 week course on python a year ago and have used it pretty regularly since then. I consider myself beginner to intermediate-ish with it. I use NLTK for the LSA project I mention above but havent really intellectually engaged with NLTK much since the comp ling class. I have also used R occasionally but not nearly as much as Python. Basically, right now I would feel comfortable programming in python without internet assistance; less so with R.


So thats me. What do? What gaps in my current background/skillset should I be working on?

I am looking at a few internships (factual, idibon, DSSG have all popped up) for next summer in NLP and data science positions. I think I meet the qualifications for a number of these, but I worry that others are more qualified. Im also looking at masters programs in comp ling, although Id really like to avoid any more schooling after I finish my phd (which I do plan to do).

One concrete decision before me is whether I should take a mixed undergrad/grad level intro to syntax next semester (supposedly good class), or an undergrad level CS class on data structures and algorithms (also supposedly good). Both interest me. Relevant caveats: I do know the very basics of natural language syntax, and I dont know Java (I just barely started a tutorial in it), which is the language of the CS class. Thoughts?

**TL;DR. Im a psych grad student studying language that wants to get into industry jobs in NLP and/or data science. Recommendations? Most immediate question: should I take a mixed grad/undergrad class on syntax, or an undergrad class on data structures and algorithms?**

**EDIT**: Threw a couple projects up on [github](https://github.com/drussellmrichie). They are among my first programs, having mostly been written a year ago, but they are also two of my most substantial.",10,2

My question to the sub and anyone who may also be in a hiring role, what type of analysis would stand out to you in a hiring situation? My initial thought is to go to data repositories and complete analysis on several different unrelated data sets for experience, but is that valuable from a hiring perspective? Any other suggestions of actual analysis I can complete that would be valuable in a hiring interview?

In every industry I analyze, I see that data-driven solutions are crucial to future growth, so I want to make the transition from a consolidating business to a growing one. 

I've been reading about what data scientists do and the best way to describe why I'm interested is that being able to analyze large data sets with a computer (instead of a gui like excel) sounds almost like getting a 6th sense. I had a really good memory where my teacher gave a huge data set once to demonstrate how 'blind' we are with such large quantities of data. Excel literally couldn't handle it!

In a nutshell, I know some pure math and basic coding syntax. I know linear algebra, abstract algebra, and real analysis, and I'm decent at probability brain teasers. I've also been reading python and R (but not practicing enough). I don't know any statistics, formal probability theory, algorithms, data structures, optimization.

I did skim through scikit learn documentation, and what kind of scares me is not knowing how to properly apply the functions from a theory standpoint. It feels like voodoo because as someone who knows some pure math, I'm aware that it's pretty easy to abuse math and come up with nonsense.

A little background, I'm 27 and recently went back to school fulltime to pursue a degree after working a retail management job for a number of years when I initially delayed pursuing a college degree because in all honesty I had no idea what I wanted to do. So as of right now I am a sophmore in an ECE program pursuing electrical engineering. I originally was attracted to EE because of a love for electronics and the broad field where I could specialize in a branch that I found most enjoyable. Still not positive on which branch/field but I am leaning towards a field in telecommunications engineering. The more I read about data science the more I get excited about the field and job opportunities. I have always been pretty good at math which is why I have always been attracted to engineering so I think I could excel at the courses involved. My worry is I remember reading an article or comment where the writer stated data science is still pretty new so any majors haven't been able to fine tune what exactly should be in the curriculum in which would leave graduates unprepared anyway. So should I continue in EE with the hopes I'll be able to still get into data science career or should I switch to the new degree program. I should also state that switching would set me back probably another year or possibly 2 
for a degree, which if I was younger wouldn't be a problem but seeing as I'm looking at graduation age of 29/30 as is I don't know if it's a wise decision and should just be focused graduating as quickly as possible and getting work experience.",3,2

One problem is, the last Math (Calculus/Algebra) course I took was 3 or 4 years ago, meaning I forgot almost all the math except for Probability and basic Statistics (took it last year). 

Going back to all the University stuff will make me change my mind about going into Data Science. It's just the idea of reviewing everything again, without knowing what exactly is needed for Data Science is holding me back.

I'm doing a bachelor in mathematics, and all of our courses are (of cause) very theoretical. However, for the courses on statistics I find it problematic that we never see any practical use of the theory, and it makes it a lot harder for me to motivate myself. 

This semester I have realised that data science is really the thing that gets my motor running, and I'm therefore looking for books that can give me a bit more motivation for following the courses. ",21,7

I am going to finish my PhD in less than one year.

I am pondering what I could do afterwards. I worked in the field of neuroscience, working in a lab specialized in measuring animal behaviour. The work is interesting (and physically hard) but I would like to change field for a different number of reasons.

I have started to get interested in data science recently, also for my job I always find interesting spending time thinking about the best way of analysing my data. 

I have a background in psychology, so we studied quite a lot of statistics, even if at a very superficial level (they taught us which tests we should use in specific experiments but not exactly the maths behind those tests). 
At high school I was really good in math and I did a bit of programming.

In order to fill my gaps I am following a course about R on coursera and I am planning to start a class for learning Python basics at the beginning of January.

After my PhD I will try to apply either for a Master in bioinformatics or I will try to acquire some experience in a lab specialised in analysing genomic data (I am still plaining to remain inside the neuroscience field).

I would just like to ask you if there is anything more I could do while I am still doing my PhD to fill my gaps: can you suggest me any online course, book or anything else I could use to fill my gaps?  Do you know about anyone else in similar conditions with a background not in statistics who has been able to become a data scientist?

I am not scared of studying a lot, the possibility of being able to give a shape and a meaning to a bunch of raw data just deeply excites me.


Thanks in advance.",24,4

I'm in my 1st year but already have a M.A. in math, so I probably have about 3.5 years left or so. I absolutely love math, but I am not sure that academia is for me for several reasons, so I have been thinking about what a plan B should be and how I can prepare for it. Data science (whatever that really is) has been in the back of my mind for awhile but I haven't given it serious thought. I came across this article yesterday http://www.wired.com/2014/12/deep-learning-renormalization/ and read the related arXiv posting and found myself suddenly ridiculously excited about machine learning. Data science is more than just that, but I find the whole process interesting as well.

Anyways, my research is on mathematical physics. I don't have a specific dissertation topic yet but I spend a lot of time thinking about knot theory, conformal field theory, topological quantum field theory, mirror symmetry, quantum topology, Kahler geometry, quantization, etc. The renormalization group (the object mentioned in the article) actually comes up frequently in my work as well.

My first question:Are there any other tools from mathematical physics that have found use in data science-related topics? I was really surprised about the renormalization group &lt;-&gt; deep learning connection and it is quite beautiful.

My second question: What should somebody in my position be doing in order to be able to be hired as a data scientist upon graduation? I am currently considering taking the undergraduate Machine Learning course at my university next term to get my feet wet. I think I will end up taking a statistics course to satisfy some breadth requirement. I plan to play around with some Kaggle tutorials or something over this winter break. But, for example, are there data science internships for STEM graduate students that would hire someone who works on a completely unrelated topic? How much coursework should I put into this? I have time to take as many courses as I like, I suppose, but more courses would further delay graduation. I quite like being a graduate student though, so I'm not in any hurry to finish. And any miscellaneous advice you might have.

Most recently, I am finishing what will be an approximately 4000 line program which automates a lot of the munging, visualization, inference and optimization the client does.

I'm a little unsure of what the coefficient of determination is used for. In my reading materials, it says the coefficient of determination (r^2 ) is:    

&gt;the percentage of the variable which can be attributed to the relationship    
&gt;e.g. a coefficient of determination of 0.63 means 63% of the variation in Y can be attributed to X    

So, does this mean to say that, let's say Y is obesity and X is mass of cake consumed, any movement in obesity is 63% directly attributable to cake consumed, and therefore 37% is other factors?     

Does this mean also that if you observe someone eating a certain amount of cake, you can calculate how much more obese he will get (using z-scores maybe? not sure how this would work)?

I am a junior at a trimester school (recently finished my first junior trimester) and I just discovered data science after I found that finance might not be for me (not necessarily due to the difficulty, but rather the topics, my level of interest, and nature of the work that deterred me after speaking with many people currently in the industry). I study a math/statistics/social science hybrid of sorts (all one major) and economics (my second major), along with participating in a competitive finance certificate program. I am debating on keeping the math/statistics/social science major but changing my economics major to a statistics major (although there might be some overlap with my current major, there are actually a lot of additional courses in the stats major not covered in my current major and I also get to skip a few courses due to my current major) and adding on a computer science minor.

To give some background on my interest, I love working with data especially when it pertains to social settings. Statistics was one of my favorite high school courses, and my college courses on mathematical methods in social analysis (pretty much econometrics) have increased my appreciation of the power behind numerical analysis. Data science is interesting to me because it really seems like it is a profession on the frontier of modern social data analysis. I understand that data science involves much more than just math and statistics, and would appreciate any advice in what CS courses or online resources in specific would be very helpful to understanding exactly what data science entails. 

However, the issues start with my recent change in interest. I only studied preliminary java in high school, and have very little coding experience outside of that class. I am starting my computer science minor next trimester, but it seems awfully late for me to immerse myself into the field before I apply for jobs my senior year. Here are a few of my questions:

1) In finance (specifically investment banking) and consulting, internships seem rather critical especially your junior year summer prior to going through recruitment your senior year for full time. Does a similar ""requirement"" exist to be successful through recruitment in the data science field as a recent college graduate? (I would guess not due to the novelty of it and the nature of the work, since a lot of it seems to be based on knowledge rather than experience).

2) Should I pursue an internship in data science this next summer given my level of knowledge by then? By then I will have learned some fundamentals behind computer programming in C++ (and possibly another language, but not R) and have taken some additional statistics courses (I can give further details if someone is curious!). 

3) If I cannot find an internship in data science, should I spend the summer simply learning more about data science, or wait for my next year where I will be taking a lot of critical courses in CS that would help towards the field? I forgot which courses in specific these were, but things such as data structures and machine learning were involved.

4) Am I in over my head, and should I be pursuing a masters in data science instead? Would I be able to join a masters program in data science if I only minor in computer science? 

5) What are the best sources for learning more about data science, and gaining the essential skills?

and finally:

6) What is one question/concern that I haven't asked yet, that I should really be asking at this point, given my situation?

What libraries can I completely skip? What learning resources do you think would be appropriate in my case?

The data I'm working with takes time series values as inputs with a separate output variable. Each row of data looks something like y(i), x(i,1), x(i,2), ..., x(i,Tmax) where y(i) is the i^th output variable and x(i,j) is the i^th input variable at time j. So essentially for each row I have one output variable and one input variable that changes with time. 

The problem is, I don't really have any idea of how to work with this. I can't treat each x(i,j) as a separate input variable because there are hundreds of them in each row (and they're not independent). The main variables I've been working with are the area under the curve of the x values with respect to time, the maximum and minimum x for each row, and the first few fourier coefficients of each x, but none of them really seem to produce great results. Is there anything else I can try? Are there any ""best practices"" when it comes to working with this kind of data?",6,2

I graduated with a bachelor's in industrial engineering from Georgia Tech in 1998.  
  
I hear this phrase ""data science"" a lot which I find both interesting and amusing.  My IE curriculum consists of programming classes, stats/probability classes, linear programming, operations research, SQL, database mgt, modelling with simulation, business mgt, and accounting classes, along with all the other core, traditional engineering classes.
  
Based on what I've read about what data science supposedly is, I feel like I've already have the background knowledge to become a data scientist.  Thus when I read all these posts where people ask what degree they should pursue or how to become a data scientist, why don't people suggest industrial engineering + some other classes to fill in the gaps or perhaps modern industrial engineering curriculum have already adapted data science courses?  I do not know of any recent IE grads so I dont know and would like to hear from them too.  

Actually, what I find amusing about ""data science"" is that I see parallels between data science and industrial engineering.  Industrial engineering back then was something not a lot of people knew what it entails or assumed it was about just optimizing factory performance or profitability.  Maybe ""industrial engineer"" doesn't sound as sexy or buzzwordy as ""data scientist"", but I feel they are very similar in responsibility and knowledge based on what I have read so far.  
  
Regardless, based on the classes that I took 16+  yrs ago and what I stated above, I am curious to hear from actual data scientists and also industrial engineers on what they think about my thoughts about industrial engineering as a basis to enter the data science field?
