Im a Sr. Data Analyst with 6 years of experience.  The first 3 as a financial analyst.

**Skillset**:  I am extremely strong in financial modeling.  I have strong skills in SAS, R, and python.  I am good at data visualization knowing d3js and Tableau.

**Weaknesses**:  While I can do most things in SAS, R, and python.  I have limited experience in applying them in a work place setting.  When I apply them towards datascience, I more or less read how to do a technique and then try to apply it to a work problem.  Basically, I hhave a gap in actually applying statistics in a work place setting.   

Additionally, Im prone to mistakes when I get into massive data pulls/aggregations.  However, normally I do this ad hoc,  and on extremely quiick time frames for one off analysis.  But, I am no data architect.

I am personable and give good presentations. My networking skills lack.

**Current Role** I have been at the company for 2.5 years.  I started in FP&amp;A doing financial planning and was promoted to a Sr. Data Analyst at the Year mark. At the 18 month mark,  I was given a 6 percent raise in my current role.  Alot of people on my team got promoted around this time, so it could of been to not upset me that I didnt get promoted.  In the past two months, I got moved from reporting to my old manager to directly reporting to the VP. I have built a much stronger rapport with my current manger than my previous.  My previous gave me a good review, but it was just an akward relationship where he never really spoke to me.

 I make 95k a year in a large city just outside the top 10 in the US.

My work consist of churn modeling, identifying customers for targeted marketing/sales campaigns, and financial modeling.

** Pros of my position**  I report directly into the VP of our department.  I do alot of ad hoc firedrill financial modeling request for him that gives me alot of visibility inside the company.  Basically, on the org chart im on par with people 4 levels above me.  All my coworkers who were Sr. Analyst and were promoted to a manager are 3 Direct reports away from the VP.  This is good for me as i interact with sr management on a regular basis.

Also pros, the VP has a passion for data and would allow me to try out any data science technique i wanted.  He encourages this actually. so i have an opportunity to get alot of experience using stats and data sceience at a large company.   

**Cons**
The only cons for me are  ego related. For other people, they woudl hate the hours.  I have fire drill weeks where i do put in 80 hours a week in the office and nearly no one else in our department has that.  But, I dont mind because i feel like thats why i have the responsibilities i do and report directly into the vp to have those big responsibilites.  I dont have kids or a relationship and dont party. so this isnt really that big of a deal to me.

For me, I dont like how my job title isnt in line with the org chart.  There are many people with less experience than I do, with the next level in job title.  Some are fresh out of school.  I could make more then them for all i know, but I guess i just dislike having the lowest job title in the room all the time even when people are 4-5 years younger.

**Next STep**

I think i more or less will have to ask for a promotion to get one.  I think thats why others have gotten promoted so fast despite having less responsibilities and worse reviews to the point some got let go after being promoted.

So, if i go in and talk to my boss who is pretty high up at the company. I have to have an idea of what I want my next step of my career to be.

I hate reporting. I hate data architetct type work.  I enjoy financial modeling and data analysis that is used for presentations. meaning just not one off ad hoc bs. I like giving presentations.

Also, in my freetime, I love learning datasceince and programming.

I think my dream job would be one of these consultants that comes into a company, looks over their data and helps on the strategy front.  Alot of the consultants that my companies have hired that do this, more or less just copy my work and analysis into powerpoints anyways.

**Question**

1. Would you bring up wanting to be promoted to my boss?  On one hand, my company promotes quickly.  A few people on my team have gone from Analyst to sr. analyst, to the next level up from Sr. Analyst in a single year.  I have way more responsibilites then those people.  And when we had our annual reduction in force, 2 got let go.  So, I feel like its not too early for me to ask for a promotion. But, on the other hand, at OTHER companies, the time i have been in my current role is pretty short and it would be considered fast to promote me.

2.  What skills do i need to learn to make me more invaluable/increase my earning potential in the work force? Id prefer to stay away from Big Data Architect type of work.

3.  What are some responsibilities that I could ask for that would help progress my career/skillset?  I dont have to ask for a flat out promotion, I could just ask for responsibilities that I want to work towards having.

I am currently a candidate for a MSc in Data Science. I started the program today and it is a two-year program.

This past summer I was hired as a Data Analyst Intern at a startup. Although I was not officially Data Scientist Intern, I did do some machine learning while on the job and implemented algorithms at various points. I don't think there is much difference between a Data Analyst Internship and a Data Scientist Internship **within a tech startup**. I do not know how data analyst interns operate in accounting firms, banks, etc.

**The Interview**

After a phone screening, I was invited to interview at the office. The first part was a behavioral interview with the Data Team Lead. The second part was a technical interview with the Data Scientist. 

Q1: Explain one of your projects on your resume to me as if I am a client.

A: The best way to answer this question is to be as vague as possible. Clients/non-engineering members don't care about the algorithm you used or the results of the confusion matrix. What they do care about is how these results will affect their profits or their company in general. Don't talk about the decision tree implementation, talk about how the significant factors you found that led to the classification of the predicted value.

Q2: Design a retail/book/grocery store relational database

A2: Basically you want a table of all the transactions, the items and their prices, customers, each with keys that can join to the other table. I was also asked to limit the tables, join the tables, order a table and group by a table. We ran out of time, but the next part was CTEs.

**The Internship**

As an intern I was asked to do a variety of things. However, my most used skill while at my internship was web-scraping. I developed scripts to scrape websites for a variety of information needed to make the company's current information more useful. If you do not know how to web scrape, I highly suggest you learn it. I personally use BeautifulSoup.

The data team was very small so I had the opportunity to work on all types of projects, including working with PDF and free text data. Therefore, I also learned how to work with unstructured data. This is a pretty daunting task and if you ever end up having to work with this form of data, I highly recommend keeping your bosses in the loop. I didn't and finished it with only a day to spare which was not ideal. 

I also worked with the data scientist to productionalize and augment the current models. While the data scientist worked on more pressing matters, I was testing different algorithms and examining outputs in forms such as confusion matrices, lift charts, AUC curves, etc. 

**Conclusion**
Overall, I found this experience enjoyable. Although working at big 4 companies is ideal, I think working at start ups in big cities like New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, etc. is also super valuable. Being on a small team gave me some more responsibility than an intern would get and although none of the work I did was critical, it still provided value and left me in good terms with the employer.

If there was anything anyone else wanted to know that won't remove the anonymity of the company. Please ask. I saw some questions about people asking about data science internships an I wanted to give my two cents about my own ""data science"" internship.

I have a search engine where users search by multiple fields (some text, some numerical). It is a custom domain (it's job board, however which domain itself is not important for my question).

I have logged searches, clicks and views from the current search algorithm as deployed in the wild.

I would like to develop a gold standard for evaluating my search engine, so that when I make an improvement I can score it.

One way is to get lots of human guinea pigs to manually annotate and score lots of rankings.

However I am wondering if there's a reliable technique to do this just from the click logs? Would this be less effective? I'd appreciate some pointers towards which algorithm is currently the best/state of the art to use? For example Wikipedia lists about 7 evaluation measures, I have no idea which is the best one, and if they are applicable to data derived from implicit feedback rather than the human guinea pig approach.

I'm working on a data analytics problem, and I need some advice - I'd like to track increases in employee productivity as it correlates to investments in high-performance hardware. For example, I'd like to know the improvements in specific task completion times as a result of jumping from an older PC built around a Pentium D (with hardware like 2GB DDR2 memory, 5400rpm HDDs, etc.) to one built around a 7th-gen Core i5 (8GB DDR4, SATA SSDs, etc.). 

I personally understand that these increases are incredibly dramatic, but I need a way to quantify that in percentages so that I can explain it to the average person. I have access to test PCs of each type, and I can gather user statistics, I just need a workable method to gather the data I'm looking for.

Essentially, I'm looking for a way to evaluate a specific program to see how it utilizes specific hardware. If I can get data such as Task X takes 6:32 (392 seconds) to complete on PC 1 and 3:46 (226 seconds) to complete on PC 2, that would be the perfect type of result. This way I can calculate, for example, that PC 2 offers an X% increase in productivity for Task X, and then I can calculate cost-per-hour savings for particular equipment setups, and make effective recommendations on hardware investments within my company. 

Also, if anyone has any other recommendations that might be helpful in this pursuit, please feel free to share!

I was hoping you guys/girls could give me some information on my best paths if I wanted to create a complicated simulation/model to handle some analysis and problems at work. I started the build in excel and notice some of my colleagues doubting the long-term capability of the model. I was considering writing it in VBA so that it could handle calculations that way without needing RAM to hold all the equations/information at once. However, I believe it would probably be better to build it in more specialized software.


**What I want it to do sorted by priority:**

-Create deep decision trees to handle different tasks.

-Calculate a number of a metrics that would provide us information.

-Dynamically (hopefully quickly) swap data sets out in order to see results for different projects.

-Handle long-form logic of different natures.

-Create visualizations of data, perhaps exportable.

-Handle large amounts of information. (Millions of cells in excel, many of them equations. Equations are repeated a number of times, likely would only need one that iterates downward.)

-A wide variety of modeling assumptions.

-Be easy to use/view/derive information from! (For end users.)


**Secondary/Long-term Objectives**

--Switch Decision tree over to a neural-net/machine learning platform for better decisions.

--Simulate a larger market with a number of inputs.

--Monte Carlo type simulation. (I assume there's likely more advanced forms I don't know about.)


**Bonus Objectives:**

---Software that is affordable/free.



**Additional Info:**

----I know some programming. Not much, but I understand the type of logic and believe I solve problems in a fashion suitable to programming.

----My job already has tableau. Not entirely sure what that handles but I know it's at least a visualization tool.

Specific areas and topics where my time would likely be spent:

* Diagnosing /forecasting / monitoring macroeconomic drivers of company performance
* Customer segmentation and micro-targeting
* Marketing campaign optimization
* Profit optimization of company managed assets
* Natural Language Processing (including multiple languages)
* Some possible applications of neural networks (probably few and far between)

My background is primarily rooted in psychological applications of statistics with some applied knowledge for marketing:

* Psychometrics
* PCA &amp; Factor Analysis
* Linear Regression (and its' various forms) 
* Regularization Techniques
* Decision Trees (excluding bagged/boosted)
* Clustering (k-means &amp; knn)
* Cross Validation

Where I feel most deficient is working with time series data both for forecasting and assessing relationships.

Things I intend to spend time honing:

Programming &amp; Distributed Computing

* Refresh of SQL - **Codecademy**
* Python Programming - **DataCamp**
* Spark SQL - **O'reilly Text**
* Hadoop - **O'Reilly Text**

Deepening Mathematical Foundations

* Refresh on Calculus - **Khan Academy**
* Refresh on Linear Algebra - **Khan Academy**

Expanding Toolkit of Stats / ML Methods:

* Time-series methods (VAR, ETS, Exponential Smoothing, Harmonic Regression)
* Boosting / Bagging
* Neural Nets (nice to have)

I am interested in this online M.S. Data Analytics program from Western Governors University. But I am wary of spending money for a degree that recruiters and hiring officers do not care for. As far as I understand from this subreddit, Masters programs for data science are relatively new so none of them have really much weight to their name.

However, through the M.S. program at WGU, students will study for and complete these certifications :  
Oracle Database SQL (1Z0-071)  
SAS Certified Base Programmer for SAS 9 Credential  
SAS Certified Statistical Business Analyst Using SAS 9

Additionally, the program has courses in Statistics for Data Analysis, advanced SQL, data science techniques, etc. Info about the masters program is [here](https://www.wgu.edu/online_it_degrees/data_analytics_master_degree#).  

Something that really attracted me to this program is the fact that if I finish my degree in 24 months it will cost me $12,000. Costs even less if I take less time to finish the program. So it is incredibly affordable.

So based on that, I think the WGU program is pretty solid. But like I said, I don't work in the data science field, and I have no idea what is actually important.

I have a full time job in a completely different field. Online courses are my only option. I plan to leave my job in 2019.

I work professionally and have a great interest in Data Science. I have been thinking about going ahead and making the step to  apply it at my workplace. Though I have been reading up on the profession, there are a few things about the field (in particular Big Data processing) that I am unclear about. What I would be curious about is setting it in an applied example that might take place at my workplace to really visualize how it works in practice, and perhaps to even help make a business case at my company.

A big example at my workplace would be predicting churn across our subscription products. We have a great deal of clickstream and usage data that we gather through Adobe Analytics, standard marketing data, and specialized customer insight data that tell us about their interests. I imagine with this type of data we could tell a great deal about whether a customer will cancel in the coming year.

With that in mind, perhaps you could help me with the following questions:

1. **Collecting data**
What type of data beyond what I have already mentioned would be most useful for a churn model? What are the most common sources one draws from?

2. **Data Processing**
When are big data techniques (Spark etc) for a model such as I've mentioned appropriate? We do generate a fair amount of data - I am told the clickstream data generates a TB a day. However Adobe Analytics seems to alleviate the need to look into the raw data as it summarizes the data into the metrics you are looking for already. What is the level of expertise a Data Scientist would need with Big Data techniques? Would it be enough to draw data from the clusters, or would there be more required than that?

3. **Data cleaning**
What is the type of data wrangling that would be needed for a churn model? And how would one do feature engineering? There are a great deal of variables to choose from, and I imagine a lot of metrics might be correlated - how would one account for this?

4. **Modeling**
What are the most appropriate models for a churn analysis? Some products are bigger than others, so what models might be best for large datasets and what for smaller? What models perform better for rare outcomes (for example, if you were looking to predict rare upsell opportunities?)

5. **Deployment**
What is the level of proficiency a typical Data Scientist would have with platforms such as AWS? How we do it at our company is the data architect does all that work - is that a typical interaction for a Data Scientist, or would they typically be required to know more?

6. **Maintenance**
We already maintain dashboards on a quarterly basis for senior management. I imagine an effort like this would follow the same process - ie. we would update our churn and other predictions every three months. Is this a trivial process, or is there a lot to think about here? Would this require to update the models constantly as new data becomes available? How is this possible - would you need a new training set?

Thankyou in advance for your help!",3,7,False,self,,,,,

As the title says, I am a historian who has stumbled upon a pretty much complete list of all Anglican people married/baptized in a city throughout the 19th century. 

The problem is that the person who transcribed the information (manually, as most historian work is), transcribed it in a way that is really good for people to read, but bad to do analysis/visualizations.

Any given entry on baptisms might look like this: 


Date of baptism | SURNAME, Name | Date of birth | Name of Father and Mother | Additional Comment (Usually origin of parents, but additional comments may exist)
---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1819/10/03 | CAMERON, Elizabeth | 1816/12/27 | John/Elizabeth Cameron | Belfast/Ireland


While marriages come organized as 

Date | SURNAME, Name of Groom | Origin of Groom | SURNAME, Name of bride | Origin of Bride
----|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------

Now, even untrained me can catch that there is splittable data going on there and there is no explicit indication of a relationship between elements in order to create edges on a network graph. 

My question to you guys is how could I clean/organize that data in order to make some proper analysis. While I am sure that with my sample size (about 900 marriages throughout the century and no more than 20 every year) I could not do heavy graph theory on it, but maybe I could do some cool visualizations in order to extract better conclusions from it. 

At this point, my feeling from reading the source is that 1) over time, the british community had a high rate of loss of its members to the cultural (and religious) context of Brazilian society. I kinda see that because of the low number of children baptized that actually got married in the same place some years later. Obviously there might be some confounding factors such as emigration, but I would want to test it.

2) There are familiar alliances between sections of the british society based up on engagement or not on the African Slave Trade. I can compare the names with the economical activity in other places, but currently I have no way to actually visualize if such alliances exist in a bigger scale.

PS: I have access to Tableau, could dabble in R, the data is in Excel format.

I browse this subreddit quite a bit. Actually it is the first thing I do when I get to work in the morning. I see a lot of posts about data analyst positions and I thought I would share my current experience one month in. 

A little about myself: I graduated from a very good small liberal arts school not super well known for its science and math programs. But I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math. My math minor which included probability models, applied statistics in R, mathematical statistics (proofs of t-test and other things you never want to prove like the Rao-Blackwell theorem), and bayesian statistics with R. I chose work over grad-school because I was unsure exactly what field I wanted to go into and did not want to spend money on a degree that would not further my career. I think the biggest thing that set me apart when I was interviewing was my demonstration that I can learn on my own. Personal projects were something that interviewers were very curious about and I was happy to show them a web-scrapper I built or a website with MySQL developed in django. 

A little bit about my job: I work as a marketing analyst for a natural gas company trying to bring insight into different strategies and predict a variety of different things. This means I do all the sexy things like cleaning data, cleaning data, and cleaning data. I currently use python and R for a lot of my data manipulation. Our company actual uses PowerBI for visualization and reports and it is horribly slow, but very free. Coming out of undergrad I was excited to dive right into applied machine learning algorithms and tried to learn as much as I can about that. But, I think the most important thing is curiosity and wanting to learn about the actual business itself. It is impossible to be a good data analyst if you don't know why the data is being presented to you the way it is. In order to answer interesting questions, you first need to be able to ask them and that all starts with playing with the data and visualizations (EDA!!), not just throwing a random forest regression, SVM, or naive bayes algorithm from scikit-learn. 

Overall it has been a great experience. My math training has been the most useful to me so far, SQL skills have been slowly improving, and I have yet to use any bayesian tricks which I thought was the coolest thing I have every learned, except for solid state physics. 
 
Please pm with questions, I am happy to share my resume. I just recently went through this process and would be happy to talk about my interview experience and all the times I had to fail in order to get the job I have today. Learn how to make reports and try to enjoy it because it is going to be a big part of being a data analyst. I am going to work on some data pipeline stuff using luigi in python, so I would love to hear if anybody has suggestions or things to watch out for, let me know!

I come from an structural engineering background and did an MBA a year ago. During the MBA I developed an interest in data, analytics, and IoT. These are fields I would like to transition towards, but I've been finding it difficult at the moment without the right profile. Today I got accepted into a data science bootcamp (roughly 3 months intensive) with an 85% scholarship because of a project I submitted. It was conceptual - my coding is basic at best, my math is decent. 
I'm currently unemployed, with some options on the horizon, so no major loss ito leaving a job to do this. Even only paying 15%, it's still expensive, plus living costs in a new city for 3 months.
Has anyone had an experience with bootcamps? Is it worth the ""in-depth"" nature (as much as you can in 3 months), as opposed to learning the same thing part time?
I know I can get the right profile for data work with some self-study projects. It's more about time and cost. Even online courses to make up a ""bootcamp"" seem to cost a similar amount when put together. I worry about the quality vs in-person checking and continuous project work.

Thanks!**


Hello, 

Warning in advance, this is a long post. Trying to be specific/detailed enough to get appropriate/relevant feedback. 

I have a B.B.A degree in Economics and I spent a year working in corporate finance at a Fortune 500 company doing internal financial planning and analysis on the expense side. I found this work to be incredibly dry and unfulfilling. I was an ""analyst"", but my work was very simple and didn't require much analytical thought or decision making of any kind. I'm currently traveling internationally and teaching English to sustain myself. During this time, I'd like to build my skill-set to set myself up for a more fulfilling job/career once I return to the U.S. and ""settle down"". 

I really loved studying economics in school and even considered a PhD in econ, but I do not think I am cut out for a PhD, and also one of the main things that turned me off from econ is how impractical it is and how theoretical it is. Many of the economic models we studied in school have a limited basis in reality and are not practical to the work force. 

I have currently become really interested in data in general and the contrast it has to econ in general in that it is extremely practical and useful for business. (Speaking in broad generalizations, because obviously some empirical econ work/econometrics can in fact be very practical, but anyone who has studied econ seriously knows that it is a field that is by and large overly theoretical and detached from reality. 

I have decided to start self-studying ""data science"" or ""data analytics"". I do not know the exact definitions of these terms and am using them very loosely, but I basically mean I am studying statistics, data analysis, python, r, sql, data visualization, etc. I do not have a background in coding or computer science, but have done some self study in coding. I am by no means very knowledgeable with algorithms or modeling. My math background is also quite limited. I have studied through Calculus 1. 

My ultimate goal is to find a career that involves analysis/presentation of data in a way that is:

1) Meaningful/useful 

2) Fulfilling/satisfying (My job crunching basic expense numbers and reporting them up the chain of command to operations managers or higher level finance people was mind numbingly boring and unsatisfying. 

I am aware that many ""data science"" positions involve a lot of tedious work such as compiling and cleaning data, but as long as it has an end result that requires some analytical thought and analysis and has some fulfilling end product such as a useful and eloquent visualization or chart (or once more experienced - useful predictive model) then I will ultimately be fulfilled I believe. 

I know that I am at a disadvantage by not having a hard stem background or an advanced degree. I am open to the possibility of a masters degree. I would probably try to aim for a stats, data science, analytics, or possible CS masters, although I probably do not have the required pre-reqs for most programs. I did have a strong undergrad GPA in Econ. 

At the moment, my current plan is to self-study as much as possible and learn the basics that are valuable to an employer and could get me in the door in a data analytics type position. 

I am starting with a course called ""Data Science A-Z"" on Udemy based on this recommendation: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e

I am also re-working through a free intro to stats textbook to brush up on my statistics. Although it is all review since I took two Stats classes at University. 

I plan to learn some Python or R for data science next and begin to work on projects and keep tackling things such as SQL, linear algebra, brush up on calculus, etc, etc. 

Here are my questions for the people on this subreddit:

1. Am I on the right track with my self-study plan? Any suggestions/feedback?

2. How realistic is my ultimate goal/career plan? What are my possible end results based on my current educational background and self-study plan?

3. Should I pursue a masters degree and if so what degree? (I'm very opposed to paying thousands or tens of thousands for a degree unless the ROI is worth it.)

4. Will I forever be limited/relegated to basic data analytics positions with my non math/stats/CS formal background and no advanced degree? 

Please do not be afraid to be harsh or blunt with your feedback. I'm looking for realistic/pragmatic answers and advice based on my specific background. 

**TL;DR: Looking for helpful feedback regarding my specific personal situation. Thanks!**

I'm trying to better understand data warehouses and data marts by thinking about some examples for using both. But I'm struggling and I'd appreciate some help.

For data marts, I have: 

* Marketing. Analysis and reporting on marketing can use a data mart because this is a specific business-line that doesn't require enterprise-wide data. 

For data warehouse I have: 

* Profitability. To report on profitability at an insurance company, for example, a centralized warehouse that aggregates data from disparate sources within the company can be helpful. 

Are these examples remotely close to typical use cases for either of these things? Other examples would also be much appreciated.

For example, a doctor could very quickly ask such a search engine for the number of cancer patients who went to an ED department in 2015 - data we have but don't easily make available.

I have a wealth of experience in analysing data - from R to Process Mining - but very little hard coding knowledge.  Therefore, I can visualise how the data would need to be laid out to develop such a search engine, but lack the knowledge of what tools/code that would be required.  I've been researching NLP for the last few days, but don't think that's quite the same as what I'd be looking to implement.

As per one user's great advice from [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6x3z1y/aspiring_data_scientist_with_a_background_in/) about two weeks ago, I began my journey into ML and data science. I completed Andrew Ng's course on ML and found it extremely interesting. I loved every bit of it. I was on coursera every day, and completed everything in that course. It was very cool to go on Kaggle, read some tutorial kernals, and just find myself noting what the provider should have done differently as per Prof. Ng's advice. I feel like I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of some of the most basic and widely used ML algorithms today, and how to use them properly. 

I'd now like to contribute on Kaggle, but I really do not have the skills to do ML (or really any data science) in Python/R. Though I probably could mash up some code from some popular kernals, I really wouldn't know what I was doing, and so that would be pointless. I've discovered two courses (specializations) that focus [on deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#pricing) / [general data science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python#pricing) using Python, that seem pretty good. At this point, I'd like to learn Python over R.

Has anyone taken these courses? Does anyone have an opinion on what are some good ways to learn Python with data science? Sometimes I think I could be overcomplicating this, but I really don't think it's wise to jump into Kaggle, only to possibly burn myself out because I don't know Python. Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation and can help guide me? Again, I could just jump into the above two courses, but if anyone can help optimize my solution so that I start in a better direction, that would be huge! 

Thanks you, everyone! As it stands, my game plan is to get on Kaggle, build up a portfolio, and use that to help me land a job in the ML realm. I've actually found some interesting jobs that combine both my collegiate background with ML. Pretty neat.

1. What should I be doing on my own to make sure I am qualified for a more advanced data scientist role in the future?

Data originates as the result-sets of various methods of clinical testing *or* as a stream of continuous signals from connected hardware (connected to living things).

Stated broadly, you will have to receive the data, store that data, do (batch) work on that data to turn into meaningful, structured information, then run analyses and lots of statistical/machine learning and modeling on these datasets. You'll want to put the original data in some persistence layer where you can go back and reuse it (as source of truth) if your work elsewhere down the pipeline requires revision, and therefore your data needs reprocessing.

In your dream-setup, what technologies would you use? I'm talking about anything and everything you can think of from the database (influxDB, openTSDB, Druid, HBase?) to the languages you'd use (Julia, Python, R, Go?) and any of the libraries and frameworks you'd bake into your system to handle steps along the way. I imagine we'll be hearing from at least a few people about the wonderful ways in which things like AWS Lambdas can be helpful in a platform like this.

I've found lots of interesting material that deals with these ideas, but much of it is academic research that doesn't take modern tools or technologies into account. I'm not saying MATLab and MySQL are bad, but we're well past that.

(Hopefully this is the right place to post this. I found no other relevant posts on this sub)

I have a MSc in engineering, followed by 6 months of data science employment (which ended due to funding). I'm having trouble being considered for data science roles due to my non-CS background (I've been told this in multiple interviews, regardless of my portfolio).

Can anyone speak to the job prospects of [Waterloo's MMath Data Science course-work-only specialization](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-graduate-students/overview-degree-programs/master-mathematics-computer-science)*? More specifically, would it be better than say getting advanced analytics experience with one of the big consulting groups (IBM,Delloite...)? Ideally I would want to pursue datascience/ML work at (a) startup(s).

I have a data set with 12 feature variables (10 continuous and  two categorical -which are of interest but not relevant atm). I want to make no prior assumptions and cluster my 20k or so data points into distinct clusters and asses their in cluster variability and cluster to cluster distance (lets start with k means). However-I want to actually visually represent these suckers-and therefore want to do some PCA beforehand. But I'm a little concerned about how PCA will affect my decision boundaries and the variability between clusters and within them. So my questions are:

How common is it that you run pca before a k means cluster algorithm?

What should i keep in mind regarding how pca changes cluster assignment (other than the obvious change of variables which can transform data points in some pretty wonky ways)?

What does the extreme similiarity in the k means clustering and pca algorithms (have read they are almost equivalent up to some constraints) mean in the greater context of the problem?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


(Note: I'll come back and edit the formatting because it's probably terrible)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldnt have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&amp;nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelors in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a masters in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&amp;nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, dont be afraid to switch jobs when youre bored or its not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because theyre not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isnt really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldnt be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and its always good to mention how much data youve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you dont necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MITs Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edxs Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ngs Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldnt apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if youre leaning towards the development side.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and its where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes wont be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigans Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasnt too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portillas Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. Its how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesnt sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. Its also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasnt much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanfords Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ngs Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but its nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations dont care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured theyd like to see my what I do on the side. Ive been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, Im going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesnt have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what youve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because thats where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The resteh. Doesnt really matter.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- junior data scientist, data scientist, senior analytics, senior data analyst, junior machine learning, entry data science, and so on. When youre on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and cant sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating youre willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


Ive had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didnt require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


	What tools I used at work 


	How have I made processes more efficient at work


	Anything Ive automated 


	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


	Why the shift from the current job


	How much I know about their company and how Id describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest Ive had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didnt know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didnt feel complete. I couldnt afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didnt vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which Ill go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code worked, there was likely some test cases I didnt account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didnt follow through.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And youll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, youve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. Youll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadnt made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didnt prepare for questions theyd ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions Id ask them. This did two things: I didnt obsess about what theyd ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured theyd ask questions about how Id solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And thats exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since its a way of thinking youd have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, youll know what you did inside out, so its easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you dont have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:


VP of Data Science  


	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didnt want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.


	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because its what he was thinking too.

	*Hows your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. Id explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if theyd remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

	*Whats something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people


Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects theyre working on, whats the first thing Id be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.


VP tech  


	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, Im excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesnt exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something thats not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science Id like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

	*Cool man!*

He probably liked that I wasnt purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.


COO, president  


	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.


	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with Nothing? Not even selling lemonade?. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.


	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I wont be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that Im paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where Id be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and Im all for that. Im coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the finding meaning part.


	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 


	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldnt contain my excitement when I accomplished it.


Data scientists  


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.


VP Marketing (first form)- 


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 


	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasnt what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.


	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.


	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.


From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didnt get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.


CMO  


	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.


	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.


	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Havent experienced it before so Id have to learn how to operate within that structure.


	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say Im very helpful and available asap when he needs me.


	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.


	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job


	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldnt ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.


	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before


	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction its taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.


	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesnt know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.


After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.


VP Marketing (final form)-


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brains gears go overdrive.


	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.


	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I havent done it in practice. Couldnt answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.


	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.


	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ngs deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D


	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what Ive described here- that I felt useless after my masters, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.


I asked him:


	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


	Youve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. Id like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didnt want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like peace!


And that was that!


&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. Its hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, dont take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Dont let up!


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


Ill leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (Im not a fan of this explanation but Ive never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they dont offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. Its uncomfortable, youll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think theyll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. Its business. Its part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if youve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. Ill leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

And thats a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You dont have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. Its almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it wont stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldnt tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later theyre in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how youre gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	Youll stumble through a lot of material- and thats okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! Youll reach the aha! moment when everything clicks and you get it. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, its hard to know where to start and where to go. Ill summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if youre lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isnt counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. Youll burn out sometimes, and thats okay! If youre as driven and passionate as I was, youll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Quick start guide for data science:**

1.	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org
2.	Either:
o	Andrew Ngs Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)
o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)
3.	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

It might not be a technical fact related directly to data science, but still a pretty interesting read. In a way it shows how the application of one of the basic concept in statistics needs critical thinking:



*When the Air Force put Daniels to work measuring pilots, Daniels harbored a private conviction about averages that rejected almost a century of military design philosophy. As he sat in the Aero Medical Laboratory measuring hands, legs, waists, and foreheads, he kept asking himself the same question in his head: How many pilots really were average?*

*He decided to find out. Using the size data he had gathered from 4,063 pilots, Daniels calculated the average of the ten physical dimensions believed to be most relevant for design, including height, chest circumference, and sleeve length. These formed the dimensions of the average pilot, which Daniels generously defined as someone whose measurements were within the middle 30 percent of the range of values for each dimension. So, for example, even though the precise average height from the data was five foot nine, he defined the height of the average pilot as ranging from five seven to five eleven.*

*Next Daniels, compared each individual pilot, one by one, to the average pilot. Before he crunched his numbers, the consensus among his fellow air force researchers was that the vast majority of pilots would be within the average range on most dimensions. After all, these pilots had already been preselected because they appeared to be average sized. (If you were, say, six foot seven, you would never have been recruited in the first place.) The scientists also expected that a sizable number of pilots would be within the average range on all ten dimensions. But even Daniels was stunned when he tabulated the actual number.*


**Zero.**


*Out of 4,063 pilots, not a single airman fit within the average range on all ten dimensions. One pilot might have a longer-than-average arm length, but a shorter-than-average leg length. Another pilot might have a big chest but small hips. Even more astonishing, Daniels discovered that if you picked out just three of the ten dimensions of sizesay, neck circumference, thigh circumference, and wrist circumferenceless than 3.5 percent of pilots would be average sized on all three dimensions. Danielss findings were clear and incontrovertible. There was no such thing as an average pilot. If youve designed a cockpit to fit the average pilot, youve actually designed it to fit no one.*

This sub was very helpful in looking over my resume recently and pointing out some things to change. I believe that this helped me to land a job offer recently. Link to the post is as follows: https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6uelis/resume_critique_new_graduate_miscellaneous_career/

Its important to note that is has been only 1 month since I started looking and I have received 3 different offers and am currently finishing the interview process for 3 more companies. This is also my first real job out of college (just graduated from UCLA)!

So an LA media advertising firm made me an offer recently for the position of Junior Business Intelligence Analyst after telling me I didn't have enough experience for their regular Business Intelligence Analyst position, and while I am grateful for the offer, it seems on the low end.

The responsibilities of the role are generally to use SAS and SQL to consolidate data, developing BI dashboards for clients, build machine learning models for forecasting models from time series, testing the effects of marketing campaigns, etc.

The requirements were that I have a degree in Mathematics, Statistics or another quantitative field from a 4-year university, extensive programming experience, particularly in R, Python, and SAS, SQL skills, time series experience, and experience implementing machine learning models particularly on time series. I had all of these requirements on my resume except for SAS experience.

Compensation: 48,000/year (hourly with potential for overtime), average benefits (with 25% matching of up to 4% of 401k contributions)

I only say I think this is low because another offer I received from an insurance company for an assistant underwriter with 48k compensation and similar benefits where the only requirement was that I received a bachelor's degree from a university. The recruiter for this insurance company skirted around this number and even admitted to me that she thought it was low for the skills and experience I bring to the table, at least compared to Silicon Valley. I ultimately decided to not consider the offer since I didn't want to be an insurance underwriter!

Questions:

1. What is the best way to evaluate the offer?
2. Do you think this offer is reasonable based on entry level positions in the field?
3. I am going to graduate school in a year and naturally have not mentioned this to my employer. Do you think this type of work with this media advertising firm is beneficial before I return to school for a MS in Stats?
4. I fully intend to negotiate with them. Money is fortunately not an immediate issue for me. I don't think what they will end up offering is enough to warrant me to not consider the potential of other opportunities I am currently pursuing or continuing to look for another month. Should I still negotiate even if I don't end up wanting to take the final offer?
5. Continue to look?

I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, and I apologize in advance for any naivete on my part. This is all just very new to me!

Thanks for all the help that you can provide me once more!",16,2,False,self,,,,,

About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  

I started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!

With my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.

Up until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.

After updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  

I quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!  My biggest problem now is deciding what to do if I receive multiple offers but that is definitely a good problem to have.  I would have never thought I would be in this situation but it helps to know that it can happen to anyone so don't give up chasing your passions!

I hope my story can serve as a little bit of inspiration to anyone else out there looking to make a career change, it's never too late!

Bored of my current job, wanted a career change
Took some online courses to learn Python, R, and SQL
Created pretty resume
Applied to every job under the sun

I'll start off by saying I enrolled in a data analysis boot camp with a company that gets rated really well in terms of boot camps. This all started in around May. The class was supposed to start August 15th. It got pushed back and was supposed to start September 25th. So this week I contact them, since they said they would contact me and never did; suddenly they are saying the class is getting pushed back a few months and they're changing the days of the class so that I can not even attend. This was the first I was hearing of any of this and no one even thought to notify me or discuss any of the changes with me. Needless to say I asked for my money back.

So now I'm back at square one. I have a research background (M.S. in marine science) and am very familiar with most advanced math and statistics. I'm just looking for any advice that anyone can give me on how to get into teaching myself the things necessary to get into data analysis since my original plan fell through. I did buy a series of O'reilly books and have been going through them. But I'd be really grateful if anyone could give me some advice; especially maybe anyone that has taught themselves.

Im very comfortable for data, research, and analysis as Ive always found those types of projects wherever Ive been.  Fast forward a few years and a few kids, Ive decided Im ready for the official change into Data, whatever that may be as the titles change daily it seems.  The ultimate goal is to be the f*n man that pulls mind-blowing value from data and saves the company millions.

Ive read some books and taken a few classes on Udemy (SQL, Python, R, MS Access), and its obvious I still have a long way to go before achieving strength in all areas.  Although I must say its coming along nicely, and most of all I love the process.  This work is energizing.

Im happy in my current role which is a mix of business analysis, process improvement, and reporting.  Recently I lost an opportunity to join a BI team, and now Im at a crossroads of deciding the appropriate steps to make this happen.  The rejection was brutal, and Ive digested it as well as I ever will.  My thoughts have led me to two likely conclusions: it wasnt meant to be for me in BI/Data at my current company and I need to carve out my own path that ultimately leads to kick-ass Data Analysis/Science albeit circumventing the BI route, or I polish up my skills and prepare to leave the company.  Everything is on the table, and Im prepared to dedicate my entire existence to this career.  Its unclear to me what has the most value, or what combination of skills/training/creds will best tee me up for this career.

From my current position I struggle to prioritize the following:

1.	**Online classes out the ass (edX, Udemy, Coursera) and in what order?**  Data Science, BI, Python, R, SQL, UX, Machine Learning, or Visualization (Tableua or Power BI?)
2.	**Formal classes (this is tough, only have one go and were talking big $/time commitment)** - MS in Statistics, or MS in any of the new Data Analytics programs OR Certificate in Data Analysis (would prefer just going for the masters instead)
3.	**Domain Knowledge / Other Certifications** - PMP, Six Sigma, SCRUM, AGILE, any of these worthwhile?

Personally I feel it's either going straight for the master's immediately, or pushing it off and knocking out as many MOOC classes and work projects as I can.  Then knock out the master's to kick it up to the next level.

Risks

1.	Time: Im not ancient but Im no recent grad.  Mid-30s.  Having a strong gameplan is critical.
2.	Money: Im able to purchase one masters program from a standard school, nothing crazy.

What Id love from you is any guidance or perspective that will help me prioritize and attack the situation ahead of me.  I've seen the success on this board, and I want some of that action.  I know this field is rapidly evolving and technology will likely kill many tools and processes we use today.

Just checking what methods I should be looking at.  


Have a set of numerical data, after cleaning nulls and bad reads have 500 cols x 90,000 rows, with a nominal setpoint column, plant feed rate and 498 other columns of varying relevance.

nb: The setpoint should result in the plant feedrate, subject to the plant response to 498 other columns of input.

set point is input.  


498 other columns are input (some will be autoresponding to internal signals, ie: pump turns off when tank is empty or full)  

plant feedrate is output.   


Looking at the charts it's reasonably obvious the actual feed rate lags the setpoint by some time period. Shortlisting the high correlation data points also indicates a time lag, the time lag varies with some columns (data is from an industrial process plant and time delays due to retention, transport delays etc between instrumentation on pumps, tanks, conveyors etc is to be expected.

While I have some methods I've used to cater for this, they are crude and custom rolled, also tedious to implement.

I suspect the methods used in share price prediction will be similar, likely other fields have developed similar methods.

Currently, I'm also studying Algorithms and Complexity Analysis and want to complete a second bachelor's in Statistics over 3 semesters before applying to Data Mining or Computational Statistics Master's. I'm thinking of using the bachelors to study Machine Learning, deep math behind categorical/multivariate methods and programming in C++, R, Python, SQL, Tableau, HADOOP etc over 2 years in addition to the degree.

Then comes a Master's in Data Mining from UCF...or should I shoot for a better school with this background even though I have no income and will be independent after my second bachelor's (commuting from home)? During the Master's and a bit before is when I'd start participating in Kaggle competitions and continuing to learn the above languages.

I have no job experience, but should I not apply for internships until my Master's degree simply because there's so much I want to do? I have a strong tendency to think that I can do too much (eyes bigger than stomach)

Because it's a very hot field, naturally various boot camps and MOOCs have popped up, all offering courses in DS / ML / AI...but you might ask yourself ""Will the courses teach me what I need, or do I really need to spend 5 - 9 years at some University?""

Well, here are my thoughts (FWIW, I have a Masters in Applied Physics - Machine Learning): 

**1.** Even though many of the techniques are fairly old, the Data Science field itself is pretty young. Because of this, not many (educational) institutes have been offering any official or streamlined program towards DS. Hence why so many applicants come from slightly-related fields, where the same techniques are applied. 

Because of the above, many schools do not offer DS / ML / AI before Graduate School - and even then, you're just scratching the surface. You learn the bare basics, and won't really get to touch the cool or recent stuff before you start on a Ph. D 

This, in effect, creates a very large pool of applicants that hold a Masters or Ph.D 

**2.** The field is expanding rapidly, and some techniques or research areas (Deep Learning, for example) are quite recent. Because of the pace, you really do want applicants that can 

A) Fluently read research papers 

B) Convert ideas from research papers into working code  

C) Potentially own research

Because research papers are written by researchers, for researchers, they are also quite dense to read. In short, you need to know the language (at times advanced Math and Engineering), and you need to know it quite fluently. 

If you're a Ph.D, it's a good indicator that you're excellent at that. Scientists read research papers / literature all day. 

**Notes** 

With that said...DS / ML are hot buzzwords, and many companies deal with quite trivial problems. Many of these jobs can absolutely be done without problem, just by doing short-term self-study, and knowing a bit of this and a bit of that. There are many ""ABC"" study guides floating around here, listing up all the fundamentals. 

However, if you want to work as a scientist / researcher, and want be on the forefront of things / cutting edge, I would advise you to seek a higher education. Whichever way you slice it, you need rigorous experience. 

The **TL;DR** 

- Not many Universities offer stand-alone DS / ML programs, and many of the DS / ML programs are part of a Masters Degree specialization, and then a Ph.D program / research group

- Because of that, many applicants and candidates hold a Masters or Ph.D - So you get a kind of inflation in the Degree level. 

- Research in some areas move fast, so you need to have some researcher skills to keep up - like reading research literature quite seamlessly. Academic (or other) research background will help you at this. 

**End notes** 

I predict that in 10-15 years, there will be more undergrad ""specialized"" jobs in DS or ML, simply because more schools will be offering said undergrad programs. I know that schools all over are doing everything they can to open programs like that, because of the high demand from both industry and students. ",20,4,False,self,,,,,

Hi Reddit! I'm turning to you in my hour of need and looking for harsh, cold honesty.

I finished an accelerated Master's program in statistics in May and probably applied to 1,000+ jobs over the summer; changed my resume at least four times, including getting a professional re-write; reached out to tons of people through connections and got internal referrals.

From all of this, I got three call-backs, with eventual rejections. So, at this point, I'm asking if I'm even employable in data analytics.

I am a carreer-switcher, with background in law. My BA was in humanities. But I found myself constantly being put in charge of technical and analytical projects and ended up deciding that data science was a better career for me. 

My Master's program was very intense and I did well. I now know R and Statistics quite well for data munging, analysis, and visualization. I self-taught myself SQL, Python, and now, Tableau. I have many good ""tidy datasets"" projects I showcase on my resume from school and I have exposure to extremely ""un-tidy"" text-based data and business data from my years in law. I have never been an analyst, but I make sure to show that the work I did was mostly analytical, including business analysis in Excel and querying data using legal database management tools.

Obviously, I have a non-traditional background for a data analyst, but with the amount of time I put in, I was hoping to get some interests by now. Recruiters and connections don't reply to me 90% of the time.

I just want to know at this point, is this a lost cause? Should I give up and go back to law? I like data science and I can lead a project from data ingest to conclusion to get insights. I have a scientific mind that's just rotting away in an administrative role. So, it would suck to give up. But I have loans that are due and no health insurance and I need to get real. So, get real with me, reddit. Any advice, tips for open positions, and harsh realities are appreciated.",86,66,False,self,,,,,

A dilemma that many of you may have faced and overcome.

First a little information about me. I graduated college in 2016 with a BS in ChemE and have been working full time as a process engineer since then. For all intents and purposes I have no background in programming or advanced statistics. After realizing how fun, versatile and lucrative a career in data science can be, I've decided to make a career switch into the field. 

Now, I've been slowly self learning and over the past year and I've managed to teach myself some Python and R, but I'm still missing out on other things like SQL,Tableau,etc. I figured that with enough time and practice I can get a hang of the programming aspect of DS. But it's been very difficult for me to learn HOW to actually understand, interpret and analyze the data I am working with. And for that I strongly believe that I would need the guidance of a teacher. That's why I've been strongly considering pursuing either a MS in DS or paying for bootcamps.

I live in Chicago and Northwestern university has a great MS program for analytics ( http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/overview/ ) as well as 24 week part time coding bootcamp( https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu ). I strongly believe that both of these programs will give me the skills and guidance I need to get establish a career in DS.(please correct me if this assumption is incorrect)

The way I'm looking at things now is, do the part time bootcamp while working fulltime(its more affordable that way), apply for jobs(hopefully land one successfully), work for a year or two saving up some money, and then apply for the MS in DS.

Is this a good idea or am I just wasting my resources and effort with the bootcamp? Or is there another option I haven't even considered?

I have a large data set of peoples actions, which I can supplement with additional information on how those people are connected. Each action has attributes such as person, type, extremity and time of occurrence. So an action might look like Bill A., Yawn, Loud, Apr 1st 2016 1230. There are an enormous number (1000+) of different action types and 10's of thousands of different people.

My objective is to identify which actions are connected to each other. So for example if every single time a Father yawns, his daughter yawns too, you might consider that connected. While maybe only 10% of the time when a Mother yawns the son yawns too, these might not be considered related types of events.

tl;dr: Recent grad looking for a data analyst position, some interviews but no success. Need advice on strategizing my job search and resume (and maybe interviewing too). Thanks!

(Resume Link: https://imgur.com/a/vM1Fa)

I graduated with an undergrad degree in May with a degree in  Economics and two minors in CS and Stats. I'm aspiring to become a data scientist but I realize that right now I need to find a data analyst job because this is what I'm most qualified for and it would be a good starting point to build my skill set and eventually become a data scientist.

However, up to now I haven't had too much luck with my job search. I get some phone interviews and then a bunch of second or maybe even third round interviews, and I got to the final round of a interview process with a data consultancy once, but nothing has worked out yet and I'm not sure if my hit-rate for hearing back after throwing my resume out there is good enough. I've probably sent out ~200 applications or so but I haven't been customizing cover letters much besides names and minor changes. 

Recently I've been trying to focus more on reaching out to people on linkedin for informational interviews and career advice and I'm working on setting up a personal blog/site to put up small projects on which would act as a portfolio. While I've gotten a lot of good advice from phone calls with data scientist (not to be underestimated), it hasn't really helped me in getting a job in a direct way.

Given my experience through internships and my technical skills, I thought I would have a bit of an easier time finding a data analyst job - I like to think I'm a solid interviewer most of the time too. It's been about 4 months now and I'm starting to feel a bit desperate and at a loss for what I'm doing wrong. Any critiques, advice, or feedback would be much appreciated. 

I also just remade my resume after wondering if my previous resume was putting me in the throwaway pile and I'd love to get some critique (my previous resume was was more unconventional/creative). The resolution may be a little low in the screenshot, it isn't like that in the PDF form.

Hopefully some of this discussion also helps other recent grads in my position who are lurking around here as well. Sorry for the wall of text.

My challenge now is different. The company is not data-driven at all, marketing does not track the effectiveness of social media, campaigns, emails into business results and I'm NOT on a mission to change the culture, but just to make sure my work is valuable and causes an impact.

I was responsible for redesigning the website for my new company and it was really bad from a content and design perspective (didn't really sell well the strengths of the software). My boss was against tracking results on this website because he feels that people buy this product regardless of the content on the website. It's a desktop software similar to Autocad and people buy because they need for their work, so he feels that people compare the product by talking to coworkers in the industry and buys based on features or what the industry is using. However, I have a hypothesis that the redesign could do some sort of impact in the sales or conversion.

I convinced him that doing a basic tracking to see the impact on sales and conversion would be nice, it would look good for the CEO and business people if we caused a good impact. If nothing good happens it's cool because nobody is expecting these numbers.

This is the process of buying the product:

(homepage or product page) - &gt; (goes to another subsite with online store) - &gt; (login) - &gt; (adds to the cart product version) - &gt; (checkout).

Note: we didn't touch the online store at all which is a separate website

Question: If you don't have a lot of analytical historical data, but just sales data in a spreadsheet, what would be the best way to create a ""Framework"" to analyze the impact?

I know they have google analytics installed on both properties, but they never did the setup properly, with filters and never used any data. I don't like G.A. myself because I've worked in other teams and it's very tricky to match numbers, and again goals with $$ numbers were never created in G.A. anyway, all the sales data is in our CRM.

I was going to install Hotjar and create a simple conversion rate funnel from the website to the final step in the purchase (linking the store with the WordPress website) or maybe some sort of check on sales data to see any spikes.

Any advice?

How do you manage your projects in a corporate setting where multiple folks collaborate on a single project?  

Where are current doing ""a folder per project"" on a network drive. There, you find the following subfolders :   
  
- a ""data/raw"" subfolder, where we put the raw data, shapefile, etc..  
- a  ""git"" folder for each collaborator  (git-username1, git-username2, etc..)  to clone the repo and work on the code.  That subfolder is built similar to [cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).    The main difference is that we don't put the raw data there, because we don't want to create a copy of the data for each collaborator and we don't want to check it into git.   When we need to refer to the data, we'll refer to ""/../data/raw/""  

there are also some extra folders such as  

- ""mandate"" , where we put what is the goal of this project, who asked for it, what is the delivery date, etc..
- ""litterature"" where we put pdfs from relevant book chapters, articles, blog posts, etc..

This works fine as long as the project is ""on going"".  When we will be done, we will delete all the ""git"" folders and simply leave a URL shortcut to the git repo so that someone can clone the latest version when needed.

If someone needs to take over the project a year from now, they will need two separate places:  
a) git repo for the code  
b) data/raw folder  
  
I feel the code is safe on the internal git repo, but I'm  afraid for the data.  A well intentioned person could move or delete the data folder.    Worse, someone could edit the data without meaning to do it (I'm looking at you excel).  

Also, it is kind of an hassle while sharing projects between teams because we will have to ask IT to provide access to two different places (git AND data) instead of just one.

How do folks do it?  The datascience cookiecutter mentions the following:   
  
- AWS S3 with a syncing tool
- Git large file storage
- Git annex
- Dat

This is corporate data, so we don't want to put it just anywhere. 

thanks

Hoping you can share some insight into what the data science jobs market looks like in Canada. 

I'm weighing up my career options at the min and want to see how well established the market is there and what the next 10-20 years might look like there for the data industry.

Specifically, my question is geared more towards **data analytics and modelling** side of things rather than data architecture and management side of things.

 Is the Canadian jobs market similar to that in the US, both in how advanced it is, how competitive the market is?

 What salary vs experience relationship can one expect?

 Same questions as above but compared to the UK

 Are there any specific hubs/cities that have a strong focus towards the industry in Canada?

 Are there any specific industries in data science that people tend to focus on there? Insurance, Finance, Telecoms, Consumer, ... ?

If you have any links/resources you can share on the data market in Canada that could help my search I'd really appreciate them, thanks Reddit.

I am coming from a security/medic/firefighter background, so noooooo coding experience.  

I understand/am trying to give about 12 hours to commit to studying, practicing, trying python and it's coding assignments we are taught each day.  I'm still not 100% embracing it but I believe with persistence I'll get it.
