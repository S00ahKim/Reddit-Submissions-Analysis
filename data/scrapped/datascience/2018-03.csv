I hope this post is in the right place!

Over the past six months my academic team has been building a ""one button machine"" for feature engineering on SQL Server. As our research comes to a close, we have been considering an open source release. The purpose of this post is to gauge community interest of such an open source release.


So, a little about the one button machine.

* The system is built on Java, Python, and Prolog.
* The system targets SQL Server, but extending to support different db technologies is a quick and easy process.
* Set up can be as simple as enumerating the relationships in your database.
* The system creates features up to 3 tables in depth.
* Features are identified based on correlation to the dependent column. Features with the highest correlation to the dependent are selected, while others in the same cluster are discarded.
* A feature matrix file is generated and passed into a python script, which performs logistic regression and generates a report.

Please indicate if you would be interested in the open source release of such a project.

I have data for a span of 6 months and I want to be able to predict whether or not a user will churn in the next x amount of months. I have both static (demographic) and dynamic (transaction) panel data. My approach here is to split this 6 months into three groups of two months each. I would then train on the first group (month 1 and 2) for which I have derived my target variable by analysis if the same users in group 1 were active/inactive in month 3 and 4. Once I have a trained model, I would test them on group 2, for which the prediction will be if the group 2 members stay active/inactive on month 5 and 6. Following which, I can evaluate my predictions against the ground truth definition which would be if they actually stayed active or inactive.

The task at hand is to classify the nutrition within each household. I had a thought that I could use clustering to determine some clear cut healthy vs unhealthy households, then use those classifications to train a more granular model (decision tree?) that could score households between the extremes.

Really keen to hear what people think.

EDIT: I am hoping to get a granular nutrition score rather than a binary healthy/unhealthy response. Perhaps the probability of being healthy would be a good measure to use ?",7,7

Found an interesting post on where Amazon might want to place its next headquarters. They used Stack Overflow user profiles to understand what developers are like in different cities and compared them to find the most similar in terms of different skillsets.

There is a tl;dr at the bottom of the blog post but I'll copy and paste it here.

* These large cities and metro areas in the United States are quite similar to each other, especially compared to worldwide variation, and its unlikely that any would be a truly bad choice.

* The choices that are most similar overall to Seattle in terms of technology ecosystems are Northern VA and Washington, DC. If Amazon wants to go with a city where the developer population feels as familiar as possible, these would be the way to go.

* If Amazon wants to choose a city with proportionally more mobile developers, Los Angeles, New York, and Toronto would be the best choices.

* If Amazon wants to choose a city with proportionally more developers working in data science and machine learning, Raleigh or Columbus would be excellent choices.

I'm trying to understand how sklearn's support vector regression (not classifier) works. I understand the basics of SVM - using the kernel trick to project vector space data into feature space and modeling a hyperplane that minimizes cost function and maximizes distance between it and the support vectors. I get that.

What I don't get is how that approach is used to produce a regression. Is it essentially a linear regression but using the kernel trick? How does the hyperplane come into it? Is that the equivalent of the line in a 2d linear regression except in 3+ dimensions? What is epsilon??

There is surprisingly little on how SVM works in regressions.

My idea is as follows:
* graph every column against the target variable (isDoesSport) and spot correlations by eye
* normalise every variable to (-1, 1) and train logistic regression. The variable with the biggest weight is the most important.
* put everything as it is, into a decision tree. The top nodes indicate the most important predictors.

Am I missing something here?

If the task was to simply predict a new person's propensity to do sport, I would put it in a Random Forest, and probably get greater accuracy. However in my case I'd like to make a human readable report that can be used by politicians. Are there more sophisticated options than the three I described?

This subreddit was really helpful when I was evaluating offers 6 months ago and I think your advice would be great again! Linked to the previous post and advice: https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/71kzy1/entry_level_job_offer_help_evaluating/

So another company reached out to me for a new role. Below I will describe my current role and details about the new role.

Current Role:

* Location: Bay Area
* Industry: Public Policy
* Salary: $50,000
* Vacation: 2 weeks PTO + very flexible Work From Home policy
* Benefits: Essentially nothing? (pay my own healthcare, commute costs, 401k (no matching), no stock/equity).
* Day-to-Day: Mostly data cleaning in R and Python, creating visualizations, implementing machine learning models and in particular NLP models.

Offered Role:

* Location: Bay Area
* Industry: Tech
* Company Stage: Nearly a year Post Series A (raised $50+ million)
* Salary: $75,000
* Equity: 7500 options, 25% vest after 1 year, 4-year total vesting schedule
* Vacation: Unlimited PTO (yeah right lol)
* Benefits: Company paid health premiums (medical, vision, dental), free food, $500 Bike credit, 401k (but no match). 
* Day-to-Day: 60% customer support / interactions, 40% other things as needed but vague on details (mentioned they were interested in my analytics background but they just recently hired a head of data science so no fleshed-out team yet)

This is not an initially analytics role, but may morph into one. The company's entire foundation is based on using machine learning and data science, but right now more on the machine learning aspect. They say I should be prepared to be at the company working in a customer-focused position for a year before they would transition me to a full analytics role, but that since they are growing so fast, they don't exactly know if it would be sooner or later than that.

Other Comments:

* Current employer will definitely not negotiate.
* Already negotiated current offer to 75,000.

Main Thoughts:

* I want to save more money for graduate school if I go that route in the future.
* Unsure if abandoning a role where I use data science in my day-to-day for this role is a good idea if I want to pursue data analytics more in depth in the future.
* This is a substantial pay raise for me, and more in line with living costs in the Bay Area.
* I could potentially move up quicker than in a large established company.
* Worried how employers would view me if I try to jump to another analytics position in the future, after I essentially left an analytics position.
* This seems like a great offer to me for a recent grad, for a non-technical position.
* I get the startup experience, which might make it easier for startups to take a chance on me in the future.

Thoughts?

Thanks in advance! :)",13,3

Messages are just C++ classes whose members store data. Data can be ints, enums, double, strings, structs, arrays of structs, and vectors.

Currently we log everything in a big csv. The first column is message type then the fields. The first time we log a message we log the headers. This allows us to use grep to get a specific message type out and then read the data in using numpy/pandas or matlab.

I'm starting to think about exploring other options. One problem we have right now is that we do sets of monte carlo runs. A single set can be 100 - 250 runs, but we'll do like 50 of them. Often time questions will arise like which runs from each set had a message with this field set to this value. Right now I have to write a script each time to answer this question. It usually involves traversing the run directory, calling grep on each monte carlo run log, reading the data in with pandas, then doing filtering, and storing the result in another csv.

I was considering logging to a sqlite database instead. There would be one table for each message type and then maybe a table listing the order of messages. This would allow us to build a generic framework for doing queries and then we could just use sql to actually do them instead of having one off scripts.

Alternatively, I've read that [hdf5 is more efficient than sqlite](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282986584_Efficient_Management_of_Big_Datasets_Using_HDF_and_SQLite_A_Comparative_Study_Based_on_Building_Simulation_Data).

I am hoping someone can help me with fitting a Zero One Inflated Beta Regression model in R.

I am dealing with a dataset that has a response variable that is a ratio. However, it also has alot of 0's and 1's. The histogram of the response variable in my data looks like the following: https://imgur.com/XDdNN1l

After doing research online, it looks like a Zero One Inflated Beta Regression model is my best bet. It looks like the best way to do this is using the gamlss package in r, but I've been having trouble understanding how it works. 

I've done something along these lines:
m1 &lt;- gamlss(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, family = BEINF, data = na.omit(data))

But performance ends up being poor. I don't quite understand how the function is working. This is a bit of a longshot, but anyone have tips on what I might be doing wrong, or where to go from here?

Thanks in advance

Here is how I normally deal with it, and I'm looking for other best practices or resources or other ways of doing it that are better. 

1. Write functions that interface with the API, download the data, and return the data in a dataframe-like object. Allow function to accept command line arguments with an option to rebuild the database (re-download everything) or just download the latest data. 

2. Use a small Amazon EC2 instance and schedule the data download using bash scripts and cron jobs. 

3. Save the data to Amazon RDS. 

4. Set up logging and a Slackbot that scans the logs for errors using regex also using cron jobs and generates notifications in Slack if necessary. 

I'm interested in feedback: 

1. Is this a good process? 

2. What technologies or tools am I missing that could make this better? 

3. How do you guys deal with error notifications, upstream and downstream dependencies, API instability and making sure the database can recover from API failures or the production instance being down? 

4. Are there any recommended books or resources to learn more about these best practices?

Can anyone share their experience or suggest papers on the subject? My background is in risk and probability theory, so NLP is fairly new to me. I have outlined my current approach below. 

For example, I may have a list of 500,000 human names with duplicates. However, this may contain: common names and spelling mistakes (e.g. John Smith = Jhon SMith, Jon Smth); nicknames (e.g. Andrew = andy), and surnames from multiple territories e.g. Greek, Russian, and Chinese.  

My current approach follows:
1. standardizing the name fields (lowercase, strip white space, remove non-alphabetical chars).

2. I use several online dictionaries to map nicknames to common names e.g https://github.com/carltonnorthern/nickname-and-diminutive-names-lookup

3. I use Levenstein edit-distance and a corpus of correct first and surnames to map incorrect spellings to correct ones.

4. If I know one person is associated with another field (e.g. an address) I use that information to group the different variations of the names. E.g. If I know that ""Adrian Smith"" lives at ""1 Privat Drive, england"", I will use that information to merge all the names like ""adrain smith"" if they have an address like ""1 privat drive, england"" together again using edit-distance. 

The above steps provide an improvement on the raw data, but looking for suggestions or alternatives. 

Many thanks  ",2,7

*Big data*    
The course will touch the following subjects: Novel programming frameworks for big data, processing: theory and practice, Algorithmic solutions with focus on large inputs, MapReduce, Apache Spark, Clustering primitives, Graph analysis primitives, Data stream processing. Probably we'll be using python rather than Java/Scala.

*Human data analytics*    
Core subjects are: Dimensionality reduction with PCA, Clustering: K-means - SOM - GNG, Modeling times series: HMM, Neural networks: Feed Forward, Convolutional. The applications would be mainly in Modeling ECG signals, Speech/face recognition, Inertial signals.

I've always associated MapReduce and related skills more to a big data engineer position (which I'm not really interested in) rather than a data scientist one.

Do you have any suggestion on which course would be the most beneficial? Unluckily I won't be able to attend both of them so the goal would be to follow the one that would give me greater benefit when I'll be looking for a job.

I've had two primary roles as a Data Analyst over the past three years. First as a Health IT Analyst writing SQL for ad-hoc reports, and most recently as a Data Analyst for a Digital Marketing agency using Google Cloud Platform to report on clients' marketing performance. I primarily use SQL to aggregate data, Python for API calls and data cleansing, and Linux shell scripts in this role. 

I'm currently looking at getting an online Master's degree and have been looking primarily at Georgia Tech online, mostly due to it's low cost and quality offerings. The main question is, [OMS in Computer Science](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) or [OMS in Analytics](https://analytics.gatech.edu/)? 

I have a BBA in Economics, but have really enjoyed coding to the extent that I have done it, however i'm not confident that i'll ever be good enough / will want to be a full blown developer. I am interested in the OMS CS degree as it would hopefully teach me Computer Science principles that I did not get in Undergrad, but will lend themselves to best practices and innovation in pursuit of a Data Scientist or Data Engineer career track. 

The OMS in Analytics seems like it would almost be CS-lite, which 1) seems more attainable to me having not had a CS background, but 2) also concerns me that I will not get enough CS exposure to be able to develop ML models, data ingestion pipelines, etc. 

I'd greatly appreciate your input and/or feedback on these programs if anyone has experience.

We have a dispatcher who is in charge of executing the schedule on a day-to-day basis. Our largest reason for cancellations/incomplete is due to weather (some jobs can only be done in good weather). However, when weather strikes, our dispatcher does a pretty good job of moving the pieces around to maximize how many jobs we can do. I am trying to quantify the impact our dispatcher has by looking at the data for days she was present vs. days she takes off. The problem I am encountering is that she often looks at the weather, determines she won't be able to get much done (if it's really bad) and takes the majority of her days off on these bad weather days.

I have tried looking at sick days instead of vacation days as these would be more randomly distributed but it turns out only has taken one sick day in all the data I have. I have also tried to just throw out the WX cancels/incompletes, but re-arranging the schedule on WX days is a lot of what she does.

Can anyone offer some suggestions for ways I might control for her self-selecting days that would have a high cancellation rate whether she comes in or not?",5,6

174,2018-3-7,2018,3,7,11,82komd,Recommended lightweight ETL tools and resources for learning about ETL best practices? (Python),https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/82komd/recommended_lightweight_etl_tools_and_resources/,pybokeh,1520388286,"Hello, I'm a senior data analyst at an automotive company with an industrial engineering background.  I've been using Python lately as a ""glue"" tool or I guess as a small scale, custom ETL engine, whereby I am extracting data from disparate sources (multiple different database servers, local flat files, and data from web api) using turbodbc (to connect to different db servers), pandas (data transformations, cleaning, merging, etc), and requests (extracting data from web).  Then bringing them all together in an organized fashion, cleaning, transforming data, and then ultimately storing the data in a database.  It has worked out well.  But I've been reading about Luigi and Airflow, but see right away they seem overkill for my purposes (or maybe not?) as they seem to imply they work easily with big data stack like Hadoop, Hive, Pig, etc.  They have a host of features that I'm pretty sure I will only probably need to use like 1% of the features.  I am also not sure if I need to use an ETL framework at all even for what I am doing.  The reason I am not sure is because I do not have formal data engineering knowledge or ETL knowledge and so I do not know what I may be missing or not doing properly to make my script more robust and reliable.  Basically, at my company, we have a need to obtain data, clean, transform it, and then store it.  That's it.  This needs to be done once a month.  The databases I am pulling data from are your standard relational databases (DB2 UDB and SQL Server).  They contain 10s of millions of rows, but most of my intermediary result sets fit comfortably in RAM. and in one part of my script, I do have to resort to chunking at 20K rows at a time.  But my final data set that I then need to store/insert into a database is only in the thousands of rows, once a month.  So nothing special or extreme for what I need to do.  I figure if I ever do hit memory limits, I can then perhaps use Dask since I do not have a good working relationship with my company's IT group for them to assist me with setting up with big data tools.

I have created my prototype script in Jupyter notebook and then plan on finalizing it as a regular .py in its current procedural-based form.  I have to then potentially apply or extend this same code base to other uses and therefore, I think I may need to eventually convert it to be OOP-based code base, but not sure.  Maybe by then I'll be inadvertently creating my own ""framework""?!

I'm not sure what exactly I am looking for in an ETL framework.  I currently have just functions, some simple, some not so simple, for sake of simplicity, generically named like getData(), transformData(), transformColumnA(), insertData() etc.  I would like the framework to test if a column or data is good or alert me for when something is wrong or missing from my data.  My script currently handles these situations with custom code and print statements.  Maybe what I'm looking for is like a testing framework like pytest but for ETL processes?!

So bottom line is, I would like to know what resources are there for me learn more about ETL, ETL best practices, and if there are any lightweight, Python-based ETL tools (preferable ones that work well with Pandas) I could look into based on my description above.  Thanks!.",3,0

Yet there has been no such thing at all and it's been 5 years since the hype cycle began. The inherent problem with DS is that it will always be a niche career that will never scale. You need hundreds of software engineers front and back end to keep your app running but you only need 2-3 to keep your ML pipelines running and being innovated on.  That will mean this will never translate into a big career with a lot of opportunity except for the very best.

At to that the glaring problem that all the advances in ML recently are in Object recognition stuff which for most companies is of limited use. It's cool if you wanna build self driving cars or chat bots but 99% of employers don't care about any of this. The use cases for ML at a retail consumer company are the same boring standard stuff we were doing as far back as the early 00s under the old school title of Statistician/Quant Analyst.

Do you agree or disagree?

Edit: These are some real numbers. Huge Tech organization with multi billion dollar revenue. 500 software engineers. 100 data engineers. 50 Product Managers. ~30 Analytics/Analysts. 5-7 Data Scientists. Go figure.

They are the original statisticians and so similar to DS. For almost 100 years, they have managed to keep their profession prestigious and salaries very high and you won't find too many unemployed actuaries or actuarial students unable to find jobs(unlike the state of DS right now)? How so? 

By controlling the volume of talent and supply, and by ensuring that the few people that made past their checks were actually provided support and mentorship and didn't just fall through the cracks. 

And how did they achieve this? Not by inflating credentials so that you needed to get a PhD, 10 startup projects and a Kaggle grandmaster ranking just so you can call scikit learn on a random forest and write a left join in sql. Not by going to some garbage bootcamp for 3 months that teaches you the above in the worst possible way. Stuff like that can be done by anyone out of college. 

Actuaries achieved did this by having:

1) a rigorous but ultimately fair, transparent and democratic process for entering the profession through the establishment of very difficult exams. These exams alone require tons of self study, good college prep, and a lot of commitment but anyone is welcome to take them. No one is stopping you. In essence, it keeps out the bandwagoners and prevents supply from inflating by ensuring only a few % will meet the bar. And if you don't get a job you know why. It's because you couldn't pass the exam.

Compare that to DS which has no quality control but more importantly is not a fair and transparent process to anyone trying to break enter. Why should the college kid be asked to get a PhD to call scikit learn on a CLV model or create dashboards?? Why is company A allowed to only interviews PhDs but Company B doesn't give a shit about if you have a PhD or not? So confusing.

2) perfecting the apprenticeship trainee model. They took ambitious hungry kids out of college and gave them good paying jobs at insurance and consulting companies with the promise of a greater paycheck if they completed training. Essentially they get cheap labor to mentor and after 2 years that labor is perfect for their needs. Win win.

Being an actuary is not that hard. It's again college level stats and data cleansing for the most part but it requires a clearly defined path you need to follow. 

You can extend this argument and process also to audit, law, investment banking, doctors etc. Again solid professions that have held the test of time but which all have a clear and rigorous path you need to follow.

You can learn everything on law or medicine from books or online today but you're still not a doctor or lawyer even if you did 100 MOOCs on the topic.

Project. 

&amp;nbsp;

I would also like to ask you which you would drop if you had to drop one of them.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, here are some alternatives courses (they're not related to data science), would you recommend one of these instead?

* Advanced Program Design with C++
* Computer Graphics

So Im currently creating a predictive model for a hockey analytics WAR based stat, and I want to include coaching effects. I know how to input the coaches and if every season a player only had one coach this wouldnt be hard, but I have to find a way to create a value out of the coach, and then use those values to add to the players contributions. For example, say I have 2 coaches, and a bunch of players played under just one of them, but 2 were traded for each other, one played 70/30 with coach 1, one played 70/30 with coach 2. How do I create a value for coach 1 and 2, and then give the players the value proportional to how much they played with each coach. Id like to be able to include them in the training as well, but even if I have to exclude the players with more than 1 coach in a season just to train a model, I still dont know how I could apply said model to any player that has had 2 coaches. Is there a way to work these inputs to make it work, or some feature Im not thinking of that can work around this? Any help would be appreciated, Im still fairly new to this. (Also, I cant get the player data separated for their times with different coaches, so thats not an option)",1,3

The goal is to retrieve all related posts (maximize recall) while at the same time limit the number of non-related posts retrieved (maximize precision). I've developed an algorithm to score the posts on how closely related they are to the headline where we take the posts that surpass some cutoff score as the ones that are related. The actual algorithm isn't important.

What I'm wondering is how would you go about tuning the hyperparameters (including the cutoff number for example) of any algorithm without any training data. 

This is my situation:

- There does not exist any data that is already labeled or coded as a training set.
- Presumably we could go through and code some examples of headlines and the list of posts that are related, but that becomes very tedious very quickly and I doubt we would be able to go through very much given our resources.
- Crowdsourcing to code some data is out of the question at the moment.

How would you go about this situation? Is there a way you would train your algorithm to find the right hyperparameters? Or would you just deploy the algorithm as is with certain untested default levels and see how it performs and maybe design some type of embedded coding test in the background with your users (for example, how many posts do they view per headline as a proxy for relevance)? Any other suggestions?

I know that a lot of the statistical learning methods make assumptions for the distribution of the variables but what do I do when i see a highly skewed distribution?

- Is it better to try and normalize it with sqrt or ln?
- Should I bucketize it?
- Should I leave it as it is and use a model that doesn't make strong assumptions about the distribution of the data? e.g random forest?
- Do I use min-max scaler or stdScaler? How to know what to use and where?

**/tl;dr**

&amp;nbsp;

Background on me:  I'm an engineer who made a feeble jump to 'citizen data science' in 2017.  sum total of my education are the courses at fast.ai, by /u/jeremyhoward .  I'm a programmer, not a math PhD (which is why the fast.ai courses appealed to me).  I also have a background in developing IT curriculum, which is why I am posting this. 

And, I'm *quite sure* that the 'how do you get started in Data Science' question has too many answers out there, and none of them are great.   I'll hack a quote together, stolen from [Paul Lockhart](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) and reworded to be relevant to this problem (**bold** are my edits):

&gt; our present system of **data science** education is precisely this kind of nightmare. In
&gt; fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a **person's** natural
&gt; curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldnt possibly do as good a job as is currently being
&gt; done I simply wouldnt have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soulcrushing
&gt; ideas that constitute contemporary **data science** education.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here's are the problems I see with the current state:**

* Too many (very convincing) answers out there to the 'how to get started' question. (blog posts, moocs, reddit threads, etc).
* The answers are typically incomplete due to the *individual* biases of those answering.
* The answers, (and those recommending them after the fact) begin to become stale vs. state-of-the-art the *moment* they are posted.  (e.g. are we seriously still recommending the 2011 Ng course?)
* Most of the learning path recommendations are too frontloaded w formal math/stats heavy for the people typically asking it. Someone who is considering a bona fide Data Science education will *not* need to ask 'how do I get started in Data Science'.  They need help finding a degree program.  Most people asking this question *really* want to become citizen data scientists (bu they don't know it yet).

&amp;nbsp;

**Here is what I envision:**

* A canonical, open source, community driven project maintained in GitHub.
* The content is designed around a **very specific** framework that enforces some core concepts:
    * **problem based:**  Imagine a 'tech tree' of canonical ML/DL problems that represent the center of gravity of *high value* ML/DL methods and techniques.  Like [this](http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm), with one problem per domain, and maybe only 20-30 problems total in the tech tree at any given time.
    * **continuously updated:** Continuous improvements are submitted by the community, and curated by a small committee of qualified maintainers, who are curating around a well-define set of criteria.  New problems and accompanying lessons are submitted in a standard format (see below) via pull request 
    * **progressive**: crawl, walk run.  Learning paths always start with the 'hello world' ML examples, and have a few progressive learning paths defined that define 2-3 different journeys through that tech tree, where each subsequent problem builds on principles learned in those before it.  Problems increase in difficulty/complexity as the learner progresses through the chosen learning path.
    * **practical**: learners are writing code and solving problems as a first principle, with real data from the first step, and every subsequent step.  Humans learn by playing the whole game.  (Read David Perkins, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators))
    * **inclusive:**  This is not intended to be a replacement or comparable to a formal Data Science degree program.  The truth is, a formal DS education is *simply not* a prerequisite to using computers and code to answer questions about data, and to understanding how those answers are derived.
    * **emphasizes math:**  The goal isn't to 'cirucumvent' a formal math education, it's to sprinkle it in judiciously along the way, instead of making it a prerequisite.  e.g. hello world problems will branch off to teach the actual math behind linear regression.  When SGD s introduced, we will branch off to teach the actual math behind SGD.  Every problem should be accompanied by a new practical math component that is given nearly as much emphasis as the problem solving/coding.
    * **standardized:**  The learning content for a 'problem' has a well defined and consistent standard:  Problem statement, sample data, solution criteria, list of principles introduced, a math concept, etc.  The format of problem/lesson submissions is a Jupyter notebook with a step-by-step walkthrough of the problem and solution.  Bonus points for embedding a YT video walkthrough in the notebooks.


&amp;nbsp;


Thoughts?  Feedback?  Anybody want to help?  I'm qualified to organize and drive this initiative, but I'm not qualified to curate or define the specific problems in the tech tree.

I'm having problems figuring out how to compare data and understand which is the most competitive overall company. Please, understand I'm not native in english and my terminology might be pretty bad.

I am not sure how to model the issue at hand. My goal is to understand which of the airlines is most competitive price wise. I have 5 airlines, lets call them

* A
* B
* C
* D
* E

* A might fly to destination 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
* B might fly to destination 2, 4, 5
* C might fly to destination 1, 4, 7, 8
* D might fly to destination 1, 4 , 5, 9
* E might fly to destination 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

To compare prices, I'm looking on the price in a timeline of 10 months in future.
Tomorrow, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m, 9m, 10m.

What I want to get out of the data is the cheapest of the airlines: overall among all of the destinations. Is it possible?  [maybe i could switch to mileage and exclude airport tax from the price to eliminate destinations?]

If its not possible, maybe it should be done in sections, first get who's the cheapest overall if we fly tomorrow, then next month, then 2 months ahead and then somehow average results?

The idea is to spot the matches where the bookmakers undercut one of the players.
I realized an assessment of some simple betting strategies with some visualizations, and the assessment of a strategy based on the prediction of matches outcome using diverse features, including the odds.
The strategy was tested of the period 2013-2018 (11,000 matches).

No wonder it's so popular. Now, I wish to discuss about the capabilities of Pandas as an end-to-end solution for data analysis, and not necessarily data science which involves higher level topics such as Machine Learning.

I think even simple statistical analysis of a dataset can give you many important insights. Pandas appears to do everything in this regard, from data cleansing to even plotting a wide range of graphs to convey your story.

Furthermore, when machine learning gets involved, popular libraries like scikit-learn also have direct support for Pandas dataframes. Apart from this, my basic research using google tells me that the amount of data that can be analysed by Pandas is only limited by the memory you have. It can easily handle data in several GBs without significant loss in performance.

The reason for this question is that I'm currently preparing myself for a career switch from Software Development to data analyst and hopefully then to Data Science. There are hundreds of software tools and libraries out there but I think it's better to master one instead of dabbling a bit in everything.

As a personal project I have something in mind but I can't get started. Let me explain you the project and some possible variations.

*Project A: Imagine you work at the pricing department in an airline and you'd like to create a Pricing AI. *

**Available data:**

* Pricing of competitor A and competitor B for the next 3 months. Scrapped twice a day (hence a history of changes is available too after a while).

* Utilization of your airplanes (how full it is, and the speed of utilization growth is something that could be calculated too).

&gt; Here I made a scratch algorithm full of hard If-Else, but I'd like to know if there's a better ML/AI algorithm.


*Project B: You work at the same department, but instead of an AI you also see a possibility to apply ML to forecast competitor's price*

**Available data:**

* Since we have been scrapping our competitor's websites, for a given day (departure day) we have 90 pricing points.

&gt; Here I'm struggling because sometimes there's no linearity or (apparent) logic behind pricing changes.

How would you approach each project? Or could you think of a better Project C?

I'm struggling to get started (it would be my first project), and I want to start building a DS portfolio.

I am a relative newbie to data science who is doing a six month bootcamp. I'm still feeling pretty overwhelmed by everything and probably making mistakes in every direction, so feel free to point that out.

Right now I'm doing some EDA on data I've collected for 1 of 2 final projects I have to complete for the course. The dataset I'm working with is [FCC data on internet access by census tract](https://www.fcc.gov/general/form-477-census-tract-data-internet-access-services), and the goal of my project is to use census variables (population change, median income change, and so forth) to predict when broadband access rates will increase. Note that the FCC data is categorical [0-5] representing different categories for broadband subscription per 1000 people.

So far, I have wrangled my data into some 363k records, with each record representing one year for one census tract (72k census tracts in total x 5 years). So a (transposed) record would look like:

    state                 Florida
    tract_id          12009061001
    Year                     2013
    county                  12009
    CollegeCount                2
    Population               4513
    Income                  26346
    Median_Age               45.3
    PostGrad                  362
    NonCitizens                77
    TractArea               1.494
    PopDensity            3020.75
    PopChange             1.03414
    IncomeChange          1.02382
    AgeChange                2.22
    PostGradChange        1.59471
    NCChange                 0.55
    PDChange                  .04
    BB_Change                   1 &lt;&lt;&lt;

All variables ending in ""Change"" are percentage growth from the previous year, while the BB_Change target variable (&lt;&lt;&lt;) is the *next* year's growth. So logically I was thinking I could find and predict on factors like income where an increase in income leads to increased broadband subscription rates. However, upon spending hours and hours wrangling this data into shape I'm finding pretty much no meaningful correlation between any of my change factors and the target.

At this point I'm feeling like I am just flailing about and not sure how to continue and put out a meaningful product. I guess my questions would be:

* Are there any assumptions I've made so far that have doomed my project?
* Is there a way to continue onto Machine Learning even if my data is a mess? Could I try unlabeled permutation tests or something?
* Is it possible that working at the finest geographical level is introducing too much noise to the project? Should I work at the county level instead?

Any help greatly appreciated.

It looks like that it is a perfect problem for Machine Learning but we have a small problem: They do not have data from real users. 
They are expanding to the US and it is the only market where prediction of a transaction being good or bad is needed (in Europe all transactions are secured in this business model).
So, the solution they have adopted is creating a ""Scoring system"", where financial experts from the company rate a huge amount of transactions, they create a profile for the ""normal user"" and then they try to give weights for each variable. They then give a total score for each transaction and design the threshold for considering a transaction good/bad.

Since I am just an intern without a lot of experience, I want to read the opinions from the experts in this field about that strategy.
My point of view is that as long as we do not have data, that system is better than just not using anything at all and it can be good for first days in production.
Once we have data, I think that a a good ML model will perform better since it will not be biased from the variables and the more data we have the better it will perform.
With this scoring system they want to manually adjust the weights of each variable once we have the data in order to improve the metrics but my thoughts are: ""This is what a ML model does without bias, optimized and automatically"" so
I do not know if their system is good or not. 

Since I have freedom in this intern, I want to create some models with the data and compare them with the scorer system. I have created a way of comparison (comparing metrics as precision, recall, accuracy) from each system.

I just want to read the opinion from the experts. If this system they have designated has any sense (at least for the beginning),
if a ML model is better once we have data for this problem, etc. ",4,4

The offer is very vague, but it is biology based and located in the Midwest. I applied for a position in DC and was offered this one at a branch office instead. They wouldnt discuss pay until I verbally accept the position and gave me 48 hours. From Glassdoor, my best guess would be $13-14/hr. I would have to make the initial two day drive and a 30 minute commute each day.

However, Im also in the interviewing stage for two other positions: a non profit which works with my favorite type of data (crime reports, my dream job essentially) and a high paying ($5,000/month) consulting firm that are both in NYC and are strictly data science rather than being partially biology. Would it be overreaching if I emailed these two companies and informed them that I received an offer and ask where I stand in the hiring process? I really have no clue about what is proper. 

Ive put in close to 50 hours creating thorough applications for 50+ firms and expect to be offered interviews for at least two more. In terms of summer internships, some dont even close applications until the end of March. I feel like I could really be missing out on opportunities by accepting this one. I see myself as a person with a lot of follow through, so I would never want to accept a position and then back out; however, is that at all common in the job industry? 

I really have no one to bounce this off of and it was a very sudden offer so I was hoping to get some insight!",7,1

- Before I had a break due to studies and work, I went to the gym regularly, kept track of my progress, and was a real perfectionist...

- Same with tracking my food intake, everything was measured, weighted, own recipes, several diet plans, low-carb, carb-cycling, fasting etc.

- However: I lost track which approach was actually working, was the losing of fat and gaining of strength due to the effectiveness of a new training schedule, because of more muscle tissue, the weather, season, water retention, supplements?

- Also many food myths are howling through the internet and social media, take X for better Y etc.

- Since there are ways to find out causes for a certain outcome of multi-dependent variables, would that be a good approach to find out which methods are having a positive impact and which ones a negative?

Thanks for reading this. I am trying to build an ordinal logit regression to predict how likely an account is to migrate downward or churn. I need your help to determine if my methodology makes sense.

For my training dataset, here is my methodology:
- Dependent variable: Year over Year quantity change in category (from 1 to 9. 9 is the lowest)
- Independent variables: Last year purchase, customer support, and Email subscription data. They are continuous or discrete variables.

So I am using the last year financial, support, and subscription data to predict the likelihood of any downward migration. Does it make sense to do this?

I'm working on a program that polls people on who will win MMA fights, combines their predictions, and puts out implied odds as a result. The implied odds are then compared to the actual Vegas odds, to help find (in theory) bets that are ""worth the risk"", determining when you should risk your money on an underdog, when you should stick with the favorite, and when the oddsmakers did their job and you shouldn't bet. They are asked how many fights out of 10 each competitor would win as a measure of how close the fight is. Originally, I took the estimates literally, so the implied odds for different margins were:

* 5/10: even odds
* 6/10: -150
* 7/10: -233
* 8/10: -400
* 9/10: -900
* 10/10: minus some big number to represent a mismatch


However, I've started to wonder if that's a good approach. People naturally aren't very good with dealing with odds and probability. I've begun to think that the x out of 10 estimate should instead be interpreted less as an accurate assessment, and more as a general gauge of how the predictor feels about the fight. So, maybe the implied odds should be more along the lines of:

* 5/10: even odds
* 6/10: -200
* 7/10: -300
* 8/10: -400
* 9/10: -500
* 10/10: -600

I know I can implement multiple and then check for evaluation metrics, but deciding on which order and what algorithms to use can be tricky for me.

I'm guessing the features would be something like data set size, supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement, classification/regression, correlation between features etc.

Right now I'm trying to decide on an algorithm which classifies wavelengths into ~6 categories, where each wavelength can be in multiple categories. Around 300 data points with 4000 features. I also have quite a bit of background knowledge about the data which I would implement, so I'm leaning towards bayesian networks. Any ideas?",3,3

I've had a moderate amount of success (a couple of interviews), but no job offer yet.

Out of curiosity, I'll occasionally look up Data Scientists who are currently working at the companies I'm applying to. Some of them have PhDs in fields closely related to Data Science (such as Stats, Applied Math and Computer Science). That makes complete sense. But a surprisingly large number have PhDs in fields such as Biology, Neuroscience, and even Anthropology. I'm sure there is plenty data-intensive research going on in some of these fields, but I'm really skeptical how this experience is somehow better preparation for a Data Science career than, lets say, a Bachelor's double major in Computer Science and Statistics

I play with a group of volleyball players every weekend. Typically we'll get a few dozen players with various skill levels and position preferences to play together. Each player has a name, skill rating (integer, 0-120), and two position preferences (enumerated: outside hitter, ""OH"", setter, ""S"", middle hitter, ""M"", opposite hitter, ""OPP"").

I'd like to be able to create an automated process that creates ""ideal"" teams from a player pool where each element (player) has those four defined attributes.

For my MVP, I figure we can define a volleyball team as having the following:

* 6 players
* 2 OH (outside hitters)
* 2 M (middle hitters)
* 1 OPP (opposite hitter)
* 1 S (setter)

Further, the primary goal is to create *balanced* teams. For the sake of this model, I'm trying to minimize the spread of average skill ratings among however many teams are created.

[Here is a rudimentary model of my problem in Excel](https://i.imgur.com/yWnZsKZ.png). Circumstances are ideal: there are exactly 24 players, with exactly enough players of each position to fill four teams. Skills levels were randomly assigned. I used the Evolutionary solving method to find minimize Skill Spread, as I didn't satisfy linearity requirements with some of my formulas.

I'm just looking for general advice and direction. Should I use a programming language to model this? If so, which? Maybe an off-the-shelf program?

EDIT: To be clear, I have very little data science background. I'm getting more into the field and see this as a learning opportunity that coincidentally could be a huge boon to my volleyball league.",23,11

We have a set number of tests (~18) that can generally range from taking 8 seconds to complete to taking around 20 minutes, each on different types of data, different sizes of data, and different evaluations of said data.

A time series of a specific project's run time might look something [like this](https://imgur.com/a/O4eCR).

All over the place, right? Wrong; there's three situations where run time clusters: when the necessary data for the application needs to load the data to the machine prior to execution, when only a subset of the data needs to be loaded but there are already a lot of other artifacts being used by other projects actively loaded, and when everything is loaded and ready to use. This data was thrown together in a rush, but the data generated at work is a little more blatant; you can definitely see three trends lurking about in each project execution over time.

While this is neat information and I can eyeball it, I can't easily determine basic information on each trend; only on the whole. Getting the mean is cool and all, but it isn't an accurate representation of what I can expect the run time to be when I'm starting cold. What I'm ultimately trying to do is isolate each trend, plot a line of best fit through each, determine the slope of each, the average, and the standard deviation.

I've been spending a lot of time in and around data analysis, but it isn't something I'm well versed in. I spend some time here at home trying to learn and, while I'm making progress, I'm just not there yet. So far, I can bring in the data, plot it, and use NumPy to calculate all of the statistics. I want to say that the answer lies somewhere in or around Scikit. If I can just isolate the three sets, I'd really be in business.

Does anyone know a good place to start? I'm at that stage where I don't know what I don't know and therefore don't really have a clue as to what the right questions to ask are. Best I can say is that I've been playing with postgresql, pandas, numpy, and scikit.

TLDR; My time series has three trends scattered throughout whose behavior I can easily identify. How can I programmatically isolate each trend so that I can perform basic metrics on each separately?",10,1

* Peer review - not only code review but content review as well, just like academic research. If you want to use Excel I pity your fellow colleague that will have to review Excel formulas.

* Reproducibility - every output (spreadsheets, reports) to a client area should be reproducible for increased ease of auditing, peer review, error correction, etc.

* Version control - to organize collaboration, restore old versions, guarantee reproducibility of old results without having to resort to v1, v2 etc.

I'm a data analyst who stumbled upon a use case (using supervised machine learning to map A-&gt;B). In particular, we're trying to classify how ""hot"" a lead is - how likely will our sales reps close a sale.



**Background:**
I have large EDA datasets (~1000 cols, ~10 million rows ~ gigabytes in file sizes). The datasets are SAS filetype (.sas7bdat)
I'm having issues working with these, because they are so large.

**Problem:**
pandas.Read_SAS does not work for these datasets! Jupyter notebook instantly crashes when trying to read the files.

I tried to circumvent this by converting the SAS files to CSV, but
this is problematic too, because it returns a ""memory error""

Anyone have any thoughts on how to approach these types of big data issues?

I've decided to break the research down into four buckets.  The first bucket addresses the question:  **'what is your personal list of the 10 most important _fundamental_ , canonical data science problems that a beginner should address?'** 

&amp;nbsp;

Another way of asking this question, particularly for more experienced Data Scientists/Data Engineers is **'Your brain is about to be erased.  You can leave a note to your future self to learn/solve 10 fundamental data science problems, to expose yourself to as many fundamental DS concepts as possible.  Which 10 do you choose and why?'**

&amp;nbsp;

The goal is to expose the learner to as many different fundamental concepts and methods in **10 problems.**  Note that this research is specifically seeking **problems**, not concepts.  If you feel a concept is super important, such as SGD...then identify a problem that demonstrates SGD, and list SGD as the core concept taught by that problem.

Another way to look at it: I am trying to find the average respondent-generated onsets for a series of musical performance videos (~30s each), and am running into the issue of how to quickly find clusters of onsets.

I've run my audio through the aubio Python package, and have computed the timecode locations via the audio frame data, but am sorting by hand to create clusters (with a general IOI of 500-700ms for most). Compounding this, there are often an uneven number of onsets between respondents - rarely greater than 5, but it complicates things. I strongly suspect there is a faster/better/more accurate way to do this, but I can't find one that fits my very limited skill set. Sample collection of 'nearby' onsets: 

5.0006, 5.2513, 5.2485

Essentially, I am trying to generate a temporal location for each onset using an average of all respondent's data for that particular onset. It would be nice to have the ability to set thresholds for attaching values to other values, but I'm not terribly picky right now.

Basically, I don't view these as mutually exclusive, but I recently was rejected from a job interview because I was ""more focused on predictions instead of inference"" and was hoping to receive some feedback.

To provide more context: as part of the hiring process, I was tasked with finding if there was any relationship between dairy intake and eventual cancer diagnosis using published survey data (while controlling for common confounders such as age, gender, etc.).

The approach that I took, among others, was to create a logistic regression model with cancer as the binary response, and predictors such as dairy intake, age, gender, etc. First, I tuned the regularization parameter and class weighting (the cancer diagnosis was obviously unbalanced) with cross-validation and showed F1, recall, and precision metrics for the out-of-sample data. After optimizing the model based on the CV metrics, I looked at normalized coefficient weights to determine relative effect size of the various parameters. I performed additional analyses such as exploring minority class upsampling, collinearity of predictors, and looking at standard errors / p-values.

I felt pretty good about my approach, but received this comment from the hiring manager: 

""I looked through your project. I am very impressed with your thoroughness - for example, not a lot of candidates checked the collinearity and did the upsampling. But as I said on the phone, you are heavily towards the prediction side of data science, as opposed to the inference/statistics side. One example is that when you performed the logistic regression, the first thing you show is the precision metric etc, instead of the significance of different variables - the coefficients alone do not mean anything without the standard error. I know you have shown the significance table later but clearly you put that in a less important position even when the project is about finding whether there is a relationship between diary and cancer, not about predicting cancer. That said, there is nothing wrong with being focused on prediction - it is just not what this position needs. You will be perfectly fine with other positions that need prediction more than inference."" 

So I guess I'm a bit confused about the difference between creating models for prediction vs. inference. In my view, you want your model to fit the data as accurately as possible, and the best way validate a model is looking at out-of-sample error. Simply fitting an OLS model, printing an R^2 value, and looking at p-values can lead to an over-fit model and invalid inference conclusions. Once you have a valid model, I understand that standard error and p-values can be useful, but for multivariate regression with large n, you are getting a pooled standard error and many of your predictors will show significance. Thus in a lot of cases, it's more useful to focus more on effect size and perform analyses related to how each factor affects, e.g. adjusted R^2.

Any thoughts that can be offered as to whether I'm on the right track or should adjust my thinking would be much appreciated!

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has responded. It's been really useful getting feedback on the difference and feel like I have a better handle on which approaches are appropriate at which times.",38,81

I am currently doing my M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering majoring in Automated Science and Quantitive Methods. 
My program is 50% technical and 30% statistics and 20% management. There is quite a significant overlap in my statistics major and my technical major as most of it is optimization which is subsequently a lot of maths/statistics. 
So far my studies have been purely theoretical with not a lot if practical input which has been a thorn in my eye for quite a while. 


Now I am not a real engineer and by far not a professional programmer yet but I am striving for it every day. 

Enough to my back story and to my actual question.
I have applied to a minor research project by my university and got accepted to help and design a neural network for traffic sign detection. Apparently they believe that taking theoretical classes is the same as actual programming.
I am in bitter need of some guidance as in what might be a decent way to learn enough to create such a neural network to not let myself and my professor down.

As I have been lurking here for a while I have found a few recommendations in online courses and I am involved right now in:

* Jose Portilla - Machine Learning with Python (halfway through)
* Kirill Eremenko - Deep Learning A-Z

Books:

* Francois Challot - Deep Learning with Python

I also already went through die PY4E course from Washington University and Machine Learning by Andrew Ng.

I have until the 15th of July to finish this project and need advice on how to progress, if I am on the right track or if there are a few papers anyone can recommend me to  gain some more insights in neural networks and traffic sign detection.

For my time availability:

* This is my last semester before my thesis.
* I am working 16h/week.
* I do not take any other classes and will focus 100% of my time on learning as much as I can and progressing as far as I can.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

For an algorithm I am working on, I need to compute the gradient of a function. The classical way of deriving the partial derivatives is not possible as the function has summation operations in it:

In which G and H are some type of operation on x. How do I go about this? x is a Nx1 vector of variables, and T is a scalar.

**DataQuest**. It has a read then do interface. No videos, just text and examples. Then after each small subject it makes you program something using a  in-browser interface. I really liked this as it forced you to program as you go and worked a lot with real data. But it seemed like the site overall had a pretty limited scope of stuff to do. 

**DataCamp**. It has a watch to learn interface with tons of goood videos. Then a few questions. I've read it has some built in programming stuff now but I don't remember that when I used it. Just watching videos doesn't seem like the best way to learn, but DataCamp seems more popular and looks to have a lot more content, so I'm tempted to use it.

The underlying data looks something like this:



Widget ID | Date | Percentage Working | Feature 1 | ... | Feature n | Target
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
1 | 2018-01-01 | 1 | 100 | ... | 150 | 1
1 | 2018-01-02 | 0.5 |  200 | ... | 90 | 1
1 | 2018-01-03 | 0.3 | 50 | ... |  80 | 0
2 | 2018-01-01 | 0.9 | 75 | ... | 75 | 1
2 | 2018-01-02 | 0.1 | 125 | ... | 100 | 0
2 | 2018-01-03| 1 | 75 | ... | 95 | 1

For example, I know widget 1 was working all day on 2018-01-01, but worked for only 12 hours on 2018-01-02. On the other hand, widget 2 worked for 90% of the time on 2018-01-01 and only 10% of the time on 2018-01-02. Then I have a whole bunch of features about each widget. The last column (Target) is a binary column I created where a 1 means a widget was operating for 50% or more that day and a 0 means it's percentage working is less than 50% that day. 

I'm trying to examine the strength between a feature and the percentage of time the widget was working. The features could be of different type (numerical (as shown), categorical, ordinal, etc...) I've been naively treating it as a classification problem using logistic regression/decision trees/random forests to predict which class the widget belongs to. I don't actually care too much about how accurate the model is as I'm not trying to use it to predict. 

I've been examining the coefficients from the logistic regression, the actual decision tree, and the important variables from the random forest model to determine what factors were influential and to quantify their effects. 

The main issue I have with this approach is that I am treating each data point as independent from one another which, as a time series for each widget, they are not. I'm wondering if anyone has any approaches for getting around this issue or a better way to approach this problem? The only solution I've tried is instead of using my entire data set I'll randomly sample points without replacement. The entire data set has over 200,000 rows so I have plenty of samples even if I take 5,000 random points I assume this would reduce the dependency between points nearby in time.

I am to predict the number of interactions with a home page (similar to a Google search result) during the session. I have information like time / weekday of visit, session duration, which device is used and the `sequence_pages`that a user visited based on the search result. 

While the categorical and number values are not so much a hassle, I am contemplating on how to use `sequence_pages`. My idea is to use LSTM to do a regression solely based on `sequence_pages`, then another method like Feedforward net or Tree, whatnot to deal with other variable. Then I would do a model stacking by training simple linear regression, which takes output from 2 stacked model and train them based on the result.

One other question is: The number of different pages in `sequence_pages` is quite large (8 millions), while 1500 of these page appears up to 85% of the time. I am looking for a way to reduce it, maybe even before the embedding layer. What are my options, other than group other 8m - 1.5k pages to category 'Other'?

As part of our curriculum, we have to undertake a capstone project in the domain Marketing Analytics, (within that a topic we are leaning towards is Demand forecasting, or even analysing the impact of promotions on a product demand).

A best-case scenario is that we do a live project for a small company who can benefit from our effort and the final report. 

Not so best case scenario is we get our hands on an open source dataset which we can use for our analysis.

I'm hoping the reddit will come to the rescue and help me point to someone who needs their company data to be analysed or at least point to a usable dataset.

good people of reddit, please help !

I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a passion for music production and DJing. In the process of mixing music, I use a lot of isolated vocals and try to recreate my own.

Recently, I came across a website that uses machine learning to remove common instruments from a user uploaded audio file: https://phonicmind.com/

I paid and used this service and became intrigued by how effective it is. I want to apply my knowledge in ML and recreate this app as a personal project. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how this system works and how I may get started?

Any advice will be of help to get my foot in the door.

Thank you,

My clients vendors (people who my client buys good and services from) will sent in many invoices to my client per month.

My client has 1000's of vendors. He has data of the number of invoices his vendors have sent in per month for 2017.

On my rows in excel I have the vendor name. On the columns I have the months. The value field is populated by the number of invoices per month per customer.

My client's issue is that he could have a customer send in a stable amount of invoices in January and February (1,000 in each month), but then the number of invoices will drop in March to say 500 before going up to 1500 for April which means added work in April.

My client wants an Early Warning System of when to expect/predict a customer to send in more invoices per month than usual.

I was going to do a data compression related presentation but I have become suddenly really interested in Markov Chains and in a career as a data scientist/ML engineer.

How can I use my newly acquired knowledge about markov chains, logistic and linear regression, neural networks, and all these things I have learned to make a kick-ass masters project that also serves as an impressive talking point during job interviews?

I know I could do a lot and I have all the tools and skills but I need to lock down a project-I don't know what tho. I feel I have this information overload and am having a hard putting it all together to showcase my skills and hardwork that I put into outside of the classroom in my free time.

I work as a modeler and am trying to transition a process out of MS Excel. Currently I take an SQL table containing statistical data and export it into Excel. Within Excel I use the BETAINV function for a given alpha, beta, and probability. This formula is applied to 100K+ records. 


I would like to use R or Python to pull the data from a table in MSSQL and calculate the beta inverse for each record. I would then like to export the results to a table in MSSQL. 


Which language would be more appropriate for this task? I believe either language would have applications beyond this one within my role, but this is the project that I intend to use as a way to get started learning one of these languages.",4,2

Unfortunately, I'm beginning to suspect that my current role is a dead end of building automated excel reports with SQL. Now I won't lie, I'm fucking good at it, but it wasn't really what I had in mind when I took on the role. I'm now maintaining upwards of 20 reports for several clients, many due on the same day, and am trying to see what the next step forward is.

Looking back, I thought this role would be more like a consumer insights or market research role. I had testing methodologies in mind, inferential statistics, and am now essentially a data janitor. I'm also waking up to the idea that generally in marketing, the ceiling for analysts is pretty low. Sure the pay is good to get started, but it's account services that get the leadership roles.

So I guess my question to the wider audience is, once you became an analyst, what did you do you see yourselves doing 5, 10, 15 years down the line? What are some personal short-term goals you used to help keep long-term goals in the crosshairs? How would you define your career progression?",41,67

My company is attempting to roll out a ""Customer Assessment"" form that is intended for a Sales Manager to detail the fruitfulness of the accounts and business contacts that a newly promoted sales person will be acquiring.  

As it stands now, they elected for our HR department to run with, but upon further review realized this should be owned by our Analytics group. 

HR has been using individual word documents to capture this data from the field and then manually transfer over to a master excel file for reporting and analysis etc. 

I know there are ways to extract the data out of the word file, but across the company, expecting any type of uniformity is far fetched. 

That being said, does anyone have any recommendations for a custom form or survey application that can support a pretty niche set of KPIs? I'd love to be able to build the form / survey and then publish to our field and quickly compile results going forward. I tried to leverage google forms for this, but it couldn't support the level of complexity I am looking for.

I am looking for help in figuring out or learning how to figure out a data analytics problem. I just inherited an analytics project in my current company. I am not a data scientist (yet!), nor really a mathematician at this point - my background is firmly in computers. 

#####The Scenario
The scenario is we have a digital queue with a **producer** program that puts messages in the queue and a **consumer** program that takes messages out of the queue. Sometimes the queue gets backed up. 

#####The Data
I have the following variables information:
**Maximum amount of messages** the consumer can consume in 5 minutes: 7500 

The **average number of messages sent** by the producer every 5 minutes over the last two weeks: 6300
*Note: this statistic is deceiving. The average is actually usually around 300 messages every 5 minutes, but astronomical spikes in the amount of data being sent in the tens of thousands brings the average way up.*

The **average delay** of messages before they are consumed over a 5 minute period: 15 minutes.

The **max acceptable delay** over 5 minutes: 2 minutes. 

#####The Problem
Sorry if I'm not presenting the data the right way, I'm not even sure how to present this problem, just doing my best with what I have. Basically, I need to get **the average delay** = the **max acceptable delay** by **capping the spikes in messages sent** to a certain value. Mathematically, I have no idea how to figure out what that value should be. It's like trying to write a math problem. Any help appreciated.",5,1

I have a BA and a master's in geology (paleontology), and if I quit my program now I would get a second master's (in Health Science) as a consolation.

While I've been thinking about this in the abstract for a while, this has come to a head now because my fiancee left me. I've been taking some time to think about things, what I want out of life, and I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I don't want to stay in academia. This is a big decision and I know I need to think about it more before I have entirely decided, but recently I've been leaning heavily towards leaving my program and figuring out what else to do. Data Science is the first option that I would like to pursue, and while I am proficient in R and know the basics of Python (and have a good statistics foundation), I've made an account on kaggle to bone up on machine learning and whatever other useful skills I may not yet have.

My big question is, if I try to transition into data science now, will I be able to make it work, or will quitting the PhD be a big black mark on my resume? I'm kind of stressed out about the idea of continuing the PhD right now, but if I take some time and change my perspective and decide it's the best way forward to go into Data Science, I think I could probably push through the remaining 2-3 years. But if I could successfully transition now, I think that those 2-3 years would probably be better spent getting experience in industry.

Sorry for the rambling.

TLDR: Fiancee left me, doing some soul searching, don't think I want to deal with academia anymore. If I quit my PhD now will I be able to successfully transition, or do I need to suck it up and push through the next few years and finish the degree before I try to switch?",14,5

Use Excel to run calculations in the model
Extract data from a huge Excel database
Have helped on a SAP migration project through building Excel spreadsheets that help us migrate the invoices through allowing for automatic re-formatting. 

Aaaaand thats basically it. That is basically my role. There is no drawing insights through collecting, cleaning and reproducing useable data for analysis. There is no way I provide managers with suggestions/recommendations.

Now, Im most of the roles I have looked through they require someone who can; provide insights through data analysis, retrieve data from SQL databases, clean this, then analyse this to visualise the data and then communicate this in a way the managers can decisions based off of.

From what I understand; I will need to learn SQL  building and optimising queries(doing so at the moment), learn to use Tableau (am watching their tutorials and following along), learn to ETL or clean large datasets (this is on the to-do list) and be able to provide valuable insights.
THAT is what I have yet to understand. Provide valuable insights? How?? Do I literally tell the managers what to do (I.e. sell to men aged 20-26 from Cambridge)? What constitutes VALUABLE insights? What happens when they make a decision on your insights but the decision went south?? 
The whole insight thing is one that has be really confused.
Could anybody provide me with examples at work of them communicating and presenting insights? Did you go from raw data to Tableau Dashboards? Or are you involved in part of the process?

I have an interview with Facebook for a DS role on their analytics team.

They have a quantitative &amp; math portion of the interview and this is probably my weaker area.

It seems like they focus more on more basic stuff (although I wouldn't be surprised if they mixed in some tough questions. a friend of mine said that his questions were extremely tough and he has a BS/MS in math from a top 10 school).

I'm not asking anyone to reveal super specific stuff and cross any NDA lines.

-------&gt; What I am wondering is this...

In your experience (whether at Facebook or another tech company), when the interviewer asks a stats/math related question for a data science interview, how is the question framed?

For example - the binomial distribution. Will they be asking me to recall formulas? will they be asking me to just solve some word problem related to the binomial distribution? Or will they likely ask me to describe what the binomial distribution is? or will I have to solve a business related question using the binomial distribution?

Same goes for maybe probability questions.

Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks all.

I just recently got admitted into a MSBA (Business Analytics) program where the curriculum focuses on R.  I know that MSBA's aren't nearly as competitive as a pure statistics, math or CS major but for me this was the best option.

I want to focus on my future career goals and steps and wanted some input.

I don't want to be limited to just R that my program will be teaching (they focus on R, but I also realize that I'll need to do a lot of self-study in order to be a competitive candidate in the job market.)  I want to pick up either Python or SQL as well.  I'm currently work in the Supply Chain industry and I'm looking at a lot of Data Analyst / Consulting jobs post-graduation.  Would it be more beneficial for me to learn SQL or Python alongside R?

This is my first post in this subreddit, so please let me know if this should be directed elsewhere. 

I graduated this past June from UCSB as a Math major and Education minor. I'm proficient in Python/MATLAB and used Excel extensively. I haven't used SQL in any professional capacity, just know a few basic commands. I've interned as a Research Analyst at a cancer center, and have done educational research using coding tools and ""smart"" toys, worked as an admin asst. during my four years of college, and am currently a temp as a payroll assistant.  

I'd like to become a data analyst/scientist, specifically in the biotech/biomed research sector, but due to my relevant lack of experience, I haven't been able to get my foot in the door (no callbacks/interviews). I attempted SDSU's Applied Math M.S. program directly after college graduation, but didn't feel supported and felt extremely stressed/overwhelmed, and I think I just needed time to be out of school. 

However, I recently learned about UCSD's Data Science and Engineering Master's program, and found it intriguing and useful for my career goals. 

 I'd appreciate any advice and insight you guys might have about this program, and how can I improve myself in the meantime (before eventually returning to graduate school) so that I can add onto my skillset and be considered as a data scientist candidate in the future.

My company uses Excel 2016 as the front-end software, for reporting and modelling based on data consumed from the Cube.

I only worked for about 3 months, so I'm not familiar with the other companies. AFAIK, Python and R seem to be among the top-tier of the tools, and I plan to learn both as I already had some experience with R and taught myself C++.

However, one thing that I didn't get it is: **How do you create reports and share them with other departments?** Considering that probably only the data analysts use advanced analysis tools, at the end you still need to create Excel worksheets for the clients. I checked for some options, and so far I think it's clunky to get data into and back from Excel to R/Python. But I could be wrong, and I'm quite a newbie here, so I'm wondering if you guys can shed some light.

2 additional questions:

1) BTW if you guys know some excellent ways to **connect R/Python with Excel** please do point me in the way. I'm exploring an R package called readxl and it seems to be OK, but still clunky IMO.

2) I found it's slow to query Cube with a Pivot table (The MDX generated is not optimal even by my standard, and every refresh takes 10-15 seconds). Is there a way to **directly query with MDX and dump the result to Excel**? It's OK if it involves other software.

This is a binary outcome  1 means you bought the product, 0 means you didn't. There is no explicit data telling me whether an individual actually liked a product; I literally just have whether they bought it.

I have been able to develop a very nice recommender system using association rules. By ""very nice"" I mean it passes my visual sanity check - the items being recommended to each individual look to be right, based off their value for some attribute *A*.

I am having difficulty evaluating formally (i.e. quantitatively) the effectiveness of this system. I want to develop a baseline ""accuracy"" using the most popular items across all individuals as a recommender. However, the most popular items across all individuals are bought by 95% of people. My fear is that, in testing a metric like precision for the actual and baseline recommender systems, the baseline will kick the crap out of mine, since it's recommending the most popular items that just about everyone happens to have!

**What other evaluation metrics might I consider?**

I thought about trying to introduce some sort of rating mechanism by computing class-wise TF-IDF scores on the one-hot user-item matrix, the idea there being that a higher score for a particular item in that matrix means that item is really relevant to that class. But then it makes me think what the hell's the point of a recommender if you're just using TF-IDF?",9,3

I'm new to this team and the current state of affairs is a data warehouse system that doesn't keep administrative historical information (product hierarchy, attributes, etc) so a query about yesterday done today can be different from the same query done tomorrow - stuff are simply updated on look-up tables and we can't do correct analysis about the past. Some other ""raw"" information are saved in spreadsheets in a shared folder, but cell values on them are updated as well (lost information).

To guarantee reproducibility of my results I'm saving all query results (with the query I used to document it) in some spreadsheets inside the project repository, and this feels to me very redundant, potentially troublesome in some projects if the data is big enough and an overall ugly/awkward thing to do.

We've been recently given an SQL database with write access and I've been thinking now how to structure things well to save all historical information, avoid redundancy/huge loads of cached data inside repositories and guarantee reproducibility.

I came across the concept of Event Sourcing (storing everything as events in an append-only source datastore) and that seems very interesting for its properties, but the technical difficulties (mainly related to model changes) for implementing it correctly are making me think it would be better to find a compromise between this architectural pattern and some simple hacky stuff.

The internship is unpaid (I get class credit instead). 

The startup is a financial services firm that models and predicts the stock market. I said in the interview that I did some courses (Coursera) in ML, and did some projects in data manipulation and analysis, and it seemed like they liked me (probably because of the genuine interest in the field).

I'm not quite sure what they expect me to do/know. What they told me to learn (if I want to join a serious project): RL course by David Silver, DL Andrew Ng courses Coursera, some ML courses, Python and the pandas framework.
An example of a project (as they told me), is a RL model that forecasts the best option (sell/buy stock) using their current algorithm.
For example, I get as an input all the forecasts of the stocks (of previous years), and build a model that chooses what stock should the client buy today (building a portfolio based on previous data). Using Keras and some Tensorflow.

The internship is in a few months, so I'm still studying the material slowly (CS student after all). 

What do you think I'll do there?

My (uneducated) guess is most of what I'll do is clean the data (therefore pandas), and use 'simple' scripts to get the predictions, and then pass them the results. Like I'm automating some kind of an easy task for them (which is great, and really calms me down)",2,1

I'm much more familiar with classification tasks, so my first thought is to treat this like a multinomial logistic regression as the probabilistic scoring would be easy to interpret as an ""odds of winning a medal"".  But I'm not sure that's the right way to go.

So, does a multinomial LR seem like a reasonable way to go to you fine folks, or is there another approach you might suggest?

b. How do I correct the prediction from the trained model which occurred with data Y?

c. What is the range of each parameter/feature for which I can trust the model which was built?

767,2018-3-29,2018,3,29,14,87ypxy,Future employer asked for my desired salary range and I think I low-balled myself. How to negotiate?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/87ypxy/future_employer_asked_for_my_desired_salary_range/,UnwrappedSiegfried,1522300384,"I want to preface this by stating I'm fresh out of college and I am seeking employment for the first time (haven't had internships, aside from research internships/REUs). I interviewed for an entry-level Data Scientist position, which the employer stated that qualified applicants would have a bachelors or a masters in quantitative fields (I hold a bachelors).

Earlier today I received a call from my potential employer notifying me that my second round interviews went well and they would like to move forward and make me an offer. During the conversation I was asked for my expected salary range. This caught me off guard as I was expecting to be notified of an offer with a proposed salary through email. I stated something like $70k - $80k would be ideal (I had looked up what the salary range for this position was at this company beforehand but didn't remember off the top of my head). Based off my proposed range, I was told that it sounds like I did my research and that the range is appropriate. 

I know that typically data scientists in the US make good money. I also know that most data scientists hold a masters degree or PhD in quantitative fields. I've heard they make around $120k / year on average. Given that I'm fresh out of college with virtually no work experience and not too many hard skills, I am not expecting to make anywhere near this much. I thought 100k would definitely be pushing it or too much. Even 90k seemed questionable to me right out of college (and in a previous application for a different company and position altogether, I put 70k - 90k as my desired range and my friends told me 90k is too much). So I thought 70k - 80k was reasonable, after all I feel lucky to be even offered a data scientist position with just a bachelors.

Well after my conversation, I went onto glass door and checked what the numbers actually were. It said that the typical Data Scientist salary at this company ranges from $78,000 - $105,000. On paysa, it says the average salary is $94,000 with a listed range of $80k - $109. Granted, I know they also have a different Data Scientist position looking to hire only masters or PhDs. On Glassdoor and Paysa there is no distinction between these positions, so I'm sure this is skewing the numbers. At any rate it looks like the lower end of the pay range is $80k.

So: I was told I'd get a call tomorrow with details on the offer and next steps. I want to negotiate myself out of this. I'm worried that since I asked for 70k-80k, they'll think I'll be happy with 70k and offer me that. I'm hoping to change my desired salary range to $80k - $90k (just a $10k bump from what I had asked). Is this advisable? I was thinking to say something along the lines: ""The range I proposed yesterday was just an estimate. After doing more research on the position and obtaining a better understanding of its (my?) market value, I would be comfortable with $80k - $90k. I think this is justified because I meet essentially all of the qualifications you are looking for (and I do).""

TL;DR: potential/future employer spontaneously called me and notified they'd be making an offer. Asked for my desired salary range. Caught off guard, I replied 70-80k. Glassdoor and Paysa list the salary range for this position at this company is 80-105k. I want to negotiate a 10k bump on my initial request to 80-90k. How can I do this? Is this even advisable?

Ideally, we would want someone with some experience in finance. The job listing (shortened) is the following:

&gt; Our servers are constantly collecting enormous amounts of cryptocurrency pricing and fundamental data. With the data that we collect, we are able to analyze exciting datasets that allow us to:
&gt; 
&gt; - Develop advanced in-house trading algorithms
&gt; - Publish cutting-edge research and industry insights
&gt; - Implement both new and traditional financial metrics to cryptoassets
&gt; 
&gt; We are pairing some of the industrys most experienced traders with programming experts to present the world with unparalleled industry research. By implementing creative and unique research strategies, we will be able to dive and analyze patterns that others may have overlooked, providing our team with a strategic edge in predicting future market movements and creating unique, in-house valuation models for cryptoassets.

&gt; - Your main role is strategize and ""think outside the box"" to develop unique cryptoasset valuation models using live, historical, and projected future data
&gt; - You will be assisting our Data Science Intern in the projects that he is assigned
&gt; - You will be responsible for publishing ground-breaking insights and analytics that have never been done in the cryotoasset space.
&gt; - Your goal will be to become a leader not only in this company, but in the cryptoasset industry as a visionary for applying old and new metrics to cryptoassets
&gt; - You will lay out the groundwork for creating metrics and valuation models for cryptoassets for the inevitable time when the crypto market is no longer a speculative market.
&gt; - The aforementioned roles are very vague, because we need a candidate that will truly take initiative and decide how we can apply big data in a useful and insightful way to create valuable data for institutions and crypto-funds in this growing industry
&gt; 
&gt; **Does this excite you?**
&gt; 
&gt; I hope it does, because we are seeking experienced data scientists preferably with a strong background in finance that are ecstatic and enthusiastic about blockchain and cryptoassets as much as we are. The thought of publishing ground-breaking research and potentially being involved in the development of the future ""industry standard"" of a crypto-asset valuation model should be thrilling. If not, this job is not for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Salary:** will range from $85,000 to $140,000 DOE, and yearly bonuses are a possibility depending on the quality and impact of your work. We are currently a small funded start-up, so a possible promotion to an executive/director position with equity is not out of the question either.
&gt;
&gt; **Cover Letter**: 1) Explain what your current favorite project / cryptocurrency is and why; 2) What your favorite cryptoasset valuation model currently is and how you would improve it further (NVT, INET, VOLT, etc)?

Now for the questions:

1. Are the job responsibilities too vague?
2. What type of data scientists should we be looking for? Would hiring a PhD candidate make a huge difference? Or would candidates with less experience but more passion for the cryptoassets industry be a viable option?
3. Obviously, candidates would need to have experience with financial valuation models, but we also want them to be flexible in finding interesting bits of data, whether anomalies in valuations or correlations between price and other data that we're collecting (social media presence, number of followers, number of active developers and git commits), sentiment analysis, etc.). Is this too much to ask for? From my understanding, data scientists are often experienced in one or a couple of specialties (Statistician / Mathematician / Machine Learning Scientists / Actuarial Scientist). Please correct me if I'm wrong.
4. Are data scientists who we should be even looking for? If so, what type of experience should I be looking for in their resumes for the duties that are laid out in the job listing? 

Thanks in advance. Your inputs will be greatly appreciated. And feel free to PM me if you think you'd be a perfect fit for us and we can talk more (hope this isn't breaking any subreddit rules). 

P.S. There should be a hiring guide for companies (especially startups without a CDO yet) looking for Data Scientists ;)",56,38

The clusters work for our business use but I am curious how often you all would recommend re-clustering? And why would one re-cluster at that time frame? (Is this more of a ""art"" then a ""science"" or are there metrics in outstats etc.?) 

My hypothesis is that we would want to keep the same clustering centres and re-cluster customers using those stats for 6-12 months. 

Appreciate your input. 

Edit:
 1. point of clarity, the groups are already clustered. Im curious if you all would take customer 1234 who is in cluster D recluster them 3 months later and now they are closer to another cluster (ex. cluster C now).

2. Then create a history table to show customer 1234 during Q1 of 2017 was in cluster D then in Q2 of 2017 was in Cluster C",10,7

I have experience working *around* MMMs, but I've always been at a firm that outsources the actual model building to a consultant. I've never gotten close to the nitty gritty details of the model building process. I'm experienced in R, or well versed enough to google-fu my way through most issues. If I'm successful, this will be used as a forecasting tool, not an ROI measurement. Accuracy is necessary, but nobody will be getting fired because of it's outcome.

I've gone through the unpleasant process of collecting and aligning weekly sales data, with weekly media data (impressions) by media channel (TV, Print, digital...) for the past 24 months. I have also created a comprehensive list of sales promotions and major holidays that impact the business.

I'm looking for advice on what process to take when attempting to build this thing. Here is my current roadmap:

* **1** Determine seasonality, holiday impacts, and underlying trend of the data. Probably use the forecast package in R for this. But I've also thoughts about just using dummy variables to let my model take care of that. 

* **2** After I have deasonalized the data, I'll build the first draft of the model with media data. Will probably use a GAM approach, which I think will handle the minimum thresholds and diminishing returns that are common with advertising pressure. A pretty good article about that is [here](https://www.themarketingtechnologist.co/the-gam-approach-to-spend-your-money-more-efficiently/). I should note that I'm not married to the GAM approach.

* **3** Review model fit and significant variables. Do some variable clustering, and generally tweak the model.

* **4** Apply some type of adstock tranformation to better account for the lag impact of the media. I've found a few approaches online that look promising, with [this](https://justrthings.com/2017/12/30/a-multivariate-approach-to-adstock-rate-modeling-in-r/) seeming to have promise. 

* **5** Rerun model and play with adstock functions until i have something worthwhile. 

My question is, do i need all of these steps, or can i just dummy out the seasonal impacts and include the untransformed lagging media variables in my first pas of the model? How do I go through the process to both account for the S curve of media impact, and the adstock effect of the media?",6,6

I've been learning Python, really enjoy it, it's so powerful and it feels like the capacities are endless!  Although I've been struggling to incorporate it into my work. No one else uses it. 

I have used Python for a few complex tasks but have found that the output is very standalone, and not publishable to a wider audience like Tableau. Also running Python code each time is a manual process.

I want to be able to incorporate Python code into the ETL process. That way I can do complex data analysis/transformations and feed the output back into the database in an automated fashion. Does anyone have any experience with this? I'd be interested to know how Python is used in other people's workplaces. Cheers! ",26,11

I need some help:

I'm trying to forecast sales for some electronics products, and I have the following information:

1. Historical sales
2. Historical prices
3. Historical prices for other products in the category

I can provide the future prices of the product as well as future prices of the other products in the category too. 

Can you please suggest what the easiest way is for me to forecast for this? I only have excel as a tool. I know there are other tools such as R and the like but I am short on time. 

It will most likely require some kind of multiple regression but considering my lack of command on stats, I am struggling to implement this. 

You would see that I have mentioned prices of other products in the category, and that is because if a normally expensive product is slightly reduced in price, it will impact the sales of the current product as the value proposition is not the same for the customer, so it is important to look at all products prices as well. 

Your help on this matter is very much appreciated. 

If you reckon it would be impossible in Excel, what is the next best alternative that is easiest to implement?

Thank you for reading. ",5,5

my name is Markus and I want to develop a hierarchical topic modelling system for written documents.

The requirements are:

- no fixed hierarchy -&gt; model should built up hierarchy by itself

- dynamic changes to hierarchy with the introduction of new data (new topics, changes in topics)

- no topic pool -&gt; the model should learn similarities between documents and thus predict that a document is associated with a certain topic/cluster. In other words, the topics should be detected by the model itself, not by human intervention.

I am familiar with hLDA and HHMM and have looked for hierarchical topic models, but to my best knowledge haven't found one that satisfies all requirements.

My question is if there is a model, which could work and I haven't found yet, or if there is just no system out there.

I am grateful for all answers, questions and suggestions.",2,3

My manager asked me if I knew of any places we should post the job ad that our recruiting department might not be aware of, so now I'm asking you guys. Outside of the mainstream sites (indeed, glassdoor, etc.) are there any online job boards or search resources you regularly monitor for data science specifically? Do you ever search on Stack Overflow for instance?",10,5
822,2018-3-31,2018,3,31,23,88j5gy,Validate significance of classification of unbalanced datasets?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/88j5gy/validate_significance_of_classification_of/,stratos12345,1522508320,"I am working on a project to compare difference classifiers on a binary classification problem with a skewed data set (~75% negative, 25% positive samples).

The comparison framework I have set up is as follows:

1. Use a sampling method to balance the dataset.
2. Perform k-fold cross validation to obtain different metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).
3. Calculate confidence interval for accuracy using the formula found in using this formula: http://shakthydoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screenshot-Saturday-25-January-2014-074806-IST.png
4. Report the metrics and confidence interval for the cross validations as the expected performance for unseen data in the future (no separate held-out test set is used).

Some questions and concerns I have:

1. Since whatever metrics I report have been calculated based on the dataset obtained after balancing, do they still give accurate estimate of performance when applied on new real data, which will be skewed?
2. How should I calculate confidence interval in this particular case? Something feels off about the way I set up the experiment.
3. Student's t test has been suggested at https://www3.nd.edu/~rjohns15/cse40647.sp14/www/content/lectures/28%20-%20Classifier%20Comparisons.pdf to be used with cross-validations. Is it a good test in this case?
4. Is reporting cross validation result (with parameter optimization for models) sufficient? Or should I have a held-out test set for this purpose? In case of a test set, how should I measure confidence interval?

These questions are just certain concerns I have. The overall idea is that since the original data is not balanced, and the whole framework is based on balanced data, it makes me very skeptical whether the results I obtain are good projections of performance of these classifiers in the future.",4,17
