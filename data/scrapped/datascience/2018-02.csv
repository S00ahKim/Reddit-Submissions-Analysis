My background: Im majoring in Statistics &amp; Economics at a major university, with the Stats major being added only in the past year. I have one more year of undergrad left and am hoping to pursue an M.S. in Stats after graduation. My current dilemma: Im searching for summer internships with any title similar to data analyst/data science intern, but I havent had much luck so far. I have some experience with R, Python, and SQL (mostly from online courses) but not a very impressive resume for these kinds of positions at this point. I am involved in a few interesting projects and will have a better resume after graduation, but right now its pretty below-average. 

Would spending the summer improving programming skills, taking relevant MOOCs, and working on personal projects/competitions provide similar benefit to the average summer analyst internship? Im thinking I could do this and then go for internships during grad school, but Id love to hear some other opinions from people with careers in the field. ",17,24

Also if anyone's got a moment and would be down to offer advice, here's a small essay: I've been working as an analyst for eight months now out of college and am hoping to move on within a year to a more data science focused role.

I know and use SQL and SAS on a daily basis at work. I've also been slowly convincing my boss to let me use Python more and more in lieu of SAS. 

The main problem I see for myself is that my undergraduate degree in business doesn't hold up against applicants with a strong statistics or CS background. Also (and here's the big one), I was depressed and lazy in college and ended up with a &lt; 3.0 GPA. That hurts my options when pursuing a masters pretty badly. Any advice would be appreciated!",6,3

-Big Data Management: kinda what the title says, just taking charge of vast amounts of data

-Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics: trend spotting of the data provided by people who do Big Data Management

As I am just a teenager who has no connections to anyone in the technological industry, and clueless about worklife, I have not very clear ideas of what I am getting into. However I do have 5 years of sustained passion in technology as well as a recently newfound interest in how large amounts of information works. What drew me into these courses are the fact that I get to look at vast amounts of information and possibly look at insights and gain wisdom about the world around me from them.

My side interests are psychology, philosphy, literature, current affairs and visual arts if that helps, I doubt it does though.

I am a very analytical and logical person by nature, so I thought the world of technology would be right for me. I am also very unconventional and artistic in the avant garde way. I am slighly worried that this trait of mine would inhibit me from fitting into the industry because Im not the type to find motivation in repitive or unchallenging work. For example subjects like accounting is a challenge for me, not because of its difficulty but because of its repitive nature. I am afraid I would find suffer the same way if I pursue data science careers.",17,0

One contains names of cooking ingredient and some additional info, an the other is a list of ~1300 different products with titles, measurement unit (liter, piece, kg, ...) and price per that unit of measure.

Since in my first data set I have entries like `milk`, `peper`, `salmon` etc... I'd like to ""connect"" it with the second data set which contains products with names like `fresh milk from producer such and such 250ml`.

I was thinking about finding frequency of every word in the second dataset with products and than deciding on some treshold so that when I try to match `milk` with `fresh milk from producer such and such 250ml` I'd first filter out words with frequency above my treshold that don't belong to first data set. Which would turn `fresh milk from producer such and such` to `milk 250ml` since name of producer and words like ""fresh"" are present in many other product names.

After that I was thinking about matching word `milk` with every word in what is left over from the original product title and using some string distance measure to calculate some kind of ""match"" score.

I'm also not quite sure how to normalize such score since I will have to compare it to other products and they will most likely have different word count.

---

**In the end, I'm actually looking to get a list of products for each ingredient with its price and measurement unit. It might be good idea to filter out the extremes. For example for milk I might get 5 products and all but one have liter for measurement unit but one which have Kg, so I might remove that one. After that I might filter out product which differes greatly from average or median price.**

I started working as a data scientist in the telco sector a couple of months ago. I have a masters degree an phd in statistics and previously worked as a biostatistician in a university hospital.
My evaluation after a couple of months is that I really miss the statistical vigour that I was used to. I am aware that I cant expect that an industry job has the same methodological depth than a research function at a university. For example, I get critiqued by my manager for pointing out a severe methodological error in a variable selection procedure that is used. His point always is: when it works, than it is correct and you dont need to fix it (however there is no metric to evaluate if it works or not). 

Can anyone point out to me what realistic expectations are in industry? Is it just this job with this manager, or do i need to assimilate and let go of the rigour I am trained in?

I was analyzing a dataset of a quasi-social network style app, where users interact with their friends in a certain way.

What I found very exciting while rummaging through the data is to find all sorts of odd ways people used the app, that the app wasn't designed for and doesn't natively support. Some of these unintended use cases might warrant a dedicated feature added to the app, or even a spin-off app.

Here's my question though - how can I asses the 'demand' for a given unintended use case? I mean it could be very big, but since the app wasn't designed to support it, and it's not marketed as providing that sort of value, we shouldn't see many occurrences in the data we have now.

Any way to gauge demand (hopefully from the current dataset I have)?

I am an international masters student in statistics in the U.S. and I would like to get a job in the states after my grad study. I would like to ask a question about summer internship.

###Question:
 In view of increasing possibility of getting a full-time job (data science/analytics), how do you think of doing an intern at a laboratory in campus (especially a CS or other engineering lab dealing with machine learning application) rather than an internship at a company?

###Brief background:

- A first-year master student in applied statistics at one of the top public universities in the U.S.
- Bachelors in statistics from South Korea
- A data science internship experience at a government organization in Korea
- A research internship experience in a laboratory (data analytics) at university in Korea.
- No work experience in the U.S.

Below are the pros and cons of working in a lab I thought.

###Pros:

- Can accumulate my competency in computer science (e.g. machine learning / programming) intensively which is nowadays required for getting a data scientist/analyst job.

- Since finding a lab position on campus is easier, I can save times so that I can more concentrate on my study and do other things for improving my competitiveness. (I have seen a lot of students in here are wasting so much time for submitting 100-200 applications and get just 0~5 opportunities to interviews; so they neglect their school job. I know such efforts are inevitable when I look for a full-time job, but I think it isnt worth the cost we paid for the masters program.)

- Can extend the work after summer. I can even work part-time before and after vacation so that I can participate in more long-term projects.

###Cons:

- Can't have an experience of working in the industry. Currently, a data scientist gave me an advice that it is important to have experience in a business setting since my goal is to get a job at a company.

Im however uncertain what steps I would need to take to get data science positions and what would be my limitations given my background. In my graduate studies I specialized in neural engineering which introduced me to signal processing applications and neural coding using information theory but the courses focused on Matlab coding instead of Python or statistical software. We had a bioinformatics specialization that I regret not pursuing but did gain experience from the degree in programming and statistics so Im currently in the process of learning new skills such as R programming and more advanced statistics.  My degree in Physics introduced me to the standard foundations of describing the core physical theories in a partial differential equations formalism where I was able to take elective courses in computational modeling and computational physics but these courses also only used Matlab and not statistical software.  

I entered industry a year ago in a quality control data analyst position where I review scientific data for errors and am at the moment looking to relocate to a city such as Philadelphia to get a more advanced data analyst or data management position. I was first introduced to data science when I was applying for positions for my starting job where I got a phone interview with one of the hospitals in Philadelphia but found out that data science positions normally start out by requiring 3-5 years experience with specific knowledge/experience in statistical programming languages. One possible option Im considering is obtaining a data management/analyst job and once I have settled into the position start obtaining certificates in data science, R programming, python, and additional statistical software. Another option may be through referrals where I have friends in a bank that do data analytics where I could potentially gain experience in the statistical software languages used in data science directly. I would be looking to develop skills in SPSS, R, Python, SAS, Stata, Julia and other languages that are being introduced. 

One major concern I would have about data science positions going forward with this plan would be the competition where I would be competing with people with degrees in data science, mathematics, statistics, and computer science where some people may have PhDs. What limitations does this put on me with a potential career in data science? At the moment I cant pursue further education because I need to pay off absurd student loans but if I tackle that problem I may consider doing further education depending on my experience in industry. I may be interested in getting involved in research involving neuroinformatics and understanding the neural code but I may set my goals for tackling problems that are more relevant to industry. The ideal pathway I have currently set looks like this:

Quality Control Analyst --&gt; Data Analyst/Management --&gt; Data Scientist/Statistician --&gt; PhD related to Statistics and Data Science --&gt;  Advanced positions in Data Science

Im interested in any criticism so I can make realistic goals for myself. I may just be dreaming here so please tell me if my reasoning is flawed or if there is only a low probability event of me achieving these goals. The PhD is more hypothetical since I wont know my responsibilities at that point in time but doing doctorate studies would be a goal if Im able to pay off my student loans.  

TL;DR: I'm interested in data science as a career option but am uncertain about my prospects since I have college degrees that gave me limited exposure to statistical programming but can easily learn new programming languages.

I'd like to make sure I have a good answer for this. 

My background is in empirical economics (MA and some PhD work) so all the data I have worked with are---in one form or another---noisy. For example, I'm working with a very large survey data of manufacturing firms in China, but the companies have discretion on whether they will fill out the survey in any given year. Thus, there is selection bias, which imply that any statistic calculated does not fully reflect the true state of things. I have used the econometric tools to account and correct for this.

I also worked with satellite images of the Amazon rainforest to estimate deforestation over time (defined as forest classification at time t and not forest at t + 1). Cloud passing over a given area in a given snapshot introduces some uncertainty into true level of deforestation. To reveal the extent of this, for a given area of land and for a given period in time, I calculated the maximum and minimum possible deforestation to put bounds on the observed deforestation reported by the Brazilian government.

These are just rough outlines of the examples and I will be adding more details in the actual interview. Do these examples reveal experience + understanding of noisy data? How would you answer this question?

Ive never held the specific title of data scientist, but the work Ive been doing over the last two years seems to align strongly with the role. Before that, I had a lot of experience as (what Id call) a systems/business/data analyst. 

Id really appreciate any suggestions and constructive criticism. 
Unclear formatting? Too much/little detail? Should I add a skills section? Is graduate coursework a good idea to include? Is there a better way to include/highlight my projects section (from my current role)?

In an effort to keep it shorter, I combine the two positions I had at my current place of employment together, but mainly listed the roles/responsibilities from my current position. Also, there is a year-long gap in my employment between the to companies. This isnt a typo, I decided to travel around the world for a year.

I graduated from a boot camp two years ago and I've applied to hundreds of entry-level data scientist and data analyst jobs with no luck. I currently work three different contract jobs. In one of my jobs, I work as an online mentor, which means I'm qualified to teach the stuff but not qualified to work in this field. 

I made 28k last year and because I only do 1099 work, I'm facing a huge tax bill in a couple months. Yeah I know I should've been paying estimated taxes along the way, but that's hard to do when you have $400/month boot camp loan payment.

I've done the networking thing to death. I've hit up my friend's sister's boyfriends and my friend's tinder date for coffee and nothing has come from that.

I'm constantly working on improving my skills and publishing work, but nothing is coming from that. I've had professional data scientists tell me they're stumped as to why I can't get work.

So I guess this means that I need to go grad school and go further into debt. Let's say I choose to do a masters, how do I know the job market won't be stacked in favor of PhDs? 

I honestly don't know what to do at this point, my motivation to do my current jobs is eroding and it's affecting my performance at work.

At this point, all I want is an internship, but that is pretty much impossible because all those positions require you to be in school.

Maybe I'm just bitter and I need to rant, but if there are pieces of wisdom you can spare, I would greatly appreciate them.",98,70

I double majored in econ and math (focusing on stats) from an elite liberal arts college in 2015 and have been working at a top tier economic consulting firm since. I've been interested in transitioning to data science, but I'm not sure where to start. Through both school and my current job I've become pretty skilled with R, SQL, and have a theoretical grasp of machine learning algorithms. However, most of my analyses at work is backwards looking, and because concepts need to be explained to lay people, don't really involve complex math. Thus, I feel like I need to get an advanced degree in stats to strengthen the resume. I'd prefer to get a masters as I wouldn't need to study for 6 years. Additionally, I have zero research experience besides writing my undergrad thesis, so my PhD app wouldn't be that strong (My classmates who went the PhD route all did research with a professor at some point during undergrad). However, in terms of data science, is a masters considered that impressive? 

Basically, I feel like a have a background that's suited to data science, but I'm not sure how to break in. Adding to my confusion is the traditional path that people at my firm end up on - business school. Does anyone have any advice for a lost soul like me?

It seems to me there has recently been a massive increase in the number of job postings titled ""Data scientist - Analytics"" or ""Data Scientist - Product"". 

Most companies now tend to have 2 so called DS teams - 1 in core data science and 1 in analytics/product. It's what I could see for Facebook, Spotify and AirBnB for example. In my understanding, the former does more hardcore/pure algo development whereas the second does more advanced reporting/product insight. 

Anyway, there is a trending ""title inflation"" that might jeopardize one's career if what you like to do is product design/insight by mining through massive user datasets  : if you do that in your current company but are still called a ""Product Analyst"" or ""Product Data Analyst"", it might get harder to move to a similar position at another company that calls it ""Data Scientist"". 

In this context, do you think it is that important to try and get ""Data Scientist"" in one's job title instead of say ""Product Analyst"", even though one does exactly the same job?",12,10

With that information I have compiled some results that tell me the all of the combinations of edit codes and the amount of unique record numbers that have that exact combination. It looks something like this:

I haven't really enjoyed my ~1.5 years in accounting since graduation, and I'm considering applying to URochester for their MSDS program. It's STEM-certified and seems very technically rigorous, not like a ""Business Analytics"" program, and their only pre-requisites are calculus and some programming knowledge, both of which I have. They also offer a summer bridging course if they think you need to brush up on math or stats, which I like the sound of.

Has anyone been in this program or heard from anyone who has been? I don't want to drop ~50K for a program that isn't worth it, but I'm definitely interested in the program.

I apologize in advance if this is not the place for a question like this but I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment and I have a bunch of questions. I'll try to be as terse as possible.

I have a B.S. in Psychology, a B.A. in English Literature and an M.S. in ""Game Science and Design"" -- which translates to user experience/usability/HCI research in the games field. I started a PhD at a big name HCI lab initially slated to work with him on education tech, but I just honestly found myself really being pulled towards health informatics, health and HCI, etc by taking a class on it and this lab wasn't really doing the health work I realized I wanted to do in the future. Between that and how personally unhappy I was at this particular location for a variety of reasons, I decided to leave. 

So now I'm applying to both jobs and other PhD programs and trying to get more data driven to round out my research profile. I have an ok stats and math background (Calc 1/2, 2 discrete math, a few levels of stats) but I find myself completely overwhelmed by really open ended questions. I just lack the perspective/experience in addition to probably just not being aware of some really obvious things. For example, I applied to a job which was a UX research at a health tech start, perfect right? Well they get back to me saying that the UX spot is closed but that I might be a good fit for their data analyst job. They want me to respond to a few questions in a response e-mail before we set up a phone interview.

Here's the prompt:

""To prepare for our conversation, I'd like you to think about an example data analysis problem: 

We are interested in quantifying the burden of mental illness and we are recruiting the smartest people to join us. For example, we are trying to quantify the number of working years lost to depression in employees of Massachusetts. 
1) How you would spend your first few hours working towards understanding or answering this question? 
2) What information do you need and how would you calculate the years lost?  
3) How would you verify that your calculation reflects the truth?""

Just to be clear, I am not looking for someone to come in here and answer these for me. I am honestly looking for perspective on how/why you would start doing certain things, what skills I can learn to aid me in these kinds of tasks, free courses online I can take, etc. 

My intuition at the moment is that the first step is to try to understand the different features of depression. You could find this in the DSM but there is also a public dataset I found which has data on depression broken down by symptom which might be useful. But here's where I get lost:

&gt;What information do you need

Need? Like is there a singular correct way to compute this and I'm just such a novice I can't see it? My first terrible guess is to try to understand the frequency of depression in the target population and then assume that frequency in a population of people who have taken time off (maybe I can find this in a labor statistics dataset?). Still though, I'm not sure how to formalize this into a ""computation"" if that makes sense.

&gt;How would you verify that your calculation reflects the truth?

From what I know about philosophy of science, this seems like an impossible task. But again, my experience says I need to actually run a study on people taking time off of work, even if it's a much smaller population and see if the results are similar.

I appreciate the hell out of anyone who's made it this far, I know there's a lot of text. Any/all guidance is appreciated. Cheers.

I'm a Harvard-trained PhD scientist working in biotech. I manage a team of scientists and deal with large data sets (~30 GB set of genetic information) and write my own python scripts to analyze them (although the scripts are fairly basic). 

Currently, I live in Boston and need to escape this city. I'm sure it's great for some people but I cannot stand living here any longer. I'd much prefer to live in, say, Montreal. Problem is, in the places where I want to live, there is almost no biotech. For that industry, options are basically Boston or SF.  I want to live in neither. Solution: migrate to an industry that is thriving in Montreal and other cities where I want to live. That means data science. 

My question is: Does my management experience, science chops (PhD and postdoc from fancy schools in genetics), limited coding skills, and comfort with large data sets qualify me for anything decent in data science? Or, do I need to retrain? 

Additional question: Is data science employment in a bubble or will there be lasting demand? The reason I ask is that bioinformatics (data science for genetics, basically) is in a huge bubble. The reason is that many bioinformaticians are being paid to do very basic work that is quickly being replaced with off the shelf software.

The project I got assigned to is basically developing a churn model, so first we've got to come up with  and calculate some features(which is what I'm working on; SELECTing features from various datasets and suggesting new ones). I have some questions:

Is it normal that the only code I've written so far is various dialects of non-procedural SQL? I came with an expectation that my main work will be using Python/Scala to build data pipelines and have already expressed this desire. The take-home test was exactly that - parse this JSON file, schedule the load into database, query it. 

It was fun but at my current project the moment the fun part - gathering and parsing - has already been done by another team(data governance) and it seems my sole responsibility for the foreseeable future is to query it.

I sure hope that this is going to change; the job requirements listed Python experience and the take-hoem test as well as interview tasks all reflected that. I seriously don't want to have my coding skills to atrophy so I'm concerned

I've found a few options, notably some free courses on EdX, Coursera, Udemy and Udacity, and the specialist sites Dataquest and DataCamp. Aside from some bits on statistics, I haven't found any other mention of any maths being taught as part of these courses, nor any mention of pre-requisites for maths knowledge. Is it that maths isn't actually a big part of data science? Or is it that a grounding in maths for data science is meant to be acquired elsewhere, and if so, what is considered sufficient?

The last time I did any maths work with any regularity was almost twenty years ago. Right now, I probably wouldn't be comfortable with anything more than functional maths skills and introductory algebra, so although I'd like to brush up on maths, I don't want to get invested in learning data science, only to find a few weeks or months in, I'm hit with something that's significantly beyond my abilities.

Whilst I'm here... as I'm totally unsure of which course to start with, could anybody offer their recommendation? As I said, my maths knowledge is mostly functional; I don't have any programming knowledge, but I'm comfortable with an editor and command line. I think I'm set on Python because of its wide application. I like the idea of being able to 'do' stuff with data online (charts, maps - fun stuff that would impress a 34-year old child).

I have taken a load of statistics and computer science courses, especially related to Data Analysis (Mining, Time Series, Regression, Stat courses generally). I've also always wanted to study astronomy, but sadly that's not a major that's offered in my country (Physics is, but I don't enjoy all of physics. ). 


I'm wondering if there's any academic discipline that combines the two? (Data Science + Astronomy) and if it's a thing : Do you know how should I go about searching for schools that have such programs or professors who do this type of research? I'm not all that familiar with the best search tactics. I've looked at a few Data Science graduate programs, and found one in which one of the professors/lecturers works in the physics/astronomy department and does research related to both fields; but this was by chance. Should I really go through every single graduate program to see if by chance I can find something similar? 


 I applied to that school solely because of that one professor, but I don't think my resume is competitive enough...

Keep in mind that the space industry in my country is basically non-existance so I can't exactly get internships or work experience...

I have a good stats and compsci background, but my past work experience has been in tech. 
In these last few months, I've began to really realize how different working data science in industry was compared to tech. 

I go to school in Michigan, so automotive is all around me. I've interviewed at a few auto companies - from suppliers that had just started to find out about the serious need to invest in data, to bigger companies like Ford that already have established analytics programs. I'd always be asked where I saw automotive going in the next few years and why I was interested in working for them. Each time, I'd explain how it became clear that automotive and other manufacturing, had only recently began to understand the importance of quality data, how industry has not capitalized nearly as much on this like Silicon Valley or Wall Street, and how they are now feeling the effects even though they actually do generate vast amounts of data that they don't know what to do with (one ford interviewer with a phd even commented that ford was projected to have more data than google in 2020?...).

Each time I said that, we would discuss and usually be on the same page. But this brought up a major challenge large non-tech companies are running into - shifting business strategies to dddm and having to create new analytics or BI divisions with imperfect data, simply to be competitive and innovate ways to capture profit. Even now, I always hear things like ""the company with the best data wins,"" at my office.

Working for one of these companies I've realized I often can't use the same approach I was used to analyzing an automotive market driven largely by quantity and sales. While I've made good headway, problems have definitely come up - some subdata is too small for decision forests, many variables are factors and not descriptive data (partIDs aren't really ints but are factors/binaries), parts of data are in long form and multi dimensional, etc.

I wanted to get opinions on how the future of the engineering industry may be shaped by data science (autonomous driving?) and possibly find out if anyone has experience with a mechanical engineering twist to data analytics?",4,10

Since I was studying, I never really decided for myself, if I wanted to focus more on the analytical part (let's name it ""true Data Science"") or the Engineering part (Performant Machine Learning / Data Architecture). My CS degree was kinda generic, so I choosed courses like distributed systems and data warehouse architecture, but also courses that involved heavy assignments in R for business use cases. I actually liked both fields for the coding aspect, so I settled for the first promising job that I could find within this range, so I ended up becoming a Data Scientist.

However, all my colleagues have a phD in physics or similar studies, so they have a different perspective of seeing the job. The thing is that I don't really like the way they do their work (Not saying that it's wrong or worse though). My company requires rather pragmatic solutions when it comes to develop new ""scores"" or ""insights"" for customer data, so the mathematical aspect of implementing certain statistical or ML algorithms is rather simple. We do mainly Network Analyses, that includes applying graph traversing algorithms, but also generic DS problems like fraud detection. So most of our work is discussing metrics or possibilities for getting insights out of certain data. 

The thing is, I'm somewhat an introvert and I love getting shit done, rather than having endless discussions about the calculations of our metrics (which changes weekly and makes us often run in circles because of changing management decisions). I'd rather sit in front of my screen and code software to provide solutions. I still think like a programmer while doing my job, so I love solving problems on my own to ""convince"" business users by showing them prototyps to simplify their work. 

Do you think that Data Science isn't maybe the job that suits me the most? I'd love to have a job where I could work more independently, like doing remote work and focusing more on delivering results, instead of engaging in company politics (like coworker X tries to seem smarter in a meeting than coworker Y so they criticise each other not because of the idea itself, but because it's the idea from person Y. Also don't get me started with all the brown nosing for getting liked by supervisor Z to climb up the ladder)

Is being a data/ML engineer different than that? One could think that Techy's care about other things than analysts/scientists. If so, I'd rather focus my future on learning things like Spark, Scala or Java Script because I won't ever be an expert in every field, ranging from Data Visualisation with D3.JS, maintaining libraries in R, to implementing a lambda architecture with Hadoop or what not. I'd love to have some orientation for my future, because I'd like to become an ""expert"" in some specific field, instead of keep going like a generalist. Experts usually get freedom to work, generalists need to communicate a lot and I'd prefer rather the first.

So which field within this broad Scope of DS/ML/DA usually offers the biggest freedom for working like an ""introverted code monkey""? I'm able to have social interactions, I just don't enjoy them that much.",9,24

My school is offering a new Data Science major this coming fall. It is a regular statistics degree with a bit of computer science spliced into it. The course can be found here: 

http://catalog.csueastbay.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&amp;poid=6964&amp;returnto=4110

In your professional opinion, will having this degree along with personal projects be enough to get a decent job without a Master's? While I would like to be a data scientist, I have doubts that the data science degree option would be enough by itself to get a job in the field. I fear that if I switch majors, I might be limiting my future job options by getting an overly-specific degree. The general question I ask is, will getting this data science degree be better or worse than a computer science degree for finding a good job upon graduation. Any thoughts are appreciated on the subject, thank you for your time.",3,0

Are there any opinions on the new program?

I'll also add for clarification that I planned my schedule for the next four years so that I'll be able to double in both data science and statistics (the stats courses sound so cool here (,: ). I'm pretty involved in the program and currently working with the division's education team. I'm developing modules for classes which allow students to work with a data set relevant to their course as well as lab assisting for a DS course. I'm very much enjoying the things I am doing with them! Going to grad school is a goal of mine and I would like to go into research in the future (or industry if I change my mindset about it, haha). I was planning majoring in math and/or CS but I took data 8 (foundations of data science) last semester and with the new data science major coming out, math classes would be kind of difficult to overlap. 

I know I read many times on this subreddit that there isn't one way to become a data scientist or at least break into the field, but would majoring in data science at Berkeley be ideal, or should I instead major in stats? Both majors are really awesome so ideally I'd want to do both but I'm still not sure.

things i have tried,

linear regression by each customer for lot. So here i segment data by customer, use customers earlier results to predict results on current batch, MoE is averaged over all customers who use given batch, if MOE is large and negavtive(meaning regressor says results should be better than they are) then the lot is flagged.

the other thing i tried was bayesian regressor with NUTS sampler, basically approximating the distribution of each lot(because we dont get quality metrics on every item) and predicting quality off of that

I have a bunch of information about these volcanoes, including the rates at which similar volcanoes have erupted.

Now, the baseline risk assessment is calculated using two components: a likelihood factor and an impact factor. The likelihood factor says how likely a given volcano is to erupt. The impact factor quantifies how widespread the eruption could potentially be. Both factors were computed using ""business rules"" --- no machine learning or advanced statistics were involved.

My client wants me to better identify risk, incorporating other factors, too. So after turning over seemingly every stone and developing an analytic dataset whose features ""wow"" the client, I went about building a machine learning model. This model, by many measures, outperforms the traditional risk assessment in terms of its ability to identify the riskiest volcanoes. The model outputs a probability, I add that probability to the impact ""axis,"" and we get a new, continuous risk score.

Rank-ordering the top 100 volcanoes by both the new and old risk assessment, it turns out that 50% of the top 100 riskiest volcanoes, according to the new model, actually erupt. Only 10% erupt for the top 100 riskiest old-model volcanoes.

Where things get interesting, though, is in the middle, i.e. as the number of volcanoes to ""review"" increases. My client wants to basically ""bump up"" in terms of risk the currently-identified-as-lower-risk volcanoes. While the new model is often correct when saying ""this volcano is really risky -- I mean it,"" it still deems quite a few volcanoes as ""low risk."" These volcanoes erupt and shit really hits the fan -- this is really the opposite of what the client wants.

So, basically, the new risk model is really great through about the top 100 volcanoes, but then the old model catches up about halfway through the 300 volcanoes in our population, and actually outpaces the new model pretty significantly towards the end...

Anyone have any thoughts/ideas about what could be the issue, here? I've run statistical tests six ways from Sunday on both the new and old (deconstructed and fed into an ML model) assessments. Everything seems to favor the new one, while in practice the old one seems to perform better over the long haul.

Another question I have is: how would you best ""bucketize"" the volcanoes, combining the likelihood and impact axes (two separate vectors)? One thought I had was to look at the historical proportions associated with each bucket (say, High and Low risk), and just maintain that proportion for the new risk assessment.

Note: in testing the two models side-by-side, I performed a typical train-test split and only calculated results/outcomes based off the test dataset.",9,10

Yet data scientists are regularly touted as the unicorns of big data analysis.

While many of the responsibilities, techniques &amp; goals of analysts &amp; data scientists closely match, major differences exist between the required skillsets &amp; expected outputs for each job. 

For your business to thrive you need to know what's working, what's not &amp; how to improve. That much is obvious but figuring out how to go about it? That's tricky part.

Earlier, Business intelligence was something only for corporate could enjoy because employing analytics software was expensive &amp; it required building data centres &amp; hiring IT specialists &amp; they are also expensive. 

However, time have changed because data is getting bigger every day. In terms of volume &amp; variety, and businesses need data science if they are to capitalise on market opportunities faster than their competitors. Business intelligence &amp; Data science are distinctively different beasts.

Data Science Versus Business Intelligence

Using data science allows organisations to stop being retrospective and reactive in their analysis of data, and start being predictive, proactive and empirical. Moving from traditional business intelligence (BI) to adopting data science is a huge shift and a fundamental part of becoming a data-driven organisation. By taking an empirical view of its data and implementing tools like Hadoop and NoSQL databases, a public sector organisation can transform its operations entirely. Whether that means taking the pressure off the data warehouse, and so reducing cost; or driving efficiency improvements through recommendations for process changes, the opportunity is enormous.

To survive and prosper in the increasingly competitive market as well as to be able to resolve complex business problems, drive innovation and growth, companies must shift their focus from traditional BI to data science. Data Science changes the game for virtually all industries. When used in conjunction with predictive analytics, it allows organisations to achieve real-time insights and make future predictions that increase understanding of customer behaviour, improve response to customers and deliver a tangible competitive advantage. To give you some context, here are 10 key differences between the two:

Perspective
BI systems are designed to look backwards based on real data from real events. Data Science looks forward, interpreting the information to predict what might happen in the future.

Focus
BI delivers detailed reports, KPIs and trends but it doesnt tell you what this data may look like in the future in the form of patterns and experimentation.

Process
Traditional BI systems tend to be static and comparative. They do not offer room for exploration and experimentation in terms of how the data is collected and managed.

Data sources
Because of its static nature, BI data sources tend to be pre-planned and added slowly. Data science offers a much more flexible approach as it means data sources can be added on the go as needed.

Transform
How the data delivers a difference to the business is key also. BI helps you answer the questions you know, whereas Data Science helps you to discover new questions because of the way it encourages companies to apply insights to new data.

Storage
Like any business asset, data needs to be flexible. BI systems tend to be warehoused and siloed, which means it is difficult to deploy across the business. Data Science can be distributed real time.

Data quality
Any data analysis is only as good as the quality of the data captured. BI provides a single version of truth while data science offers precision, confidence level and much wider probabilities with its findings.

IT owned vs business owned
In the past, BI systems were often owned and operated by the IT department, sending along intelligence to analysts who interpreted it. With Data Science, the analysts are in charge. The new Big Data solutions are designed to be owned by analysts, who spend little of their time on IT housekeeping and most of their time analysing data and making predictions upon which to base business decisions.

Analysis
A retrospective and prescriptive BI system is much less likely to be placed to do this than a Predictive Data Science programme.

Business value
Analysis of data should inform business decisions in the best interests of the company, which means demonstrating value in the here and now and predicting it in future. Data Science is much better placed to do this than BI.",6,18

I am a Dartmouth junior, with a 3.67 GPA, who is majoring in Quantitative Social Science and intend to apply to a Data Science Masters Program. One option that I am leaning towards is the QBS Masters of Science degree in Health Data Science, which is offered by Geisel Medical School. (https://www.dartmouth.edu/~qbs/program/the-ms-curriculum.html). This requires me to take 3 graduate level courses as an undergrad, has no GRE requirement, and will let me graduate in one year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
I was wondering if it would be worth my time to take the GRE and apply to other Data Science Masters Programs. Because most of the data science programs are very new, I have no idea how competitive or prestigious any of these programs are. There have been a variety of schools within the past two years that have come out with data science masters like Harvard, 


--------------------------------------------------------------------
For some context, I have a lot of student debt and will not consider any programs that take 2 years or longer to finish. I am also not super interested in the health aspects of data science (more indifferent). I am currently working as a Data Science Intern for a large private company in New Hampshire.

**TLDR: Can anyone recommend any masters programs that are about 1 year in length and are equivalent or better than Geisel's QBS Masters of Science degree in Health Data Science?**

They're looking for:

* 2+ years of experience analyzing data to solve business and technical problems 
* Experience in Python is a plus
* Familiarity with SQL
* Advanced experience in Tableau
* Experience in network-monitoring software is a plus

What's confusing me is that they want someone with experience, but only need some familiarity with SQL and Python experience *is a plus?* I was under the assumption that those skills were pretty necessary for someone working in Data Analysis, right? I don't understand how someone with experience as a DA doesn't have fairly robust knowledge of Python and SQL. Does this sound like a entry-level position? Maybe it was written by HR and the desired skill-set wasn't properly communicated to him/her. 

Side-note: If I sound like I don't know what I'm talking about, it's because I really don't. I graduated last year and my background is in electrical engineering and physics. I've got math chops, have a little experience in Python, SQL, and network-monitoring tools. No experience in Tableau, so I bought a subscription and will learn what I can before.

I figured I'd share my experience with doing the [Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/tracks/data-science/) for everyone in case anyone was interested in taking it.

Overall, I did enjoy the course and learned quite a lot. However, there was one annoyance I had with it and that was when they taught the math parts of it, specifically in the machine learning modules. I believe it's not the best way to teach math by showing formulas and then going through what each variable and symbol means. Honestly, you could just skip those videos and watch the demos. The demo videos were helpful and they help prepare you for the labs and exams.

All in all, I wouldn't pay for verified certificates unless you need to for your employer or they are willing to reimburse you for it, as it will cost a total of $990. If you do decide to pay for it, definitely audit the course first and make sure you know you'll pass before purchasing the certificate.

I've already done some basic ground work by taking ""Machine Learning A-Z"" on udemy and I have read ""Data Science for Business"", but I think I might need to get more rigorous with the machine learning side of things. This means I have at least used most models that you can find on packages like SKlearn and I understand how they work on an intuitive level.

(I also have ""Computer Age Statistical Inference on my Shelf and I manged to download EoSL and ISLR before my library access at my university expired.)

I've been looking at the lectures for the MIT opencourse and while I find the lectures to be easy to follow, the textbook is quite dense and I have a hard time on the problems inside of each chapter. Obviously, if I was better at math I would be a physicist and not a chemist but I am determined to learn. I can at least follow along with the main text and with the lectures, answering the questions is where things get difficult though.



So what should I do, guys? How deep should I go and where do I go to learn?

I have a couple of stupid question that I could really need your help with. I am conducting independent research and need your advice on a couple of things. 
What I want to do: I will have two condition groups that I divide on the basis of their occupational history (though all hold the same job). I will then give them a survey (that is largely a replication of another one. It has two parts, the first is entirely Likert-scales where they are asked to express attitudes towards certain actions. The second part is where they have to write in certain self-report behaviour (mostly numbers). 


Now my question: Which survey tool should I use for this? Given that I do not want the participants to self-identify, do I just send out two different surveys?

I had a few specific questions that I asked someone in the comments, but I figured I should just edit these into my original post.

1. Do you think the book serves itself well to being read in its entirety? Or should I treat this as a ""reference"" book for when I need quick exposure to a topic. I am currently looking for the former.

2. I've read a few times that Applied Predictive Modeling would be a good followup to ISLR. Do you think this book would also be an appropriate read?

3. Do you think this book would be especially beneficial for someone seeking a career in analytics / data science? It seems to encompass a lot of topics that would give me a more well rounded understanding of statistics - but I don't know if it would be better for me to just delve into a pure ML book - or at least something aimed to be more practical.

Basically, the recommender engine finds similar previous events and incorporates pieces of information associated with those events into the overall classification model. The latter features are the ""secret sauce"" to the whole model, and as such are vital to the final product.

Most of the features are encoded on-the-fly very quickly. However, the ""secret sauce"" features require a bit of compute time -- I would say about 3-5 seconds for each row.

This model will eventually need to be consumed by a production application -- a very critical production application at that. Therefore the model cannot be a bottleneck on the larger application.

The way I'm thinking of making my model consumable by this larger system is this:

1. Spin up a minimal-yet-fault-tolerant web service that sits and waits for new ""rows"" to be classified (i.e. waits for a request).

2. Once this new request comes in (with most of the information and features available through the API -- simply requiring encoding and mapping to the features of the classifier), encode quickly the features not created through the recommender engine approach.

3. For the recommender features, have loaded in-memory the matrix and vectorizer (my Python is showing) so we can easily transform the relevant features for the recommender engine and make recommendations -- this would take less than 5 seconds, on average.

4. Now that all of the features have been created, call the already-loaded model and classify the new row.

5. Send the score back to the production service.

I got mixed up in an actuarial cult out of college and spent two years trying to do that(learned a lot of stats and finance), but I've decided I am never going to get a job in this field for reasons out of my control at the moment.


I was accepted into one masters program in data science. I will go into debt for the degree. This school claims a very high employment rate out of school. Is this worth it? 


The alternative seems to be an entry level coding position, with my portfolio I am beginning to be considered, but the expected pay is quite a bit lower (about 50K/yr. opposing 100k in the local job market). I'd welcome the problem solving, logical portion of the job compared to my current one, as well as not doing physical labor(it wears on your bones).


This is my thinking so far... datascience vs. computer science


Logical thinking - a *wash*

Mathematical/statistical work - *data science* has a definite edge

More promotions with relevant degree - round goes to *data science*

expected present value of future net worth(accounting for debt) *data science* wins by a landslide

risk - less with programming.

I would appreciate anything that would better inform my decision before I plunge money and time into grad school.

While many of them had a great work ethic, it's pretty clear that Australian institutions are mostly trying to cash in on how attractive the field is to young people right now (including myself). As such, they taught me very basic Python but failed to go into much detail. As far as I can tell, this was to ensure even the students with poor English fluency or simple inability will be able to keep up. I've been trying to teach myself aggressively, and would very much like to know what some of the key things to learn are.

Thus far I've been focusing on trying to program with Object-Orientation in mind since it seems like a major part of using Python. I've also performed some simple web-scraping in preparation for a larger project I've had an idea for that will involve some machine learning. What are the skills I'm missing out on that are absolutely vital? I'll be learning more about data wrangling and databases this coming semester, but this doesn't seem like it will make be a better coder so much as teach me about disconnected modules (and databases seem pretty unrelated to programming well and more of a design-oriented skill).

**Mathematics/Statistics:**

&amp;nbsp;


My course also involved an introduction to mathematics. I fared reasonably well, and the course covered some linear algebra, univariable calculus and multivariable calculus. I scored highly, but found that my understanding here was quite shallow. This is apparently not atypical of universities, but then most graduates don't expect to earn the amount data scientists do at the moment -- I can only assume they're trying to trick us into thinking we know enough so we pay them and leave. I can certainly do most of what they have asked of me, but have spent the summer break trying to get a better understanding of fundamental concepts. However, while this is fun sometimes, I'm not sure if I'm just wasting my time -- is it enough to simply be broadly familiar with the concepts of derivatives, integrals and gradient descent, or do I really need a strong mathematical understanding of these things? I have no issue studying them, but it is clearly a large undertaking to develop mathematical intuition and becoming competitive with computer science graduates is at the forefront of my mind as a transitioner.

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr** While I've got another 1.5 years of socially acceptable off-time to become good at this, I am very suspicious my institution is pulling shenanigans. I don't really care about this so long as I can guide my own learning. Any advice on what statistics/mathematics/programming concepts to cover? Thanks very much, guys. I'll owe anyone that replies a cup of pretentious local coffee if they're ever in Melbourne. Please let me know if I should go into more detail at any point.",0,2

Dont get me wrong, there are important strategies and tactics but with a mindset you can make decisions for yourself and your unique situations.


I propose that the most important mindset is:

**Escaping Theory Hell and heading towards Practice Heaven**


Theory hell is:

- Learning the machine learning model intricacies before you start a project

- Studying linear algebra before you learn how to code

- Delving into abstract topics before you find a real world problem you want to solve

- Learning data science approaches without context or without understanding their use


Practice Heaven is:

- Being excited about interesting problems and learn theory as you need it

- Learning to code and then appreciating the math behind it as you learn

- Building the skill of defining whys before you learn any how

- Retaining more as you learn because you understand the context of the theory


Data science came from academia but it doesnt mean that the academic approach is the best way to learn it. It can actually be a great disability in this changing landscape. So in you are in the data science journey, focus on doing to learn not learning to do and you will be ahead of most others.

I can run those algorithms locally on my machine in near real time processing about 1Gb of dataframes, however I know Pandas&amp;co wont scale as soon as the data is getting bigger than that. And I expect my app to have to process BigData after few months of life.
Im fine with the front-end and the data visualisation tools (such as D3js), but Im really struggling figuring out what could be the best solution to build the back-end and the data-storage of my app with fast performances.

Basically the workflow I need should be like this:
-read data from Database tables or BigTables
-run the analysis and the ML
-return the result as a RESTful API
-render the result on a fully customized Front-end

First of all I would like to explain what I tried to do:
Knowing Id have to scale up I switched to (Py)Spark Dataframes, and I imagined a stack like this:
-Python/Scala/Java backend
-Spark
-Yarn
-HBase/Cassandra/(a Big Data storage running on HDFS)
I studied Spark for quite a while, however Im really struggling with it; perhaps I havent studied it enough
I tried to run the algorithms on a local cluster on Hadoop but they performed awfully bad. I guessed Spark couldnt be really tested locally, so I signed up to Databricks trial (which gives you a Spark cluster of 6Gb), I ran the algorithms over there and they were better but still bad and far worse than plain Pandas.
I have to admit Im not enjoying PySpark due to the lack of some basic built-in functions (I had to write some UDFs) and some of its coding style, but it tried my best to adapt my code to the SparkDFs environment, I tried several different approaches and yet how can it be so bad performing?
So the first question actually is:
1)Assuming the code I wrote in Spark was good, could running the algorithms on Databricks give a real insight of the performances you have with Spark? Do you have to have more nodes/memory to call it a day? How can I be sure to choose Spark over something else before testing it on a production-like environment?

I noticed there are a few python libraries such as Dask to run Pandas in parallel on hdfs, and systems like Blaze
2)Can I run a similar stack in Python-only? How do you connect tools like Dask to a DB like Cassandra (or even Postgres)? Is that possible?

3)Which tools would you recommend me for the requested workflow? Has anybody tried anything like that?
I couldn't find good tutorials/courses explaining how to run analytics while reading from a database instead of a csv (I have to read structured data stored in tables).

Can anyone help me? Thank you very much in advance :)",10,15

1) What's the difference between RobustScaler and StandardScaler on sklearn? When should I use each?

2) Should I do : Raw Data -&gt; Cleaned Data -&gt; Normalization -&gt; PCA/TSNE -&gt; Clustering ? Or Should PCA come before normalization?

397,2018-2-17,2018,2,17,22,7y6ojk,Statisticians! I Need help weighting/normalizing the value of keywords in data sets,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7y6ojk/statisticians_i_need_help_weightingnormalizing/,djprochester,1518874870,"Disclaimer: I am not a statistician.


That said, im trying to determine how to weight keywords from a data set of biographies so as to determine the specifics of the biography owner's professional experience.


The data set comprises the biographies of attorneys. And in those biographies, certain keywords will be indicative of particular legal practice areas. For instance, the terms private equity, M&amp;A, acquisitions, are indicative of an attorney the practices in the private equity sector. As another example, the terms litigation, court, jury, are indicative of an attorney that practices litigation. (Like doctors, attorneys practice in different areas of the law)


Now, few attorneys solely do one specific practice area. In other words, an attorney might practice finance, structured finance, capital markets and private equity all at once. So, what Im doing is running some formulas in Excel against the cells that hold the biography's language in order to count the number of instances of keywords that are specific to a particular practice area - the thought being that more instances of practice-area-specific keywords will be indicative of more weighting toward a particular practice area.


For instance, when I run this formula it might return (32 ""private equity"" keywords), (15 ""finance"" keywords), (22 ""regulatory"" keywords - all different practice areas). Now, in a vacuum, what I would do with that information, is turn those into percentages of the whole. This means that their practice is 46% private equity, 22% finance in 32% regulatory.


The problem Im running into is that there are not an equal number of keywords for each practice area. For instance, there might be a total of 22 potential private equity keywords, 16 potential finance keywords and only eight potential regulatory keywords. And in a given search, ""private equity"" might only return 8 specific keywords, with X number of those 8 keywords, to make a total of 43 (as an example). ""Finance"" might return 14 different types of keywords, with Y number of those 14 keywords, to make a total of 31 (as an example). So, when Im simply adding the total of the keywords together after Ive run the formula, I dont think that its being accurate by using the raw numbers. I assume that I need to weight/normalize the numbers in some way shape or form.


What I had resigned to do was get an average number of keywords from the total amount of keywords from all practice areas, and then weight the totals accordingly. Below are the actual numbers that I have used. These are all of the practice areas (that I am dealing with right now), and the number immediately to the right of them is the total amount of potential keywords that would be indicative of that perspective practice area. The average number that I got from the total was 12.125. I then use an algebra equation to weight the numbers (properly). So, if the average is 12.125, I multiply the ""private equity"" total accumulated keywords by .58 (to ""normalize"" that number to the average - bring 21 down to the average). 


1. I'm not sure that this is a sound strategy. 
2. As you can see from the numbers below, there are also a couple of huge outliers  tax in particular, which is only one  and I think those are probably throwing the average way off.
3. In the instances where there are only a single instance of each keyword - let's say we get a bio that only has 1 private equity keyword, 1 tax keyword, and 1 fund formation keyword - in this instance, the single keywords do carry the same weight/value, but when we apply the normalization of the numbers, the ""profile"" get's skewed incorrectly.


(To make this digestible, I am not, at least at this moment, seeking to weight the keywords WITHIN their own category - for example, ""private equity"" is 2X as indicative of the practice ""private equity"" as the word ""acquisitions."")

Number of keywords | Weighted against the average


Private equity -------------21---- 0.58

Project development------20----0.6

Capital markets------------24----0.5

Finance---------------------17---- 0.7

Fund formation------------6---- 2

Regulatory-----------------13----0.93

Restructuring---------------8----1.5

Litigation------------------21----0.58

Tax--------------------------1----12

Intellectual property--------8----1.5

Labor and employment----8----1.5

Structured finance----------4----3

Sports and entertainment--14----0.87

Venture capital--------------9----1.35

Real estate------------------14----0.87

Insurance--------------------6---- 2

Average--------------------------12.12


In looking at these numbers, just to give an example, someone who has a very heavy tax practice might only rack up eight or nine instances of keywords in their biography. At the same time, someone who has a very heavy capital markets practice might rack up 50 total keywords in their biography. In this case, the eight tax keywords would be equally indicative of a practice area as the 50 capital markets keywords are.


So, what Im looking for is some sort of methodology in order to normalize these numbers in a way that would be accurately indicative of what each attorneys practice comprises.


I realize that this is a bit abstract and while I've done my best to communicate what Im doing and what Im looking for, I may have missed the mark. If you have any questions at all, please let me know and Ill answer them ASAP.


Thanks so much.

- they could submit links to social media .

- even if this were possible, there will be a challenge to get people to get to the website/app. Perhaps, theres a marketing campaign needed ? Maybe just after another mass shooting ?

- maybe have a requirement of minimum number of reports on a person with ability to an anonymously invite others to report a probable shooter ?

- false / vengeful and fake  reporting of  someone. Witch hunting.
- anonymity is a double edged sword. Perhaps the system should ensure identity but guarantee privacy ?
- good intentions but unexpected consequences 
-  or such attention precipitating violence

Educational Background: Graduated as Stat student years ago, got good marks but never applied the knowledge since then. Forgot most of the stuff and can only do linear regression, some hypo test and some time series stuffs.

Job Background: Data Analyst for e-commerce,  focused on Customer value and number of joins, and cost per acquisition, etc.

I have one question that needs your help:

I have been tasked to predict daily new customer joins (subscription) and monthly average joins which will be used in prediction of cost per acquisition. I have two years of daily new joins at my disposal, so I considered two models in Excel:

First one is a triple exponential smoothing one. However there is no visible seasonality (only has a trend that gradually climbs through the year and has a few spikes in major holidays), and the prediction is not good. I tried ARIMA in R and it only gave me a straight line.

I tried multivariate regression next, with the join data of same period of previous year, ""Is Weekend"", ""Jan""-""Nov"" and monthly budgets as well as daily prices (lower prices in promotion) as regression variables. This works well for products with hundreds of subscriptions daily but poorly if they only have 50 subscriptions.

I'm wondering if you guys could advise me which kind of models are well suited for my situation. I have some additional observations:

1) For some products, there is strong correlation between joins in this year and joins in previous year, so if I put the data of previous year as an input, the regression model works very well. However it is not the case for other products, and the p-value of that input is very high.

2) By observation I found out that monthly budget and promotions can explain a lot about the spikes in holidays and different ""levels"" of monthly average. However I do not know how to seperate and quantify these effects.

3) Smaller data sets are more difficult to predict, which is statistically true, but we still need to make predictions anyway. Is there anything that suits small data sets? If we cannot make daily prediction, predicting monthly average is good enough.

1)  I already have some tech skills, is it better to choose specific projects and learn on the job, or should I be doing some online courses to get theory down before attempting to apply the skills?

2)  I have an opportunity that might just get me a job if I can figure out how to model it.  I would like to describe the process below and hopefully someone can give me pointers on how to get started. 

There are essentially 3 counts:  A count of what comes in at ""A"", a count of what goes out at ""B"" (can go from B to C or from B to D), and the counts that go in at C or D.  C or D can be considered together or separately (they are 2 divisions within the second tier of processing)  Not everything that comes out of B will go on to C or D, but only the flow to C/D is relevant to this model.  It is a simple flow with 2 levels of processing.  

There are 14 data types for what comes in and goes out.  All this happens over time (about 3-8 months from in at A to out at B, then about 4-6 months until back in at C or D).  

I want to be able to chart/predict when there might be a big peak or drop coming at the C/D in point, for any of the 14 different data types.  The lag in time is what has got me stuck.  I have been using simple financial year groupings but perhaps they are just too wide given the time period for the flows.

Hopefully that makes sense.  Can anyone help me out?

I should add that I use excel or SAS (but only for basic things).

On the other hand, software engineers are concerned with designing and building software. So, a fundamental quality of a software engineer is a knack for good, solid (aesthetic?) design, optimization, readability of code, parsimony of code.

Data scientist embrace messiness and derive meaning from it; software engineers embrace structure and use it to build.

Just to give you some background, I got into data science while in college. Completed an online course to start off with and have been fascinated ever since. Worked on quite a few passion projects involving machine learning. Badly wanted to work as a data scientist after college. However, I wasn't at a great uni and there were no recruiters from analytics/data science at the career fair. Applied to a lot of places but barely got any responses and 0 interviews. Finally settled on a job as a web developer to pay the bills. I initially continued working on my data science projects in my free time. Unfortunately, my work hours became hell and I haven't had much time to get proper sleep, leave alone pursue my interests. However, I did mention my interest to  friends/contacts/family in the hopes of getting an opportunity. Recently a former colleague of mine called me. She mentioned that the firm that she works with is opening a Data Sciences and Analytics division and that they are looking for applicants. Apparently, they are looking for experience in R and machine learning specifically.  I have worked extensively in R during college and I don't think it will take me much time to brush up my coding skills in the same. However, I have been completely out of touch with algorithms and statistics. Could the good folks here kindly suggest me some resources where I can brush up my knowledge of data science (machine learning in particular), preferably from the ground up?

Since these are ordered and the classes can be changed in the future (e.g. the class corresponding to 2.35 can later be adjusted to 2.5). The number is used in a different business application. The current solution is to implement a regression model and bin the outputs to map back to classes. The model isn't incredibly accurate (~45% simple accuracy compared to low 50s when using a multilabel classifier), but the flexibility of tuning the bins for business purposes is a key factor. 

I'm trying to come up with a confidence metric that will accompany the prediction to the end user. Currently I'm thinking of creating a confidence interval and if this interval overlaps into another bin noting this. However most of the distributions of each class are quite dispersed so this would almost always be the case.

I've also thought about taking the distance from the midpoint of the bin and normalizing it over the length of the bin. Or perhaps doing the distance from the median prediction of the true class, although this is future info and could prove to be an inaccurate metric.

What would be the best path to take to have a competitive CV to get a job in this area? Would it be more interesting for me to start a masters in pure/applied math or go for a data science mba or something like it?

Would a BI internship be interesting for my resume?

And finally, what about online courses, like those from Coursera, Edx, Udacity,etc. Are they good for CV or irrelevant.
I would thank any advice.

And would like the take from non-americans too, maybe there are some differences from market to market.

I am currently a junior in undergrad majoring in a field that I would describe as a science and technology hybrid. The major focuses more on having knowledge in multiple areas, developing team skills, and project management. During our senior year we develop a capstone related to our concentrations. Most graduates from this program go on to become consultants at big firms, but that isn't really where I want to go.

My education has exposed me to Python (no in-depth OOP, but I have been exposed), some SQL, R, Access, and Excel. I have done basic coding but nothing on the level of what CS Majors do. I'm currently taking Thermodynamics II, and have taken an intro stats course, also currently taking a simulation and modeling course where statistics are used to model systems. I enjoy math, but am worried that I have not been exposed to the more difficult levels of math I always hear when data science is being discussed.

That being said, I am considering going to graduate school for data science. For those of you who have a Master's or PhD, is this higher level of education basically a necessity in order to get a job as a data scientist? Is the math required for the data science field difficult to master? I'm sorry if these questions are vague. I appreciate any feedback on this topic.",8,0

Few months ago I have started my learning path to become a data scientist. I had no prior knowledge of programing or data science, so I turned to my friends at reddit for help. After making posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/6sffln/i_want_to_become_a_data_analyst_help_me_find_my/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/7274ix/what_is_the_best_place_to_learn_sql/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7oy286/sql_for_data_science_help_on_my_learning_path/), I have dedicated myself for months and learned what you suggested.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Right now I'm at the final phase, interviewing,and since I'm not being successful as other people here seemed to be, I turn to you guys again. First of all, let me give you some starting info:
 
* I am a brazilian, 28 yr, mechanical engineer **living in London** and fully dedicated to becoming a data scientist.
* I have done the [Data Science Specialisation on Coursera](https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1519309004339000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrgbqTt6en3FPYNzsJstjm2zsokg). This is a very long course that covers from R programming to statistical inference, practical machine learning and regression models.
* I have done [sqlzoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) and [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) tutorials on SQL.
* I have developed a [portfolio](https://github.com/danilodaraujo/PORTFOLIO-DS) on github. It has 4 project atm (1 nlp, 1 Class RF, 1 Reg RF and simple one of data importing and structuring).
* Right now I'm doing the Stanford [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
This is the study path that I have followed so far. Since January I have been actively looking for **junior/graduate data scientist/analyst** roles in [reed](https://www.reed.co.uk/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) and it recruitment agencies.
 
The problem is that I feel like the response haven't exactly been overwhelming. I have done some phone screenings, but only got 1 interview with a manager (and it was by the phone). And they ended up choosing someone else with more experience.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
I usually do good in interviews, it has never been a problem for me in the past and I don't feel its a problem now (haven't done any technical interviews yet). **What am I missing here? Is it my experience? I starting to think it might be my portfolio or my past experience (which you can check [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilodaraujo/)).** Keep in mind that I'm going for junior/graduate roles.
 
**I'm legitimately trying to find ways to improve myself/my cv/my portfolio.**
 
I have done so much already, any help welcome!

Can anyone with experience give their view on when is a good time to apply for data science jobs with mid-sized companies? How many months in advance is ideal? At career fairs I've received feedback from some companies that now is too early for a Sept 2018 start date, yet at the same time my friends who chose to work with the big four as research scientists or software devs already have closed their offers. 

I don't know if I'm wasting my opportunities applying online to companies I haven't been able to meet in person or contact. I've sent messages to recruiters where applicable asking this question but have received very few replies. I'm nervous because I will need to start working as soon as I graduate and stop receiving my small stipend, and I obviously would want to start working in my intended career right out of the gate.

I'm graduating with an MSc Computer Science in August 2018 in Montreal, Canada. I've already been turned down by one mid-sized company after getting quite far in the hiring process. I suspect a small part of the reason they didn't hire me was because my start date was so far in advance.

Looking for some advice on my approach. I'm 29 and have hit of a bit of cross-roads in my life. I spent the last 7 years in industry, pursuing a lot of cost-reduction, continuous-improvement, quality improvements in the manufacturing sector. I have a few inventions and patents and papers on my resume but it looks more like an MBA candidate then a PhD candidate right now... but!

I love the data part of my job. The analysis, the problem solving using data. I'm totally self taught, but considered the best at my company at what I do. I want to do more of it and I don't want to go down a career in management. I don't care about the money and so I'm thinking of going back to school for an applied statistics PhD. I love learning (spend all my free time learning and reading) and think I'd enjoy the process of a PhD.

So far, I see three paths to get where I want to be. (Solving and researching problems in our world with data)

-Take GRE's this summer, apply to PhD. programs for 2019.

-Take a Masters in Math/Statistics for 2 years, then apply to PhD. programs. (Don't really want to do this because of cost)

-Self teach myself everything and do kaggle competitions and get hired on as a data scientist somewhere.

Is a PhD a possibility for me? Is a masters necessary before I apply? (I am extremely self-motivated and a skilled self-teacher) Can I compete as a Chemical Engineer graduate from top-40 school (graduated high honors with an A in Linear Algebra..) against all these math/stats people?",4,5

I recently graduated uni and I've been working at my first job at a startup in SF doing a mix of product data analysis and marketing data analysis. 

After about 5 months of working here, one of my biggest struggles has been being able to validate if the underlying data seems to look correct. I do a lot of query writing with SQL and get my queries validated from time to time but there appears to be inconsistencies between what my boss expects the results to be and what they are. I am one of the only ones at my company doing this and there isn't always a clear point of truth. 

I understand that data validation and accuracy is an integral part of this industry, but I feel very overwhelmed with the expectations at times. I feel as though I am a bit more junior for my role. Is this a normal feeling for an entry level candidate?

My boss is not happy with the inconsistencies and I feel that I am going to be let off soon simply because I haven't delivered up to his high expectations. I definitely want to improve but I just don't know what more I can do. I really enjoy working with data but feel lost and frustrated at times by the lack of clarity.

It looks like one of my first big projects will be on predictive maintenance (specifically on building a monitoring system for their existing models) and I wanted to get a head start. Searching my school's databases has done okay at becoming familiarized with some of the basics of PdM, but I'm wondering if anyone can help with some of the details. 

I'm not too familiar with the specifics of the data just yet, but we essentially have a stream which collects data on the position of each axis of each robot, as well as a few other attributes (I want to say current flowing through each axis? Torque? Something like that). From what I understand the models are essentially unsupervised, as its cost-prohibitive to allow failures to occur.

Anyway my three main questions are:


* 1. How would I go about creating a feedback loop for PdM?
* 2. What metrics could be used - if the data is unsupervised like I  suspect it is, then obviously accuracy/precision/recall/f1 are out. My guess so far would be to use uptime/downtime, or some sort of dollar savings relative to preventive maintenance instead of predictive. 
* 3. How best to visualize these. I'm guessing this monitoring system is intended to be client-facing, so on top of developing understandable metrics it will be important to have useful visualizations. Also interested in knowing what kinds of tools are companies using to produce these visualizations.

Thanks in advance for any help or advice. If anyone with experience in PdM can direct me toward any especially helpful papers/atricles I would really appreciate it!",2,1

I took a 3-month data science boot camp in late 2016, and on top of that, I've taken some online courses on machine learning.  

Specifically, I went through Stanford's CS231n (Computer Vision) and CS224n (Natural Language Processing) that they posted online. For those of you who don't know, Stanford's CS department basically posted all the lecture notes, assignments, and lecture videos for those two courses online so that regular people (even non-Stanford students) could go through them. Admittedly, I already knew a lot of the material they posted, and it seemed like much of those courses were sort of a cursory look at what modern day researchers in those fields are doing.  

I decided to try my hand at [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) Kaggle challenge. Specifically, it's an image segmentation challenge, and image segmentation is one of the topics CS231n touched on. I tried my hand at it and wasn't really able to get above the 10th percentile of submissions.  

I tried to look at what some other people were doing and I was shocked. I mean, these people were writing thousands of lines of code and writing incredibly complex models. It seemed like they really knew what they were doing and had a purpose to doing it. They seemed like actual CV researchers. Me, on the other hand? I was kind of just blindly fumbling around. I mean, my model was, like...50 lines of code total and pretty rudimentary.  

So I'm wondering if I'm kind of out of my depth here with some of these Kaggle challenges. Are they just meant for people with more knowledge of these topics? Are they meant for actual researchers and CV scientists, as opposed to people who just went through some courses online? Or am I just going about this challenge all wrong?  ",5,9

Im 16 credit hours from graduating. Ive held internships for my schools athletic department and a small time professional team in sports marketing capacities. Ive also done a summer consulting experience in California working with another small time professional sports team. 


Ive played sports all my life and near the end of high school I realized Id like to turn that passion of mine in to a career. Through my work at internships, Im realizing now that a marketing/management route might not be what I was meant to do. 


Ever since I took my first statistics class in high school, I loved it. Im a very average student, but it was probably one of the only classes I excelled in. I never gave any thought to majoring in computer or data science, I thought I just wanted to work in sports and that would make me happy. 


I was doing some research on internships today for marketing. There is a company locally that does industry leading work in sports analytics. I dont know exactly what it was, but it was an eye opener for me...Why would I want to do a marketing internship for an organization who does some really cool stuff? Id rather be the one doing the analytics.


So I started doing some research in what I can switch up between now and graduation to at least gain some understanding of computer science...changing my major is out of question. I can change my marketing minor to a computer science or data science/analysis minor (crammed). Graduate school can be an option.


I just want to learn about this industry, I know I have a passion for analytics. Ive never done computer science in any capacity though.


I was telling my uncle all of this over dinner recently and he explained that his brother is an EVP for an insurance company in the city and a lot of what he needs is data analysts and such. He wants me to meet him and believes he would be willing to help me out and open the door in to the industry for me. 


One day I want to work within sports analytics, but I know I cant expect that right away. I know I need to learn, work in a different industry and create a portfolio/network for myself. I get all of that. I just dont really know what my next step is.


I guess Im just at a crossroad and I really dont know what to do and would love some advice.

525,2018-2-22,2018,2,22,15,7zcxt9,Was laid off 2 months ago from my first real DS job and have 5-6 more months of money left. Have had several interviews with varying success so far...is it normal to have the first few technical interviews kinda suck and end up as a reminder of what you need to brush up on? Any advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7zcxt9/was_laid_off_2_months_ago_from_my_first_real_ds/,memes_everywhere,1519282687,"The TL;DR of my situation is I was a part of a massive layoff (&gt;90% of the workforce) at my previous company (~120 employees) where I primarily worked on deep learning/neural nets (Tensorflow) for segmentation and classification on MP4 files for about 10 months. At this point, I've got enough money for about 5-6 months, so I'm growing really worried.

As you can imagine, my work experience thus far is somewhat specialized (though I've got some pretty cutting-edge deep learning experience for my level that could be applicable anywhere). As such, my experience with the ""typical"" data science work (both algorithms and data) is lacking, so naturally I'm looking to shore those weaknesses up.

I think my resume/project experiences are solid which is why I think I've landed several interviews reasonably well, and I can generally communicate and thoroughly describe my previous work quite well, but sometimes I can stumble with some of these broad technical questions on things I've never done before; often times I have a general idea or awareness of the concepts, but falter on the specifics.

It always seems there's a few questions that would be easy to remember/consider if I had the experience/exposure but it's clear that I don't (and obviously looking to gain it). It's hard to review and remember everything, especially when my work experience has been so far and away from a lot of these topics. Vague job descriptions don't help either. I've been trying to shore up some of these weaknesses that have surfaced throughout while juggling recruiters, interviewing and applying, but so far it still feels like there's always more to shore up.

Granted I'm talking about all this over the course of those 3-4 technical interviews I'm still waiting to hear back from (but have a good feeling I sucked at) and I still have a few others coming up, but I'm really worried that I'll throw all my opportunities away eventually if it keeps happening, especially since I'm out of work and being out of it for a long time becomes more hazardous.

I could really use some advice. A few questions if anyone has the time: 

- Should I consider just finding any job, if even just tangentially related or a ""lower level"", so I can rest easier for job hunting later? Maybe even consider an easy part time job in the meantime? (retail for example...have experience in it)

I was wondering if it is possible to obtain a data analyst/data scientist position with a Bioinformatics Master's degree (especially if my undergrad degree was in Biology instead of Computer Science or Statistics). While my main career goal is to go into bioinformatics, it would be nice to have wider job opportunities in the future (especially for geographic reasons) instead of being confined to a relatively niche field (compared to general data science). Can anyone here speak to the overlap/transition between the two fields? Has anyone here had any experience transitioning into a data science role from a bioinformatics background? Do employers only look at candidates with Computer Science or Statistics academic backgrounds, or are Bioinformatics candidates considered with equal weight?",5,0

Few months ago I have started my learning path to become a data scientist. I had no prior knowledge of programing or data science, so I turned to my friends at reddit for help. After making posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/6sffln/i_want_to_become_a_data_analyst_help_me_find_my/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/7274ix/what_is_the_best_place_to_learn_sql/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7oy286/sql_for_data_science_help_on_my_learning_path/), I have dedicated myself for months and learned what you suggested.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now I'm at the final phase, interviewing,and since I'm not being successful as other people here seemed to be, I turn to you guys again. First of all, let me give you some starting info:

* I am a brazilian, 28 yr, mechanical engineer **living in London** and fully dedicated to becoming a data scientist.
* I have done the Data Science Specialisation on Coursera. This is a very long course that covers from R programming to statistical inference, practical machine learning and regression models.
* I have done sqlzoo and codeacademy tutorials on SQL.
* I have developed a portfolio on github. It has 4 project atm (1 nlp, 1 Class RF, 1 Reg RF and simple one of data importing and structuring).
* Right now I'm doing the Stanford [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.

&amp;nbsp;

This is the study path that I have followed so far. Since January I have been actively looking for **junior/graduate data scientist/analyst** roles in reed, linkedin and it recruitment agencies.
The problem is that I feel like the response haven't exactly been overwhelming. I have done some phone screenings, but only got 1 interview with a manager (and it was by the phone). And they ended up choosing someone else with more experience.

&amp;nbsp;

I usually do good in interviews, it has never been a problem for me in the past and I don't feel its a problem now (haven't done any technical interviews yet). **What am I missing here? Is it my experience? I starting to think it might be my portfolio or my past experience (which you can check [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilodaraujo/)).** Keep in mind that I'm going for junior/graduate roles.

**I'm legitimately trying to find ways to improve myself/my cv/my portfolio.**
I have done so much already, any help welcome!",5,4

In one month I will be converted over to full time with a salary of ($58k with benefits: 3 weeks vacation, 401k, dental/vision/health, 7 sick days, occasional work from home, flexible hours). I will have the same duties plus some additional duties such as conducting trainings on the various database systems we use and some safety trainings for field workers. This is an excellent offer and Im glad that theyre being so generous (especially with vacation time). 

However, my question is about entry level data science/statistics salaries. Right now Im doing a part time Masters in Applied Statistics, which I will complete in 2 years. When I look at these jobs they usually have so many requirements. It seems like the more serious statistics and data science jobs require a huge amount of knowledge: (R, SAS, Python, SQL, Tableau, programming experience, Masters degree or higher, 5+ years of experience, etc). 

Yes, the salaries are going to be high like low 6 figures for the top 10%. But my question is what kind of salaries and benefits can a graduate expect with a Masters degree and 0 years of serious statistical job experience? (Im looking for an estimate the reflects the bottom 10% or 25% of statisticians/data scientists since Im nowhere near the top 10% or even 50%). If its lower than $58k and worse benefits, it might not be worth it for me to get a job in statistics/data science, idk. Maybe its worth it in the long run. Well see in 2 years when I finish my Masters. 

If anyone is working as a statistician/data scientist/data analyst/business analyst, I would like to know how much you earned when starting out as entry level after graduating. Also, how is the working environment in your job (is it stressful? Work life balance?) And what kind of benefits do you get? Thank you for your time.

If I am missing basic concepts, it's not because I'm ignorant, I simply haven't been exposed to them yet, so please, teach me!*

I've been working on a program that combines input from various experts on MMA to predict the probability of each fighter in a match-up winning (output as American betting odds, with the eventual goal of picking bets). As I've expanded to include more sources (I'll have anywhere from 10-30 picks depending on the significance of the fight), I've noticed that some predictors seem to be below 50% accurate; this is just from eyeballing the data and evaluating small samples, I have not yet gone back and extensively evaluated individual sources.

Assuming that my hunch is right and some are picking wrong more than right, does this affect how or even if I should use their input? As it exists, there is no differentiation between the sources; every source is weighted equally and combined to reach the final output.

On one hand, this makes me feel like I'm diluting my best sources, and therefore making the implied odds less accurate.  I am only taking their input on who would win, nothing else, so 50% accuracy almost makes their input feel detrimental. In some ways, output based on only those that meet a certain standard of accuracy seems more useful.

On the other hand, picking MMA fights is HARD. There isn't a system like in most sports where each team plays a large, mostly-randomized selection of other teams, leading to occasional games that even a novice could predict the outcome of. MMA matches are each selected by an experienced matchmaker and need to be agreed on by both fighters. Essentially, a fight that's easy to predict is a poorly made match, and quite rare. In addition, because of the large variety of skills used in MMA, and the virtually infinite number of ways they can interact, even a severe underdog can find a path to victory. Because of this, the number of predictors who maintain even 55% accuracy are relatively rare, so my sample size would be quite small. Also, even if someone is wrong 60% of the time, doesn't that mean that a consensus between them and the high-quality predictors is even more significant and implies a less even matchup?



These are the solutions I see:

* A) Continue combining each source equally.

* B) Remove any sources below a certain threshold of accuracy.

* C) Sort the sources into tiers based on their accuracy, and output different odds based on the different combinations. For example, there would be one set of odds from only the most accurate of predictors, another set including mid-tier and up, and another set using everybody's input.

* D) Evaluate each source individually and weight their sway on the outputted odds according to their accuracy. This option is far from applicable as my program works currently, and modifying it to work that way would be very time-consuming, not just initially, but also to maintain. However, as my coding knowledge expands, this may become more viable, and even in its current state, there may be something I can learn from your responses to this option or some aspect of this option I can incorporate. Just, y'know, explain your reasoning, or pick a second option.

1. I am wrong - IT IS a fashionable ""new"" field, but there aren't that many jobs yet
1. Too many people have entered the field but it has peaked, and now there aren't enough jobs for everyone
1. There are lots of career options, that's why everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon
1. It's just a vague and confusing umbrella term with too many potential options
1. People are worried about their current careers not being future proof and want to switch

I need to come up with a model that learns about parking park habits (for each of the parking ""houses""), and makes recommendations per smartphone, Alexa, whatever about where to park or if there's anywhere to park, where to park best, etc.  

I could get the data from the machines since I'm working with one of the few park system manufacturers; I now need to ""clean"" the data and come up with a very very simple learning algo for a few use cases.  
The bulk of the work consists of the communication between the devices and the server sending them information about parking spot availability; the cleaning of the data; and the algorithm that predicts which spots are free.  

For the first two I should be ok with (but still am very open to suggestions). I however have no experience with ML techniques and would need help on what procedures to follow.

I had an impromptu phone interview (it was suppose to be just an informational interview) this morning and the interviewer ended up just scheduling me for the second in person interview. I haven't even sent them my resume yet. 

This internship doesn't explicitly call itself a data science internship however the description sounds very much like data science- it deals with big data and under responsibilities it lists things like ""analyze data sets for trends and insights"", ""translate data analysis into actionable insights in order to increase program performance"", ""set up data transfer, intake and cleanup protocols"", etc. Also, the interviewer mentioned data science quite a bit. When I spoke to the interviewer this morning, it sounded like the project the intern would work on is very interesting but it also sounded like they were looking for a data analyst/scientist with at least a few years experience for what they wanted to do. It was a huge project. 

However, the intern job posting is targeted towards undergrad and masters students in fields ranging from engineering to business and doesn't list any of the qualifications you would expect, like programming knowledge. It only lists things like ""experience with excel, word and power point"", ""ability to research primary and secondary sources"", ""excellent writing skills"", etc. 

They interviewer was not a technical person but rather a HR/project management type person. I tried asking what specific technical skills they were looking for but I got the sense the interviewer didn't really know the answer. When asked if they were looking for someone with R/Python experience their response was just something like ""yea, that all sounds great.""

I was initially drawn to this internship because I thought it could give me experience working with big data and skills relevant to data science without requiring extensive knowledge or an extensive profolio. I was a chemistry undergrad and am a chemistry grad student so I have limited experience working with big data and no experience with things like machine learning and etc. yet. I only have started perusing data science seriously recently- I taught myself basic R, python and SQL and am taking a data science class this semester but I still have a lot to learn. ",4,1

To give a bit of background, I've been in my current job as a Data Analyst for about 2.5 years and during that time my responsibilities have evolved quite a bit. I have also been in a part-time master's CS program (focusing on data analytics - stats, text analysis, data mining, machine learning, etc) and am about to graduate, so my skill set has increased as well. I'm pretty much the only person in my department working in an analytics role and at first I was mostly standardizing/improving data collection and automating reporting, but I have been pushing for us to focus more on formulating questions and answering them with data, so my work has been more research- and project-based for the last year or so. On these projects I am usually working with management to understand their needs, doing the research and analysis, and presenting conclusions/data/models. It usually involves a combination of SQL, R, Python, and Tableau, and can include traditional statistical analysis, data mining methods, and in the future will probably include machine learning. That said, I'm relatively new to these methods so I'm very much still learning which ones are appropriate for different tasks.

Because my role has evolved, there's an opportunity for me to do more of this work with other departments (possibly as part of a cross-departmental analytics team). I'm supposed to talk with management soon about exactly what that will mean, but it could involve a title change and I'm wondering if it's reasonable to ask for a Data Scientist title. That title obviously means different things in different places, but wanted to get y'all's thoughts on this situation. If not, is there another title I should be aiming for that puts me in position for a data scientist job in the future?

tl;dr: I work on data projects and use SQL, R, Python, Tableau to do querying, analysis, stats and data mining for predictive modeling, visualization, etc - should I ask for a Data Scientist title?",14,9

Now, I stand corrected. 

So as a part of my research, I need to collect a large set of *Benign* domain names, which come from *non-technical/old/not-so-professional web developers*.

So, the first question one may ask is why don't you use set on domains available from Alexa or [Majestic][1]? Here's why - while I can use the million top domains that Majestic/Alexa provides, chances are these domains (read websites) are built by professional teams and are really well made, if not, at-least reasonably professionally programmed. 

But under the light of my definition, *facebook.com* is as benign as [this][2] or [this][3]. So choosing the top million domain means I am somehow sacrificing on vital information that perhaps a majority of not so professionally websites possess.

My first idea was to scrap TripAdvisor for cheap hotel websites/homestays/lower reviewed ones for a plausible dataset, but then again I realised that it is illegal to do so. Now, I am running out of ways to achieve my goal. What might be a good way to collect benign domains that are not-so-famous etc.?

I'm in the role of a Data Scientist at a start up and of course that means I'm also the Data Engineer currently. I've been thinking of introducing a new technology to allow us to do real-time analytics for user dashboards rather than caching everything(which has led to many bugs). 

So far, all data is stored in MySQL, caching in Redis, and I have introduced Elasticsearch for real-time text processing. However, I wanted to introduce a new tech like Spark(that's what I'm leaning towards) for real-time numerical analysis. It is possible for me to do the basic real-time numerical things in ES currently however I'm thinking that very soon, we will wish to do more advanced analytics thus bringing in Spark now. 

Does anyone have any recommendations and/or experience? A basic example of something we will start with is having a large list of users(millions) with values attached to them and needing to sum up the values of unique users thus ignoring double counting. ",4,0

1. **Only flaired users can make new submissions without mod approval.**  Non-flaired users can comment on any submission, but any new submission of theirs must be approved by a moderator.

2. **Beginner questions about getting into Data Science may only be made to the ""beginner"" sticky submission.**  This can include those just starting out or those trying to change their career.  The sticky threads will be archived at some interval, which will be determined later.  An archival list will be kept for beginners to be directed towards.

3. **Additional moderators are required.** This is in order to facilitate quicker submission and user flair approval/rejection.

Furthermore, link and user flair categories will need to be updated to reflect these changes.  However, this may hold off until the new reddit site redesign is complete due to changes in how flair filtering works.

What is the best way to achieve this?

Just to add a little bit of info as far as my educational background: My undergrad is in Information Systems from a large public state university in Texas. My curriculum largely focused on programming (Java, Python, SQL), databases, statistics (3 courses total), and business courses (accounting, finance, etc). I also took up to cal 2 as electives because I wanted to minor in CS but never finished the minor because I was tired of being broke and was ready to graduate to get to work.

I'm now making good money (for my standards) at a financial institution and am ready to go back to school. My employer is willing to foot the bill (mostly), too. 

My options are: MS in CS, MS in Stats, or MS in Data Analytics. 

Which is my best option to get into the field? 

The quickest degree would be the MSDA (2.5 years) because I wouldn't have to take any pre-reqs since I'm caught up in my math. Stats would be the 2nd longest (3.5 maybe) because I need to take cal 3 and linear algebra as prereqs, and CS would be the longest (basically around 4.5 to 5 years) because I basically have to start from scratch up to about 30 hours and then apply for the MSCS which is another 30-36 hours. 

I'm kind of at a cross roads at the moment.

Not sure if I should take it slow, get work experience in my current position, and do the CS degree. Or because I'm no spring chicken, approaching 30 years of age, do the fast route and get the MSDA. Middle ground obviously the MS in Stats.

What do y'all think?

Edit: also, the timeframes I listed to obtain the MS degrees are based on part time attendance.",4,0

Should I go to ""XXXX"" bootcamp or go to this graduate program.  


I am currently in my first semester of grad school for data science and this is my take on the question.


Before I started grad school I took some of the on-line stuff to get myself ready.  I went through Khan Academy for stats, I did some courses through Udacity, DataCamp, and even some Lynda.   Prior to this, I went through a boot camp for Security Plus.  


My experience is the bootcamps and other online courses are great for teaching the ""how"".  How do you run a   stepside regression in R or how do you import a csv.  From the Security Plus, it was memorization of answers and test-taking strategies.  


These are worth while, but for me Grad school seems to be focused on the ""Why"".  For example yesterday in my stats class we spent 5 minutes on how to format forward, backward, or stepside regression we spent the next 2 hours discussing when, why, benefits, dangers of these models.  Why do some people like them, why do some people say to avoid them.  It was all about the ""Why"".  In another class we focus on building models, once again about half the class is focused on how to build the model in the application we are learning.  The rest of the time is focused on how to use the model, what types of problems really work well on this model and why.  When should you avoid this model?  Once again ""Why"" was the centerpiece of the discussion.


I am not saying to forsake all bootcamps and online training.  In fact this summer I plan on taking a couple to learn some more technical skills so I can apply some of the things I learned this semester.  I think each has their place based on your goals and your expectations.  I think they both work really well if you are in a position to do both.",12,19

I mean, this stuff really isn't that complicated right?  Aren't most of these lower level jobs under supervision from a senior level person to help out a bit?  

How hard is it to spend an hour or two researching how to write a few lines of SQL or a short R/Python script?  Not being familiar with how data science / analytics teams are really structured in the real world I am just confused how hard these lower level jobs could possibly be to where they feel they need to hire people with such extensive experience.

[x-post from /r/cscareerquestions],https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/80p1ga/at_the_end_of_my_rope_in_my_current_position_any/,datasciencecareerq,1519757940,"I'm a statistician by trade.  My entire academic background is in statistics, including an advanced qualification.  I have done no statistics at my current job and I'm at the end of my rope.

I've been at my current job since May 2017.  It's my second job directly out of college.  I was laid off from my first job during the ""golden handcuffs period"" (I owed them money if I quit before a year) because they didn't have any data sciencey work for me to do.  I was essentially a DBA there even though Id keep suggesting reasonable analyses and easy ways to make their infrastructure more data driven instead of heuristic.

I brought up my concerns about wanting to actually do data analysis when I took my current job, which is at a small team in a satellite office of a main office.  My boss is a very smart person with strong statistical credentials.  He's also annoyed at the lack of the statistical work, but is staying around because he expects it to show up.  This company is pretty early in the process of building serious data infrastructure.

The only statistics I've done are one quick demo analysis in the beginning and another that took a few months but was cancelled due to internal factors (I had no results at that point).  At both jobs, people are aware that I know advanced statistics, but I've always been stuck doing other work.

I have been doing literally nothing but demoware and basic dashboarding since September.  I've done some coding tasks because ""Oh you're the data guy and I'm a senior guy, do this vaguely related data thing that isn't statistics.""  I've been making mockups for PMs to show at conferences.  The work I do is *very* high visibility, but has no statistics involved, which is why I'm annoyed.  I do the work, but I've been miserable because it has very little relation to what I want to be doing.

Unlike my boss, who has a considerable resume, I have little experience actually doing statistics.  I had an internship as an undergrad where I had no mentorship and they didnt know what to do with me so they kept moving me from random task to random task, and a statistics REU where I was literally one of two students who was assigned a non-statistical project.

It's particularly frustrating because I like literally everything else about this company.  My boss is awesome, my coworkers are super nice, everyone is super positive, and I can work remotely one day a week.  I'm well paid (honestly, more than I should be given the work I've been doing) and have great benefits.

I have a performance review next month.  I'm expecting it to be fantastic given that I've repeatedly gotten compliments on my work.  There's a machine learning team that I talk to a lot (outside the context of work) that's doing a lot of work I'm interested in, like voice and image recognition.  I would like to leverage my positive performance review into being able to do more machine learning work because I like this company.  Otherwise, I will quit after I hit the one-year mark and find a job that will actually allow me to build models, rather than being a glorified dashboard and demo guy.

How should I best ask to move to machine learning when the dashboarding work I'm doing is so vital?  If they don't let me transfer teams, how can I leverage my current experience into a new job where I'm doing actual *data science*, rather than making and maintaining dashboards for other people?  I've done some coding here, and have good SQL skills, but I've found that my background in those areas has made me a ripe candidate for ""code things that manage data and do basic BI stuff"" roles, rather than the more technical, advanced statistical roles I'm interested in.  My current thought is to emphasize my statistical background, make it clear that I want to be doing *analysis* work, and to point out that I was able to handle high visibility, high impact projects that require talking to stakeholders in the past.",8,7

The speaker was Ilya Sutskever, who (along with Geoffrey Hinton and Alex Krizhevsky) started the revolution in deep learning by winning the 2012 ImageNet challenge with a convolutional neural network architecture.

The talk by Sutskever was mostly theoretical, and at the end of the talk, someone in the audience asked how Sutskever initialized his weights. His reply was the following:

""That's part of a dirty bag of tricks that nobody publishes.""

Deep learning has certainly come a long way since then. In only a matter of five years, deep learning has now reached the masses. A whole dozen deep learning frameworks (https://en.wikipedia.org//Comparison_of_deep_learning_soft) have been set up. Online courses on deep learning now include those by influential academics, such as Geoffrey Hinton (https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks), Andrew Ng (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) and Andrej Karpathy (http://cs231n.stanford.edu). Top researchers such as Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville have even published a book (http://www.deeplearningbook.org) on deep learning. Hell, we can now even train a state-of-the-art cats-and-dogs model in just 10 lines of code (see the first lecture of fast.ai).

Finally, let me recall a story from my own learning experience. In my machine learning class, we are still being taught how to train our model with good-old step-wise learning rate annealing. Jeremy Howard, on the other hand, teaches you (in the very first lecture of the 2017 fast.ai course) how to create a state-of-the-art model using ""stochastic gradient descent with restarts"" (see under the heading 'Improving our model': https://github.com///blob/master/courses/dl1/lesson1.ipynb). You cannot simply underestimate the impact this can have on learning your deep learning model.

There are two positions:

Position 1: Long data is tidy data. Each row is an observation, and each column is a discrete variable. What makes data wide is not having multiple columns for multiple variables, but having a column for each observation of a variable. So, for example, if you have survey data this is long data:

Person | Year | Q1 | Q2 | Q3
--------|----- |----- |---- | ----
Mark | 2017 | 1 | 2 | 3
Mark | 2018 | 1 | 2 | 3
Mary | 2017|  1 | 2 | 3
Mary | 2018|  1 | 2 | 3

And this is wide data:

Person | Q1-2017 | Q1-2018 | Q2-2017 | Q2-2018
--------|---------- |----------- |----------- |----------
Mark | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
Mary | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4

Position 2: both of the above data sets are wide. Wide data puts each variable in a column. Long data has to collapse the variables into a single column like so:

Person | Question | Answer | Year
-------- | --------- | -------- | ------
Mark | Q1 | 1 | 2017
Mark | Q2 | 2 | 2017
Mark | Q3 | 3 | 2017
Mark | Q1 | 1 | 2018
Mark | Q2 | 2 | 2018
Mark | Q3 | 3 | 2018

Position 2 argues that their format is the commonly understood convention of what long data is. Position 1 argues that this is a misunderstanding of what long data actually means, and that since each question is a variable, it should rightly have it's own column.

Any help would be appreciated! I was taught position 2, and thought I understood what long data is, but now am not so sure.",24,8

I'm currently working with data that has a continuous response variable, let's call it Y, that generally falls into two categories: 

In my data, Y is 0 (or very close to 0) or somewhere in the range of 1000-4000. There are a couple of entries somewhere in the middle of 0-1000, but the majority fall into one of those two categories. 

I am essentially trying to model this distribution - if I feed a new data point into my model, I would like it to predict the continuous response variable Y. 

I do not know many types of models beyond linear/logistic. Linear regression was okay, but didn't have great R^2 because, well the distribution wasn't linear. 

A logistic model directly wouldn't help me because I want to be able to predict a continuous variable.

An idea I had was to build a two part model, that first uses logistic to classify each data point into one of the two groups (0 or 1000-4000), and then run two separate linear models on each of those groups. 

Anyone have any ideas on what avenues I should explore? Apologies in advance if anything is unclear. I've searched stack exchange and couldn't find any good info, so I decided to come here:) My goal for now is pretty much just highest performance possible.
