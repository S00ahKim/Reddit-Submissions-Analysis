They were nothing special but did the job. My question, though, is 'are there any things that would make better/smarter choices for analytical purchases?'

Current plan is just to get vanilla windows laptops (possibly sans graphics cards) to load SAS, SPSS, Excel and some modelling programs onto.

As a sidenote, would there be any advantage in investing in a tower/server as a data cruncher? We normally have sets which are only 6-10m records but these can still take a while to chug through with our current setup.

Thanks.",2,5,False,self,,,,,
