I hire data scientists so I thought I would tell you what I look for when Im hiring newbies.  Experienced people are another story. 

First, you need to be able to code.  And Im more interested in hacking skills more than formal systems development. If you need a formal requirements document and 6 agile sprints to complete a data science engagement you are taking too long.  Besides, 50%-70% of your work will be taking the crappy data you are given and putting it in a form that can be analyzed. For that youll need PERL, Python, VB, etc.  After you have done it you probably dont need to do it again in the exact same way.  So you need to hack that mother.  It would be awesome if you had minions to do the shit work for you but lets face it, if you are just coming out of school you are the minion.  I knew people in grad school that got straight As but couldnt program their way out of a paper bag.  I dont want those people.  So convince me that you can write code. 

You need to understand data.  This seems to be under represented in how to be a data scientist posts but it is very important.  But  you need to have a good feel for data representation and modeling.  Sooner or later you will need to impose structure on data or the data that is given to you will be highly structured.  Being able to put your data in the correct form can make all the difference in the world when it comes to accuracy and speed of analysis.  

You need to be curious.  If you see a dead squirrel on the top floor of a parking garage and your first thought is Ewwwww, a dead squirrel I dont want you.  If you first thought is Hmmm, why did that squirrel come up here if there are no trees nearby? There isnt any squirrel food around to draw him in.   How did he die? I assume that he was hit by a car but is that really the case?  and  you go into full CSI:Rodent mode then you are someone I want to talk to.  If something slightly odd pops up during your analysis it could be your mistake, bad data or an interesting discovery.  All of these are important but if you dont notice and follow up on the initial oddity then well never know will we?  I understand if you keep that side of you under wraps around normal people.  I do as well. My friends and close relatives all think Im strange when I start wondering out loud about things like that.  If you havent read all the Sherlock Holmes stories then maybe you should.  However, that being said dont take it too far.  Ive seen stats people go down rabbit holes for weeks and come back with a set of technically correct but complete useless results.  This is especially true with big data systems.  There are an infinite number of cool but useless things you can find. Your curiosity should always be filtered though the sieve of practicality.  Just keep asking yourself if what you are investigating will ultimately be useful to the client. 

You need imagination.  There are multiple ways to approach any analytic problem and you need to be able to see most of those.  More importantly you need to be able to imagine entirely brand new problems that can be solved with the data and tools that you have.  If you only find what you are told to find you are a failure.  Convince me that you can see things that others cant.  Unless what you see are hallucinations then please keep those to yourself.  



Tell me a story.   You need to be able to convert your brilliant analysis into something that normal people can understand.  If you use the term p-value while explaining results to a client Ill dock your pay.  Unless you are lucky enough to have a client that understands all that stuff. Then by all means, geek out.  You need to have good communications skills.  You need to explain your results, why they are significant and why someone should trust them in a way that civilians understand.  You will also need to interact with clients on a continual basis since you may understand analytic techniques but you most likely wont understand the domain you are working in.  A big part of data science is learning about the business domain you are operating in. If you dont, you run the risk of embarrassing yourself by giving clients results that are obviously wrong or trivial.  My first results that I delivered to a client many years ago were horribly wrong because of some fundamentally incorrect assumptions I made about the completeness of the data that I would have known about had I asked. And they were completely obtuse.  My work product sucked and I paid the price.  

Finally, you need an area of technical analytic expertise.  This is where your background in stats, machine learning,  natural language processing, etc. comes in.  There isnt much to really say here.  If you are coming out of school  this is what your degree should be in or you need to have shown a significant project or two in these areas.  You should be able to describe how to solve a sample problem that I throw at you using your preferred technology. I expect you to be technically competent in one area and conversant in the rest. 

Hmmm, this was way longer than I thought it would be.  Hopefully it helps.  Of course additions, comments and vicious flames welcome.

So for example a node on the diagram would be labelled 'python' and the little circles extending off that would be stuff like 'numpy', 'scikit-learn', etc. I think there were categories for stuff like ML, visualization, EDA, python, regression, and the like.

I've been reading about tidy data and like using ggplot and dplyr, but I have a more philosophical question regarding tidy data. 

A Matlab table allows me to store a ""cell"" of data as an observation in a column, but this type of table can't be saved as a .csv file. Is there a better way? 

My data set is organized as a series of trials(trial 1, trial2...), each trial has variables associated with it (trial type, starting position, etc). This is simple to organize in the tidy format. 

The problem is that I would also like to store the ms resolution position of several variables for the duration of the trial (which is not the same on each trial). This is where the cell columns come in. For example, I have a column, ""Stage Position,"" where I can do plot(data.StagePosition{1}) in Matlab and it will plot the position across time for that trial. If I want to send this into R, I omit the cell columns and just save the calculated values such as maximum position, or peak velocity, which is one number per trial and works easily with a tidy data organization.

My only thought so far on how to organize this better is to have a separate table where each row is an observation of the various positions at each millisecond. Then each row in the main table would have a separate table associated with it. I'm not sure that this is better, since what I would like to be able to do is something like select a subset of trials and take the average position for the first 500ms of each trial. With the data as Matlab cells, I need a little loop to convert them to an nx500 matrix and take the average, but that is simple compared to finding and loading n files.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts for improving my organization, or if there are any details I could add to make myself clearer.

After taking the first couple Coursera courses in the Data Science specialization, I was really enjoying myself and decided that this would be a great way to learn more about data science and earn my Master's at the same time.  I applied to and was admitted to Northwestern's Predictive Analytics program for the spring quarter, starting at the end of March.

The vision is still coming together, but I figure that to differentiate us from other clubs in Computer Science, Stats, and Engineering (I'd like to draw in students from all of these groups), we should focus on what it means to be a Data Scientist, the state of the field, and what tools are popular and worth learning. Our first general-body meeting is mid-March, and our first speaker is the professor of said introductory courses. The second meeting will likely be a coding marathon centered around a popular tool, likely Python and relevant libraries. If we can organize a third meeting this semester I'd like to host a company guest speaker. Once we reach a big enough audience I'd like to begin organizing competitions.

In the long run, I'd like the group to stand among the larger organizations on campus that manage to draw large crowds and strong guest speakers (especially those that are hiring).

I'm an undergrad student and I'm about to write my thesis, but I need help finding data that fits.
The idea is to observe the evolution of communities in Affiliation Networks. To observe the evolution I need a network with timestamps on the edges. I googled a lot and couldn't really find an affiliation network with timestamps such as here: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/ or http://www.barabasilab.com/rs-netdb.php. Does anybody here know other sources that might be worth looking at? I found several bipartite graphs with timestamps, such as for when a user listens to a song from a musician. My idea was, if can't find anything, to create out of this data an affiliation network of a user that likes at time t=0 the band XY and observe how/if this changes until t=1. The assumption is basically that a user isn't into a band anymore if they didn't listen to it in the next interval. In general this model is far from reality I guess, but it's a start.
I could group the data in the musician model by genre and investigate whether there is a pattern to if/how the users change there music preferences. Such that: If a new musician/band appears, does the user still listen to songs they were before, to the exclusion of the new music, or do they keep track with what is popular/new at the moment?

So I'm 25 right now and I'm currently enrolled in a ""web development"" programme at a vocational school. To be honest, I'm finding it all a bit underwhelming, the programming we do here is too easy and quite boring for me. I've started looking into data science and I think it looks very interesting, but I'm not really sure how I should proceed.. I suppose the most obvious route would be for me to switch gears and pursue a MA in Math or CS, this unfortunately isn't as easy as it sounds as I lack some of the math prereqs to get admitted to those programmes. 

Now I could get those prereqs sorted but that would take some time and I've never been very good with maths, I'm working through the Math track on KhanAcademy right now but it's taking time and I haven't moved past pre-algebra yet. 

I'm not really sure what would be most time-efficient for me to do to get into the field of data science. Right now I'm thinking maybe it is better for me to, enroll in some MOOCs in stats, ML etc and then try to do some projects on my free time. As a part of my current education programme I must do an internship next year anyhow, so I'm thinking if I can do some projects and such I might be able to get to do my internship at some place where they do data science. 

The other option is of course that I try to get my math pre-reqs in order and then go for a MA in CS or maths but I just feel like this might take me longer.",6,2,False,self,,,,,

I am a sophomore in college, to start off. This past winter I did a QA internship in a growing company in my area. It was QA, so , you know....boring stuff(subjective), but it's a job.
This did, however, open the door for me into the company, as a first internship can often do for you, and they want me back for a summer position.
I can now go into software development which I think would be ideal for me as a sophomore, or I can keep applying to other internships (specifically data science ones as I want to know if it is right for me and possibly big 5 ones) and wait it out. I do not have that much experience in Data science (i.e. scripting), but it is something I have been interested in a while as I deal with a lot of visualization at my current job.

I took an applied math class in MATLAB and we used different optimization techniques (linprog, genetic) to do like error minimization and curve fitting.
