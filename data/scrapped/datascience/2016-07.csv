I'm doing unsupervised anomaly detection.

I'm currently trying to detect outliers in a polluted set of data.

I'm using OneclassSVM in scikit learn.

I have 15 features and roughly 250,000 data points. 

Training the SVM is taking way too long. 

Does anyone have any advice on better ways to do this?  Better ML algorithms or perhaps?  Maybe use subsets of the data and average outlier results or something?

Any help would be very much appreciated!",3,6

The reason I say this is that I am enrolled in a number of online courses. Either curently enrolled of planning on enrolling.
I am enrolled in Data Science Specialization by coursera and planning on taking the Udacity Data Analysis course.
I am enrolled to start the Bigdata Course on coursera and plannin on enrolling in Udacity Machine Learning.

Here's the deal: I have made analysis of data using R. Since new data is added every minute, I need a way to run the R code and present up-to-date results whenever needed. However, people who will be using this data don't want to bother installing R and running code themselves.

Is there some way to easily (I'm more of mathematician than programmer) create some sort of app, where non-programmers could get up-to-date analysis by the click of one button?

We have tried using Apache Zeppeling for that purpose, but we are running into problems on every step.

I believe that this field will be very important in the future, but am struggling to figure out how much demand there is for this knowledge and how to use it to bring value to companies today.

On the one handall the companies that Ive worked with or have employed me seem to struggle so hard with even the most basic information management. A lot of managers see a simple pivot table as borderline wizardry, if you try to discuss anything related to ML or algorithms, you might as well be talking to a wall. Then theres rampant incompetence throughout the organization. People struggle with simple data input. Watching the day to day activities, its a god damn miracle some organizations even function. The waste is incomprehensible. I feel like theres opportunity everywhere for someone like me, with just a basic grasp of the potential benefits of good data management, to bring value to these companies.

Then I go online and see what feels like an infinite supply of far more experienced, qualified individuals who are building complex tools that I can barely understand. Any reasonable employer should want to hire any of them over me, and I feel like I have very little market value.

So the online world and the real world I am familiar with are sending me very different messages. Or maybe I just need to accept the dichotomy: It can take very little data knowledge to be effective with data in a business/management/analytics sense (there many corporate executives that make decisions based on simple spreadsheets) but at the same time someone can have immense understanding of the underlying statistics of every ML algorithm, is used to working with data on all scales, maybe even helped develop some advanced tools, and still be looking for entry level work.  

In the meantime, all I can do is try to get a little better every day; regardless of what expertise I obtain, I feel the knowledge and way of thinking promoted by understanding data science is valuable.

I managed to find some helpful responses, but there are other matters I'd appreciate getting to feedback on.

I'm 25 and wrapping up getting my master's degree in applied mathematics and have gained an interest in becoming a data analyst or similarly titled professions, but have no real familiarity with data science courses. I've seen many data analyst positions available though often times they ask for several years experience of which I have none of at the moment. 

My plan is to learn Python, SQL, and familiarize myself with a more statistical approach to Excel, then look for internships prior to getting a job being that it doesn't look likely like I can obtain a job without some experience. I have taken three statistics courses as an undergraduate, though none of which were calculus-based (not sure how greatly this matters). I will be using a textbook to study on my own time that involves Python applied to data science to see how a programming language is used in this context. I'm also still debating whether or not I should learn R. Some people seem to say Python is better or just learning one of the two languages is really all thats necessary. 

This being my situation, I'm wondering if there are other things people might recommend I do or other suggestions that they may have that I've not included. Admittedly, I feel like I didn't get a jump on this quicker and that being 25 is a bit late to just be starting off. Also, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I need to impute this information. One could use machine learning (or possibly do this only using pandas?)

Can users groupby the values of the columns to create these groups? The problem is the values are not *exact*. For the third group, column `B` has group 1, 2, 1, 1. 

It seems like the CORRECT we to unsure there are no errors is to use some sort of binning: let's say we use bin size +/- 1. Bin values A and compare with binned values from B. Based on some condition, A is the correct cluster. If not, keep comparing. 

How would you use something like sci-kit learn for this? Would you recommend k-means? 

Should I use k-means (or another clustering algorithm), or is it best to simply bin the data? ",9,2

As a 24 year-old media/PR professional who has worked with various web, email marketing, and social media analytics tools before (albeit at a very rudimentary level), I'm fascinated by the way that data increasingly influences the content that people want to see. As a lapsed journalist, it's also clear that data visualization is starting to play a bigger role in how people consume news and learn about current events.

However, in my experience, the media and PR professions (or at least the places that I've worked) are woefully behind in terms of harnessing data provided by social media and web companies, and the pay/advancement opportunities in this field are quite limited for me. Data visualization is also becoming a hot commodity in the media world, but there are few people who can combine traditional journalism skills with data viz chops to tell a compelling story (especially for the money that most media companies are willing to pay their employees.)

I'm increasingly fascinated by the career opportunities and academic/research questions posed by data scientists and think the field is extremely interesting. It's become clear to me that data science has applications that go far beyond just social media or online content. It's also clear that I have zero knowledge of what is required to break into the field.

I'm thinking of taking Coursera's Data Science MOOC to sharpen my data science/analytics skills, but I want to go a bit deeper. Is it possible to make a transition into data science as a profession, and if so, what do I need to do in order to make that happen? My math skills are average, at best, but I'm willing to do the work to beef up my skills. 

After completing a MOOC, what else would I need to do in order to deepen my knowledge? For example, I don't think an employer with data science internship opportunities would take me seriously unless I was already enrolled in a data science-related master's program or had data-related work experience under my belt. 

I'm fairly young, so I have the flexibility to do what it takes to transition into this field.

Some information on me:


* Degrees in Statistics and Political Science (both undergrad) in May 2014
* Worked 2 years as an Analyst at a fortune 50 company
* Just accepted a Data Science position at a fortune 150 company (studied a TON for many months to acquire the needed skill set)

I applied to the program when I was still looking for Data Science opportunities in an attempt to pad my resume further.  The Online program only costs $12,500 to attend; however, I am curious if it even makes sense for me to attend due to me working as a Data Scientist now. 

It seems as though conventional wisdom says that masters in Computer Science and/or Statistics are more valuable to break into Data Science; however, where do Data Science Masters fall?  What are they good for?

Since I am already working as a Data Scientist, is self-study sufficient to advancement, or is a Master's degree still necessary?  I do well learning on my own; however, I can also understand the (sometimes) importance of having an advanced degree in getting interviews.  

My current thought is to do the program since it is so cheap to add some kind of advanced degree to my name and pursue something like an MBA down the road using my employers tuition assistance program to help set me up for a manager role in the future. 

Can you all give me your thoughts and perspective?",5,7

 I feel that I have a relatively solid data science understanding - I get the core concepts and can pickup up the next concept when necessary.  I know SQL and R great.  I'm decent at Python, but it seems a lot of jobs go with either R or Python.   

Where should I go next?
- some sort of database thing?
- spark?  and where to start?  
- something else?
- hadoop?

I'm trying to compare the performance of 3 approaches, using Spark + Hive to run a complex sql query.

The **query** looks like this (nothing surprising) :  
&gt; SELECT &lt;existing columns&gt;, &lt;new columns created with IFs and operations&gt;   
&gt; FROM table   
&gt; WHERE &lt;lots of filters&gt;


The different approaches differ in the use of Spark vs Hive :  
&gt; 1. Approach 1 : load everything in Spark, and make spark run everything  
2. Approach 2 : run the WHERE in Hive, and then run the creation of the columns in Spark  
3. Approach 3 : run everything in Hive


At the moment, my pyspark code looks like this :
&gt; mytable = sqlContext.sql(""&lt;query&gt;"")  
&gt; mytable.select([...]).filter([...]).withColumn([...])

Now, my question is. If &lt;query&gt; contains **the whole query**, and I don't run line 2, will the query be executed by Hive or by Spark ?

So the most standard, back-of-the-envelope way to do this would simply be taking the total number of sales you have on day X, and then multiplying that by the remaining percentage (ex: day 15 of a 30 day month would be 30-15/15) and then adding those two numbers together (so if you're at 100 sales on the 15th you would be on pace to finish with 200 sales).

As I said, that's a pretty simplistic way of doing it. So I'm trying to refine that methodology and one of the first things I'm doing is seeing how well pacing performs historically. Say we use the example above where on the 15th we were pacing towards 200, but we actually finished with 225 sales in the month, which means the delta would be -25. But lets say instead we were pacing towards 250 sales on the 15th, meaning that the delta would be +25.

My question is, when I try to build a standard deviation off this as a first step, taking everyday of the month and seeing how the pace factored against the final result, which delta should I be looking at that will give me better accuracy in forecast my end of the month projections. Should I only be looking at how far off the pace was from the final result as a positive integer (so my 200 and 250 examples would both be evaluated as 25) or should I also be factoring in the over/under (so my 200 and 250 example would be evaluated as -25 and 25).",2,1

I would really appreciate some insight from the experts and working professionals around here.  I am strongly considering a MS in Data Science and Analytics, but i have a few questions and am quite new to the field.

Background: Majored in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Oklahoma for undergrad.  I went to work in the oilfield immediately after graduation, doing fairly technical jobs; first ""open-hole logging"" and then ""reservoir engineering"".  (both jargon terms to the non-oil&amp;gas people, basically collected petrophysical data and later used that data to perform calculations estimating Oil &amp; Gas Reserves in given areas)

I am now, like many other oilfield workers, out of a job.  I have been strongly considering a masters degree to make a big career change.  I am very interested in pursuing a career change in something computer science or strongly related to the tech field.  I have always had a strong interest in the field.  I program at probably around an intermediate level in Python as a hobby and I did some coursework in basic C for mechanical engineering undergrad.

The University of Oklahoma recently (circa 2014) started a new masters program in ""Data Science and Analytics"".  Its seems like a fairly technical program with about half the coursework out of the computer science school, and half out of the Industrial and Systems Engineering School.  The degree sheet with required courses and such can be found here http://checksheets.ou.edu/16checksheets/Data-Science-&amp;-Analytics-2016.pdf 
Another thing is the cost and time. With in-state tuition it is estimated at only $15,000 total cost.... much cheaper than the other programs around the country (Berkeley, Stanford, Georgia Tech, NC).  The program is also accomplished in only 14 months if you attend full time (I would plan do attend full time on campus).

I am hoping you guys who are much more well versed and experienced in the field could give some insight into if this program would be considered ""worthwhile"" and lead to one of the many job openings in the data field right now.

Another option would be going back to school to pursue a MS in Comp Sci... but I severely lack the necessary pre-reqs (about 25 hours) to get into the program at Oklahoma, or I assume anywhere else.  I just simply can't afford the total cost and opportunity costs to go attend school 3+ years for this option.

Thanks for any input and insight! I really do appreciate it.

TLDR:
Majored in Mechanical Engineering, worked in Oil&amp;Gas, laid-off, strongly considering MS in Data Science and Analytics to make career change.

To those who love what you're doing...I envy you and would like to start on the same path, so any input is greatly appreciated.

I double majored in intl. business and spanish back in 09' and have been in sales the last 6 years. In all reality it's not terrible, but I don't deal well with the highs and lows, and even on the most successful days (averaging top 10% performer in a F250 company) i leave uninspired with bleak thoughts on where my future is going. I also deal with random bouts of depression that can really fuck with my confidence when cold calling and overcoming objections. If you're still with me please note I am not jumping on the big data hype in chase of $$.

My highest math course was calculus and I've only taken one statistics course, but I've always been fascinated with data. I have no programming experience but want to start within the month (most time outside of work is going into prepping for the GMAT) I've always felt inferior when comparing myself to the intelligence of engineers and mathematicians. I never naturally excelled in math and science like I do in English, and my ADHD has always forced me to work twice as hard to learn at a normal rate. Fortunately, that's instilled a hard work ethic and a good attitude at taking on challenges.

I'm at a point where I'm going to hit 30 and need a major fucking change in my life. I love the business analytics side of things and want to put in the necessary time to learn the tools, skills and intuition of someone who works with data science. I am good at humbling myself and respecting those who are legitimate data scientists. I don't know how much longer I can stand working at my bullshit company with the office politics, corporate micro management and daily pressure to get hung up on and talked down to on a daily basis....so im looking for a light at the end of the tunnel.

I live in Minneapolis and have saved up a good amount of $$. Do you think any of these options are legit and give me a decent chance at re-entering the workforce in a data analyst/data science role?

1. spend 30-50k on a masters program that would start next June. Move home and immediately begin taking pre-requisite classes to take the shine off the subject. It puts me in debt but I also feel if it's a legit program the network and job placement could help. (the more research i'm doing the more this seems to be risky and unrealistic...and the most expensive....I am still a few years from paying off my undergrad debt :( )

2. move home to save $ and take coursera and other online courses, enroll in the harvard programming certificate for fall 2016 and their data science certificate in 2017, taking 4 classes per semester. Come sufficient enough to build a portfolio of projects and do this shit day/in, day out non stop until i'm competent enough for an entry level position?

3. Try to get an entry level business analyst position and take courses at night/weekends to build my skills from there. Please note this would take considerably longer and i feel a strong sense of urgency to fast track myself.

I'm currently active-duty military working as an Operations Research Analyst. I plan on separating in a year and have been working towards vectoring myself into a civilian Data Science career for the past 2 years. I have experience supporting operations overseas with data analysis and geospatial analysis. I've done some relatively simple R projects in my line of work and I more heavily use VBA.

My current qualifications:

* Some R, shell scripting, SQL, and Python experience (mostly academic projects from undergrad), more comfortable with Java and VBA.
* BS in Comp Sci, MS in Industrial Engineering, starting OMSCS at Georgia Tech this fall.
* Currently working on Big Data Specialization from UCSD via Coursera and gaining Hadoop exposure from it.
* Military experience doing data analysis supporting real-world operations
* Six Sigma Black Belt
* Experienced in Minitab

I'm looking for feedback on how I'm currently doing in terms of what additional qualifications and experience I need in order to successfully transition into this career field. I'm learning Hadoop and related tools from Coursera (military doesn't use Hadoop so I can't get experience that way). 

Also, I know there's Kaggle competitions out there but are there any other ways I can tackle on some hands-on Data Science projects in my spare time? I'm already pretty busy with Coursera, full-time work, and my current Masters. I just don't want to leave the military but be uncompetitive in this career field. 

Thanks.",3,2

So I'm going into my final year of undergrad next year, and recently (overt the past year and a half/two years) I've been doing a lot of work with Python and R for statistical analysis and research at school.   I've really been enjoying it and its why I've been becoming more and more interested in data science careers.  My undergrad degree, however, is in International Relations.  I've basically been using Python to analyze data relevant to the topics I've been researching, and have taken some stuff on Udemy/Coursera to become more familiar with the material.

I'm looking for masters programs I can apply to when I graduate.  I've been interested in cyber security for a long time and Utica College has a good online program that I've had some interest in, but I'm looking into broadening my search to DS programs...or other relevant masters I can look into.

I'd prefer that they'd be online, because that would save me relocation costs and *hopefully* allow me to get a job around where I'm located without moving and having to pay rent.  I saw UC Berkeley's program and it looked really good, but the tuition is astronomical--more expensive than my entire undergrad program.

Any help is greatly appreciated, and apologies for possibly sounding naive because this is really the beginning of my search.  Cheers!",3,4

Nothing fancy, some recoding and wrangling and looking at basic statistics, occasionally doing some basic OLS modeling. Then came about R, and Coursera, and I got really interested in this stuff and started doing stuff like CodeAcademy and trying to use R in my job. I took Linear Algebra and Multi-variable calculus (i had an econ major in undergrad) to get ready for an MS Statistics. Then I started the program (part-time) and realized I was never going to even pass my probability class because of how little math I knew, and that everyone else there was a math major or minor.

Now I have a new job with a F500 bank, still doing survey data analysis. I really love analytics and programming --- I love to build things with my code and watch them work and interpret what the results mean. I've always had a position that worked with data, but usually small data (n &lt; 50,000), so I never did ML or needed to use Hadoop.

I'd love to find a way to grow into more of a DS position, but I'm not sure how or if it's even practical. I do well financially (100k base), but I worry I won't have a job in a few years. I've thought about going back to school for an MS in DS or Business Analytics or maybe get more math classes, but it all **seems pointless** because of the competition out there and because I'd likely only be offered entry level positions.

For someone like me, who loves programming, is good at communicating analytics, and really likes statistics/math but doesn't have a ton of instruction in that area, is this even something I should be thinking about?

So I was wondering if any one is interested in working at a meet up where we do just that. One of the key tenet of deliberate practice is to get immediate feedback. And I think having a regular remote google hangout where we do that would be excellent. If anyone is interested please let me know!

Here's the deal - I'm several years into a PhD program, but certain that academia is not the career for me. With an eye towards getting some industry experience, I took this summer off from research to do a data science internship at a small tech company. The experience has been great - the work has been challenging and engaging, I have a ton of respect for the company leadership, and the other people on my team are super smart and I fit in well with them. The company is also well funded and growing quickly.
Recently, the CEO approached me to let me know that they're planning on hiring a full-time employee to take over the work I've been doing over the summer, and oh by the way we really like you and would love to have you full time.

If I go back to research, it would probably take me about a year and a half to finish the degree. If I left now, I would leave with a MS. Basically, the PhD has been a personal goal for a long time, but this opportunity is pretty close to being a perfect first full-time job.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? If so - do you think you made the right choice? Also happy to hear other perspectives.

ETA a few other potentially important pieces of information:

* The grant that supports me will run out before I can defend. It is likely that I'll be able to find another source of funding, but it's never a sure thing.

* My PhD advisor recently moved from the university where I'm a student to a different university out of state. I'm lucky enough to have work that relatively easy to do remotely, so he didn't force me to move with him. But there is some concern about his level of engagement with my project now that he's in a different place.

* There are personal reasons that make me lean toward leaving. I've been in school a long time, and I'm starting to get tired of having both no money and no free time. Also, I've definitely reached the point where I feel like I need a new challenge.

Edit 2: To everyone who took the time to comment - thank you so much for your thoughtful responses. I got way more of them than I expected, and I've read them all carefully. Ultimately it's still a really tough decision.",62,28

I am a research assistant at a law school for a number of professors.  The professors are carving out a bit of money and some time to investigate utilizing data analytics in our department.  This is an interesting opportunity for me as they are letting me kind of run with this on my own, and I've always been interested in data analysis though no real experience in the field.

Legal analytics is a fairly new field, but seems to be growing.  The analytics being done seems to be fairly simple compared to other domains, but still can be useful.

For an example of what we would be looking to do, we could say investigate product liability lawsuits and analyze the rates of success for such lawsuits in different courts, track settlement amounts, how long such cases last, etc.  This is just a rough example, but really I'm getting a lot of freedom to come up with other things to investigate and analyze.

The analytics could be useful both for academics and private practice lawyers.

The data itself would be fairly easy to get (mostly public court documents) and would not be very large in terms of a dataset.  We already have an idea of how to get and store the data in raw form (even Excel might be suitable for our purposes) but beyond that is the question.

I have some minor coding knowledge from self-learning Python and Javascript, but nothing else, and I was a liberal arts major in college.  So for first steps I'd like to ask what would be some good tools to learn for doing the analytics, and more importantly cleaning and presenting it.

Going beyond this, just to be a bit selfish, it would be nice if I can get enough knowledge and experience to make a full career leap into data analytics, if not in the domain area of law than in another field as well.",3,2

Aim: **Find a unique pattern which only the ordered users take**
Or, to be able to predict whether a user would order or not, depending on their sequential api tracking events.

Data available:  A users sequential api events:

Example:  `created profile, uploaded a pic, .`

Around 10 api events and a `ordered/not-ordered` variable 1 or 0

All those api events are the 10 recent events before the user places a food order. And for the non-ordered, I have taken the most recent events.

So, the (label-encoded)columns are as follows: 

       one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine
    0  103  103    103   103   103  103    103    103   103

We are primarily an online based company where the entire service is offered via phone, email, etc. It's a great process and is widely successful, but we still want to compete effectively on a local scale. 

How does a company educate consumers on a local scale on why their product is better? Assuming we are operating on a nationwide scale I'd assume we'd have to do a cost benefit analysis of investing x-amount of money into one area, via specific form of advertising. Though I don't think we could even measure this even if we decided to proceed with it. 

Given an example of taking out a radio or television ad, how would we measure success of this ad as an online company? Just checking to see when the ad aired in the area and seeing if conversion increased from keywords or landing page views from that area over a 2 month basis? That seems to be a little too costly for testing. 

Obviously the first thought would be improving SEO, though we already have great SEO rankings. If our target market were to do a basic search of the topic itself, it would see us. 

So I guess there are a lot of ways to go with this presentation. Probably some that I'm not seeing at all. 

Initially I want this presentation to focus on how what I do in data analysis would come into play (I use Google Analytics and Excel among other obscure analytics and SEO tools daily) to make our product stand out despite it being a niche, and educating consumers that our service exists and why were are better than competitors in some areas, and how to improve to increase conversion.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub. Please suggest elsewhere if it's more appropriate.

I am trying to fit a GMM (Gaussian mixture model) using the python SciKit-Learn library. It's pretty straightforward in all the examples can find, and I have done so successfully on a number of datasets, but I now have (I think) a unique case. 

Basically, the parameters for which I want to fit the mixture model are only implicitly defined, so there is no transform to isolate them as data. For example, I am trying to estimate a mixture model over the parameters a, b and c, which are implicit in the equation,

x^a + by^c = z,

where I do have the values for x, y and z in each observation. The actual equation is more complex, but hopefully this makes the problem clear.

So, does anyone have any tips? Code examples? Nudges in a more fruitful direction? If you have experience with solving this type of problem in all sklearn, I'd love to hear about it.

Note: I am bound to GMM as a methodology because I am trying to replicate and then improve upon a published article.

Things I have tried:

1. ""Rolling my own"" GMM by hand coding the EM Algo using numpy and scipy. This either ended in too slow code or bad convergence, so I would much prefer to find a way to hook in to the battle tested code in the sklearn library.

2. Reading about the Transformer API in sklearn. As far as I can tell, this is only meant to pre-process data, and there is not an apparent way to handle the implicit parameters problem. Am I maybe missing the purpose or correct application of the Transformer Mixin?

Thank you!

Edit: cross-posted to r/machinelearning and r/scipy.

Edit 2:

Clarified that GMM refers to a Gaussian mixture model, not to Generalized Method of Moments. I am referring to [GMM as used within the `sklearn.mixture` module](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.GMM.html).",0,3

There are also a few problems with this data:
- A lot of the fields are never filled in so the majority of some features are missing.
- We only have the current database, as soon as something is changed it's gone; no historical data
- We have next to no data on the actual users of our system, just what they use in the system
- We actually don't have much data at all, under 25,000 total entries with active and paying users being a small fraction of that

I will be graduating with a Math degree in December. I Have finished the JHU Data Science Specialization on Coursera and also in Process to finish the Big Data Specialization on Coursera.
After completion, I was thinking of doing the NanoDegrees From Udacity Both in ML and Data Analysis.
I have worked on One project involving data mining so far. And ofcourse the Coursera Capstones which have thier own Projects.
I hope to finish one more project in the following semester and the others being from online courses.
But, as i look online for jobs and entry level positions in th field. There are very few. Or none at all. They all Require a Masters or Ph.D. and also require Experience.
I have an internship in a training lab at my university where I teach Excell and R and Python. I have also thought CMS level 1 and 2. These labs are basically for the campus faculty, staff, Students, and the Community.
But I worry that these will not be enough to get me an entry level position at companies.

It might be somewhat of a silly question (and probably somewhat easy for more seasoned data geeks), so please have some mercy :D

This question has been bothering me for quite some time and is about Monte Carlo Simulations. Considering I know all the probabilities for my scenario (as I would need for a Monte Carlo Simulation/Markov Chain), I could theoretically calculate everything for the respective scenario/simulation. So whats the point in coding the entire simulation and then possibly spending money on computing the simulation.

Thanks in advance!

Edit due to confusion: ""probabilities for my scenario"" means the ex-ante probabilities I would require to correctly code the Monte Carlo simulation.",16,1

I now need to come up with a solid plan for implementing a data infrastructure for a startup with basically nothing in terms of a foundation for data science. We have a production database with details on our app. Very basic data with nothing historic.

I need to build a solid foundation for data analysis for this company. I thought it would be a good idea as an absolute base to have a data pipeline that funnels our production database dumps and our api events etc. into a data warehouse. 

I looked at data lakes, but as a base I thought they were a little too complex and overkill. This is a small company and we don't have too much data.

So my questions are...
1.) What tips, additions, subtractions etc would you suggest when building a data infrastructure from the ground up.

2.) When I talked to my companies CTO about a data warehouse, I got the feeling that he felt it wasn't all that useful and a little overkill. He also brought up a question about the architecture:

When an event happens, you save that, but do you also append a new line onto the end of the dimension database? 

In the case that you don't append he said that if he wanted to query for example 'How many people with subscription x were active on day y', since day y the user might have changed their subscription and so you would get people come up who weren't that subscription on the day or people not show up who were. Also if he wanted to find out how many people had 10 articles saved on day y, he would have to go back through the events effectively rolling back the values in the database to get to this amount.

My impression is that you don't append to the dimension database. Each row in the database is for example on user or one article. But this means that data will have changed by the time you make queries if you query for events that happened in the past using the fact tables. Am I missing something here?",31,8

I'm interning at a software company and I've been working on a project to generate risk scores of our client churn (turnover). I'm using a 2-state Markov Chain (No Churn, Churning). Essentially the workflow is this...

    1. Gather relevant data on clients (SaaS fee, usage, # of users...) on a monthly level

    for runs = 1000{

        2. Split data in test/train sets.
            - Stratified sampling, try to keep the proportion of good/bad accounts as in the original data
            - Trim the last three months of data from test set, save elsewhere to compare for         
              accuracy at the end

        for n_cluster = 1:9{

            3. Unsupervisedly cluster the clients into # of n_clusters
                - This way we get groupings of similar accounts
            4. Create a transition matrix per cluster
            5. Forecast three months of state probabilities for the test accounts
                - The forecasted probabilities are compared to the training set cluster's 
                  proportions
                - If {P(Not Churn) &gt;= Proportion of Not Churn --&gt; predict No Churn that month}
                   - Else{predict Churn}
            6. Compare the forecasted states to true states; get accuracy

        }
    }
    7. Select n_cluster with the highest accuracy to forecast for all current accounts, real forecast for upcoming 
    months.

Steps 2 through 6 are repeated ~1000 times to bootstrap the accuracy. We have few accounts to work with (430), so the accuracy per # of clusters can vary greatly depending on the accounts that were put into the test set. 

**Problem:** In Step 5, the model is overly optimistic... No predicted probabilities fall below the clusters' proportion and the model predicts ""No Churn"" 99.9% of the time.

So the prediction threshold needs to be adjusted somehow, but I don't know enough about Markov Chains yet (2nd year stats undergrad) to know how to edit the threshold. Maybe compare the predicted probabilities to the proportions in the entire train set?

**tl;dr** My predicted probabilities never dip below the proportion of states in the train set, so the model always predicts ""No Churn"". The threshold needs to adjusted somehow.

I've considered Apache Spark or SQL, but that'd be hard to learn compared to Python and R because you actually need a huge database to work with.

I'm trying to get better and develop a more formal process when it comes to exploratory analysis/data prep.  I know every dataset varies and it depends - but generally I'd like to have some sort of checklist to try to get 90% of the way there. 

When I search for this sort of thing all I get is lots of 'it depends' - with good reason - i understand.  I also get lots of histograms and frequency tables, sometimes a log transformation.  However, I'm really after a better process:


1.  Understand data to best you can and throughout all steps - a given, I get this.
2.  Basic Summary statistics of all fields (STDEV, quantiles, mean, # of unique values, mode, NULLs, 0s, etc).
3.  Additional summary statistics such as scatter/boxplots, data skew.
4.  Elimination of zero variance values, extreme near zero variance values. 
5.  Elimination of linear combinations.
6.  Derived variables if possible / Transformation of skewed values
7.  First pass of Feature selection techniques/models?  Lasso, Random Forest, Stepwise technique, Gradient Boosting, etc to reduce columns when makes sense?
8.  Explore applying some sort of clustering technique to see if any groupings that can be trained/tested separately.  
9. Run different models using Cross Validation.  Determine which fields have value in retaining/explore results, etc
10.  Finalize ensemble, model, and method approach?

This is how I kinda see.  I'm really just looking for some sort of checklist in a good order.  I'm always worried I missed something when I do the analysis.

I never really see any talk about this beyond 'I made some plots and frequencies' so I'm hoping this discussion helps everyone else as well!!",5,8

I joined a data analytics firm after graduating as a Mechanical engineer and realized my inclination towards Analytics and Data Science. After working couple of years as a BA I took part in a Kaggle competition (just out of curiosity) and was completely amazed by the sheer spirit and enthusiasm of the ML community there. Although didn't achieve much at that particular competition but loved the problem solving process enough to make ML my what-i-would-be-happy-to-do-for-a-living thing. 

However, I do realise that getting into a MS in CS or a PhD directly would be a pretty long shot and hence have decided to apply for data science courses instead. 

In an ideal world - After my MS in Data Science, I want to work couple of years as a data scientist (involving ML application/R&amp;D) and then get back to do the PhD. Eventually in life, I want to end up doing research as a Prof and not a corporate job. 

**My profile -**


The Good: - The 3 yrs BA experience (working in the data analytics field has actually inspired me to go one level deeper and transition into ML)


The Bad: GRE: 319 (V:155, Q:164, AWA:4.0) TOEFL: 107 CGPA: 3.20


The Ugly: - No publications - Undergrad degree in Mechanical engineering



**The Plan -**


I have completed Andrew Ng's ML course on Coursera and I have the below mentioned tasks in mind before I start my applications for Fall '17

  1. Kaggle - Pick any of the ongoing/completed competitions and showcase the methodology/performance comparison between models on any blog/github
  2. Replicate results from research papers - I have found some really cool research papers and I really want to replicate their results with some modifications. But unsure if it would be worth the effort/time and if it would even help my case

Also, in parallel to these things I am planning to complete some more online ML courses to try and get a more comprehensive understanding.

**Some of the Questions-**


  1. Does this seem like a good idea OR is there something else that I should be doing to increase my chances? 


  2. Do I even have a chance at the Top 10 or 25? 


  3. Should I retake GRE? 


  4. Should I give up looking out for grad admissions and go hunt for jobs directly?




I know this is a bit late wrt to the fall applications this year. But at this point I'm getting all out paranoid. Appreciate the help!",14,9

I've been looking at moving to the industry and apply to analytics profiles in product teams. Coming from a more math-heavy background, I realized I really needed to revise my stats.

Overall, seems like a lot of emphasis in these interviews is on doing A/B testing and 'improvement of metrics'. I was wondering if anyone who has successfully made similar transition or is involved in recruiting candidates for a similar product/data analyst profile or is himself/herself preparing for an interview could guide me in my preparation.

Let's take **Spotify as an example**.

1. Besides MAU, DAU etc how do I think about **performance metrics** (bottom-line metrics) Spotify monitors? 
2. Everyone has their own predilections while using an App, how can **quantitatively verbalize or suggest improvements** in a particular feature of the product? I'm not sure if saying *""I'd probably want to improve the Recommendations/Discover section of Spotify for better suggestions""* will be a good answer even if it is true. There must be a significant amount of tech like Deep Learning that must've been put behind it that I might not have any idea about. 
3. I've only done A/B testing on paper and have little idea about how it's done in practice. What kind of questions should I expect on **A/B Testing**?

I have a dataframe read from a CSV file in Scala.  I would like to add another column to the dataframe by two columns, perform an operation on, and then report back the result into the new column (specifically, I have a column that is latitude and one that is longitude and I would like to convert those two to the Geotrellis Point class and return the point).  

It seems like it shouldn't be that hard, but I have tried many things to no avail.

    // filter to a geographic bounding box
    val df2 = df..filter($""lat"" &gt; 40.109028).filter($""lat"" &lt; 40.116430).filter($""lon"" &lt; -88.222401).filter($""lon"" &gt; -88.230338)
    df2.describe().show()

From here, I would like to use the Geotrellis Point class to add a column where $lat and $lon are used to generate coord = Point($""lon"", $""lat"").  I tried:

    val df3 = df2.withColumn(""coord"", Point($""lon"", $""lat""))

and received the following error:

    &lt;console&gt;:44: error: type mismatch;

I want to start learn Mix Martial Arts and see if I have what it takes to be a professional fighter and I want to learn about data science subsequently.

The reason I decided to do both at once is because money isn't an issue at the moment, I'm 23 and I want to start enjoying my life in the near future.

I know that Data Science is a mesh of many different fields. I also know its up to me to convince employers that my skills are necessary. My goal is to use Data Science in conjunction with video games although I am not sure if there is a foundation for this pursuit. I would be happy doing data science for any company since I've always admired the laws of mathematics and enjoy finding patterns in the behaviors of people(from a physiological stand point).

Some of the important fields for a data scientist to know are programming, statistics, business, and machine learning. I don't have a clear understanding of what machine learning is but I think it is the process of the computer combing the data for patterns, if someone can elaborate more on what it is i would truly appreciate it.

I have learned programming in the past and was familiar with C++ and python although I have forgotten most of it due to not using the languages in over a year. I can probably relearn the syntax in a week and I understand python is a popular language for data science.

I'm interested in learning what experiences you the Data Scientists of Reddit have that you are willing to share. I'm curious about your discoveries and how you discovered what you have learned. The reason I would like to know this is so that I can begin imagining how to apply data science techniques to video games.

I would also like some guidance on what books to begin reading and what interesting newsletters might exist. I don't want to begin with programming because I have learned so many times and its a dull place for me to begin. I am also majoring in statistics and find it very interesting. The reason I don't have a degree at 23 is due to me taking a year and half off due to personal issues and a change in major from programming to math. The fields I feel I should start in are either machine learning even though it may require a strong understanding of programming, I feel I have an intuitive understanding of programming. The other field I should study is the decision process in business so I can know how to best assist them.

So if you know any interesting or informative books about machine learning or business acumen, then please let me know. 

I am currently planning to begin my studies with the book How to lie with statistics.

I'm just confused on the 'validation set' terminology and how it fits in.  Maybe I'm just missing something with the terminology since I don't see it as often in books or examples online, but is the validation set the same as the test set or is already taken care of with the cross validation?

I have been racking my brains for useful data science to apply to small farms. Surely there is some kind of contribution that data science can make to the small farmer.

Here is the best I could come up with.  None of these really strike me as worthwhile actually for this application.

Images for geographical yield of particular crops across years

What is causing parts of the farm field to be low versus high producing

Imagery at least tells you where to measure
Seed density
Soil conditions
Drainage
Fertilizer
Nutrient deficiency
Pesticide

What is the profitability of each section of field

Maybe it is sensible to remove from production a section of a field

You can upload prescriptive maps for remedies into GPS equipped tractors with variable rate technologies

Find the least amount of a substance to add to the farm which will achieve the desired output level

Predict the specific seed that best matches the specific soil

Spectral aerial photos can be used for measuring or predicting measurements of vegetation, fertilizer deficiency, topological variation

All classifiers I've seen &amp; used so far try to predict a class from a finite list. Eg if predicting what car someone will buy, the target variable would be a list of car names {car1, car2, car3,...,carN}. If the available cars (in this case) changes then the model has to be rebuilt with the new list. If a new car is added, then initially there will be very few/no observations and the retrained model is unlikely to predict that car will be purchased. Not ideal. 


I've been thinking that rather than predict which car, it might be possible to predict the cars features, eg engine size, number of seats etc, then the car prediction would be the car with the most similar features. If new cars are introduced (or old ones no longer available) that wouldn't matter. Thus far I've thought of 2 approaches.


First is to build a model predicting each feature of the target, then return the car with the smallest average distance to each target feature. Eg, 1 model for fuel economy, 1 for number of seats etc. This approach would work for features that are both continuous and categorical, eg fuel economy and car colour but seems quite inelegant, especially as the target space grows. Also, I've tried to run this approach in R, all with various errors. 


The second is to binarise my target's features, creating a large feature matrix as my target variable. For example if a car could have a combination of the following features:
    number of cylinders in {4,6,8} 
    number of seats in {2,5}. 
If carN had 6 cylinders and 2 seats it would be represented as [0,1,0,0,1]. In saying that, if binarising is unnecessary that'd also be cool, eg [6,2]. I've built some models using a binarised matrix as my target in Python using Keras on Theano, but should also work with the models present in scikit. This approach also has the issue of the target matrix growing quickly as the feature space grows. It also can't handle continuous variables unless they are first turned into groups.


My questions are:
1. Is this approach valid? Ie, are there any gaping pitfalls I've missed?
2. If valid, does anybody know of other/better ways to generalise the target variable?
3. Are there alternate methods?
4. Am I trying to bite off more that I can chew?

Any papers, blogs, tutorials, repos etc would all be much appreciated. Thanks (&amp; sorry for such a long post).",2,6

So I am on track to graduate in Spring 2017 with a Bachelors in Industrial and Systems Engineering from a top 15 public school in the US. I am unsure if it would be worthwhile for me to go for the Masters program here or not. The undergrad program has given me a solid foundation in math, statistics, programming, and operations research. Ideally, I would get a job in data science right after graduation but I don't know if I have enough experience. What I DO have on my resume, however, is an assistant research position at my school's Center for Applied Optimization (the CAO is an office within the ISE dept.) and I am currently spending my summer as a Business Development intern at a major materials supplier. A little bit of background on these two things:

The research: Our project (I work with a PhD student) involves studying the network of Facebook ""Likes"". Basically we have a large, two-column datatable of FB users paired with something that a user liked on FB (this can be websites/links/companies etc - but everything has been converted to integers). I have been calculating the degrees in/out at each node, average path length, clustering coefficients, centrality, etc. of this network all using C#. We want to compare this network to the network of FB friends as well as other social networks. I used SQL pretty extensively in the initial stages when we were figuring out what datatable we wanted to use. I will be receiving a stipend for my work this coming year and we plan on writing a paper and submitting it for publication at our school.

The internship - I am currently writing a C# program (WinForms application in Visual studio) that essentially takes in messy .csv and Excel files, cleans them up, extracts necessary information and outputs that information as a new table into a new/existing Excel file or an Access database file. SQL commands are used but its mainly the basic select and insert statements. There are hundreds of these messy files that I have to process and a lot of them take a different form than the rest, and so developing the cleaning mechanism has been hands down the biggest challenge, but I am making significant progress.

As a side note, I don't know much about python yet, but I plan on learning it and becoming fluent before graduation.

Now that you know what my experience entails, do you guys think it would be worth it to pursue the Masters in Industrial and Systems Engineering at my school? If not, do you think I could get a job in data science fresh after graduation, or would I be better off starting in data analysis/development work and then eventually trying to transition into data science. It's also worth mentioning that I will have $150,000+ in loans and would only consider the Masters program if it would really be worth my time and money. 

tl;dr Getting Bachelors in Industrial and Systems engineering soon with some decent experience but major student loans and I'm wondering if Masters program is worth it for me.

Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated!",4,0

I could really use some advice about what to look for in programs, and the various fields i should be exploring. My story is a bit complex, but i will try to keep it succinct!

my background: I have a liberal arts degree in chemistry(focus in biochem), and have been working in a molecular pathology transnational research lab for the past 4 years as a research assistant. My work largely involves extracting/cleaning/visualizing/interpreting dirty/fragmented data associated with past clinical molecular tests we have run on patients to ask research questions on (ie, does a result of &gt;5% at 30 days post diagnosis predict a higher rate of relapse, ect...). 
Up until 6 months ago, i was working my ass off trying to get into medical school. After not getting in for the second time, i took a step back and realized that I was really excited about the bioinformatics-esque based research i was doing, and extremely frustrated with our medical education system. Following a friend's advice, i started learning about data science and was blown away by the power and elegance of the tools that are being used. The more i learned, the more i realized that this is a field i want to be involved in! Since this realization (~5 months ago), i have been working overtime to learn how to program, take the GRE, and take a few classes to bulk up my resume (linear algebra, multivar calc, intro to algorithms) before i apply.

In the next 5 months or so, i need to take my vague direction of ""get a graduate degree in something data sciency""   and develop a more refined career and education path. This has proven difficult as i am constantly discovering different degree programs and career paths that involve aspects of ""data science"". One of the biggest issues i have been struggling with is: do I get a more general ""data science"" degree so i can be more applicable, or do i continue with my prior domain knowledge of chemistry/biology/medicine and get a degree in something like bioinformatics, clinical informatics, computational biology, biostatistics, ect...  At this point, there is a seemingly endless stream of new and exciting career prospects that I can see myself being happy doing, and could really use some advice about direction or things to research. I want to make sure that whatever degree i obtain (many of which will put me in debt), will gear me towards a career where i am in demand and compensated at a level where i can comfortably pay off my debt and eventually own a home (yes, i know this is vague, but in my current city, that generally means around =&gt; 80,000$). I also want to make sure to avoid the hype-based new grad programs that are popping up to cash in on the datascience buzz word. 

i apologize for the novel and I recognize that this is a fairly open ended request post. I've been feeling overwhelmed lately when trying to sift through the all of the noise and find the signal. It's my hope that reaching out and talking to as many people in data science related fields as possible can help me clarify my direction.

What are your thoughts on how I can represent new (even rarer-class) defects among older defects in the training set. My first thought is to down/upsample the data based on date prior to the current date. Is there some way to weight new defects over old?

Then it appeared as two courses, a CS109a and CS109B.  I'm guessing they realized the material was too much for one semester, which is fine.  But they also now have a placement quiz requiring what seems to require advanced understanding of statistical probability (the course only lists introductory statistics as a prerequisite).  I took the quiz and it was way over my head, although I consider myself as having intermediate stats knowledge.  

I'm curious if anyone has taken this course and can speak to the level of probability knowledge that students should have before taking this course.  Or if anyone's familiar with any developments that may have changed the direction and quality of this course.  Thanks.
