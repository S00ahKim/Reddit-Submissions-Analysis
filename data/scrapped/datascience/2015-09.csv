I don't think I want to get another pure programming job, and would like to get into big data! What is the best way for me to get into that field? Do I need a masters degree, or is learning on my own enough. Are courses on coursera, edx, udacity, etc. Worth it? Are they worth the money or should they be done for free?

I really need your honest input on my situation. It is really difficult for me to be discreet regarding my situation, and so I'll just have to be specific.

I am about to begin my MS in Applied Stat program at Teachers College, Columbia University. Teachers College is the graduate school of education - and it is debatable if it is really Columbia University or not. But they are officially the department of Education for Columbia - and all degrees are conferred by Columbia.

However, it is definitely a little different than, say being at the MA in Stats program at Columbia or the Data Science. Things have been disorganized, and I am disappointed by the mentorship thus far. 

I'm starting to really doubt if my degree will be worth it or not. I will be taking out $70k in loans - and that would scare almost anyone. I am really considering dropping out (I can still get my tuition refunded) - and applying for the Northwestern Predictive Analytics program or the Berkeley Data Science program (have heard great things about NW; Berkeley is my hometown). 

What do you guys think? Sample courseload for my current program: Applied Regression Analysis; Statistical Inference; Computational Stat; Multivariate tats; Experimental Design and Linear Models; Electives: Applied Data Science (Columbia DS Program); Machine Learning for DS (Columbia DS).

1) Do you guys think my program would be worthwhile? Note: Regardless, I am willing to take the loans out and pay them over time. However, if I am going to take out 50-70k, I want to know that the program/degree will be valuable in terms of learning and ""prestige.""

2) How difficult is it to get into the NW/Berkeley online programs? I know that is a terrible question - but for me it's important because I want to know if I have a good shot at being accepted.

Thanks for the read. Unfortunately, can't do a TLDR here - so if you have the time, please read and help me out! Thank you!",9,4

I was wondering if folks wouldn't mind giving me advice on a problem I'm facing:

My university offers ""graduate minors"" in other fields with satisfactory coursework. I'm considering finishing a CS minor, because it would only require 2 more classes. Of those 2 classes, I'm waitlisted on one, and enrolled in Machine Learning. I'm faced with 3 options. I can try and get into a required class that is full (and unrelated to data science), and complete my CS minor. I can miss out on the minor, but still take the Machine Learning class. Or I can take no classes and give myself a lot more free time and ability to focus on my research (probably resulting in an extra publication; I have 4 first-authored already and about 4-5 co-authored).

Is having CS a graduate minor on paper something that would really make a difference in me getting a job after I graduate? If not, is an extra class on machine learning really worth the added stress, or should I just bone up on that stuff with online courses after I graduate?",5,3

Take the Kepler data. Photometry is measured, i.e. photons hit CCDs. These measurements are stacked at a certain cadence, i.e. short cadence is 1 minute, long cadence is 30 minutes.
Therefore, each CCD pixel has a sum of photon events, summed per time.

From this photometric data, one creates Kepler light curves. If you see a dip in the light curve, this is a transit.
How exactly are the ""pixel time series"" created? Does one measure the output of each pixel for a target star, and then plot this? The dip in flux will measure as ""less photon events"" compared to surrounding pixels, which measure the photometry of the star.

Is this correct? I'm still not entirely sure after reading the Kepler data paper, Section 3, Photometric Analysis, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.0258v1.pdf:

""PA then robustly fits a two-dimensional surface to 4500 background pixels on each channel to estimate the sky background, which is evaluated at each target star pixel location and subtracted from the calibrated pixel values. Each target pixel time series is scanned for cosmic rays by first detrending the time series with a moving median filter with a width of five cadences (time steps) and examining the residuals for outliers compared to the MAD of the residuals for each pixel. Care is taken not to remove clusters of outliers that might be due to astrophysical signatures such as flares or transits that are intrinsic to the target star.""

Those with connections at industry meetups don't seem very interested in someone with my background, and of the extremely few seemingly promising postings I've applied to, I have not gotten so much as a response.

More than a few people have pointed out that the shortage is not at the entry level, but rather those with extensive experience. Browsing job listings on LinkedIn and my University's job board certainly makes this apparent. LinkedIn's weekly job recommendations consist mostly of positions with senior or architect in the name, and those that don't still ask for a minimum of 4 years of experience. 

There's a major career fair with a lot of big names coming up in a week, and I'm starting to wonder if I should cut my losses and refocus my efforts in learning everything I can about C# and .NET development to snag a programmer position instead. Seems programmers are always in demand, and companies are actually willing to train them up.

I like the company and their products, but they don't have any other data scientist that could show me the ropes and I am afraid of not learning as fast as I could working as a part of a bigger data science team.

This start-up is located in a large city with a very active data science community (meetup, conferences and so on) and I want to participate to some of those events in any case.

In your experience, is it still possible to keep learning in this situation, or is it really better to look for a first job in a company with a larger team?

I would like to list my pros and cons, as I see them, for potentially being hired as a data scientist, and request a discussion about what I should do over the next few months to prepare for applications, interviews, etc.


Pros:

- My thesis is heavily statistics-oriented

- My academic coursework has been primarily in machine learning and statistics

- I have done moderately well in some online data science competitions

- I know Python (and Matlab) very well, and I have a public GitHub account with a few of my favorite scripts

- I have been contributor to several IEEE publications during my studies, and the primary author on one

- I can intelligently discuss most popular machine learning and data mining algorithms and concepts

- I am very comfortable distilling this type of information and communicating it to people of all technical levels (I practice on my wife and friends regularly) 

Cons:

- Although I have a lot of experience with data and modeling in university, I haven't had much formal ""data science"" work experience (I have taken several internships over the years, but all have been very EE focused)

- Almost all of my CS knowledge has been self-taught, so I currently can't answer many of the data structures, time-space efficiency, or more complex algorithms questions straightaway 

- Along those same lines, my experience with production software, using revision control, coding conventions, etc. is all very limited

- I don't have much experience with ""big data"" technologies


All that said, I am super willing and motivated to make progress in any and all of these areas over the next few months. Does anyone have suggestions about where to start? Would any recruiters be willing to point out what they would see as the most glaring hole in my experience, if my resume were to come across your desk?",4,0

As far as I can tell, I have to create a partition for Linux, which requires allocating certain amounts of memory to each of the two partitions. How much of my hard drive do I have to allocate to Linux in order to still see some of the performance benefits of switching to it? While I do want to eventually use Linux for all of my analytics needs, I still need to allocate some space to Windows for programs that cannot easily be run on Linux.

Does anyone have any suggestions of what proportion I should set aside for each OS (and the swap space)?

The common theme in feedback I'm receiving is that I'm a great ""cultural fit"", that I'm ""technically strong"", but that I'm ""lacking experience"" or ""don't understand the wider impact"".

To me, this all translates as, ""you're just about there, but there's something not quite right"". It's very hard to take all this constructively just now. I know inside that I can do all these jobs. I know what I can do. I can get into the top 5% on any Kaggle comp. I can code quickly and efficiently. I have produced publishable research in machine learning with real commercial potential. I can read data and understand the underlying systems and signals. I'm good at bonding and forming relationships. I can arrive quickly at creative technical solutions to data problems.

But somehow, I don't come across that way. I have a tendency to blurt out statements of modesty at interviews (""anyone can do well on Kaggle, it's nothing"", ""well, you helped me in getting to the right solution""). I have a tendency to need a a bit more time to think about something when I'm nervous. I let my guard down too quickly when an interviewer starts relaxing the style of the conversation. There is just some quality about me that does not inspire confidence, no matter how much of a nice person I appear to be or what technical adeptness I show.

Or maybe there were just better candidates for all three jobs. Whatever the case, the next set of interviews must be an improvement on these last - but it's hard maintaining thick skin after three consecutive rejections.",13,3

I run an R&amp;D group for a big-ish company in the UK. I *think* that the positions are pretty attractive - cool data sets, essentially unlimited scope for research on what ever seems interesting, global set of clever people to bounce idea's around with, decent package etc etc.

Recruiting for senior roles is easy - people who know people who know people.  But I need to hire some more junior guys in a hurry and I'm actully struggling.

What I need is, in practical terms, a ""data monkey"" - someone who can munge and crunch some data, cobble together the odd one page website for demos, write a bit of python and do some fairly standard data science type work. In terms of time splits, it would be something like:


30% - doing monkey work - munging data, writing utilities and picking up and fixing what ever the sales guys have promised a client this week - usually sorting out spreadsheets full of data.

40% - doing more solid data research onb longer term topics.

30% - more ""flight of fancy"" stuff - pretty much undirected time on what ever floats their boat.

Heres my issue - how do I find people to do this? That sort of work above doesn't easily fit into a standard job advert..... ""Wanted - someone who can be trusted to do decent work with data, can programme to an acceptable degree, ideally in python, especially for data-y type work, knows their way around other tools, can cobble together a web page and draw an acceptable graph"" - it's bits of 3 different jobs at least.

Recruitment agents don't know how to find people who can fill that sort of role. When someone has just been naturally doing that sort of task for years, then people know them and you can find them - but they are senior positions - and they won't do the basic munging and monkey work. I have a junior position which (due to the wonders of HR groups) I have literally 3 weeks to recruit for, and I have no idea how to find ""newbies"" into this world.

For clarity - I'm not looking to rip them off and give them senior work on a junior salary - I am more than happy to train, support etc going forwards, and any junior position is absolutely able to get into any senior positon - my challenge is how do I get a list of potential candidates for those junior positions?

Just a bit of background about myself: I recently graduated with a Masters in Biostatistics. My undergraduate background was in life/medical sciences, with electives in math, statistics, and minimal computer science. I consider myself a very quick learner. I went from originally not accepted into the Master's program, to finishing almost top of the class, and am now working full time as a Statistical Analyst. 

Why do I want to explore data science? To be honest, I am not 100% sure yet! I originally entered the field of statistics because I love the applicability of statistical skills to just about everything. I love learning about different fields, and love collaborating with others. Ultimately, I really enjoy being an analytical consultant, and having the statistical knowledge has helped me with that. With the recent movement towards big data, I feel that having strong programming skills on top of statistical knowledge will be helpful, and will open many doors in the future.

With that... I am here to ask all of you for your advice! For those who are currently data scientists (especially those who were originally trained as statisticians), here are some questions:

1) What are the main differences on the job between a Statistician and a Data Scientist? 

2) What skills DEFINE a Data Scientist? Ie. some essential skills that you must have. (Eg. for a statistician it would be things like knowing how to use a statistical programming language, etc)

3) Who are Data Scientists? Ie. what backgrounds do you have, what training in school, etc.

4) As a current Data Scientist, or someone familiar with the field, where do you see the field/discipline evolving to 5/10/20 years from now?

I have been a data scientist for the past 1.5 years; I went part-time when I began my first year last month. Additionally, I have a two masters one in economics and the other in international relations. I am proficient in Python, R, D and SQL, while learning C/C++. Lastly, I am 30 years old, married and have two children (5 and 2). 

A PhD was a personal goal of mine since I was younger, though I am now contemplating the opportunity cost as well as the long-term benefit. First, the opportunity cost, working part-time and being married, all my free time is either dedicated to them or school. While I would never give up the time with them, I wonder if I am making the best use of my time learning PhD level economic/mathematical theory. This appears to be the only benefit as my math skills are not great but I understand enough to read papers and implement them on real world data.

Second, will earning a PhD have a long-term benefit for my career as a data-scientist, whether I work in industry or start my own company (DaaS style company is where I am leaning). I do not plan to go into academia as the environment is not what I imagined i.e., academia is not an environment of the promotion and sharing ideas to solve real problems, it is a competitive environment of people trying to make tenure so they hoard their ideas to themselves. Why not go into industry with better working conditions (tech culture on the west coast where I live), better pay and better quality of life (compared to an academic).  

Overall, is completing a PhD in economics going to prove beneficial in the long-run?

I need some advice as to whether to go to a ds bootcamp with a decent record and median salary of ~115 or to try to get a job as a data analyst, learn on the job, and move up the ladder. 

I am 1 year out of my PhD in Genomics and I am so over the academic route. I want to move into Data Science because I think it will be a good fit for my inquisitive mind and a good match with most of my skills (programming, stats, explaining findings to laymen, etc.). Right now my ML skills are sorely lacking and I do not have too much time to learn it at night given that my post-doc is very demanding ( I work nights and weekends).

Given this information, should I first get a job as an analyst that makes around ~90K and work my way up OR should I just attend the 16K boot camp for 3 months and hope to get a job that pays around 115? I am thinking the bootcamp but I have no idea how quickly (or slowly) things happen in the business world. Any ideas or comments are welcome.

Ohh and I calculated wage loses for the 3 months of boot camp and it will be ~43K = 16K(bootcamp) + 22.4K(90K/4 months) + 4K(living expenses).

The problem I have is that there is no one in my office that has the skill sets I want to learn. They are either engineers or finance guys and work in excel almost exclusively. When I graduated school some of the jobs that I found the most interesting were data scientist roles for big tech firms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, Glassdoor, Trulia, Zillow. I also really appreciated Sports Analytics and anything else that used Game Theory. I also would be interested in trading, or staying in my Investment Banking realm just with more data skills.

So the way I see it there are 3 paths for me to take:

* 1st Option: Stay here at my current position and try to learn everything on my own. 

Luckily here I have a data set at my disposal and plenty of ideas on what I could be using it for. I might need to brush up on the math behind regression analysis and some of the statistics but within a month or two I should be pretty fluent again after I read through my textbooks and notes. So really what I need the most help on is the technology aspect. What programs should I be using? What programming languages are best to use to manipulate this data? What database structure is best? When I build a model how will I know if it is accurate if there is no one here to review my work? What are the best tools to learn this stuff? Trial and Error? MOOCs? Since I am working in Investment Banking my work/life balance is terrible so the time I can devote to learning new skills that aren't deemed ""crucial-path"" to what we are doing right now is limited; maybe only 5-10 hours a week but realistically closer to 0-5 hours.

* 2nd Option: Go back to grad school for Economics, Math, or Statistics. Maybe Computer Science if I find it to be helpful. 

From what I've read from others who have gone back to grad school for Economics is that the research aspect of the job prepares you for much of what I want to do. On top of that I would find it very interesting and there would be plenty of people for me to bounce ideas off of and learn from (professors and students). Some problems are that my GPA was so low at my graduating university and I wasn't an all-star in my Economics classes either. This low GPA might exclude me from many grad programs, unless I can convince them that my ambition didn't kick in until after I graduated. I'm also worried about the return I would get on my investment. I'm about to finish paying off my student loans for my Bachelor's so taking out more money again just to go back to school might not be worth it, especially if the pay is the same as what I am making now (~90K, might go up to 100-120k with promotion). Do others think that the grad school route worked out for them? Do people feel that without a graduate degree in a quantitative field they will hit a wall in their careers or get passed up by others? Has anyone mastered the skills I'm looking for and been able to get a job that uses these skills without grad school?

* 3rd Option: Take a significant pay cut and work from the bottom up at tech firms (or other firms) where they value data analysis and are willing to hire someone and train them.

If I can find an entry level job that I think I will have the opportunity to learn these skills I will definitely give it a thoughtful consideration. The pay cut will be much to stomach but if the opportunity for growth is there it should be worth it and with my loans being paid off I will have an extra $1,000 a month. I would also really value having mentors that I can use to develop my skills. Problems would be that I might downgrade myself and never be able to climb back up if I don't choose the company right. I'm also afraid that I will hit a wall if I don't get an advanced degree.

So obviously I have a lot of questions and I'm not sure what to do. Any help or insights would be great. I would love to here of how others navigated their careers and what they have seen in the professional data science realm and also where they see it going in the next 10 years. Thanks for the help!

Inevitably, much time will be spent in the dirty world of scrubbing dirty data. We use Tableau, R, SQL, Python, and Excel, but no need to know all of those exact tools. Since bringing in new analysts, we have started to use a few new tools as they have introduced us to some neat tools!

However, there really isn't available data to create this model from. Most of the medical data collected around this issue focus on separate incidents aside from the one that this app is attempting to predict.

Anyway, attempted to communicate with boss on several occasions that building a predictive model without any available data is merely a hypothesis and NOT data analysis. Furthermore, I personally believe it's a bit negligent as this medical issue has serious health implications. 

Boss has said that ""you don't need data right now"" and ""you can make up some data if you absolutely need it"".... 

So, while there is a great deal of research, there isn't data. My main questions are: 1) Do I need data? 2) Can I build a model on a medical issue without data?

I am coming from a Biochemistry/Chemistry background.  I have been working as an Analytical Chemist and like everyone else I want to make a switch to data science.  I did some research and I figured that I should learn python, I heard that might come in handly lol.  I finished the code academy python course and read through python the hard way.  This is where I am stuck. 

I did some more research and found out about Galvanize and General Assembly.  I am signed up to check out program at General Assembly.  I am checking out this school because I hope it will give me some structure about learning the field.  I asked some friends that work in the tech industry at the moment and have been told to begin as a data analyst instead and work my way up as I learn more skills. Also for some god forsaken reason I wasn't required to take stats or probability as a Biochem/Chem major so I have to learn that as well.  

So I guess what I am asking is, 
1. What are you thoughts about General Assembly? If you know someone who has gone through a school like that for data science, were they worth hiring? 

2. If you all think that GA is a waste of time. What should I learn next?! I was going to go through the SQL course on codeacademy.  I was also going to keep an eye on the next udemy sale to pick up some data science classes.  Or should I just buckle down and learn the math first?!

I put a post up a week or so ago about how I hire some junior data scientists - I was actually struggling because I usually hire more senior positions. 
&amp;nbsp;

I got some *great* feedback - and thank you to everyone who commented. At the time though, I put up a comment saying that I felt that this subreddit, and others like the ML one, while great at covering SOME of the area's in data science, left gaps in other area's that really matter in real world scenarios.  I said I would write something about it.
&amp;nbsp;


I wrote an obscenely long post about it, and then it didn't post properly (operator error). So, rather than re-type that essay, I thought I would do something at a higher level and then answer questions.
&amp;nbsp;


Lets set some context first.
I work in private industry - a big(ish) UK financial services company. I do a mix of internal R&amp;D type work - stuff our own teams ask for - and stuff that clients ask for. So - everything that follows is in that context - it is a bit different if your working for a start up company. It is very different if your working in acedemia. It's very different if your working for government agencies. Keep that in mind.
&amp;nbsp;


I think this forum is awesome - I lurk every day. However, there is stuff that makes up the majority of my life and my guys life that doesn't get discussed here which - as there are so many people posting about moving into this world, and looking for jobs in this world - I think is an issue.
&amp;nbsp;


Here are some things which I think need to be discussed here more. Also - if you can show me this stuff on a CV or in an interview, it will jump you straight to the top of the pile. 
&amp;nbsp;



**1) You are ridiculously expensive - show me how you will add value.**
There is a team in every private company that all other departments fear and dread. They are called ""Finance"" and they are the bane of every managers life. They apply basic mathematics in bizarre ways, and they will constantly demand that managers either spend more or less money than they are. The managers will NEVER win.
&amp;nbsp;



When it comes to head count it boils down to profit margin. Lets say I am recruiting for a senior data scientist and will pay then $100,000 ( really - thats a bit on the low side, but it makes a simple calculation). Lets say my company runs at a 20% profit margin. In the world of Finance, this means that that person needs to add $500,000 of value- not $100,000 -  before they break even. You may think this is crazy - but that is because you are a mere mortal and do not know Finance Maths. You don't have to agree with it - you just have to live with it.
&amp;nbsp;



What does that mean for you the data guy? You need to **Get Stuff Done**. You probably aren't going to be getting your own sales leads and doing your own deals - but you need to add value. And that really means ***BEING PRAGMATIC***
&amp;nbsp;



Some work needs to be *absolutely* perfect. These are the places where you spend the extra week tweaking your model for that last .1% of accuracy. It's where you are expected to go read papers to find a new clustering algorithm that will reduce the over-fit by .5% and you get a month to try it and deal with it.
&amp;nbsp;



But - a lot of stuff doesn't need perfection. If you need to join two sets of data as a one off task, then it doesn't matter if you use SAS, a lump of PERL, bookmarks in TextPad, Excel, Python. No one cares - you just need to get it done. If you need to know whether two elements of data correlate, then often a basic regression is ""good enough"", and will save you a couple of hours.
&amp;nbsp;



*What does this mean?*
You'll know which hat you need to wear - but when you're wearing your ""just get it done"" hat - which will be more often than your ""Get it perfect"" hat - you need to a toolbag full of quick work arounds and practical methods. If something takes 100 lines of SAS, 10 lines of Python or 2 lines of Perl... don't go the SAS route. If you need to eyeball and juggle 10,000 records then you could drop it out as a set of tables with R, or you could do it in Excel. I know it's not cool - but finance don't care - so your manager doesn't - so you don't. Get good at this stuff. Be pragmatic. Know when to have a ""Good enough"" mentality. And show it.....
&amp;nbsp;



**2) Learn to deal with junk**
Real world data is, usually, rubbish. You need to be *REALLY* good at dealing with rubbish.
Examples - I have about 2 petabytes of data coming from about 8,000 sources. The absolute best raw data set has a 2% error rate. The worst has a 75% error rate. Those figures are better than a lot of other groups are dealing with. You don't get to complain or get someone else to clean it up - you need to be good at adapting to it. REALLY REALLY REALLY good.
&amp;nbsp;


That data comes in to me in perhaps 1500 schemas and formats. No provider - ever - sticks to a schema. EVER. *EVER!* So, I need to be able to join data that arrived in EBSDIC to stuff that turns up in weirdly compressed AVRO. (tip here - learn to love CSV - it's a perfect intermediate - as is an SQLite table). Looking across my data sets, I can see a minimum of 21 different data structures for Date:Time. What ever your going to do, your going to use dates and times. So - thats something you need to be slick with. Remember Point 1) - this is ""Get It Done"" stuff. 
&amp;nbsp;


Also - a lot of data science is speculative - your going to have 10 idea's for every 1 actual piece of solid work you do. For those idea's, you're usually going to need to crash a data sample together, give it an eyeballing, patch it up a bit, do some basic work and see if it's practical. That means 9 out of 10 of those tasks you do will be disposable - so just Get It Done.
&amp;nbsp;


All of this is probably best described as ""Data Monkeying"" - your not doing science - your monkeying with data. Realistically over the course of a year, you will probably spend 50% of your time doing Data Monkey work rather than real Data Science. 
&amp;nbsp;


*What does that mean?*
When i recruit a data scientist, they absolutely, completely and totally MUST be damn good data monkeys. I'm counting on you being able to do the data monkeying in 50% of your day, not 90% of your day, so that the other 50% of your day you can do the ""Data Science"" bit and actually add value - cos the Finance Team are watching...
&amp;nbsp;


It's not cool, you don't get a conference speech out of it, and it doesn't get you a bonus, but unless you are dealing with a single source of data, a good deal of your life is going to be spent dealing with this mess. You need to 1) get good at it and 2) not take too long dealing with it.
&amp;nbsp;


If I had god like powers over this Sub I would make it so that 50% or more of the posts are people trading tips, cookbooks, idea's and lots of practice data sets so they are getting good at data monkeying, rather than Data Science. Definitely less cool - but will make the biggest impact to your working lives.
&amp;nbsp;


Some examples of data monkeying: Flicking between data structures and schemas. Recasting data. parsing data. Changing time series - compressing and interpolation of time events -Spliting data. Joining data. Dealing with common types of tricky data - like names, address structures, dates, time series. blah blah blah.
&amp;nbsp;


Fastest way to get your CV to the top of the pile - make sure that I can see your data monkeying as well as your data science skills.
&amp;nbsp;


**3) Learn to tell a story and not be scary.**
Your going to work with all sorts of people - Sales, IT, Operations and lots of managers. And you will intimidate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Whether you are or not actually scary, when you walk into a room, they will automatically assume that you are the brightest person in that room and that your going to baffle them. 
&amp;nbsp;


Some people - a minority - will try and get close to you and learn from you. The vast majority will react to their intimidation by either not listening to you at all ( many managers ) or feeling annoyed by you ( most sales people). It's not anyone's fault - it's just human nature. If you break out the big words, the jargon, the acronyms and present them with a 19 page excel spreadsheet you do nothing but reinforce those pre-conceptions. Downside for you is that it's harder to rapidly climb the career ladder. Downside for your boss is that it's harder for you to show 5x or 20x your salary as value - which means more discussions with Finance ( shudder)
&amp;nbsp;



*Two easy fixes and one sneaky fix:*
**Fix 1** - Learn to tell a story. Seriously - when you tell people about your work give it a beginning, a middle and an end. ""I was asked X, I did A, B, C and D, it looks like the answer is Y"". You might not need to do this for people for people who read this sub, but this is humanising you. Another thing - put it in context ... I.e. ""A client has X as a problem... I did A, B, C and D. It looks like the answer is Y because it helps the client due to....blah blah blah..""
&amp;nbsp;




**fix 2** - present in the right way for the audience.
Some people can deal with lots of data. Some people insist on it. Some people are intimiated by it. Some people genuinely see it as you trying to hide behind a snow of nonsense.  For example - if your doing something for a finance group, or a bunch of actuaries - you NEED the 19 page spreadsheet. And you'd better be damn sure every single cell is correct. If you were presenting to a senior sales manager, then you want a few pages of Powerpoint with big diagrams and a few bullets per page maximum. Thats not because the sales guy is less clever - it's just what they need to consume information. 
&amp;nbsp;



You don't need to be a graphic designer - but you do need an acceptable grasp of displaying data. Reading FlowingData. Read blogs. Practice. Learn to make an acceptable spreadsheet. Learn to make an acceptable PowerPoint. Play with MathPlotLib/SAS-Graph/Plotly..... Again - you don't need to be amazing - you don't need to be a master data visualisation expert - ""good enough"" - but that still needs practice.
&amp;nbsp;



**Sneaky fix:** Remember how you intimidate people because they think your a genius? Ask them a question about something they know - ""What do you think the client will do with this"" or ""How will HR use this data to plan the company party?"". Give them a set of options for something even if you make them up  Doesn't matter what it is - just ask one so they can contribute. Practice doing it subtly.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


I think I'm going to run out of words soon - more in the next comment.

I am a medical doctor, and as such I have access to a lot of data.  Right now I am basically ignorant of the technical skills necessary to really sort through the data, ask questions about what the data means, and test hypotheses.  I'm not interested in full on data mining and creating publishable research--I'm more interested in learning skills like the use of R and implementing classification algorithms for my own curiosity.  Obviously, if I found something I thought was worth sharing, I'd probably do it--but that is not my primary goal.

I'm also fascinated by gambling and financial markets.  I have a lot of ideas about where there may or may not be market inefficiencies (both in financial markets and pari mutuel markets).  I'd like to acquire the skills to test my ideas on data.

I know that Stanford has an excellent reputation and so looked into the options for education there. I came across the [Mining Massive Data Sets Graduate Certificate](http://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=10555807), which seems to cover all the subjects of interest to me. However, the monetary investment is quite a lot larger than the university I am employed at.

The content of the courses from my university versus the Stanford certificate seem relatively equal, although I don't doubt that the teachers at Stanford will likely be larger (and probably more knowledgeable) figures in data science. 

So here I am wondering two things:

1) Will the education offered through the Graduate Certificate be better than the local courses?


2) Will the Graduate Certificate carry more weight on my resume?

Briefly, I work at a business school at a university.  My bosses are actually professors in 3 main fields - business, accounting, and law.  A couple of them started a research center where we track data on lawsuits against major companies and the impact on the companies caused by litigation.  We then share the data with academics throughout our university, and sometimes other schools as well.

I have a legal background so I can find pertinent legal documents, court filings, etc, make sense of them, and extract the data we need for our research.  I track the data using a software program written by the IT folks at our university specifically for our center.  It's not a massive amount of data, but fairly useful.

But ultimately I'm a glorified data entry person.  I'd like to do some more analysis with the data we have.  Come up with hypothesis, test it, present my work.  

The good thing about working at a university is my bosses are receptive to this kind of thing.  If I have free time, they are more than happy to have me kind of freelance, research stuff I want, and learn the things I need to learn.  They are even willing to pay for a couple of classes if I want to take them.

So I'm wondering what my next steps should be.  I have some basic knowledge of Python and R, but my statistics knowledge is lacking, so I'm wondering if I should study that.",4,3

I am entering my third year of college and need some advice on what to major in. I've narrowed down my options for my undergrad to either Computer Science or Computer Engineering and am leaning more towards Comp E. I just really like both the hardware and software aspects of computing and have not found any opportunities I would be shutting the door on if I went with the Comp E degree. In other words, there are areas that I couldn't get into with the Comp Sci degree (hardware, mainly), but there aren't any areas I couldn't get into with the Comp E degree (I could do software or hardware or whatever). 

Okay, but here's where the question about Data Science comes in...

I haven't been able to really decide what I want to DO in the field of computing and is therefore why I have been leaning towards Comp E, because it is the most versatile. But recently I discovered the field of Data Science and am immensely interested in becoming a Data Scientist. I eventually want to get a Master's degree as well and have observed quite an advantage in people with a Master's in the field of Data Science. 

So here's the question - is a degree in Computer Engineering fine to get into the field of data science? And when I get my Master's, should I go for Computer Engineering as well or Computer Science or something else entirely?

The school I am going to doesn't offer a Master's in Data Science. I have seen online Master's programs for Data Science, but they're $50-60,000 (yikes!). My school offers just Computer Science or Engineering Master's programs.
