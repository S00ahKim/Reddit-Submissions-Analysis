I am writing to ask for advice from you guys and girls about data science projects.

I have completed the Microsoft Data Science challenge and since then, I am looking for more projects to get my hands on and gain real world experience. My first though was to write to charities and other local business to ask for volunteering work, to see if they can provide me with data to analyze and tinker with.

Another point to make, is that I am studying all of this on my own, and getting a job in the field is not an option (yet), because of the non-existent experience, apart from the Microsoft final exam using the Cortana Intelligence suite.

I am primarily using Python / Anaconda, as well as Microsoft Azure Machine Learning in rare cases when I need more computing power for the models.

I'm trying to make a decision on how to go about my future career in data science. I've been accepted into 2 master's programs in data science programs at University of Washington and NYU. 

[Washington](https://www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu/)
Not as well known as NYU, but UW has a very solid comp sci program and I have contacted a faculty with which to work with on some AI/computer vision related research. No funding though, just 5k in scholarship aid. Seems to lack in student recruiting compared to NYU's program. Seattle is cheaper compared to NYU though. ($45k)

[NYU](http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-in-data-science/)
More established, high profile program. Was one of my top choices, but is expensive. Excellent faculty on deep learning and AI, which are areas I want to work in. No financial help at the moment, although many current students I've contacted say they work part/full time in NYC while getting their degrees. ($62k)

On top of this, I am currently interviewing for a large tech company in silicon valley (think Google/Apple type) for a data analytics/business type position. I see this as a stepping stone towards a full data scientist gig.

My goal is to work as a data scientist at a large tech company working in deep learning/machine learning. What draws me about the master's programs is the opportunity to conduct research and learn more about statistics and computer science, since that is not my background (aero/mechanical eng). I think it also sets me up better in the long run to work on things I'd like to specialize in, but of course it comes at a cost of 1.5 years of studying and tuition. 

Any thoughts?",26,3

I'm pretty excited that I'm going to be learning these things over the next few years since I enjoy working with data. Having said that , I'm curious on what you guys would recommend I focus on to start with and if there are any books/websites you recommend for learning. I'm pretty sure the first 6-9 months might suck as I'm learning but I'm gonna make a commitment to doing it as I see data being a big career field in the future. 

EDIT: Some background on me

Have a BA in economics. Worked the last few years mostly using excel for data manipulation presentation purposes and ACCESS doing queries. From what I've gotten from the job is well more than likely be doing any reports needed and ad box requests. So lots of query stuff I imagine. I would like to hopefully get into the statistical side of things at some point. I took a forecasting class my last semester in college using some program called Winrats(?) if I remember. Basically I don't have a true programming type background but I think I can learn it as I go into my career but I would like to make sure I'm well rounded.

I know this subreddit gets its fair share of career advice questions, so thanks in advance for suffering through one more.

First a little backstory:
I'm European, 31. Studied civil engineering, although after dabbling in that field for a short while, it was clear the civil part was a bad choice for me. My career is in hydrography. which means I basically hang out on boats and collect and process 3D point data for offshore projects. This involves the technical bits, troubleshooting, cleaning data, etcetera. When it comes to relevant experience in this job for programming/data science: let's say the stats used rarely are harder than means and medians, and every now and then I'd write a VBA thing to sift through some sensor data.
I've also always been a computernerd, happy to be creative with computers in all sorts of ways, especially with graphic design and 3D modeling software when I was younger. Though I never took programming seriously, I was always quick with it, had a kid's programming language called Superlogo when I was 8, was obsessed with bettering my mIRC for a while doing all sorts of scripting. But of course, never learned it properly. Maths was also always my favorite in shcool, so hey, design, programming, maths, I guess my interests are starting to point in a certain direction ;)

Having been on the lookout for a career change for a while, I decided last year to start taking programming seriously. I have since learned some web development, which I'd like to avoid because of the immature hipster clusterfuck that is JavaScript, and mainly python, which I've started to use in all kinds of ways both at work and for personal things. I realized python and databases tickled my fancy, so I started exploring the realm of data science more. I'm currently halfway through a Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, so I know some R, SQL, MongoDB, etc already as well.

Now we come to my dilemma! At the moment I live in South America with my fiance, and I'm really not fond of leaving her behind many more times to go do boat work. Because I'm also already 31, I'd like to take a leap sooner rather than later.

Where we live is also a terrible place for wages as well as opportunities, so we will move to Europe around time of the wedding early 2018. All this means that I can't start a new career until we move, and I can't afford to not start one once we get there.

Basically, I need to take the path that has the highest probability of putting me at a computer for a company upon arrival. Now, when I look at my learning path, heavenly interesting as it looks, I feel like I'm spreading myself too thin to make this goal a reality. It's got all sorts of math books, stats, more python, R, SQL, low level programming, visualization libraries, algorithms, etcetera etcetera. But honestly, I think my study plan as it is now will take me longer than I want to wait to change careers.

I'm wondering, since I'm actually partial to the programming side of things, if it wouldn't improve my chances a lot to focus on a much narrower area. I.e. pick a language and become a pure developer, rather than learning a bit of everything related to data science. I'm actually excited these days about learning a compiled language like C# or C++, so I'm wondering if it would be a better idea to just focus on that, and steer my career to data after I've transitioned from boatguy to computerguy. If I want to at least.

Hoping people in the industry can give me some advice on my dilemma here.

Seriously, thanks if you made it this far, and I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions.

I'm looking for some advice, and there is no shortage of that on the internet, I hear.  I hate reading long posts, so I'll try to keep mine short.  I'll just say who I am and what my situation is, and what I want to do.  Looking for advice on how to get there.

**Who I am:**  I have an MS in statistics.  I currently work as a data scientist at a medium-size consulting firm.  I'm very early in my career (I'm 26, about a year out of grad school).  My work involves me coding in R pretty much all day (for some projects I am unfortunately forced to work in Stata).  I've hit a wall, though.  I consider myself pretty much an expert in R.  (Everyone defines ""expert"" differently.  What I mean is, there isn't much functionality left in R that I have left to learn or care about.)  My work also involves running my scripts in parallel on an AWS server.  While my company does not use it, I am also pretty familiar with Python as a data science tool.

**What I'm looking to do:** I'm constantly trying to expand my knowledge and increase my skills to make me a more well-rounded ""data scientist"" (I love this highfalutin term, but when I started studying statistics it didn't even exist yet).  While my company does not need or use this skill very much (yet), I have my sights set on learning the intricacies of SQL.  My company will also pay for any certification exams I want.  So I began gearing towards getting Oracle SQL certified (Exam 1Z0-071).  I started looking into Oracle because it seems to be the gold standard in DBA.  However, a coworker recently told me that Microsoft also offers their own forms of SQL certification.  I'm not entirely sure what the differences are in terms of exam content or certification prestige.  Upon doing some cursory research, it also looks like Microsoft's T-SQL has some sort of integration with R (my mother tongue!), which really appeals to me.  Integration with R would also be something that would make my company more enthusiastic to let me pursue this skill.

**So:** What should I do?  And where should I start?  Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance, Reddit!",19,24

I've applied two different clustering algorithms without any results that show improvement in overall clusters.  Data cleaning and preprocessing was already done to the data, it's just the actual clustering that's not working.  So for the past few days I've worked on something only to show that these two algorithms aren't the best choice (of course I can also be wrong with my implementation or interpretation of the results).

You can see the fuzzy parts in both of the heatmaps but its more clear at image after BMIQ.
My question is what may be causing this in both of these situations.


Probes with high detection p values, probes on sex chromosomes and SNPs has been filtered.
Unfortunately some parts of the heatmaps are fuzzy and it gets worser with normalization.

I have some 1 dimensional signals and I would like to use these signals (X1, X2, X3...) to predict an associated measures Y. I figured that maybe I could use the variability/complexity of these signals (I know there is a difference but I am still in the exploratory step) before applying a model to these data (i.e. transforming X1, X2, X3... before).


So if I remember I read somewhere (but cannot figure out where) that one could use PCA to assess if a signal is more or less complex. My logic would be as follow:


- segment my signal X1 in little part (for instance 100);

- apply a PCA on the 100 samples of the signal X1;

- find 100 (or 99) components. Then go back to the signal and see how many components are need to reach a good % of variance explained. Therefore I transform my signal X1 into series of values (here 100) describing how many components would be needed to reconstruct these segment (to an acceptable level). The idea is that highly variable signal surely need more components.


Well I do not know if this method exists and if it is applicable. If anyone can help thank you!!",6,2

What are your thoughts about how I should go about analysing the data? I am currently analyzing the data with decision trees which I then cross validate and prune to make the model not overfit. I consider including:

 - Image/rules of The decision tree model **before** pruning with 50% training, 50 % testing.
  - Its precision, accuracy and recall.


 - Image/rules of The decision tree model **after** pruning with 50% training, 50 % testing.
  - Its precision, accuracy and recall.

and then increase the training and decrease the testing. Then analyze and discuss the results about which attributes that are most likely to classify a binge drinker.

What are your opinions? Anything I missed out or should include? Is it a solid plan?;)",9,1

The courses I have taken include Information Retrieval, Application based Machine Learning (No math), Probabilistic Graphical Models and Data Visualisation. I will be interning with a start up which works with mobile sensor data over the summer.

Given the above what should be my focus for the coming academic year?

1. What are some focus areas in terms of courses?
2. In terms of research what should be my focus given the courses I have already taken?
3. As an aspiring data scientist what would be general must haves for a new grad?

I've been fortunate enough to get a job offer at a company I really like, with a role I'm seriously considering taking. Its a very traditional Data Scientist role which is pretty awesome. However, the title is Data Analyst, which I don't think really suits the role for how most of the industry perceives it.  After interviewing for many jobs, and this job, and looking at the job description, I'm ok with the pay but would prefer the Scientist title. One reason I might suggest this to them (not just on their requirements) is that this role is going to be helping out many departments within the company so being specific with my title to the skill set expected I think would be beneficial to them. Is this a crazy thing to negotiate ?  I would still take the job with the original title, its not a deal breaker. ",7,1

There are so many things wrong with this blog post, I barely know where to start, but that's never stopped me before. Let's break this down a bit, shall we?

*Data scientists are creative and bring disruptive IP (intellectual property), and this can cause havoc for their company*


That's why I hired them.


*They can steal and leverage your IP, and create IP leaks.*


Which is why companies have a general counsel.


*Are not great communicators, and sometimes can be stubborn*


So you hired cats?


*Work on stuff that they like, even if it does not translate in yield, or if it is not stuff they are paid to do*


No managers on staff?


*Hate doing mundane work, and are bad at it*


They are way too expensive to have them doing mundane work anyway. Hire cheaper people for that.


*Have more career options than many employees, and are thus difficult to retain*


Pay them appropriately, challenge them often, and manage them well.


*Don't like team work,*


Mine are brilliant at team work. Perhaps hire better?


*Tend to be elitist and isolationist*


Hire better.


*Are sometimes very attached to a specific technology and don't want to try something different (they sometimes give the impression that they haven't realized the world is evolving without them)*


Are you sure you hired data scientists?


*Are not good listeners*


Seriously? Most of the ones I run across are some of the most thoughtful listeners I've ever worked with. That's how they learn from each other.


*Work for you just to save enough money to launch their company and compete with you in a couple of years*


Then my company needs an ass-kicking. If they aren't going to do it, our competitors sure as hell will.


*Are arrogant: bad impact on teams*


I'd rephrase this as ""Are smart: should probably be listened to""


*Think sales, marketing and executives are stupid*


Ummm (just kidding). If they ignore the science and go with their gut ""just because"", I'd argue that they are.


*Can do real nasty stuff if they become a disgruntled employee*


I hope you don't have any DBAs on staff then, or you're screwed. 


*Are sometimes reluctant to share their knowledge, train colleagues, or outsource to colleagues*


While some of the points have a small whiff of truth at times, I have never ever ever experienced this.


*Are not great at prioritizing*


This one is actually pretty true in some cases. This is why you hire managers.


*Are not great at switching (on-demand) from one task (coding) to another (presenting)*


I think it's more a matter of some not being able to present well to a broader audience. This is eminently trainable in almost all cases.


*Sometimes have issues working with women (especially managing or being managed by women), especially if coming from a male-dominant culture*


One third of my team are women (I'd be fine if it were higher), so I don't see this in practice.


I'm sure that there are some data scientists for which some of the above might be true. Given that, at-will employment is pretty much the default these days, so it's just not that hard to fire their ass and replace them with one of the many excellent data scientists in the world. I think the blogger's beef should be with bad managers instead.",16,54

Some deals are profitable, others are not and there is a break-even value that represents a profitable deal when it is crossed.


I have this crazy idea to score the deals based on some features in order to estimate which one is more likely to be a good one for us to have in our website.


Based on this I have a few questions:


1) Is it possible at first?

2) I am thinking about using a correlation function to discover which features has a direct influence in sales. Is this a good approach?

3) I don't know which ML algorithm I should use because I don't want to simply label/classify the deals as ""Profitable""/""Not profitable"". I want it to have a score. What should I use in this situation?


I work with Business Intelligence for quite a long time but I am just getting into this world of Data Science (ML, classification, regression, etc), and thats why it might be a simple question. I am doing my best! By the way, I am more familiar with Python...

I have recently started using the reddit API for this purpose on my local subreddit. The naive approach has been to look at a specific subreddit's top 100 posts by day. From these I gather some stats about the first 5 users who comment: average account age, average # interactions on the subreddit, average karma. 

Then I look at a suspicious post's user stats to see if it has any obvious outliers. The idea being that marketing companies will buy accounts with history to upvote and interact, but these users won't have a history on a given sub. 

I can see a lot of obvious problems with this, but it does seem to show anomalies for some suspicious posts.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what else to look for in a marketing account? A source for obvious marketing accounts would be welcome too. I think a machine learning algorithm (MLPClassifier?) could probably handle this well, but I have no idea how to create the training data.",11,24

I am currently a (junior) Remediation Project Manager for a state environmental agency. I could be a PM my whole life but would like to further my career and learn more about data science/computer science and apply statistical analysis to environmental science.
____
I graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science and have only taken several classes that utilized computing:


&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; Matlab - Computing for Engineers 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; R-Studio - Statistics / Numerical Analysis
 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; Python  Environmental Data Analysis / GIS

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; Arduino (C/C++) - Undergraduate Research Position

These courses taught me the syntax and how to program for certain applications, but I missed out on all the CS theory, data structures, algorithms, logic, etc.  
____

So my questions are:

1)	I am currently taking a course with DataCamp (Data Scientist with Python Track)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; Is this a good starting point?

2)	Should I also take the Introduction to Computer Science with HarvardX/edX

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; Will this teach me the theory or is the DataCamp course good enough?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; Is there a better way (online certificate/post-bacc in CS, Computer Engineering, Applied Statistics)?

3)	Any data scientists here with a specialization in the environmental field?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; What was/is your career track?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x25AA; What is my best option given my current career track as a Project Manager?


Thanks!

I'm trying to get an idea of the extent and purpose of programming. 

(*) What tools are most common (if such a distinction can be made).  Are you guys using BusinessObjects/Tableu type of products, or cranking through stuff with SPSS/Excel?  I guess I'm asking if the tools like BOBJ/Tableau are used in the 'real' world (as they're supposed to make Data Science analysis 'easy'), or is that really just marketing fluff.

I've got 100 more questions, but am trying to keep this light (for now).  

For some reference, I am a mid-40's employee, who has worked in the software industry for 20+ years (18 of which is with the same company).  I have an undergrad minor in Computer Science, and an MBA with an MIS specialization...this is all to say that I am technically minded, but not a developer.  Any development experience I had is old, but given some time, I'd be able to ramp back up.  (For example, I'm able to roll up my sleeves to do BS projects around the house).

At the moment, I am considering a MS Comp Sci / Data Science degree, with the intent of moving into a Data Science role - ideally with my current organization.  However, before I commit, I want to get a good feeling for what the day-to-day is like.

I am currently a Junior in college. I transferred about 2 years ago from a community college where I graduated with an Associates in Network Security. Unfortunately my college does not offer a similar program, so it took me a year to figure out whether I wanted to pursue a degree in Computer Science or Information (data) Science. I went with Information Science because I felt that the field is more practical and an upcoming field for many tech companies.

Currently, I am learning Python and this Summer I will have a lot of free time between working at a restaurant and not not doing much. I wanted to know from professionals if there are any industry certifications that I could work towards to better my resume for internships for next year. Like Cyber Security, there is A+, Network+, Security+. I've taken the classes for those and I plan to take the Network+ exam at some point this year since I've already paid for the exam voucher. But I'd like any advice possible for industry certifications I should look into that will better my knowledge in the field.

Also, I am a real estate agent too ( got my license my freshman year of college ) and I really enjoy aspects of finance and real estate modeling. I'm hoping to find a company that allows me to work with both finance or real estate and also aspects of Python. I'm local in the Maryland area, close to D.C. and Baltimore, so if you have any suggestions for jobs or internships too that would be awesome!

Thank you for reading, and I hope that you have a great day!",1,2

Now, I got my first summer internship at a insurance brokerage to help them implement data analytics. The thing Is I have no one there to mentor me, since I'm the only one there with some knowledge of it.

I think there is a lot of potential at this firm, since they don't use any data analysis yet. I've researched some interesting projects to start with, but I don't know if I will be capable of doing it:

- identify new customers
- understanding customer needs
- product development 
- risk selection / pricing
- marketing
- insurer selection 

I don't know to what extend you guys can help me but all tips or experiences are welcome!

Not sure if this is the right place for this so please let me know if you think it should go somewhere else. 

I'm working on habit building software one of the key pieces of early feedback I'm getting is that the way goals for habits are defined is confusing. 

The problem comes from having two attributes to the habit:

1. The completion goal: The # of days a week you would like to complete the habit. 

2. The habit target: If the habit you are tracking is scalar, (ie. weight, or # of pushups), the # you want to be below or above each day. E.g., I might want to do more than 10 push ups each day and want to be able to record the # of pushups that I do each day. 

This distinction is necessary for the function of the app and to be on par / exceed competitors. 

The way this is currently explained both in the interface and in the initial walkthrough (that is also available at any time by clicking a button on the interface) is visible here: http://imgur.com/a/NIg9z

So the question is, are there better terms to refer to each of the 2 parts of that habit goal? I've been doing some research using google and reddit but having a hard time avoiding information on the metric system which isn't relevant. Any suggestions, places to look or suggested reading would be extremely helpful.

My current thinking is to simplify by changing:

1. from Completion Goal to Target Weekly Frequency

2. from Target to Target Value

Although I think thats still too confusing. 

Any and all thoughts welcome, thank you. ",2,3

I'm currently working as an analyst, and I want to make sure I don't remain stagnant in my career, so I'm considering going back for my masters.   I'm considering programs like these:

[NJIT MS Applied Stats](http://math.njit.edu/academics/graduate/ms-appliedstatistics/)

[Penn State MS Applied Stats](http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/applied-statistics-masters/overview)

[NJIT MS Software Engineering](http://catalog.njit.edu/graduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/software-engineering-ms/)

I'm trying to figure out, which would set me up to further my career as an analyst, or in the data science field.  I'm leaning towards Applied Stats because I feel like most of these Analytics and Data Science degrees are cash grabs with very little in the way of meaningful coursework.  For example, UC Berkeley has a program with an Intro to Python course.  That one class hardly seems worth almost $7k.  I'm a little more confident about Georgia Tech's program because their Online Masters in CS has seemed pretty solid.

Does it make sense to go for the Applied Stats degree as a way of sort of ""futureproofing"" my degree so to speak?  Spending money to earn a degree learning things like Python, R, and Tableau seems like it could get dated pretty quickly, and those are things I teach myself for the most part.

The reason I'm looking at Applied Stats and not pure Stats is because I have an Econ undergrad degree and lack a lot of the undergrad coursework for a pure Statistics degree.  The admissions for an Applied Stats degree seem to be a little more lenient.  I also don't want to have to go back and take additional undergraduate courses, as my company won't pay for undergrad courses, but will pay for the Masters courses.

To give some insight about my previous experiences, I have a Bachelors in Computer Science, Masters in Evaluation and Statistics, and a Doctorate in Higher Education Administration. Before this position, I worked in institutional research for 2 years investigating student enrollment data via frozen files in Excel that I imported to SPSS to complete any analysis. Additionally, when working as a Research Associate in the Assessment office, I would use Informer queries on Elucian (Colleague), the school's relational database. I have also used Business Intelligence through SAP to obtain student data from a variety of universes to compile and analyze how personal characteristics impacts student outcomes. 

Is this likely the kind of data mining they are looking for, or is there specific skills I should brush up on before my interview on Monday? Thank you for your assistance!",2,1

I have always thought that at some point in life I would be able to run my own small/medium company and I was wondering if this would be a viable option as a data scientist.

The question may sound stupid (or it actually is, help me) but the reason why I am asking this is because I feel that as a medium experienced software developer it would be somehow _easy_ to ""just have the right idea"" and mock a prototype software/web app/mobile app to showcase to investors.

On the other side I see data science as a key department in medium/big companies but I find it difficult to think of a medium experienced data scientist starting off his company by, at least initially, leveraging only his own skills. I'd rather think of a senior data scientist running a company based on some cutting edge technology.

I hope this all makes sense. I'm just trying to balance my current desire to get into data science with what I think would be my _ultimate goal_ of running my own small company.

I hope this is of interest to some here. Please forgive some of the advertising language in what follows, as I'm paraphrasing a little from promotional materials.

A new collaborative venture between the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University in the UK has just got underway. The Liverpool Big Data Science (LIVDAT) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) is a hub for training students in managing, analysing and interpreting large, complex datasets (an/or high flow rate data) from the physical sciences.

The CDT promises a unique training approach addressing challenges in data intensive science to tackle a growing skills gap. It will provide training in Big Data science to a cohort of ~20 *fully funded* PhD students, starting October 2017, to create future leaders in data intensive science. The projects will address R&amp;D challenges in astronomy, nuclear, particle and accelerator physics and involve Monte Carlo studies, Deep Learning and HPC, as well as Data Analysis.

The new training centre is supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and will be hosted by the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University. It will offer a comprehensive training in data intensive science through cutting edge research projects and a targeted academic training programme, complemented by secondments to national and international partners.

More details can be found [here](http://www.livdat.org). My personal involvement is in the astrophysics side, which is hosted at Liverpool John Moores University. Details specific to those projects can be found [here](http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/newsitem-livdat). I'd be more than happy to chat with any interested parties via PM. The deadline for applications is June 1st 2017.",0,4

Using the scientific method, we are able to optimize on specific metrics using the latest tech and creativity.

When it comes to applying for jobs most throw away the scientific method and just do what they've been told: 

Write the typical resume, with the typical cover letter, apply online,  and then beg for a hiring manager to call them. 

&amp;nbsp;


What if we thought of getting a job as our next data challenge?

What if we first defined out target audience (ex: hiring managers in the health sector), packaged ourselves in order to achieve product market fit by getting constant feedback, found a metric that we want to maximize (ex: # of positive responses from hiring managers), and thought of novel ways to reach our audience.

If we applied the data science methods to our jobs we can uncover our eyes to the infinite options we have.

***

A friend asked me a question: The book has some many stories, which are the most relevant?
This made me wonder if this question has been approached with data-driven methods.

For scientific papers, there are citation impacts. 
There is a source, and the number of references to it.

Could a simular method be used to create a heatmap for the contents of religious books?

***

There is a central node, and secondary nodes. These are related to the central node if there is a citation. If so we have an edge.

In the case of academic papers, this is a straightforward problem.

The central node is static. 
Secondary sources are well defined. Citations (references) are supposed to be explicit &amp; formalized. 
So edges are known and determining them requires no additional calculation.

Religious books are different.

For one they often exist in multiple versions, the source is actually a set of nodes. Historically, this problem has been partially handled by using canons (numerical indexes), which could also help here. There are slight variations in the indexes, but mappings could be created with limited effort. The central node could be a union of indexed versions.

It would be impractical to sort trough all secondary sources.

A rough method could be to look at a large set of pages, and scan each one for an element from a group of keywords, plus an index format. Then check if there is a significant substring match in the page and the related element in central node. If so there is an edge.

Additional impact analysis could be performed by comparing the results from different choises of keywords, or more broadly speaking: categorising the references: sect, language, year, etc...

***

Do you know about existing research in this direction, if so, could you give me a pointer?

Does the approach described above seem sensible? If so, any suggestions which math to use in order to perform the text matching part somewhat efficiently? I'm considering trying this for a small test, say genesis versus wikipedia dump.",2,5

If I had a dataset on which I wanted to perform, lets say classification. I have around 100 features and would like to scale them down using feature selection. I also want to try out different algorithms (Boosted trees, Random Forest, SVM etc.) to see which one performs best on my data with parameter tuning. What is the best order to go about doing this. 

My thoughts were to take each algorithm separately and perform feature selection (using cross validation) and then using the resultant 'best features' tuning the parameters of the algorithm, again using cross validation. I would do this for each algorithm and see which comes out with the best accuracy..... 

Would there be another approach/order to this. Feature selection in some cases can be performed irrespective of the choice of algorithm so I suppose you could start with that and use the resultant features to then follow the above steps?

I guess a TLDR would be: Should feature selection/engineering be performed before algorithm selection/tuning or nested within the model for each algorithm?",11,5

6 weeks course for $625. The syllabus looks pretty in-depth, with basic statistics and 6+ months working knowledge of Python or R recommended. There's 17 case studies which don't count towards your grade, but are able to be solved in Python, R, or MATLAB. 

It almost seems like this might be a pretty good deal in terms of covering a wide range of topics and algorithms without going too deep into the math of a handful, and keeping you on-task with the materials with homework but not being incredibly time-consuming by forcing you to submit code weekly (given that most people taking this are probably working full-time).

2) what technologies do you use most often with clients. Are you doing a lot of SQL, working in hive or spark, still using CSV or excel? Working in r or Python for analyses?

Do you guys have any strong resources I can use throughout the course of next year to expand my knowledge in this field?

Quick question on taking a training model and then using it for prediction. 

Assume I have 2 data sets, the first is small and has the truly observed outcome. This data set is also unbalanced (N = 100, Targets = 25, Non-targets = 75). To identify best features, model parameters etc, I am using leave one out cross validation and a balanced cross validation data set approach. This can be summarized as follows: 

     1) Remove 1st observation and down-sample Non-targets to be equal with targets
     2) Train model 
     3) Make prediction on removed observation
     4) repeat steps 1 - 3 100 times to account for sampling variability 
     5) Aggregate prediction votes and classify observation as majority vote

After developing this model and identifying the proper feature, parameter settings etc. I want to apply this to a new data set and classify each observation as Target/Non-target. To do so should I 

A) 

    1) Train model using optimal features/settings on all training data 
    2) Make predictions on second data set using newly trained model

B) 

    1) Train model using optimal features/setting on balanced training set down-sampling Non-targets (same method as above)
    2) Make predictions on second data set
    3) repeat steps 1 and 2 100 times to account for the sampling variability 
    4) Final prediction is based upon the aggregate voting

Cross posted from /r/bioinformatics.

I'm currently at a crossroads in my life and would love your input/advice. I'm 25, bachelors in Biochemistry and minor in Statistics. 2 Years + experience as a bioinformatics programmer/analyst at a reputable university/hospital in nyc(proficient programmer in R, Python, and SQL). With a co-authored paper published and a couple on the way.
At this point I'm unsure whether it's a good use of my time to do a masters or a phD(although that paycut is a serious problem).  I definitely want to get out of academia and start working in industry as a data scientist(ASAP). However, my main concern is a glass ceiling without a masters/phD, do you think they are necessary?

For those of you working in the field, what would you do?

thanks for your input.

This is a brand new project, but I'm trying to make a tool that detects whether or not Tweets from a given geographical area have gang-related content and records the ones that do.

**Pros of Khan Academy:**

Starts from the very basics(Mean, median,mode etc.)

No cost for using it.

**Pros of Linkedin learning:**

I get a LinkedIn profile certificate on completion of their course.

I started off as a business analyst developing ms access databases and excel macros to automate some workflows as well as weekly/monthly reports. My next gig was a contract to implement standardized reporting processes for another company where I got to use tableau and more sql server.

My current job is at a Big 4 accounting firm that leverages analytics tools and technologies to help external auditors perform audits on client financial statements. We use different tools like tableau, qlikview, alteryx, sql server, and also some proprietary applications.

I basically act as a project manager and developer so I'm responsible for managing the timeline and budgets as well as doing the technical work or managing/coordinating with offshore developers to deliver the reports. I specialize in ad hoc requests where I have to work with business users to understand the requirements, get the data, do the data wrangling, and develop the visualizations. However most of the stuff I do is summarizations or relatively simple calculations. 

I'm currently making $75000 a year working in the Bay Area and I'm trying to find an entry level data analyst role where I can have the chance to do some data science-ey work and earn at least that much and hopfully more. I think I steady have pretty good programming and SQL experience. Is that possible or do I need to go back to school and get an advanced degree in something like statistics?",14,5

This allows me to effectively back-in to their time spent online, since they can't be served an ad when not online.  What I'm struggling with now is how best to use this information.  I could look at the average number of ads/day a user sees just to get a metric of average time online.  I could also create, for each user, a distribution of what time during the day they're online, for example.  Both of these seem quite reductionist for the wealth of information present.

One of the good things about the job though is Ive had the opportunity to learn and use R and SQL pretty regularly to handle the relatively large volumes of data we generate and search for trends or drifting processes, and Ive come to enjoy this aspect of the job much more than the rest of it. 

Because of this, Ive become interested in data science and have taken some Coursera courses, taught myself some python, read some of the recommended textbooks like Intro to statistical learning, etc. As a trial, Ive shot out a good 30 resumes or so to data science related jobs trying to highlight all the computational work that I have done, which is admittedly probably limited, but Ive received no replies. I suppose this isnt much of a surprise given my lack of background in the field. I wanted to figure out the right way to transition to the field as effectively as possible. Would it be worthwhile to do one of those online masters, like the Georgia tech MS in analytics, or is that overkill? What are the other best alternatives? Or is it just not worth it at this point, as Id be giving up some significant domain expertise?

My question revolves around how to enter the ""field"" of data science given a background in statistics and econometrics.

I took courses relating to mathematical probability as well as econometrics, so I think I am well-equipped on the statistics side.

I have done some research, and I know there are several options in general for those without a strictly CS background, namely MOOCs, boot camps, and higher education. Disregarding the higher education option for now, the two options require a basic understanding of what data science is and the general tools of the trade.

All the salespeople and business negotiators who know how to use rudimentary Excel pivot tables and SQL think that their 'loose definition' of big data allows them to smear this buzzword in every crevice of their conversation, proposal titles, and presentations just to sound smart in front of the uninformed. Big data is a misnomer tacked on to everything for it to seem more je ne sais quoi than what it actually is.

I mean, it's cool because they are educating themselves on the new trends but after a while, it gets so old and unimaginative...if it's a data frame with 1 million rows just be humble and call it a data frame already...if it's anything less and you can open the file on excel without it lagging for 2 minutes, the data is not big enough to qualify -- that's the rule of thumb.

If you are practicing the discipline among peers, you don't dare utter that term unless you want to be the laughing stock...the term 'data science' in the future will also fall into this category...just call things predictive analytics or bayesian machine learning or the precise term for what you are doing already. if it's a tuple, call it a tuple already..having something be called a 'data dump' is much more refreshing than it being called 'big data' -- on the condition that data dump is the accurate definition of what is depicted.

You gotta use more precise terms instead of a bloated conglomerate term that could mean everything and anything that could qualitatively be described as ""big"" and any 'thing' that could be broken down as ""data""...in the same vein, any hard discipline could be classified as a ""science,"" which would also make the term ""data science"" obsolete as well because a lot of disciplines are sciences and they generate data....

All these candy conferences with 'big data' in their title are there to introduce the topic to the layman or to the businessmen with investment money trying to upscale and sigma six their business. It's a double edged sword because machine learning, algorithms, and automation will lay off half their staff. The people whose jobs are in jeopardy would rather turn away from the technology and do busy-work for the rest of their lives instead of retraining for industry

I have a pet peeve with corporations refusing/neglecting to implement some of this machine learning, algorithms, and automation correctly to their business model while adapting to the times...programming needs to be taught in school and treated as importantly as studying a foreign language. MBAs need coding classes to get their feet wet into the business world of tomorrow..data analytics is a start

...I also have a pet peeve with too many companies trying to save money by hiring no-name consulting companies-who-claim-what-they-know-what-they-are-doing but fall sub par with industrial standards to the point that the progress never develops and these money-conscious companies subsequently shy away from hiring true talent or established companies that could upgrade them properly because they are afraid to put value and invest in the future.

Some conservative companies actively try to suppress this technology due to their ""higher morals"" when the money that the company can save can pay off their severance packages...not to mention that you and I are both wasting our adult lives at work doing the mindless tasks that could be automated..it's hard to let go but do you want to be a pencil pusher for the rest of your career? time is money and we're wasting both. Time to retrain for industry and do something worthwhile that has greater impact and brings higher sense of self; something that you always wanted to do while sustaining your bottom line...because after all, life is too short",6,3

I'm 25 years old.  Graduated 2.5 years ago with a BBA in Management Information systems from a US school with a top 10 ranking in that degree.  So in college i took:

- Intro to Programming (java)

- Intro to Data Management (SQL)

- Web Application Development (capstone course - developed web apps using java/sql,html,css)

- Energy Informatics (R)

I also took Statistics and Calculus courses early in my career and aced those courses.  Finished with a 3.14 GPA and a 3.54 GPA within my MIS classes.

(note - even though i took these classes in college, it's been two years and my skills aren't that great anymore.  I have that background though and i'm confident in my ability to pick it back up again.

After graduating i took a job as a business analyst and i'm really dissatisfied with my job.  I do a lot of work in excel, I set up and basically run my company's whole salesforce reporting, I use SQL minimally, and I try to use R just because i want to improve my skills, but i rarely have any need to use it.  My pay is well below average for my degree, and I don't see my career going anywhere at the company I'm at.  

All along I've wanted to get into a career in more advanced analytics, and I want to develop my skills in R/enterprise tools for data visualization.  For whatever reason i wasn't able to get the jobs i wanted after college and i've had no luck interviewing since then.

At this point i don't know where to go.  I'm extremely passionate about data/statistics/analytics/etc. but i don't know how to develop those skills further or get into a profession that can help me develop those skills.  Meanwhile I'm pretty envious of all my friends from college getting great jobs consulting at big-4 firms and making significantly more money than me.

I'm wondering if anyone has been where I am and has some advice on how I can get where I want to.. I can't see the pathway.  

Are there particular jobs that I should be looking for (in the area of data/analytics/informatics/etc.) that would accept someone of my skills?  Should I look into grad school? Do i have the prerequisites for an MS or MBA in Data Analytics?  Is this even the correct subreddit to ask these questions?

I just feel like i need someone's help so that i can take the necessary steps.  

Thank you!

First time posting here 

Here's the link to my resume:

Would anyone be kind enough to review my resume and provide some feedback?

Id really appreciate any feedback that you can provide, particularly if youre working in the data science field or are used to looking at DS resumes.

I am hoping to land a data science role where I can develop my skills in Machine Learning, ideally in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Examples of the kind of DS opportunities that I want to target:

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/270954646/

Im Canadian but have family in Texas, and looking for roles anywhere in US, but ideally California or Seattle area. 

Im currently finishing up my Masters in Big Data in UK, graduating in July 2017. Ive listed the highlights of my coursework and projects that Ive worked on, just to give you an idea of the DS fundamentals that I know. 

I crafted my resume based on the skills and experience that I would have gained by the end of my masters, as my prior experience is in design engineering and consulting and nothing related to data science. However, I may not be presenting my skills/experience in the way that I should.

Two KEY questions that I'm trying to figure out:
1. Is this resume tailored towards a starting DS/ML position.
2. If you saw this resume, would you setup a follow-up call ?

Any other qualitative feedback is greatly appreciated!!

Thank you so much for your time and help in reviewing my profile.

A few notes regarding my resume based on the feedback that I've read on this subreddit:
*      I put education first since I'm currently studying and will be applying for jobs as a graduate student.
*      I am not able to weave the technical tools (Python, R etc) that I've listed into the achievements at each of my jobs, because I did not use any of them at my previous jobs. The only thing relevant I used was Excel.
*      I combined the job's responsibilities with my achievements instead of separating them, because I was trying to be brief and concise and was trying to focus more on achievements. 
*      I am hoping that the ""Projects"" section under my Master's is sufficiently framing my activities to data science, particularly because my prior professional experience is not DS related.

Edit:
Sorry, I should have made it clear, I changed any identifying information including the name of the companies, my contact info, email addresses for anonymity purposes. 

Obviously, if I was a founder of fitbit then I wouldn't be looking for a job right now. I thought that it would be obvious that fitbit was a placeholder name for my startup, and also because I used my reddit ID for my email and github account on my resume. But I guess I was wrong. My bad...

But I'm not lying on my resume. All the underlying information is correct and can be backed up, EXCEPT that the version you guys are seeing have placeholder company names and contact info. Also, my name is not David Hutchinson but I guess it's a bit better than having another 'John Doe' on a resume

I'm trying to come up with a plan to nudge our organization in a more sophisticated direction when it comes to the analysis we do internally and for our clients. As the insurance industry is behind the technology curve in 95% of cases, I believe there's a big opportunity to make a splash with data offerings. There's definitely more that we can do with the tools we have (i.e. the big players in BI, more or less), and I have that on lock.

What I'm uncertain about is whether a data science platform would even work for our organization. If you don't know anything about brokerages, know this: most of us don't have many clients, and the information about the clients we have doesn't change very often. We're a fairly large brokerage and we still don't have 10,000 clients. What I'm trying to get at is that we're not GEICO with everyone and their dog having an auto policy and a homeowners policy and maybe a motorcycle policy and maybe little Jimmy is going off to college as well so he needs renters insurance and so on. Even for our largest clients, the information we have is scant and changes at a snail's pace.

I have the following available to me:

- Client demographics, but mostly limited to where you're located, what industry you're in, how long you've been in business.

- Coverage information. We have all the policies we broker for them on record, but we don't necessarily have all the important details about those policies in a place we can query.

- Transactions. As a broker, premium dollars flow in to us and out to our carrier partners. Our revenue is a commission on that premium, and our sales staff gets a cut of that commission.

Unfortunately, that's about it at this time. Here's what I know I need:

- More client demographics, especially financial performance and cultural observations (e.g. what's your risk tolerance? how do you approach safety in the workplace? etc.)

- More about the clients we don't have. What's the market like out there where our sales staff hasn't had any opportunities? How much do we already control of the markets our clients are in?

- More about the coverage in the policies we broker. I need every data point, full stop, but the data points that I need the most are those that carriers use to calculate their rates.

If you're still reading, thank you. Maybe I'm answering my own question here, but do we need to get all these data gaps filled before thinking about uttering the phrases ""machine learning"" or ""Bayesian inference"" or anything like that? If not, what can we do with our current, low-frequency data? What am I missing?",8,17

__________________

(using a movie dataset with several tables) - We'd like you to tell us which genres are most clear-cut and which are so muddled that they tend to be listed among several others for a typical movie.

In other words, let us know- for each genre in the dataset- how many genres the movies in that genre are in, on average. For example, if an average Horror movie is in 1.3 genres and average Adventure movie is in 2.9 genres then we would say Horror is a better-defined genre than Adventure.

To polish up your answer, please provide both the average and maximum number of genres for movies in each genre but sort the list in descending order by average genre count.

I really want to to go to grad school for stats or data science. But maybe work for a year or two before I start grad school. I'd like for the work I do after my undergrad to be data science-y. 

For this summer I have a 'data analytics' internship at a small marketing agency which means nothing honestly. They use a marketing automation platform for 1 or 2 of their clients but there's no CRM integration so there's barely any data. I helped them get data from their software API but other than that I spend my day doing inane tasks like making plots of Google analytics data and exporting data to excel and writing a report about what it means. It doesn't feel like I'm doing any real analytics. 

In the meantime I've completed a series of MOOCs on Python and did a few small projects and feel good about my basic understanding of Python. Right now I'm doing the 10 course Data science specialization in R by John's Hopkins. 

As soon as it's done, I'm gonna finish reading 'Hands on machine learning with sci kit learn and tensor flow' and then I want to take some MOOCs on databases and THEN start building a portfolio. 

Does this seem like an okay path? My stats background is decent. Because of how courses are structured at my college, I can't take time series but I will be taking stochastic models and mathematical stats and a course in probability and stats for data science. 

What am I missing? What should I add/improve. Should I take the Stanford machine learning course? Read ISL/ESL?

I think im applying PCA wrong. 

I have a time series financial data that has time, price, and bunch of factors that affect that theorteically the price, such as inflation, interest rate, unemployment, etc.

I'm using PCA to find out which components have 0 eigenvalues (i.e. ignorable) with respect to price so I can ignore them in my future code (in case anyone is wondering, beta factor modeling).

Here's the code I am using

        
    	df = collect_df() # basically compiles many pickles into one giant DF, indexed by time... minus PRICE. Nothing fancy
        df.dropna(inplace=True)
    
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        df_std = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df)
    
        pca = PCA()
        pca.fit(df_std)
    
        variance_ratios = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
        factors_and_pca = dict(zip(df.columns, variance_ratios ))
        pprint(factors_and_pca)
    
    
        plt.bar(range(len(factors_and_pca)), factors_and_pca.values(), align='center')
        plt.xticks(range(len(factors_and_pca)), factors_and_pca.keys())
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show() 

Here are couple of problems and questions

1) I noticeed that the 1st column almost always has the highest variance ratio. If I remove this col (col 1) via (del(df[""col1""])), the next column (i.e. col2) becomes the highest variance ratio column. 

Here's the original graph: https://s2.postimg.org/uzfaj0xjt/plotted-1.png

After I remove the first column (quandl-FRED-BASE), i get https://s2.postimg.org/vdgmimhnd/plotted-2.png

In other words, every time I shift the array over one, the graph always says that the 1st column has the highest variance ratio (which naturally sounds wrong)

Am I misunderstood? Is this not how PCA is used? 

2) I am still confused - how can PCA figure out variance ratio w/respect to the price if the price column is NOT passed into PCA?  I've been following this guideline (http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html) that uses Iris data packaged with scikit learn.

For example - perhaps when a customer first interacts with the website they buy product X approximately once every month or so, but after a few months the frequency changes, or perhaps they also start to buy product Y.  Perhaps in the dataset there are also users who start buying product Y frequently, before they stop purchasing Y altogether and begin buying product Z. I don't know the list of behaviors ahead of time, and would want to learn that (as well as shifts between them) if possible.

466,2017-5-30,2017,5,30,5,6e2iik,To get or not to get a Master's?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6e2iik/to_get_or_not_to_get_a_masters/,MisterMxyzptlk1844,1496088130,"I apologize for being the umpteenth person to ask this, I just want to get an answer that is tailored to my situation as much as possible (which probably won't much different than others in the end, but still...)

Anyway, regarding my background: I am currently an Insurance Analyst who graduated as an Actuarial Science major, so I have some statistical background (having also taken Calculus of course, as well as Linear Algebra). I have also used R before for a project and am planning to use this program again (or perhaps some other similar analytical program) to show my manager something relevant from it. And of course, I'm Excel and Access savvy as well (being in charge of updating the insurance database with the latter). For the record, I was indeed intending to go actuarial, but for reasons too long to explain, I've been drawn more and more to this field in recent months. 

So having said all that, would landing in a Data Analyst or Junior Data Scientist position and staying in it for 3 or so years (on top of learning new programming, techniques, etc.) be sufficient (or not) to transfer into the full-fledged Data Scientist position? Or do I absolutely need a Master's for this? I don't mind going this route if need be, the only problem though is the debt I'd incur, which is something I'd of course have to plan around...

Follow up question, if I don't need a Master's, are there any certifications of sorts I should (or perhaps have to) earn?

Ideally I'd like to be able to take some stored data, run certain statistical methods/algorithms/processing over it, and then serve it up to users in a nice looking web app.

I've done a little scripting in everything, and my SQL is quite good, but basically know very little about accomplishing the rest.

What would be a good method of doing this for a small volume of data/no. of users? Medium? Large? What about for more processing-intensive analytics?

For something basic I'm thinking you have a cronjob script (Python, etc) on your database running every 15 minutes or so which pulls out the data from the relevant database, does the necessary calculations, then maybe feeds the data back into another table on the database. End users accessing the dashboard on your web app then pull these analysed values (don't really know anything about how this is done).

What would a good system look like? How does it change when you start scaling? I feel like I've learned a bunch of things (NoSQL dbs, different scripting languages, etc) with no understanding of how to piece them all together.
