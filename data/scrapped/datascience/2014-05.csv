I have a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from UC Davis. My initial plan was to go to medical school (I scored a 37 in my MCAT, for what its worth), but I've come to realize this isn't a lifestyle I want to pursue.

I've always been teaching myself other skills outside of my realm of expertise, but I still do not know how feasible it is for me to pursue data science as a career. It may take years, but I'm willing to invest the time and effort to pursue this.

What skills should I focus on at this stage? I know python and java, but of course have no professional experience as a software developer (yet). I also did not have to take linear algebra or differential equations. Is it practical to teach myself the math or should I enroll in a traditional course?

Has anyone here made the transition from a biology-related field to data science? Or even data analysis, statistics, or any other quant-heavy field? How did you make the transition?

Any guidance and feedback will be greatly appreciated. I am in desperate need of a mentor. My family is encouraging me to apply to the Berkeley MIDS program, but I have a ton of prerequisites to fill before I become well placed as a candidate.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Hope it's ok I'm asking this here. I've been considering starting up a business in data science. I have a lot of questions though, and was wondering if you guys would be willing to answer some of them. I realize that these things vary widely, but that's ok with some context. You don't need to answer all of these.

So...

If you had an ideal team, how many people would be on it?

What is the fewest number of people who can work on a team? (Not aiming for this, more curious about role division and solo-ability)

What kinds of tools do you guys use?

How powerful would my computers need to be?

How big is the data (gigs, teras)?

How long does it usually take to complete a project?

How long does it take someone to attain a meaningful level of mastery?

Anything you wish you had for work now?

Anything else?


If you are wondering something along the lines of ""wtf, this guy doesn't know anything how does he expect to make this work?!"" I'm right there with you. My initial goal will likely be to build a team and empower them. The reason I want to do it is that I see a pretty big opportunity in a field that I absolutely love. Thanks!",16,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm familiar with Stata and know HTML and some basic Python. I mine and work with (i.e. correlations, regressions, etc.) small to medium sized datasets. I'd previously assumed working with big data would just be a jump up to larger datasets, but it seems like I'd need a healthy dose of programming knowledge to even get started. So, given my background, what skills should I look to acquire, in order of necessity? Thanks in advance, guys.",17,4,False,self,,,,,
