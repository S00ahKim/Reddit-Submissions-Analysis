I'm a reporter trying to integrate data analysis into my reporting on local issues. I like to give myself little challenges over the weekend to test my skills. This weekend, I thought I'd map out households that have claimed some kind of government assistance (Table B19057: Public Assistance Income for Households) in the county I live in. It was pretty neat, but I thought I should find some other table to help put things in perspective.   
I downloaded another table of household income quintile upper limits (Table b19080) and I realized as I was looking through it I really wasn't sure what the table was showing.  I tried looking for some information on the census website, and then a few others, but I had a difficult time finding something that said ""This is what this table is and what it means.""   
At first I thought looking at the lowest quintile group meant I was looking at the average income levels for households making the least amount of money. I'm not really sure if that's the case though.

This made me realize that, while I could infer the meaning of the data in the assistance table, I was still really just assuming what it was.   
Is there any particular source anyone could recommend that explains what these tables are, what information you can infer from them, and maybe even examples of how not to use certain data?

I'm trying to develop a forecasting model, and running into an issue that I can't seem to find a solution for.

I think the heart of my question is: When my labels do not represent an optimal state. How can I develop a forecasting model that *does* represent 'optimal'.

Here's my example problem:

You're trying to determine the headcount for a grocery store's cash registers. You have historical data of what our headcount was and how many customers we had in line. However, what happens when we also identify that there was a bottleneck at some point?  Maybe poor management led to under-staffing in the past, or we just had a lot of turnover that led to lower headcount than needed. This sets our headcount numbers, for an extended period of time, as lower than needed, but we don't *know* what was actually needed.

I hope I clearly got the point across in my question/example, but let me know if there needs to be some clarification.

I am proficient in Python to a fairly advanced degree, and I have done two online courses and a few small paid projects in the data science space. I am fairly confident in my python and DS abilities, if not with actual skills then with my ability to learn quickly.

I have been speaking to a new app start-up (very early days) and they told me that they want me to be involved in their data/analytics. It is in the physiology space and seemed at first to suit me quite nicely. They told me about some of the examples of areas where they need DS expertise and they looked very interesting (clinical language NLP, analytics of physiology data to develop fitness models, etc). All this seems awesome and stuff that I can do.

However, I just had a meeting with them and they said they were very impressed with me and that they would soon be making me an offer to handle all of the backend development. 

My concern is that a much of this seems to involve app development, with only a part being data-science oriented. E.g. they want me to set up Google Firebase and other cloud services, which is something I have no experience with. They understand this and they're happy for me to learn on the job.

I'd like to break into the DS world. I will learn about app development if necessary, but I'm cautious of it becoming a distraction to my career path. I've also never worked as a data scientist, so I'm not sure how much of this is just an accepted part of the job?

So my questions to you: 

* How much of what you do as a data scientist is in the non-DS world? Is it expected that data scientists also do developer work?

* Would future employers consider backend development to be a useful skill? Or will I end up wasting my time learning skills that I'll never use as a full-fledged data scientist?

* I suspect that they will ask me to work for equity, which I am not opposed to, but I have no idea what are the relevant questions to ask here. I assume it will involve seeing research about projected revenue and over what timeline. But any other advice here will be appreciated?

Basically, I'm looking to conduct an analysis on the effects of ""X"" on sales over a period of time. The issue here is that the data is non-stationary, so I would need to control for seasonality and trend, in order to isolate ""X"". Furthermore, ""X"" has only been in effect for the past 30 days, but the entire data set is comprised of 3 years of transaction data at the daily level (approx 1095 observations). 

The following is the process that I'm considering, and please feel free to criticize with as much ferociousness as you deem fit

**Model**

* I plan to model this using a multiple linear regression with Sales$ as the dependent variable

**Features**:

*-Treatment group (dummy coded as 1 and 0)*

* Group 1: ""Days with 'X' "" (1)
* Group 2: ""Days without 'X'"" (0)
* Given that group 2 has a far larger sample, my plan is to limited this group to only a subset of the data--the immediate 30 days prior to the treatment going into effect. 

*-Seasonality/Trend*

* I plan to extract seasonality and trend using the python library statsmodels-decompose and and add them as variables in the model in order to isolate the unique contribution of ""X"" on sales, while controlling for effects cause by seasonality and trend.
* Both would not be dummy coded (please advise if this is the wrong approach)

*Day of Week*

* Additionally, I plan on including day of week as a dummy coded variable as well 

*Evaluation*

* I would evaluate using the beta coefficient for the treatment group to determine the difference in sales while controlling for all other features in the model and assess whether or not p value is less than .05. 

Would you consider this a valid approach? If not, what would you suggest?",6,2
52,2018-7-3,2018,7,3,12,8vp2cp,Question about breaking into data science later in career,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8vp2cp/question_about_breaking_into_data_science_later/,chiurona,1530589507,"Hi there -- wondering if people have perspective on when is ""too late"" in a career to break into data science? 

For some context, I have software engineers and EEs in my extended family who came up in the 80s learning stuff like FORTRAN and COBOL. My impression is that they have really fought tooth and nail to retain their jobs as they edge towards retirement. I don't have the full story because it is kind of awkward to ask, but that's something that has always made me a bit anxious about ""high tech"" (of course I know that's not synonymous with data science but this is for the purpose of discussion). 

I'm in my late twenties and I have experience in data acquisition/operations but I would love to take on more data science work that would involve Python and R that isn't necessarily in my day to day. I use a little SQL, but not a lot. I'm learning slowly in my free time and I know plenty of mid-career people who recently broke into data science through many different kinds of pathways. Thing about those people though, is that almost everyone I know in that position had some kind of STEM background in common that I don't have at all. So, I feel like I do have to market myself in a different way and would potentially have more ground to cover to break into the field (not a lot of personal/work experience in ETL, experiment design, statistics yet).

I know that getting started in my late twenties is definitely not late relative to how long most careers even last, but I want to be grounded and realistic about my next steps if I want to follow this interest. Like I said, my reference point is software engineering where I feel like getting a first software engineering job north of 30 is definitely not impossible, but I understand that is more challenging given that there is age bias towards recent college grads. Maybe I have really been fed a lot of Silicon Valley coder stereotypes (and I might be imaging more overlap than there really is between data science/software) and that colors my perceptions, but I'm wondering if there is overlap between that culture and data science. 

Appreciate any insights or experiences here!

I'd like to say I have an interest in preparing spreadsheets and building tables etc etc off Excel. As such, lead me to having an interest in business/data analyst where I hope to learn and acquire skills in business information systems to help businesses make better decisions. This further led me to undertake a master degree in BIS, where I wanted to learn and develop skills that will effectively prepare my to be a data analyst where I can utilise my skills in data analysing and providing advice for businesses to make better decisions (I have just finished one semester of this degree). On top of this, I am very interested in automation and one day, I'd like to build scripts that will help in some way reduce tasks that can be autonomous/mundane and improve productivity &amp; efficiency.

At the moment, I have been approached with the task of full-time implementing an ERP with CRM module inbuilt which will roughly take minimum of 2 years to implement, from warehousing, inventory, payroll, and etc etc. With this in mind, once the system has been fully implemented, I believe there are plenty of opportunities for me to analyse their data and have an input in making better decisions for the business. This being the case, I will need to put my masters on hold and dedicated full-time to this position. I am already planning to accept this offer, however, I am concerned about the skills required to do a great job at this. So my question is:

How good do you have to be at coding? How good do you have to be at math to succeed? These are the most important questions because Id say Im above average in University at both, but Im by no means top of the class, would you recommend I dont pursue an Analytics/AI masters/job then?

Thanks to everyone who replies I really need advice on this!",4,2

They don't offer a data analysis degree. The pros to doing this course vs one at another school is that it's 99% online (final capstone project needs to be presented on campus), and because I'm a veteran, I get a pretty significant reduction in the cost (I believe they cover 50% of fees and the way this course is set up, it's all considered fees). I still have to make sure on that piece as the last time I emailed the VA office at the school they were less than helpful. 

Basically I want to know if I'd be at a disadvantage for doing a program like this vs paying more for a degree in analytics, which is really what I want to do. I want to do more than just scrub data, I want to infer information from it. 

Any info is very helpful, thanks! ",0,1

We have recently released a new framework for distributed data processing - [Rain](https://github.com/substantic/rain). The ultimate goal of Rain is to simplify end-to-end data processing in distributed environments. Rain allows you to define large end-to-end data processing pipelines with complex inter-task dependencies (beyond standard map-reduce pattern). The pipelines can consist of various tasks ranging from external applications, through Python code, to C++/Rust code (and also offers easy extensibility). Rain features a simple Python API through which the pipelines are defined and executed.

Rain is an open source project we mostly do as a hobby, but it grew out of frustration with the existing tools being unsuitable to fit our work needs. We believe we are not alone and we would really like to hear who else might be interested - we want YOU to become Rain user! Currently, there are so many directions and potential features that we really need other people to help us to prioritize new features.

Looking forward to your comments!
Vojta, Tom, Standa, and Kuba from the Rain team

Very early on, like in the first two weeks of light searching, I got a Data Analyst offer at a company I've interned with previously, in a city I wanted to move out of, so I turned them down since I was really hoping to go elsewhere, and maybe find a more data science-y job (rather than just doing SQL in a more BI position). They also gave me minimal, minimal time to decide.

It's been a month and I've realized I made a HUGE HUGE HUGE mistake in turning it down. Entry level jobs in data science are impossible to find. Entry level jobs as a data analyst are also almost impossible to find. Or at least that's my experience.

I spent the masters program working mostly in R. I learned SQL in the past month to a beginner/intermediate level. I know Python from undergrad in a ""how to interview for a software engineering position"" perspective, though I've lost quite a bit of it and am now trying to learn pandas, sklearn, etc.

Looking at the other posts on this site and from the things I've read elsewhere online, I know  I'm definitely not a top applicant. I don't know Hadoop or AWS or Spark, I've never done Kaggle, I don't have research, I'm not a statistics or machine learning genius, etc. Of course I'd love to spend the time to learn that, but I'm running really low on time.

Since then, I finished a Data Science Bootcamp in September 2017 to build my technical skills and worked some freelance jobs as an analyst/developer for 6 months for arts related organizations.

I have been getting some responses, but I am just not doing well on the SQL tests/analytical assessments (I had no problems with these assessments back when I was applying for jobs in New York. The ones in Berlin seem much harder), and I can't get past the tests to get to the interview.

I am very interested in sports analytics so that would be my goal as far as career goes. Whether that is directly for a team or a firm the provides statistical analysis for teams and broadcast networks. Just think that the industry would keep me most excited and engaged.

I applied for the Analytics program at Georgia Tech but was denied. I have heard that these Analytics programs don't hold a ton of weight in the job market. Is this correct?

Currently working as an accountant at a fortune 500. Have an undergrad in Economics.

Applied Stats is all online, about ~20k. 
MIS with focus in Analytics would be in person and ~12k (in-state tuition).

I do not have any programming experience so my first goal would be to get a base of SQL and Python. 

I do think I want to get a Masters compared to self learning as I like the curriculum and would make it easier to switch fields since I am not getting any direct experience that would benefit me at my current job.

To my (admittedly naive) eyes that leaves me with two major careers paths: helping companies get people to click things on the internet, or helping the government 'fight terrorism'.  
  Since I'm not particularly interested in either of those paths, I was wondering what other career paths are out there.

My co-worker and I are building a multiple regression model to predict rent. Our Y input range  is the current rent of all our homes and our X range is beds, bath, sq feet, median income per zip code (2010 census), population density per square mile in a given zip code, total population per zip code, and cost per square foot given the current rent. To account for seasonality we have weighted averages for each season, Summer weighed 1.025, Winter .975, Fall .9875, Spring 1.0125 and then we create a range for any given property. 

However, I noticed an issue last night in terms of x input range. Should I even include cost per square foot if I am trying to predict rent? I previously did not do so because we are trying to predict the rent. However, when we attempted to run the regression without cost per square foot our rent estimates they were off by a few hundred dollars when we checked them out to the current rent we have on them. We were testing the model to what rent we already have on the homes. But when we included cost per square foot in the next regression test the rent estimates came out much more accurate than before. 

Im sure someone may mention you may want to include school ratings and crime, but I was unable to locate a spreadsheet that had a crime index matched with zip code and the same goes for average school ratings in a zip code.

Coming right to the point, Deep Learning is the most advanced and still mostly uncharted form of Machine Learning that many are apprehensive of applying, owing to the simple non-availability of, wait for it **Compute Power**.

Consider the non-availability or compute-demand that is hard to meet, of GPU resources to train a model, or a very huge requirement that requires abundant compute resources to train the models. This calls for innovative methods to perform DL training. Traditional methods involve Data and Model Parallelism, which partially quenches that demand, with distributed systems. *Raven takes both Data and Model Parallelisation approaches to form a different model of distribution.*",0,1

Some customers buy your product once, some twice, others fifty times. They can buy different types of your product, but ultimately were counting counting how often they buy any product. Your hypothesis is that certain types of products being bought is predictive of how many times someone buys. How would you best incorporate the type of item someone bought without leaking information as to how many times they bought any of your products?

It makes sense to be that, if a customer buys any of your products twice, but its the same product both times, that you could include the fact they bought product X as a one-hot indicator. This wouldnt be a 2: 2 mapping, which is cheating. My concern is with customers who buy twice, but buy different products. I think it would be easy for a model to learn that, in a world with product cardinality of two, their buying product X and Y at least once is predictive of their having purchased twice.

I wonder if the better route to go, given a history of visits to your store, some rows indicating the lack of any purchase, others indicating a purchase, would be to roll-up previous purchses for each product type prior to each visit and predict the likelihood, on the customers next visit (who knows when that could be), that they purchase again.

* If my model gets put into production and is later seen to do terribly, I just say how the real-world situation has changed where the model hadn't accounted for and get a free pass.  This process repeats indefinitely.  If the model even halfway works, I'm heralded as Jesus.
* The ubiquitous archaic, wacky database schemas have more nuance than substance, which usually kills any sort of scalable or transplantable model.  This makes it easy to blame the data and not the algorithm when things go wrong even though in reality no data set will actually ever be perfect.
* My best performing 'algorithms' weren't even ML and really were just creating some numeric thresholds to flag anomalies using basic means/medians/SD's. They were usually the most successful because they were the easiest to explain -- but you don't need a 'data scientist' to do this, lol.
* Data science meetings with non-technical people usually go nowhere because people don't want to get technical or ""get into the weeds"" which makes it incredibly difficult to talk about pros, cons, and limitations on what you can actually do.  So these meetings are usually complete wastes of time for the sake of appearing 'on top' of things.  This means I could even go to a non-technical meeting and not know a damn thing about anything and still appear competent so long as I sprinkle some DS lingo in my sentences every once in a while -- if I even talk at all.
* Data science meetings with technical people are usually composed of passive aggressive call-outs on why X algorithm doesn't make sense for problem Y even though in reality there's not any algorithm that will work perfectly.  The other possibility is simply hearing crickets in these meetings since most data scientists suffer imposter syndrome which means no one feels qualified to offer anything out loud, which creates silence  Both these types of meetings usually lead to people working 'independently together' on projects where they just hack their own code together and compare results/techniques later because people feel like the other people are just super dumb or because someone is too shy to propose something without trying it out first.  This means lots of duplicated (and probably fruitless) effort.
* Personal performance reviews rarely talk about how successful/unsuccessful a model was, but rather how much you communicated to others \[that the project you're making is the titanic in the making.\] because, well, your clients or non-technical manager don't want to look dumb by saying your stuff didn't work when they have no idea if it actually did or not.
* I've seen maybe 1 data scientist get fired and it wasn't even performance related -- the DS was just kind of too quirky and creeped out management. Most data scientists just leave at the first sign of being bored or not heard.

So, to recap:  In my experience, data scientists make models (...*that may not actually be models...*) that might not actually work, but because there are so many things that can go wrong data scientists are rarely ever held accountable if a model is garbage.  We also get paid a lot and, if we so much as get questioned about our usefulness, we can just jump ship to the next company desperate for DS talent and restart the process.  Does this not sound like the best job ever?",20,24

I was under the impression that most linear regression methods use an algorithm like Gradient Descent in order to find the optimal solution, and had to use iteration to get there.  


Some questions: 

1. Is it possible to deterministically find the slope and intercept of a linear regression given 2+ x features by simply minimizing the squared error across all dimensions? Specifically, I am looking for a proof that takes us through the entire optimization process, e.g. Khan Academy.   

2. According to [Andrew Ng via his Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on ML, there also exist forms of linear algebra that offer deterministic solutions to this. What are they? Where can I learn more about them?  

3. According to Ng, we use Gradient Descent, instead of a deterministic approach, because it is ""more efficient"" when training on larger data sets. I would like to understand this better. Can anyone point me to some benchmarking or more specific comparisons between these methods?  

4. The  [SciKit Learn Linear Regression model](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) uses Ordinary Least Squares by default, not Gradient Descent. Why? Which method do you use when training a LR model? Why? Where can I go to learn more about the math behind Ordinary Least Squares? Looking for something in-depth, e.g. Khan Academy.

My first post!   (I know, crazy, right?)

\------

# Specifically:

Does anyone have any particular knowledge / feedback / useful information about the University of Missouri's M.S. Data Science and Analytics program?  ([https://dsa.missouri.edu/](https://dsa.missouri.edu/))   They graduate their first class this spring, and I have had a hell of a time (read: zero luck) finding any information (objective or otherwise) about their program.

I have been planning on applying for Spring admissions but this program only begins in Fall so it's more-or-less trying to figure out do I go with this or wait and see if I can get in somewhere else...

\------

# Generally:

I know this question has been asked a whole bunch around here (so feel free to ignore), but I figured I'd see if there are any programs out there that I haven't considered.

Me: 31 years old.  Active duty military (Army first, now NOAA).  Finished my B.S. in Physics and Math in 2014.  Pretty tired of operations and becoming increasingly fearful of playing the paper pushing game as I move up the officer ranks.  I started relearning python and really digging back into Linux (used to be a super nerd back in the day).  I work in remote sensing and will be finishing up a space operations cert from Naval Post Grad school in the next year.  Goal:  Recall all of that math I learned, get damn good at coding (because it's fun) and see if I can't break into machine learning for spatial applications.

I have been eyeing and intend on applying to:  Georgia Tech OMSA, University of Wisconsin, UC Riverside.

Any general recommendation anyone would want to throw my way?

I'm currently considering taking up a distance learning program from the university of London in something more quantitative, given that my undergrad is in business. Thereafter I hope to apply to a graduate program in data science. There seems to be 2 obvious choices  currently:

Graduate Diploma in Data science: https://london.ac.uk/data-science
Graduate Diploma in Mathematics: https://london.ac.uk/courses/mathematics

These are the courses that I intend to take for each diploma:
1. Data Science: 
Information systems management (Compulsory)
Machine Learning (Compulsory)
Advanced statistics: Distribution theory [Half unit]
Advanced statistics: Inference [Half unit]
Econometrics
Total: 4 units

2. Mathematics:
Abstract Math (Compulsory)
Further linear algebra [Half unit] (Compulsory)
Further calculus [Half unit] (Compulsory)
Advanced statistics: Distribution theory [Half unit]
Advanced statistics: Inference [Half unit]
Game theory [Half unit] / Advanced mathematical analysis (Real analysis) [Half unit] &amp; Optimization theory [Half unit] OR Discrete Mathematics
Total: 4 units

My chief concern is the module 'Information systems management', which I'd really rather not take, since I had taken a similar module in my undergrad. It is also quite qualitative (which defeats the purpose of me taking this diploma in the first place). I had asked if it was possible to get an exemption but they said it was not possible.

Ironically, I felt that I would be better prepared for a career in data science if I took the diploma in Mathematics instead. I wouldn't be able to take up Machine Learning and Econometrics, but I thought that the math courses should more than make up for it. Besides, I should be able to look for resources online to learn machine learning. (Currently looking at MITx's Micromasters in Statistics and Data Science)

Also, if I were to take the diploma in Mathematics, should I take discrete mathematics or optimizations theory coupled with either game theory or advanced mathematical analysis (Real analysis)? Which would be better for a career in data science? I felt that both discrete math and optimization theory are both very important but unfortunately I'll have to sacrifice either one of them in favour of advanced statistics.
In other words, I have to choose between:
Discrete math VS optimization &amp; advanced mathematical analysis (Real analysis) VS optimization &amp; game theory

TLDR: 
1) Should I focus more on the name of the diploma 'Data Science' or the more quantitative 'Mathematics' to better set myself up for a career in data science?
2) Should I take up discrete mathematics or optimization theory? If I were to take up optimization theory, should I take it with advanced mathematical analysis (Real analysis) or game theory?

I would be very grateful for any advice or assistance! :D",2,2

I recently got accepted into the M.Eng program at the University of Toronto. I applied to this program, as they have a ""Emphasis in Analytics"" stream.

Does this program seem like a cash grab, or can it possibly help in finding me a job as a data scientist, or even a data analysts? 

Also I am currently working as a manufacturing engineer (did my undergrad in mechanical engineering from UofT), so I am planning to do this masters degree part-time, which will take me approximately 2.5 years to complete. I was thinking of quitting my job and doing this full time in a year, but I don't know if it is worth taking that risk. Not really happy with my job, but it is paying the bills.

--:|--:|--:|

50|0|1|

Where `gender` has two discrete values that have been one-hot encoded, ""male"" and ""female.""

Suppose I have an ML model I built, and I want to deploy it as a web service that processes incoming requests. The `gender` field comes from a massive upstream system, and I have no control over whether additional values for `gender` will be added in the future.

What are your thoughts on tying-in assertions to the web service in this type of scenario? Something like this, in Python:

    gender = request['gender']
    possible_gender_values = {'male', 'female'}

    assert gender in possible_gender_values, 'Unexpected value for gender, ""{}""'.format(gender)

I think there are two schools on thought on this. One would be to let error pass silently (i.e. provide a null result back to the requestor). The other would be to count the number of errors that occur in the web service and alert after a critical point that the model should probably be retrained, taking into account the new discrete levels.

Whenever you Read any Tech blog or Watch any tech video Channel on youtube, You must have noticed most of these blogs have video and articles on Machine Learning. Machine Learning today is the hottest and most talked about Topic among Tech Enthusiasts and Tech Professional. So as a Tech Newbie there must be a Question in your mind what is Machine Learning ?.  
So In This Article, I will give you information in Simple words as to what is Machine Learning? And what is its significance? All This information will help you in clearly understand Machine Learning as Tech Beginner.

## What is Machine Learning?

Have you ever did programming on a computer or write a code on the program. IF you have then you must be aware that when you write a code you are basically instructing a Computer to carry out a certain task that you have given to computer through those codes. For Example, if you are doing a programming in Java, C, C++ etc, you write codes and then you run those codes on programming Software or a compiler which convert these code into low-level Programming language which can be read and Understood by the Computer. Do You think a computer canFunction without Programming. Can it carry out the task on itself without any programming? Then I would like to tell you that it can and how is that possible, It is through Machine Learning.  
Machine Learning is an Artificial Intelligence System or a Form which makes the computer to Learn, develop and Adapt themselves to the new Data without any specific Programming.  


## Application of Machine Learning

* A help vector machine is a classifier that partitions its info space into two districts, isolated by a straight limit. Here, it has figured out how to recognize high contrast circles.
* Another arrangement of machine learning assignments emerges when one considers the coveted yield of a machine-learned system.
* In grouping, inputs are isolated into at least two classes, and the student must create a model that appoints concealed contributions to at least one (multi-name characterization) of these classes. This is normally handled in an administered way. Spam sifting is a case of grouping, where the information sources are email (or other) messages and the classes are ""spam"" and ""not spam"".
* In relapse, likewise a managed issue, the yields are nonstop instead of discrete.
* In bunching, an arrangement of information sources is to be isolated into gatherings. Not at all like the arrangement, the gatherings are not known already, making this regularly an unsupervised errand. Thickness estimation finds the circulation of contributions to some space.
* Dimensionality diminishment streamlines contributions by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Subject demonstrating is a related issue, where a program is given a rundown of human dialect records and is entrusted with discovering which reports cover comparable themes.
* Among different classifications of machine learning issues, figuring out how to learn takes in its own particular inductive predisposition in light of past understanding. Formative learning, expounded for robot learning, creates its own particular groupings (additionally called educational modules) of learning circumstances to aggregately secure collections of novel abilities through self-governing self-investigation and social cooperation with human educators and utilizing direction components, for example, dynamic learning, development, engine collaborations, and impersonation.",0,0

But I'm looking into modelling the number of days a sow (i.e. female pig) takes from weaning her litter until being bred again. The sow's backfat (millimetres of fat on a specific area of her back) is measured using an ultrasound tool at three points: at farrowing (giving birth to the litter), at weaning (nursing off her litter) and 30 days after weaning.

For now, the backfat at farrowing (sometimes called 115-day, as the gestation period for sows is around 115 days) is the most important item to look at.

Here are some graphs I made in my initial analysis. I simply used the plot() and abline() functions in R. I fit a linear model - lm() - on the data.

[Farrowing backfat](https://imgur.com/a/2ajTawF)

The above image should give you an idea of the structure of the data. Basically, the goal is to have as many sows as possible bred within 7 days after weaning.

As you can see, for the sows bred within 7 days seem to have little relationship to farrowing backfat and form their own sort of flat group. For the sows bred more than 7 days after weaning, a trend seems to exist.

So when I fit my basic linear regression model it doesn't seem to express the data very well. So, I am looking for help in identifying other modelling techniques that might be useful for this data.

From the reading I've done, it looks like performing some data transformation or trying to fit some non-linear model to the data would be my best options. However, when looking for specific techniques, it seems difficult to me to find a direction to go in. Without a good knowledge of non-linear distributions it seems somewhat arbitrary in what model to choose. It seems to require some intuition.

So I am looking for some help in what methods/techniques to go for with this data.

I really would like to learn python (or R) and be more competitive for data analyst positions at other companies. Is it worth taking a week off work for this professional development? It's actually an event I saw posted here as an ad on this subreddit. Here is what they will cover - 

Day 1: Introduction to Pandas - Selecting Subsets of Data

Perhaps the most popular and widely used open-source data wrangling tool of the times, the Pandas library and its main data structures, the Series and DataFrame will be introduced. Selecting subsets of data is a very common yet confusing task that must be mastered in order to be effective with Pandas.

Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine

Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.

Day 3: Tidy Data

Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data (as described by Hadley Wickham) provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.

Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.

Day 5: Applied Machine Learning

After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built.

It's small (roughly 1cm in length, and 5mm in diameter). It's feed via a conveyor with a groove so that the axis of the part is parallel to the conveyor direction. The parts are not necessarily equally spaced.

Sometimes these parts have cracks which can cause quality defects or machine stops. It's desirable to inspect each part for cracks or fragments before feeding into the machine. Bad parts can be blown off the conveyor at a certain point.

What is the easiest way (algorithm) to inspect this using computer vision? If you can install cameras that can take photos of each part at different angles, what algorithm would you use?

I study probability theory again because stats are using it everywhere.

Nothing makes you understand concepts better than implementing a program for them. Are there study materials somewhere that enables one to read the book on the topic and then guide through implementation of it? For instance, I have taken a neurals networks class which was theoretical but had a heavy practical component implementing them, to readlly grok the material.

For stats, it would be something like: I just read about linear regression, so someone has material on it, guiding one to implement that in probably Python and it's scientific packages.",0,0

About me: I graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering from a very good--but not top tier--university. Solid grades: 3.25 GPA, was slowed down by some major health issues, but 3.7 major GPA and overall much better performance in the second half of college. I currently work as an IT consultant at a top tier tech company with 1 year experience. The type of company people (think) they want to work at lol. Tl;dr is I took the job for the name and the money, I knew going into it this was not the career I wanted in the long run.&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;  &lt;Enter&gt;

I was pretty set on doing a bootcamp, first Trilogy, then General Assembly and looking for a new job but when it came time to pull the trigger I just felt like the chance of me ending up in a ""better"" position than what I'm in right now seemed slim. So I'm still working. I'm not throwing shade at all, I honestly don't know the type of people who do bootcamps but I imagine I'm in a ""better"" position (excuse the word choice) than the average person who goes to one. But I could be wrong.&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;  &lt;Enter&gt;

I also found out that online masters programs like U of I and Georgia Tech are way more affordable than I thought. So grad school is now a realistic option for me. The only hard part would be getting accepted since I don't have a CS background and the only formal programming I've done was 1 C++ course like 5 years ago. I've been learning python on Datacamp for the last few months and bought a textbook but it's hard to put the time in with my demanding job. 

&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;  &lt;Enter&gt;

**This is where I need help:**

1) Am I good candidate for a grad program?&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;  &lt;Enter&gt;

2) If not how can I become a good candidate? (Udacity nanodegree? A less expensive bootcamp? etc. anything I need ideas)&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;  &lt;Enter&gt;

3) Anyone know of other cheaper online grad programs besides U of I and Georgia Tech? (those are 20k and 7k respectively, something like Syracuse is +60k which is out of the question). I'd like to have more than 2 options when I apply.&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;  &lt;Enter&gt;

4) Or is just doing a bootcamp sufficient? &lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;  &lt;Enter&gt;

So what happens if the test set results are bad, and what if the model's performance is variable based on the data selected for the training/test set? Currently, I'm working with a data set of only 24 observations, and I'm using 5-fold cross validation to hyper-tune parameters. However, based on certain seeds I set, I could get phenomenal Test set RMSE's, and sometimes really bad ones. My goal is to find the best ML Algorithm and features to use in my model.

To resolve this issue, I built a loop that, given a certain ML algorithm, will take a list of feature combinations and use sampling to determine each model's mean RMSE &amp; its standard deviation. Given the algorithm and list of features, the loop will go through 30 iterations, in which each a random seed is generated (to create the training/test sets) and a model is fit to the training data using grid search. Then, the RMSE for that iteration is computed with the test data. The mean is calculated for all 30 iterations, and a table is created where you can see the Mean RMSE and SD for each combination of parameters.

I have no idea if this is a good idea, but given the lack of data I have, this is the only solution I can think of to be confident in the best model to reduce bias and variance as much as possible (analyzing the mean Test RMSE's and SD's). I just wanted to get everyone's thoughts on this procedure. For XGB Tree, the computational time is god awful, but it's fine for using Random Forests and Linear Regression.",12,2

I have 3 classes - positive, neutral, and negative.

I have many features for example:
- In what state the car was purchased 
- price of the car
- the make of the car
- the model of the car
- the model year of the car
- the year the car was purchased
- the country origin of the car
etc...

I am trying to model the data so that I can create a list of 4 criteria when purchasing a car that will maximize the historical customer satisfaction data.

Right now, the approach I am using is decision tree regression, where I set positive as 1, neutral as 0, and negative as -1. Then I run the decision tree regression on the data and fit the decision tree.

Then I look into the decision tree rule/path that has the highest mean squared error(mse).

Ultimately, I am trying to get the highest mean score with the greatest number of samples from a recommendation list that would look something like:

Buy a 2012-2017 Toyota Camry, or a 2014-2016 Honda Civic, in the states of TX, NJ, VA, RI, or NY. Using these recommendations the historical data has a mean customer satisfaction score of 0.86 from a total of 200k samples.

I'm a lowly geophysicist that specializes in seismology so please forgive any statistical or data science ignorance that I might display. 

I've recently started work on identifying and analyzing earthquake swarms contained within a large catalog of what are ""normal"" earthquakes. I work mainly in MATLAB, but am also capable using Python. Thus far, I've defined a space-time distance metric and used MATLAB's cluster algorithm to find the ""swarm"" earthquakes that are embedded within the larger catalog of about \~110,000 ""normal"" events. I have found \~100 swarm sequences that contain \~20,000 events that meet my space-time criteria in the clustering algorithm and thus are deemed a ""swarm event"".  So swarm sequence 1 might have 609 events, swarm sequence 2 might have 732 events, etc. 

Moreover, I've calculated several swarm time and magnitude metrics that I'd like to use to further classify these swarm events into groups that may have some particular physical / mechanical interpretation. For example, I've calculated the skewness and kurtosis of the times the swarm events occur, the median time differences between events in each swarm, the time the largest event in each swarm occurs, the time difference between the largest and 2nd largest event in each swarm, etc. I've also normalized these metrics so that values are 0-1. So I have 100 swarms and 6-8 ""dimensions"" that are the time / magnitude metrics.

I recently learned about t-SNE and thought I would try to employ this method as opposed to something like PCA. My reasoning behind this is that PCA looks to maximize variance. I don't want to do that, I want to find relationships in the higher dimensional data set (6-8 dimensions) that cluster into smaller groups (2-3) in the lower dimensional space. I've toyed around with MATLAB's t-sne tool a bit and am starting to get results that are separating into ""clusters"", but I'm not convinced because I get such wildly different results from small tweaks to options in the t-sne function.  

Am I on the right track by using t-sne? Should I used another method for this ?

The interview process is a different set of skills, and I have gotten less rusty and better over the past few months. I have had bad interviews and good interviews. I don't think I have had a great, home-run type of interview. I have also run into not so great, or just plain bad interviewers. All these things are expected. 

I do think the gap between my interview skills and my actual work performance is quite large. I don't think the interview process is a good proxy for future performance as a data scientist and as a process is inconsistent at best; I don't expect data scientists to be good interviewers and they usually aren't. But the process is starting to bother me since I keep getting rejected. Obviously one reaction is to just keep going, since rejection is an inherent part of the process, and keep on working on my interviewing skills. But I am starting to ask myself if it even makes sense anymore? I have read about people spending a year interviewing and practicing their interviewing skills for hours every day. Is it crazy to think *that* is crazy? I have a family and some other difficult circumstances (which I will not state here, but it's something very few people have to deal with) that make something like that quite unreasonable; and I am pretty exhausted trying to do so. 

A few things I have noticed in my interviews, this is purely anecdotal. Some people have been surprised to see me. My assumption is that they were expecting something different from what they envisioned. Perhaps it is because I am older older? I don't know, most people think I am much younger than I actually am. Maybe more intimidating (I don't think I am)? I went to good schools but definitely I don't really fit the image of the type of people I run into at these companies. I come from a combat sports background (since I was a kid), so scars above my eyes and cauliflower ears. One person could not look me in the eyes, which threw me off. I don't think I am hideous to look at, at least my wife says so! It's hard to describe.  But I have yet to run into an interviewer who I could say, ""oh, this person is like me."" And, on their end, they may be thinking the same thing about me.  I don't think that should be important, but I know that empirically it is a factor. 

So, I have been thinking about quitting the field the past few days, since it has become extremely, extremely frustrating. I think that feeling will go away since I hate quitting. But also wondering if it would be actually more reasonable to find something else to do. I am not sure what given the skills I have; which include:

ETL pipelines

I do have some assets. I have R, PowerBI and accesses to a massive sql database.

The deficits I have are that my computer is extremely underpowered, the sql dB is a complete mess and is being held together with duct tape and there is no documentation or relationships made. 

In my mind I can invest time in 3 areas at least while at work.

If I work on R Id like to get better at writing functions and doing automated data management. Im probably at an intermediate skill level right now. If I invest in R it would be focusing on the computer science aspect of coding.

I can also work on my PowerBI skills. This skill seems really in demand. The downside is that with the poorly designed sql dB and other organizational issues its almost impossible to make meaningful data insights and Im not allowed to publish because my organization is terrified of the cloud.


The other skills I could work on are scripting skills like SQL and PowerShell.

I think this lends itself to a multivariate forecasting problem, where changes in factors X, Y, and Z are assumed to have some impact on network I/O.

Since the goal of this project is to be **proactive**, wouldn't it be a good idea to ""lag"" the `Network IO` dependent variable to better identify combinations of activity for X, Y, and Z that lead to higher network I/O? By lagging I mean something like this:

I'm about to finish my double-major in Physics and Astrophysics from a large university (expected GPA ~4.0 if that means anything). I entered this major with the intent of pursuing a Ph.D. in Astrophysics; however, as my senior year approaches, I'm having second thoughts. I do love astronomy, but academia has become increasingly unattractive to me (worryingly high rates of depression among grad students, gross underpayment of grad students, imposter syndrome, etc.), so I'm looking into other options.

I frequently hear of Astronomy PhDs ending up in data science, and oftentimes loving it. And I suspect that I could find a great deal of enjoyment in data science as well. I say this because my favorite part of my research projects has always been in the nitty-gritty of using Python to reduce and visualize data for analysis (the analysis is a lot of fun too!), especially with particularly large datasets. Broadly speaking, I suppose I enjoy using tools like Python to reduce data into an interpretable format in order to constrain the answers to some big questions.

So my questions for anyone in this subreddit are:

* **In your own experience, do you enjoy your job as a data scientist? i.e. Does it keep you interested?** My main--and perhaps naive--concern about pursuing data science is that I might fall into a boring, unexciting job. I don't suspect this would be good for my own mental health.

* **Do I even have a shot at this career without a degree in CS, stats, etc.?** My loose plan is to become proficient in Pandas and SQL before graduation, and then apply for paid internships after graduation. Hopefully these wouldn't reject me on the basis of my non-CS background.

Again, I'm sorry if I'm annoying anyone with this perhaps hackneyed post. I'm certainly under a great deal of stress right now because I was so sure of what I wanted to do for so long. I'm by no means ruling out grad school entirely... I just don't think I'm ready to make that huge commitment quite yet, and data science is looking very attractive from my perspective.

But I'm still struggling a bit and could do with some help.  


A little info about the project: Since I have a background in robotics, I recently decided to try my hand at applying what I've learned there. In case you don't know, a common university project given to mechatronic engineers is to build a robot that [balances on two wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW9SlK1hiZA). It uses an accelerometer/gyroscope to sense it's orientation, and a deterministic algorithm to control motor output to achieve balance (commonly, a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) is used). Some will also include an encoder on the wheels so that it can balance on a specific spot instead of just trying to stay vertical.

I built one of these with a raspberry pi and it works very well. I decided to see what kinds of learning algorithm can be used to balance it as alternatives to the PID loop. I decided to use my original code to generate a data set of inputs to outputs, and then use these to train a machine learning algorithm. Specifically, the data is as follows:

* Inputs were the current angle error (setpoint minus angle reading from the accelerometer), the rate of change of angle (from the gyroscope), and the approximated integral of the angle over time (calculated from the.  
* Outputs (labels) were the motor power signals

I used this to record about 30 seconds of balancing, wherein I bumped the robot around a little so that the data set included how the robot handles disturbances. I fed this into a few different regressors in scikit-learn, and found that random forest regressors performed the best (lowest RMS error). I am now in the process of writing a new control algorithm that uses this model to balance. Just comparing the PID outputs to what the random forest regressor would produce for a separate test set shows that the two are very similar, so I'm fairly sure it will work.

This kind of train/test/implement methodology is ok, but if I wanted to turn this into a reinforcement algorithm, how would I go about it? I ideally would like my robot to learn from its own balancing, and get better as it goes. There are some limitations which I'm sure will prevent perfect balance (one example is backlash in the motor gearboxes). I just don't know how to start with this kind of algorithm. I can start a separate thread in my python script that updates the model in the background as new information as it is collected, but I don't know the practicalities of how I program in this reward, and how the algorithm can know that it's ""improving"" instead of just changing. I am starting to learn about Q-learning, but I don't think it's very applicable here.

I've been working as a data scientist for a little under a year now, coming straight from an undergrad in CS+math. Sadly, I recently got a really bad performance review at work, being told that I have a huge skill gap in my ability to tackle open-ended problems (among some other things, but that's beyond the scope of this post). 

Due to increased anxiety getting in the way of my mental health and my ability to do this job, I've decided to quit and find a new environment to start over again. During this in-between period as I apply for jobs (I live in silicon valley so hopefully unemployment won't be that long??? idk), I also want to work on myself and address some of these skill gaps, in particular the ability to pare down an abstract, ill-defined question into a concrete, executable task, and the ability to translate that into actionable insights. 

I realize it's a lot easier to get experience at this (a) at a job, or (b) if you're doing research as a grad student, but those two options are out of my reach at the moment. I know that simply building ML models on Kaggle isn't the answer, what do you think I should do instead?

I've managed to add R and SQL to my resume, along with two years' experience working on churn and pricing models. I've established myself as the go-to person for all things R and ML related in my group, which is great but also means I'm not learning from people around me. By 'fake data scientist' I mean my work is limited in three ways:

* I do entirely in-memory modelling, nothing really warrants the 'big data' approach (hence I never have reason to leave R)
* I work entirely offline, we don't maintain the live environment for our models and have no contact with them after handing them over (the live system is essentially lookup tables so not much going on there anyway)
* I'm now removed from data warehousing completely, as we have a separate team handling this and very little contact between us and them. 

In some ways my current role is a dream job, as it's entirely focused on the models and free of the messy data processing stage, but the only areas I'm learning in now are related to the industry. I'm worried about being typecast in this 'fake data science' role and never being considered for roles in companies with more sophisticated data problems (I've never made it past the first round of interviews in tech companies for example). 

My question is: If I stay on this track, and add python and C++/Java and a few kaggle projects to my CV, will I have a chance at a 'real' DS position in a couple of years, or am I missing too many fundamentals to get there without going back to the drawing board (more courses etc) . ",22,55

Most definitions I've seen of ""data scientist"" seem to imply that these people are absolute wizards who have mastered all of applied mathematics and computer science. Their knowledge is supposedly so vast and broad--yet deep at the same time--it's as if they're a type of scientific unicorn. For instance, [this](https://blog.udacity.com/2014/11/data-science-job-skills.html) Udacity blog post lists 8 essential skills that a data scientist must have. Among them are programming, statistics, machine learning, multivariable calculus &amp; linear algebra, software engineering, data visualization, and communication. 

Now, maybe I'm the dumb one in the room here, but I don't see how *anyone* could possibly have all of these skills at any reasonably competent level, unless of course they're 50+ years old and have been studying within this realm for a long time. If you studied applied math &amp; statistics somewhat extensively, then you likely have the calculus, linear algebra, and statistics down pat; If you studied computer science somewhat extensively, then you likely have the programming and software engineering down pat. But can anyone--especially a young person, say a recent graduate in one of these fields--really have *all* of these skills down pat? I don't think so. 

I think a lot of people are discouraged from pursuing data science because there seems to be no entry-level. It's either you know everything or you don't. The barrier to entry is seemingly colossal. And god knows companies don't like training employees anymore. Are they right to feel discouraged?

Is data science really exactly as its portrayed (i.e., as a hyper-technical field reserved only for a small subset of elite PhDs), or is the reality a bit a different? ",11,1

Weightlifting related.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8z0hug/would_machine_learning_be_useful_for_this_project/,gi_funk,1531645869,"I'm working on a project that began as a simple app for me to track my weightlifting progress. It's a  web app where I input the exercise, weights/sets/reps, rate of perceived exertion,  it's datestamped, and all this goes into a mysql database. Much better than writing notes and putting it in a spreadsheet when I get home. 

Getting stronger is a pretty simple process that is well understood, and there are established guidelines for creating a program. The programs change over time based on how much progress you are making. 

It starts with high frequency full body training (usually with squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press, rows, and chin ups done 2-3x per week) and linear progress. 

Eventually this progress stalls and you have to switch to a periodized program that is based on percentages of your one rep max. Progress is slower, but stable. Some weeks you make progress, sometimes you miss numbers you hit previously. This is where the RPE (rate of perceived exertion) comes in. If you hit the numbers but it was very hard, you lower the weights 5-10&amp;#37; and work back up. There are a few more tenets of strength training like this.

I think it would be useful to create a program that tells me what workout I'm doing today and adjusts my program based on my progress. I think this could be done with some tedious if/then statements, but I was thinking that a ML algorithm might be able to learn how to make these adjustments with enough data. I have a few friends that have asked to use the app and once I get it to support multiple users I will let them.  With the data I might be able to gather over the next 6 months-year, I was thinking it may be enough to train a ML algorithm. 

Is this a feasible use case for ML? I dont really know what I'm talking about here.  ",6,5

I ended the MOOC on PGMs some time ago and I would like to practice the techniques presented there.

What would be a good way to start applying and feel comfortable with PGMs? Implementing them by myself in a language? Using toolbox or a framework on this? Playing a little in a kaggle challenge?

Also, I would like to use this  thread to know: what are some good applications for PGM that, in general, is a best option using them than using the deep learning framework?

also, I paid for a lower end html and css bootcamp with GA where I got a solid grasp the basics, and I've finished half the codecademy Javascript course, which is pretty easy and I've enjoyed it so far.

I know html, css, and Javascript would be useful for Web Development, but I have no desire to pursue that anymore.

I know I want to pursue data science for sure now, but I don't know where to start?

Should I revisit the basics of C and finish the javascript course, or should I just jump straight into R,SQL and Python, and if so, in what order?

The Georgia Tech OMSA MicroMasters program starts on 8/20. I want to transition into a data role. Is this program enough to get my foot in the door?

**Background**

Working as a junior systems analyst with weekly travel requirements for the last 2.5 years. My current contract is coming to an end in a few months and I am not keen on doing the same type of work or traveling anymore. 

Data analytics has had my eye for a while now. I like statistics and math, absolutely loved my Database courses in college, and I like writing dumb little programs in Python. Working with data seems like a good cross section of things that actually interest me.

That being said, I'm pretty rusty and need to brush up/learn a few more skills in the month leading up to the program.

**Plan**

Self study efforts end up half-hearted by work and travel requirements. I'm considering taking some time off after my contract ends to hunker down and focus on this program and learning. This won't be any immediate financial risk, but it means explaining a 3-4 month employment gap in an interview. I get mixed responses for how serious that gap is.

Is the OMSA MicroMasters program enough to get started? Is the quality of education enough to justify a gap in employment to an interviewer? Am I overthinking how hard it is to get my foot in the door?

Reddit, what is your opinion on my Transition 1.0 plan?

The effects, if any, would be small, so it requires a bit of analysis to find. I gathered data on what colour jersey teams wore in each world cup match going back to 1930 (and got to watch a lot of great highlights doing it) and analysed the effects.

# Methods

The biggest determinant of a match outcome will be skill. To look at other effects you have to (attempt to) remove that from the game. To approximate skill I used the team's Elo ranking at the start of the tournament. As expected, higher ranked teams [score more goals](https://imgur.com/Cj8y4Us) against lower ranked teams.

Taking this relationship, you can add goals to the lower Elo teams, and/or subtract goals from the higher ranked teams and [create a ""fair"" matchup](https://imgur.com/a/9m71KG4). This is similar to having them play with a spread. This is rough, but it does a decent job of removing the effect of team skill from the matchups.

Once adjusted, you can rerun the tournaments and see where teams end up with these new scores. We're still having teams that won in reality but lost in their adjusted games go through, so it will still bias the best teams, but we can see that [things look a lot more even now](https://imgur.com/gallery/olZrZXz).

# Results

Let's look at [what impact colour had](https://imgur.com/gallery/1HBpY1w). The unadjusted line shows how good teams that wear that colour are. Teams that wear green are not good at scoring goals. Teams that wear black are good at scoring goals. This doesn't have to do with colour yet, it just happens to be that way. When you adjust for skill most colours even out and move towards the 1.5 goal mark. Green and orange basically have the same effect. There is a small detrimental effect of wearing white, but the effect is small.

The notable exception is black. Though the best teams wear black, and it does adjust downwards when you adjust for skill, it still is a massive outlier. Skill-adjusted teams wearing black score almost a whole goal more per game than they're expected to.

In fact, the team wearing a black jersey have[ won every match they've played](https://imgur.com/gallery/O45Qf8O) in the world cup! Note: counting draws as neither wins not losses. Their record is 12 wins, 0 losses, 2 draws.

Granted, there have only been 14 such matches, but that's still an impressive feat. When controlling for skill that record goes to a still impressive 7 wins 6 draws, and 1 loss (South Africa - Mexico 2010).

# Conclusion

So what's going on? Does wearing a black jersey give teams a competitive advantage? It really seems to, but keep in mind only 1.72&amp;#37; of games have been played by teams in black jerseys, [and only recently](https://imgur.com/gallery/EhcAWAU). Good teams tend to wear black, but even when you give them a disadvantage to the point where a game is a ""fair"" 50/50 chance, they still win way more than chance. Hopefully more teams will play in black and we can see if this trend bears out.

[Bonus chart](https://imgur.com/gallery/eJ9DI3F) showing specific colour matchups.

Tl;dr: Wearing black seems to give a [distinct advantage](https://imgur.com/gallery/O45Qf8O), but a small sample size means take that with a pinch of salt.",5,0

What are your thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8zayha/accepted_off_nyu_ms_data_science_waitlist_still/,scoobyboo,1531748140,"Hey Data Scientists and ML practitioners!

I was accepted to the GA Tech OMSCS program a while back, and Ive been eagerly awaiting the Fall 2018 Semester to begin taking courses. I plan to specialize in ML, with the ultimate goal of working as a ""Machine Learning Engineer"" after graduation. Also, I plan to do the program full timei.e take 2-3 courses a semester and do an internship in summer 2019.

To be more precise, I hope to qualify myself for jobs like these:

[ML Engineer @ Spotify](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=746529048&amp;f_JT=F&amp;keywords=machine%20learning%20engineer)

[ML Engineer @ Quantum Black](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=639204121&amp;f_JT=F&amp;keywords=machine%20learning%20engineer&amp;location=Greater%20Boston%20Area&amp;locationId=us%3A7&amp;start=50)

(Note: I hope to find my full time post-grad job in Boston)

With that said, I was also just accepted off the WL to NYU Center for Data Science (CDS) for the MS Data Science degree. Getting accepted here gives me a great feeling of validation, because I left my jobwhich was in an unrelated engineering fieldat end of last year, to devote all my time to grad school apps, and taking a few Data Science and CS courses to prepare for grad school.

I crunched the numbers on both, and with NYU I would incur \~$50K in debt, while with GA Tech, I would incur $0 in debt.

Costs Estimate for reference for 2 years: 

NYU Tuition: $66K, Total Living Costs: $44K NYU Total Costs: $110K 

GA Tech Tuition: $7K, Total Living Costs: $42K GA Tech Total Costs: $49K

Both are top programs and will give me an equally prestigious piece of paper at the end, so when comparing them, I thought about the educational experience each would offer me. The questions I asked myself are; Is $50K debt worth the on campus experience of NYU, interacting in person with students and professors who are at the top of their field? Is it worth the networking opportunities? Is the on campus live learning experience worth it? Will completing the NYU degree give me an advantage quite literally worth $50K when going for jobs like I linked above?

If a program like GA Tech didnt exista top 10 CS program with ML focus, for $7K, with no online designation on the degreeI would do NYU in a heartbeat, but that is not the case. 

So, right now I am leaning towards doing OMSCS, and graduating debt free. What are your thoughts? I'd like to especially hear from ML and Data Science people already working in industry.",5,0

I am currently working on clustering (k-means) a big dataset (several millions of individuals). Due to its size, I had to create a sample to run my clustering fast enough.

Now that I obtained my desired clusters, I would like to apply my model on the whole dataset i.e. assign each point of my dataset to a cluster. 

What method should I use ? Should I see to which center of cluster my point is the closest to, or should I run a KNN ?

Due to the fact that I used K-means for the initial clustering, I think that the first option seems to be the most appropriate.

I've crawled out of the lurker shadows to become a first-time poster and am hoping I can make a decent post, but let's get to the point!

I work in the Business Intelligence field in Healthcare for a multi-state organization.  Our executives have finally caught the data science bug and there is top-level movement now to create a data science position and team.  The major problem is that no one really knows what to call it or what data science is about - they just know they want it.

Enter me.  My management team is aware that I have some skills in this field and that I've expressed interest in pursuing further education in this field.  They've asked me to flesh out what our org would call a Data Scientist, what the role would look like and how it would interact with other roles, research some use cases, and put together a presentation in case this needs to be shown to the execs.

In case some of you are wondering, here's an overview of some of my skills, knowledge, education, etc.:

* B.B.A. in Management Information Systems
* 2+ years in BI as an analyst/developer
* Data architecture and integration
* Data wrangling
   * API calls to web scraping
* Data visualization
   * Tableau Dev
   * Simple to complex dashboards and vizzes
* Geospatial analysis
* Semantic layer development
* Web and mobile app development
* Analyzing disparate datasets with python
* Union contract analytics
   * How to quantify normal to weird questions during negotiations that typical analysts can't answer
* Completed DataCamp's ""Data Scientist with Python"" track plus a few other courses on the site
* Machine learning experience:
   * Participated in a Kaggle competition hosted by Home Depot (awhile ago)
      * Text mining and prediction with XGBoost
   * Did a POC model to demo some of Tableau's capabilities with their python integration via TabPy
      * Trained a model using GBM to predict if an employee would term within their first year of employment based on user input from a dashboard
   * Personal project using NLP packages to conduct sentiment analysis and topic identification of Twitter data.  
      * Still not sure on the entire direction of this though
* Primary languages:  SQL, Python
* Secondary languages:  C#, Java, Javascript, R

I've (hopefully) made it clear to my team that at best, my experience is closest to the bottom of what some other orgs with DS teams would consider a Junior Data Scientist, but that I would try me best to provide valuable input on what I think this role would look like.  My main benefit from this is getting my foot in the door to this career field - I would potentially be occupying a membership role on this team instead of moving up in my current role later this year.  Plus the experience of starting an initiative like this from the ground-up is an invaluable learning opportunity.

Enter you.  I want to hear from any people involved in the DS community.  Yes, I've done research looking for what other orgs are calling Data Scientists, but most articles are filled with buzzwords and junk that makes it seem the author has little idea beyond what everyone else, and every other article, is saying about the DS field.  I'm hoping to gain some opinions from industry professionals or even those who operate with DS teams.  I have some broad questions below and I'll include any quick thoughts I have on it as well.  Any answer/comment, however specific, general, or off-topic they may be, would be useful for me.

**The broad questions are:**

* **What would your dream wants of a DS role be if you were in a position like me that had some control of the creation of the role?**
* **How would you describe the field of Data Science?**
   * I think of it as a thought process when interacting with data, mainly because I don't think the end-goal is to always have a predictive model, but could be something more simple like correlation analysis to gain an understanding of drivers for a metric.  It's the science of how to tackle and solve/investigate specific to abstract organizational problems with data.
* **What do you call a Data Scientist?**
   * A person who can take the above problems and transform them from business problems to workable DS problems, wrangle needed data, clean it, transform it, model it, present it, and not only provide answers to the problem, but help determine where and how to change a process, test the change, and assist with implementing a ""full circle"" solution where any data/model is a driver of that solution so impact and success/failure can be measured.
* **What should a DS role do vs NOT do? IE:**
   * A DS might need to scrape some data from the web for a given project, but shouldn't deal with typical ETL processes
   * A DS needs to be able to visually present findings, but shouldn't be the fullstack production dashboard developer - leave it to the BI team
   * This question mainly comes from seeing numerous articles where a Data Scientist was hired for a job where they thought they'd be doing job X but ended up doing something that fit another role/department doing job Y

Also, my current thoughts on recommendations for the team are:

* HIRE A SENIOR DATA SCIENTIST ASAP
   * This team will fail without experience
* Find the low hanging fruit and start at a crawl
   * Tons of potential use cases already
   * It's a matter of finding the one(s) which are definite wins, within the team's current capabilities, that will demonstrate the value of a DS team

TL;DR

I've found myself in a position where I can help define a Data Scientist role at my organization and possibly step into it.  I'm reaching out to the community for ANY input on what they call Data Science and what the dream wants of the Data Scientist role would be if you were in my position.

[x-post /r/bigdata],https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8zf0fk/node_red_vs_apache_nifi_xpost_rbigdata/,please_to_help,1531776219,"I'm interested in setting up simple http endpoints (sometimes with forms or just to handle json), processing messages from queues, batch processing, and easily listening to streams of data from social media and rss feeds. Also the more features that can be added on, like [creating dashboards from data](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard), is a plus.


Has anyone used both and have opinions on how Node Red and Apache Nifi compare? I've been testing both of these for the past two days, and it feels like Node Red is easier to use but Apache Nifi has marginally more processors. 
Node Red seemed to have a lot more fun toys out of the box but Apache Nifi processors seemed to have more configuration options in case scaling ever becomes a priority.

Node Red's message passing the the `msg` json objects was really intuitive, and even though it's only been a few hours working with Nifi I still haven't really figured out how to read, manipulate, and write flow files, or how to set up an easy debug console to debug flows as easily as Node Red.

I've been doing some research on Node Red vs Nifi for the use cases I mentioned before, and I haven't seen Node Red mentioned on this subreddit before. It seems most people who would fall in the ""big data"" space use Nifi, so I would like to like it too but now I'm skeptical if that's the right choice since Node Red was ridiculously easy to setup install and make something productive within minutes.

I am going to graduate from a PhD in discrete math/geometry soon and want to find a job in data science or a closely related field. However, I could you use some advice on evaluating my skills and could use some aid on the whole application process. It is often hard to tell if I'm qualified enough to apply for certain jobs, since I feel that mathematicians, in particular, tend to be too modest and underrate themselves when we hit job the market.

So here's what I can bring to the table:

* PhD in discrete math (discrete geometry in arbitrary dimensions, combinatorics, measure theory)
* Masters with distinction &amp; minor in CS, with thesis in geometry and probability theory
* Courses attended in probability theory, statistics, CS during my studies with excellent grades
* Fluent in C/C++, Python  and used/been exposed to R, Java (during internship), Mathematica, Matlab, Fortran, Haskell, some Perl also.
* Academic writing (3 publications, very good journals), excellent in LaTeX
* Know basics in Tableau (self taught, out of curiosity)
* I'm also using things like Git, Bash (and related Linux stuff), Jupyter/IPython on daily basis
* (I'm also know things like scikit-learn, pandas etc. but haven't used those professionally, and I wouldn't consider myself fluent (yet) )

So, how strong are my qualifications? Most jobs require something like ""1,5+ experience in ML (or DS etc..) in a professional environment"", which I  lack of course. Also, how helpful will be the PhD?

Thanks, a lot for any help and advice.",11,3

I teach Tableau at a startup so it is probably safe to say that I have a good amount of BI skills/knowledge as well. I also have worked on data science and BI projects both at work.

I'm sure that I can't be the only one experiencing issues when converting a Jupyter NB to PDF. HTML conversion looks great, but having my notebooks in PDF form would be awesome (if anyone knows of a good resource to convert HTML to pdf that would also be appreciated).

The main issues I'm facing are:

 long lines of code do not wrap in the PDF
 plots and tables show up super tiny even though they look great in the HTML

Any insight would be appreciated, I've tried using nbconvert as well as just converting straight to PDF through the Jupyter browser window.

We contract these portfolios out to collection agencies and collect on them for our clients.

I've been tasked with building my first baseline forecast, essentially we build a 20 month curve for each segment (as percentage of liquidation - that is percentage of the accounts total initial balance we collect each month).

What I've done is build 20+ variables which may or may not have an influence on dollars collected, what I've found is that the initial account balance as well as 4-5 of the date differentials are the most significant predictors. Since I have to build these out into segments, I can only do a reasonable amount (10-15 max). What I've done is create 3 top segments, never paid before default, paid last 6 months before default and paid 6+ before default.

I've built these curves on the historical 2017 data and forecast them out into the first 6 months of 2018. What I've found is that with this segmentation my training data over approximates total $ collected so far in 2018 to be 4% higher than it really is. This is OK but since 4% actually amounts to a good deal of profit for us it ideally needs to be +/- 2% to get anyone to sign off on it.

What I'm wondering is if anyone has any suggestions on how to possibly solve this. The only things I've thought of so far are:

1. Get more predictive variables, we have requested more data from the client
2. Create more segments with other predictive variables, we already have 12 segments though so another classification layer would potentially bump this up to 24-36 segments no bueno
3. Scrap the segmentation plan and build a model that approximates individual account liquidation month by month, I' built a random forest and it was 6% out on $ collected in month 6 - however, building 20 random forests that predict month 1 to 20 may yield better accuracy? 
4. My random forest wasnt actually too bad, but I visualised it the predicted vs. actuals and the 0,1 abline through it was skew, low values were over predicted  by 5-10% and high values were underpredicted by 5-10% on average

This is my first job and I want to impress my boss/co-workers, one other thought we had was to build a neural network using an R package and see how that predicts.

My dream is to be a data scientist in sports field.

Because I like sports a lot. Anyway, let's get straight to the point.

My major is Business Management, because of my dream job, now I'm thinking of taking another major.

So I'm thinking of between Statistics and Computer Science. 

I have met professors from Statistics and Computer Science in my university.

 **A professor from Statistics** said that taking Statistics major would help me achieve to have the job.

And if I start taking the classes from Statistics, I would be dealing with many statistical concepts, dealing with

many examples and learn how to analyze the data. 

 **And a professor from Computer Science** said that if I take a major in Computer Science, the classes wouldn't really

teach the things I want to do(dealing with big datas...), but teach all basic things of Computer Science and heavily focus on the language C and Java. 

So, now I'm confused. I thought that I would do Computer Science as my second major, but now I'm told that this wouldn't really help me dealing with data, but statistics classes would help. 

**What do you guys think? Which one do you think is better? Statistics or Computer Science?** I'm sure people who are here, have a general idea of the steps that I need to follow to be a data scientist(Specifically in sports, but it is okay just to be a data scientist too)

I really like computers and programming  I really like statistics. Just kind of made sense to me, so Ive taken a lot of interest. I posted something very similar on r/statistics and was told that this would be the place that could give more informative answers.

Im planning to go into a basic data analysis job and then transition into something with more computer programming like data scientist.

What is the best route to do this? Should I get a major in statistics, minor in CS, then work to gain experience then go back for statistics masters/PHD?

Should I go for a major in Computer science, minor in statistics, then go for a masters/PHD in Computer Science?

Im not exactly sure how statisticians are able to gain mastery of both statistics and computer science. I definitely want to do both, but what is the best way to gain knowledge and mastery of computer science in college.

**Basically I have a lot of data about everything that goes  through my company's warehouse (Dimensions, Date of entry, Date of exit,  Sender) of each package / pallet.**

Each rack has between 3 and 6 levels (depending of the height set to each level).  The height of the levels of each rack that we use to store the cargo con be graduated.

At this moment the hight of each level of each rack and the amount of levels a rack has been set at a rough guess.

This has proven to be highly inefficient, a lot of space is not being  taken advantage of and for this reason we ran out of space and we will  be moving to a bigger warehouse.

**My task is to find the best rack setup possible ( how many  levels should each rack have and how high each level should be) for our  new warehouse, based on the data of the elements that have been stored  at our warehouse previously**

My first guess is to figure out for how long each package stays in  the warehouse (I got the entry and exit date), find if there is any  relation between the height of the packages and the time that they stay  at the warehouse, same for height and quarter of the year.

I am not sure if I should treat this as a **multiclass** problem and try to predict the amount of packages that we are gonna be receiving for each rack level height or as a **optimization** problem.

I am trying to run a propensity to buy model for one of our products for every single cusotmer in our dataset.  The output would be a lead list of most likely customers to buy our products.

I know R, SAS, and Python. I am fairly skilled at all 3. as far as skills that i can use to complete

**Dataset**

Our data is b2b sales of retail chains. 

The way our data is structured is:

Parent Company: Individual Store

For example, 

Subway:  Subway Burlington VA # 3

 I would like to predict for each store, not the corporate entity

**Issue 1: Nulls**

I have pretty spotty coverage with my data.   I have tons and tons of different data attributes about my cusotmers, but for each variable, the coverage is only around 30-60%.

The brightside is this is b2b sales and these customers belong to larger corporations and atleast one store in these corporations will have data for all the attributes.

**Example Nulls**

For example,  I may not have store Revenue for a Subway in the southside of Burlington, VA.   But, I will have the number of employees they have.

 But, i will have store revenue for a subway in the Northside of Burlington, VA. but, dont have the number of employees they have.

**Issue 2: Sampling**

For some of our products, very few of our customers buy the product.  Thus in my initial model, my accuracy was like 97%.  As it just predicted all of customers would not buy the product.

From my research, this seems to be a sample size issue.  

**Questions 1: Nulls**

 Would you impute here?  It seems like it would really prevent me from using many machine learning models if i didnt.

**Questions 2: Nulls**

Is imputing based on group averages the best way to go here? Or should i use predictive techniques like mice?

**Questions 3: Sampling**

Would be using some type of over sampling be the best approach to solve this?  If not, why?",9,6

4. A data science position.

My dream job at the moment is AI research, which makes me inclined to take the OpenAI fellowship. But it's long (6 months). I somewhat feel like I'd just be delaying really getting started in my career for more school-like experiences. And I don't have much information about fellows' outcomes after going through the program.

For the most part OpenAI has more appeal to me than Insight, because it's oriented towards research. Also OpenAI is paid. But I do know that Insight has a good track record with regard to its fellows getting jobs. Also the Insight program is much shorter.

Ultimately what I'm unsure about with the fellowships is whether, even though they are more oriented towards the career I want, whether there's any real advantage of doing them instead of  just beginning working.

* Be copied and pasted into your own environment
* Possibly be a Jupyter plugin
* Run in a pay per use cloud environment

Additional Goals:
* Wizard to connect to various cloud data sources (like BigQuery)
* Interface to join data frames
* Arbitrary combinations and ordering of pivot tables, calculations, and joins
* Interface for various plotting options (subplots, layout, size, legend, colors, etc) -- this can use both the built-in plotting library as well as something like Plotly

Stretch Goals:
* Generate equivalent code for other languages/environments like:
    * Julia
    * Pandas-JS (to run in the browser)
    * WebAssembly (if someone creates a data frame library for it)
* Pick certain parameters as inputs to expose in a dashboard
    * Appropriate widgets for parameter types (checkboxes, dropdown, sliders)
    * Code generation that includes a web server
    * Possibly upload the data and code to an online gallery (Plotly has some of this functionality)

&amp;nbsp;  

Over the past month myself and a few other data scientists have started building a little Data Science community over on discord and we're looking for new people to join us.    

&amp;nbsp;

Our vision for the channel is to gather an active, cohesive group of data scientists from different industries and academia in order to allow everyone to share their domain expertise, discuss problems, explore the many different disciplines of the profession and in doing so build friendships along the way.  
I personally believe there is a lot to be gained from such a community both professionally and humanly as I feel the medium of instant messaging is conducive to a lot more flexibility in the way we share and discuss things and this channel could be a great tool to use alongside this subreddit.    

&amp;nbsp;

Right now we have about 40 members and we're trying to organize a few channel activities such as a reading group, Kaggle contests, weekly video presentations, etc... and we'd love to get more people involved so if it seems like a community you'd like to be a part of come join us over on discord: https://discord.gg/UYNaemm

It might have something to do with the randomness of train\_test\_split within GridSearchCV but I don't think that would account for the difference. The test score function inside my common\_pipeline function is accuracy score comparing y\_test and the predicted score.

Am I misunderstanding something with the randomness or how the estimator is scored within GridSearchCV?

I use it for everything from data handling to viz to inferencial and predictive modelling.

I've just started a new job where the team uses an almost entirely non-python stack.  SQL for all data handling, GUI viz application, and SAS.  These aren't the tools I like, but I took the job because the company's mission is awesome and their's nothing wrong with the output from their data scientists and analysts - it's actually pretty exciting work.

I have no problem transposing my pandas knowledge to SQL or my [plot.ly](https://plot.ly) et al knoweldge over to the GUI application mainly because I haven't experienced a performance impact or a single roadblock I haven't been able to work around after 10 minutes on Google (which has been pleasantly surprising!).

But I'm struggling a little bit with SAS.  It's clunky to me and has so much functional overlap with the other tools that I'm struggling to fit it neatly into my workflow.  

Critically, unlike the other components of the stack, I believe I'm also the only person on the team who currently uses SAS.

So, I want to have a frank discussion with my boss about potentially switching over to python to do the work we would normally do in SAS, and I feel like I can make a pretty good case for python:

\- It's a free solution

\- Certain distributions actually come with GUI tools for those who dislike coding

\- Highly debatable, but for statistical modelling I think Python can do more than SAS.

\- The transition to python wouldn't cause any wasted knowledge for the team as no one uses the program but me

\- For those team members who want / need to learn modelling, I firmly believe python is easier to teach and learn than SAS

\- What's more, python is an awesome skill for data scientists and analysts to have and can inform the other work they do. 

\- Python plays really nicely with the other components of our stack

My hesitancy to have this frank discussion, however, is that I'm a new employee.  So my plan is to become pretty good at SAS and after I've curated some credibility as the SAS authority on our team, to then have this discussion. 

Any advice / suggestions / thoughts?  I'm also open to counter arguments to the case I outlined crudely above.  It would be really helpful for someone to make a pro-SAS case, as that would inform my discussions down the line or could even change my mind entirely.

Currently I'm a lab technician, but I grew a personal interest in Data Science, to the point that I'm going to take my second degree in that, from September.

I talked about my passion to a senior researcher in my institution, and he said that he's challanging me.

He gave me a dataset about a 2014 experiment on lab animals, to see if I can manage to find out any meaning in the data.

The dataset is a set of 72 animals, divided in many cohorts, for a study on a methabolic disease. Half of them are the controls, half are the disease model. There are sub-groups, equally divided for sex(50%M, 50%F), and age (4 different age classes, from 4 to 17 wks). For every animal, many parameters were measured, from weight to hormonal levels that could be correlated with the disease.

By now I just started cleaning the data, creating a single CSV file from the messy XLS I received, exploring the data, creating box-plots and histograms to understand parameters and their meaning in the disease.

Carving out something interesting from this dataset could help my future career, and give a meaning to 72 mouse lives.

For the basics I learnt by now, I'd tend toward trying to correlate the different groups (M/F, healthy/diseased, young/old) with the parameters, but your experience could be helpful. I don't mean to ask anyone to solve my problems, I'd appreciate a hint to the keywords that I need to google to find the tools I need by myself. My math skills are decent, and my aim is to learn.

I am looking to host all of them on a single platform. Currently I am showcasing them on my google sites website but am looking for alternatives. I know basic HTML, CSS but not much javascript and I am not planning to learn Javascript anytime soon. Here are the options I considered. Please let me know if you have other good suggestions:

1. **Google sites:**  
*pros:*  
\- Easiest to setup. I can upload PDF's, PPT's, Images from google drive and I can embed Tableau Visualizations, or anything with an embed code easily  
\- Google Analytics is very easy to integrate. Not important but it helps when I know that a recruiter has seen my profile  
\- It is free and I don't need to constantly maintain it.  
*cons:*  
\- It shows a default footer at the bottom most part. I feel that this makes my site look amateur. This cannot be removed in any way. Also, the URL is google sites URL and I can only redirect from my custom URL. Again amateurish but I can pay for GSuite and use my own URL, so that's an option  
\- Site format is rigid. I cannot add javscript, etc later if I decide to
2. **GitHub pages:**  
*pros:*  
\- Recruiters will know that I built the site by myself and it adds some credibility to my profile. Also, they can check out my GitHub etc  
\- It is free and minimal maintenance  
*cons:*  
\- I need to take care of design, etc and need to do research whenever I want to embed a new type of object.  
\- Difficult to add google analytics
3. **Medium:**  
*pros:*  
\- Good for blogs. It is free and I can reach out to a broad audience. I am seriously considering this option, along with GitHub pages  
*Cons:*  
\- Rigid format. Not good when I want to show dashboards/apps only on the webpage.
4. **Squarespace, etc:**  
*pros:*  
\- Sites are very polished and look clean.  
*Cons:*  
\- Need to pay. I am okay with paying upto $10 - 20 every month but can't keep monitoring my hosting costs, etc

What do most of you use and is there anything which is easy to setup and customize?",6,2

        I have been a undergraduate since last month and for some reason I choose to major in the Data Science &amp; Big Data. I am really curious about it but I cant help asking a question that whether does it worth. 
        Data Science is a x subject that needs knowledge of many fundamental ones. So I wouldnt learn one certain subject as deeply as other students from different subjects. 
        Moreover, Does Big Data truly have a bright future? The Big Data concept is newly raised and the education of it hasnt developed for long (compared to other ones). I am afraid that the professional knowledge and the industrial standard will change a lot after I finish my study.
        So whether does the 4 to 6 years study from now on really deserves? If you have any opinions or advice, please share with me. 
        Thank you.

P.S. I am a student from China and I plan to study abroad after graduating.

Basically, there is a certain product line our company sells with many different products. We want to classify products into different product lifecycle behaviours for future forecasts. This was a pretty simple problem to me. Glancing over the data, it seems that behavior is mostly attributed to product popularity. Also, the less popular a product is, a more erratic its lifecycle can be.

Since different products can be around the same level of popularity, but still have different levels of sales volume, I scaled the sales data for each product. Then, I plotted each product on the same plot to compare trends. I would start with the most popular product, then add more products in decreasing order of popularity. Most behaved a certain trend, some didn't (which I separated into a different group). If I kept adding products and deviations persisted, I would finalize the sales threshold to establish the certain behavioral product group.

So I show this approach to my boss, and he basically says I'm overcomplicating it. He says I should look at each product individually, and just keep looking at individual graphs and see what trends arise. Bear in mind, I'm comparing over 30 different products, potentially hundreds. So I did that to entertain the idea, and just as I expected, it was impossible to analyze and I didn't learn anything new that my original approach showed me. I don't know what to do. I feel like I cannot communicate with my boss about this because we are from different backgrounds. I literally have prove that ignoring scaling can lead them to huge forecasting errors, but I feel like my opinion is disregarded and that I'm ""overcomplicating"" the problem. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm losing my mind, this approach seems completely valid to me.",54,34

We managed to ""open a window"" in this system and now we are allowed to paste (!) some code within this platform, and use the data form there, but of course the scripts have to be translated/adapted/re-written to use the distributed processing capabilities of the cluster.

The idea is that after a period of panic selling, the price is lower than it should, and will statistically move back (and the opposite in a period of euphoric buying). Also at the beginning of the euphoric buying period, the price will go up (down in panic selling period). 

A possibility is to find the peaks in sell/buy data. Then for all time interval after the peaks, plot return from peak time to a time in the future (one or two peak widths); do the average of these plots and see if at some time the return is consistently negative/positive.

I work with clients who use pretty much every BI tool (reporting, visualization, etc.) that you could list, including but not limited to: **IBM Cognos, TM1, MicroStrategy, OBIEE, Tableau, PowerBI, QlikView, QlikSense, ThoughtSpot,** you name it.  
Every tool has its strengths and weaknesses, and in larger organizations you will almost always find 2-6 different tools being used, some together, some in different departments, sometimes tools are being phased out or migrated. So, many users have to log in to different tools, or search for information across a number of platforms. Duplicate assets are created. Time is wasted. It's difficult to look at the complete BI picture...  


If you have ever encountered this situation, I offer the following concept - **Bring all of your existing tools and informational assets together in one experience.**  


I just started working for a company that has launched a tool that consolidates multi-vendor BI tools (and other sources of information like RSS feeds, Google Drive, YouTube, External Pages, etc.) in a single user-experience. Cognos, Qlik, Tableau, etc. reports and visualization side-by-side for curated data stories, for specific audience, in addition to a federated cross-platform search and multi-tool folder structure.

**I haven't seen anything like this on the market** and would love to get others thoughts on the concept and tool, or if they have seen something like this that already exists. I think it is awesome!

* I haven't found any mentions of government data analytic work in my research (though it makes sense why they would want it). Does the old career template of gaining a few years of public sector experience then jumping into the private sector still apply here?
* I didn't get any details about what sort of data I will be working with, but does anyone know what sort of tools might be preferred in a roll like this?

I've landed an on-site interview with a data analytics company, and I was hoping to get some help and/or resources on an interview project. I was given a prompt, and a little over a week to prepare. To give some background on myself, I just graduated 2 months ago with a double major in Math and CS, and my experience with data analytics is about 1 semester of working with R and 2 years of debugging (NOT writing) python (numpy/anaconda) for physics majors doing some quantitative research. I'm not going to give the exact question because I do want to work this out on my own, but some pointers in the right direction would be awesome.  


I was given a website to go look at and gather what information I could. My next step is to act as if the website in question is a client that has missed their sales forecast for the last two fiscal months. It is assumed that I have access to all data that would reasonably be collected by a large business with a data analytics team. My task is to create an ""analysis attack plan"" in powerpoint form to illustrate how to diagnose the recent divergence from sales forecast, what hypotheses I would test, how to validate and what actions to take if any/all of the hypotheses are validated, and what recommendations I would propose to the clients' senior leadership.  


I am a strong public speaker and I tend to do very well with presentations. My main concern is that I've never created an analysis attack plan, and I've never done any sort of diagnosis to propose to a large scale business. What would be the best way to go about learning how to do this the correct way? I am prepared to put in a lot of work over the next week to prepare for this interview, so please don't hold back if you think that the time consumption for a resource might be too long.

The role of course varies from company to company (as most data science related jobs do), though often has to do with working with big data tools, databases/pipelines, and can mix elements of being a data analyst (visualization) and data scientist (ML). 

So my question to the data engineers out there include
-What is it like being a data engineer? 
-Do you enjoy the work?
-What do you think of this career path? Does it set you up well to explore other aspects of data science, or even software engineering (ex. back-end development)?

I landed a Data Analyst role a few months after I graduated where I honestly did not know what I was going to do (went in the mind set of wanting to get a job).

I've had a great time working for the past few months however I felt I haven't been able to have much challenge within my role. My excel skill has improved phenomenally and I've approached some minor SQL coding (didn't even know what SQL was before I applied for the job) and R but because of the BI tool we use there isn't much opportunity to actually apply what I've learnt in coding and I feel this will hinder my growth.

I've had a look within career development and the most appealing to my interests would be working as a data scientists. My main questions would be:

* What advice would you have in terms of career mapping towards a data scientist from a data analyst role?
* Where would be a great place to practice R and SQL skills? This is more of applying the codes in comparison to learning the codes like on w3school.

I have a background in engineering and I'm looking into data science/machine learning.

Both seem to require about the same commitment but I'm not sure about the content. Although I can audit the classes for free to get a feel of the content, I'd like to know if anyone has done both programs (udacity and MS) and could tell me the differences or if one is much better than the other.

I started teaching myself Python and data science practices a little over 2 years ago, and have *really* enjoyed it. I have enough freedom in my role that whenever I learn a new concept, I'm typically able to throw a project together that applies it. 

I went to my boss to discuss a promotion, and we both agreed I'm definitely overqualified for a Sr. Analyst role (or at least on the top-end of the roll). This lead me to bring up the idea that we create a Data Scientist roll for me, which he agreed to. I've been currently asked to create a job description for this new role, so my boss and I can pitch it to the decision makers in our department.

**Common trends I've seen on Data Scientist job descriptions:**

* Something around manipulating large data sets (cleaning/providing insights)
* Building/deploying algorithms to yield actionable &amp; accurate results
* Ability to explain models and findings clearly to key stakeholders
* Mentor and develop technical skills of analysts and senior analysts

I will keep it short and sweet but basically I am a young 21 yo male, no degree, currently in a leadership position in a growing startup. I have worked very hard in my time here and it has been recognized. With the changes constantly going on, tons of positions are opening up. However, being young I seriously have no clue what I want to do vs. what I can do.

A data-analyst position has opened and I have a very strong chance of getting into that field. The company would also assist with outside classes to help develop my skills which is a huge plus! Not the mention, the salary change would be life-changing for me especially at this age. I anticipate 50k living in a low cost of living area.

On one hand, I would love to take this opportunity because the skills I would learn would be very valuable and set me up to be marketable to other careers in the future. I would also be learning a TON which is a very good start to setting myself up. I've always loved picking up new things to try.

On the other hand, I am very conflicted because I have never been a 'numbers or data' guy, as I was more of a people person. Math was never my strong suite (however, statistics was very easy for me). I have been a computer/technical guy though and love technology. I have no doubt that I will be able to do this job, but I do wonder if I will be satisfied. It is also communicated that it will be a high-stress position.

I guess my question is, based off this information, would this be a good change for me?

I was thinking of as a first step letting Python work overnight, and just get the raw data from all the files and convert it into CSV (currently the files are so big because they are formatted XLSM files with graphs, macros, custom buttons etc).

And as a second step, after I have all these CSVs, I can directly access them and plot the data, because I think the individual files should take max few kBs it shouldn't be a problem.

TL;DR Need best advice on how to make this transition and what materials/programs you recommend. 

So I've been working in accounting for 5 years now. Graduated undergrad with a degree in it in 2013, got my CPA license, never really liked the work. For years I questioned my career path and searched for what I should really be doing with my life. A few months ago that search ended when I fell in love with data. One day a switch just flipped in my head and I knew that a career in data was where I belong. I'm constantly tracking and recording everything I do in my life (workouts, diet, spending, etc) and analyzing it. My favorite tasks in my accounting roles were the times I was able to do analytical work rather than just debits and credits. A few weeks ago I decided I didn't want to half ass the prep work to get to where I want to be and quit my job.  

So that's a little about my background and how I ended up posting here. At the present I know little to no programming. I bought Datacamp and have been running through the Python skill track the past few days. Does anybody have any advice on how to best utilize my time to get my hard skills up to speed? I'm trying to obtain any entry level type data analyst position as soon as I can. I just want to get my feet wet in the professional world ASAP with the added bonus that I'll have a paycheck again haha. Specifically any feedback on the following would be so much appreciated!:
  1) Do you recommend any other programs besides data camp? Not super in love with their teaching style. 
  2) Do you have any recommendations on how I should utilize my time? Should I just be concentrating on the coding as much as possible? Can I make this transition with no formal educational background?
  3) Do you recommend I apply for analyst jobs in parallel with learning this stuff? Or am I just wasting time applying until I'm relatively proficient with the language?

I may edit this post as other questions arise but I'm really just looking for advice or reassurance as to my plan for this transition before I absolutely immerse myself into learning. Any comments are welcome.  Thank you for being the best community on the internet!",1,1

So we hired a remote, hourly resource because we have no FTEs and even if we did, it wouldn't be funded to pay a data scientist and even if it was, anyone decent probably lives in a real city.  Anyway, my use case and data is as follows:

1) A set of meter consumption data.  Roughly 400 meters, with hourly readings going back roughly a year, so roughly 3.5M records.  

2) A listing of \~ 50 meters that failed efficiency tests; i.e., run 1000 gallons of water through the meter, and the meter registered 980 gallons, or 1020 gallons)  \[or more/less\].  Metadata on date of test and the efficiency rating measurements is included.  I have given him three reading values for meters that failed in the past, high efficiency, low efficiency, and an average of the two.  

3) Measurements at field testing time include a high flow efficiency ratios (i.e., a shit ton of water going through the meter) and low flow efficiency ratios (normal amount of water).  Unfortunately, in the consumption data, we only have a total consumption value; i.e., consumption is not broken down into high/low registers, even though this is how testing is performed.  

I tell this guy, look at the consumption records across the entire dataset, use the failing meters as training data set, write a model that can tell me which \*other\* meters are probable failures.   (The existing process for determination of failures is annual, manual inspection of each large commercial meter.  Very labor intensive and subject to extended periods of a meter reporting inappropriately.)

OK.  Anyway, the guy doesn't know the tools that I'd like him to have experience in, so I give him some time to come up on them.  But then, a few weeks in, I say, show me what you have and the shit just doesn't look like he's got half a clue.  So I say, convince me you've got a plan to attack this problem because I am not seeing it.  He sends this response:

&gt;The model with only one independent variable (i.e. AVG efficiency) is prone to underfit and will be biased  we may miss the relevant relations between features and our output variable. So first I will have to figure the ways to balance the bias-variance tradeoff in our use case. 

(?) OK, but I also gave him high and low efficiency reading values.  

&gt;Second, the consumption data is a tricky part here. There can be various scenarios that may cause the consumption data the way it is right now. For example, the resident can be out for vacation. Meter is installed in a store room etc. Additionally, Daily aggregation isnt a good idea here because it doesnt tell anything about the meters health, so I am trying out week level aggregation, month level and also quarterly level aggregation. I know that quarterly level aggregation would be too much but there is no harm in testing our hypothesis.  

I asked him to explain to a dumb ass like me why we would want to use daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation when we have hourly data available?  \[got no response\]  It seemed to me that we lose a lot of granularity of our data here, making it more problematic to identify changes.  (?)  Note:  These are commercial meters and I don't care about vacations and / or store rooms / they are all stored outside.  I have identified those meters that are irrigation (not too many of them).  I have rainfall data, but he hasn't asked for it.  

&gt;Our solution is going to use a classifier to distinguish between cases of legitimate, such as residents on vacation, and illegitimate, as malfunctioning or tampered, zero-consumption meters.

These meters aren't being tampered with, the people running them are businesses, and I have existing processes to determine zero consumption situations.  The whole point is to determine malfunctioning meters and if anyone out there is clever enough to tamper with a goddamn ultra-sonic water meter, I'm inclined to let them have water on general principle. 

Ultimately, I can't figure out if this guy has a clue or is just saying stuff to keep on submitting timesheets?  It would be one thing if he could tell me to have a field tech go test meters A/B/C/D/E and we could see how the efficiency ratings came back, but it feels like he's a ways off from being able to do that.  (?)

So let's say I have 12 samples of 250 individuals. I have 2 data points on them and the outcome of interest is a simple correlation between those 2 data points. This data is typically hard to collect on new samples. 

My main goal would be to use those 3000 data points to create a prior. The issue I am running into the prior I am interested in is the correlation between those two variables and correlations are an aggregate phenomenon. I was originally thinking I could use the prior observations to create a prior distribution and then would theoretically only need to collect 25-40 observations on a new sample and would be able to provide a probability that the two samples come from the same distribution. I kind of see this akin to A/B testing, with an A that is treated as almost equivalent to the true relationship and the B that is treated as the observed relationship.

Hoping someone can help.

I'm trying to look at loss aversion in world cup penalties shoot-outs. The book Thinking, Fast and Slow introduced the concept to me and it's that we'll work harder to avoid a loss than for the same gain. Shoot-outs have 5 rounds with one team winning a coin toss to kick first each round. If loss aversion is happening I expect the team kicking second's accuracy to be affected by whether or not the first team scored their kick that round. I expect the second team to be worse at scoring after the first team misses as then they're kicking for a gain that round and not trying as hard.

I had to scrap the data set from Wikipedia ([available here](https://github.com/MarkMacArdle/World_Cup_Penalty_Shootouts/tree/master) if anyone else wants to use it). Analysing it I get the following outputs:

Probability of 2nd kick of round scoring after... 

1st kick of round scored: 71.6% (n=95 - 68 scored, 27 missed) 

1st kick of round missed: 65.8% (n=38 - 25 scored, 13 missed) 

The probabilities of the second kicks scoring are different depending on the outcome of the first kicks of the round (as I'd hoped). But how do I test that this difference is significant and not just noise?

Other info that might be useful is the probabilities of

1st kicks of rounds scored: 70.5% (n=146 - 103 scored, 43 missed) 

2nd kicks of round scoring: 69.9% (n=133 - 93 scored, 40 missed) ",11,3

I have been experimenting on Tensorflow.js for sometime , I would like to Share my Learnings with the Community.

We know that An increasing number of developers are using TensorFlow in their machine learning projects. In March this year, the TensorFlow team at Google announced the arrival of the much-awaited JavaScript framework, TensorFlow.js (which was previously called DeepLearn.js).

Now developers can build lightweight models and run them in the browser using JavaScript. Lets understand what the need was for the development of this framework.

## History

Before going to TensorFlow.js, I would like to start off with TensorFlow.

TensorFlow was developed in 2011 at Google as their propitiatory library for Machine learning/Deep learning applications at Google. This library was open sourced in 2015 under the Apache License.

TensorFlow is built in C++, which enables the code to execute at a very low level. TensorFlow has bindings to different language like Python, R, &amp; Java. This enables TensorFlow to be used in these languages.

So, the obvious question is: what about JavaScript?

Conventionally, in JavaScript, ML/DL was performed by using an API. An API was made using some framework, and the model was deployed at the server. The client sent a request using JavaScript to get results from the server.

[Client Server Architecture](https://i.redd.it/eduvenp2y7d11.png)

In 2017, a project called Deeplearn.js appeared, which aimed to enable ML/DL in JavaScript, without the API hassle.

But there were questions about speed. It was very well known that JavaScript code could not run on GPU. To solve this problem, WebGL was introduced. This is a browser interface to OpenGL. WebGL enabled the execution of JavaScript code on GPU.

In March 2018, the DeepLearn.js team got merged into the TensorFlow Team at Google and was renamed TensorFlow.js.

Watch the below video for further details:

## TensorFlow.js

Tensorflow.js provides two things:

* The CoreAPI, which deals with the low level code
* LayerAPI is built over the CoreAPI, and makes our lives easier by increasing the level of abstraction.

## Getting Started

There are two main ways to get TensorFlow.js in your project:

## 1. via &lt;script&gt;Tag

Add the following code to an HTML file:

    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;!-- Load TensorFlow.js --&gt;
        &lt;script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.12.0""&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          Hello
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

## 2. viaNPM

Add TensorFlow.js to your project using yarn or npm.

    yarn add @tensorflow/tfjs   
    npm install @tensorflow/tfjs    

In your main js file:

    import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';    

## CoreAPI

## 1. Tensors

So, what is a Tensor?

[Visual Representation of Scalar,Vector,Matrix and Tensor](https://i.redd.it/qex3nvv5y7d11.jpg)

A scalar is a single number. For example, x = 1

* A vector is an array of numbers. For example, *x*=\[1,2\]
* A matrix is a 2-D array =&gt; (\[\[1, 2\],\[3, 4\],\[5, 6\]\])
* A tensor is a \*n-\*dimensional array with *n*\&gt;2

TensorFlow.js has utility functions for common cases like Scalar, 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D tensors, as well a number of functions to initialize tensors in ways useful for machine learning.

## Code Examples

**tf.tensor():**

    // Pass an array of values to create a vector.  
      tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]).print();   

**tf.scalar():**

    tf.scalar(3.14).print();    

And so on

Watch the Below Video to get a deep insight into Tensors in TensorFlow.js:

[https://youtu.be/sZrwxnIfHCo](https://youtu.be/sZrwxnIfHCo)

## 2. Variables &amp; Operations

Tensors are immutable data structures. That means their values cant be changed once they are set.

However, tf.variable()is introduced in TensorFlow.js. The real use case for tf.variable()is when we need to change the data frequently, such as when adjusting model weights in Machine Learning.

Code sample:

    const x = tf.variable(tf.tensor([1, 2, 3]));  
    x.assign(tf.tensor([4, 5, 6]));   
    x.print();    

## Operations

There are various operations in TensorFlow.js. In order to perform mathematical computation on Tensors, we use operations. Tensors are immutable, so all operations always return new Tensors and never modify input Tensors. So tf.variable()can be used in order to save memory.

Lets look into some operations:

**tf.add()Adds two** [**tf.Tensor**](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#class:Tensor)**s element-wise**

    const a = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3, 4]);   
    const b = tf.tensor1d([10, 20, 30, 40]); 
    a.add(b).print();  // or tf.add(a, b)    

There are many operations in TensorFlow.js. You can check the [documentation](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#Operations)for other operations. I will demonstrate one more operation here: **tf.matmul()**

**tf.matmul()Computes the dot product of two matrices, A \* B.**

    const a = tf.tensor2d([1, 2], [1, 2]);    
    const b = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2]);  
     a.matMul(b).print();  // or tf.matMul(a, b)    

Watch the below video for deep insight into Variable and Operations:

## 3. Memory Management

Memory management is the key in Machine Learning/Deep Learning tasks, because they are generally computationally expensive.

TensorFlow.js provides two major ways to manage memory:

1. tf.dispose()
2. tf.tidy()

They both typically do the same thing, but they do it in different ways.

## tf.tidy()

This executes the provided function function and after it is executed, cleans up all intermediate tensors allocated by function except those returned by function.

tf.tidy() helps avoid memory leaks. In general, it wraps calls to operations in [tf.tidy()](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#tidy) for automatic memory cleanup.

Code example:

    const y = tf.tidy(() =&gt; {
        // aa, b, and two will be cleaned up when the tidy ends.
    
        const two= tf.scalar(2); 
        const aa = tf.scalar(2); 
        const b = aa.square();
    
        console.log('numTensors (in tidy): ' + tf.memory().numTensors);
    
        // The value returned inside the tidy function will return // through the tidy,     in this case to the variable y. 
    
        return b.add(two); 
    });
    
    console.log('numTensors (outside tidy): ' + tf.memory().numTensors); y.print();

# tf.dispose()

Disposes any [tf.Tensor](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#class:Tensor)s found within the mentioned object.

Code example:

    const two= tf.scalar(2);   
    two.dispose()    

## LayersAPI

Layers are the primary building block for constructing a ML/DL Model. Each layer will typically perform some computation to transform its input to its output. Under the hood, every layer uses the CoreAPI of Tensorflow.js.

Layers will automatically take care of creating and initializing the various internal variables/weights they need to function. So, basically it makes life easier by increasing the level of abstraction.

We will make a simple example feed forward network using the LayerAPI. The Feed Forward network we will build is as below:

    const model = tf.sequential();
    
    //config for layer
    const config_hidden = {
      inputShape:[3],
      activation:'sigmoid',
      units:4
    }
    const config_output={
      units:2,
      activation:'sigmoid'
    }
    
    //defining the hidden and output layer
    const hidden = tf.layers.dense(config_hidden);
    const output = tf.layers.dense(config_output);
    
    //adding layers to model
    model.add(hidden);
    model.add(output);
    
    //define an optimizer
    const optimize=tf.train.sgd(0.1);
    
    //config for model
    const config={
    optimizer:optimize,
    loss:'meanSquaredError'
    }
    
    //compiling the model
    model.compile(config);
    
    console.log('Model Successfully Compiled');
    
    //Dummy training data
    const x_train = tf.tensor([
      [0.1,0.5,0.1],
      [0.9,0.3,0.4],
      [0.4,0.5,0.5],
      [0.7,0.1,0.9]
    ])
    
    //Dummy training labels
    const y_train = tf.tensor([
      [0.2,0.8],
      [0.9,0.10],
      [0.4,0.6],
      [0.5,0.5]
    ])
    
    //Dummy testing data
    const x_test = tf.tensor([
      [0.9,0.1,0.5]
    ])
    
    train_data().then(function(){
      console.log('Training is Complete');
      console.log('Predictions :');
      model.predict(x_test).print();
    })
    
    async function train_data(){
      for(let i=0;i&lt;10;i++){
      const res = await model.fit(x_train,y_train,epoch=1000,batch_size=10);
       console.log(res.history.loss[0]);
      }
    }

## My take onthis

This is excellent for coders who are familiar with JavaScript and are trying to find their way in the ML/DL world!

It makes things a lot simpler for people coming from a non-ML/DL background, but who are looking to understand this field. The use cases for this are many, and I personally think its something we need at the moment.

What do you think about TensorFlow.js? Let me know in the comments section below.
