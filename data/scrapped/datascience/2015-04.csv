Undergraduate major was in the liberal arts. After law school I found a job at that law school with a professor. I work as a research assistant, helping him out with his major projects. Most of my work is researching court documents, books, etc. And then I enter pertinent data into Filemaker, which is the program that is used here.
Over the time I've been here, I've become more interested in technology, specifically data science. Much more so than law, anyways. I'm looking to transition into the burgeoning area of ""data science"". Lately I've been using online courses to learn Python and SQL, and want to continue to learn and improve my skills in this area. I'm also considering learning some Statistics and advanced math as well.
One thing I've read about is attempting to ""bring data science into your current job"". I think there may be room to do that by doing more analysis work on the research I do and the data I get from that. But I also want to create a backup plan, and gain the right skillset to possibly land a job working with data if I can't get that type of work at my current position.

So, for those who are in starting out with data analytics can take these online courses.

1. Coursera: 
Coursera has a specialization in Data science and analytics course. This specialization is paid but the courses included in this specialization can be learned without paying anything. Yes, these courses are free and are available to be viewed online or downloaded to the computer. The courses will provide a person with non-technical background enough knowledge so that he can start in the data science business.

2. Udacity: 
Udacity similar to coursera is also offering a nano degree in data analytics. The udacity website says that people can easily land a job as a junior data analyst by opting for nano degree of data analyst. The udacity website works in the similar fashion as coursera website. Its data science courses are also freely available to users and can also be downloaded to the computer for offline learning.

3. Edx.org
Edx does not offer a degree or specialization in data science. Instead it has many courses for data science and analytics offered by popular universities. A user can take these MOOCs to get basic knowledge of data analytics.

Quick review: In summary, the course is a great investment if you want to take your understanding of these methods from a basic to an intermediate level. The course is fairly rigorous and requires a significant time investment. However, the focus on concepts and practical application allowed me to start applying techniques at the office immediately. I would have loved some more discussion on time series analysis but can't think of anything to take away...

After finishing grad school, I moved from academia (math) to industry. I work as a researcher/data scientist for a large, well-known tech company. I've stuck it out for about a year, but I'm increasingly unhappy with my position. However, I don't really know if what I'm experiencing is just par for the course, of if my position is abnormally bad.

I really like doing data science - exploring lots of data and making interesting and novel conclusions. I'm excited about using tools like Spark and Hadoop, and I love machine learning, especially the challenge of implementing algorithms on big data sets. I don't even mind gathering and cleaning data that much (in fact, sometimes it can be fun).

The problem is that I don't do much data science at my job. I spend 50-70% of the time in meetings with finance and business people explaining how what I'm doing works (they don't seem to trust the results just because the methods are not transparent to them). I get constantly shut down from doing exploratory projects because the business impact is unclear (i.e. I can't give the people I report to an estimate of the amount of savings the project would provide). I hardly ever get to dive deeper into interesting projects - when I get results for one project, I get handed a new, different project with high business value (read: big $$$ value).

I am struggling to understand what the best route would be, and where I will be happiest, and trying to integrate timing of getting a job in the data science field, and the current funding issues in high-energy physics. 

Just a quick overview of my background since I am thinking about the 5-10yr prospects of trying to get a professorship vs a career in data science...

I am currently about 1 year away from my PhD in theoretical particle astrophysics (specifically in phenomenology) at a good bay area university.  I have a strong computing background reaching back ~9 years in various settings.  For the past several years, I have used python for *all* of my work including the standard scientific stack as well as some experience with clustering and decision trees.  I currently have 8 publications (with 5-6 more over the next year), am fully funded by a national fellowship, and have ~10k lines of my own documented scientific python libraries which can be posted to github.  I also have a pretty strong collaborative network, and am pretty confident that I could get a decent postdoc position.

In addition to academics, I also have more industrial experience with a *very* small startup doing product development related to athletic timing systems (things like embedded microcontrollers, video compression, machine vision, a small smartphone app).  I came in there on the ground floor way back in high-school (ca. 2006?), but have continued to work with on the side, gaining 2 patents along the way.  I loved doing this type of work as much as my academic work, though I am looking for something more technical in the future.  

The reason for listing this is that I think I have a reasonably good shot at either field, but am concerned about going into the academic meat grinder; postdoctoral positions for 4 years, and then be unable to get a tenure track position (especially given the dramatic cuts to particle theory funding in the US).  I also love the West Coast and have a long term girlfriend who I don't want to make move every few years (the first few years would be ok). 

I also really enjoy programming, about as much as the science I work on itself.  Algorithms and computing have always been fascinating to me, as have faster paced/more dynamic jobs rather than working on the same thing for more than a few years.

My questions are the following:

1. Are those that were seriously considering academic pathways happy they left to a data science positions?  Are there any that took a postdoc and considered it somewhat of a waste of time? The route to professorship is just ridiculous these days.

2. If I were to take a postdoc for say, 2 years, would I be doing myself a disservice?  Right now seems like the best possible time to get a data science job, so I am wondering if e.g. starting salaries will be as high in 2-4 years since there are so many training programs popping up (dedicated masters), oriented at data science specifically.  Of course, I understand it won't be a saturated job market.

3. How do people feel about the tradeoff between creative freedom in academics vs. dictated projects. 

4. How do people feel about the tradeoff between scheduling freedom vs 9-to-5?  (I love being able to take time off whenever I want and make it up on the weekend or nights.)

5. Any other advice/considerations? 

Thanks!

**WHY I WANT TO DO THIS**
I work in the business of building entertainment apps.  These apps have anywhere from 100k-3m daily active users.  We record usage data via custom events with arbitrary data parameters we specify (events are ultimately sent in JSON format) and thus our sets are constantly evolving and are anything but static.  


I want to be able to from initial usage (i.e. first day or week) to be able to place a user into a segment for the purposes of sending them customized in-app offers and balancing and then do the same for our longer term users but with the goal of making them into whales (i.e. highly engaged big spenders)


**MY BACKGROUND**
I have a masters degree in an engineering field and have a pretty strong grasp of linear algebra, dif-e/q, multivariate calculus, line/surface/volume integrals, lagrangians, and college level conditional probability and statistics.  

I also am more or less a mid-level experienced programmer who is decent at variety of languages including python and can learn new languages easily enough.

I'm really rough on my probability and statistics though and lack any knowledge of number or set theory.


**WHAT SHOULD I LEARN**

I know there are a lot of topics regarding ""how to get into data science"" etc - with a lot of MOOC's suggested on Coursera, edx, etc.

My question is more geared for those who are going into graduate programs or even undergrad programs (e.g. Statistics, CS, Mathematics, etc.) and hope to become data scientists in the future. I know that data science is a very broad term, and nothing will top experience and practical experience.


My situation: I got a degree in Psychology, but really want to get into Data Science. I am going back to school this fall for an M.S. in Applied Statistics at a top university. While I wish I could've gotten into some of the new, top data science programs, I didn't have the grades for them, and so I'm trying to make the best out of what I have. My main question/concern: Which courses would be the most useful/practical for me if I am trying to become a data scientist? 


We all know programming is going critical (python, r, etc.), but what about statistics courses? Does it just vary by each job? For example, I'll be taking probability and statistical inference, applied regression analysis, which will all probably be useful. How about latent analysis, multivariate analysis, time series analysis, bayesian statistics, etc. (there are obviously many more to choose from)? How should I prioritize these? I'm trying to determine if I should substitute some of these for courses in the actual Data Science department (e.g. courses like Machine Learning for Data Science, Algorithms for Data Science, Applied Data Science)


What do you guys think? Any experienced data scientists have suggestions? Again, I understand that this degree or these courses won't land me a job; but I'm really just wondering which courses will help set a strongest foundation for me, and would make the best use of my time/money/resources at a graduate program.

I wanted to discuss this massive problem that I think currently exists on the internet. First of all, data is king. The amount of information that can be extracted from data will help this world in unimaginable ways. But there is shit load of unorganised data and a lot of effort is poured in understanding unorganised data and the companies who are successful as understanding this unorganised data use the for their benefit and not for the users.

Social networks data: like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ etc will use public data (posts, images, videos etc), understand the data just so that they can display ads to the user when this data can be used to answer these questions:
- Which one of my friends is selling something
- Which one of my friends is in need of help
- Which one of my friends has a job offer
- Which event are most of my friends going tonight to
- How did majority of my friends reviewed a product im searching for 
etc etc

All the major social networks can answer the above questions but they dont because they cant make money from it. Most of their focus seems to have gone to doing newer things like internet.org, self driving cars etc. When they can use what they currently have to make this world an even better place.

Shopping data- Big supermarkets, shopping centres dont want to give you digital receipts because they dont want you comparing their prices to other companies. When this data can help people save money and invest it in better things. We should be able to search contents of products by a quick web search to avoid buying anything that I might be allergic to but this does not exists.

Health data- We are still receive our medical reports in paper form which is making it difficult for us to analyse medical data to find cure for cancer, aids and other major diseases because of heavy government regulations. Doctors are never going to be as smart as machine learning algorithms.

I really want to discuss this matter and hopefully find a solution. Considering the amount of Software talent we have these days, we should all already have had Tony Stark like Artificial intelligence system in our homes :)",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Almost all analytics consulting/data sci jobs allow R, but many don't mention python or relegate it to a scripting language. Sometimes use of python could be implied under 'or other analytics environment'. 

I would be much obliged if anyone can help me with the below questions:

1. Are there more opportunities for r and is it a more marketable skill?

2. When a job lists R but not python as a requirement, can I apply with python and state I can use R through rpy2 if I need a package?

3. What sort of positions is each correlated with? 

4. If I'm interested in more consulting and less engineering like this (http://www.indeed.com/cmp/FactWorks-LLC/jobs/Junior-Research-Consultant-cfe73b1293c29316) , should I go with R, even though I have found a need for a scripting language to automate stuff around the office?

So, my data set consists of temperature data on the outside of the vessel and temperature data on the inside of the vessel.

Are there any tools or methods I can use to find the optimal offset when I go to write my temperature control algorithm?  I've attached a photo of a chart that I have so far: [Temp. Difference](http://imgur.com/n0oJpNp)

Both of them provide skillsets that are required for such a career, but it seems like without doing one, it would feel like I would be missing something.

In Systems Engineering, I get to learn basically about optimizing systems and most of the modules it touches on are more or less closely related to data analytics. The course also provides modules that are domain-focused, such as water resource management and urban transport systems optimization. Another good thing about the course is that I get to be closer to the industries than if I take on CS. 

On the other hand, there's Computer Science. If I take SE, I'll be missing out on improving the robustness of my CS abilities, and it would mean that I would not likely be qualified ability-wise for a CS-heavy job. Not choosing CS would also mean that I'll be missing out on a lot of interesting CS topics, such as Databases and Security, which, in one way or another, are related to data science as well.

The dilemma is real tough nut to crack. Would really appreciate some advice on which path to choose. Right now my main focus is to build myself into someone who is capable of performing data science, while at the same time be able to pivot into programming-related industries if anything happens.

I'm looking for some assistance evaluating the predictive analytics functionality of IBM Watson Analytics for my blog. For background, I'm a Business Intelligence developer working with IBM's ""analytics"" tools at the enterprise level. I run a blog on the side for fun that provides information for IBM Cognos developers and also tracks developments in the BI/analytics industry in general.

I'm currently reviewing Watson Analytics and am hoping people here would be interested in providing some feedback from the perspective of a data scientist, which I am most certainly not. Watson Analytics is free to use and - in my experience - IBM does not pester you after you sign up. No promises though.

If anyone is interested reply here or PM me. You won't be on the hook for much, just a blurb detailing your opinion of what the tool offers.

Here's the blog for reference: [IBM Blueview](http://ibmblueview.com)

Thanks!

EDIT: I should add, I don't have ads on the site, get link sponsorship or attempt to make money in any way. This is strictly for fun.

Basically, a lot of the stuff that you might call ""data science"" these days. Lately I've been interested in these steps as a process, and have been chatting with some folks in industry, ""data consulting"", and management. I'm trying to learn more about the process of data-driven projects, but am coming up short on clear resources.

It seems like there's a lot of commonality across fields in terms of going from raw data -&gt; features -&gt; knowledge about the data -&gt; repeat, but I haven't found any good resources for managing this process from start to finish. Obviously there is no ""one right answer"" for this kind of thing, but I am reminded of the way that management consulting uses case studies to guide decision making. 

There is a fair amount of information about individual components of this process (e.g., machine learning tutorials out the wazoo, lots of stuff about using hadoop and distributed processing to scale up, etc), but I haven't seen anything that really treats the entire process as a holistic unit. As a result I feel that people often focus on the trees and miss the forest (e.g., obsessively learn about classification algorithms without really having an intuition for how/why to use them to learn something about the data).

Do you guys know of anything that talks about the holistic process of ""data-driven projects""? If not, how have you guys ""learned the trade"", so to speak? 

Off the top of my head, some things that I think might be important along these lines:

1. How to go from 0 knowledge to ""some"" knowledge as quickly as possible, especially when working with teams of varying skillsets and background information.
1. The feature generation / analysis + applied stats cycle
1. Data curation, cleaning, and filesystem organization
1. Using version control as a means of tracking progress, discussing issues, and documentation
1. Going from raw analyses to refined ""outputs""...aka, telling a compelling story from the analyses you've conducted.
1. Translating the language of analysis into the language of stakeholders in this process (who often don't have analytical skills)
1. Wrapping all this stuff up into some sort of iterative process
1. Balancing team skills and managing workflow / to-dos during the process.

I have been accepted to a graduate program (MSc Data Science &amp; Analytics) but am unsure as to whether I should do it, or not.

The reason being is that there is a graduate program (job!) in Data Science that appeals to me. I applied unsuccessfully 6 months ago, but I sort of blindly went into it as I had all the requirements needed to apply, so I said why not, and prepared the best I could. Feedback for not being successful was having a lack of knowledge of the position and the company (my fault, it being my first career job interview also didn't help!).

Since then I have pushed on with regards my passion for data science. I attended a few talks on the subject, have been reading &amp; researching lots on it online, and have slowly but surely (I've a pretty heavy college/extra curricular schedule) been learning about areas of data science outside the scope of my course (Python programming, Machine Learning, Databases etc.), so I have a much stronger grasp of the job requirements and data science in general.

I've spoken to the company about this, and they are willing to give me another interview now. They also said that they'd be happy to give me an interview in 6 months if I decide to do the masters program. Two members of my class (and another two with whom I share some modules with) have been offered positions with the company. (I gave them tips and all to help with their interviews, something I didn't have!)

I'm absolutely torn as to what I should do, and was hoping that you guys would maybe have some advice on the matter. The masters is reasonably priced in comparison to some masters programs elsewhere (7,000), so finances isn't a massive issue. Salary for the job is quite reasonable with good benefits. 

Should I do the masters? Or should I re-apply for the company?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I know its a little taboo to make a how do I get myself into Data Science post, but I have a particular situation that I couldnt find using the search bar/Google and I would like to gather some outside opinions. 

Ive just touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Data Science but its sparking my interest. 

Some background:

Im 22 years old and recently switched (24 credits completed) into a Bcomm, Major in Marketing from a B.A. Major in Communications (51 credits completed) with a CGPA of roughly 3.5/4.3. I spent a good portion of the last year focusing on learning web analytics (mostly Google Analytics) and Adwords, with about one year of company-based work experience in the field. What Ive found is that Im very interested in gathering, graphing and understanding, and reporting what the data means and am less interested in the actual marketing side of things (i.e. content marketing, copy, SEO, etc...). From what Ive read so far, data science is taking what I love about analytics and adding all sorts of levels to it  what first intrigued me is the idea of using statistical methods and programming to manipulate the data, love that. That being said, Ive only completed two marketing courses, with the rest being general Bcomm core courses (one being statistics, which I ended up loving), so if I were to switch programs to another in my faculty, I could easily catch up. The (most relevant) programs in my faculty that I could switch into are: Economics, Business Technology Management (see appendix A for sample courses), Supply Chain Management and Finance. Note that theres an option for a Business Intelligence minor, as well.

My questions for you guys are:

1. Do you think me switching programs would benefit me in the future? If so, do you recommend staying in a Bcomm or transferring to another faculty all together? And do you think me switching for the second time would hurt my chances in the future (be in employment or grad school)?

2.  Would my experience using Google Analytics be helpful to an employer/my skill set, or am I completely offbase with this? 

I am certainly not set on changing my career goals just yet, but I would like to know the opinions on others who have done so, already and those who know more than I do about this subject. I have complete faith that if I decide to take the plunge Ill be fully engaged and push myself to do all sorts of projects and online courses to make sure Im as ahead as can be, so thats not an issue to me, its more the thought of how far back Ill be, especially since Ive already switched programs. I should also note that I'm a big fan of computer software and the idea of coding (haven't had much experience, just basic HTML &amp; CSS) and am eager to test it out. Definitely a technophile. 

I welcome any comments, criticisms or tips regarding my situation and I want to thank you all in advance for helping me out.

And even that is not really any analytics or number crunching.  But I've gotten a strong interest in the field of Data Science.  In my spare time I've been learning Python and SQL, and also plan on studying some Statistics and R as well.  That being said, I'm not sure how much ""true"" data analysis work I'll be able to get at my job, so I want to position myself fora  new position.

I find that most (if not all) data science positions I see want a Masters or PhD, usually in a quantitative field.  I seem to see Math, CS, and/or Statistics listed the most.

As such, I'm wondering if a Masters in Statistics would be a good idea to try to get a foot in the door.

I want to continue to work full-time at my job, so I'm looking at online programs.  Texas A&amp;M has one that seems to be well-regarded, and Cal State Fullerton has one as well (I'm in CA so would be pretty affordable for me).

The reason I'm looking at Statistics specifically is because I don't have a quantitative UG degree (History major), and the Stats programs I see seem to have the least amount of prereqs.  Usually I see a 3 semester sequence of Calculus (I've done 2 semesters back in college), a Stats course (I did Stats 101) and Linear Algebra.  In addition, Statistics just interests me more than pure math.

According to Twitter exec Krista Bessinger, ""Nasdaq hosts and manages our IR website, and we explicitly instructed them not to release our results until after the market close and only upon our specific instructions, which is consistent with prior quarters.""

Maybe my question should have been what are your thoughts on Data Science exposing human error?

I tried searching around the sub-reddit for something like this, but couldn't find anything in particular.

I'm finding some conflicting info regarding qualifications/job searching results around the web. I've read some stories where people with very reputable Master's degrees(some even with PhD's) in quantitative fields (stats, math, comp sci) with a few years of relevant experience who claim they can't get a job.

Then, there are some who will claim if you have a strong foundation, maybe an advanced degree, and get a couple years of relevant internships/positions, you should be set to make your way into the field.

For those who have gone through the process, what do you think is reasonable to expect for those who are trying to get into the field? Also, I'm wondering what is meant by ""Entry Level"" data science positions. Are we talking actual positions titled data scientist, and if so, I don't seem to see many of these positions that are entry level. Or are we maybe talking positions like ""quantitative analyst"" or ""data analyst""

Obviously there is no formula. A degree from X university and 3 years on your resume won't give you a data scientist job at some great company, and countless other factors (connections, interview skills, etc.). But I'm just wondering what some people's experiences might have been like. Let me know what you guys think!


(My story: Getting a Master's in Applied Stats at a very reputable university this year; not much professional experience but will try to get a good internship this year; have just begun learning python)

tldr: What should new graduates/career-changers expect when trying to get into the data science job market? ",9,8,False,self,,,,,
