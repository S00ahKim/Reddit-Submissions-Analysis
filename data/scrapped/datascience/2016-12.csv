I currently have a BS in Environmental Science, and a Master of Business in Science in Environmental also, both from Rutgers.

I've figured I'm so behind everyone who is studying data science, I wanted to go for a bachelors, but it seems all I find are Masters programs, including my program at RU. **Am I searching the right term? I can't seem to just get a solid Data Science degree result back.** 

Additionally, if this is mainly a masters degree, am I as far behind as I think? I don't know any programming languages. I have one semester of mathematics (Calc 2).

Lastly, is there a big skill gap/differentiation between data analytics and data science? I'm looking at the median salary, and there is a gap of about $40K. Can I get a Data Scientist position with an analytics degree? The Rutgers MBS seems to have a hybrid Data Science/ Analytics course. I'm wondering if employers will consider me or dismiss me immediately, depending on if I get an anlaytics or a science degree. This is the Data Science/ Analytics degree I am referring to: http://www.mbs.rutgers.edu/programs/analytics-data-science-hybridonline

Anyway, my current system is a custom built PC which uses Windows as its OS. However, at 5 years old, it seems to be running on its last legs and I'm starting to think about my next purchase. The primary consideration as of now is which operating system, so I'm curious as to the /r/datascience community's opinions. 

With the little experience I have, it's my understanding programming runs a bit smoother on a Mac since it's UNIX-based. I've noticed some subtle complications I had to use a workaround to accommodate that students using a Mac didn't experience. Additionally, it seems to be the consensus among professionals, my professors, and fellow students. My main issue with Apple is the lack of ability to build or customize your own PC. I'm also reluctant to submit to their pricing and business model out of principle (planned obsolescence). In a nutshell, their products seem to be sacrificing customer experience to allow greater profits (addons). 
The second option is Windows which is what I'm used to. The main benefit I see is the ability to build and customize your PC. Additionally, there are more Windows users than Mac users so you perhaps less cross compatibility issues? Though I suspect in the field of Data Science, the opposite is true. What I see as particularly troubling is Microsoft's increasing intrusiveness in regards to our data and relentless pushing of their products (looking at you Edge) and constant updates. Also, I'm most familiar with the OS so I may be doing myself a disservice by limiting my exposure. 

Lastly, I'm considering Linux. I get the best of both worlds, can build and customize your PC, operate under a UNIX-like OS, and it's all for free. Additionally, my hope is that using a Linux system would inherently increase my understanding of programming fundamentals. My main concern here is the lack of compatibility for many programs. I know there's workarounds such as WineHQ though that's partially the issue with Windows, and it'd be for general computing rather than programming. I heard one of my professors state they had to get a Mac after having a Linux to access our 'Virtual Classroom'. 
To get a better idea of what I currently do; I primarily will be using Python &amp; R. My plan is to specialize in Machine Learning and Data Visualization though that could change as I advance. Outside of that, I just browse the web and watch movies  nothing too exciting. I do have (2) monitors and a TV connected, I'm not sure if that is an issue on either the Mac of Linux OS.
 
**TLDR**: What operating system do you prefer for your personal or work life, and why?",4,2

From what I read, it's possible to secure an entry level job as a data analyst (usually in marketing) with nothing more than a college degree and a good portfolio. 

I've been studying on my own for the past 2 years and I think I'm ready to make this portfolio. I'm planning on making a website that gives a report alongside all my code and data for each project. I already have a couple Kaggle projects under my belt. Are these something I could put in a portfolio? I also have some personal ideas such as Personanexus, a tool to find parallels between different fictional characters and different personality types. Would it ever be okay to use data in my projects that I not only curate, but generate personally by hand? I have another idea to simply utilize an existing GAN tool to make my own text-to-image pictures, basically demonstrating that I understand how to use advanced libraries. Is using other people's obscure tools enough or should I just stick with more mainstream tools for my portfolio projects?

In my About Me section, should I say all the online courses I completed? Because I have pretty much no relevant college course work. How honest should I be about my situation of not having a serious job for the past 6 years? Can anyone recommend me some sample data science portfolio sites to look at?

I have a Masters in Env Sci, but after working for 3-4 years in environmental consulting, I don't think it is for me.

I'm looking in to data sciences, and it seems the most feasible option for me is to join a boot camp. I'm willing to quit my job immediately to take advantage of this opportunity, but I'm very weary of how employers view 12 week boot camps. However, I do hear that these boot camps often help you seek out employers.


I'm interested in doing boot camps in which you really get to work on a lot of projects which I can describe in my resume.",10,0

I have an assignment using Weka at my college. I am supposed to analyze a dataset, visualize it and then pick up on some patterns etc. The problem I'm having right now is that apart from clicking the visualize tab and describing what I see I don't really know how to do anything meaningful visually. I'm currently going through this tutorial so I'm hoping that it teaches me to do something decent. Apart from a decision tree and looking at the visualize tab is there much else I can do?

Secondly, I can't find any suitable datasets apart from the ones already packaged with Weka. I researched online and it said that Weka was capable of opening .csv files however I'm not having great luck doing it with the arffviewer. The only luck I had was when opening a lung cancer dataset and the attribute headers were just A62873824 or something similar so I assume it would only be readable by someone in the medical field. All the other CSV files just don't work. When I open them with Excel they don't seem like they're in a good file format for Weka with multiple colons and commas etc in each cell. It would be a nightmare to reformat it I think.

I'm sorry this question is a bit all over the place but I'm getting quite desperate now. Are there any decent datasets out there for Weka? Am I doing something wrong with the .csv files? Is it possible that I could actually create my own .arff files easily and use them?

Thanks for any help.

EDIT: Okay, I managed to find a few new datasets on a mysterious looking website. I'm trying to load a graph visualizer in Weka however and it's getting stuck on ""removing gaps by adding dummy vertices"" with the console output being: 

    Error. Expected graph or digraph at line 1

**Backstory**

I'm currently unemployed data analyst/scientist which is lost in a flood of information in Internet and can't choose what to study next. I started as a technical worker in an IT company, but through the course of my work I started to develop tools for myself to give me better understanding of the feedback from our users and how our actions affect them. This was noticed by my boss and soon I started to work as data analyst. After some time I started to get tasks not only to analyze data, but also to try to apply ML algorithms and get ""some results"", if possible. I became quiet good at cleaning and processing data, learned myself a lot of python/pandas, so it was kind of a natural way to grow further in data science. I've been given tasks to read a paper and apply ""this algo"" on the data and measure the efficiency. While it was interesting,  I was learning on-the-go and didn't have a chance to get a systematic knowledge in data science: one task done, here's another one. Other tasks were to try some different approaches about data: ""let's not do regressions, let's do knowledge graphs"", so I set the backend up and tested it with our data.

I ended up with the following skills(some are better than others):

* python, pandas

* data cleaning

* data visualization(matplotlib, d3.js)

* some algorithms(linear/logistic regressions, naive bayes, DBSCAN)

* some metrics(HVDM along with ""standart"" ones)

* running jobs on hadoop clusters

That being said, not everyone knows HVDM, but I do, but on the other hand I lack a lot of simple knowledge about number distributions and their properties etc etc. After I left my job I started applying to positions and going to interviews and realized how f*cked up I am: I do have some valueable knowledge and experience, but it's so chaotic...

I decided to improve. **And here it comes...**

**Brain starts to f*ck me over**

* ""Hey, al, we need foundation first, so let's go over [this set of articles on math](https://betterexplained.com/archives/) to understand algorithms better""

* ""You know, al, I've reconsidered, let's start with [those](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorials/) awesome tutorials: we will implement algorithms in python and learn how they work""

* ""Damn, maybe we should start [this](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) specialization on Coursera, looks good!""

* ""Wait, I just realized smth, al! You don't know how to choose metrics! Let's find info on that!""

* ""The interviewer mentioned bloom filters and some other sick data structures, learn this!""

* ""Goddamit, al, you wanted to learn Clojure for so long, use [those](https://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Data-Science-Henry-Garner/dp/1784397180/) [books](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Clojure-Data-Analysis-Rochester/dp/1783284137/)""

* ""NO! Let's start with [some books](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do), that overview the whole field of data science!""

* ""Hm.... I read in some blog that they have tidyverse, maybe it's time to [learn some R](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)?""

* ""F*ck math, let's practice: go to [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/), then head to Kaggle and own them all!""

* ""ALARM! Everyone wants someone with experience with Spark, go learn Spark!""

Result? There is none.

In the end I became paralyzed by [paradox of choice](http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice).

**To sum it up**

I still don't know which metrics are better to apply in which case. I don't know about which algorithms are preferrable given a task. Different distributions and their properties: is that even important? I'm not a jack of all trades, rather a king of none. And I'm lost. But I **want** to understand.

**My questions**

1. Where do I start? All those things I mentioned are important.

2. How to better combine theory and practice?

3. What path did you have? Will you recommend it?

4. What books/courses/whatever will you recommend?

5. What's the natural progression to grow as data scientist?

1) I'd like to ignore the outliers, so the points which come from special public transport courses (probably due to blocked roads). To do it I plan to count the number of close points for each point and if it's below N, remove it. Is this the right approach? Any other ideas?

2) About the polyline:

One simple idea would be to take sample of points and just connect them. I'd probably need to do it not randomly, to make sure chosen points are not too close to each other. How do I know in which order should I connect them? Minimize lines length?

Do you have any other ideas? There has to be something more clever and it'd be great if someone would point me in right direction. I'm really interested if it's possible to do it only having coordinates, but it's possible for me to get sequences of points (single routes). How could it be done then?

Thanks a lot for any help :)",12,13

I bet you get a lot of questions along these lines here, so I hope by giving some specifics I can make it less repetitive.  I would very much appreciate any advice or thoughts you can give me.  I'm seriously considering transitioning into the data-science field.  I think I have some of the skills, but there are obviously many that are missing, and I'm trying to make a plan as to how to acquire them.

**Experience/skills I have:**

1. A PhD in computational physics.  Completed 10 years ago, so possibly somewhat rusty.  Basic (but by no means amazing) programming skills in Fortran (yes, really) and C acquired in connection with same.  But solid experience with analyzing data. 

2. Very (very) basic familiarity with Python.

3. Intermediate knowledge of statistics.  (Acquired in connection with PhD and in some unrelated subsequent work.)  By ""intermediate"" I mean I could probably tutor college-level psychology students in statistics, but could not do same to statistics students. And I'm not really familiar with any non-standard techniques or current statistical literature. 

4. Can do a lot in Excel, but have not learned to use VBA. 

**Skills I know I am lacking:**

5. Building and use of databases. 

6. Higher-level knowledge of statistics.  (Not sure what, though.) 

7. Use of statistical programming tools.  (I know what Stata and R are, but have never used them.)

8. Relevant programming languages.  (I'm not even sure what those would be considered to be.)

9. Actual fluency in any programming language.

**Questions**

A. Am I right that I need to acquire the skills listed as lacking above?  Any advice on how to approach this?  (Specific courses, exercises, books, or just general advice all very welcome.)

B. What else do I need to learn to make this work?

So far I'm thinking I should (1) just start doing stuff in Python, to get more fluent in it; (2) learn R; (3) learn SQL (?).  Then, when I have the technical side down (or more down than I do now), do some course in data visualization, to learn more about ways to present data.  Do those steps sound right?   Do I need additional statistics courses?  Programming languages?

(For context: I'm in my mid-30s, in NYC.  Several years of work experience in an entirely unrelated field.  I'd have no problem paying tuition for worthwhile online or in-person courses, etc.) ",29,8

As part of this, I collected news headlines data from NY Times to do a sentiment analysis if the news on the day is pro-democrat or pro-republican.

Data looks like this:

20150801,Mrs. Clinton sought to position herself as a forward-looking alternative to Republican supporters of the economic blockade.
20150802,Will the vice president jump in the race for the Democrats? Will Howard Schultz?

Date and headline.

Now, I want to classify data into 2 spectrums, pro-democrat or pro-republican.

In nltk packages, we have packages that do a positive/negative analysis but how can I do this for my objective.

I want to apply clustering over the dataset but just wanted to check if there are any better ways of doing things.

I could also synthesize a train dataset with a label for each category and train the model. Any inputs ll be greatly appreciated!!

Could anyone highly recommend online training in any of the following areas?:

Data Modeling (including SQL/Teradata use)
Data Visualization (such as Tableau, Spotfire, etc.)
Data Mining (particularly related to algorithms -- I never had much development there)
Anything related to statistics, coding, or any other topics you find to be pertinent.

Ideally, these would be offered at an intermediate-ish skill level.  Certification is preferred, as it offers greater justification as to why the training is worthwhile, but it is not required.

(This is just a rough outline -- any advice/courses you can offer at all related to data science would be appreciated!)

Im about to finish my research master in social and organizational psychology and Im really interested in working at the intersection of datascience, (social) psychology and marketing.

What bothers me about my field is that there is a HUGE amount of real time data that we could use to learn about human behaviour, but were not using it. Psychologists basically still invite 100 students to their labs, do an experiment and then spent the rest of the year trying to get that published, while nobody has use for their results. I decided that this approach is not for me.

In my degree, I learned inferential statistics (ANOVA, Multiple Regression, GLM, multivariate regression and some non-parametric techniques) and I can do these kinds of analyses in SPSS and R. We also learned about survey construction, causal inference, and experimental designs and of course how to interpret results. As a ""bonus"" I also probably now more about the psychological theories that explain human behaviour, which might help in some circumstances.

What Im clearly lacking are skills in programming, machine learning and database management, which I hope to acquire now so that I can work my way  up from internships/traineeships.

Regarding this, I have some questions that some of you might be able to answer:

- would you say that with my background it is even worth to apply to data-science internships? A friend of mine pulled it off but he also had programming as a hobby for a long time, so Im not sure whether this is a viable way in?

- Is Python a good programming language to start with or would something more specific like SQL be more useful? I found this online course that sounds pretty good, maybe sombody here took it and has an opinion? (https://www.datacamp.com/getting-started?step=2&amp;track=python)

- Most basic courses like ""Intro to Datascience"" seem to basic for me (with entire lectures devoted to ""How to install R studio"" and ""making barplots""). Are you aware of any courses directed at people with medium knowledge of R that have never done ML or worked with BigData before?

- If you have any other advice, resources or tips, Im all ears!

442,2016-12-10,2016,12,10,8,5hh2g9,Couple of follow-up questions re: filling skill gaps. Python and DataQuest.io.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5hh2g9/couple_of_followup_questions_re_filling_skill/,RestlessPistaccio,1481325859,"I received some fantastic advice [earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5gjt7k/how_do_i_fill_my_skill_gaps/), including from /u/froggyenterprisesltd, /u/nwcrc, /u/Amare_NA, /u/slinkystraightened, and /u/beegreen.  My current tentative plan is first to spend a few months studying up, then (if the studying hasn't changed my mind by then) apply for the Insight Data Science program and maybe similar programs.  (Depending on how the studying goes, I may have to wait longer to apply.  Or apply and fail, then continue to study and apply again later.) 

Anyway, a few follow-up questions: 

1. I've started doing some courses at DataQuest.io, which so far has been very good.  Has anyone here done their entire Data Science path?  It seems to have all that I was looking for (more advanced Python than I have, use of APIs, basic SQL and machine learning, data cleaning, a bit of R, and some peripheral stuff like Github and Jupyter).  As I said, so far it looks good, but I'd be curious to hear what others thought of the full course.  For one thing, the site doesn't give any estimate as to the number of hours/days/weeks the course is expected to take.  Recognizing that this will vary widely, it would be helpful to know if it's intended to take about 100 hours or more like 2,000 hours.  

2. DataQuest recommends use of Python 3.5.2.  Past courses I've taken (in the last year or two) have said to stick with 2.7, arguing (if I recall correctly) that versions 3 and up are not widely used and quite different.  Any thoughts on this?",17,8

I have a general question about graduate school that the search bar didn't help me with, probably because I have a tad of a different situation.

I'm enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. I have a BA, it's meh, I figured out about 90% through I wasn't getting a ton out of it, but I finished it because I was 90% done (the AF will only pay for so much schooling after all). I am currently pursuing an MA in Emergency Management, and 4 out of 10 classes in, I'm feeling like I'm not getting a ton out of it. I have to take a break to do some mandatory training for the AF, and I'm taking the opportunity to explore possibly switching my course of study before I end up with another a degree I don't give two shits about.

As I stated, my MA program is Emergency Management, and one of the classes I had to take was Applied Data Analysis in Criminal Justice, and something I discovered was that I really enjoyed crunching numbers. Also, in my job, I've recently been tasked with crunching huge numbers, and it's sort of satisfying. I may have accidentally found something I like. 

So I'm seriously considering switching my major before I'm too far down this rabbit hole. Unfortunately, I'm finding a ton of ""best of"" lists that all feel like advertisements, both for the schools and the specific MS that they're offering. My question for you, DataScienceit, is which degree programs and/or universities should I be looking at if I just really enjoy crunching numbers?

I read in another thread here that a specific ""data science"" degree may not be that helpful since it seems to be a flavor of the month type degree, but maybe something like data analytics or statistics? It doesn't have to be something specific, because as I said, I'm in the military, they don't care what degree I get. I'm at Arizona State online now, and I'm not unwilling to apply to a new school, because I'd rather study something I like. 

If I'm in the wrong spot, please point me toward a sub or a Google search magic phrase where I can find unbiased information for someone who just really wants to study stats, numbers, data crunching, whatever!

Thanks everybody!!!",4,2

So what kind of job should i get to make a future transition to data scientist?

  The options are programmer, since i already have some skills in Python, Java and other languages;- dba , i know a little bit of sql and mongoDb , could get a certification if necessary;- webdesigner, my own website is coming soon and i have  a couple of freelancing clients

I need to process millions of web events - clicks, views, time-spent in real time (maximum 10 minutes delay).

I'm using rabbitmq and python to do the job. However, I'm a bit worried that my solution might not be scalable and of professional standard.

Please tell me what you think of my solution. 

Thanks.

---

1. My php web server received web events, and then they are put into rabbitmq queue. 
2. I have python consumers which basically aggregate stats like total views on a web page. The consumers just grab messages from rabbitmq queue in batch, and then update the total stats to the final postgre database. Then delete the processed messages from rabbitmq. Consumers are run in supervisor and they keep checking the queue if there were any messages. If not, they will sleep for 30 seconds before checking again.
3. I have a watchdog process that looks out for number of messages on the queue and expand the consumers based on the number of messages.

What do you think of this solutions? Am I supposed to be looking at better open sources solutions such as twitter storm or hadoop? Will my current solution be able to handle 5 millions events a day?

I am looking for a data science masters in Europe that is also low tuition for non-europeans. 

A little background:

I did a bachelors in biology(in US) and I am now finishing up my Masters in Bioinformatics(in Belgium). It was very machine learning and statistics heavy from a theoretical perspective but we only had 3 programming courses and the thesis which is programmed. I feel due to my non-mathematical/programmatical bachelors I lack a lot of the intuition that those people have. 

Given my background I think I can do well in a second masters. On paper I look good (internships/theoretically learned most data science concepts/ML based thesis) and I could probably get a job back home (US) but I think they will expect more than I can deliver given the coursework we had since even my class called ""Database management"" was 90% theory. 

I do not have a country of preference only that it is cheap and taught in english.

This is a list of programs I have found(fitting my criteria), just making sure I don't miss any: 

* [LMU](http://www.m-datascience.mathematik-informatik-statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) - Perfect but competative 
* [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/education-and-training/master-data-science/profile/) - This is a little too CS heavy for my background according to the course list. ",34,15

It can be used on several input formats right now: .csv, .tsv, .hdf5, .xlsx, .json.

You can clone/fork the [repository on github](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata)
or you can just [get the script itself](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saulpw/visidata/master/bin/vd) and run it. 

On the surface, it feels like a text-mode spreadsheet (like oleo).
But it has some fundamental differences:

   - it's [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) compatible, so most actions only operate on whole columns or batches of rows
   - columns are type-aware, and can be converted to int/float/date with a single keystroke. Two keystrokes will autodetect the types of all columns ('g~').
   - operations are more for ease of exploration, discovery, transformation, than for analysis and visualization (but it does have a histogram that can be called up on any column with a single keystroke)
   - it can also browse any python objects, lists, and dicts, and allow the user to rearrange and edit their members
   - help, options, and meta-sheets are all available as regular sheets themselves
   - all sheets can be filtered, sorted, transformed, and joined together by matching key columns

It's currently at v0.37, which is the most feature complete and stable version so far.
This is correspondingly about 37% of what I am planning on doing for version 1.0 (see the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/develop/ROADMAP) ).

Right now it's a 1600 line script with no basic dependencies other than Python3.3 (although opening formats like .hdf5 and .xlsx will need the h5py and openxlsx modules, respectively), which was a refreshing rebellion after 20 years of 'best practices' that I've preached as well as performed.
I think it's cool that I can just wget a single script and get straight to work on a remote server, but I also admit it's getting past the prototype stage and could use some more rigor.
So I'll probably embark on breaking it up and properly arranging the codebase next.
But that will be a bit of effort, and things may be broken for a little while.
In the meantime, I want to make sure there's a reasonable prototype demo available for people to play with.

So I would love it if a few people would spend 20 minutes playing with VisiData on some of their own data.
I'm curious if anyone else will be able to figure out how to join two sheets together.
Especially please tell me if the program ever quits unexpectedly, stops responding, if some action does not work, or it gives an error message.

And let me know what you think overall!  Particularly if you're a console user.  This is for us :)",2,11

How do I go about building a model that can handle this many 'categorical' variables, and predicting at an individualized level while also 'jointly' learning?  What approaches are possible? 

 For instance, I believe that tree learning techniques are not really valid due to the exponential increase in the number of splits that happen?

My dataset looks like this(~8k records):

20160701	A tone-deaf blunder creates more suspicion around Hillary Clintons email practices.
20160701	Acknowledging the challenges of finding a willing running mate, readers offer their picks and digs.
20160701	Much of the program remains up in the air, including who will speak, how and when Mr. Trump will arrive and what he will say when he does.
20160701	The move by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch would eliminate the possibility that a political appointee would overrule investigators.
20160701	A rally for the presumptive G.O.P. nominee suggests that crowds are reveling in their chance to get out from under the thumb of political correctness.
20160701	How Trump is smashing everything.
20160701	The sun never sets on a stupid idea. Britain is cracking up now because it followed the crackpots. The U.S. could make the same mistake.
20160701	The strategist, who once worked on Senator Rand Pauls presidential campaign, had been hired just a week ago to shore up an area where Mr. Trump lags.
20160701	The comment was reminiscent of the primary campaign, rather than the more disciplined approach Mr. Trump has sought to take in recent weeks.
20160701	Republicans said the airport encounter compromised the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails, but Ms. Lynch said the conversation did not touch on the inquiry.

I labeled myself a test data of upto 500 records and applied few classification models (Linear SVC, NB, Log. reg., RF) to classify entire dataset but the results are not that encouraging. 

My test dataset contains 50-50 share to each party but the final output from model has a huge difference in terms of 10X. Hoe can I improve the model.

I am trying to understand if there is any corpus to feed political sentiment/custom ways to build that into the model.

About me ( can skip) 
I am an economics student in my last year. Last year I had a statistical learning course where we worked through the whole elements of statistical learning. EVer since then I absolutely love Machine learning and Data science. 
I had 1 semester in LA 2 In Dif/Integ. Calculus and 4 semesters of Prop. Stat all UNI level. 

The question:

Does anyone know very advanced math videos epecially in the domain of linear algebra, Differential calculus and statistics which are about 10 minutes each? 
I am asking because I recently worked through all 3 Linear algebra Playlists of this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnfh8jNqBlg&amp;list=PLlXfTHzgMRUKXD88IdzS14F4NxAZudSmv
And now I am looking for: 

Even more in depth LA videos in the same format/ lecture style. 
Very advanced statsitcs videos in the same style (watched all ben lambert videos,  loved them too).
Or just general Prop. theory, complex analysis, etc videos in this style.

To be clear I don't like the 2 hours lecture style, there are plenty of ressources for that. And often I know half of the stuff and phase out, this is why I like this format because in every video just one idea, method, proof etc is explained.

This winter break I plan on building out my online portfolio with a few examples of exploratory data analysis. I wanted to read up on any resources the members here might have because right now my EDA process looks like:

1. Source/load data.

2. Clean up missing/weird values (can be a bit more involved sometimes, but generally light sanitation).

3. Get a feel for the data distribution itself. For different features of interest, look at population and aggregate distributions. Get some boxplots going. Maybe build out a model if I'm feeling adventurous.

4. 'Ooh, that's interesting! What if we split it this way...'. Generally doing some free-form but directed analysis.

5. Visualizing and communicating what I found.

6. Repeat (3) until done.

There are tons of books on my backlog, but I'd love to hear what resources you all might have in mind (preferably in R, but Python's fine too). Also: **how do you approach EDA?** Is it always with a particular intent, or is it sometimes free-form?

In May 2016, I graduated with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and a wealth of biomed research experience, including 6mos full-time work at a biotech company.  As it turns out, neither laboratory research or chemical manufacturing are really my cup of tea; however, from both experiences I have learned that I am very interested in data analysis and mathematical modeling.  My struggle to find a suitable career has led me here, and I believe data science may be where I belong.

Through Chemical Engineering, I have an understanding of multivariable calculus, differential equations, statistics, and process modeling.  From my understanding, each of these skills would be valuable in the realm of data science.  What I lack is computer programming experience.

With this in mind, if my interest in data science continues to develop as I research the field more, what masters/PhD programs should I be looking for?  Would it be difficult for me to break into a CS degree program without prior experience?  Are there programs out there for people like myself?

Please note: I do not have a PhD.  I am interested in identifying a suitable graduate program.",16,2

1. Does the interviewee get to use his/her own computer or does the company provide a machine for the duration of the challenge

2. I have written a bunch of scripts to clean / modify data. Can I use those (download it from my git repository to the company machine or use them on my own machine during the data challenge)?",11,10

I'm weighing my options right now of either entering the workforce or heading back to school. 

* I'm considering going back to school for a second bachelor's degree in either Data Science (https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/undergraduate/arts-sciences/data-science/major) or Computer Science (https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/undergraduate/arts-sciences/computer-science/major). I have also looked into the online post-bacc degree from Oregon State University. My long-term goal would be to attain an MS in Data Science (http://www.galvanizeu.com/curriculum). Recently, I've been learning to code in Python and have gotten pretty comfortable with it, as well brushing up on my quantitative skills. I understand both the financial and time investment I would have to undertake in pursuing a second bachelor's degree, but I feel like this may be the best ROI for the long-term. 

* I may have an internship lined up with a professional sports team to be an operations intern and am also considering going down the path of getting an MA in Sports Management (https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/sport-management). To me, this path doesn't scream security and is such a specific focus that it may end up being detrimental in the long-run if things don't work out. I'm passionate about sports and especially sports analytics, but I'm unsure that this choice would be as rewarding as pursuing a quantitative field.

My current situation is relatively free of personal expenses, and I want to be able to contribute to my family financially down the road as well when they are no longer providing for me. My parents aren't getting any younger, and for me to continue to live in San Francisco, I'm going to need to be able to financially support myself which is why I'm looking to pivot towards a more technical field. Be it either CS or DS with which I can utilize not only in the sports industry but also a broad array of other areas from economics to people analytics. Any advice, guidance, or personal experience would be very much appreciated. Thanks again.

The representative they spoke to was very adamant that I use Apache Spark (and then my firm purchase their product).

Here is the situation:

After pre-processing I'm working with a dataset that is ~4 GB large. Before preprocessing its closer to 7 GB.

From my understanding, using Spark  is only justifiable when analyzing data on the scale of terabytes. But I would like to confirm this knowledge here! I'm more statistician than developer so I tend to play catch-up when evaluating technologies.

I think running and optimizing Spark for ""small data"" makes sense when working with a development team. It seems keeping everything in a standard Spark Pipeline would make productizing models much easier. But this doesn't apply to my project.

Right now I've got RStudio server and Jupyter server running on their own dedicated separate ports of an AWS instance, so I can get to RStudio by visiting myserver:XXXX and Jupyter via myserver:YYYY.

This really only gets me partway to what I need. RStudio at least gives me an entry point to git and a rudimentary shell, but it's not a convenient environment for running python code. Jupyter is good for authoring notebooks, but if I want to build a more complex project than can conveniently be packed into a single notebook it doesn't do the job. Neither Jupyter not RStudio gives me sufficient filesystem access to use pip or conda to install new packages (maybe I just need to give the rstudio user execute access?). I'm thinking maybe Yhat Rodeo would be a better solution for python (can I even use rodeo like this? Or is it just a local IDE?), but I suspect I'm never going to be able to escape the need to SSH into the box to accomplish certain things.

I'm sure I'm not the only data scientist who wants this kind of environment, so I'm guessing there's probably some super polished solution I should probably be using that I'm just not aware of. If any of you have set something like this up or know of a good way to do it, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Bonus points if your solution let's you spin up and requisition additional RAM/CPU resources automatically tied to the environment from a browser-accessed interface. I'm guessing the solution here probably involves spark.

**TL;DR**: What I'm trying to accomplish looks something like this: 

&gt; Traveling out of town and didn't bring my computer. I borrow a friend's computer, visit my environment's URL, login and there's my environment. I pick up where I left off, set a task to run and continue my visit. Later on in my trip I visit my remote environment and see the task is still running, so I requisition additional processing power to speed things up. 

RStudio server gets me most of this, but I also want to be able to work with python.

**UPDATE**: A colleague turned me on to [Eclipse Che](https://eclipse.org/che/) which seems to be exactly what I was looking for. Instead of configuring and hosting an instance myself, I discovered https://codenvy.com/ which hosts Eclipse Che instances and has a 3GB free tier. Playing with it now and seems to be perfect, expecially since if I were hosting it myself I'd have to pay cash money for even 2 GB since my AWS free tier has long since expired.

Now I just need to learn eclipse :p. I'm a bit concerned that I might not be able to use python interactively in Che...",16,26

I'm an undergraduate operations research student, graduating next spring. In addition, I have a minor in computer science. Ever since enrolling at my university I have known that I want to work with mathematical/statistical modelling, machine learning and cloud computing. During my BSc studies I've learned plenty on optimization and statistics and have been content.

I live in Europe, and going for a Master's degree immediately after Bachelor's is the norm. In essence, I have two choices here: either continue studying operations research or major in machine learning instead. I've had a very hard time deciding which one to choose, since both are very interesting. 

I realize that I might be making a bigger deal of out of this. Whichever major I choose, I can minor in the other one. Nonetheless, I want to make the best possible decision. The operations research major contains some compulsory courses on dynamic optimization which might not be relevant from a data science perspective(?). In the machine learning major, I'd have a better opportunity to do research projects and courses on applications such as NLP. I'm unsure if I want to do a PhD.

How would you approach this decision?",2,3

I am working on classifying 30 second samples of music into one of four genres: [""electronic"", ""hip hop"", ""jazz"", ""rock""] and I would appreciate any kind of help.

I have generated my own data set from mp3 files. Within my ""dataset"" directory, I have arranged 100 songs by genre, putting 25 in subdirectories for each genre (i.e. I have ""electronic"", ""hip hop"", etc subdirectories).

So far, I have extracted 30 second samples of each of these mp3 files, normalized the signal so that no sample exceeds -32 or -18 dB, mixed them down to mono, and converted them to wav (with pyDub).

Next I used librosa to extract mfccs (mel frequency cepstral coefficients) for the 1292 frames in each song. Then I scaled the data so it has zero mean and unit variance using sklearn's preprocessing module.

I took these values and saved them to a csv file of MFFCs, where each row is a frame and each column is one of 12 coefficients.


 I tried simply compiling the 1292 frame vectors for each song into one big vector for each genre, and use that as input for scikitlearn's kNN algorithm. I am getting very unfortunate results, I just get a vector filled with ""rock""

I'm fairly certain I'm not really going about it correctly at all. If anyone could point me in the right direction it would be very much appreciated.


I am trying to understand how to apply my data to actualy train the kNN.

First I apologize for potential mistakes, english is not my native language.


I am a 37 yo guy working as a postdoc in the field of neurosciences. I consider attending to data science for the following reasons:


- I always loved analyzing collected data in my field;


- I know statistics (at least enough to publish scientific papers). I know it surely will not be enough for data science but I am not starting from zero;


- I am not a programmer but I know how to code in Matlab/Python/R.


I am considering switching to data science because I think I would enjoy it as a job, and also because I am tired of academia. With that being said, I wonder (and I hope you guys could give me some insights):


1) would I be taken seriously by employeer if I only have a kaggle/github account as a proof I can work?


2) would my age (37 yo) prevent me from being hired? I fear companies might feel I am too old.

So I recently finished my Undergrad in Computer Science and I am now faced with a decision of which field to pursue for my postgrad study.
I have been lucky enough to be made an offer for both honors in CS and honors in BDA... But I'm having trouble making a firm decision... 
On the one hand we have CS, which is a field I truly enjoy studying and have been doing for some time now. This program is fairly basic, Consists of 1 compulsory research course and 6 other optional CS courses... 
On the other we have BDA, Which is a new honors program started at my university (of which they say acceptance is highly selective). This program seems really cool as it aims to bring together some interesting areas of CS and Math, such as Machine Learning, optimization and multivariate statistics... It's a much more structured program than its CS counter part; Consisting of 5 compulsory courses and 2 optional courses...

As a new graduate, who hasn't had much experience in the real world outside of google... I was hoping that some of you could help me draw a clear line between the 2 fields? And also which would be (in your opinion/experience) a better career choice in the long run?

Thank you!!!",7,0

Real life problem: Imagine parliament/congress where there is a set number of representatives.  The motivation is to decide who wins the election.  Some countries use party lists and fill up seats so that the number of representatives from each party is proportional to the number of voters who voted for the party.  I don't like parties and party lists, so I wanted to find a system where clusters of voters are used instead of parties.

Data science problem: Voters rate the candidates on a scale of 0 to 5.  Higher scores mean closer distance.  We want to reduce the distance between the cluster centers (the candidates) and the data points (the voters).   Also, not all candidates will win (become cluster centers).  Also, all clusters have to be the same size (same number of data points/voters).

What would be a good algorithm to use for forming clusters?

edit: did spectral clustering.  Not sure if it actually works, but seems to be okay for one run: [image](http://imgur.com/EbTLhUL).  I used a combination of python [script](https://gist.github.com/halfout/9ad0448d336b3877c7dfcd338b60f1d4), then matlab [script](https://gist.github.com/halfout/698cebeb2e0ec81246ff3bcb41bde0a1), then python again.  So it could be streamlined.

edit 2: I think I became more clear in the goal.

1. A 2-D map is used to place voters and candidates.  Call this the ""issue space"".  This map is not given in a real world problem.  It is used to generate the data. [voters image](http://imgur.com/UmjxUme) and [candidates image](http://imgur.com/6umQuhl)
2. The data is generated by having each voter rate the candidates based on distance between them.  This creates a bipartite graph between voters and candidates.  This is what a set of ballots would look like and is the starting point for analyzing an election [image](http://imgur.com/QwZIwHy)
3. The ""issue space"" from (1.) is re-created (attempted [image](http://imgur.com/cMW1JxQ)  ) using spectral embedding (basically trying to put connected nodes near eachother.
4. K nearest neighbors is performed to create clusters.  Clusters are constrained to be equal in size. [link](http://algoholic.eu/constrained-k-means-implementation-in-python/)
5. Each cluster votes and elects a candidate.
6. Error check. Hopefully, the candidates and clusters are the best possible matches.  However, there may be a better set of clusters and matches.  The objective is to maximize the sum of the ratings of each winning candidate from their cluster. (This seems difficult.)

Would taking any of these courses actually be particularly helpful for a data scientist/machine learning engineer? Below are syllabuses for the courses.

EDIT: I'm aware that parallel programming itself is important, but since data scientists often use high level tools like Spark/Hadoop etc, I was wondering if some of the more theoretical courses that detail implementation are actually very important.


**Concurrency**
Deterministic processes: traces, operational semantics; prefixing, choice, concurrency and communication. Nondeterminism: failures and divergences; nondeterministic choice, hiding and interleaving. Further operators: pipes and (time permitting) sequential composition. Refinement, specification and proof. Process algebra: equational and inequational reasoning.

**Concurrent Programming**
Reasons for concurrency; processes, threads; safety and liveness. Message passing concurrency; deadlock. Clients and servers. Interacting peers.  Synchronous parallel computation.  Patterns of concurrent programming: data parallel; bag of tasks; recursive parallel; task parallel.  Low-level concurrency controls: monitors; semaphores.

**Concurrent Algorithms and Data Structures**
Mutual exclusion; correctness conditions for concurrent datatypes; foundations of shared memory; the relative power of synchronization methods; universality of consensus. Implementing locks and monitors; implementing concurrent datatypes such as linked lists, queues, counting and sorting networks, hash tables and skip lists.",6,7

so I'm going to be a graduate in Geology at the end of this academic year and I'm having small Existential crisis every other week because I'm 99% sure it's not what i want to do.

I didn't really choose my degree (TLDR  - did foundation year, failed to get into engineering field, was scared of leaving life as i knew it and admitting to parents/friends that i failed, was offered geology at the same uni and blindly accepted) 

I've semi-struggled through geology trying to apply myself and find area's that i enjoy, but aside from the more mathematical aspects, it just feels so dry.

about 6months ago, on a whim, i decided to try my hand at programming starting with html &amp; css/javascript before moving onto python, I'm not proficient by any means, but at this moment i have a good understanding of how it all fits together (arrays, functions, loops, sorting etc.)

while doing my 3rd year project, there was a very large database that i had to sort through to acquire relevant data which lead me on abit of a rabbit hole that ended up with me finding out about data science and ML.

Honestly i find it absolutely fascinating and for the first time i can actually see myself working in the field doing something i love. (i've always viewed learning as something i had to do, but at this current moment i'd rather learn about naive bayes, than go on a night out) 

the issue is that with the heavy workload this year, i don't know how to manage my time and learn everything i need to know, and even with the knowledge base i don't know if anyone will even accept me for an interview without the right qualifications. 

so i'm in a position where more funding is difficult to acquire and being absolutely honest, i'm not sure i want to learn in a university environment for another 3years. 

potential options are therefore to complete a masters conversion to comp-sci (kent does a really cool course with optional modules in data science and a year in industry), to attempt to learn it myself and get an extremely entry level job(and work my way up, although i'm not sure this is even possible) or to save up for sometime and return to uni and do it all over again in something like stats

on a final note even though theres alot i don't like about geology and choosing the path i did may have been a mistake, i've battled through depression, social anxiety and still managed to not fail, i've picked up alot of analytical skills and learnt so much about myself and i feel like i can actually appreciate education and the fun of learning.

sorry for the massive wall of text, but i would love to hear your opinions on my situation and what potential next steps could be, please constructive criticism only

From my understanding so far, bioinformatics is a more specific field inside the broader aspect of data science. 

When I first switched into the major (from pure biology) I hoped to eventually get an MSc in Bioinformatics and work in a bioinformatics/biotech company as an analyst or a developer. The problem is, as I'm progressing through my school and gaining first hand experience with bioinformatics (as well as perusing through /r/bioinformatics) I'm getting a bad feeling that to advance on a purely bioinformatics path, I would need a PhD.

My dilemma is, however, that I'm not sure if I want to dedicate at least 5 more years in an academic setting (possibly more, with low pay). I want to be in the industry entirely. 

This is where I stared looking into data science. I understand it's still a fairly new field and have a few questions:

1) Did any of you make a similar transition from bioinformatics to data science? Can you share your experience with me?

2) From my research in a bioinformatics lab, I know both fields require mining data, storing data, analyzing data, and communicating results. What else are tge typical tasks of a data scientist?

3) I have a pretty solid background in programming (Java, C++, Bash, learning Python and R) and have a decent exposure to statistics and mathematics. If I were to eventually head into data science, where should I go from here? (I'm thinking of taking more stats courses and eventually a machine learning course: gotta take advantage of my university while I'm still enrolled)

Reddit newbie here - woot woot! I've really enjoyed reading the stuff on this subreddit and I was hoping for some advice :)


I graduated ~2 years ago with a BA in Communication Studies and minor in Marketing. After taking a summer marketing internship, I realized that a marketing career was just not what I had hoped it would be. Unfortunately, I only had a semester left before completing my degree program when I came to this realization, so it was too late to switch gears and change majors. Long story short, since graduating, I took a marketing job and, in my spare time, have learned - or in some cases tried to learn - various data science tools, like: Tableau, R, SQL, advanced Excel, basic Python, etc. I'm even leading a Tableau User Group meeting in my community and trying to stay up to date with a Data Science meetup in the area.


I'm trying to get a job as a data analyst of some sort, but am having a hard time quantifying my self-paced learnings (I also have a Tableau Public portfolio that I share in my resume/applications). Because of this experience, I've actually considered going back to school part-time for a BS in computer science, but I'm wondering if it is a waste of time/money/effort to do so, since I already have a Bachelors degree. 


In your opinion, should I take the two years to complete a BS in computer science or would I be better off trying to get into a graduate program? When looking for jobs in data science, is a degree important? Has not having a relevant degree kept you from getting jobs in the data science field? Thank you! :)",16,10

That is what lead my to choose a MS in Data Science/Analytics. Now I am nervous about going on to a PhD as the programs are very specific.

In statistics and Data Science is Geometry and Trig needed? I see the term/name Euclidean thrown around when I quickly look over K-Means clustering content. Before jumping on to learning Linear Algebra + Pre-Calculus, should I learn either or both Geometry and Trig?

I'm 34 years old and my background is a bit different than usual. I have another Master's in clinical psychology and I worked as a freelance webdeveloper (so I'm no stranger to coding) as well as affiliate marketing. I only had one ""official job"" in a webdevelopment company for a couple of years... I didn't apply for more because I earned better as a freelancer and marketer. 

While I could continue down this life of freelancer and marketer, I've fallen in love with data science, machine learning, data analysis and everything in between. So I would really love to work in this field, that's why I chose this course. 

So now I need to make a decision about the second year of my masters: I can choose between an internship (but I need to find the company myself), a project or a thesis. 

Also, eventually I would like to get out of my home country (Portugal) and work somewhere else with better conditions in Europe (or even USA if the opportunity arises). So an international internship in an European country for my 2nd year is also an option. 

Since my goal is to find a job in data science after my master's (and not follow the academic route), what do you think would be the best career move considering my unorthodox background?
