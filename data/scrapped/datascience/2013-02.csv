Have very strong math and stat background, but obviously lacking in computer science.

Right now working a full-time operations research/stat job that doesn't really involve any coding, more along the lines of pretty basic stat in R.

Very comfortable with coding in R, Matlab. Some exposure to javascript, C, perl. No working knowing in any the languages (Perl, C++, Python, Java, etc) that seems to be desired or required.

I guess my question is how I can approach this field without a functional ability to program in one of the languages required? Is self learning of a language the starting point? I don't suppose that all data scientists are veteran software engineers with strong background in math, how much learning on the job is there? Are there even entry level jobs in this field?",1,3,False,self,,,,,
