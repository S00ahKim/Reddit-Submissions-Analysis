0,datascience,t5_2sptq,2015-5-1,2015,5,1,10,34gxr7,self.datascience,How often do you work with normalized data vs straight quantities?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/34gxr7/how_often_do_you_work_with_normalized_data_vs/,pybokeh,1430444232,"The reason I ask, it seems some of the blogs or examples on the Internet I see about data analysis or data science usually show trivial examples of obtaining straight quantities and then they make basic visualizations out of them.   Where I work as a data analyst at an auto manufacturer, I work with warranty claim quantities.  However, when comparing one model versus another model, just using straight quantities are meaningless for comparing models.  In order to make fair comparisons, we normalize our data by dividing the number of warranty claims/defects by the number of vehicles sold. This is a metric we call ""defect rate"" or ""warranty claim rate"".  I know in other manufacturing facilities they use the term ""percent non-conforming"".  I know over the years, I've seen inexperienced data analysts make the mistake of using straight quantities in order to make comparisons.  
  
Here is an IPython [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pybokeh/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/work/Cum_Defect_Rate_Replaced-AF_RO-State-WordCloud.ipynb) I made for prototyping purposes that creates what we call ""Cumulative Defect Rate"" vs months since the model was released into the market (months since start of sales).  Other charts are defect rates by vehicle build month.  Again, most of these metrics are simply the number of claims divided by the number of vehicles sold to normalize things.  We use this type of metric a lot at our company and I'd imagine most other companies do when dealing with warranty claim data or failure data.  NOTE: due to my company's confidentiality obligations, this is a fictitious vehicle problem (windshield wiper arm) and the SQL statement was slightly modified.   
  
The warranty and sales data are in a DB2 database.  Since I am obtaining and processing both the claims and sales data simultaneously, the SQL is pretty hairy although it is basically a UNION query.  If I was just doing analysis of straight quantities, my life would be much easier!  Which is sort of why I posed this question.  Then I use Python's pandas library to create the cumulative defect rate calculations and months since start of sales.  I also use R's choroplethr package to make the choropleth map and R's wordcloud package.  I know there is a Python wordcloud package, but I can't get it to install on Windows at work which I don't have admin rights for, so I had to resort to using R's wordcloud package.  
  
Anyways, I am curious what data others use that they must normalize.  I look forward to seeing examples from others as I always wonder what interesting data other data analysts/scientists use.  
  
EDIT: If you're looking for a job as a data analyst or data scientist, I would definitely consider the major automotive companies in the U.S..  We work with all kinds of vast amounts of data (production data, sales data, warranty data, failure data, and for a few, streaming vehicle sensor data).  At my company, since we are sensitive to privacy issues, we will probably be one of the last to ever capture location or certain sensor data.  So that means, we dont process ""big data"" yet.  I predict once we start capturing sensory data, we will run into big data problems.  I truly believe that automakers are not prepared when they start capturing sensory and location data.  Most major automakers sell several million cars a year, multiply that times the number of different things that can go wrong with a car, multiple that times the number of data attributes that are available, it is mind-boggling.  So I think this is an area where people in the data field can shine.  I have heard other automakers are already capturing some location data which I have personal reservations with, but that is for a different discussion.",4,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently a second year undergraduate student majoring in Statistics, with a minor in Computer Science. I want to go into data science and analytics because simply put - it is freaking awesome, and I can't see myself as a developer typing lines and lines of pure software code the whole day.  However, I do love writing code and statistics, so thought this would be a great path for me. 

Right now, I do research in machine learning and am comfortable programming with R, Python (scipy, numpy, sci-kit learn), and MATLAB. I am also familiar with Java, Bash, and to a lesser extent, C++. I have done some network analysis and representations for exploratory data analysis. The exploratory data analysis has been represented in graphs such as clustergrams, dendrograms and spectrograms. I have taken classes in time series, applied regression analysis in R, bayesian statistics, models of applied statistics, mathematical statistics, intro to CS, data structures, and discrete structures. 

In order to get into analytics/data science, and ace interviews for internships next summer, what do you guys think I should be devoting my time to now? Should I start learning tools like Hadoop, Scala, SQL, MapReduce, etc? Also, what are some good university level courses I should look into taking?

Also, I want to do a data science oriented project over the summer to learn more and to showcase my talents to recruiters next year. Any ideas on what I could do, or where I could go to find a suitable topic?  ",24,4,False,self,,,,,

How about Stanford's MS in Statistics with Data Science Track or Zipfian Academy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/35bxh9/are_data_science_masters_programs_like_uc/,AndreNowzick,1431118671,"See this: [UC Berkeley Master's in Data Science](http://datascience.berkeley.edu/) costs $60,000 for 27 units

VS. 

[Stanford MS Statistics w/ Data Science](https://statistics.stanford.edu/academics/ms-statistics-data-science) ~$50,000.

The UC Berkeley Master's in Data Science is nice because it's easier to get into with a 3.49 GPA, and 85% GRE but almost impossible for most people at Stanford given 10% admission rate, 3.9 GPA, and 91% GRE percentiles, etc.

The Berkeley Master's program touts being a practical program, plus you can work full time while taking 2 classes a semester (which are done over 20 months so about a year and a half), so working full time helps negates the price of the program.

On the other hand, there is Stanford's Master's in Statistics in Data Science which can't be done online, $45,000, means that you'll have to take time off from work, and it's also much harder to get into (almost impossible imo), but arguably more theoretical than practical, but it's Stanford name which may help in industry? 

There's Zipfian Academy which is a 1000 hour bootcamp which trains students to become proficient in Data Science and also very challenging but about $10,000 and is probably the most practical of them all. 

Then there's self-study/self-paced, but I'm not too thrilled or able to teach myself all on my own and need some external pressure.

I can't think of any other options, but what other options exist that may be practical. UC Berkeley's program is nice if you want to work full time, and it's almost like you're doing the program for ""free"" compared to Stanford where you're losing about 2 years of your life, and in opportunity costs.

But is the Master's from Berkeley worth it when there are graduate certificates from say Stanford that are more concise and cheaper like the [Data Mining &amp; Applications certificate](http://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=1209602) or [Mining Massive Data Sets Certificate](http://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=10555807) offered through Stanford which gets you the name for for much cheaper. 

Of course, work experience triumphs all, but it seems there is at least a bias towards those who minimally have a Master's degree, and more preferred a PhD. ",73,22,False,self,,,,,

I think my skill set is more in tune with data science, but I am worried about long term job prospects. It seems that right now data scientists are doing very well in the job market averaging around $120,000 in the Bay Area, and some may peak around at $150,000 on a typical career path which is better than what programmers are making. But some people whether here, or on the web have said that most data scientists are overglorified data analysts, and that in the next few years data scientists' salaries will fall drastically after the ""hype is over."" They say that they are basically glorified statisticians who know how to code a little and ask the right questions. 

On the other hand,  programmers are making around $105,000 in the Bay Area, and the pay seems to have stabilized around that point. 

The other thing that I want to mention is that I think a programmer is going to be the backbone of a company whereas a data science serves more of an auxiliary role (useful, but not necessary), so there could be more job security in programming.  

I think, personally speaking, I find pros/cons in both fields. Data science seems to be more breadth and programming more depth/narrow in focus. I could see myself doing either/or.

I am particularly looking to do a bootcamp also either through Hack Reactor/App Academy or Zipfian Academy, so I want to finalize my study plan before I commit on one path. Also, I think a boot camp wouldn't be enough, so I would be looking to do a post-bacc in CS/Master's through Georgia Tech OR doing a Master's in Data Science/Analytics. 

I know this is probably a DS-biased forum, but what are your thoughts on salaries, long-term growth/opportunity, and so on. Is DS a ""fad"" and that salaries will cool down over the years when/if companies could determine that DSes could be paid less?

I'm a recent college graduate (math and econ double major) with a little work experience in business and statistics.  

&amp;nbsp;

I've seen this thread be pretty down on programs such as Berkeley's.  But Carnegie Mellon's program [has a pretty detailed breakdown of their students' career placement](http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-information-systems-and-management/information-systems-management-mism/careers/placement-information/index.aspx
).  (Make sure to click on the BIDA emphasis.) Median Salaries are over 100K with placement at elite management consulting firms as well as Google, IBM, Amazon, etc.  As well as an over 95% placement rate. I've spoken with an alumnus who says that placement is particularly good if you don't need sponsorship to live in the US since a lot of the students aren't American citizens.  

&amp;nbsp;

However, I'd love the added flexibility of being able to live wherever I want and work full time while doing Berkeley's program.  Berkeley's program hasn't yet seen a cohort finish and enter the workforce so they don't have any data on placement.  But r/datascience seems to say that these programs are overrated and that graduates don't fare much better for having taken the program.  For that to be true then Berkeley's program must have inferior prospects to CMU's.  Do you think that is true or are people unnecessarily down on Berkeley?




I'd love to hear from someone currently in Berkeley's Data Science program. Or someone who might consider hiring out of that program.

Another reason I am asking this question is because at my medical school, we're thinking of developing an informatics course for future medical school students so that they at least have a basic understanding on how to analyze the incoming tsunami of data from EMR and health sensors.   How do we teach those skills without scaring away students who don't know how to code?  (IE overcome the steep technical learning required)

Also, how should one make models (MVC models) for Users,Posts etc keeping analysis in mind.

One thing I could think of was having another model (mvc model) called meta_user which contains all the meta information about the User model and then use a foreign key between these two models. 

Then, on a daily basis, run the ML scripts on the meta_user table and make an API or something for the predictions which takes the userID and other things as input and returns the prediction. 

I would need to make a meta_entity for each important model (Posts etc)

Or, I should save the meta information inside the User itself and script things in such away.

What is the industry way of keeping analytics and normal data storage at peace?

Is there any literature on the web regarding this?

I started my current role 3 years ago as an executive officer and due to necessity slowly transitioned into a database manager (not DBA) as well as generating analytical reports using SQL querying and moderate excel functions.  Note, I did not do the actual analysis, although I was called on to give insight often.

After some introspection about this adopted role, I've come to explore the possibility of pursuing a career into Data Science.  Part of this plan includes the possibility of going back to school for a Master's next fall, while another part is trying to find a new job that would give me experience, even if tangential, to Data Science to learn the skills and gain the experience necessary.  I'm concerned because while I have extensive business background, I have little statistical background, and the SQL knowledge was learned out of necessity and I only know what I use on a regular basis, not to mention that it's the only language I know.

My questions are:

1. How likely is it for me to get hired in a data analysis position (to build up to a data science position) or get accepted into a graduate program with the skills I have?  I am open to taking courses to catch up on the material I am lacking.
1. What type of job should I be looking for as a precursor to a career in data science.

* Degree in Finance, know SQL but little else
* Been working in SQL querying for analytical reporting for the past 3 years
* Can I make it in the world of Data Science, and if so, what steps should I take?",6,0,False,self,,,,,

1) Is this a simple no-no? 

2) Do you just start afresh on the new data, and forgo the old historical data when it's based off of slightly different settings?

**Here's the scenario for context:**

A data source used to provide data that had 70% of it removed ('scrubbed' - to help data remain 'annonymous'). It's still useful for estimates and insights in monthly reports. 

The data source provider then creates a new data source to replace the old one, and this time they remove (scrub) only 30-50% of the data.

Now, monthly report shows trends, and comparing figures from one data set to the previous has implications. 

**Would you forgo the historical data, and start afresh reporting on only their updated data set?**

Sorry I should have explained better. They removed 70% of data to keep the data 'annonymous'. Their new alternative method may only be removing 30% of data (so the data set is now more accurate representation of the whole).

I've worked as a software product manager for about 10 years, and at this point am looking to build up my skillset.

I'm a bit torn between an MBA (which I consider to be mostly bullshit, but a checkbox for many companies at higher level positions), or going a more technical route.

Data science always interested me, **but I have very limited programming experience**.  I can do the fundamentals (arrays, loops, OOP basics) in languages like php/ruby/python, but have not spent any time on algorithms, data structures,  best practice code patterns, etc.

**Programming in general has always been a bit frustrating to me**, though somewhat satisfying when I solve something.  Despite being what I'd consider pretty intelligent, CS always was hard for me.

**With that in mind, does it even make sense to go into data science/big data?**

If I don't become a rockstar programmer, would it be really hard to move up in this field?  What roles can be had with minimal coding, if any?

In my current middle-manager-ish type career, you can get by with basic knowledge of the technology, but I'm finding it to be a bit empty.   Thoughts for someone like me?  I'm nearly 35, so a hard reset into CS could be pretty brutal and involve a pay cut.

However, would it be possible to do data science work with a lighter understanding of CS?  I'd love to hear what your typical day looks like.
