I need ur advice on my next step, specifically should i study bachelor of data science or master of data science or any suggestion would be appreciated. I graduated from Bachelor of civil engineering in 2014. due to personal circumstances i wasnt able to apply jobs in my field and so just did some odd jobs. however, now i wanna get back to focus on my career. as i reflected back, i thoroughly enjoyed mathematics, statistics and engineering modelling, those few subjects in my engineering program. and since data science can be applied in various industries, this piqued my interest even more. im not gearing towards being data analyst in engineering sector though im not against it if the opportunity comes my way.

My degree has involved a ton of problem solving and maths obviously but not a lot of statistics, plus besides intro and data analysis classes in Python I haven't got a ton of coding experience, although I did do a couple of weeks as an intern at my hometown university's data analytics department last summer, working on a project with Python (pandas, matplotlib, bit of scikitlearn).

Basically my dilemma is, I can't decide whether to spend next year doing an MS in Data Science at said university, or applying for a year long paid internship (~15k tax free) at the same department I interned at over summer. The internship gets a fair few applicants but they have an intake of around 10 people and my supervisor I worked with said with my grades and the fact I'd spent time in the department already, I had a good shot of getting on the program. 

In any case, I can feasibly apply for both and then use the MS as a backup if I don't get the internship, but I'm just unsure as to which is going to help me the most going forward and wondered if you guys could shed any light? Thanks for taking the time to read! ",8,1

I currently work in a business analysis function in the healthcare industry, and am looking to broaden my technical skill set with a new tool in the new year.  Much of the work I do, involves either pulling data from a BI tool, or working with a BI developer who will do the querying for me, however once that is done it will in many cases involve some sort of clean-up, which I have typically done in Excel.  

What I'm hoping to find is a tool that can help automate this clean-up, able to do some sort of statistical analysis of that data, and then be able to output some sort of visual analysis so I can minimize work done in Excel which is either time consuming or has the human factor or error involved. Additionally, I'm hoping to start finding ways to build projects by scrapping data off of various websites to then build some sort of model(s) (though this is a future dream). 

After some research, it seems to come down to these three tools.  I have access to SAS EG, however there doesn't seem to be a lot of free or cheap (compared to R or Python) online training out there. Which leaves me guessing my route should involve learning something such as R or Python?  I'm hoping to look for something that has relatively accessible online training modules which I can try to then apply at work, such as Data Camp and Data Quest.  From my research, R seems to be rooted in more statistical applications, whereas Python seems to be more multi purpose and can solve a lot of the same problems.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm trying to **setup a data science platform** for my company but I'm having trouble figuring out the best system with regards to publishing and sharing results.  

&amp;nbsp;

I need users to be able to:  
* Access published research (i.e notebooks)  
* Modify published research without changing it for other users  
* Share their own notebooks with specific people (no need for realtime sharing just read access and local modification for viewers \*)  
* Publish their notebooks to make them accessible to everyone  

&amp;nbsp;  

For the first two points I'm thinking of using Jupyter Hub it seems like the perfect use case. Users will be able to access the main directory where the published research will be located and test out changes in their own directory on the remote server.    

&amp;nbsp;  

For the last point I'm thinking of integrating the main directory with our **version control system**, seems like it should be simple enough though I welcome any comments if you've done this before.  
I'm also thinking a simple publish button that copies private user notebooks to the main public directory, it would be a nice easy addition for non technical users.  
 
&amp;nbsp;  

For the third point I'm at a complete loss, I found **hubshare** which seems to be the official project for sharing user notebooks but it's not at a useable stage.  
I'm thinking maybe the most practical way to do it would be to integrate the jupyter hub folders with google drive and use **google drive**'s built-in permissions and file sharing system but I'm not sure how to do that.  

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone have experience doing something like that? What kind of 'stack' did you go with and how did you go about setting it up?  
I'd be grateful for any help in solving these issues.

Cheers.

Something like this [Applied Machine Learning course by UIUC.](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/courses/LearningCourse17/498-home.html)

Hi all and Happy New year !

I work on an extrusion machine new generation (as a technician) and I want to know if it's possible (with neural network) to find a prediction model which guess what is the output shape of the rubber according to all input parameter.

I already did with python a model which do that but with linear and polynomial regression, the performance is around 0.8 which is nice but I want more. That's why I'm wondering if neural networks can do that (I'm actually learning how to use keras). 

If you have read some scientific paper about it or some similar application, I would like to know about it ! :)

Thanks and have a nice year !",5,1

I don't know if a similar question was asked before. I saw one similar question but it was from a science PhD, so I figured mine isn't the same.
I recently completed a PhD in Political science. I did a lot of applied statistics for my projects, doing mostly different kinds of regressions, data cleaning, the occasional web scraping and data visualization. I do use R for a lot of stuff and I have experience using Stata, SAS and I have started learning SQL, to the point where I am familiar with the language but I have not done anything other than practice code.

 I don't have much experience working with big data or using Python or even doing machine learning procedures, so I figure an entry level data analysis should be what I should focus on. 
My question is, should I hide the PhD since it is a bachelor position? 

During the PhD I worked as a research assistant and was a TA. So I do have something to show for the four years after my masters. I don't want my PhD to send a negative signal as I do want to work in data analysis and have no plans to jump ship. I do have a blog which shows some of the stuff I have done using R, but nothing too fancy and I haven't even gotten into git-hub yet.

&amp;nbsp;  

Here are the course descriptions:  
&amp;nbsp;  
Simulation:
&gt;The course has three main topics: (a) Introduction to discrete-event simulation models and simulation studies; (b) Organization of simulation languages, and modeling with Arena, a comprehensive simulation package with animation capabilities; and (c) Statistical aspects of simulation, including input analysis, random variate generation, output analysis, and variance reduction techniques. The course will include a small probability/statistics review; hand simulation, spreadsheet simulation, and Arena simulation; general modeling concepts and examples; random variate generation including single random variable generation and random processes, input and output analysis, comparisons of systems, and variance reduction. 
 
&amp;nbsp;  
Deterministic Optimization:
&gt;The course will teach basic concepts, models, and algorithms in linear optimization, integer optimization, and convex optimization. The first module of the course is a general overview of key concepts in linear algebra, calculus, and optimization. The second module of the course is on linear optimization, covering modeling techniques, basic polyhedral theory, simplex method, and duality theory. The third module is on convex conic optimization, which is a significant generalization of linear optimization. The fourth and final module is on integer optimization, which augments the previously covered optimization models with the flexibility of integer decision variables. The course blends optimization theory and computation with various applications to modern data analytics.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Simulation looks more interesting, but the Deterministic Optimization seems more relevant and also difficult. Can anyone provide some feedback/suggestions on the content and the relevancy to data science?

Well, this just happened: www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~norman/papers/lawnmowers.pdf.
  
Informally, Talebs argument is that there is a key difference between risks that are **systemic**, which can affect more than one person (such as a terrorist attack) and those that are not (such as using a lawnmower) which can be considered **random**. The chances that the number of people who die from a non-systemic risk, like using a lawnmower, will double next year are extremely unlikely. But this cannot be said about the number of people dying from systemic risks like terrorist attacks and epidemics. The latter can be multiplicative whereas the former cannot. It is impossible
for a thousand people in New York City to die from using lawnmowers next year, but it is not impossible for a thousand to die there from terrorist attacks.

2. Mean imputations are affected by outliers, I prefer bagged decision trees or KNN methods
3. Decision trees prefer fewer, more powerful features, while support vector machine (SVM) work well with a large number of weak features

I realize some of these examples may be subjective and arguably conditional under specific circumstances, but I do find these little insights help my general awareness as I continue to learn more about the subject matter and rules of thumb that aren't generally discussed or perhaps more so, implied.

Since college changed rules this year projects are supposed to be more ""practical"" in nature, meaning I can't just collect data and analyze it or do some kind of blue sky research, it has to result in an actual (web)application that users can interact with.

This is why I'm making cookbook that will recommend new recipes based on previous user preferences and generate price and waste optimized weekly menu for my user.

Problem is collecting data. Since I obviously don't have enough users to draw data from I was thinking of creating ""biased"" bots to mimic users that will go through randomly generated recipes and decide if they like them or not based on ingredients that make a certain recipe. For example, if my recipe contains `peper`, `salt`, `sugar` and `apple` and is categorized as `desert` I than might have two bots with following preferences / likings for each of those ingredients :

    Bot 01 : peper (20%), salt (50%), sugar (80%), apple (30%), desert (34%)
    Bot 02 : peper (60%), salt (45%), sugar (85%), apple (36%), desert (26%)

The chance of `Bot 01` liking this particular recipe would be (0.2+0.5+0.8+0.3+0.34)/5 and than I'd run random number generator to finally decide if my bot will actually add that recipe to his favourites (which will be my training data set).

**This seems practical since I can save my bots preferences and test performance of my algorythm, but I'm wondering if this is a good approach. Also, all papers and blog posts that I have found on randomly generated data sets requires some base data set (which I don't have) from which I extrapolate further generated data.**

Title of my project is ""Use of use of optimization algorithms and machine learning in the context of functional programming language Haskell"" and the idea is to explore techniques and ways of using and implementing data science / ml algorithms in Haskell (sort of a review with more ""practical"" approach really) but I'd still like to do things properly.

If someone can point me to some resources on using randomly generated data / models in data science / ml for testing purposes that would be great. Also, I'm interested in advice on what algorithms to use, I was thinking of using simple clustering for recommendation system.",4,9

I'm working on a program that's meant to help the user place bets. It's a bit of a practice project, as I took a long break from learning code. I poll myself and others who watch MMA (currently just two of my siblings) on who would win upcoming UFC fights. To evaluate how close the fight is, I ask how many times (out of 10) each would win the match-up. I also ask how thoroughly they know the match-up (out of 5), which weights each person's input. I then enter them into the program, and it lists two numbers for each fighter; the odds at which you should consider betting on them (from this point referred to as ""good bet""), and the odds at which you should definitely bet on them (which will be called ""safe bet""). 

The good bet odds are essentially just everyone's input combined and spat back out, so if our collective input says it's 50-50, it would say to bet on them at even odds - if it says they'd win 1 out of 3, then you'd need to win double your bet for it to be worth putting money on them. The safe bet odds are much more drastic, and are meant to demonstrate what an extreme mismatch odds-wise would look like; it also is made slightly more cautious if the people polled indicate that they don't know the match-up that well. The user would then compare these numbers to the actual betting odds, and place bets where the program disagrees with the Vegas oddsmakers.

I recently discovered that the website MMAJunkie has 10 of their staff pick who they think will win each fight on the main card of every event. They also do a reader poll. Each staff has been 53-60% accurate this year, and the reader poll has a similar accuracy. This data is too tasty to pass on, which is where my problem begins.


**How do I use this?!?**

On one hand, the polling I do is much more thorough, and more helpful for what this is meant to help do, which is pick where it's worth risking money on an upset, and avoid betting on overly-favored fighters. If I include data that only tries to predict who will win, it seems difficult to do that in a way that won't cause the program to do the opposite, causing the user to lose money even while winning the majority of their bets due to not playing the odds.

On the other hand, the MMAJunkie staff are all enthusiasts with a high level of knowledge on the sport, including the current condition of each fighter. Their input may be more valuable than ours even if it is less nuanced, and there's more of them than I can currently poll. The reader poll is especially confusing, because it comes with some nuance (they list the percentage that voted for each person), but will also likely line up with the Vegas odds pretty consistently.

The ways that I currently see to make use of this data:

* Include the MMAJunkie data in the odds, but weight it to have a small influence
* Include the MMAJunkie data only in the safe bet odds
* Make the good bet and safe bet odds identical except that the safe bet odds are affected by the MMAJunkie data
* Leave the good bet and safe bet odds unaffected, and have the program output a third and maybe fourth number for each fighter which would include the MMAJunkie input

The last one seems most logical to me, but part of what this program is meant to do is help with how bad humans are at evaluating odds by translating the way you feel about the fight into a quantity that can be easily compared to the Vegas odds. I'm not sure if this is undone by throwing a bunch of numbers at the user, even if the user is me.

So, how would you go about utilizing the MMAJunkie data?",3,7

Wanting to enter the field, what's the best course to take or certifications to pursue for beginners?

I've done research through extension courses. According to some websites UCSD's business intelligence certification is beginners friendly and also CSUF. I've looked into the Ivy League's extension courses, but those are $10,000 per certification vs the $3,000 - $4,000 range from the UC/CSU system. UC Berk's certification is endorsed education provider of the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA), but I'm worried that I won't get as much hands-on experience compared to the UCSD's. For example, UC Berk offers 4 classes for $4,000 total, and UCSD offers 5 classes with for around $3,650 total with books etc included as an estimate. But then again, I'm basing this on what I read on pamphlets. Which certification is more valuable?

I was wondering about the following : 

* split up film into frames 
* detect which frames have clear faces in them (in the foreground)  
* detect which faces are ""frontal"" (rather than the side of a face)

I'm not sure if that's a well defined problem or not. How I imagine it being done is to take some video file, 

* split it into n frames (n could vary), 
* for each frame run something to detect whether it has a face ( discard if not ) 
* for each frame with a face detect whether it is front facing (discard if not) 

This question is based more broadly on an interest - I don't have any specific code to share, and I'm unlikely to be able to follow anything that's expressed at a very low level. Just thought that I'd note that.

I work with production models that utilize features with lots of 'lagged' and aggregated variables that start in SQL(Redshift) tables. Most of the models are based on time series predictions, so the lags are necessary to capture behavior that happened in the last week, or last month, or last 3 days, ect. We try to implement the feature creation with large joins and temp tables as efficiently as possible. Unfortunately, for very large models, this ends up being very slow and we're seeing a pretty poor scaling as the number of DB nodes increases. For reference, we're dealing with 10's to 100's of GBs of data per feature set. 

I'm doing a little initial research into in-memory solutions to speed up the process, but my initial tests with Spark clusters aren't really out-performing the current Redshift solution. With Spark, I'm basically performing group-by operations in a cluster that reads from some atomic SQL tables, but the final result is no faster than Redshift on the same number of nodes. Does anyone have experiences with other approaches for this type of feature creation? Has anyone tried breaking out the process into tons of tiny concurrent chunks with Golang?

Most of my professional experience has been with python, so maybe breaking into some new paradigms will help.

Love to have some discussion about this type of scaling!

*The course will develop skills in mathematical modeling through practical experience. Students will work in groups on specific projects involving real-life problems that are accessible to their existing mathematical backgrounds. In addition to the development of mathematical models, effective oral and written presentation of the results will be emphasized.*

*The main objective of this course is to learn from experience the various aspects of the modeling process, including: 
Formulating and refining a mathematical model 
Mathematical and computational analysis of the model 
Oral and written communication of the results 
Mathematical techniques discussed will be motivated by problems from areas such as physics, biology, economics, etc.*

*This is a course on data-driven mathematical modeling as a process, not as a collection of techniques. Students will work in teams on projects motivated by real-life problems, and will, with the aid of the instructor, complete the entire process from analyzing data to formulating mathematical models calibrated from that data to mathematical, statistical, and computational analysis of these models to oral and written presentation of the results. Some background in linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, basic probability and statistics, and computational methods is expected. Additional mathematics will be introduced as dictated by the projects.*

I'll be finishing up my math degree this Spring and then will hopefully do a one year DS program, along with self-learning. I was wondering how useful this course would be - as far as can be gathered from this description.

I have also been working on digital marketing and getting pretty interested in it and passionate about it. My dilemma is while data science is a good career field, that also pays very well it is just way too technical. 

Don't get me wrong I love the technical side but I dont like just crunching numbers I also enjoy creativity and using my imagination and ingenuity, when I look at Data Science job postings they kind of repulse me with all the technical jargon some times of what I will be doing. Digital Marketing on the other hand is so much more interesting to me much more creativity and exciting, still has some technicality to it as well. The only thing is it pays basically half as much as data science does. With 3 years of experience I can make how much data scientists make starting out. 

I figure there is some way for me to bridge the two, but I doubt there will be a job that I find that will pay me well to do that. And i'd prefer the split be much more heavy on the digital marketing side as well. Another thing I like about digital marketing is that I feel like I can be an expert and one of the best at it, if I apply myself because it is so much more interesting where as data science is just so technical that its borderline boring and uninteresting to me.

First, some background. Most of my day-to-day work consists of ETL and making visualizations and most of our data is in MSSQL. I do all ETL in python and make visuals in Tableau. I am already attending the Tableau conference in October.

Despite doing mainly etl, I am very interested in getting better at predictive analytics and machine learning. Knowing this, which conferences should I consider? I have looked at KDD, PyCon, PyData, Strata, EDW, and ODSC but am unsure which would give me the post practical knowledge. If anyone has attended any of these in the past I would also love to hear a bit about your experience. ",6,6

I'm a MSc in Psychology looking to either transition into Data Science or to at least expand my current knowledge to implement new methods in my research.

Now since there are a lot of options out there, but my insight into the field is still limited, I have a couple of questions I'm gonna be posting here over the next few days.

One of my options is going back to university and doing another MSc with a stronger focus on Data Science. This program here sounds promising, because it combines behavioral science and data science, which would be exactly what I'm looking for:

http://www.uva.nl/m-programmas/gsp/masters/psychology-behavioural-data-science/behavioural-data-science.html?origin=znSrDUT%2BQ5uz6dso72fBmw

Has anybody here gone through this program? How well did it prepare you for a job in data science? How high was the workload (specifically, was it possible to work for 56 hours / month or more next to studying)? Would you say there was a strong enough focus on the connection between behavioral science and data science to warrant not getting a designated data science degree? 

And to everybody else: if you were hiring a data scientist, how high would you value a graduate from this program in comparison to somebody with a MSc in data science or in comparison to somebody with a MSc in psychology who gathered their knowledge by self study / online courses like Udemy?

My understanding so far is that first a tf*idf is built using only the documents in the corpus...

- I run through the corpus to build a list of the N unique 'tokens' over the full corpus
- For each document I create a vector of size N where each element is the number of occurrences of the corresponding 'token' in the document
- This gives me K vectors in total which together form the tf matrix, let's call this matrix tf(corpus) [note: let's disregard normalization of this matrix for the moment...]
- I calculate the idf vector for the corpus, a vector of size N, each element essentially being the number of documents (K) divided by the sum of occurrences of the corresponding token in all documents (and some log function for etc..), let's call this idf(corpus)
- Finally I multiply tf(corpus) by idf(corpus) to get the tf*idf matrix for the corpus

Next (assuming above is correct) I construct a separate tf*idf for the query... my understanding is

- I create a vector size N containing the counts for each token as found in the query =&gt; essentially this is the tf(query) matrix (a query is a single document, so only one row)
- I multiply tf(query) with idf(corpus) to get the tf*idf for the query


And finally (assuming above is correct) I use cosine similarity (or similar) to calculate the similarity of each individual vector in the tf*idf of the corpus with the tf*idf of the query

Is my understanding correct?

If not, what am I doing wrong?

I guess my question is that should I wait till I learn how to code before beginning an independent project? Or would it not hurt to go forward with the one that I've started now with Excel?

I have just been offered a role as a Data Scientist with Synechron, an international FinTech consulting firm. I would be based out of Dubai initially and would be doing plenty of travel to their offices in NYC, London, Singapore, India, etc.

I have focussed a lot of my studies on the maths side of things, and more recently stats, AI, and ML. Because of this, Data Science has become very appealing to me. I have also always been very interested in the Finance Industry, and it has always been a goal of mine to eventually work in Algorithmic Trading. I am also completing my final year project in a Deep Learning application to the stock markets.

From what I have been told, I will be working frequently on projects with some of the largest banks, hedge funds, etc. in NYC with work focussed heavily on ML, Deep Learning and NLP. This is the biggest pull for me towards this job. However, I am still skeptical - it sounds like an incredible role (almost too good to be true) so why are they hiring me, an undergrad, as opposed to Masters/PhD grads? Also, surely these huge banks and secretive Hedge Funds would hire their own employees to do this very in-depth AI/ML work?

On top of this, I have been offered another job as a C++ developer with a company who produce physical, and cloud-based systems for clients who require their infrastructure to work with extrememly low latency. I would gain great experience in low-level programming, the Linux kernel, and networking/infrastructure. This experience would also be extremely valuable to be working in the likes of High Frequency or Algo Trading.

Is working as a Data Scientist with Synechron really as good as they make it out to be? Would it be too much of a risk to pass by on the unique experience I would get in the other role I have been offered?

If not, I would get computer science/software engineering masters degree. Do you think this would be a better route or a bigger waste of time and money?

I did classical Titanic datasets EDA just for practice and I think I found really troublesome error in the Titanic dataset itself. I searched Kaggle for any reports but did not find any. Here is mine.

I was analysing passengers demographic structure and Age attribute. At this part of analysis by accident I found found out that person appearing in the dataset as the oldest age (80) is the age of actual death many years after person disaster survival. This means that dataset age information for this passenger, by error, contains value of post Titanic death age and not the day of disaster age as it does for other survived passengers age attribute values. This inconsistency makes the data invalid and confusing when it comes to factual or historical value.

Go to section ""3.3 What was Titanic passengers demographic structure analysed in terms of attributes?"" of my analysis here to check it out. 
https://github.com/msznajder/titanic_survival_analysis_kaggle

I mean the error is troublesome as far as real facts are concerned and dataset wide usage and distribution. It is like in Iris dataset there were some inconsistent measurements with a few centimeters of errors.

I'm comfortable with Python and have a data analysis project in it as well.

I'm currently interviewing for this Data Analyst internship with this relatively small (33 employees) startup. The internship would basically have me work with oil market analysis, although I think they would have me work with solely Excel, and SQL, which I still have yet to learn. It'd be potentially 12-15 hours a week at $13/hr.

My plan has been to take at least 18 credits for each of my last 3 semesters to graduate on time with a Computer Science minor. My plan is to further self-learn and educate on Machine Learning and Data Science, and eventually enroll for a CS Masters. The dream would be to maybe even snag a Data Science internship at a big company either this or next summer (ambitious and unlikely, I know, but hey, you never know.)

I may have to drop a class for this internship (a core requirement), but doing so would mean I couldn't graduate on time unless I dropped the CS minor.

Would the data analyst internship potentially carry enough weight to potentially help me transition to a data science role more quicker, or should I continue on my current plan, not overload myself and continue with the minor to better prepare myself for grad school?

Thanks!

I am a data scientist at Satalia. I would like to share a data science workflow that blends exploration and production.

This workflow is an attempt to bridge the gap between exploration in data science and productionisation in software development. What motivated me to create this workflow is the lack of a specific training in software development that data scientists may have. A lack of software development skills typically leads to scripted and untidy code that is not modular. In turn, software developers (and sometimes data scientists) have a hard time productionising such code. That's why I created a data science workflow with the end-product in mind.

The workflow is an adaptation of methods, mainly from software engineering, with additional new ideas. I have tested the workflow with colleagues and friends, but I am aware that there are things to improve. So, it would be nice to have some feedback from you. Thanks!

I'm a biomedical scientist, currently on my Master's degree. 

I've recently learned about Data Science, but I'm still very much a beginner. Some collaborators of my research project use R to analyze proteomic data, so I've decided to start on that, since it immediately applies to my project.

However, starting my studies in R led me to discover the bigger field of Data Science. I'm still absolutely a noob about it who barely know what Data Science really means, so I turn to help to you guys:

I'm considering taking up data science as a skill to apply to my scientific work, in order to become a more valuable member of my research group. Is my idea feasible, or Data Science really is more for big business? Does someone here work with Data Science in actual scientific research? What are the applications?

I tried googling things like ""Data science in scientific research"", but haven't found much. Just want to know if you guys think data science skills are useful for scientific research and, if possible, how. 

This is probably a very stupid, very basic question and I'm sorry for that. Thanks nonetheless to those who reply. ",16,6

I'm going through Jose Portilla's Udemy course for data science and machine learning. My gripe is not at all about the course, I've learned a lot and it's been very enjoyable. And I've got to the machine learning section, and I'm finding it's not at all what I thought it was going to be. 

A couple of examples: 

Linear Regression: This is probably the most common of all machine learning and probably the simplest to do without having to learn much about Data Science. But what about predicting numerical values based off of other factors? For example, I ran a linear regression on some data I have for survey scores, coupled with other factors such as sex, education level, Grit score etc. It was good at pointing out the linear regressions, but what about predicting unknown survey scores based on other factors? 

Also, I just finished the Logistic Regression section of the Titanic Data set, and that was cool too. But what about really knowing which of the factors played into survival? The algorithm was decent at making the predictions, but at the end of the day, how do you really know which of these factors played a role, and which didn't? Aside from just removing or adding data. 

I understand I'm just scraping the surface, and some of these questions could very well be answered by using different ML algorithms. But does anyone have any thoughts or insights on this, or has anyone experienced some similar feelings?

I have worked on projects with the leaders creating this team and networked with some of the folks already hired to the team, so I'll be a recognizable face. Through those discussions it seems like there are a couple gaps I would need to cover to meet some of the technical requirements:  

* Knowledge of Bayesian methods
* Knowledge of Deep Learning methods
* Able to write TensorFlow code (or H2O)

These were already in my learning pipeline, but to be sure the opportunity doesn't pass me by I want to accelerate my learning specifically in these areas. Some things I'm already doing:  

* Working through Dataquest.io exercises to brush up my Python, command line, and Spark SQL skills

* Watching Andrew Ng's machine learning course lectures to get additional mathematical depth on foundational DS methods

* Listening to informative, educational podcasts to get different perspectives and analogies on DS methods (data skeptic, TWiML, etc)

What I really need are some crash courses to get me ramped up as quickly as possible on the gaps I have for the jobs that will be posted in a few months (read March or April). Some barriers I am facing currently include my current, full time job being fairly demanding with not much free time day-to-day, I have a two year old at home so I spend a good portion of my evenings and most of the day on weekends spending time with her (except nap times and after bed time). I understand this is probably not all achievable, but I want to prioritize what I can and at minimum show a good faith effort that I can close these gaps quickly.

Thoughts, advice, and resource recommendations welcome. Feel free to be as brutally honest as possible so I can temper my expectations.

P.S. Incase it's relevant I already have the O'Reilly data science book series (November humble bundle) sidelined in my desk drawer just haven't had time to pick them up yet. Part of that includes a text on H2O, several on python for data science, and a Bayesian methods text with python being the code used within.

Edit: Per /u/Stochastic_Response I will include a bit more about my experience / background. My education is a bit unconventional, with an MS in Industrial-Organizational Psychology (has a heavy emphasis on statistical and research methods). Working experience has been HR and People Analytics focused, where I spend a lot of time automating processes and incorporating statistical analyses for deeper insights. I recently partnered cross functionally to produce an economic analysis for my company, looking at macroeconomic drivers of company performance. I've spent time learning new statistical and ML methods via the ISLR, Andrew Ng's ML course, and some other texts on these topics.  I have a pretty shallow background in computer science, admittedly.

As for free time it's pretty minimal. Could probably commit 30 minutes to 1 hour at work max per day and 1 to 2 hours max per day at home.

For my company, I'll keep it brief and just say it's a large company creating a data science team for the first time. They have very few internal folks who understand statistics and fewer who use it in their role. While the DS team is just getting started they are aggressively investing in these types of resources. Topics I've been told would be used: 

* Deep Learning
* NLP
* Bayesian methods
* Run off the mill stuff (regression, clustering, decision trees)",7,15

I'm starting with a mostly numeric data set with 4 categorical features (for which I've used OHE to turn into numeric data). The total number of features is about 60, the total number of observations in my training set is about 3,000. I'm primarily doing data analysis, munging, and trial regression models in some jupyter notebooks running Python 3, and am enjoying looking carefully at various regression models for my data. (Most of my training material focused on categorization algorithms, so the numeric predictions are nice and juicy drilldowns into less familiar territory to fill out my training.)

I have about 1.5 years of early data science work under my belt from grad school in the late 90s. I didn't complete the PhD but it was in Physical Chemistry, and my research - through a research fellowship - was building instrument prototypes, using early data science methods to do least squares fitting regressions against experimental data in a very well characterized system - with 15 - 21 coefficients, depending on experimental setup. (For more info, see keywords ""plasmon spectroscopy"", ""polarized light"", ""reflection values"" and computational and fitting work with complex numbers in double precision. At the time I could only use FORTRAN or Matlab to do the coding - no other language natively supported calculations with both complex numbers and double precision.)

My main question that my current project work is stimulating for me is: am I correct in thinking that the main difference between my postgraduate work and my current work is the regressions I can reasonably do for a system of unknown dynamic versus those I can do with a well known and well-characterized system? Part of the analysis/regression work I have to do with the current data is to let the computer figure out the best equation, according to the regression model's kernel and coding, right?

Also, I know the general work plan this time around is to evaluate and test the various regression models I'm playing with for my project, but do you have a sort of systematic workflow for starting with a data set  for which specific dynamics are unknown and the goal is making a numerical prediction model? I'm also wondering if it's considered worth it to take a wild stab at a formula for such a data set and use any of the fitting regressions that use non-linear fitting goals/functions.

For me, I did some data munging, analysis, carried out various attempts to find good patterns/correlations in the data, and cleaned the data up, then moved on to some simple regression models and fiddled around with them and different normalizations of the data set, explored some feature selection algorithms, then started drilling into more and more complex and configurable regression models in sklearn, and am currently noodling with random forest regression and gradient boosting regression to find some favorable parameters. I may also explore some feature reduction methods and more data transformations. Next I plan to move on to some of the other libraries I've read about here and noodle around there before finally moving on to various neural network options, if I'm still not satisfied with my predicted results by the time I run out of other options.

I have been learning Spark and am already familiar with Python and Flask. I don't want to be shown a solution. I just need to know what the deliverables are. Here is the project description: 

-----

*Use a generator script to create a csv file with the following format,*

    patient_id, age, cancer_type, genetic sequence 

*The genetic sequence is just a long string of 0s and 1s indicating whether a gene is mutated (1) or not (0). Ideally the pipeline could handle a genetic sequence that is a 20,000 long string of 0s and 1s but for simplicity in the beginning stages I am only printing out a 1000 long sequence for testing.*

*The final pipeline must run on at least 500GB - 1TB of data.*



*Use Spark to find identical gene sets and return the sorted counts of what cancer type was associated with that set of genes. So for instance, taking lines of input from the csv files,*

    15, 23, lung, 011010101000110
    16, 32, pancreas, 010111010110100
    17, 76, skin, 101011010001111

*The spark program should batch process the entire dataset in spark and look for various gene sets and return information. So say we want to see what cancer types are associated with the gene set where*
    {gene[2] = 1, gene[5] = 1, gene[15] = 0}, 
*the spark batch process should return the sorted counts of the diseases associated with that set, so something like this*

    lung 1
    pancreas 1

*This data should then be accessible for querying, so that I can query for the set from before {gene[2] = 1, gene[5] = 1, gene[15] = 0} and get the disease count back in a Flask front-end web page*

From my understanding, this is what i think it is but i need confirmation before i go on a tangent:

1) Build a generator script that has the data in the format provided and dump it in a csv format in an AWS S3 bucket. 

2) Write a batch processor that processes the .csv generated in 1 and outputs results.

3) Have a Flask app where the user can query the results of 2 and display them on a web page.


-----

**What I have done so far:**

- I have built the generator script. I take it this is the one that is supposed to generate the 500GB csv file.

- I have set up a basic  Spark installation instance in EC2 that has access to the S3 bucket containing the csv generated in the first step.

- I have setup a barebones Flask App on EC2 to build upon the front end.

**HERE ARE MY QUESTIONS NOW**

1) What is the batch processor script actually doing? What is the is the output of from the processing? What is the technique that i should learn to carry out the processing? I am failing to understand that part. 

2) The output of 1, should that be stored in a database then accessed by the Flask app or I am sending it directly sending it to the Flask app? If another intermediary database is needed, what would be a good choice? DynamoDB?

3) What is the user actually querying from the front end? What are they typing into the search box and what are they supposed to get back? This is confusing me.

Any help whatsoever would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!",4,3

I am currently working with data where there is roughly a 9:1 imbalance of one class. I have attempted the following methods:

* I used stratified kfolds to create 5 folds in my data. I was led to believe that this would help my model by balancing the data in each fold. Instead it gives as close a representation to the real data within the folds as possible. This led to my model not predicting the minority class when testing.

*  I attempted to manually balance the data and split it. Essentially I took samples of the majority class that were equal in size to the minority class and made 9 dataframes where there was a 1:1 ratio of both classes. When I trained the model on this split, the confusion matrices showed no heterogeneity. It either predicted all yes or all no.

The algorithm I am using is RandomForest from scikit-learn and I am initializing it with the following parameters:

RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500,n_jobs=-1,min_samples_leaf=50)

Here's another one:

&gt; Look up NFL suicide rates compared to other career paths.

And another:

&gt; If football caused suicide and mental illness the rate would be on par with the military and law enforcement.


I feel like all of these takes are not fully fleshed out and reductive, potentially just flat out wrong. For starters, suicide isn't the only marker of people who have CTE. But it seems like there is more to it.

Random Forest, SVM (obviously) and hell even GLMs aren't running on this thing without crashing R for me.

Lastly I tried running a bigglm on this but it's super-buggy and even with exactly the right data types I still get ""not optimal for factors"" or ""na/nan/inf in argument"" errors that piss me off.

And, a bigger issue, I'm not entirely sure what sort of role I should be looking for (i.e. don't know what I am qualified for)

Here is my background/current knowledge base: 

* **Education** - BS and MS in Biology. Focus was in Behavioral Ecology (i.e. animal behavior), graduate thesis was on incubation behavior. 

* **Statistics** - Learned in grad school where we were taught SAS. In my current role, I'm using pretty basic statistics: linear and logistic regression, occasionally a t-test or a simple ANOVA. But I'm have a lot more experience from grad school on mixed-model glms and some non-linear modeling. 

* **Data Querying** - Learn SQL on the job and use it daily. Pretty confident in my ability to construct large and complex queries, but I don't have any experience database management, creating tables, creating functions, or using the insert statement. 

* **R Programming** - Switched from SAS to R, after a year on the job. Took a couple of MOOCs to get used to the language. Confident in my importing, cleaning, and manipulating skills (RODBC and tidyverse). Also pretty confident on the analysis/stats side of things. Feel good about programing skills as well (loops, building functions, parallel computing), but don't have as much experience with those. 

* **Machine Learning** - Worked through Intro to Statistical Learning and Andrew Ng's coursea course on ML. Understand the basic concepts of ML and built a simple classification model to predict which applicants will enroll for the work (used for planning) using tree based methods, but not a lot of first-hand experience building more complex methods. 

* **Data Viz** - For static charts/tables I'm currently using R (ggplot2 and xtables), was just using excel beforehand. For interactive figures/tables, I'm using Tableau, which I learned from work. Not a pro, but I'm the only person that works with Tableau some I am becoming a lot better.

* **Spatial Data** - Was taught ArcGIS in grad school. I'm not a GIS pro, but - again - I am definitely competent in the basics and can do a few of the more complex things that I have experience with. Currently, I working on learning how to work with spatial data in R, so that I can get away from ArcGIS though. 

* **Other/Misc** - I'm currently working on a social network analysis project for work, that should be pretty neat (done in R). I'm also built a few web-scrapers in R for side projects. 

I think that's it. ",2,8

 With data scientists in high demand, lots of training programs have started up to help people learn the skills necessary to enter the profession. Im guessing many of you may have made a New Years resolution to learn/improve your data science skills, and thought a post identifying the numerous programs would be helpful. I spent a fair amount of time in 2017 researching the various data science training programs available and have categorized these programs by price, payment structure (flat fee, subscription, per class), and curriculum (structured vs ala carte). Please keep in mind I am not ranking these training programs, just categorizing them.

Data Science Training Programs

Gateway Drugs: Free, ala Carte Courses
These programs allow you to select and take free data science courses. Kaggles kernels are very useful for picking up specific data science skills, whereas Data 36 provides more generalized courses. Both provide an easy way to get a basic familiarization with data science skills and Kaggle is great for picking up specific skills. Udacity actually uses their courses as a gateway to their paid nanodegree programs and you can take quite a bit of the content for free.

Enter the Dojo: Free Training Programs with Structured Curriculum
Two variations of the free program with structured curriculum are available. The first Ill cover is general introduction to data science programs. These include Allison, Future Learn, edX, and Cognitive Class. All provide a structured sequence of courses you can take to learn various aspects of statistical analysis programming. Future Learn and edX charge for certifying completion of their programs, but otherwise is free. The second type is programs like Insight and Data Incubator target, which are for science Ph.D.s transitioning from their fields into data science. Both offer highly intensive data science boot camps to build on the statistical skills acquired in a Ph.D. program. Both programs then serve as recruiters placing their students with companies. They make their money on the program from the recruiter fees (remember if its free, youre the product). Cool win/win idea for recovering academics.

Training Buffets: Pay per Course
Several programs allow you to select data science training courses and pay per course. These programs often have a large catalog of courses and are reasonably priced ($7 - $10 per course). Data Oragami, Udemy, and some Udacity content are available on a per course basis. Good way to try a few classes to see if data science is right for you or pick up some specific skills. Dataversity also follows this model, but at a much higher price point ($79 - $129 per course). District Data Labs also offers a premium offering focused on corporate training ($25 per participant).

 Subscribe Now! Structured Curriculum with Paid Subscription
These data science training programs provide a structured curriculum with multiple learning paths for a low monthly rate. Coursera, Data Camp, Dataquest, Lynda, and OReilly all follow this model and offer monthly subscriptions from $25 to $50 a month. These programs incentivize you to hustle since you can learn at your own pace and the faster you move through the content, the less you pay. Data Camp and Dataquest appear to be some of the more popular in the data science community.

Old School: Structured Curriculum with Upfront Tuition
Not surprisingly, this old school model is the most prevalent way to offer data science training. Udacity is perhaps the king of this space offering the best value with good content in a structured course sequence ($499 - $699). The price goes up from there from $699 (Simplilearn Data Science) to $8500 (Thinkful). Brain Station, General Assembly, K2 Data Science, Springboard, and The Institute for Statistics Education all fall somewhere between these two price points. These programs typically differentiate themselves from the Subscribe Now! programs by offering one-on-one mentors that can help you through the program. If the one-on-one matters to you, this is the way to go. Otherwise, I did not see a lot of difference between the tuition and subscription based models. In fact, Springboard actually uses Data Camps content.

I do not have university courses identified here. If youve got plenty of time and money to burn, check out this dataset listing all [university data science programs](https://www.kaggle.com/sriharirao/datascience-universities-across-us).

I am about to graduate in the Spring with a degree in Stats and Math, but because I switched around degrees a lot I havent had the chance to really build up much of a portfolio full of projects (for reference, I literally added my stats major last semester and after an introductory machine learning course, introductory data science course, and applied regression, Im done!). I have developed some skills in the languages at the bottom of this post, but its mostly just enough to do basic to intermediate level programming work (stuff you would get from a classroom, with some of it being from my research).


Although I am currently improving these skills through some of my classes, and I am going to try doing some projects, I would also like to develop some skills in related tools that are easy or quick to pick up but would look nice on a resume. Anything that might take a few weeks or so to pick up, use, and be able to say at a job interview.


Before listing, I know a lot of people are going to comment just pick up a project on something and figure out the stuff you need along the way, and I whole-heartedly agree this is the best way to solidify skills and truly say youre experienced in something, but given my limited time frame before I graduate and how I would like to start looking for jobs, Im looking for any suggestions of tools you see a lot in the field or that you really believe might be helpful.


To make this post useful for people who are also looking for something similar, Ill list out some of the stuff I use and know, and you can look them up to see if they might fit your needs too:


Python - comfortable doing some stuff with Numpy, pandas, SQLite, really basic BeautifulSoup, a tiny amount of Flask (but I was thinking of picking up more). Usually used at command line but I also use Jupyter Notebooks and Rodeo (which makes Python look like RStudio).

R - caret, cars, faraway (which i know is more educational related but still), some ggplot, and of course the wonderful RStudio.

SQL - Only really SQLite and SAS (proc SQL), and Ive done some HackerRank/LeetCode problems, but I dont really know how to actually use it I guess in my own opinion.

C# - Unity. I have 0 experience with .NET and havent looked into it too much. I use Unity to build simulations and then Math.NET library to build some of the machine learning components.

I also know some of the following, but basically enough to get by in 70% of situations - Shell (gonna try and become a grep god later), Git (push and rm *), SVN (same as git)


What Im learning this semester in classes - Hadoop, Hive, Pig, OpenBUGS, Scikit-learn, SciPy, more SQLite.


Lemme know if you have any suggestions, and thanks in advance! :)",3,0

But if you plan to do mostly statistics, you may be better off learning a different language that's built specifically for that._

I then realized what I want to do is look at what training methods, parameters etc affect athletes and their performance and what kind of training loads can they tolerate etc.

With this in mind would you suggest goign down more of the statistics and R kind of path or the python path. I thought Python may help give me a skill to fall back on (or help market myself better when lookign for work) In saying that I don't want to be a programmer per se",2,1

I have a qualifying exam coming up. I don't really know what's gonna be in it. I recently finished the Python course from codecademy.com, and am struggling to decide what to do start next. Should I review my math( linear algebra, advanced algebra, matrices?), study about statistics( we had ""probability and statistics"" but it was 90% about probability and 10% basic statistics) or learn another programming language?  

I'm really overwhelmed at the moment and am getting stuck. Learning what a data scientist do and getting excited while learning Python brought back a spark I didn't even notice I lost. I want to increase my chances to be accepted and even if I may not qualify for it now, I know this is the field I would want to be pursuing.

I haven't done a ton of these before, but I think I stumbled upon something today that lifted my train test split AUC from .82 to .92 (I change the random state every time I make significant changes to the features). 

However, what I noticed was that the probability distribution had an insane shift. It went from essentially a slow slope starting with about 40% of the test set having a probability of about zero to now with the train test split AUC of .92 about 88% of the test set has a probability of about zero. The real distribution in the data (I'm assuming the target was split equally across training, test, and holdout) should be roughly an 82/18 split, with 18 being the target. 

Is this normal when the AUC moves towards 1? I haven't worked with AUC a lot in the past. I'm reading up on it, but I thought I'd get some other opinions. ",9,2

I've been pretty lucky getting to where I am through meeting the right people at the right time and then letting me develop on job as an engineer. My educational background is a MS in economics. 

About a year ago I was recruited by a financial company who wanted to double my salary, so of course I took it. Problem is, a pretty toxic workplace has developed and I don't like being here. I want to leave for hopefully at a big N company. My partner has about a year left in her masters program and I am sort of geographically constrained until then. I've been accepted into a few MS CS programs around here and can finish within that year or maybe 3 semesters. In school I want to really hammer down CS fundamentals and work on some open source projects plus take some time off for travel before school starts. 

I am a little bit worried this will hurt my career and I might not be able to pick up where I left off. Would I get lumped in with everyone else finishing a degree program who have no real experience?

Other than a training course I did in R during my uni studies I really have no experience in the field though.

After leaving a pretty depressing job recently I found a Data Analysis Apprenticeship role being advertised online with a decent employer. The online application required me to do a math and critical thinking test (roughly high school level). I ended up timing out of questions and I'm sure I got several wrong (distractions got in the way, welp). I was absolutely *100%* sure that I had crashed it, but somehow I got invited to an interview.

What now? I assume (perhaps wrongly) that I'm a bit highly educated for this apprenticeship. I've been told to bring along records of high school results, and I have an advanced masters degree in a STEM subject. The interview will also consist of an analysis exercise. What sort of knowledge should I go in with, other than what I can bring from my previous employment.

For those unfamiliar: It's basically a CS degree combined with a stats degree, except specifically tailored toward analyzing data. OSU is treating it as a selective major and is investing in it; it's not just bullshit. They take the same CS classes as CS majors and the Stats classes not only teach the theoretical foundations of statistics, but also how it applies to big data, and tools such as R are used to manipulate and analyze data. 

My main concern is people outside of Columbus/Ohio being unfamiliar with it, which is why I'm thinking about the double major instead.

The Data science guys advise SQL, Python and R, all of which I have a (very) firm grasp of (ok, maybe not R, only used it for like 6 months).  

The BI/BA guys talk about SQL, Python and PowerBi. No Idea what the last one is, honestly; apparently it's used for visualization.  

The ML guys are all about python and R.. but a ton more math. I've been going through the ESL text book for a while now and the math part is very clearly going to be the hardest part.  

Now my question. The reason I want to learn all this is because I want to start my own shop. There's going going to be a proper surge in the focus on data in the coming years I figure, so might as well take a dip. In my experience, even if I have to employ others, there's no way I'll take on a project I couldn't handle myself if the other guy flakes, quits, etc.  

The individual technologies, I could learn; **I now need a resource to understand the whys and hows. The methodologies, so to speak.** As for ML, I'll never really want to go beyond basic random forests and maybe NNs. For everything else, I'll want to learn as much as possible.

The majority of my work experience is in more BI analytics, creating dashboards, web, app and database analysis. Use of SQL, Spreadshets and sometimes Javascript for setting up tracking.

In 2014 I started learning how to use R and completed the Coursera MOOC with Andrew Ng. Then, in 2015 I completed a certificate [""Big Data and Advanced Analytics""](https://ce-online.ryerson.ca/ce/default.aspx?id=3635) course in Toronto. 

Since then I've been freelancing, mostly in web tracking and reporting, however I've completed several data science projects including:

*  Statistical modeling for a content site trying to understand which types of articles lead to higher engagement (time on page)

*  Classifying text reports into categories. NLP and clustering to generate labels then XGB to classify.

*  NLP + clustering to understand text responses  of users cancelling from a SaaS service.

*  Hypothesis testing in several contexts. E.g. Choosing a new email sequence over the original, does the new sequence lead to more paying customers. 

Among a handful of other projects. 

While I might not be a particularly advanced user, I have a reasonably good understanding of when to use which method (Classification, Regression, Clustering).

I'm also reasonably confident in using R. I wrangle data a lot using R, often in exploratory analysis that might not even use ""advanced analytics"" such as the methods mentioned above, instead focusing on grouping data and generating some bar charts or a trendline.

I've also built some shiny apps (Marketing dashboards).

I have a foundational knowledge of statistics, including probability, inference and regression. I have not yet looked much at Bayesian stats but it's on my list and I'm aware it's important.

Can I call myself a data scientist?

My confidence is being hammered. I've applied to countless jobs over the past 3 months and while most just ignore me, I've noticed a common theme in those who do respond - I don't have enough relevant experience. I'm confident I could land a BI job very fast, I get a lot of Linkedin messages asking if I'm interested in positions along the lines of managing a web analytics team who use Tableau for reporting. It just doesn't appeal to me any more, data science is fulfilling and a new frontier in advancing my understanding.

I've tried applying for intern or junior data scientist positions, should I do that or should I try to sell myself into a mid level position?

I'm applying to jobs on Linkedin, Indeed and a few niche sites. I do this daily, I apply for at least one job each day with a tailored, unique cover letter and I spend anywhere between 30 minutes to a couple of hours wordsmithing it. 

I'm tri national and apply to jobs in the USA, Canada and UK, but still cannot get an interview.

At this point I'm thinking there's something fundamentally flawed in my approach. I've done everything by the book - got some formal education in advanced analytics, completed several projects and carefully applied for so many positions.

What else can I do. This is a general distress call.",22,2

My experience with SQL has been limited to things like SQLZoo and the likes. I'm quite comfortable with the usual data structure/algo questions, and I would probably I'm at a Leetcode-Medium level, if that means anything.

Ideally, I'd like a more research-based job (since I figured I'm more adept to that), but really just looking for a job that allows me to learn more. What can I do improve my resume and excel in this field? How do I get companies to give me a chance?

Should I try to participate in Kaggle competitions until I get better than top 10%? I've played with their data sets but haven't competed yet. Between writing my thesis and learning, not sure how much time I can spend to do really well on a kaggle competition.

Should I type up solutions to ESL? I've LaTeX'd solutions to a good chunk of problems from chapters 2 and 3, and I could be compelled to do the same for the others, though not sure employers would care about this.

A lot of the interesting jobs (e.g. Spotify) seem to only want machine learning phds published in prestigious ML journal. Would the fact that I published in top math journals be an acceptable substitute? (probably not, but a man can wish! )

The first pays 10,000 less than the second, but also offers equity and bonus.

I definitely want to go into data science/ML and have a master's degree in a relevant discipline from a top uni, so the only doubt I have is: would it be a wiser choice to get some experience in the IB first and then transition into more senior data science roles with a higher salary, or is the startup experience a better starting point?

I might have the chance to work in data science at the bank too, but since it's a generic tech graduate programme and it involves rotations, I'm not guaranteed to be placed in exactly the team I want and I know I'd get bored easily and feel frustrated if the work turns out to be dull.

The Course; https://www.cct.ie/our-courses/part-time/diploma-in-predictive-data-analytics/




Pros:

-Get better help and understanding from teachers.
-Ask for help and advice for personal projects.
-Get more homework projects on the subject.


Cons;

-Could be more expansive than online courses.
-Small colleges may often be more interested in making money than offering good quality material.

I do have a large interest in mathematics, and did a double major with EE in mathematics. I loved theoretical math such as complex/real analysis, introduction to proofs, etc. 

I was thinking maybe a graduate degree at my school can help me acquire the skills needed but I want to get away from the academia BS and find a grd program that can help me hone in on important skills to be a competitive edge in industry.

Here are three grad programs from my school:
http://engineering.buffalo.edu/content/dam/engineering/computer-science-engineering/docs/graduate/handbooks/grad-handbook-2016.pdf

The first programs focuses largely on AI which is interesting but also on CS fundamentals.

https://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/academics/grad/engineering-sciences.html
The second program is tailored towards future data scientist. It has a reasonable mix between CS and Math 

The third program is completely math based:
https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/grad/master-program/focus.html

I can use the third degree to hone in on the important stastical and mathematics concepts and have a competitive academia advantage in industry. it also has courses I am interest in as well. 


Which one would help me get into a role that makes the big $$$.

It's written by a data scientist at AirBnb. 

&gt; The more experienced I become as a data scientist, the more convinced I am that data engineering is one of the most critical and foundational skills in any data scientists toolkit. I find this to be true for both evaluating project or job opportunities and scaling ones work on the job.

&gt; In an earlier post, I pointed out that a data scientists capability to convert data into value is largely correlated with the stage of her companys data infrastructure as well as how mature its data warehouse is. This means that a data scientist should know enough about data engineering to carefully evaluate how her skills are aligned with the stage and need of the company. Furthermore, many of the great data scientists I know are not only strong in data science but are also strategic in leveraging data engineering as an adjacent discipline to take on larger and more ambitious projects that are otherwise not reachable.

&gt; Despite its importance, education in data engineering has been limited. Given its nascency, in many ways the only feasible path to get training in data engineering is to learn on the job, and it can sometimes be too late. I am very fortunate to have worked with data engineers who patiently taught me this subject, but not everyone has the same opportunity. As a result, I have written up this beginners guide to summarize what I learned to help bridge the gap.

I think many of us in the field feel the same way. Are there any good books or courses that cover data engineering as defined by the article above? Which technologies are most widely used in industry? ",11,48

Their syllabus includes Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing &amp; Sentiment Analysis, Recommender Systems, Big Data with Spark &amp; Splunk, Deep Learning and Time Series, and Computer Vision with Open CV. Their Project Based Learning includes applying Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining(CRISP-DM), and  End to End Development where students take a new project from start to finish.  It says it will allow students to demonstrate their skills in data acquisition, data cleaning, data enrichment, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. 

I've taken a look at some of the machine learning material and to be honest I didn't find the sample material too difficult in terms of math. I've had times in upper division physics where I just had no idea what I just read or saw and just felt dumb. However, with this material it doesn't seem mathematically hard but perhaps logically hard. 

I want to know with this kind of background is it realistic for me to get a job within this year as a Data Scientist? I've seen a lot of Indeed job postings that require Masters or PhD which kinda makes me feel discouraged, especially when they're looking for years of experience on top of that. With an Astrophysics background, and learning all the skills that hopefully are used by Data Scientists in real life, is it feasible for me to get a 100K Data Scienist job within this year? Or would I be relegated to some type of Junior Analyst or Junior Data Scientist (if there is one) with pay much less that what I'm looking for? If it's a Junior Data Scientist position where I can gain experience and move up to Senior position, I'll be up for it to get experience.

I know this is a long post. Sorry but I wanted to give the exact situation I'm in so I can get some honest feedback or advice. Anything would be appreciated. I'm a plane with fuel ready to take off and looking for a destination worth while going. 

TLDR: Went back to school to get my Astrophysics degree couple of years ago. Was in Real Estate before that but I was science oriented all my life. Learning Python and looking to be in a bootcamp for Data Scientist. I want to know if it's realistic for me to get a job as Data Scientist this year without advanced degree and years of experience if I learn everything they do?",13,4

I have no programming experience or linear algebra knowledge, although I am currently learning using online resources. But I am not spending as much time as I want to because of demands of my final year.

I am due to graduate in the summer and I am a bit unsure how to proceed. Ideally I would like to do an MSc on the topic as I think I would benefit from a structured learning environment. Although I am a bit worried if it will be worth my time because many other sources have suggested getting an MSc is not that important and you can learn everything at the fraction of the cost online. Money is not really an issue because MSc courses in the UK are around 9000 approx $13,000.
One thing I am a bit concerned with is that most reputable universities require coding skills and knowledge of university level maths (I don't have sufficient knowledge of this). So there really isn't a guarantee that I will get onto these programmes.

The other option is to go into full time self directed study of data science after I graduate.  I am a bit weary of this because I am unsure where to begin and how long it will take me to get sufficient knowledge. And also it is a bit scary thinking about graduating without a job living at home.

I guess I could work, doing a grad scheme I am not very interested in and study data science when I get the time. But for me this is the least desirable option.

I'm not in a true data science role myself so am seeking some advice from those that are. In my organisation we have multiple datasets from which we build numerous models. In turn, these models are implemented in software systems to produce further data and information for operational use. These systems may take numerous other data sources, or specifications as input. The datasets and models derived from them are being frequently updated and improved. I'm sure this is not an unusual scenario.

The dependencies between datasets, models, systems and other inputs are becoming complex and difficult to manage. Do you have any recommendations for systems to document, manage and possibly visualise these dependencies? I.e. I'd love to be able to select an artifact and view all others that may be affected by its change. I'm hoping for something which can be applied business-wide, and is a bit more intelligent than a simple diagram.

In the worst case scenario I can rig something up myself, however would like to see if there are any off-the-shelf solutions first. Thank you.",8,13

I graduated in October 2017 with a Ph.D. in Physics.  I'm trying to get a data science position, but I haven't been getting many callbacks.  At this point, I assume it must be either my resume or cover letter.  Let's start with the cover letter.  What I have right now is basically [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0bra7nvp515vp3z/coverLetter_reddit.pdf?dl=0).

On a whim, for an application I did last night, I used this for my cover letter:

&gt;Thank you very much for taking the time to evaluate my resume. While I do not currently have any strict ""industry"" experience with data science, as you can see from my resume, I recently finished a Ph.D. in Physics. This has given me years of experience with coding in Python and C++, using machine learning techniques such as boosted decision trees to classify data, and employing a wide array of statistical methods. In addition, my Ph.D. work has given me an intuition for what questions to ask of data. As part of ExperimentName, I have collaborated on analysis work with an international team and mentored many students. I believe I have the skills and approach necessary to be a successful data scientist, and I would very much like the opportunity to demonstrate that to you in an interview.

Right now everything (data entry, data storage, and reporting) is in excel and I'm desperate to move our data into a more secure place and move our reports to a more... reliable tool.

We have a tableau license and I am pretty good with R. We contracted with someone to build us a SQL database but I wasn't with the company at the time so my programs will not be well-covered by this database when it FINALLY goes live.

I have run into shortcomings with both access and tableau. For Access, I need to calculate some values (scoring outcomes measures) but there are character limits on the expressions in Access. In tableau there is less functionality in developing expressions and some of our data will be a bit challenging to present. At least, if I use tableau, I'll have to present the data in a different way and these reports haven't changed much in the last 5 years, so it would be a big deal to change them.


Right now these are the options I'm considering:

1) Data entry and storage in Access, calculations in R that are then saved into access, and reports in Tableau

2) Data entry and storage in Access, calculations in R, and static reporting in R (can R Shiny produce static PDF reports?)


3) Data entry and storage in Access, calculations in R, and reporting in Excel.


Option 2 is my preference if possible, the only downside is that I think doing anything too complex in R could create problems when I leave. It would be harder to find a replacement who understands how all of these programs work.

Hey everyone, currently a Ph.D. candidate in biology (R1 research university in the SE US) graduating in May looking to transition to analytical roles in industry. My goal is to work as a data scientist but I'm open to the idea of working as an analyst for a few years to gain more hands-on experience outside of academia.

All of my analytical work is done in R, I am currently learning Python and SQL through a couple personal projects. My math background is a little sparse - I took calc and stats in undergraduate, biometry (based on Andy Fields' Learning Statistics Using R), and bioinformatics (overview course) in graduate school. I utilize some linear algebra in my analyses and some light bioinformatics, but nothing rigorous.

I've been very impressed with the time and effort this subreddit gives to people looking for advice and I'd love to hear feedback on how to best present my experience to industry roles. I've also noticed that many here (though not all) seem to have math/CS/physics backgrounds. Is a life sciences degree more difficult to sell to industry? Thank you guys in advance for your time.",6,5

[Updated Resume](https://i.imgur.com/03YSbc1.png)

A few notes of my own:

* I'm firmly in the entry level camp, but seeking opportunities where I'd have more contact with production rather than just reporting.
* I've noticed conflicting opinions on how much detail to include in a skills section, and subsequently how much of that detail should be redundant in an experience section. 
* I have a few self-directed projects I'm working on to replace the Kaggle competitions I have noted, to provide more evidence of business acumen and statistical reasoning rather than just the ability to implement ML models.
* I work through MOOCs regularly but don't feel comfortable listing the topics as ""skills"" since I haven't utilized them in a work environment, and I intend to enroll in a M.S. program in the next year or two. Is there a way to communicate this as evidence of continuous learning, or is this expected of everyone these days?

I hope I've addressed some of the immediate concerns, but of course the idea is to distill them into the resume. Once again, any feedback is much appreciated. If anything is too unclear due to anonymizing my resume, please let me know and I can clarify.

I work at a Federally Qualified Health Center as a Data Analyst coming up on 3 years now and my boss has asked me to suggest a new title. This is part of a restructure of the team that currently only has 2 of 4 positions staffed and difficulty hiring due to low salaries, as a small-medium sized non-profit.

The difficulty in coming up with a new job title is in the variety of the work I do (warehouse architecture/development, requirements gathering, data analysis, report writing, quality council work, infrastructure setup and maintenance, etc).

A little bit about me and my contributions. I had no experience in data when I started but have had several big 'wins'. I built a data warehouse from a single T-SQL script with SELECT INTO statements to a concurrently extracting, high performance dimensional data warehouse. I performed 85/95% of the work and vision on two projects that were recognized by our federal auditors as FQHC best practices. I also have discovered security vulnerabilities in operational systems that triggered projects to replace them with more secured systems. Education wise I have a BS in Computer Science and I completed the Stanford AI-Class.com course in the top 99% of students.

My long term goals are driving towards data science but I still lack the practical machine learning and predictive analytics skills and practice. While I feel like I could suggest almost any title within reason and have it considered, I'm hesitant to go with something that might set me up for failure so soon. I was pretty partial to going with a Data Engineer title, but a consultant I highly respect suggested something like Senior Data Analyst since it would be more in line with Data Scientist in the future and the idea is growing on me.

The biggest requirement that was handed down to me is that it has to be market review-able, so nothing too out of the mainstream. Any thoughts/advice?",17,5

669,2018-1-31,2018,1,31,17,7u8he7,Approach for text-based product matching?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7u8he7/approach_for_textbased_product_matching/,sockevalley,1517386962,"Hey guys. 

I'm working on a project where I aproximately got 1.500000 uncategorized articles/products and around 3500 matched base products that I can use as training and test data. The data consists of textual descriptions, titles and unique identifiers. However, they are not always reliable in this case unfortunately.

The goal is to build a model that learns which category each product belongs to. Today this is done manually by classifying each entry by hand. So by telling the model if a classification is correct or not it should therefore learn and speed up this classification problem.

I started of looking into reinforced neural networks but that field seems to be using neural networks for games etc. All resources that I found (not scanned all google pages yet) seemed to consist of learning a car to drive in a circle etc.

However, before posting this I made some [reddit research ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3b48zp/how_to_do_product_matching/) and heard for the first time of the field of [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) which sounds precisely like the thing I'm looking for. 
I also just found that google has a [playground](https://github.com/google/active-learning) for this as well. 

Just before I found this wikipedia page, I had the idea that you could use a simple classification method, naive bayes or SVM for instance. The idea was to train the model on the exisiting data, let the model classifiy one entry, if wrong put the entry back to the pile of unlabeled data. If next entry is correct train the exisiting model on the data. The downside with this is that the model only get rewarded in learning new entry but not pentalized when classiyifying wrong. But it's something!

What are your suggestions?
