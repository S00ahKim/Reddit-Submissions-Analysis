I cannot say specifically what the dataset is (confidentiality), but I can describe certain aspects of it.

The data comes to me in the form of a CSV file. It has a column heading and a row heading. I will refer to the regular values as a 'report' (i.e. reported value).

The reports consist of stuff like speeds, angles, and temperature of certain instruments and the specific instrument and type of report is derived from the column heading, and the time is in the row heading. 

Something a little bit more specific about the column heading is that it is encoded in such a way as to provide the instrument site, what property it is reporting (for example a speed), and sometimes which instance. So for example it might be the temperature of instrument 89 instance 1 (and another could be the exact same, but instance 2).

The quantity of data I have totals about 50GB, with a common file size being 150mb (there are a total of nearly a thousand files, but some earlier ones are smaller). A few years of data are represented, many times that reports are coming every second.

Presently what I am trying to do is parse the CSV, and generate SQL commands to load it into postgres. 

The kinds of queries I would be running initially concern certain data properties, such as the speed of instruments from time1 to time2. Others would require post-processing, such as the speed of the instrument from time1 to time2 and place the speeds into buckets with a width of 3km/h. Its these kinds of queries that have led me into something like SQL. 

The hardware I am running on are regular servers, but categorically not a cluster.

My main concerns are that I might (more likely **will**) end up with billions of rows, which I expect would not necessarily be very good processing speed. I am very new to this kind of processing, and we are looking for possible thesis material in this project (haven't identified anything in particular right now). 

The openness of this project is a little disconcerting, but at this early stage is easy enough to deal with. 

I am open to nosql solutions should they make sense, or even another storage method entirely.

Any thoughts would be welcome.

I work for a municipality, and some of my colleagues said that when our department of public works mills and paves roads, the machine that mills the road vibrates the ground so much that it can break the water mains a few feet down. After being on site when a road was milled, I became skeptical, and figured I could test the hypothesis.

I have a dataset of all the road pavings that have happened in the last 10 years, as well as a data set of all the water main breaks. I can visualize both of them on the same map, but I can't join the two data sets together to isolate just those instances where a road paving and a water main break happened within the same area within a year or so of each other. 

Generally I would just do a SQL join, but since I don't have primary keys, or any consistent business keys, the only normalized data is latlong. Not sure how to join these together if they are similar, but not exactly the same. 

Would love any recommendations in SQL, R, or Python.

12,datascience,t5_2sptq,2015-10-2,2015,10,2,23,3n879z,self.datascience,A summary of some a recent Data Scientist hiring process - resumes and interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3n879z/a_summary_of_some_a_recent_data_scientist_hiring/,kindasortadata,1443794592,"There seems to be some interest here to hear from hiring managers about the employment side of the equation.

I have literally ( about 5 minutes ago ) taken on two new junior positions - I thought I would cover off some interviews for you guys - I saw a lot of themes.

Some background:

* Role is for a junior role on lowish pay - my expectation is that this person will progress over the next 2-3 years to eventually be on 4x - 5x their salary.

* Role is a mixture of coding and true data science, with a preference for someone with a machine learning background - although wasn't considered mandatory.

* I have a strict policy of specifically not recruiting anyone with a MSc or PhD in Statistics ( and I'm not alone in this - lots of managers of Data Science teams use Stats as a specific exclusion - flip side is that some consider it mandatory ). Stats people are very bright, but their professors in general let them down very badly - they aren't taught flexibility, and not taught a lot of valuable skills and so always seem to struggle in the real world.

For context - the majority of people who were applying had not had a private sector job before - most were either straight out from their courses, or had been doing Grad Assistant type work for a while. 

***Resumes***

I have 47 unique resumes from 3 different recruitment agents. The majority where Grads and Post-Docs with STEM related degrees who said in their intro that they wanted to do ""Data Science and Stuff""

These got whittled down from 47 to 10. I will be totally straight with you - that process took me less than 1/2 hour at most - probably more like 20 minutes.

Common issues I saw:

- Nothing but Education.....

MOST people who applied for this role had very deep educational background - but most showed no personal interest in this type of work. Nothing in their hobbies and interests. No work for charities or groups doing ""stuff"" with data. Not even a ""I play about with a Arduino"" - judging by their CV's these people have done their degree/masters/PhD with no level of personal interest in their subject. Some recruiters won't mind this - personally it's a big issue for me - this is an R&amp;D role and so it needs enthusiasts. 



**""Extensive knowledge of Big Data..... with Excel""**
My team probably have 20+ platforms and systems available to them and I, generally, don't care what they work in ( Unusual by the way - most places either prefer SAS or prefer R as a default with other platforms as secondary choices). I don't think that a single one of them has gone more than 48 hours without using Excel. I am very Pro- Excel.

I do however expect MORE than just excel. I also expect more than Excel and VBA. VBA is, frankly, frigging AMAZING at what it does - I have made my previous employers a lot of money using VBA. But... if I want you to deal with 10,000,000 records - which I will - then you need more than this.


**Matlab....**
I had a whole bunch of MatLab only experts as well. Thats... OK... but if you want me to have to spend $100k/year to give you your tool of choice - you either need to dazzle me on why your amazing, or have a 2nd and third language in your arsenal as well and be damn sure to put a specific comment in your CV along the lines of ""I know Matlab is a bit niche.... I am a legend in Python/R/SAS/PERL as well""



**""I know SQL""**
What does this actually mean? Have you noodled with a bit of PostgreSQL? Are you a leading expert in PL-SQL and the bees knees at working with clobs and blobs? Are you an intermediate user of T-SQL, but only if you have all the MS widgetry available and turned up to 11? Do you use TOAD for looking at pictures of databases or tuning them?

For this specific role of mine, it's wasn't hugely important - but SOME knowledge of SQL is - for ANY role in this industry ( cos of GROUP BY and Hive if nothing else)  and if you have enough knowledge to add value, my expectation is that you know that ""I Know SQL"" is like saying ""I can do maths"" - its so expansive a statement it makes you look bad by putting it.

**The generic CV**
It sucks writing CV's - I personally hate doing it - so I can understand why other people do as well. But - you need to suck it up.

At least 1/2 the CV's I got were totally generic - it was entirely obvious that the same CV was being used to apply for a data science job in the financial services and an internship in a laboratory. You only get 2-3 pages to show yourself off in a CV, and so all any recruiter gets is a fraction of you if you use a generic CV.

You don't need to create a custom one for every single position, but you really should have a few ""flavours"" of CV's on hand - perhaps one for university positions, one for your PhD speciality in private industry, one for a data science specialty in private industry.  They are a pain in the arse to write, but you only have to do it once and it makes a huge amount of difference.

Also - don't assume I am a specialist in your specialist area - unless the rest of your CV is earth shattering, I am not going to go looking at Wikipedia - because I have 46 other CV's in front of me, a whole bunch of work, a whole load of meetings and, frankly, probably 10 or more of the 47 CV's I have will turn out to be as good as you.

This sounds brutal - and it actually may be is. But it's also realistic. Most people who applied are educationally similar - and so that means that the education is nothing special. You need to show me either ""valuable"", ""Different"" or ""Interesting"" to get a phone interview.


The way to think about it is that you have spent 17 years and god knows how much money to get your education. It doesn't take more than an extra 2-3 hours and no extra money in front of the laptop to make you shine - so it's probably a good investment. 

Anyway -

From the 47 CV's I got, I whittled it down to 8 good solid grads and post-docs 0- people I was interested in with good CV's, one horrible CV with little glimpses of genius in it that felt worth a 1/2 hour phone call and one frankly weird CV from a 20 year old kid which broke *every single rule* above, with not even a higher education background - but brings me onto the last rule.

**Sometimes it's about who you know**
This kid is, frankly, a ruffian. If I met him on a dark night I would cross the street to keep away from him. He has essentially no education and does have a criminal background. 

However - he's also known by someone that I respect a lot and who knew I was looking for heads. He would NEVER, EVER have made it onto my radar through usual channels - but he had impressed people who had impressed me - so he skipped the queue.

Again - perhaps unfair - but I don't know anything about the 46 other people, and a guy i think of as a genuis says that this kid is top talent - so he automatically wins.

Lesson here - reap your rolodex. Professors, people in industry, people you met at events. Collect phone numbers, make an impression and be open enough to ask them for help.

I'm apprehensive, though. I'm not sure this is worth the time or, more importantly, $16K. I also think I would be taking myself off the job market for the rest of the calendar year (they have a program beginning this month) and I haven't abandoned all hope of finding something before January.

I'm also a little bit concerned because, while I'm sure their (boastful) numbers are genuine (93% placement rate with a sizable median salary), they haven't yet graduated even one class in data science in Seattle yet. (They have programs in Denver and SF, I think). I've also spoken to two people in charge of hiring data scientists, and neither of them had heard of Galvanize.

In short, I'm wondering if it's worth it or if I should just continue my independent study and chip away at the job market. Does anyone know anything about Galvanize that might help my decision?

* Using skills-set (w.r.t. handling data) across teams more effectively 
* Exploratory data analysis to find predictors for customer satisfaction in product usage data 
* Exploration of how data could be used to help existing customers (e.g. dashboard with key metrics that lead to better outcomes)

I tried to answer as many of the comments as I could, and judging by my inbox, there were some people who were happy about what I put and others who weren't.

Such is life. For those that wanted the next section - here it is. 

Background:

I run a data science group in the UK working in the financial services world. As I have said a lot - all the advice that follows fits with private sector and may well not suit for academia/research posts.  I have hired a lot of data scientists over the years and also know a lot of other managers who hire them. This is aimed to be a blend of whats common across all of us.

***The ""I am in the UK"" section is especially important - some parts of an interview are cultural - and may well not apply in other countries. I *think* they do, but can't promise it ***

In my last post I whittled down 47 CV's to 10. 8 of them were good solid people, 1 was a terrible CV but with a few interesting elements and 1 was awful in every respect, but backed by a big Name in my industry who I respect.

I wrote a lot about these specific 10 interviews in a draft post, but I was a bit worried that if they read them they may have worked out who was who - so I deleted that draft and am re-doing this at a much more generic level as a general set of advice for people going through the process.

Like my previous posts - this is focused on those moving into this world, rather than hardened veterans who will already know all this. 

**Phone Interviews**
Phone interviews almost always happen first. Their purpose is not so much about whittling down X candidates to a pool of Y, but more about ""Do we want to be in a room with you for 2 hours"".


The key to the phone interview is:

* Show you know your subject
* Show some level of interest and enthusiasm
* Show your a regular person and not a crazy

Basically, phone interviews are more about getting rid of chaff than they are about finding the best of the best.

As the recruiter, I'm definitely going to come to some sort of initial opinion of you, but it's one that is subject to change if we meet.

Tips:
*Know your stuff* - pretty much all I have to talk to you about is your CV. Know it - dates, topics, subjects. If you have a complex MSc or PhD - be ready to explain it in an interesting way.

*Don't be scared* - A whole lot of people find interviews scary and phone interviews especially scary. The absolutely worst thing that can happen is that you don't get taken any further - and thats not a massive problem, so either relax, or fake being relaxed until you actually are relaxed. What ever happens, it'll be over in half an hour - anyone can get through 1/2 hour of anything.

*Answer the phone* - I reckon somewhere between 5% and 7% of interviews that are set don't pick up the phone. If you can't make the call, either call the agent or the recruiter in advance and reschedule.


***Face to face Interviews - First Impressions***

I know it sucks, but first impressions count. When first meet a candidate, within a few seconds, I have thought about three things:

* Would I put this person in front of my board
* Would I put this person in front of a client
* Would I speak to this person in a bar.

I would say that maybe 30% of all the people I do face to face interviews with I had eliminated within the first 2 minutes - and I honestly believe that I am much more relaxed than some interviewers I know in that metric. 

Lets cover some basics. These may not apply in the US, but definitely apply in the UK. I doubt they will hurt in other countries.

First impressions are weird - a lot of it doesn't actually matter in reality - but there is a basic code of conduct - I'm really checking to see if you know the rules and can stick to them. The vast majority of my team go for months on end without dressing smart, but a sad fact of life is that the bosses of companies are generally older men in their 50's and 60's, and THEY expect proper dress. If the staff can't dress, they can't go asking the old guys for money.

(I should note that roles like Data Scientists get a bit of natural leniency - I have an alarming number of men with pony tails and women with multi-coloured hair and lip piercings in my team in my team for example - you get a bit of slack if your in the ""genius"" category, but not a lot. We don't get a team photo put in the corporate brouches very often either, but that's actually a bonus)

**Men**

* Wear a suit. Navy blue, Dark grey or black with narrow pin stripes. Got a suit which is different to this - do not wear it.

* second hand suits are fine. Cheap suits are fine.  No one cares about names or brands in interviews. If it doesn't fit though, then you lose a point or two. If you have an expensive suit which doesn't fit then you lose more points for not knowing about suits. Learn the ""leaning against the wall test""
* Wear a belt. Belt needs to match shoes. 
* Shoes should be suitable for the suit. Consult Reddit Mens Fashion Advice for Info.
* Wear a shirt. light blue, dark blue, pastel pink or  plain white.  Nothing else!
* Wear a tie. Ensure tie matches shirt and suit. Don't wear school or military colors unless your entitled to. If you don't know what these are, play safe and wear a solid colour.
* Watches - optional. 
* Hair and beard: Haircut. Brush hair. Either clean shaven or trimmed beard. 

**Women**
* Wear a watch. I don't know why it's a thing, but a lot of interviewers will reject a woman for a professional role who doesn't wear a watch. It's like the male equivalent of a suit it would seem.  Don't ask me why it's a thing, but it's a thing.

Apart from that - you guys seem to have less ""rules"". Dress smart, brush hair etc. Do not put hair in mouth during interview. Or do the ""twirl your hair with your fingers"" thing. Thats not meant to sound condescending - it happens with a lot of people.

Did I mention wear a watch? Wear a watch.

**Types of Questions**

You will probably get a mixture of some or all of these - depends on the company thats interviewing you. 

**Competency based questions**
These all start ""Tell me about a time when....."" i.e. ""tell me about a time when you made a big mistake"" or "".... shouldered a lot of additional responsibility"". 

These are stories. Work out what sounds good - then give it a beginning (set context), a middle ( Actions you took ) and end (What you learned, why your special). 

**Technical questions/Coding tests**

Generally you will be given a problem, some data and a laptop and given 20 - 30 minutes to solve it. If you're going for a job that uses SAS a lot there are a lot of standardised SAS coding tests around which generate a score. For other languages like R or Python, expect someone to eyeball the code and ask you questions about the results. Also expect ""How would you extend this to do...X""

*Technical questions*: 

""How would you deal with a problem like...."" or ""Tell me about....."". Often have a skew in them ""How would you do X without using Algorithm Y"" for example - this is testing to see how you adapt.

These are the places to show ""real life"" awareness. So, pro-actively raise real life issues outside the specific question. I.e. ""Well.. before I start with X, I would expect the data to have some error in it, so I would do A and B to quickly check it. Assuming it is within tolerable levels I would.....""

Or

""I would do X. I know that can be quite computationally intensive, which can add cost and time, but the reason I think it's the best route is D and E. Perhaps we could do F and G to offset some of the time or cost....""

Showing you are attached to the real world is a huge separator between people who are close to each other in terms of knowledge in this world.

**PhD's - be ready for tougher treatment**

Some - not all - interviewers will ask a question like ""So, you spent 3 years doing a PhD in X .... why does that make you a better person?"" or even more frank - like ""....You did a PhD in X - that feels like a bit of a waste of time to me - justify why you did it""

Be frank, open and upfront. Don't feel cowed or belittled. It's just a test. But don't be cocky either. Remember - some people get annoyed by PhD's.

**Weird questions.**
The google type questions don't seem to happen much any more - although some banks use them. Get one of the ""google interview questions"" books - it's where the interviewer will have got their questions from.

*Fermi estimates* are pretty common and becoming ever more popular - I like to ask them as well. Getting the Ultimate Answer doesn't matter as much ( although it still matters ) as much as being able to see that you can handle questions out of your comfort zone and think in roughly the right way. 

Generally, if you can do good Fermi estimates, your safe to put in front of a Sales or Finance team - which is why they're getting common.

What If on xkcd.com is the absolute best place to learn Fermi Estimates. Start here:  https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/


**Personal questions** 

""Whats the biggest problem you've ever caused"". ""Where do you want to be in 5 years time""

* Answer in a ... neutral... manner. Not shy but not egotistically
* Answer in a practical manner - if your interviewing for a bank, you are not going to be running a whole department in 5 years time - so say your looking to be a Team leader instead as an  example. If your joining a start-up, then ""running a Data Science team of 50 adding X% to the bottom line"" is a more realistic answer.

**Do you have any questions?**
This is an important bit of the interview.... There is a right and wrong answer to this section:

Yes!!! Yes you do!!! I know you do because you will have very carefully worked on them before your interview. Note the plural.... not only do you have a question ... you have either 2 or 3 questions.

One of your questions is industry related, data related AND timely. For example - ""How do you see the EU Data Protection Act changing the way this team works? What challenges are you expecting"" or ""I can see how you could get a lot of value from doing sentiment analysis with Twitter data - do you think yesterdays challenge to Safe Harbour will cause problems""


Question 2 is you asking for elaboration on something interesting that the interviewer said and then saying something intelligent. I.e  

 "" You were talking about how BMW drivers have a lot more accidents than Mini Drivers - have you been able to look at any other variables - such as whether car colour or the drivers hobbies also have a strong corrolation and if they enhance the first model? (Both of them do by the way....)  Because I guess you could do some interesting work fairly quickly with X and Y to look a bit further....""
Be subtle here - there is a fine line between coming over intelligent and a dick. If in doubt - scale back a little

Question 3 is optional, and is also a subtle one. If you have expressed a deep passion for some specific element of the data science world, then raise it as a ""Would there be an oppurtunity to do X in this position"" sort of way.

Be careful here - you can look bad. For example - some industries flat out do not allow certain methods of machine learning as they go against certain regulations. If you shoot and miss you look bad.

**General advice**
*Stop. Think. Breathe... then answer.* 
If you get asked a hard question, take 30 seconds to think it through before you answer - thats totally OK.

If you get a tough question with multiple possible answers - Stop. Think. Breathe. List out the options and pick your preference. Say why it's your preference. A lot of questions are specifically selected to be hard to answer.

*""I don't know"" is bad. ""I don't know but...."" is OK. *
Unless you have put something specific on your CV and your being questioned about the topic, then in many cases it's OK, especially for junior roles, to not know the answer.

The critical thing is to not close down the answer - there is no where to go with ""I don't know"". Always change it to ""I Don't know but....""

""I don't know, but I would do the following to find out...."" or ""I don't know, but I have previously done X and Y which are similar and so I would expect A and B to be possible""

*Show your working.*
Interviews are a lot like maths tests - you get some points for giving the right answer and some points for showing your working out. If your thinking through a question, verbalise what your thinking. 

Lastly - sometimes it just doesn't go right and you're pretty sure you think your totally fucking up the interview. It happens to everyone occasionally - everyone.

If you think you have fucked it up but are SURE you could do better, there is literally nothing to loose by asking to start again. Literally - ""You know what - I'm making a total mess of this interview, and I know I can do a lot better. How would you feel about starting from the beginning again""

This CAN work - everyone knows someone who has done it. If you do this and then ace the interview you get extra brownie points for being concious of an issue and fixing it.

But - if you do this and you make a mess a second time, then it's going to *really* annoy the interviewer. So... ONLY do it if you really really genuinely believe you can be radically different.


The reality is that everyone is going to go for a lot of interviews in their lives, and they will either go well or go badly. Some will go badly no matter how hard you try. If you accept that and don't get wounded by it, it makes the next interview much easier.

Main objective is to try to use weather data to predict crop production.

So I've got a shitload of daily weather data with readings for temperature, precipitation, etc. These are a series of csv files for each year. All in all, about 12GB worth.

All I have is my lone PC to work with (no budget for AWS or anything like that as I'm broke), which has 8GB RAM and an AMD Phenom II CPU (i.e. not a laptop, but not super powerful either).

First step...

So I have all my data, with a lot of stuff I don't need (reading types, plus other countries). First step is to clear out all the crap and just get what I need.

Second, I plan to use a clustering algorithm to group locations which are similar together (e.g. there are hundreds of stations in a single city, which I'm vaguely interested in, but don't want to have to use each individual station as a variable in my analysis, so figure I can possibly lump them into smaller clusters of stations).

Initially I tried to use Python(Pycharm) to clear out the rubbish from each line (basic loop through each row and check if it was what I was looking for, write to a file if it was), but it was taking forever. I then tried to just load each csv file into R, and join them together as a single data frame. R had a fit because the frame ended up too big (kinda expected this, but figured I'd see what happened). So now I'm looking at setting up a PostgreSQL database and sticking it in there via a Python script, then using queries in SQL to calculate out the average monthly values I need (instead of the daily values), then output that view as a csv file and hope it's small enough for R to handle.

Then, using R I can do the cluster analysis and bring it down to a more manageable size for the various machine learning/regression techniques I want to try.

Does that sound sensible or am I going about this all wrong? Are there maybe some packages/tools which might be better suited for this?",4,4,False,self,,,,,

I have a full job description available, but since you all already know what a Data Scientist is, I'll hold off on that for now and just give specifics on what the candidates I'm searching for would look like. However, in this position you will be responsible for the development of data mining algorithms for structured and unstructured data. You will perform prototype implementation of algorithms and work with software developers to scale algorithms to cloud scales. This work will be done in support of DARPA projects with a client of mine. 

This is not a Data Solution Architect role, nor is it infrastructure related. It's more of an ""artsy"" Data Scientist role.

* PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical discipline is required.
* This position will require Top Secret/SCI clearance. You must be eligible to obtain this. Bonus points if you already have it.  
* R and Python (mathplotlib, NumPy, and pandas) are also must haves.
* Presenting well, being client-facing will be important in this role as well.
* Having been previously published is also a great thing to have!
* Relocation is possible, but will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

They are seeking individual contributors that excel at what they're doing, and would be interested in helping to build a team.

The office is Metro accessible.

If you're interested -- shoot over a message, and I'll give you my email address and contact information so you can send over your resume. 

If you have questions -- feel free to send me a message, post here, whatever works for you! I'm happy to help.

**Personal Background**(feel free to skip)

I work as a data analyst for a large health care company.  Most of my work is pulling data (from fairly complicated relational databases but mostly structured stuff) and providing basic summary statistics; not really in depth analysis.

I'd really like to do more advance analytics (I know this is vague) and my boss is totally in support of this, however there isn't really anyone in our section of the company doing this type of work so I'm kind of on my own.

**Project**

One of the specialties I do a lot of work on is urgent care.  Our urgent care centers are essentially somewhere between a typical urgent care clinic and an emergency department.  Many are open 24/7 and have access to onsite ancillary services (lab, radiology).  

One of the issues we face is long wait times.  While they're typically shorter than those at the ED, it's still creates a negative experience for patients.  

I've kind of floated around the idea of predicting wait times when someone arrives. To me this would be a great feature for patients when they arrive, however I don't think anyone in charge is particularly interested in it. They'd rather the wait times just be shorter so it isn't a concern which is perfectly understandable.

So then I thought by using the proper model it could be useful for quantifying factors contributing to this issue.  For example what role does the number of physicians / nurses play, ancillary turn around times, the conditions people are coming in with, etc.

**Data / Tools**
I have access to tons of data, electronic health records(pharmacy, labs, etc.), claims, membership information, staffing data, ERSI demographic information, and a lot of other things.

In terms of tools at my disposal, we use SAS at my company, which I don't think is incredibly popular here.  I have access to a very powerful server that also support SAS Enterprise Miner which is SAS's point and click analytics suite.  I am very familiar and capable with Base SAS, however not as experienced with the more advanced statistical procedures.

**Questions**

* Any general comments on the project above?
* Am I on the right track with this?  Is there a particular model you'd suggest researching to approach this problem?
* Am I over complicating this and there is a different way you can think I should be approaching it?
* Any resources or tips for working with health data like this or in general, especially diagnosis information?
* Any other comments?",12,5,False,self,,,,,

I really enjoy the entire class of subjects, statistics, machine learning, ai etc... I find myself wanting to learn more.

I work as a software developer (full stack .NET) and have about 4 years of experience. I have some basic SQL knowledge, I understand JOINS, GROUP BY, ORDER BY etc... I mostly do web development building dashboards, data visualization, and building the backend to supply the data (note: I do not do any data analysis of the data). I'm good at what I do, I've been promoted every year and now I am in change of multiple projects.

I use R at school and I have some beginner-intermediate Excel experience (I don't really program macros, but I don't think it'd be hard to learn). I'm a beginner at Python and I have some MATLAB experience as well.


I am just wondering how I would go about moving over to a data engineer/scientist position given my experience. Almost all of the DS jobs I see are 3-6+ years experience or PhD degree. The concept of a ""Junior DS"" just doesn't exist on LinkedIn (Chicago) as far as I've seen. 

EDIT: A lot of positions I see mention Hadoop, Hive, Spark, which I'm aware of but I have no experience in, am I using the wrong tools?

I wrote a program to classify them but it's not 100% perfect.  We ran the program and on a random sample of 1000 docs, we manually checked the outcomes.  Out of those 1000, 972 were correct and 28 were incorrect.

I'm not a Data Scientist by any stretch, I'm currently working toward a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science through an online University while working full time. I currently work as an Automation Technologist at a Tier-1 Automotive plant. So basically, I do the programming for the Robots, PLCs and computers on our paint line.
I've been recording the fluid used per robot per cart for this whole year and storing it all in a mySQL database. I have a small script in Python that queries the database to determine the total number of carts processed during the production day as well as the various styles and parse that to determine which parts only got the base coat and which got full colour coats. The details of that don't matter too much, but basically, I record every cart that the robots paint and determine our line efficiency based on that for management.
On average, we paint around 2000 carts per day. So that's 2000 carts * 8 robots ~= 16,000 data points per day. Over the course of the year, I have ~3.8 million records of how much fluid was used by the robots. We are set to get another 16 robots that I will set up to record the same information, so the number of records I have will explode over the next year or so. As I result, I want to start working on something with all this data, but I don't know what.
I have simple ideas like determining transfer efficiency on the various parts so we can start improving that (a couple mL per cart in paint savings is easily 100's of 1000's of dollars a year), but that's just summing some data and doing volume calculations. Not exactly advanced stuff.
Does anyone have any other ideas on what I could do with this data? Alternatively, if there is anyone familiar with industrial manufacturing, can you think of other information I should start recording that I will be able to use?
My company currently doesn't do any sort of data analysis and even my simple line efficiency calculation has forced them to rethink some assumptions that have previously been making, so I'd love to be able to do more and am totally willing to learn new things to be able to do that.

Here's the situation:

I completed an internship over the summer for a startup and they gave me an offer to return after I graduate (yay!).  I expressed my wishes to join the data science team when I return (the internship was really just data analytics/analysis, but my major has really over prepared me for a role like that.  I'm also currently doing research at my uni, etc.), but they told me that they want me to return on a team closer to marketing.  A few days ago they posted on their careers page a role identical to a role that I explained to them would be my ideal role.  They also denied my request for higher pay and title of data scientist.  They would like me to be an analyst, and work with the other analysts who have no formal math background. I literally know more about programming/math/data science than the entire team put together.  

Yesterday, someone else gave me an offer.  Less pay, worse benefits, no equity, but in a data science role.

I've already accepted the first offer.  

Here are my concerns:  I'm worried that working as an ""analyst"" will hinder my chances of moving into DS successfully, especially because I'm an undergrad only.  If I come out of school as a data scientist, it looks better.  Also I believe that the first company may not have my best interests in mind, seeing as they are willing to disregard what I want and put me somewhere else.

I have a dataset of ~20,000 items with lat/long coordinates, these items have a price value which I aim to predict. Domain specific knowledge indicates that items that are close to each other are likely to have similar prices, however each item also has a bunch of scalar and quantitative pieces of information attached to it, which are relevant to the price. 

[http://imgur.com/DuhrOT6](http://imgur.com/DuhrOT6) is a link to a visualisation of part of the dataset, color coded by deciles of price. 

If I didn't have the vector (location) values, I could see that this would be a trivial task: build a statistical model (probably starting with a linear model and ramping up the complexity) and predict the price. 

But what's the best way to incorporate the vector (location) values? Obviously one can think of ad-hoc solutions like k-nearest neighbour, average the price of similar items that are close, but that is almost certainly not making full use of the data, because information about items in similar ""areas"" or ""neighbourhoods"" that are a long way away is being thrown away.

I *could* add item and/or user attributes to the data set, but this would dramatically increase complexity.

As useful as I think it is for me to learn how to manipulate vast amounts of data (I work at a hospital so there's tons of data, a lot of which is 'dirty'), I know that eventually I'm not really going to find reporting that rewarding and I will want to be able to provide analysis/insights. Currently, I'm trying to learn as much as I can on my own via MOOCs/books/online resources but I'm worried that I'm missing out on a lot of stuff by not having a legitimate mentor/team to assist me.

So here's where things get a little confusing for me. From my understanding, I can get into analytics by a) doing it at a job or b) going to school (or both?). Option a is a little bit hazier since the organization I'm in doesn't really have a need yet for machine learning/data science type analytics--while there's a lot of patient data, it's not as clear cut to how we can even turn this data into anything meaningful because of how complex the data is. So I could perhaps wait it out here, see if we end up moving in the direction of advanced analytics, or I could try to jump into a different industry that has a bigger data science need. 

The other option I was thinking about was going back to school, getting a PhD in statistics/biostatistics. I already have a MS in biomedical sciences so I'm open to the idea of getting a PhD. This seems like the better choice, so I have a proper base to get into data science with.

If anyone can chime in on their experience, that would be very helpful. Thanks!",5,2,False,self,,,,,

As the story goes, I was recently hired on as a BA for a growing startup to replace their BA that is moving out of state. That BA relied heavily on Excel to perform the multitude of report generation that is required of the BA position. At the time of interviewing and getting the job, the company was just at the verge of exceeding the limits of Excel and they were hoping to find someone with a bit of SQL chops to transition away from Excel over a span of 3 months. Perfect time for me to come in with my little bit of SQL experience to try to learn as much and as fast as I could to move all reporting to be queried from a reporting DB. Well, business is booming and it turns out that it is very possible by we might have to moved completely to SQL based reporting model by the middle to end of next month. We are reaching anywhere from 100k-200k daily transactions and have a healthy lump of customer data that is updated daily - not to mention the piles of partner data. Queue feelings I haven't had since pulling all-nighters studying for college mid-terms - I need to know this stuff now.

Thus far, I have a cloud DB(AWS RDS) running postgres with a handful of tables and have started building a collection of views so I can at least build the reports out into a spreadsheet by running a query for each metric I need in each report. I know that is a bit cumbersome, but that is why I am here! I want to learn how to make report generation supremely easy and as automated as possible.

My company is based in RoR and PSQL, the cloud DB I mentioned earlier is my own DB to use for reporting, hence the DBA aspect. So, I am learning how to manage this DB and best schema practices. They want me to import all the data from the app into my reporting DB(so far I am accomplishing this by pulling CSV reports form the production DB and then 'COPY' them into my reporting DB). Then from there, automate all the reports that we have(daily, weekly, monthly, sales commissions, support commissions, partner data, etc). Also, what is the best way to grab the data from the production app to seamlessly slide it into my reporting DB? The CSV's I am grabbing are automatically generated daily and are accessible through an admin panel in our app as a downloadable CSV.

What would be the best things to look into or neat tricks/books/webinars/youtubes/blogs/etc that can help me learn how to do this more effectively. Any helpful pointers would be greatly appreciated, I feel like I do not know what questions to ask other than - How do you do it at your company?

I am having a blast from learning so much so fast and having such a great opportunity to become a data geek and to return the favor of teaching newcomers in the community.

I hold a undergraduate degree in Geology. 

I've been looking at Masters in the UK for GIS/Remote sensing, and I would like to use the Masters as a ""leap"" to something more data-heavy. Preferably, a job with lots of analysis, data management, structuring etc. Somewhat like a Data scientist. The 'end-goal' for the data doesn't really interest me, but rather how the data is analysed and manipulated.

The programming shouldn't be a problem. I know Python fairly well, and I'd be able to learn R or use NumPY. 

My question is:

Has anyone done a Masters in the UK for GIS/Remote sensing and been able to lever this into showing people you know how to manipulate data.

If so, where did you go? and/or your general progression to the above position.

If not possible through the means of a GIS/remote sensing Masters, does anyone have any ideas on how it would be possible?

I am a Computer Science and Engineering major who has recently taken an interest in data science/analysis. Unfortunately for me, the remainder of my classes at my university going to be focused on classes that are completely unrelated to this field (for the most part) and I would like to bolster my own knowledge with some self learning.

So, with my background out of the way, I've been looking into [this course](https://www.udemy.com/learning-python-for-data-analysis-and-visualization/?couponCode=DEAL19&amp;siteID=Kzz30XxWgII-aBXXsJOHKS8ZfqdP7061dA&amp;LSNPUBID=Kzz30XxWgII) and was wondering if anyone has had any experience within this specific course. I have a Udemy coupon that will bring the price down to $10, so price isn't really an issue. 

I'm a little concerned as there are no submissions of assignments that will lead to feedback, but if the content is worthwhile I figure it might be worth it. 

Any/all opinions? And thanks in advance!

I have about 2,000 stemmed texts from a particular subreddit and I want to class them into two separate classes.  If I run the initial Multinomial Bayes bag-of-words model I get ~72% accuracy:

    Score: 0.716647706839
    Confusion matrix:
    [[801 315]
    [318 888]]

But if I run the program using scikit's in-house TFIDF transformer, I get an accuracy rate that's lower:

    Total documents classified: 2322
    Score: 0.664544572595
    Confusion matrix:
    [[ 649  467]
    [ 189 1017]]

But everything I've read states that TFIDF should have higher accuracy.  If I run the models using SVM, I get the expected result:
     Bag-of-words:
     Score: 0.655091615516
     Confusion matrix:
     [[757 359]
     [435 771]]

     TFIDF
     Total documents classified: 2322
     Score: 0.680026329062
     Confusion matrix:
     [[746 370]
     [333 873]]

So in SVM I get lower general accuracy, but the TFIDF results are higher than BOW which is expected.  Does anyone know what might be going on in my scikit model?  My advisor doesn't have any experience with scikit and prefers to code everything by hand, which I'd like to avoid doing.

I know one common technique for forecasting time series data is using an ARIMA model, however this type of model does not seem to allow for the potential impact of external variables, such as the number of emails we send in a month or the amount we spend on paid web advertising.

In this case, since we can forecast our advertising dollars and email sends with at least some accuracy, would it be better to try and forecast the direct visitors using a multivariate regression model?

I created three models for my training data, random forest model, SVM model and a KNN model. However when I use linear method to stack these ensemble methods together the error I get is lower than the RF model only about 40% of the time.

The linear method that I employ for stacking is a plain one: determining coefficients of each model and minimizing their least squares.

Am I missing something? This results in a ""best case"" scenario less than half the time, so I would be better off just using the randomforest model.

Secondly, What exactly are meta features as described in the netflix prize winners paper? How do I extract them for any data and successfully use them to build a lower error ensemble that individual models themselves?",1,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm a recent college graduate looking to make data science my career. My Bachelor's is in Actuarial Science, and I'm considering going for a Master's in Data Science. I've taken a decent number of math/statistics courses in undergrad, and I've got some programming experience: R, SQL, Python, Java, M. Hell, I've even worked on a couple big data analysis projects (one was the March Madness competition on Kaggle this year). 

My current employment is for a software company in a tech support-ish role, and it's not really what I want to be doing. As you know, most jobs with big data require some amount of experience in the field or a Master's degree. Since I obviously don't have these, can anyone recommend what kinds of positions I should be looking for with my current qualifications? I've tried looking online for titles like ""Data Analyst"", ""Financial Analyst"", etc. I'm just not sure where else to explore. 

If you're willing to share how you got into the field, please feel free to tell your story. Any pointers/tips/advice would be incredibly appreciated. ",10,2,False,self,,,,,

A few questions for the community:

1. How do you current collect data? Do you download from individual sites or mine it yourself?  Or is there a similar service available?

2. Do you think there is a need for a single API to access large amounts of data, or are data analysis needs usually so specific that people would rarely find use in having data like Education, Weather, Stocks and Sports accessible under a single API key?

3. Would you pay for a service like this for $20-30/month?
