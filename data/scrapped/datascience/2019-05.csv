1. ARMAX/ARIMAX, which incorporates covariates into the model as additional terms
2. Regression with ARIMA errors, which is regression first, and ARIMA in the regression model's error term

One part under the 'Regression with ARMA errors' section stuck with me but I can't seem to figure it out:

"" **There is not much to choose between the models in terms of forecasting ability**, but the additional ease of interpretation in the second one makes it attractive. ""

Was wondering if the reddit DS community had any inspiration. 

I started off with a k means clustering using 3 features I thought were a good foundation of the population...Good foundation meaning quantitative, fairly normally distributed, and features all users must have. 4 clusters were found to be the optimal k. After, I started diving into the stats of the groups to see if there were any features only found in single group.  I honestly wasn't even sure if this was a helpful step in developing personas, but it did help me understand the groups better. So now I have 4 groups I understand fairly well, but 2 are too large to be considered finished and I have features that are highly correlated to the k means features, features I believe to be irrelevant, and categorical features that I think could help break out new personas from the larger 2.

The determining factors for the results of training a model or other activities include the following:

* Training datathe image database or whatever data source is used in training the model
* The scripts used in training the model
* The libraries used by the training scripts
* The scripts used in processing data
* The libraries or other tools used in processing data
* The operating system and CPU/GPU hardware
* Production system code
* Libraries used by production system code

Obviously the result of training a model depends on a variety of conditions. Since there are so many variables to this, it is hard to be precise, but the general problem is a lack of whats now called Configuration Management.

Tl;dr presenting in a conference soon. I'm not familiar with all the math around the algorithm in presenting. What if someone will ask me something I don't know? It's a 2-3 minutes q&amp;a.

Longer version:

For the past year I worked as an undergraduate research assistant (studies CS). I didn't really sink deep into the theory - I was too busy writing the algorithm, optimizing it, automating everything (analysis, benchmarks etc) and data processing. 

I was pretty good at it, did a good job and my professor really liked me, so as a bonus she signed me up for speaking in some conference in Europe (abstract got accepted etc).

So that's great for someone who's in their first CS degree, but fuck I'm scared. It's in less than 2 months, 20 minutes speaking and 2-3 q&amp;a. I'm terrified from the q&amp;a. I'm presenting next to brilliant people from prestigious schools (M.Sc and above obviously), and I don't even have (yet) a B.sc.

Obviously I know the algorithm well, but I'm not familiar with the small specs. Some stuff I just used as black boxes. What if someone will ask me a question I have no clue how to answer?

I know I have time to prepare, but I already know I won't be 100% or even 80%. I pushed myself too much to the limits this year with too much courses, a job and this cursed research (I'm studying or working all day so I don't really have much time).

The apps are either scraping website data or retrieving data from an API every x minutes/hours/days.

However, I'd rather not run these apps on my laptop since it's not always on and running 24/7.  
  
However, I'm looking to run these apps from a cloud service and store the data up there as well. An example would be running the apps from an EC2 instance on AWS and storing the data in S3.  
  
EC2 + S3 is currently what I'm leaning towards but I wanted to see if there was any better/cheaper setups for this. The apps collecting the data don't necessarily require a big server but that could be a potential concern depending on the data storage type. There may be cases where I need to check if data exists already so I may need to read it all into memory. There are work arounds for this though.  
  
Another option that seems viable is using AWS Lambda. I'm just not sure how efficient this is for scraping data. I haven't done too much research into it.

 Anyone interested in learning how to do multiple regression analysis in Python can check out some videos I posted on YouTube, I walk through building the model and evaluating it. I also provide the code for any of those who are interested in leveraging it themselves. The code primarily leverages two libraries, SkLearn for building the model and the StatsModel library for diagnosing the model.

 I've just graduated last year from a Bachelors in A.I, and am currently doing a Master's in the same field. Honestly the job sounds very interesting as it involves getting familiar with the type of data the company has, designing and building of the analytics system, deriving analytics and reporting on them, etc, with the potential of also using Big Data solutions such as Hadoop or Spark. It also comes with a significant pay increase compared to my current job (developer).

The thing is, and I did point this out to them, that I am in no way an expert on the field, and am still learning (I consider myself a quick learner). I have quite a good idea about what needs to be done and how, but the only thing that is worrying me is that for now at least I would be alone in my role, consulting with the other managers and taking technical decisions for the company. I'm concerned that it might be overwhelming for me, both the size of the work itself and the experience desired. Despite this I know that if I focus and do my job well, the experience would slowly build up and a job such as this would set my career straight.

What do you guys think? I have worked with ETL, data mining, analytics, big data etc before but nothing at this scale. Should I go for it? It's a huge opportunity for me, and I feel I'm at a dead end at my current work anyways.

80% of the effort in Data Science projects is due to Data Understanding, Transformation, and Cleaning.

And of course, it all starts with Data Exploration. If you don't understand the data set, you cannot work with it.

But understanding a data set is very tedious work.

You need to perform a lot of different analyses. Handle the messy data. And drill deeper, because there is always something odd in the data.

# Introducing edaviz:

[https://github.com/tkrabel/edaviz/](https://github.com/tkrabel/edaviz/)

edaviz is a Python library which helps you to quickly understand and visualize your data frames.

It is most helpful during data exploration after you received a new data set.

But you can also use it during data cleaning and data transformation, during feature engineering, or during model evaluation. Whenever you need to understand your data.

&amp;#x200B;

**The features:**

* quick exploration without coding but full flexibility of code
* high interactivity and data drill down
* find the best features for predicting your target
* explore predictive patterns between columns
* automatically chooses visualizations based on data types

Going forward, edaviz will also include semi-automated data cleaning and transformation in a similar easy fashion...

&amp;#x200B;

You can find a demo video in the github repository. If you like the project, show some love via starring the github repo.

I started with a company that was fairly small company a couple years ago, and long story short were blowing up and I moved up a lot in that time. I can comfortably call myself advanced in excel and probably intermediate in VBA. Admittedly Im in the habit of erring towards formula-based solutions than VBA ones  I used VBA mostly for automating tasks or idiot-proofing something Ill hand off to someone else, I end up with stupidly long complicated formulas instead. There was a lot of years of self-study that went into learning that though, Ive worn out a few Excel Bibles to get here. Currently I mostly consolidate information across the company. I do a lot of fairly simple business analytics now, usually just helping verify and visualizing information we need thats scattered in a hundred different places in the company. What do we spend on X, how much revenue is generated by Z, is it cheaper long term to do this or that things like that. Nothing earth shattering but it has been a really good thing for the company I work for so far. 

With the way things are going my employer and I are on the same page that its going to be beneficial for me to feel more confident in my data analytics skills. I want to be able to do more in depth business analytics and expand beyond using excel for everything. I know I need a knowledge of Python, SQL, tableau, and just statistics in general right now. 

All that said I think I want to do a bootcamp and I have no idea where to go for it. It seems like there are hundreds to choose from and many of them are meant to compliment masters degrees or PhDs. Prior posts here seem to be more geared towards how the certification looks on a resume which isnt really what Im looking for, the desire to complete a bootcamp is really because Im just trying to be the best business analyst I can possibly be in six months from now. Cost isnt an issue really, my employer will pay for it although Im not looking to waste their money on the most expensive thing out there either. I travel extensively so I would need something online, full time would be hard but I can make it work for a short period of time for a good program, thankfully my employer is really supportive.
 
Where the heck do you even start when looking for a boot camp? Should I take an SQL course first? Am I just barking up the wrong tree here entirely by thinking I should do a bootcamp? I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to help me, I just started looking into it and Im really intimidated and scared of falling for a scam.

However the issue is I have many students data with each interacting differently with different topics=&gt; so essentially a time-series per student per topic and each time-series needs to be forecasted a few steps. My students range in the order of 10s of thousands. And there are dozens of topics they access- essentially 100 x 1000 time series. To predict each, I dont, at run time have the ability to determine stationarity, seasonality, etc for a time-series--&gt; consider a student that answers questions regularly in a subtopic and shows consistent performance, versus someone who is erractic in their performance -&gt; getting easy/moderate questions wrong, but doing well on difficult questions, or someone who shows steady improvement over say the past 12 months.

Some student-topic combination has data of \~500 , while some of &lt;10. I'm ok with a min-data cutoff of 30 data points (each attempt by a student on question belonging to a sub-topic will generate a data-point).

The attempt time-stamp is also a undetermined variable-subsequent attempts can take days to occur or a few minutes. I'm currently using a time-based penalty on performance (rewarding regular attempts and penalising delayed attempt based on time of delay from last attempt to current attempt within the topic. This transformation I can undo from the forecast, or can use a multi-variate approach and use this as a supplementary time-series.

I'm ok with the univariate approach. ARIMA, VAR require stationarity modifications-which I cant/not sure if it can be done at run-time dynamically. LSTM and RNN may work but I'm not sure what kind of tuning is required. I'm exploring MDN (Mixture density network)-again not sure how to model or if its appropriate-its probabilistic modelling seems interesting.

# Introduction

The main aim of the project was to learn the basics of web scraping by creating simple yet effective scrapper able to gather interesting data I could use later for future projects.

For the website to scrap from I chose [https://bazar.lowcygier.pl/](https://bazar.lowcygier.pl/). Its an online marketplace which let users sell or exchange their gamesmostly cheap, indie ones. It has a simple webpage structure and contains a lot of (potentially interesting) data, which makes it a perfect target for a simple web scraping project. The site is in Polish, but as were gathering mostly numeric data it shouldnt be too hard to follow along if you wish to. I would translate all important info as we go.

#### Heres what Im trying todo:

* Scrap the entire marketplace to prepare a database containing basic information (name, lowest price, number of offers, game tags) of all games currently being sold on the siteupdated daily.
* Scrap most recently updated offers to search for interesting deals.
* Cross-reference the data from the point above with the database to check if those deals are truly interesting.
* Provide recommendations for the trader which games yield potential resell value at the moment.

Im  a junior in college, majoring in actuarial science. My university  offers courses that are aligned with the actuarial exams. Ive passed  exams FM, P, and IFM from the SOA. I chose to major in actuarial science  because I heard it involves math and computer science and pays well  too. I've always enjoyed math, and I've been programming for years.  However, Im realizing that actuarial science involves little math and  involves hardly any computer science. All of the actuarial science  courses are geared toward memorizing formulas and tricks for solving  specific types of questions on the actuarial exams. Personally, I'm not a  fan of this type of math. I prefer writing proofs and thinking about  more abstract concepts, so the actuarial science courses are extremely  boring for me. From what I've heard, the actuarial science career is  even more boring. I've also heard the profession is very saturated and  it is difficult to find a job, even with several exams passed.

As  a result, I'm thinking about going into data science instead, but I  have some questions. First, how does data science compare to actuarial  science in terms of salary and job stability? Second, should I switch my  major to something other than actuarial science, and if so, what?  Third, data science jobs usually require graduate degrees. I personally enjoy both math and computer science and could see myself doing either, but is there a  particular degree that is preferred (computer science, pure math, applied math, statistics, etc.)?

I am a 25-year-old junior data scientist with only about half a year of experience right now and I know with about a year at my current job I would like to leave and probably move to a new city. The role actually involves both advanced analytics and machine learning (I know a lot of people in DS jobs that don't actually do ML, which is fine, but I wanted to note that because it is relevant experience). Before this job, my only relevant work experience was as a masters teaching assistant for an advanced statistics course, a course assistant for an R data analytics course, and some quantitative research assistantships. 

My undergrad was in behavioural science but I took a lot of statistics classes, a statistical modelling honours thesis, programing, data structures and algorithms etc., and went on to do a modelling masters degree which had a big data focus. I am educated with university courses in statistical modelling, data mining, big data, data visualization, databases and so on. In terms of real skills, I have a strong to very strong grasp of R and Python (for both programming and data science purposes), decent SQL skills, and I have experience with AWS and Spark. Big data tools are only somewhat interesting to me - I would never want to be a big data engineer, I prefer analytics and DS. I also have been told I have very strong soft skills and do well not only on the technical side, but also communicating with clients and business people. 

Now that I have given an overview of myself, I am curious where I should consider moving as a young person in this area. I have limited experience but I believe I have a pretty solid foundation to build on. I would like to start a life somewhere so both salary range as well as cost of living is a big concern. I currently live in Canada and I am not very familiar with the job market and cost of living in the US. I am also unfamiliar with the job market in Europe and Australia. 

These are the benefits of where I live now and my current job:
- low cost of living/rent
- 10 min walk to work downtown
- ~70k working in the public sector, so a load of benefits and incredibly strong pension and bullet-proof job security on top of that (strongly unionized). 
- I know I will be promoted early next year. 
- There may be new mandates on how we are paid, and everyone in my area would see a salary increase by default in the coming years.
- lots of sideways movement, I can get new jobs in the public sector very easily if I want to. 
- probably the best work-life balance I could ask for and boss is very laid-back and allows me to have flexible work hours.   
- I am allowed to have a lot of time on the job to do personal training/my own work.

Downsides: 
- I don't think I want to live in my current city for very long but it is where almost all the jobs are in the public sector. 
- my boss is leaving and it is unknown how my new boss will be. 
- oftentimes, I feel it is too slow and I could be doing more with my time. 
- the environment is pretty dim and depressing sometimes. 
- I will probably be able to earn more in the private sector, but perhaps the benefits will not be as good (not sure).  
- I simply believe I would be happier somewhere else (which is the biggest factor for me).  

Weighing these pros and cons, some people tell me to stick it out for sometime as it is a pretty good deal right out of school, while others say to move to other places with more opportunities once I have proven experience. I do not need a lot to keep be happy, but I would like job security, that is probably the biggest supporting factor for keeping my current job.  

Does anyone have recommendations for me? Where are the opportunities for someone with my background? Where are the best places to look for work and build a life? Any personal experiences that are relevant?

I am at a crossoads because I want to become a good data scientist but I have had difficulty learning it all on my own through online courses. I am an accountant with a CPA and two years of pure mathematics (multi-variable calculus, real analysis, linear algebra) before business school under my belt, but I am seriously lacking the statistics and computer science needed for data science. 

I want to dedicate my time fully to gaining the skills. From reading this site, it seems people have mixed reviews about a professional masters (Analytics, Data Science) and 12-week bootcamps. There seems to be higher praise for more academic degrees (Masters of Statistics or Computer Science). As I come from a pure math backround, the statistics one is very appealing.

My questions are, regarding a Masters in Statistics:

1. Does having a more academic degree, coming with all of the pure research, tuition costs, and courses that you will likely never apply in a job make it worth it because you are seen to know the math behind data science more deeply?
2. Do you actually learn the math deeper behind data science, and therefore actually become a better data scientist? Or do you specialize too much in a field in the masters and therefore would have to learn everything on the job anyway?
3. Even if you do a masters in stats, would you still need to learn all of the computer science on the side? Or would they typically offer you the comp sci courses as well?
4. It seems like even after all of your actual studies, you still need personal projects. Therefore, in a masters of stats, would you have had enough personal projects through your courses to put on a resume or a github? Or would this have to be on the side as well?

If anyone has any experience doing a masters in stats as a transition into data science, I would love to hear your personal experience as well, you can write here or PM me!

There are valid arguments on both side of the aisle, but I wanted to highlight one point that seems to get lost often during these conversations:

&gt;**There is nothing** ***inherently*** **wrong with a Data Science-specific degree**

What do I mean by that?

I mean that anyone who is critical of a Data Science-specific degree is (in general) not critical of the theoretical concept of a degree that focuses specifically on preparing students to work in Data Science. In fact, I think a lot of us would have greatly enjoyed having such an option when we were in school - and the foresight to know that Data Science would become what it is today.

But no, we (again, in general, I can't speak for everyone) don't think there is anything wrong with Data Science-specific degrees as a concept. The concept is solid, and is no different than, for example, an Operations Research-specific degree (when OR used to, and sometimes still is under Industrial Engineering), or Architectural Engineering degrees (used to be part of Civil), or Biomedical Engineering (used to be part of computer science and/or electrical engineering), or Computer Engineering (used to be Electrical).

This is actually just the next natural step in moving from what was an obscure specialization to what is now a mainstream area of both work and research.

**Ok, then what is your problem with Data Science-specific degrees?**

I would say that there are a couple of very common, well-agreed upon issues that detractors have of Data Science-specific degrees:

**1) Not a research degree**

MS degrees in DS specifically are not generally research degrees, i.e., you are not expected to put together a research thesis in order to graduate. I don't think the research output itself is critical, but what is very important (and you only figured this out once you are out of research), is that having done research arms you with the confidence and the tools you need to pick up any new topic as you see fit. It may take you time - and often more time than it's worth spending to learn something completely unrelated to your strengths, but it puts you in a mental state where nothing is unlearnable anymore - just a factor of how much time you have to learn it and the payoff.

**2) Unknown level of rigor**

Both BS and MS degrees in data science have not been around long. As a result of that, there aren't a ton of graduates out in the world proving out their value, and sharing their experiences with the world. As a result of that, we (those who have been out of school for a while), have no idea what your school experience was like. While we were in school, we saw first hand what most other disciplines looked like live - what classes they took, who were the people in those majors, how smart they were, how much they struggled. I have a high opinion of Econ grad students (for example), because I took a grad class in Microeconomics and it kicked my ass. I sat in on a graduate CS class once and it was also a wake up moment.

**I have no experience with a Data Science class**. I don't know how hard it is. I don't know how hard the tests are. I don't know how many people fail them. I don't know how many people get As. I don't know how much you are expected to do in order to pass or ace the class. Because of that, I cannot develop a positive expectation of what a graduate from one these programs has proven by graduating - and that is an issue for the person getting the degree, especially because....

**3) Hiring Manager bias**

Most hiring managers in Data Science today are either Gen Xers or Millenials. That means that most hiring managers were in school at a time where Data Science was not a degree option. A well established fact about hiring managers is that they tend to - whether consciously or sub-consciously - hire people who are ""like them"". It's a huge problem for a wide range of reasons, but also something that is very difficult to fight against from the outside. In fact, the only people that can really change this are hiring managers themselves - by forcing introspection and ensuring that they are not letting their personal biases run their hiring practices.

What does that mean for someone who has a Data Science degree? It means that, from an educational standpoint, you may be perceived as dis-similar as possible by potential hiring managers who are much more likely to have degrees in CS, Stats or Engineering (and probably in that order). Again, it is not an inherent problem with a DS degree - it is purely a problem with the potential perception of hiring managers, but it becomes a very real problem of the degree holder because they may (unfairly) be discriminated upon.

**4) Uncertain future**

Remember when HDDVD and Blu Ray were fighting it out for the future of high definition discs? Remember before that when regular DVDs popped up and some people thought they were a fad? Remember VHS vs. Betamax?

Anytime something new enters the market there is a non-negligible probability that it will fail.

One of the huge chunks of ""value"" of a degree is that you get to piggyback on the reputations of all previous holders of that degree. For a lot of us, that has had very, very real implications in our lives - hiring managers and peers will look at your education and quickly look through their past to see if they know people who came from your degree and school. I have had conversations at new jobs start with ""oh, my advisor must have been at Northwestern at the same time as yours!"", or ""my first boss also had a degree from X"", or ""my roommate in college was an X major"". 

Once again, we are talking about bias - and the fact that people try to find patterns and reference points and will tend to ""slot"" new things into categorizations that they already have.

Data science-specific degrees do not have that advantage... yet. The reality is that they will before long, but in the short term there is very little collateral benefit that you get from the perspective of capitalizing of the goodwill/brand that your predecessors have built for you.

More importantly, specific Data Science-specific degrees may go defunct. We don't know what the future of the field looks like, but there is certainly a world in which Data Science as a unified field starts fading in favor of a return to some of its core areas (statistics, machine learning, optimization, etc.), at which point a Data Science degree may no longer be a degree that attracts the same level of talent/money/etc. If that is the case, someone who gets a DS degree today could be looking in the future at a situation in which the degree they received no longer exists. Again, not inherently an issue, but it is a fringe benefit of traditional degrees that could be lost.

So what does this all mean?

If you buy into a DS-specific degree, it's because you buy into the overall package, you accept the risks, and you think this is a degree that as we continue to move into the future it will become a more and more established area of work, research, and study. As I said - there is nothing inherently wrong with the concept of a DS-specific degree, and if you buy into the program's execution, rigor, brand, and staying power, then there's no reason for you to worry.

However, understand that our concern - and our apprehension - about the suitability of these degrees is precisely a risk-averse position in regards with all 4 of those factors.",83,50,False,self,,,,,

Id greatly appreciate some feedback on whether it matters to do the prep work for graduate school via Coursera, Online, Recommended Textbooks OR if it would be important to take structured classes in a university setting since the coursework is fairly dense/difficult in some cases? 

I am currently a data scientist at a top 10 US bank and my analytics team manages all of the analyses for our payments portfolios (debit and credit). My background is in finance and economics. I lack the higher level math to understand some of the algorithms we are working on and want to understand things at a deeper level. 

Im getting to a point where Ive worked on a lot of very cool projects, learned SQL, SAS, etc. and am good from a programming and application perspective but would like to fill in my background formally with some of the higher level math and computer science classes.

Interested in pursuing a comp science masters at a top school and have the following types of classes on my list to take/learn before applying:

1- Engineering Calc (Calc I and II)
2-Linear Algebra
3- Probability and Statistics Class (will my business stats class count for this?)
4-Discrete Math
5-Object Oriented Programming
6-Data Structures
7-Algorithms or Automata Theory
8-Computer Organization and Assembly Language
9-Operating Systems.

I really want to be careful and methodical about this and how I approach things. Ultimately will probably end up getting a masters but would like to avoid paying for the prep classes ahead of that if possible... if any of these classes seem unnecessary would also like your thoughts - just want to set myself up well for the long-term both breadth and depth wise

I am looking to pursue a masters degree in the analytical field. I have a BA in Econ and am seeking to add greater analytical tools and programming languages to my skill set.

I was initally drawn and set on pursuing an MS in Business Analytics. However as I did more research, I realized that Applied Statistics would be an even better degree as it would add the math element on top of the programming aspects that can be self-taught. 

&amp;#x200B;

After researching online Applied Stats MS programs (looking at a good balance between low-cost and decent quality), I realized I lacked the calculus prereqs to qualify. I am eager to start my masters soon and am frankly not attracted to investing the time into taking these prereqs.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are....

1. What are the best alternatives to an MS in Applied Stats? 
2. Are there Business/Data Analytics MS programs with more stats/math-centric curriculums?
3. What should I look for in an Analytics curriculum? What classes should I hone in on?
4. Would taking the prereqs to pursue an MS in Applied Stats simply be worth it over an MS in Business/Data Analytics?

This is working pretty well, but the user is not seeing the request generated under the hood and sometimes it happens that important words are not recognized and thus creating an incomplete SQL request (e.g.: if the 'order by' part is missing in your SQL request, you still get a valid request but somehow incomplete and there is no direct way for the user to see it).

In order to give the user some feedback, I've trained a binary classifier to tell whether the request generated is valid (and complete). I then apply some thresholds to the proba of being valid to get different levels for the feedback.

To my surprise, among all the created features, the ""simpler"" ones are those weighting the most in the final decision.

Those features are for example the number of words in the query, the ratio of non stopwords that are not used in the entities found by the NER tasks, the presence of some keywords (e.g.: if there is a ""top/bottom"" word in the sentence but no presence of ""order by"" in the generated query), the presence of a verb in the sentence, etc...

Hence my question. I'm very curious about some simple features I haven't thought of that I could try.

Fun fact: I was surprised when I saw it doesn't matter whether a word is in uppercase or not. Then I remembered I was lowering the sentence during the preprocessing...",7,1,False,self,,,,,

TL:DR; **Loading .npy files is ~70x faster than .csv files. This actually adds up to a lot if you - like me - find yourself restarting your kernel often when you've changed some code in another package / directory and need to process / load your data again!**

Obviously there's some limitations like the use of header / column names, but this is entirely possible to save and load using a .npy file, it's just a little more cumbersome compared to .csv formats.

I am currently pursuing a masters degree in data science and have almost completed my second semester. I'm hoping to enter the industry soon and have a few questions I was hoping this community could answer. 

1. Are there any opportunities which are limited only for pursuing masters students. eg. I saw an internship offer for pursuing graduate students at Nike. I am looking for internships and/or competitions which specifically aimed at college students. I don't want to skip anything which could only be done while doing a masters. 

2. While applying for internships I understand it's an advantage to have a portfolio of your projects. What kind of projects are the companies looking for? Is stuff like stock market prediction or employee attribution prediction better than personal fun projects. Or is it better to have a mix of both?

3. What's the best way to showcase your portfolio to potential employers? Should I upload my R/ Jupyter code to github and publish the insights on medium/linkedin? Is there a better way of doing this? What if I wanted to create a website? I don't really have much web dev experience apart from basic html/css and i'm not sure I want to invest my time doing that as the masters is quite intensive. Does having your own site significantly increase your chance of getting hired?

4. When should I start applying If I want an internship starting January 2020 (that's when my coursework finishes).? 
5. Should I only limit to applying for internships given I have almost no prior work experience. I think a lot of the full time positions seem to require work experience. Would it be a waste of time to apply for these positions?

6. Are there any research oriented positions available in the industry?

I would be grateful if someone could share their insights regarding any of the above points. Thanks in advance.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

I am genuinely interested in the later position and would likely enjoy the work. I'll also improve my CV if I decide to seek similar technical roles after graduation. But some peers are of the opinion that Project/Product management is always a step up from a Data scientist/ ML engineer position. So I should jump ship as soon as I have the chance.

I would have loved to do both, but sadly the internship is full-time. From the more experienced people in this group, do you think having tangible credentials as in project/ product management matter in the long run? In my position, which option do you think is more likely to give me a an edge going forward?

Now I have a xlsx file with all then informations about the packages (timestamp/name et.) - but since i collect all the data i have multiple form the same device but i only want to have a single one as a sort of confirmation that the device was in my near for the first time at XXX. 

&amp;#x200B;

The endgoal is to have a graphic which shows how many devises passed my (Raspberry Pi with wifi card) device at a certain time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the link to a dropbox with the .xlsx file (I had to remove the MAC adresses beacuse of safty reasons, but imagine there are MAC adresses who sometimes show up duble or more)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working on an NLP project on a relatively large dataset (\~15GB of text and metadata).   

&amp;#x200B;

Generally, I have enough RAM to do everything that I want to do with my data. If I run operations individually, save the result, close R and then reopen it everything works fine. However when I try to run the whole script (even after deleting unused objects and functions as soon as possible), the sessions memory usage quickly starts exceeding the available memory and R crashes, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I understand this is that many of the prepacked functions I'm using (even from 'reputable' packages like dplyr or stringr) have memory leaks that quickly build up and the hidden memory usage doesn't get freed unless I go through the cumbersome procedure of closing and reopening the R session. Something I don't want to have to do all the time, I'd much rather do something productive while my script is running for a couple of days instead of having to always rewrite everything on my hard drive.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question: Is there any way to delete unused memory pointers without always having to restart R or, even worse, rewriting the functions myself (which I probably couldn't do better anyways)?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: memory leaks and not the data and operations itself are clogging up my RAM and I don't know what to do about it

Thought 1: Given I know the important features, would testing the categorical variables populations against each continuous variable be a valid way of grouping members? E.g. if a category is binary, looking if the population of 1 is statistically significant from population 2 for each continuous variable. (z test maybe)?

- Set up an ODBC connection to their computer

- Use the ODBC connection to connect to a server using R or Python

One of the challenges that I've faced in the past (at a past company) is ML model deployment. We did almost everything on-prem and didn't really have the DevOps infrastructure in place to support cloud technology. The DS team would create a chron-job to train and create a model every morning. We would also build a flask API that wraps our model predictor. The API knows to use the latest .pkl model file. 

The API would sit behind the DMZ. Our internal web services would call our API. We had CI/CD and everything. 

The problem is that we were doing everything ourselves (except for the actual deployment...DevOps did that) and that took up way too much time. 

Now at this new company, I'd like to avoid that same pitfall. We're very open to cloud technology here and primarily use AWS. I've been looking at AWS Sagemaker and GCP AI Platform as our end to end DS platform. What I want is for us to shorten the time from ""Proof-of-Concept"" to ""Production"". 

DEV/TEST Environment: I want us to build a model from our dev databases, evaluate for accuracy, and get that model into an API. 

PROD Environment: Once all the coding is done, I want to deploy this to prod. This means all connection strings would point to our production databases. Build the model and get it into an API.

Anybody have any experience with AWS Sagemaker or other cloud ML deployment platforms?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing a lot of soul-searching as an upcoming college sophmore and asking questions in subs like r/statistics and r/AskEconomics have been helpful in laying out the best possible career paths for possibly working in Data Science/Data Analytics/Statistics. I think I want to gain the **mathematical/statistical/analytic/programming skills** required to work in this diverse field (I hope that I'm in the ballpark in describing this, I'm still kinda naive to what exactly this field entails), and that starts with picking the right plan of study at my University. The **problem** is that there is no Bachelors in Statistics unfortunately, but there is a minor in Statistics. There's also a Post-Bacc Certificate in Stats, which I don't really know much about and how it works. There's Economics, which I already have a couple prereqs in and am somewhat interested in above all. Professionals in that field have told me that Economics is almost as marketable or even more marketable in some situations as one in Stats if you go math-heavy in your courses. There's also Comp Sci, but the added prereqs would probably set me back behind a year, but I'd like to minor in it if deemed necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

So with that said, let me lay out more details about major requirements/courses and maybe you guys could prescribe the best possible route from here to become **most marketable/skilled/well-rounded in the data science/analytic field**?

&amp;#x200B;

So a **BS in Economics** at my school entails:

\- Prin of Micro AND Macro (Already took Macro in High School)

\- Contemporary Econ Issues

\- Micro AND Macro Theory

\- University Capstone: Labor Econ OR Experimental Econ OR Senior Seminar in Econ

**15 Additional Credit Hours/5 Classes in Upper-Level Econ Courses**; Some of the Important Classes I hear are:

\- Game Theory

\- Business Cycles &amp; Forecasting

\- Intro to Mathematical Econ

\- Intro to Econometrics

\- Advanced Micro/Macro Theory

\- Financial Markets

\- Econometrics

\- Econometric Time-Series Analysis

\- Panel and Nonlinear Methods in Econometrics

&amp;#x200B;

So, without the option to major in Stats and Comp Sci being too much coursework at this point, that leaves a minor in each. Let me just lay out the requirements for each and ask you all whether or not it's worth tacking on either of them, or maybe majoring in Computer Science after all and minoring in Stats...

&amp;#x200B;

So, a **Stats Minor** requires 18 credits when I've already taken 4. It needs 1 Intro Class...

\- Concepts of Statistics

and **4 Upper-Level Classes**, some I've heard are important are

\- Intro to Probability Theory

\- Intro to Statistical Inference

\- Applications of Stats

\- Intro to Statistical Computing

\- Intro to Stochastic Processes

\- Statistical Consulting

\- Applied Stat Computing using R

\- Multivariate Stats

\- Regression

\- Time-Series

\- Statistical Methods

\- Linear Models

&amp;#x200B;

A **Comp Sci Minor** requires...

\- Intro to Programming

\- Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming

And **4 Classes of Upper-Level Courses**, some important classes I hear...

\- Intro to Discrete Structures

\- Intro to Operating Systems

\- Algorithm Analysis with Advanced Data Structures

\- Programming Languages

\- Artificial Intelligence

\- Intro to Quantum Computing

\- Intro to Data Science

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you made it this far, **thank you** so much for bearing with me. Now, with all these requirements, what do you think? Do you think that a BS in Econ with a minor in Stats or Comp Sci suffice? What courses are most important? Can I become as marketable as possible and succeed in this field with these options and courses?

Now, I'm looking to take it a step further and get into unstructured data or text analytics as I have some wonderful ideas in my mind but just don't know how to implement them. 

So, what I'd like to know is how do I start learning about text analytics - not the math part, I have a YT playlist of Stanford I think a couple first vids of which did a pretty good job of introducing me to the concepts. Now, I need to learn about the tools to get working and add to my portfolio. Which models should I start with? Like, in structured data I started with linear models, moved on to CART, ensembles and then to some advanced ones like SVM, Naive Bayes and so on. What will be the roadmap here like? I've heard of a few models like LSTM, TF-IDF, etc but I don't know anything about them and so I'd like to find a list of some important models from simplest to complex models.

I'm going to attend college in the fall and I've decided on Data Science as my major (of course as a freshman this is subject to change but I really want to stick with it).

However, here's the catch: I have no clue how to code or use any language that may be required of me. Should I put myself through the ringer and try to learn some of the things that will be required of me (C#, Python, etc.) or should I expect some of the college classes to begin at starter level (which I know might be a stupid question to ask)?

and showed science/mathematics ends in meaninglessness

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/All-things-are-possible.pdf

2) the theory of evolution ends in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",0,0,False,self,,,,,

I also wasn't quite sure what to search.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Can I use R or Python to quickly identify the drivers of why current week performance is  different from the prior 5 weeks? Is this considered EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)? Will teaching myself how to do this require beginner/intermediate/advanced knowledge of either language? Ideally I'd like to invest under 20 hours to make my life easier for all of time. 

***

I am a self taught ""analyst"", and have become the unofficial official analyst for my team since no one else knows anything beyond excel pivot tables and using filters on published Tableau dashboards. Really I'm just intermediate in SQL and Tableau, so that gives you an idea of my organization's capabilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

In recent weeks I've had a number of projects reassigned so I can focus on the singular task of analyzing our KPIs and delivering a custom written report to our senior leaders. Frankly its quite irritating as a) The task is super repetitive and b) I developed my skills in order to better identify potential projects/articulate the business need for action/present results in a compelling way. My intention wasn't to have all my projects taken away so I can write a report all week. Anyway, I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've been asked to do is to present our KPIs and then explain why performance differs from prior weeks. I've received praise on the ""relevancy"" of my report compared to the ""formulaic"" reports  produced by analysts on other teams. It's nice, but not rewarding enough to justify dragging pills around a Tableau workbook for hours each week to see if anything pops then writing \~2,000 words based on the numbers I see. I envy the analysts on other teams that can just screenshot the same rolling 6 week bar chart and call it a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I am analyzing how the different carriers we work with perform when it comes to delivering our product, so pretty much every week I'm asking:

1. Does this week's performance differ significantly from the prior 5 weeks?
2. If yes, is it because of issues (or lack thereof) on a certain delivery day? Does this day of the week usually perform poorly, or just this week? Are the issues limited to a certain state or zipcode? Does this state or zipcode always perform poorly, or just this week?
3. If no, is it because of issues associated with the day the packages were shipped? Is this day of the week frequently an issue?
4. If issues are not related to the day the product was delivered or the day it was shipped, can they be linked to a certain state or zipcode?
5. Are the reasons people are complaining similarly distributed this week compared to prior weeks?

Throughout my search I came across geopolitical forecasting and signed up for one challenge. It's called GFC2 (Geopolitical Forecasting Challenge 2) and it's organized by IARPA, one of the U.S. government intelligence organizations. 

The challenge starts May 15th, 2019, and runs for 7 months. You can sign-up for it after May 15th but, chances are, you won't finish in a top place.

One thing I like a lot about GFC2 is the story behind it: in a IARPA competition from about 7 years ago, a group of regular people, non-expert forecasters, was able to predict world events with a much higher accuracy than geopolitical experts. IARPA used those findings to improve its forecasting methods.  If you want to know the entire story, you're better off reading the book Super Forecasting. I didn't do the story justice with my little synopsis. 

There is one thing I don't like about GFC2 (so far): I'm not good enough with Python yet so I'm struggling with using the API for the challenge (all communication is API based ). But I'm learning fast so I should at least not embarrass myself completely.

Anyway, I wanted to share the link to [GFC2](https://www.herox.com/IARPAGFChallenge2) in case anyone else likes this kind of challenges.

I am looking for a way to normalize financial data prices, such as TA and raw prices. If you have for example a volume indicator of a market you don't know the maximum, the minimum is 0. With this in mind, how could one approach this issue with not knowing the maximum if not the minimum? The desired scale would be either \[-1, 1\], \[0,1\], \[-10, 10\].

I know you could use something like batch\_normalization, however i am looking for something diffrent from that, i tried manual scaling, however since the data can be so diverse it's difficult to determine the right scale.

1) Use a vector autoregressive model through VARS package
2) Fit an ARIMA to the decomposed remainders, and then fit a linear model (ex. linear regression) to the remainders left from the ARIMA and recombine the estimates, trend and seasonality for the forecast.
3) Use something more out of the box like Prophet, that will incorporate regressors a bit more easily

My  partner and I have been working together trading in finance for  several years  now. Somewhere along the way, we decided to learn Python  to program  some back testing software that we wanted designed to our   specifications. I just took a bunch of intro level courses to get a   basic understanding but I was able to find someone to sort of help/guide   me through the process. Wed have periodic screen shares where we'd   discuss what I was trying to do, he'd lay out his thoughts on how to go   about it, perhaps provide example code etc and I'd spend the next   days/weeks trying do that myself and then we'd reconvene to go over   progress and mistakes etc. I felt this was an excellent way to learn   python while simultaneously applying that knowledge to the project at   hand.

I'm currently doing the same  thing with ML/time series forecasting to tackle  several ongoing  projects we'd like to accomplish. We have some pricing  models that we  hired a 3rd party to develop and I'd like to be able to  add more to  that and develop some different ones in house. I've taken  about 100 or  so hours of Machine Learning courses on line to give me a  general  understanding so I'm looking for a similar relationship to what I   outlined earlier but with more focus on data science and machine   learning. I'm interested in the data scientist approach to tackling the   problem to know best practices with things like data pre-processing,   input selection, model selection and finally training and comparing   several models to arrive at the best one for live use.

We can have sessions/screen shares done remotely as needed. Time of day is very flexible (EST timezone).

If  you are interested I suggest we schedule a call to discuss some more   of the project scope in detail to determine if we'd be a good match to   work together.

I'm just finishing up my first year of undergrad, planning on doing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Math, and I really want to pursue data science. I learned about this field very recently, and I figured it would fit my skills quite nicely as I've always been good at math and dealing with data and numbers, but I didn't necessarily want to go into an engineering field. 

  
I've read around and done some googling and redditing, and I've found a few things that I want some information on as to whether they are true at all:

1. In order to be a data scientist, you need to know Python and R and have a very strong math background
2. A master's degree is almost required to get any sort of DS job
3. DS concepts are better learned online than in a classroom setting

&amp;#x200B;

I've come up with these conceptions about the whole DS field, and I don't know if any of them are correct in any way, but as a freshman in college I just want to know where to start. I've heard from some people that I should learn Python, as it will take me the furthest; my university teaches R in several statistics courses here; I've heard from others that I need to know SQL and C++ and C; and from others I've heard to just learn Matlab. So, for any seasoned data scientists out there: What do you actually use most often in your field and how could a young college student like myself have the best chances for succeeding later on? Would you recommend learning any specific programs / languages? What do you actually do for your job?

To use this tool, one often requires that the data are *independent and identically distributed*. However, this hypothesis is violated by time series, where successive data points are interdependent.

Many cross-validation packages, such as scikit-learn, rely on the independence hypothesis and thus cannot help for time series. To solve this problem, I developed a python package [TSCV](https://github.com/WenjieZ/TSCV), which enables cross-validation for time series without the requirement of the independence.

The intuition behind this package is that, by introducing **gaps** between the training set and the test set, the temporal dependence can be mitigated. Hence, after introducing the gap, **leaving p out**, **K-Fold**, and so forth are once again valid. Researches show that cross-validation with gaps outperforms the one without gaps.

The best feature of this package is that **it works seamlessly with scikit-learn**. You can pass every class, aka cross-validator, in my package as the `cv` argument to the `cross_validate` function in scikit-learn. Indeed, my package is designed as an extension for scikit-learn, instead of being a standalone package itself.

**SAS Programming &amp; the Big Data**

&amp;#x200B;

![img](q3hpqoqz6iy21 ""SAS online Course "")

**Lets start with the most fundamental question; what is SAS programming?**

The SAS language is a programming language and also a powerful machine learning research tool. It is used for statistical analysis and is an ideal platform for numerically sensitive applications and larger data sources. Machine learning today is a mathematically rigorous discipline that encompasses sophisticated modeling, optimization, and learning research; it has concrete applications in healthcare, software, robotics, and traditional business problems. There is significant overlap among the fields of data science, data mining, and machine learning, particularly in the business problem domain. SAS have provided advanced data mining and machine learning capabilities for yearsbeginning long before the current buzz. Moreover, SAS has continually incorporated advances in machine learning research into its classification, prediction, and segmentation procedures.Many machine learning procedures and resources are being offered by SAS Enterprise Miner. The power tools for prediction and classification include high-performance neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. High-performance clustering allows the user to segment his or her biggest available data. The endless list of benefits bestowed by SAS opens the door for who who want to learn programming and want to familiarize themselves with this language. The salary of a SAS user can vary between $25,000 and $80,000 a year. 

**History and evolution of big data analytics**

You already might be knowing what is data analytics, so let's dive down into its history. The concept of big data isnt something new. The idea has been around for many years; most organizations now understand that if they are able to grasp all the data that flows into their businesses, they can apply analytics and get significant value from it. In the 1950s which was decades before anyone uttered the term big data, businesses were using basic analytics to uncover insights and trends which was essentially numbers in a spreadsheet that were manually examined. Speed and efficiency are some of the 2 new benefits that big data analytics brings to the table. Because of that, today that business can identify insights for immediate decisions, whereas a few years ago, a business would have gathered information, run analytics and unearthed information that could be used for future decisions. Being able to work faster while staying agile gives organizations a competitive edge they didnt have before.

To know about big data and its capabilities, you can read ****[**What is Big Data &amp; How Can it Change the World**](https://blog.eduonix.com/bigdata-and-hadoop/what-is-big-data-how-can-change-world/)****.

**Why is Big Data Analytics Important?**

Big data analytics help organizations and businesses to harness their data and utilize it to identify new opportunities. This makes a profound contribution to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits, and satisfied customers. 

In his report, Big Data in Big Companies, Tom Davenport who is the director of Research at IIA interviewed more than 50 businesses to understand how they used big data. He discovered that the businesses got their value in these 3 key ways:

**Cost reduction.** When it comes to storing large amounts of data, big data technologies such as Hadoop and cloud-based analytics bring significant cost advantagesmoreover, they are able to identify more efficient ways of doing business.

**Faster, better decision making.** It helped businesses to analyze information rapidly for making quick decisions. It is mainly because of the in-memory analytics, fast speed of Hadoop and its ability to analyze new sources of data.

**New products and services.** Being capable of satisfying customer needs and satisfaction through analytics comes to the power to give customers what they want. Davenport points believe that with big data analytics, more number of companies and businesses are creating new products to meet the demands of their customers

**Whos using it?**

Any business that relies on quick and agile decisions to keep an edge over the competition. Many believe that big data is pivotal when it comes to keeping businesses soaring with success. Heres how different types oforganizations might use the technology:

**1. Life Sciences**

Clinical research is a slow and expensive process, with trials failing for a variety of reasons. Advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) unlocks the potential of improving speed and efficiency at every stage of clinical research by delivering more intelligent, automated solutions.

**2. Banking**

Financial institutions gather and access analytical insight from large volumes of unstructured data in orderto make sound financial decisions. Big data analytics allows them to access the information they need when they need it, by eliminating overlapping, redundant tools, and systems.

**3. Manufacturing**

For manufacturers, solving problems is nothing new. They wrestle with difficult problems on a daily basis - from complex supply chains to motion applications, to labor constraints and equipment breakdowns. Saving costs and revenue opportunities are just some of the reasons whybig data is imperative in the manufacturing industry.

**4. Health Care**

Big data is given in the health care industry. Details such as Patient records, health plans, insurance information and other various types of information can be difficult to manage manuallybut they are full of key insights once analytics is applied. Thats why big data analytics technology is so important to health care. By analyzing large amounts of informationboth structured and unstructuredquickly, health care providers can provide lifesaving diagnoses or treatment options almost immediately.

**5. Government**

Tightening the budget without compromising quality or productivity is a challenge certain government agencies can face.Law enforcement agencies can face such issues, mainly which are struggling to keep crime rates down with relatively scarce resources. And thats why many agencies use big data analytics; the technology streamlines operations while giving the agency a more holistic view of criminal activity.

**6. Retail**

Like almost everything customer service has passed through the evolution process in a way it aids them to understand the needs of the customer. It can be the kind ofproduct they need, where do they need it and when do they need it.Big data analytics technology helps retailers meet those demands. From customer loyalty programs, buying habits, and other sources, the never-ending ocean of data helps the retailer develop a deeper understanding of their customers and also predict future trends, therebyboosting profitability.

In my company, there is a ML model for antifraud in Sagemaker using XGBoost. 

We switched a couple of months ago from Amazon Machine Learning to this model just taking data previous to 2019 as training/validation data and data in 2019 as testing data and comparing the recall and false positive rate of both models. And that's it. In this case I think that approach was good enough because the differences were substantially big (0.6 against 0.9).

However, there are things that we want to test such as addition/elimination of variables, different resampling methods for dealing with the unbalanced dataset, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics etc which might have a little impact on the evaluation metrics...So I have been thinking and I believe that a proper method would be to make A/B tests with k-fold cross-validation for each of this things.

For instance, let's say that the model have now X variables, and I want to test if a model with X-1 would be better. Then the procedure I would to is the following:
-Run Y times(15-20 would be enough?) the cross validation with X variables
-Take the average of one metric (i.e recall) amongst the Y results
-Run Y times the cross validation with X - 1 variables
-Take the average of recall among this new Y results
-Make a hypothesis test comparing both averages and draw a conclusion from this result

Would that be enough? If so, what happens with multiple changes? If I conclude that X - 1 variables is better and then I want to test Under sampling vs Over sampling, could I start from the model with X - 1 variables or could be that there is any case in which the combination of X variables with Under sampling/over sampling is better than X - 1 variables + under sampling/over sampling?

But the key to repeatable ML results is also to keep proper versioning of not only their data but the code and configuration files, and to automate processing steps. Successful projects sometimes requires collaboration with colleagues, which is made easier through cloud storage systems.

My partner and I have been working for this on a couple weeks and feel that we're just out of our depth and unsure how to proceed. I'll describe the dataset first, what we are hoping to do, and the steps we've taken thus far. All analysis is being done in R studio.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The dataset:

Enrollment in a state-based health insurance exchange. Each row contains

*  an application ID and person ID which should allow us to track the person across time; 
* demographic data including age group, race, year of birth, income as a % of Federal Poverty Level, and ZIP code; 
* plan information including the carrier, type of plan, plan premium, plan deductible, actuarial value, tax credit (binary yes no), and plan year; 
* enrollment data including the enrollment status (disenrolled, disenrollment initiated, coverage end initiated, canceled, in progress, initiated, change in enrollment, renewal initiated, renewal modified, confirmed, active) and the enrollment start and end dates (as POSIX variables).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The ask:

To determine if enrollment behavior can be predicted for $X change in premiums, taking into account the other variables that may influence enrollment as listed above. We'd like to explore this from multiple avenues including clustering, regression, neural networks, and SVM.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Steps so far:

We've created a few dataframes that will work for different models and algorithms. The base dataframe has a lot of categorical, nominal variables as factors (age group, actuarial level, FPL, race, gender, enrollment status) with some discrete, numerical variables (premium, deductible) and the two identifying numerical variables (application ID and person ID). We then created a numeric dataframe with all of the categorical variables either recoded as ordered numeric when appropriate (ie: age group with ""0-17"" recoded as 0 and ""65+"" recoded as 6) or dummified (race turns into several binary variables).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Our question is this; how would you folks approach this? We have now a numeric dataframe that can be put through different models, but we aren't sure how to do that. For example, how do we turn this into a time series so we can analyze the trends over time? We'd ideally like to examine them by plan year, looking at how the different individuals behaved within the market and the aspects of their plans and demographics each year. But R only accepts date objects as the time series indicator and the year is considered numeric. How do we ""track"" the people across time? We should be able to since we have the IDs, right? Some ideas we've had so far are to split the data into yearly dataframes and analyze each year individually, then compare **or** to create variables that have the change in variables represented (easy for things like premium, more difficult for things like the plan though that could be a binary indication of new plan/continued plan?). I'm sorry if this seems trivial or simple, we've been trying to figure this out on our own and thought it might help to bring in some experts with real world knowledge.

If you know of any, please suggest them.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got a job as a researcher in the machine learning (ML) industry (NLP, specifically) - hooray! Unfortunately, my background is not in CS/STEM \*at all\*, and I'm quite weak on the quant side of things. So I plan to spend as long as it takes to brush up on my basic math skills, including calculus, linear algebra, stats, and probability/combinatorics. As I understand it, those topics are all essential for a career in ML. But for someone in my shoes, it feels like an overwhelming amount of material to absorb, much of it for the first time. Since no human could retain every esoteric fact and arcane formula in all of those fields simultaneously, I'm looking for a way to prioritize what I learn.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm wondering is, \*\*for an ML career, must one know dozens (hundreds?) of specific formulas and other details regarding how to solve this or that type of equation? Or is it usually sufficient to just understand the concepts in the field and the meaning behind the numbers? In other words, would your standard ML researcher have the skills to ace a typical college math exam? Or are most career ML-ers generally familiar with only the high-level concepts while being rusty on some of the details?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I knew how to formulate that question in a less clunky and verbose manner. So \*\*before I get downvoted for asking what might just sound like ""Do I really have to study that hard?"", consider this analogy:\*\* The math of statistics can get insanely complicated and require a PhD in stats to understand. Despite this, \*many, many people use stats at their jobs without a PhD or really any understanding at the computational level. This is possible thanks to the wealth of stats software packages out there (e.g., SPSS, SAS).\* Because these programs take care of the number-crunching, for the majority of people in stats-heavy fields, it's sufficient to just understand stats on a conceptual level, not a mathematical level. As long as I know what tests to run on my data and what the outputs mean conceptually, I can do stats, no problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is basically an analogy to that, but for ML, and for calculus and linear algebra instead of stats. As I study these fields I will certainly try my best to unlock and retain a mathematical understanding of everything, but surely some of the specific formulas etc. will slip my mind as my brain saturates. When that happens, would it be alright if I simply seek to understand the concepts/meaning behind the numbers?

A digital marketing masters is not worth the time and money, my personal opinion.

\- Company has a problem affecting their bottom line involving individuals of interest. Organizationally, the problems are already known. The company usually has no data infrastructure.

\- They hire data consultants. The consultants usually have a few Ph.D.s running their operation.

\- The consultants say that they can solve the problem with ""data science,"" ""machine learning,"" ""artificial intelligence,"" and/or ""deep learning."" 

\- If it's a ""deep learning"" problem, the company works with consultants over a multi-year process because it takes that long to train the model.

\- They track these individuals of interest and give each individual a score out of 100 in terms of how problematic they are to the company's bottom line, according to a model. They claim that they've taken many or every variable that they can get out of these individuals from the company's data, and that was how the model was generated.

\- Months or years go by, and the company realizes they were ripped off.

I've seen this happen too many times now, and it's making me consider leaving working in data professionally entirely. I'm usually the one person in the room in these meetings with these consultants with company executives asking difficult questions, and everyone usually thinks I'm there to just show off.

1. Is the Ds responsible for how their work is consumed by the end user or is that the responsibility of another Dev team to consume and integrate it? If another team, what does that team look like?
2. What is the Ds role relative to hardware to get their day to day Dev work done? Assumption is most work initially done on small data sets on laptops/desktops and likely chosen by Ds in small org, imposed on by it with Ds input in larger orgs.
3. What is ds role relative to production training and inference? Are they responsible for architecture or is that responsibility of devops or it? Are they stakeholders with input or do they merely need to conform to a standard (for example kubernetes used, so need to deliver as container)?

I am the team lead of the data science and analytics team in a med size engineering company. Our tasks revolve around failure analysis, spectroscopy models, mining production data to optimize processes and so on. Generally it is extremely interesting work that involves a lot of math, inferential statistics, sometimes classical ML, occasionally DL (mostly for fun) and a lot of visualization. I am in a great relationship with my boss, VP of Research, who reports directly to the CEO and de facto second in command in our bigger multidisciplinary research team. 

Earlier this year my boss told me that she would like me to become a manager in my own right and take on more organizational tasks. As an incentive the data science team would break out as an independent department serving the needs of the company as a whole, not research first and other departments second. I would have the opportunity to grow the team (we are 4 now) and it goes without saying that the salary would get adjusted accordingly. 

The cost however is that I will no longer be able to spend any significant amount of time doing data science work directly. It would have to be done by proxy of my team. I would set the goals, define priorities, review the work, etc. in other words this is almost a 90 degrees turn on the career path. The focus shifts from technical to business and company needs, customer needs and so on. That is no more thinking how to best setup a PGM to describe and explain the results of experiments that the optics team is running in the lab. 

Alternatively I could just continue to grow as a data scientist. But I am afraid to be too expensive as a front line engineer in 15 - 20 years. Ive seen it happen before. Guys who spent their entire life doing the engineering work are too expensive by the time they are 50 and are the first ones to be laid off when the times are not so great. In addition our area of research is niche, and while I can easily find transferable skills into other industries, it will be something I will have to proof to potential employers should I decide to change job. 

Has anyone do something similar? How does  running the team as a team lead (kinda first among equals who reviews the work and advices on the best approach) compares to the data science management? Any regrets?",25,107,False,self,,,,,

I'm stuck with a certain hypothesis in my thesis. 

I've conducted a survey which gives a result for the motivation of students in SPSS. 

There are 325 students of the same school, but there's a difference in faculty (2), language (2: Dutch &amp; French) and of course gender (independent variables). For every student, I've calculated the autonomous and controlled motivation (dependent variables) via this survey. 

Most of my hypotheses are already tested, using independent samples t-tests. For example for the hypothesis: ""Female students have a higher autonomous motivation than male students"", or ""French speaking students have a higher autonomous motivation than Dutch speaking students"". 

But I don't know how to test the following hypotheses: ""\[All\] the students in the school have a higher autonomous than controlled motivation"". So now I don't want to make a distinction between the different independent variables, but I want to test which kind of motivation is the highest. I already have the means for autonomous motivation (M=4,85; SD=1,06) and for controlled motivation (M=3,90; SD= 0,86). So I'm quite sure that the hypothesis is true, but how do I prove this? How do I determine if this is significant? Which t-test do I use? A paired-sample t-test or not? Or is it allowed to just accept the hypothesis on basis of the higher mean?

 What I found to be most helpful was:

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;**How do I become a Data Scientist?**  
&gt;  
&gt;The roadmap given to aspiring data scientists can be boiled down to three steps:  
&gt;  
&gt;1.) Earning an undergraduate and/or advanced degree in computer science, statistics, or mathematics,  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2.) Building their portfolio of SQL, Python, and R skills, and  
  
&gt;  
&gt;3.) Getting related work experience through technical internships.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;I'm a... How do I Become a Data Scientist?  
&gt;  
&gt;**I'm a High School Student, How Do I become a Data Scientist?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**I'm a Freshman/Sophomore, How Do I become a Data Scientist?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**I'm a Junior/Senior, How Do I become a Data Scientist?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**I'm a New BS Graduate, How Do I become a Data Scientist?**  
&gt;  
&gt;etc...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What Should I Learn? What Order Do I Learn Them?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*This answer assumes your academic background ends with a HS diploma in the US.*  
&gt;  
&gt;1.) Python  
&gt;  
&gt;2.) Differential Calculus  
&gt;  
&gt;3.) Integral Calculus  
&gt;  
&gt;4.) Multivariable Calculus  
&gt;  
&gt;5.) Linear Algebra  
&gt;  
&gt;6.) Probability  
&gt;  
&gt;7.) Statistics

&amp;#x200B;

I think the first section was very helpful, but the issue I have with it and the second section are the fact that I earned my B.A. already. I know it's taking things a bit literal, but I'm not limited to either a HS education nor do I have a B.S. 

Which leaves me to wondering what my next step should be. Is it possible to look at graduate school without a B.S.? If so, what skills should I accumulate first? Should I acquire these skills by earning certs or taking additional classes or should I try and find entry level work?

&amp;#x200B;

If I should take additional classes, do you guys have any recommendations? 

&amp;#x200B;

If I should take a job, what would be the best course of action in convincing someone to hire me or let me even apply for an internship?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I purposefully titled the question as ""Data Science/Analytics"" because I realize that while the two words and used interchangeably a lot of the time, they are in fact unique fields that often do different things. I'm not exactly sure how far I want to take myself, but I do know that I enjoy statistics and numbers, even though I earned a B.A. Writing and Rhetoric. I had to do tons of research in a lot of papers I wrote and finding and compiling data in some of my college projects was the most fun I had.

I'm an amateur programmer wondering if I could get some opinions from people who deal with statistics/data on what I'm about to do. It's fairly simple compared to the other questions in here.

I want to grab and analyze some data from gilded posts on redddit. As you all know, Reddit now has three tiers of gildings - silver, gold, and plat. Each costs different amounts. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see how the average ratio of platinum:gold:silver given to highly gilded posts compares to the 1800:500:100 ratio of cost in reddit coins and maybe make a DataIsBeatiful post about it. Just as a side project.

Now, I understand that other factors such as monthly free coins and users usually not gilding more than once come into play, but I want to ignore that for now and just total up an average.

Reddit's API (I might use [pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/) but idk how updated everything in the dumps are) doesn't allow me to get all posts with silver and above - I can only grab all submissions that have at least one gold or platinum award. I could do a tedious scan of all posts since October 2018 when the plat and silver awards were released to find the total number of awards given out since then, but I assume that'd take too long.

I've decided to just analyze all posts and comments submitted after October 2018 that have *at least one of each award*. I want to find the ""average ratio"" (plat:gold:silver) for gildings on all posts and comments that have these three awards, and maybe make a separate ratio for comments and posts. I'm pretty good at math but I haven't taken any sort of statistics course, so I was wondering if you guys would be willing to give your input on the following:

1. Is the best way to find an ""average ratio"" to just total up the number of silvers, golds, and plats on all these posts and then simplify the ""total"" ratio?
2. Is there anything about my approach that could be tweaked to make my findings more interesting/accurate or more analysis I could do with that data to find out different things?
3. Should I factor in posts with only gold (and possibly silver) awards? I wasn't sure how to do so, and I thought just sticking with the posts and comments with all three awards would make it simpler.
4. A user named ChrisCGC gilds all the time. He tends to gild a lot of stuff with one of each award, or 10 silver 10 gold 10 plat or something like that. If you go through his comments, you can see that he gilds very regularly, and I thought that if I factored him out of the ratio it would be more representative of reddit's normal site behavior. So, I've omitted all posts from subreddits he visits regularly, as he pretty much gilds any comment in a discussion with/about him or about DMT and most of the gilds in those subreddits are from him. This is, I believe, because his usual 1:1:1 or 20:20:20 or whatever gilding ratio would skew mine. Does this line of reasoning make sense to you guys? I'm not sure if maybe I'm overthinking that and his gilding won't really affect the ratio that much. I personally think it would, though.

Hi guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large dataset about flight searches.(\~10 mill. rows)

&amp;#x200B;

The interesting columns are:

&amp;#x200B;

[params.city](https://params.city/) \--- Name of a city

date --- date ( maybe i dont have to use this)

tracking\_id --- the ID of a customer

&amp;#x200B;

My boss wants me to show him which cities where searched usually after the most popular cities.

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

&amp;#x200B;

In case of New York City i want to see which cities where the most common to follow New York City.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that somebody can helps me out!

If u need any more information then i'm more than happy to give more.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently use our Teamcity build system as a glorified front-end over HTCondor. We have binary executables that perform each workflow, and the build system triggers bash scripts that invoke these executables on a regular schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

This solution has survived up to 300+ cores, 1+ TB of new data daily, 10+ ""build"" steps, and hourly schedule. But I need to design something for at least 1 order of magnitude increase in pipeline complexity, number of jobs and pipelines, more schedules, more cores, and data throughput. This isn't that great because of:

\- **Immature support for containers and dependency management.** It's difficult to manage data versioning and reproduce errors because our libraries/binaries are built and installed on each bare metal host in the cluster, whose states are mutable. Our hacky workaround is to replicate container-like behavior by storing the versions of libraries/binaries used for each job submission in folders with descriptive IDs/names.

\- **Weak front-end to visualize and manage job failures.** To be fair, I feel our approach is a lot better than folks using a bunch of cron jobs, and the build system frontend is a lot more powerful than any cluster middleware or job scheduler (like Slurm, Condor, SGE) on its own. But I wish it was easier to **search through logs**, **restart failed jobs**,

\- **No direct support for clustering.** Modern tools like Airflow at least have native scale out with Celery/Mesos. Teamcity is not cluster-aware so we have to make it poll for certain error codes written out in our Condor cluster logs.

\- **Expensive.** Licensing costs for build agents grows at a faster rate than number of cores.

\- **Lack of expressive support for pipelines.** Teamcity has a GUI approach to build chains; HTCondor's DAGs are OK but old school compared to the code-as-config paradigm we have these days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering using:

\- **Airflow.** Doesn't support a proper HPC cluster middleware like Condor, doesn't seem to be battle-tested for performance in large clusters with petabytes of storage and thousands of heterogenous cores.

\- **Nextflow.** Doesn't have a scheduler? Lack of features to handle failures and job dependencies from the front-end?",5,3,False,self,,,,,

(I'm a physicist).

&amp;#x200B;

After a lot of research I created a series of articles entitled ""Machine Learning for the Data Fabric"". You can read the first part here:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/05/data-fabric-machine-learning-part-1.html](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/05/data-fabric-machine-learning-part-1.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Here I propose a different definition of machine learning, focusing on a new paradigm, the data fabric.  

&amp;#x200B;

In this article I did three main things:  

&amp;#x200B;

\- Give a description of the data fabric and ecosystems to create it. 

\- Explain in a few words what is machine learning. 

\- Propose a way of visualizing machine learning insights inside of the data fabric.  

&amp;#x200B;

The main theory behind it is that if we can construct a data fabric that supports all the data in the company, then a business insight inside of it can be thought as a dent in it. The automatic process of discovering what that insight is, its called machine learning.

Im working on a platform for deploying machine learning pipelines which manages feature preparation, model training, and prediction serving. After trying to ship TensorFlow code to production, I was frustrated by the amount of time I had to spend on manually setting up infrastructure, managing dependencies, and orchestrating data pipelines. 

My friend and I started gluing together popular open source building blocks (Spark, TensorFlow Serving, Kubernetes, etc.) into a single tool. We wanted to automate the DevOps so we could spend more time on the actual data science.

You can try it out by installing it into any AWS account and deploying your existing code (via TensorFlow [Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator)).

Id really appreciate your feedback!

I've been racking my head around building a chatbot with the benefits of Retrieval-based bot, especially in a domain  specific environment. I like the idea of being able to extract intents and entities from client text to then complete an action like pulling payment information or something similar. 

However, I also like the idea of using some sort of translation model or seq2seq to automatically learn what it should say to a client. The downfall here is the bot ends up providing incorrect payment info to a client. 

I'm hoping to find some sort of happy middle ground? Maybe I could use a generative portion of the bot to maintain the general conversation with the client until the retrieval portion is confident enough in an action? 

I have also considered building a reinforcement learning bot to make the decision whether to continue using the generative or retrieval based bot. I think this could be a really interesting concept but I'm getting the feeling I'm over complicating the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some help with a scoring system and thought you might have a better idea how to tackle this.

The goal is to score data based on how frequently specific values occur.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I have 100 events of various value distribution:

1. All events have the same value (`events_a`):
2. Most of the events have the same value, one value occured only once (`events_b`)
3. Most of the events have the same value, multiple values occur only once (`events_c`).

&amp;#8203;

    events_a = {'a': 100}
    events_b = {'a': 70, 'b': 29, 'c': 1}
    events_c = {'a': 70, 'b': 20, 'c': 1, 'd':1, 'e':1, 'f':1, 'g':1, 'h':1, 'i':1, 'j':1, 'k':1, 'l':1}

Score should reflect how 'anomalous' is the occurence. So for `events_a` new event with value `a` should have score 0, but new event with value `b` should have score 1.

The occurence of a new value should have a high score in `events_b`, but not as high in `events_c`, considering there are multiple events of single occurence.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering the amount of data I need to process I tried to not overthink it and came up with a very simple scoring based on an exponential function:

    def score_events(events):
    	return {(k,round( float(sum(events.values()) - v)/float((  math.exp(0.18 * len(events))  *sum(events.values()))), 3)) for k, v in events.items()}

The results for the three dictionaries are:

    RESULT FOR EVENTS_A: set([('a', 0.0)])
    RESULT FOR EVENTS_B: set([('a', 0.175), ('c', 0.577), ('b', 0.414)])
    RESULT FOR EVENTS_C: set([('d', 0.114), ('k', 0.114), ('a', 0.035), ('j', 0.114), ('c', 0.114), ('g', 0.114), ('i', 0.114), ('f', 0.114), ('b', 0.092), ('l', 0.114), ('h', 0.114), ('e', 0.114)])

My biggest concerns are:

* It does not 'punish' enough new occurences in shorts sets, value `c` in `events_b` should have a higher score.
* The length of the sets varies from 1 to over 100k. Single-occurence events have a very similar (low) scores in both with lenght of 25 and 10k.

&amp;#x200B;

The use of more advanced models might not be a viable option due to the amount of data and available resources. So the simpler the better.

I am new to Pandas and am experimenting with algorithms to rate the probability of a stock price going up or down over the next X ticks.

For example, if a stock price is moving like:

$1,$ 2, $3, then what is the probability that it will be $4 within the next X ticks.

To do that I need a very large sample set (which I do). My problem is, in the training set I need to tell Pandas to not try to calculate the probability of the first Y rows of data. It needs to use that as ""seed"" data instead. The reason is obvious...it can't calculate probability for the initial rows of data since it has no historical knowledge.

Is there a way to do that? I'm sure there is, but I'm not able to find it in Google searches or the Pandas documentation.

I did some looking around in the sub, and I didn't see Lambda's DS program discussed much, aside from one good review.  I'm considering their full-time program ( [https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science/](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science/) ).  It's a 9 month program that covers most of the basics and is supposedly fairly rigorous.  For those working in the field, would someone with my background as a working biotech consultant be a serious candidate ($100-150k target salary) coming out of a program like this? I've done some learning of the basics already, but with full-time work and trying to have a life, it's been slow and demotivating. I graduated from school about 7 years ago, but when I was there I worked with Matlab/Python, Linear Algebra, DiffEq, Calc I-III, and some advanced engineering mathematics courses (though I use none of that day-to-day and it feels foggy at this point).  


The opportunity cost for me is pretty steep, as I'd quit my six-figure job to pursue this full time for 9 months. On top of that, you repay $30k over 2 years as part of an Income Share Agreement.  Additionally, /r/learnprogramming has some negative reviews of the school. I'd probably be using up most of my savings to make this transition, so I'm trying to gather as many data points as possible before I make the decision. I'm going to try to pivot out of my pigeonhole regardless, and my other path right now would be hustling to study for the GMAT and aim for a top 10 MBA program starting in the Fall of next year.  Any advice from you smart cats would be much appreciated!

I have been eyeballing data science for a year or so because I love math, solving shit and want to get more into coding and machine learning.

I want honest advice on my learning process. i have somewhat of a loose plan in place. I am in no rush, my goal is summer 2020, but I am spending time almost everyday on progressing myself towards my goal. This isn't the first time I changed careers so I know how to hustle and get shit done, but I know this will be a whole other animal. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the plan: 

1. Learn Python (already started - early) 
   1. Right now I am just watching YouTube videos, is there a recommended course I should take? I am willing to pay for a credible course, especially if it is geared towards data science/machine learning.
      1.  [https://www.udemy.com/automate/](https://www.udemy.com/automate/) 
      2. &amp;#x200B;
   2. Do I need to learn Python with a certain thing in mind as I get more advanced? The goal was to also use it for other things, so I was just going to become proficient in it. 
2. Learn the different types of math. 
   1. Pretty much just read books and learn it like I did in school. 
3. Applying knowledge to tangible projects for a resume. 
   1. I am not getting too ahead of myself yet, just taking the first basic baby steps at the moment. I havent even started to think about this part yet. Should I? 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not want to go back to college, I work full time and just don't know if I want to do that. I am pretty self sufficient so I don't need a school to get me to do this stuff. I have debated going to a bootcamp, but again I feel pretty confident I can go without it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering though, if there are data science courses online that anyone has taken? Ill list out a few that I have been looking at, but want to make sure its worth it for these specific courses. They get pricey..

5.  [https://www.udemy.com/topic/data-science/](https://www.udemy.com/topic/data-science/) \- Any of these on Udemy?
6. I have also heard data quest is good.

They have a well established data scientists team but somehow I was entrusted to carry out a long-term DS project on my own unlike the other interns who mainly do EDA on small projects. In fact I work most of the time with domain experts, although I do have a designated data scientist mentor on the team to who I report to and who is very willing to help. Nonetheless they are giving me so much autonomy that I pretty much have to choose on my own how I structure the project. My biggest fear is that I do a big rookie mistake, that it goes unnoticed and that it will heavily impact the future of the project. 

The non DS guys also assume I know everything about DS and math, and I don't know how to react as I think I know the answer, but I'm not totally confident about it. They also expect me to do solo presentations on the project pretty frequently; I'm clearly bad at this although I think I'm improving.

Also I'm scared I'm missing out on usual interns benefits, like training on best practices and so on. On the other hand though, I have legit computational ressources, and I'm free to choose how I spend my time, either on research or development. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I've been given too much autonomy or is it a good experience to have before my actual first DS job ?",19,17,False,self,,,,,

I've been looking into a career change lately (12 years of freelance marketing and basic web development) and I stumbled into a few areas of interest. One of them being data science (I'm new, so be gentle please if I say something stupid, I'm still learning). 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm interested in data science, but I'm not sure if my idea of what I want to do is within the realm of it, or just uses it sometimes. I've learned a little about the different roles inside of Data Science like Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Business Intelligence. I find it interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I THINK that what I'm interested in might be called ""Digital Analyst"" but I'm not sure if that is a well-received term or something a bit controversial (like ""Growth Hacker""). 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what I enjoy is: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Reviewing a businesses previous metrics and analytics to find how it's performing and where it can improve by adding, removing or augmenting parts of the website, marketing campaigns, customer demographic exposure etc or anything else like that. 
* Creating a hypothesis to prove/disprove and following a kind of Scientific Method to running tests to reach a successful and profitable end result for the business
* Implementing the changes and managing reports
* Reviewing and iterating the changes to continuously improve

&amp;#x200B;

I like to focus mostly on just 3 areas: 

&amp;#x200B;

a. increasing the amount of converting/paying customers

b. increasing the amount of profit per transaction

c. increasing the rate at which they come back to repurchase or recommend others to the business

&amp;#x200B;

I usually go with the: Build, Measure, Learn MVP process that is rather popular in Lean Startup circles. 

&amp;#x200B;

The MEASURE and LEARN part uses some aspects of Data Science it seems, but I think it would be a laughable amount for any real expert perhaps because it's mostly just gathering the data, filtering what's useful and discarding what's not, maintaining it and tracking it, and then when you get your results ensuring they are statistically significant ( I believe that's the correct term) then presenting findings to client so that the changes can either be made (if not already) and the next test iteration can begin. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this what I DON'T want to do, or LIKE to do more accurately is put is anything AI or Machine Learning. At least not yet, not because I doubt it's efficacy, I think it's obviously amazing! I just don't really get it yet, and it's likely something for later, if at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this Data Science in a nutshell? Or a sub-sect of it? Or perhaps a totally different thing that just touches on it in some areas of the work? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate the help. My belief is that it's likely one these: Growth Hacking, Conversion Rate Optimization or Digital Analyst but I really don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little worried about getting tore apart for asking a dumb question, but I don't know who else to ask as I don't know anyone in Data Science. 

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I know this sounds like it might be in the wrong sub to some people but it is a question about the Data Science and Data Analytics aspect of what I'm looking for, so I appreciate letting me keep this here and get some advice. I'd be more than happy to delete or remove it later if you think it's necessary.",10,21,False,self,,,,,

I want to do some analysis on League of Legends, a popular MOBA game. 

The following link is where I got the data: [http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/](http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/)

This link is what I have roughly outlined in terms of designing all the tables: [https://imgur.com/UF5aMFr](https://imgur.com/UF5aMFr)

(I forgot to add a Team Dimension which would contain all the teams that participated in the Spring Split)

&amp;#x200B;

How would I go about linking all the tables together?

I was thinking of: 

1. Connecting the League Dimension to the Team Dimension.
2. Connecting the Team Dimension to the Game Dimension.
3. Also connecting the Time Dimension to the Game Dimension
4. Connecting the Game Dimension to the Kill Stats, Objective, Creeps, Vision, Gold, and Experience Dimension. Game ID would be the Foreign key in the connecting dimensions.

I had a talk with my manager, shortly after my previous post here. She doesn't really know much (I'm probably being generous, she doesn't know shit) about Data Science and Machine Learning, but she assured me that she'd get me in touch with a BI and Analytics team.

I decided to see how it goes, continued my stay here for the time being, whilst looking for jobs elsewhere nevertheless. I haven't gotten lucky on the job hunt.

A few weeks later, she initiated talks with the BI and Analytics team, and there could be an opening there, but there's no certainty that I'd get to work with them as they're looking for exactly one person, and I might have to compete with about 2-3 senior team members.

Nevertheless, I get a call from my manager today, telling me that I have a week to learn enterprise level ChatBot development with C# and NodeJS, due to two enterprise level ChatBot developers with 5+ years of experience each leaving the company.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past month, I have been working through the free Data Analyst Path modules on DataQuest and enjoyed it despite Python being difficult to understand at times for a complete beginner. The course itself appears high quality, however, as I have no experience studying with other course providers, I can't be objective.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to quit my current contract PPI Investigator job at a large bank for a number of reasons;

&amp;#x200B;

* Work is boring and unfulfilling
* Chronic stress from extreme targets and nit-picky QA department when checking the quality of your cases
* Frequent migraines
* 2 hours of commuting per day
* No time to visit my local gym
* To study Data Analytics!
* I live with my mum so costs are low (1000 GBP per month)
* I have around 16,000 GBP in savings.
* No kids
* I'm 34 and wish for a professional well-paying career rather than switching from horrible job to horrible job as I have done these past 18 months. I feel like I need to do something drastic!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a degree in Psychology and I'm a fully qualified AAT Technician (Accountancy). I also have advanced Excel skills.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I am facing is that the progress of studying an hour or a day to be too slow and I hate spending weekends studying. Some days don't study as I am often too tired from working my job and it's associated stress. Furthermore, an inch of progress per day is quite demotivating.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is too quit my job this week with an end date of the 28 June 2019. For 60 days post 28 June 2019, I plan on doing a self-imposed bootcamp of sorts by studying at home/library 4-6 hours per day and going back to the gym. In the past 18 months I have put on a lot of weight and so will be going gym/cycling daily.

&amp;#x200B;

This should be sufficient to complete the DataQuest Data Analyst Path and perhaps complete a few projects to help build a portfolio/Linkedin profile. Perhaps, it will also be enough to start applying for entry level Data Analyst roles in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

In this time frame, I'd make 6-8 months or more progress in the space of 2 months. If I can't find a Data Analyst job immediately afterwards, it's not an issue. I would probably find a short-term contract to see me through and then study 1-2 hours per daily to continue making progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone think this is a viable strategy?

Would any recommend I do a different course instead or perhaps accompany it with Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree?

I've been lurking for a while. I want to share some of my knowledge and experience of being a data analyst and data scientist with a bachelor degree. I don't have Masters or PhD. So, in my case, you can be a DS without Masters/PhD. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 34 years old and have been self-teaching myself data science for about 8 months. I switched career from being an entrepreneur/self-employed to a data analyst. I have been a data analyst for 1.5 yrs and then a data scientist for about 1.5 yrs.

  
How did I end up here? Mainly through networking and through connections. I taught myself python (through corey schaffer and udemy) and sql (mainly on [sqlbolt.com](https://sqlbolt.com) great resources). This was my skill as a data analyst. Later on, I learned Tableau, Hadoop, AWS, and Docker on the job through colleagues.   


How did I become a data scientist from being a data analyst? I asked my colleagues who were data scientists. I asked them that I want to elevate and go up the ladder specifically. I told them if I can be a part of their projects and learn. I was recommended to the manager by a colleague when there was an opening. People will help you get there if you ask for it.   


Do I know R? No. I don't work with R. Most of my job consist of meetings, sharing jupyter files, figuring out how to clean the data. I have a template that I use for data cleaning and to see what data I have. You probably do this everyday at work as a data analyst when you are repeating the process. Just make an empty one and save it so you can copy/paste it.   


Did I take the technical interview/take home test or whatever? No. I told them that the projects I've worked takes me a month or so to complete. The technical test/take home assessment wouldn't highlight my skills as they are not relevant to the job description. So the interviewer likes that and instead we talked about my projects. I was bold in that approach. It's about thinking different and thinking outside the box. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not your typical programmer or scientist. I come from a scientific background and being self-employed gave me lot of perspective that are not programmer's or scientist's POV. So, I have something unique to offer in that insight. 

&amp;#x200B;

my portfolio consists of capstone projects such as kaggle titanic and those classic datasets. It's ok to have them on your portfolio. No shame in that. Most employers won't look down on that. They like my take on the titanic dataset. It's about how you dissect that dataset in a different way than everyone else.   


Get github website and share your articles and portfolios. Most of my projects nowadays come from /r/dataisbeatiful. I tried reverse engineer their data and see if I can come at same conclusion they did.   


It's better than Kaggle.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start at the beginning. I'm from Venezuela living in Medellin, Colombia. I've been working in an email marketing agency remotely for the last 2 years. I'm currently the Operations Manager at the 13 people company. I like the leadership part of my job and I like the people I work with. I don't like the rate so much. I make $8/hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, I want to move up the ladder but I only have a high school degree. I have experience with marketing though and all that I've learned have been through online courses. While trying to find the next best thing I could learn and at the same time comparing it to the things I like I figured data analysis looked like something I'd enjoy doing. I've always loved working with data, spreadsheets, and analysis ever since I started making money online (trough online poker at first) plus I know about the ""demand hype"" the internet says there is for such skills so it looks like a perfect fit.

&amp;#x200B;

I started with Codecademy and quickly went through the [data science path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science), which I stopped once I reached SciPy as it seemed too complicated for a total beginner like me and even unnecessary. I thought I needed to dig deeper into the basics of python and master SQL first. I also did the [Analyze Data with SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/analyze-data-with-sql) skill path there and a couple of SQL courses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand I've only scratched the surface here. I'm putting my focus on Udacity free data science courses next. Just currently installing Anaconda and Jupyter to start with the [Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170)[ intro course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been able to open up considerable free time for these courses and still do my job right with proper time management.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I'm in a good path or is there something else you could recommend that may take me there quickly?

My current focus would be salary-increase while working a job I enjoy. 

My experience has been mainly with email marketing and some with Facebook ads. Although I've done a couple of HubSpot courses, a tableau specialization, and an SEO specialization. I've enjoyed a lot working with SQL too, so far.

I'm completely open to suggestions! Thank you.",11,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

So i was wondering what the standard really is to consider yourself a data scientist. It seems that as long as you are doing something with data you are considered one already, but there is probably more to the book than that... So without a degree, when are you then considered a data scientist? what skills would you need etc?

&amp;#x200B;

Like i can do pandas,matplotlib, Tensorflow basics, but i wouldn't per se call myself a data scientist then already?

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?

But I might be stuck in my own head, so here goes. I am currently about 5 weeks in to a masters program in data science. As a background, I have an MBA in Business Analytics and worked in the oil and gas industry in a role that was essentially a combination of data analyst and systems analyst (it was a very small business). I knew when I took the job that it did not require an MBA but it was in the location I needed at the time. I mention it because while I have the Business Analytics degree, my work experience is more that of a junior data analyst. 

I quit my job several months ago, and while searching for a new one, I kept seeing ads to apply for an advanced degree in data science. My thought process was that I already have the business knowledge for making these types of decisions, now Ill have the technical skills to get the data as well.

The problem is this: **I dont know if I actually want to be a data scientist after all**. I like learning R and Python (because I like programming in general) but the statistics doesnt really interest me. I know Im only in my first two classes of school, but from everything Ive researched and read about, statistics is a major part of data science. I was partially aware of this going in, but I dont think it hit home until I was hit with a full blown stats class. 

**But do I actually drop out?** Im not worried about failing or anything. I can easily stay the course and obtain my degree and see what DS jobs await me afterwards. But I loved the things I did as a data analyst: I love SQL, and databases, and reports, and creating dashboards. But as has been said in more than 1 conversation on here, analysts generally dont earn the salaries that scientists do. Plus, DS is seen as the more elite field, which I think is always attractive, especially to Type-As like myself. However, I dont want to get another advanced degree just because I started it.

I had very little idea about how each sub-fields were related to each other, and how each of them was different. I used to clump them all together as ""machine learning"", and I was not really sure which specific sub-field I wanted to pursue. I still have doubts. My efforts were all scattered. I did Andrew Ng's ML course, then did a little Data science internship (which I had to cut short midway because of reasons, but which I will be resuming soon), and also started doing Computer Vision research project in the meantime, while trying to learn Deep Learning(I was bad, but it was a ""learn on the job"" kind of a deal). I realized CV was not for me (i was never really interested myself, I just wanted to get good with deep learning).  I realized academia was not really for me, I wanted to get into the industry.  


Now, I have to admit that maths has never been my strong suit (though I used to love Probability, still like it very much), but I was/am ready and willing to learn however much is needed for doing a proper job.  


What I loved during my data science internship is : analyzing the given data to understand how a problem statements can be tackled, to decide what are the most suitable features for tackling the problem (creating new features when needed), shape them, and to finally use them to come up with a solution to a problem. I loved the LOGICAL thinking aspect of it. I found that stimulating. To think about what aspects of the data I can use to solve a problem, and the logic behind choosing those specific data. I did not have this when I was trying to work on CV. Maybe CV is just not for me.  


But on the other hand, I am not good with calculus (of course I can handle the linear algebra), and I would prefer to   
spend time on the data and manipulating it, than focussing too much on the maths (I know I need to have a good grasp of stats, working on it). Spending all day on calculus and research papers (like I had to do in CV) will make me miserable. I would like to have an active life outside of my work too (travel and stuff), and I did not find that at all compatible with the CV researcher lifestyle. Dunno how compatible it will be for data analytics/DS.  


I know this is kind of a very unorganized collection of my thoughts. Yet, I would like to ask you, what advice would you have for me? I am confused, I would like some clarity.

Markdown is a tool to convert plain text to HTML. This enables us to  increase the visibility of the text matter without crowding it with all  sorts of HTML tags.

This feature becomes especially useful in creating tutorials or  project reports where we need to display our code and accompanying  visualizations in an easily understandable format.

So let's see how we can accomplish that in our tutorial given below.

So for example, if we have a spike on a page at a certain time and we see that a constituent logged on at that time, we could create a variable to show possible interest of the theme of that page.

I am obsessed with making Data Science in Python faster and many people told me that data cleaning and manipulation are the most tedious tasks in their daily work.

Which are the exact tasks where you spend/lose most of your time when performing data cleaning/manipulation in pandas?

1. reading in datasets (finding the right separator, dataformat, ...)
2. adjusting the data types of the columns - eg parse datetime, parse to numeric or categoric, others?
3. removing missing values
4. finding and removing duplicate values
5. parsing columns and removing invalid strings?
6. concatenating datasets
7. joining multiple tables
8. creating groupbys and aggregations
9. filtering and selecting subsets
10. creating new columns/feature engineering
11. visualizing the dataset and exploring it
12. **Something else? Did I miss something?**

I am planning to collect the best libraries for the tasks (or maybe write a library on my own to fill the missing gaps) in order to make the working process much faster.

I'm thinking of starting with problem definition and goal of the project. Then talk about the data I'm working with, where it comes from, what's good about it and what's not so good. Then how I built my setup (data cleaning, feature engineering, validation set, choice of metric ..). Showcase some basic baselines and end on the algorithms I tried.

&amp;#x200B;

The situation: I am trying to try and find a job as a data analyst currently. I applied for a position that I was wholly qualified for in every aspect, except that I don't know Google Tag Manager. So, now I am trying to practice with it. I have eBay listings I would like to practice with. Apparently, someone was able to track data on their eBay listings page via their Google Analytics account ([https://community.ebay.com/t5/Tools-Apps/How-to-Track-eBay-Listing-with-Google-Analytics-Beginers-Guide/td-p/27194223](https://community.ebay.com/t5/Tools-Apps/How-to-Track-eBay-Listing-with-Google-Analytics-Beginers-Guide/td-p/27194223)) but this method completely bypasses Google Tag Manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR for the link; eBay allows you to code your descriptions for your listings in HTML if you choose. However, in order for Google Tag Manager to work, you need to paste two snippets of code in your HTML code; one after the &lt;head&gt; tag and one after the &lt;body&gt; tag. The problem is, neither of these tags shows up in the skeleton of HTML code that is your listing description. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice/ thoughts? Or maybe another website I can practice using Google Tag Manager with? I was thinking of SoundCloud if eBay can't work.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

To say the least, It's been really fun. I now want to pursue a career in it.

For example, you have monthly and quarterly reporting time frames. 

How do you approach these problems? Please share!

 I always wonder how people approach prediction or forecasting for multivariate time series problems, because so often it's difficult to beat univariate classical models like ARIMA and state-space/SARIMAX models (which I tried but can't quite understand). 

From my observations in work and kaggle, it's common to create lag variables of varying time frames depending on your target. Then, throw xgboost or other powerful algorithm at it. 

For example if you were predicting weather, you might make 1mth, 3mth, 6,12mth lag variables \[e.g. mean, std, median\].   
 Then, you create growths or diffs on other time frames vs those lag variables like year-over-year or vs-prior-period. You can do it on the important time series features like: precipitation,  temperature, humidity, wind, perhaps grouped by time of day. 

What else works? 

I don't know if LSTM/RNN is the answer, but do think NN's will figure it out best in a ""dilated"" (skip connections) form, like this dilated CNN: [https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/)",16,31,False,self,,,,,

Some background: I graduated from a small public college in 2018 with a BA in Comp Sci and have since been working for a IT consultency group. After months of doing lackluster work like setting up meetings, writing application interface docs, emailing people for random stuff for my manager, etc (i feel like its intern work) , Ive basically done 0 coding or development work. Typically during office hours since I have nothing to do but refresh my emails, I started to self study and found myself on edX and looked at some Data Science courses. They all look really interesting and seem to be a great skillset for the market. 

i know some Python and it seems like a pretty fun language to learn and play aroubd with. Im thinking about quitting my job in a few months and purse my masters. I have not taken the GRE yet and the UCSD online masters doesnt require it.  The tuition cost is 15k which sounds pretty good and its fully online ( im in NY). 

Would this be a good advancement for me and my career?

I'm hoping to expand my knowledge in this area but unsure which units are relevant and hoping people can make suggestions to my study plan.

Below is a list of units I plan to enrol into:

|  Calculus and Matrix Algebra|Calculus and matrix algebra form the basis of the mathematical knowledge required to model physical, environmental, biological and engineering systems and investigate their behaviour. This unit assumes an understanding of the basic topics and develops them further. Vector and matrix operations, determinants, inverses and eigenvalues will be considered along with differentiation, integration, sequences and series, differential equations, and introductory multivariable calculus. Applications will be considered, with computer algebra packages used to reduce tedious calculations and present results. |
|:-|:-|
|  Statistical Data Analysis |Topics: summarising data with numbers and graphs, describing and comparing data distributions, probability and sampling distributions, sampling methods, statistical inference foundations (estimation and hypothesis testing), comparing measurements or proportions between groups, analysing relationships between variables, non-parametric methods. Throughout, students use statistical software, interpret its output, and report their conclusions. |
|  Mathematical Methods|Real problems often involve a number of variables that depend on time (a vector function), or a single function that depends on many variables (a function of several variables), or a combination of both. This unit is made up of four sections: Fourier series, multivariable calculus, linear algebra and Laplace transforms. These are branches of mathematics essential for dealing with such real-world problems.|
|  Probability and Statistical Inference|This unit examines relevant topics in probability and statistics theory, including distribution theory, mathematical expectation and variance, and likelihood inference. It derives common probability distributions and illustrates their uses, provides insight into the forms of expected values and variances for various distributions, and introduces likelihood inference, which provides a unified framework that underpins much of statistical inference. |
|  Applied Statistics |This unit considers select topics from experimental design and survey methods, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing and modelling for continuous and categorical variables. Throughout, advanced statistical software will play an important role in data visualisation and analysis. Students will consider topics through the presentation of real research problems from a number of disciplines, gaining valuable experience in the application of statistics in a variety of contexts, including a project simulating statistical problems commonly encountered in the workplace. |
|  Time Series Analysis|This unit introduces methods for the analysis of measurements made sequentially over time and a brief look at data which are multivariate and correlated. Time series models are developed and inferential procedures (estimation, testing, forecasting) discussed. The unit also includes frequency domain methods for the extraction of signals from noisy data and discussion of linear systems. Applications of time series analysis are shown on Perth temperature data illustrating concepts useful for forecasting and demonstrating aspects of climate change.|
|  Statistical Design and Data Analysis|This unit is designed for applied statisticians and scientists who need to apply the principles of statistical science to collect, analyse, interpret and present data of high quality. The rich class of statistical techniques known as regression models, which includes multiple regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and logistic regression are covered. Case studies and student projects explore the use of these techniques on real data from a variety of disciplines using statistical computing packages. |

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated, and if you want the stack points feel free to answer there. On to the post:

This may be a dumb question but I can't figure out how to actually get the values imputed using StatsModels MICE back into my data. I have a dataframe (`dfLocal`) with hourly temperature records for five neighboring stations (`LOC1:LOC5`) over many years and I'd like to impute the missing data for any given site. Following the examples I have:

    imp = mice.MICEData(dfLocal)
    fml = 'LOC1 ~ LOC2 + LOC3 + LOC4 + LOC5'
    mice = mice.MICE(fml, sm.OLS, imp)
    results = mice.fit(10, 10)
    print(results.summary())

    dfLocal.dropna(axis=0, how='all', inplace=True)
    imp.data = imp.data.set_index(dfLocal.index)

    # In this case I only want to fill one specific set of missing data
    # hence gap_start and gap_end
    dfLocal.loc[gapStart:gapEnd, 'LOC1'] = imp.data[fillSite]

My understanding of MICE is broadly that missing values are imputed multiple times and then combined to find the best value from the many. The only way I've found to actually get any numbers out of the above code is with imp.data but I'm afraid that might just be one of the individual imputations before they're combined? All I can seem to get from fitting the model (`results`), though, is the summary?

I'm far from a statistician (and not much of a programmer either) so I've been reading through the code for mice.MICE and other resources on general MICE applications, but I'd appreciate any guidance on this as I can't find much about using statsmodels' MICE online. Normally I'd post some data on Gist but the full set is a bit large. That said, I'll upload it if ya'll think it would help.
