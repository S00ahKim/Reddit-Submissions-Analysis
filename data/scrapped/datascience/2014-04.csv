I know basic python programming and thus want to stay on the python datasci path.

Problem is, there are many R packages that appeal to me as a social science person. 

Can Rpy2 allow full use of arbitrary r packages, or is there a catch. How well does it work in practice?

If Rpy2 is too limited, I'd unfortunately have to branch over to r, but I would rather not, because of the extra overhead.

Thanks

I have experience running regressions, manipulating and cleaning data sets, and producing graphs and such in R, and was wondering how best to prepare for this type of an interview.

I'm a little out of my element in having to produce something without at least running the steps I'll be taking past someone else, so I'm going to spend the next few days practicing. I'm also a little nervous because I've never had to produce something under a strict timed deadline, and I'm not sure what sort of questions I should prepare for, particularly since this is an internship -- the internship posting made it seem like they only wanted an extremely basic idea of statistics packages and a strong technical/math foundation, but from reading glassdoor etc., it seems like they are sending me the same test that they give everyone, even people who have been in the field for many years?


So a. What can I do to prepare in the next few days -- any common pitfalls you can think of? Is there some sort of a website with a general overview of the types of questions that interviewers tend to ask, so I can make sure that I don't have any gaping holes in my knowledge?

I've been involved with the business since they opened six years ago (not data oriented).

They collect detailed data from every sale (POS systems). I have access to all of the data (which has not been used for anything yet). I can perform whatever type of analysis I like and have something for my resume for post graduation job hunting.

- How would you use this scenario to your advantage, given that you know (roughly) what employers look for, and have an idea of what makes a more attractive candidate? What tasks would you take on? 

- How can I position the experience to give it legitimacy? Saying I was a ""data analyst"" for a small chain of restaurants seems like a stretch.

I wanted to find something more computationally heavy, but I didn't want to do a CS Machine Learning degree.  So I have settled on two, and cost isn't really a factor.

I'm an engineer working in the oil and gas industry and I see a ton of data science applications.  I'm really looking to develop a strong background in data analysis in which I can take large sets of data and determine relationships that may or may not be obvious.  I'm wanting to develop techniques to possible predict future events by looking at historical data.  I'm also wanted to get better at data visualization.

I know this is an impossible question given my 3 sentence background, I guess I'm just looking for feedback on the two programs.



Program 1: Berekely Data Science
http://datascience.berkeley.edu/academics/curriculum/

Brand new program do it is pretty tough to evaluate, but I like what I read in the course descriptions.  I also give Berkeley some benefit of the doubt given their engineering reputation.



Program 2: Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Tech
This one isn't a pure data science program, but it is flexible enough that I could cover my bases pretty well.

Any and all feedback would be appreciated.

A large part of the class is doing some kind of statistical analysis on a dataset of our choosing. Pursuing a hypothesis testing, inference, or regression problem is preferred.

I would love to do my project using some real data and solving a real problem that people have. Anyone have an small to medium sisze analysis project that they would like to hand-off to me? Possible projects include

* customer lifetime or lifetime value analysis
* load/demand prediction
* anything you can think of!

Any data scientists have any projects they would like to hand off to a student? :) Feel free to PM me with any questions about my background or respond in the thread about any possible projects or advice. Thanks!",4,5,False,self,,,,,

If not, please direct me to the relevant subreddit.

I'm looking for resources to help me understand the process that starts with getting lots (hundreds) of very large (6GB+) JSON files from an API call, and ends with all of the relevant data in a manageable database (e.g. MySQL). 

I have some experience with JSON formatted API replies using python and R, but with relatively small scale data that didn't require anything special to manage. In fact, I often just exported it in CSV format. This means I do not have any experience working with databases typically used in situations like this, either inside the database management software or through python.

Obviously the large JSON files that I'm looking to work with require special considerations, but I am ignorant on exactly what those might be. I've done some research on the topic, but I'm having a very hard time finding a good starting place. So the things I'm looking for are as follows:

-general advice
-beginner resources
-sample python scripts
-APIs (with large scale data replies) in the JSON format, for practice

Any help at all will be very much appreciated.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

As a new college graduate with a computer science and economics degree, I was wondering if our seasoned veterans can offer us some insight.

* What's a typical day at work like?

* What languages do you typically use?

* What tools do you use?

* How in-depth is the statistics that is used?

* How's the monetary compensation?

* What advice can you offer for those interested in getting into data science?
