I'm toying with the idea for a few of reasons:


1. The ""data science"" at my company devolved into more analytics than anything else. I've had to continue take courses outside of work to keep the actual data science skills fresh (stats, machine learning, deep learning) but barely get to apply them and it's a real bummer. At this point, I'm sure it'll be pretty hard to get into a ""real"" data science job if I try to transition. Though it seems that data science roles are becoming more product/marketing analytics which isn't too exciting, and I don't think I'm smart enough for the hardcore phd-level research scientist roles


2. I've had a lot of exposure to the data engineering side. ETLs, AWS infra, version control, various APIs, unit testing, pushing things to production, etc. and I find the process of building something from scratch and collaborating with the data engineers really fun


3. I want to be more on the back end and middle of the data spectrum. Pure modeling and analytics is the front-end, and I feel that only very mature companies have the infrastructure set up correctly for data science to be able to unlock its true potential. More job opportunities in the back end/middle for startup and growth stage companies, which i've been liking so far


4. As far as skill combinations go, software engineer + data guy seems like a pretty deadly combo for future success


What's the best process to go about this? I'd consider myself decent at leetcode-easy problems and have a very basic understanding of cs fundamentals. Not sure if I should focus on leetcode, or building a complete application to showcase, or pick up another language (I'm 99% python, 1% Scala and JavaScript), or just edit my resume to highlight the engineering side of things and pray n' spray?

# Chapter 2: Why Clean Data?

(Excerpt from[ Ultimate Guide To Cleaning Data with Excel and Google Sheets](https://landing.inzata.com/Ultimate-Guide-to-Cleaning-Data-website-cta))

Data cleansing is the process of spotting and correcting inaccurate data. Organizations rely on data for many things, but few actively address data quality. Whether its the integrity of customer addresses or ensuring invoice accuracy. Ensuring effective and reliable use of data can increase the intrinsic value of the brand. Business enterprises must assign importance to data quality.

A data driven marketing survey conducted by Tetra data found that 40% of marketers do not use data to its full effect. Managing and ensuring that the data is clean can provide significant business value.

Improving data quality can eliminate problems like expensive processing errors, manual troubleshooting, and incorrect invoices. Data quality is also a way of life because important data like customer information is always changing and evolving.

Business enterprises can achieve a wide range of benefits by cleansing data and managing quality which can lead to lowering operational costs and maximizing profits.

Who are the heroes who allow the organization to seize and enjoy all these benefits? affectionately refer to these poor souls as **PWCDs**, or **People Who Clean Data**.  These brave people, and hopefully you are reading this because you hope to be one of them, are the noblest. They often get little recognition even though they clean up the messes of hundreds, if not thousands of other people every day. They are the noble janitors of the data world. And I salute them.

# Top 5 Benefits of Data Cleaning

## Improve the Efficiency of Customer Acquisition Activities

Business enterprises can significantly boost their customer acquisition and retention efforts by cleansing their data regularly. With the high throughput of the prospecting and lead process, filtering, cleansing, enriching having accurate data is essential to its effectiveness. Throughout the marketing process, enterprises must ensure that the data is clean, up-to-date and accurate by regularly following data quality routines.

Clean data can also ensure the highest returns on email or postal campaigns as chances of encountering outdated addresses or missed deliveries are very low. Multi-channel customer data can also be managed seamlessly which provides the enterprise with an opportunity to carry out successful marketing campaigns in the future as they would be aware of the methods to effectively reach out to their target audience.

## Improve Decision Making Processes

The cornerstone of effective decision making in a business enterprise is data. According to Sirius Decisions, data in an average B2B organization doubles every 12-18 months and though the data might be clean initially, errors can creep in at any time. In fact, in nearly all businesses where data quality is not managed, data quality decay is constantly at work. Each time new records are added; duplicates may be created. Things happening outside your organization, like customers moving and changing emails and telephone numbers will, over time, degrade data quality.

Yet the majority of enterprises fail to prioritize data quality management, or even acknowledge they have a problem! In fact, many of them dont even have a record of the last time quality control was performed on their customers data. More often than not they merely discard or ignore data they believe to be of poor quality, and make decisions through other means. Here you can see that data quality is a massive barrier toward digital transformation and business intelligence, much less every companys desire to become more Data Driven.

Accurate information and quality data are essential to decision making. Clean data can support better analytics as well as all-round business intelligence which can facilitate better decision making and execution. In the end, having accurate data can help business enterprises make better decisions which will contribute to the success of the business in the long run.

## Streamline Business Practices

Eradicating duplicate and erroneous data can help business enterprises to streamline business practices and avoid wasteful spending. Data cleansing can also help in determining if particular job descriptions within the enterprise can be changed or if those positions can be integrated somewhere else. If reliable and accurate sales information is available, the performance of a product or a service in the market can be easily assessed.

Data cleansing along with the right analytics can also help the enterprise to identify an opportunity to launch new products or services into the market at the right time. It can highlight various marketing avenues that the enterprises can try. In practically any other business process you can name, decisions are made every day, some large, but many small.

It is this systematic pushing of high-quality information down the chain of command, into the hands of individual contributors that helps them improve decisions made at all levels of the organization. Called Operational Intelligence, it is used more commonly for quick lookups and to inform the thousands of decisions that are made every day inside the organization.

## Increase Productivity

Having a clean and properly maintained enterprise dataset can help organizations ensure that the employees are making the best use of their time and resources. It can also prevent the staff of the enterprise from contacting customers with out-of-date information or create invalid vendor files in the system by conveniently helping them to work with clean records thereby maximizing the staffs efficiency and productivity. High quality data helps reduce the risk of fraud, ensuring the staff has access to accurate vendor or customer data when payments or refunds are initiated.

## Increase Revenue

Business enterprises that work on improving the consistency and increasing the accuracy of their data can drastically improve their response rates which results in increased revenue. Clean data can help business enterprises to significantly reduce the number of returned mails. If there are any time sensitive information or promotions that the enterprise wants to convey to their customers directly, accurate information can help in reaching the customers conveniently and quickly.

Duplicate data is another aspect which can be effectively eradicated by data cleansing. According to Sirius Decisions, the financial impact of duplicate data is directly proportional to the time that it remains in the database.

Duplicate data can significantly drain the enterprises resources as they will have to spend twice as much on a single customer. For example, if multiple mails are sent to the same customer, they might get annoyed and might completely lose interest in the enterprises products and services.

""We're a company focused on innovation and teamwork"".

""We are a team that is committed to going above and beyond""

Companies, teams and people will self-assign core values and philosophies as easily as they put on clothes, and there is a general feeling that if you say it enough times, that becomes your culture.

But it isn't, and the very definition of company culture - the real definition - is the same reason why company culture rarely changes.

**The real company culture is the set of behaviors that get people hired and promoted\***

It's that simple. If you declare yourself an ""innovative culture"", but you promote the people who are most willing to defend the old way of doing things... you're not. If you declare yourself of being a high performing culture, but the people that work themselves to death get passed for promotions by the people who play politics, then you're just a political culture. If you declare yourself to be a company that believes in family values, but has VPs that demand their employees to work nights and weekends to meet deadlines... you get the point.

Most importantly, because the people that exhibit these behaviors get hired and promoted faster than the people who don't, your organization will always put its future in the hands of the people who live that culture - the real culture. And that means that it will be *incredibly* rare for someone to be in a position of authority that is willing - let alone able - to challenge that culture. And that is because, by definition, what got them there *is* the culture.

*Why are you posting this?*

Because my current role is one of the few I've had where I have felt happy with the culture, and what it made me realize is that at several of my previous stops I subconsciously was waiting for the culture to change. In some cases, it was their viewpoints on work-life balance. At other stops, it was their commitment to data literacy. 

And those things never changed, and even after I have left and looked back several years later, they haven't changed. And this includes organizations that have had changes at the C-Suite level - several of them. 

**If you are not happy with your company's culture today, you need to start looking for a new job yesterday, because you are on a ride that will make you more and more frustrated each day until you explode.**

And you don't need to do that to yourself. There are too many jobs out there, too many companies to subject yourself to a company culture that doesn't jive with you. More importantly, there are 100% companies out there with healthy cultures that can foster a good career for data scientists, regardless of what your personal preferences as far as work-life balance and everything else might be.

*Ok* u/dfphd*, you mentioned something in the title something about changing company culture. How do you do that?*

Note - this only works in a subset of cases: 

1. Live the values the company wants you to live when everyone outside your team is watching (i.e., get all your work done the way the company wants it done when people are looking)
2. In private, conduct yourself (and your team if you have one) according to the values that you think the company should value *and deliver outstanding results while doing so.* 

You have a company that doesn't value innovation, but rather producing the same 1000 reports every day? Well, keep producing the same 1000 reports every day, but then in ninja mode, come up with an alternate solution that does away with the 1000 reports. And then implement it, and make everything better, and have a bunch of people give it glowing support. 

And then do it again and again and again and again until you start infecting people around you and they want to get some of that same positive feedback you're getting.

Caveats:

1. It works a hell of a lot better if you're an executive. Or at least like an upper-middle manager (e.g., Director).
2. It is *exhausting* both for you and anyone who you may manage.
3. If you ever slip up on your primary work, you will get crucified for spending any level of effort on this other stuff, so you need to be flawless.
4. Even if you do everything right, it may not work.

I want to take what i learn from this program and become a data scientist. Is that a job you look for with no experience (other than what i get from the program) or is this something you work up to being from say a data analyst?  


I understand that data analytics is something used virtually everywhere, I would prefer not to just help business's make more money. My goal is to see if I can help the world out a little bit with my training and education. I have seen that the CDC has a lot of open positions for Data Analysts.

I am working with the hardworking and important people government in my country in Southeast Asia.

So, in my city we used to have a with a lot of crime. Terrorism.

So to prevent it, we installed these 'checkposts' on several roads. They were like blocks to make cars go through, slowly, so the police could examine them closely and stop anyone if they seemed suspicious.

The checkposts looked like this: [https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/digital\_news/2011-12-20/police-night-check-posts-in-islamabad-9739.jpg](https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/digital_news/2011-12-20/police-night-check-posts-in-islamabad-9739.jpg)

We also did major cleanup operations against terror organizations and gangs and terrorism dropped so much. There's barely any terrorism here anymore.

So, we don't feel the need for extensive checkposts anymore.

And the we are getting rid of the checkposts and we want to replace it with technology.

So if any of you have any good ideas as to how that could be done, then that would be much appreciated.

If you could engineer a solution, own an AI company or know someone who knows an AI company or know anyone that could help, we'd love to work with you.

Remember: We need a replacement for checkposts so keep that in mind. The checkposts had a few policemen. They were there at night as well. So we need, through technology, pairs of eyes that can look at night. We also need some way to distinguish between suspicious cars. So it should have a way to check for explosives. Perhaps, radiation?

I was thinking a whole network of cameras equipped with Artifiical Intelligence and Machine Learning, that can also monitor all the spectra of light coming out of cars, to see what was in the car and check for explosives, and all the cameras across the region communicate with each other and log in every face through facial recognition and every car and number plate they see.

But, I'm still unsure about my idea.

I'm a CS student at university still, and I had some questions about building a non-intensive broad Data Science/Analytics curriculum for a club I'm in.

The club is a business consulting group and we're trying to offer Data Analytics to our clients, but the catch is, no one in the club knows what it is lol.

I was creating a 10 week curriculum for everyone in the club that's interested to teach people about Data Analytics and how to use it to help our clients.

I was trying to build it in the focus of Business Intelligence, since that's the main way we'd be working with data and helping our clients gain better insights.

So far this is what I've got, but I'm not sure how to continue from here with more advanced topics (I'm a noob myself lol). 


---

**GOAL: Teach people how to analyze data and help companies gain insights from the data we collect**

**Week 0 What is Data Analytics? (short 30 min talk just gauging peoples interest)**

* Value of data to companies, talk about good/bad data collection policies
* Who is Data Analytics for, why bother, etc
* Get people to actually sign up and see when they want to have classes (after main meeting, on weekends, etc)
* Send out dev environment setup to people interested (simple script to install python and libraries if you have time, maybe create github to hold lesson plans and have people pull from there)

**Week 1 Introduction to Data Analytics and python**
 
* First real workshop, have everyone get familiar with Google analytics and Python (with jupyter notebook!)
* Talk about tools such as Google Analytics, Tableau, Looker
* Insights and examples from certain cases
* Real world cases where DA has helped businesses grow and find weakpoints
* Explain rest of course curriculum and timeline, have everyone build their own DA projects with provided datasets (homework!! (keep it light though))
* Provide external resources outside the class

**Week 2 Data is messy**

* After everyone gets familiar with python, teach them how to use numpy and pandas to clean and wrangle data
* Try to keep it interesting, dont bore people with just like okay this is how you use a numpy array
* Maybe run a crash course through important stuff to know with linear algebra and python (matricies, etc)
* Give people homework to clean up a provided dataset for next workshop

**Week 3 What does it all mean?**

* Hopefully everyone did their HW, if not provide finished hw to work with
* Show how bundles of meaningless data can actually be transformed into insights related to business decisions
* Show how to create meaningful reports with the data provided with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook
* Incorporate usage of these skills with customers

---


NOTE: The people I'd be teaching would have no real programming experience, most of them are business majors with not much python experience.

I was planning on doing an hour/hour and a half workshop a week to teach people, along with providing some notebooks for HW each week.

Not really sure how I should continue with this, any help would be appreciated.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

I am working with a data set that incorporates financial information overtime. Here is an example of a similar, simplified data set:



Year | # Guests | Money Spent (total) | Money Spent (avg per guest)
---|---|---|----
1960| 10| $100 | $10

Background:

I have been a data scientist for about 2 years now. I have a bachelors degree in Economics. I started out doing risk modeling for an insurance company. About 5 months ago, I was hired by a small consulting company. My role here is more of a machine learning engineer. I create machine learning systems to automate business processes. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and R.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Job Issues:

Machine learning is a hard field to do consulting work in. Most companies that have adequate data infrastructure already have a data science team. Those that don't have the appropriate infrastructure can't benefit from machine learning. As a result, I am getting little experience in my current role. So, I'm looking for a change. For every project I have, there are \~4 weeks of no work. Doing this time, I get certs and do research. Right now, I only have UIPath certification.

&amp;#x200B;

General concerns about the field of Data Science:

I live in a medium sized city on the east coast --  not a ton of data science jobs. Additionally, I don't enjoy the modeling aspects of the job nearly as much as the engineering. I understand most commonly used models, when to use them, their pitfalls, etc; however, my interest with them is very applied. I don't have any desire to develop new machine learning algorithms -- only using pre-existing tools to add business value.

I would like to use machine learning as one of many tools to automate business processes.

&amp;#x200B;

Future Steps:

I'm thinking about leaving Machine Learning specific roles in favor of a Software developer role, but I don't know if I could close to my current pay $75k. I can take a slight pay cut, but not too significant.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

Could I get a decent job as a Python Software Developer with my current experience?

Should I just try to get a machine learning engineer at a different company?

Any other input?

I'm currently building an app for Field data collection for almost a year and I just recently launched publicly.

My goal is to allow anybody to collect all sorts of data points easily from the field and visualize them in a Map or as a List.

Currently it's still a tiny tool but it does one thing and aims to  do it very well.

Is the value proposition clear enough? What would you add/change/improve?

TLDR; I spent a couple hours everyday for 2 years learning and doing analysis for fun, and found opportunities for data science in every aspect of my job until I had enough experience for someone to take a chance on me and hire me

My starting point:

Degree- BBA from a top 50 school in Information Systems and Data Analytics

Relevant Coursework- Intro to Statistics, Database Design, Intro to SQL, Applied Business Intelligence Tools (Alteryx, Qlik, Tableau), Intro to Data Visualization, Intro to Machine Learning in SAS, Web Application Development (Javascript/HTML), Intro to Mobile App Development (Swift)

With these skills I was able to land a job as an analyst at a global consulting firm (i.e. Accenture/CapGemini, EY)

**Below is a roadmap of my first 2 years at my first job**:

First project on the job:
- Gathering requirements for a BI application
- Here I spent 4 hours everyday 7 days a week taking courses on Data Camp and reading books like Python for Dummies. I it took about 8 months to replace all of my excel work with Python and really learn enough to be useful on a team of business folks. 

With the skills from my first role I got a new project doing data cleansing, data munging, quality checks etc. using my existing SQL skills and new skills in Python. I was asked to do all this work in excel, but forced myself to do everything in Python both to learn and prove myself worthy of harder tasks.

I took opportunities to do simple statistical testing in Python and when I saw opportunities to bolster my team's analysis by looking at things such as feature importance from a tree based model or setting up data correctly for a simple linear regression, **I forced that work into our project by doing it on my own time and presenting it to my team**.  

Slowly I became my team's go to general analytics and Python automation person. I used this internal reputation to get a new project on a team looking to implement some basic ML models at a client and needed someone who knew sklearn and could guide client analysts in doing things like walk-forward validation for time series models, and pointing out issues such as data leakage. 

On my own time I started to read books like ""Forecasting, Principles and Practice"" by Rob Hydnman and find dummy datasets on Kaggle to test concepts on. I took things a step further by creating dashboards of analysis I did for fun and putting together a small Tableau/Github portfolio, and adding a Personal Projects section to my resume. The portfolio work I kept private and would link it either in cold emails to hiring managers, or keep it handy in case I discussed a pet project during an interview. 

**Finding a new job**

Job titles I was searching for- Data Analyst, Associate Data Scientist

Number of cold applications over 3 months- ~60

Number of first round phone interviews- 7

Number of final rounds- 3

Job offers- 2

Almost every interview process followed this format:
- Phone screen with recruiter to discuss background
- Take home technical exam, either SQL or Python, just general analysis
- Phone call with hiring manager
- On site technical + meeting with hiring manager and team 

My pitch was that I was able to tie business problems to data science solutions, and could not only execute on problems as a data scientist using my technical skills but also present the results to the business and executives. I think this combination of soft and hard skills was the reason anyone even bothered to talk to me given my background.

I think what got me the final offers was how I presented myself as willing to learn, giving evidence in the form of my pet projects, all of the books I've read and courses I took in my free time. After I received the offer, the head of the R&amp;D group (a math PHD) said he liked my hustle and thought he could just teach me what I didn't know or point me to the right learning resources. 

For those of you looking to break in, I definitely think even if you're not someone with the perfect background, with enough time and study you can do it. 

My next step as I move into this role will be applying to masters programs to shore up all of my quantitative deficiencies. There's only so much you can learn on the job IMO unless you're really good at teaching yourself mathematical concepts. Unfortunately I learn much better in a class setting with homework assignments and structured learning!

Hey all,

I'm a 4th year honors Computer Science major at a Canadian university. Hopefully on track to graduate on time, but due to a nasty motorcycle accident in October my current semester has gotten pretty buggered up and may not be able to pass all my courses this semester, which is leaving me incredibly depressed.

After my undergrad I have always planned to pursue a career in data science. I'm quite proficient in R and it's machine learning libraries, moderately well versed in Tensorflow, proficient in Python, currently writing my honors thesis on 3d model reconstruction and 3d texture segmentation using ML (mainly Open3D).

It is what I am passionate about and I have a decent functional background in the field already through university courses specific to Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence and projects on my own through hackathons, Kaggle competitions, etc, although I will be the first to admit that I have much to learn.

The ""Professional Certificate in Data Science"" I see waved around is so incredibly tempting to me, however. I have a very strong applied (vs computation theory) CS and statistics background, and the idea of taking that knowledge and hammering out one of these say, Harvard offered programs, and then using that to launch into a career instead of taking another semester to grind out miscellaneous electives and some abstract theoretical courses is oh so tempting. But is there even any value to these courses?

The project is delivered as part of CSIROs Data61.

We are happy to announce the 0.8.1 release of the library, which extends StellarGraph capability by adding new algorithms and demos, enhancing interpretability via saliency maps for Graph Attention (GAT), and further simplifying graph machine learning workflows through standardised model APIs and arguments. 

This release, weve dealt with some bugs from the previous release and  introduced new features and enhancements. Some of these include:

* New directed GraphSAGE algorithm (a generalisation of GraphSAGE to directed graphs)
* New Attri2vec algorithm  
* New PPNP and APPNP algorithms 
* New Graph Attention (GAT) saliency maps for interpreting node classification with Graph Attention Networks
* Added directed SampledBFS walks on directed graphs
* Unified API of GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and HinSAGE classes by adding build() method to GCN and GAT classes
* Enhanced unsupervised GraphSage speed up via multithreading
* Support of sparse generators in the GCN saliency map implementation.
* Unified activations and regularisation for GraphSAGE, HinSAGE, GCN and GAT
* Changed from using keras to tensorflow.keras

Weve also added [new demos](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/master/demos/) using real-world datasets to show how StellarGraph can solve these tasks.

Access the StellarGraph project and explore the new features on [GitHub](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph). StellarGraph is a Python 3 library.

We welcome your feedback and contributions.

With thanks, the StellarGraph team.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

For context I have a masters degree in Neuroscience, about halfway through my course I was introduced to bioinformatics and data science and havent looked back. Competed a thesis on classifying Alzheimers from blood proteins and lipids in blood samples and learned R and Python. Fast forward 12 months, working for a SaaS company in digital health, have learned SQL, power BI and Tableau. Also learned HTML, CSS and the concepts of HTTPS. Most of this comes from self teaching myself some computer science and machine learning concepts. and being curious about how data is stored, transferred, accessed etc.  The devs in my company are very open and regularly let me look at work they are doing and talk me through parts of it. I even built a very small reporting website that cycles through the power BI iFrames of different reports in Angular with the help of some team members and really enjoyed it!

We are currently running a large ML project, that Im loving ,but I have found it very difficult to focus on what I should be learning next. I have really come to enjoy some concepts of web development and see potential to create and deploy web applications with ML models in frameworks like Django, but feel like I might be stretching myself very thin by dipping my toe into lots of different areas when I should just focus on developing my core data science skills? 

Sorry for the long rant, just looking for advice from any others in the community that have been on that line between data science and web development and whether its a viable career choice?",4,1,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to get feedback on this before I put it somewhere with my name on it. :) What are your thoughts? 

I am a data scientist at a bigger internet company. I work full-time and get good money. At night, when my wife and kids are in bed, I get my laptop and work as a data science consultant on Upwork. I love what I do, and since my day job pays all my bills, I could do it for free. In this article, I explain why I do it and why I would recommend you to do the same.  

## Why am I working for free? And why onUpwork?  

I always wanted to do my own thing, to be my own man. On the other hand, I have a well-settled life and when becoming a freelancer or entrepreneur, there is a risk that I don't want to take lightly. Instead of giving up all the security, I agreed with my employer to moonlight as a data science consultant.  

Cracking the ""find well-paying customers"" is not easy. The options that I knew, that would give me reasonable success were expensive. And especially, since I don't want to do it full time. I don't want to spend hundreds of Euros on Google Adwords to get a customer, that I don't want to charge. On websites like Upwork, you pay shares of what you earn. If you plan on not earning money, this seems to be a good deal.  

In the beginning, my main motivation was to get experience and reputation. Ideally, on the side and from home. The problems that we are facing in my day job are different from the ones that normal people have. And I wanted to know what these were. I was looking for small tasks that are generating a lot of value for the customers.  

What I learnt is that you meet amazing people on Upwork. It's the place where people come, that want to build a product in their most early stage. If you don't have money and you want an MVP, you will be trying to outsource it to the cheapest hire on the internet.  

## The German young graduates whose startup skyrocketed  

One of the **founders of a food delivery startup** reached out to me when their product was nothing but a Shopify website. They were planning on optimising their food buying process and posed me the problem: Given the data that we have, how many dishes we would sell in three days? I did the most simple ""model"" you could think of: a one-dimensional curve-fit. And it reduced their food waste by 20%. At least, that's what they told me at the time. By now, they are worth multiple millions.  

## The mysterious traffic pattern on a Myanmarese flight comparison website  

The **CEO of a Myanmarese flight comparison website** contacted me and asked for an analysis of website traffic data. It was different from my usual tasks because instead of a dataset, I got access to his Google Analytics account. I was asked to explain a sudden jump in traffic that did all seem to come from a single device type. Then, I forwarded him to an expert in website crawling.  

## The guy who uses Instagram ads to price your product before you haveit  

Imagine you want to know the value of your product, but you don't have it yet. The way to go about this is to test it. You offer some early version of it or a promise of future access to your product. Then, you show your offer to different people at different prices. I met an **English entrepreneur**, who offered these kinds of analyses in a product. And he asked me to help him to set up a process for testing for significant differences.

## The airport KPIanalysis  

This doesn't quite fall into the category ""awesome people with an awesome product"", but it was one of the most confusing experiences. There was this person who asked me to run an analysis on KPIs of an airport. I don't know who he was, why he had the data, or even why he paid me for it. But it was fun!


## Go meet people!

I have met extremely interesting people on Upwork, from different nationalities and different fields, but always passionate about their product. And I have seen that with just a couple of hours of work per job, I can create amazing value for many customers. In return, I got invaluable experiences.  

I would highly recommend anyone looking for work in the data science field to start here. There are so many people ranting about Upwork because of the international competition and price pressure. But if you are looking to grow your data science skills, or you are curious to get connected with startups and their founders, then I would highly recommend to check out these kinds of freelance websites.",12,1,False,self,,,,,

My question is: how crowded is the data science market? Are there millions of data scientists just swimming around competing for a few niche jobs? Furthermore, how lucrative is a career in data science? Process engineers do well, but do data scientists do better?

I only did a few applications and most of them were to companies 2+ hours away. At the time I was planning to move regardless and the Utrecht/Amsterdam Area intrigued me. Here's my list, I hope this helps others. I included salary negotiation stuff, but bear in mind the payouts are meager compared to the US. All monetary amounts are in gross euros per month. I'm also keen to hear feedback.

I posted this before on r/cscareerquestionsEU.

Me: 4 internships (2.5ish years) + 1 year of experience as a software engineer/scientific programmer. BSc and MSc in CS.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Company 1: Small Data Science consulting firm.**  
I was referred by a friend. The interview was about 1 hour, with a consultant and an engineer. I got along great with the consultant, but not so much with the engineer who seemed hostile and did not read my resume - he started asking me questions about my current manager while I made it very clear I was currently finishing up my thesis (and didn't actually have one). They were growing out of their office, and simply couldn't afford anyone who could not directly be put on contracting. I did not get an offer. Questions they asked:
   * Why did you change majors?
   * What kind of projects have you done?
   * Would you be willing to move into a data engineering role? (I said preferably not - shame on me)
   * What kind of management style do you prefer?
* **Company 2: Big Insurance / Bank**.   
I connected well to both the recruiter and their main engineer. The PhD engineer was working from several hours away and was doing a lot of data engineering and devopsy engineering stuff and he basically needed a partner because he was the only engineer for their data science team. This was somewhat of a misrepresentation from the advert. Regardless it went well and they asked me for a salary indication- I asked for 3000/m. They felt this was too much and they were also not able to cover my train expenses (300-400 / month) to get to the office. The very nice recruiter mentioned they would have to offer it to the engineer too, who was travelling each day by his own means. I wasn't ready to drop my expectations for transport / salary so the decision to not move on was mutual.
   * What kind of side projects have you done and are you working on (I showed them a side project for 5 mins)
* **Company 3: Big Data Science Consulting firm.**  
They immediately made it clear I could work for them but the offer was rather low (2650) however they have a very good lease deal and if I didn't like a car they also offered it as a flat pay-out, which would bump up that number to 3300 /month gross. I would be part of their data science team and could work for clients all over Europe so by far this would be the most interesting to start off my career. However, outside the car they had no scheme for public transport so I'd have to pay that out of my own pocket. I eventually received a second offer from them which was slightly higher, which I took.
   * What kind of models have you worked on in school?
   * What kind of work have you done for your last internship?
   * What are your expectations of consulting?
* **Company 4: Small Data Science consulting firm (direct competitor to #1).**  
This remains the weirdest interview I have ever had. I was referred by two friends who independently also provided feedback and what my salary expectations should be (these kind of friends are nice). It turned out this company was actually two different companies, with a smaller one offering traineeships and a bigger one offering consulting services. The interviewer (also CEO of the traineeship) was blunt and hostile, and mentioned several times ""You should know this"", ""You listed your master on your profile and we've had others from the same university come by who knew it fine"",""I am only going to evaluate you for our traineeship because you don't have the skills to work as a consultant"", and ended with ""You don't have enough motivation to come and work here"". There were no coding or implementation-based questions. The interviewer was a guy coming from economics (I recall?) and had gained his DS knowledge from online course material. I left the building with a bit of a depressed feeling but also wondering wtf just happened. Questions:
   * Why does Logistic Regression work well on NLP problems? (I explained, and then he said XGBoost was better and to use that instead - lol?)
   * How does backprop work?
   * How do SVMs work (once I started explaining I was interrupted and they said the question was too easy)
   * How do ANNs work
   * How do CNNs work
   * How does gradient boosting work
   * How come you never finished your first bachelor?
   * Do you regret switching majors?
   * How many credits did you get in your first ever year at university (Honestly I couldn't recall, I gave them an estimate and said I didn't think this was relevant to the position)
* **Company 5: Large online retailer**  
I was referred by a friend and had a phone interview. That went fine and they gave me a salary indication afterwards: 3500/m. I then had to do a couple of IQ-style tests which took a couple of hours. Additionally, I had to work with a data set they provided and build a PoC or demonstrate my findings. I spent about 12 hours on this data science take-home test and really liked it. I went wild with lambda's.Finally I was invited to go on to their main office for four rounds of interviews. **I was so excited that I didn't manage to sleep that night** so you can imagine how that went.. for the first 2 rounds I passed my HR and engineering interview, but the last interview with two managers went worse. I still think I was pretty close to being let in and for about a week or so deliberated asking for another chance. 
* **Company 6: Big Consulting Firm (competitor of #3).**  
I was referred by a friend who invited me over for coffee first. **Within 24 hours** a recruiter called me back and offered me a position as a Business Intelligence engineer, said they had a hiring freeze for their data science team but that they really liked my profile and were able to match #3 in salary (which was a joke anyway). I declined the offer.

In all I have had mixed results. Small consulting firms are picky. Larger consulting firms are greedy. Glad I chose the company I did back in Spring, but the salary could be higher.",108,1,False,self,,,,,

I have a bunch of texts of interviews all of which mention the topic I care about, but also cover other irrelevant topics.

So, if I leave the irrelevant chunks in, it will most likley bias my results.

Im hesitant on joining the intro class since Im already familiar with python, and their modules are only going to include basic logics, functions, modules, and packages. The intermediate class will learn about deep learning, optimal algorithms, classic conversion networks, neutral style transfer, and other more advanced stuff. 
So, my questions are:
1. Should I take the intermediate class, and are the things being thought there needed in data science career? I figure if I take this class, Ill keep learning the basic stuff from Datacamp. 
2. Since Im only going for the certification, is the intro class already adequate?

We can nicely see growing likelihood of such predictions as conditional distributions when adding information from succeeding variables.

While people are used to predicting values, which can be put into excel table, we can get better predictions by modelling entire (conditional) probability distributions - starting with additionally getting variance evaluating uncertainty of such predicted value e.g. as expected value.

I have implementation and further develop this methodology - what kind of data could you suggest to use it for?

A Word / LibreOffice Writer turned fillable PDF? Webpage form? Other?

A ML model that solves a problem no business needs is useless, therefore good communication between client-consultancy-data scientist is necessary.

Working as a Data Scientist in a small startup, I want to streamline the communication between us and the consultancy team. The consultancy team interacts with different companies to understand their business needs and come-up with a data-driven product or insights. We as data scientist need to give feedback of what would be a plausible solution and develop those if the project continues.

I want to keep a document per data science project that tracks the business insights the consultancy team gained (client's KPIs, problem statements, etc) and where the data specifics are written down (labels available, file formats, etc). Basically a central document that keeps track of the project's development accessible by both us and consultancy (less technically skilled).

The workflow document would be filled in progressively as the projects moves on. Roughly my idea is to have sections like:

* Stuff that consultancy has to ask the client (data labels etc) and their business problem.
* Data Science considers which (proxy) variables a ML model could be trained for and what constraints the model would have.
* Consultancy determines if such (a) model(s) would give enough business value at what True Positive, FP, TN, FN rates and whether the client can live with the model constraints.
* Checklist before moving to deployment
* ?

I want this document to be easy to fill-in and standardized (not freely written text). Ideas I have:

1. The most straightforward solution I could think of is to add fillable fields / selectable boxes to a Word document and turn it into a PDF (requires paid Adobe PDF for the fillable fields) / LibreOffice (free and powerful, but kinda ugly: [https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/02/how-to-create-fillable-pdf-forms-with.html](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/02/how-to-create-fillable-pdf-forms-with.html))

* \+ Easy to edit for non-technical people
* \- Hard to trigger some code (necessary?) / document automatically updated by code
* \- Easy to have multiple copies of the same file if people download, edit, but not upload again

2. Webpage that is designed to be printer-friendly. Could host on some internet connected server / cloud?

* \+ A lot of flexibility in styling
* \+ Data can be automatically stored in a database
* \+ Editable from a browser
* \- More technical skill needed. Cannot be edited by consultancy and few resources online how to create a form that can be converted in a .pdf.
* \- More time consuming

&amp;#x200B;

1. Any advice on what is the best way to have a shared progress document with both consultancy and data scientist as audience?
2. Any recommendations on what to include in such status document?

Steps:


* automate data gathering about someones health, so its cheap and fast enough for most people to do all of it periodically(like once a month), or at least most of it, bloodwork, scans, diseases already diagnosed, current treatments, etc, in specialized clinics built for this purpose of data gathering.

This is the crucial step, if this is done, the rest will come more or less naturally. For this to be done, serious improvements in exam/tests automation are required, the less human work, the cheaper and faster, the better.

* everyone will slowly, increase their personal dataset with their health data
* all of those personal datasets will feed into a huge botnet central database with all the personal datasets
* this central database will be free and shared among researchers, obviously the data will be anonymized(things like person name, SSN etc will be removed) so the hit on privacy won't be as huge

This will serve two purposes:

1) The central dataset will be used by researchers using big data technology to generate PROPER science and understanding of the human body and diseases, with data-based models that actually predict disease behaviors with respectable accuracy. Current medicine models are pathetic, vague and hand wavy, because of lack of enough data to be analyzed.

2) Using the insights and knowledge generated, those can be applied into the individual datasets, it would be possible to create end-user software that detects diseases and predicts future ones, then present treatments options or lifestyle choices in a user-friendly way, an obvious example: ""your chloresterol is a little high, that can turn into coronary heart disease in X years, please consider Y lifestyle changes and/or Z medication treatment""
This is an obvious example that most already know, but with the extensive coverage of the insights gained, a lot more obscure 

Then doctors will be a lot less necessary, mostly for niche cases or giving the greenlight on the recommended actions by the software, until full blown software autonomy is viable.

But again, the cheap full health data gathering is crucial, when this will be a reality nobody knows.

Also, if theres already some research or material expanding on this idea, I would love to take a look.",10,1,False,self,,,,,

Some things to consider:  
1. Both my degrees were primarily qualitative in nature. I took introductory courses in Maths, Stats, and Computing during my undergrad; but didn't acquire any serious quantitative skill.  
2. Learning new skills does not intimidate me. I am a self-taught graphic designer and also pay a couple of musical instruments.  
3. I had a strong command over Maths and Stats before pursuing a Political Science major but lost touch over time.  


Any and all suggestions are highly appreciated:  
1. If you think self-education is a viable option; what should be my route?  
2. If you think I need a degree (or other formal qualification), what would you suggest?  
3. Can I utilise my qualitative skills and theoretical nuance in order to secure an entry-level job? If yes, what is the minimum I need to learn in order to get my foot in the door?

Its an industry that has interests in getting more information from:

* Research and development
* Clinical trials
* Quality control
* Marketing
* Patient outcomes
* Regulatory concerns
* Manufacturing processes
* Inventory

Although there are strong concerns about personal privacy and regulatory compliance, the pool of anonymized data available for analysis is one of the deepest of any field out there. Both predictive and prescriptive analysis methods provide an array of tools for organizations to use. Lets take a look at some of the basics you should know about data analytics in the pharmaceutical industry.

## The What

Analytic platforms are computing systems designed to derive insights from large datasets. Most companies in the pharmaceutical industry have access to data about drugs, groups of patients, trial participants and sales. This means analytics work in the industry is extremely diverse, with research going into things like:

* Discovering new drugs
* Studying potential drug interactions
* Planning for regulatory responses
* Preparing for future market conditions
* Anticipating epidemiological trends

The analysis performed is grounded in statistical methods that are well-known throughout the scientific and business communities. Unlike many other industries, pharma is well-positioned because many of its professionals are familiar with key concepts like:

* Chi-square analysis
* Hypothesis testing
* Scientific controls
* Regression testing

To the extent that some professionals need to develop their skills, it is usually in understanding [machine learning](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/machine-learning/), [artificial intelligence](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/artificial-intelligence/), programming and [database](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/database/) management. Most folks in the industry, though, have the necessary backgrounds to contribute to analytics work or to quickly get up to speed.

## The Why

Its difficult to overstate just how many ways pharmaceutical companies can benefit from analytics initiatives. Consider the case of bringing a drug to market. Using [machine learning](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/machine-learning/) to study chemical interactions can speed discovery by allowing researchers to examine millions of hypotheses at once. When simulations flag potential solutions, a company can then greenlight practical testing. Statistical methods can be employed to sort through data from clinical trials, too. If a drug proves its efficacy, the company can even use analytics to measure the potential market, identify regulatory hurdles and coordinate the filing of patents to maximize the time the product will be under control.

## The How

Computing power is essential. Data analytics in any field are dependent on large-scale [storage](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/storage/) and processing, but that is a much bigger issue in pharmaceuticals. Testing the number of potential chemical combinations when working with two compounds, for example, is demanding from a computing standpoint. Expand that to creating reasonable models of in vivo interactions, and you get some idea of just how massive the processing requirements are.

Similarly, [database](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/database/) [storage](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/storage/) and security are both major requirements. The amount of data that a project will require to get from start to finish can measure into the petabytes. Identifiable information about patients and trial participants has to be secured, and it also needs to be anonymized when put to use.

Companies stand to benefit from improvements in efficiency and processes. They also can produce new work products, turning research and anonymous datasets into products that universities, other organizations and even governments are willing to pay for. Not only can pharmaceutical companies save money through analytics, but they also can discover new profit centers and get drugs to market sooner.

I had been very undecided in what I wanted to study, but after taking a data analysis course in sophomore year I realized that I really like the process of understanding implications in data. Only then I started taking math courseworks and have currently completed a minor in Mathematics.

My current dilemma is that I am torn about whether to stretch myself and do a double major in Math. Initially I wanted to change my major to Mathematics but things got complicated for a number of reasons (i.e. starting major requirement late, couldn't take mandatory research seminar on time, study away issues). My school is known to have rather 'excessive' requirements for majors in general and thesis completion is also required for graduation. Now at junior fall I am faced with the dilemma of what pathway I should follow. I think my main concern is that I'm afraid my Sociology degree does not give the academic rigor in terms of mathematics/stat knowledge (especially in resume screening when applying to larger companies), plus I just find myself enjoying the statistics and econ courses more than my major. At the same time it's a little too late to discard my sociology major entirely.

Should I just bite the bullet to take requirements that are not in my interest (ex. Abstract Algebra) to complete a second major in Mathematics, or just take more useful electives in programming/statistics and focus on other projects, internships and solid thesis (in line of computational social science, whatever that may be)? Senior year will be stressful with so many other things, and I'm really not sure if overloading every semester will be worth it. At this point I am regretting not having explored Econ major option earlier on, since it seems to complement my interests much better.

I have yet to have proper 'data analysis'-related internships or work experience (just started an RA position on voting analysis in R, have to see how that works), and so really need solid advice on what's actually valued and sought after in real work.

I have a 3D space with points as features of possible words. These points are clustered on the basis of their meaning. So BMW, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar are in a single cluster called Cars. I have other clusters of different vehicles like Aeroplane, Boats, Companies and Person. Let's assume 3 patterns as :

1. Person\_1 -&gt; Car\_5 -&gt; Boat\_9 -&gt; Aeroplane\_2 -&gt; Company\_12
2. Person\_2 -&gt; Car\_7 -&gt; Boat\_9 -&gt; Company\_12-&gt; Aeroplane\_2
3. Person\_3 -&gt; Company\_12 -&gt; Plane\_6

The links represent the order of owning and the numbers represent a point in the cluster as:

1. Car\_5 = BMW in cluster Cars
2. Car\_7 = Rolls Royce in cluster Cars
3. Company\_12 = ANiceCompany in cluster Company
4. Plane\_2 = SomJetXYZ in cluster Aeroplane
5. Plane\_6 = AnotherJETXYZ in cluster Aeroplane
6. Person\_1 = WillSmith (just an example) in cluster people

and so on.

Every point is a 3d coordinate as :

1. Car\_5 = \[1.34562 , 2.54723, 0.34512\]
2. Car\_7 = \[1.45623 , 2.84562, 0.28995\]

I constructed this dataset out of my own interest to find the similarity between multiple paths so I can just cluster these paths based on their similarity and analyse what thing they buy first and why and so on. The order of owning assets and repetition of assets are important for the clustering. The condition of similarity is completely based on the order of things owned. Every point can be considered as a feature for every path.

Things I tried:

1. Forming very complete path into a polygon and finding the centroid of it but even the slightest modification causes 2 dissimilar polygons to have the same centroid thus resulting in wrong clustering.
2. Finding the area between the curves made by sequences. The smaller the area the more similar.

How can I cluster these sequences of points? My goal is to 

1. Cluster the existing sequences/paths
2. For new sequences find the most similar sequence and allocate it in the proper cluster. 
3. The number of clusters is not known from the start as the possible paths are already huge.

I am confused so as to what needs to be done here. Am I missing something?

1. Is there any resource that mentions such kind of problems? 
2. Would Sequence embedding work here? if so what can be used as an important factor to every point to embed?
3. Can anyone direct me to a sequence embedding resource which is more or less similar to this?
4. Would there be any non-machine learning solution?

My question is, is a start in analytics with a transition into full data science (with a masters in between) viable? Or should I have just shot for Data Science to begin with? Am I boxing myself in here? Or is it a normal career path?

I didn't find any other suitable subreddits for this query.

To begin with, let me paint a picture of who I am. I'm currently pursuing my Masters in *EPITA, Paris* in the field of *Data Science and Analytics*. I've been a fan of this sport since I was 12 years old, which is 13 odd years ago. Lately, I've been reading more and studying more about the sport; smaller nuances like in-depth tactics, analytical parameters and so on.

In the dream of combining my passion for Data Science and Football, I've decided to get into **Football Analytics**. I would love to work for clubs or sports firms where I can help

Unfortunately, my college only allows me to take an internship position inside France because of my amateur French level. And I can't seem to find any information of which clubs in the *Ligue 1* or so use Analytics and where and how can I apply for such positions.

So far, I plan to send these football clubs an email with a cover letter and resume attached, but I'm not sure how effective this would be. I can't seem to find any concrete information on Football Analytics in France. So if anyone here knows how to or knows anyone who is in this field, I would love to get in touch with them. 

On the other hand, I'm currently doing to projects on my own. One is related to FPL and the other is related to transfers from 00/01 till 18/19 season. If anyone is interested, I'm open to discussions about them.

There are certainly many valuable insights in this podcast, and I highly recommend everyone listen to it, but there was one specific element of it that really hit home for me - especially looking back earlier in my career:

When you are hired, you are primarily evaluated based on your technical skills. You get rewarded, reprimanded, yelled at, praised, etc., based on your ability to do the technical aspect of your work. And because of that, especially in technical roles, people start believing that it is their technical ability that will *always* get them promoted - even in latter stages of their career.

**The reality is that after your first promotion (from DS into something like a Lead DS or Senior DS role), the rest of your promotions are going to overwhelmingly be driven by relationships.** 

Now, the more cynical people may hear that and dismiss it as how getting promoted is all about politics and about brown-nosing. The reality is much less depressing - and quite a bit more practical: relationships are how things get done in an organization. Without relationships, every initiative will die a quick, quiet death in its creator's desk. So as an employee, your ability to drive successful initiatives is directly tied to the relationships you are able to foster. And that ability will grow as you have relationships that are broader, stronger, and with more powerful people.

So when organizations promote people who have built those relationships over those who haven't, what they are saying is ""I am going to promote people who will help the organization get stuff done"". And the higher up in the organization you are, the more likely it is that your ability to drive value for the organization will be measured by the scope and reach of your influence - which is basically your portfolio of relationships.

For the record - relationships do not have to be friendships. These are working relationships - these are the people with which you have established a common ground that allows you to accelerate collaboration by anchoring on a layer of shared trust. How you build that can vary greatly - with some people it may require getting to know them personally, with others it may be purely a matter of convincing them that your work ethic matches theirs. 

(PS: The podcast also covers some great advice on behaviors that people can exercise to help build relationships - surprisingly simple, but in my opinion very accurate)",10,1,False,self,,,,,

So the software I do/have used is: Alteryx primarily for combining and merging large sets of data to clean the data and get it into formats I can work with primarily in excel. Tableau I worked with at my old job for data visualization to track promotions and sales for automated reporting for our sales reps. And primarily I use excel pivot tables and macros to prepare data summaries for my analysis and for presentations. 

So my current situation is all the analyst I work with use what they know (myself included) and we all use the same software and nothing new gets used that might be better because we dont know about it until we learn about it from a conference, or see it in another presentation or just do independent research into it. But the problem Im coming across is good sources to keep up to date with these sorts of things. 

So I thought I would come here and ask other data analysts, what software or programs do you use day to day in your job that helped out a lot when you started using them?

&amp;#x200B;

By Craig S. Smith

Nov. 10, 2019

&amp;#x200B;

Data is valuable  something that companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon realized far earlier than most consumers did. But computer scientists have been working on alternative models, even as the public has grown weary of having their data used and abused.

Dawn Song, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the worlds foremost experts in computer security and trustworthy artificial intelligence, envisions a new paradigm in which people control their data and are compensated for its use by corporations. While there have been many proposals for such a system, Professor Song is one actually building the platform to make it a reality.

As we talk about data as the new oil, its particularly important to develop technologies that can utilize data in a privacy-preserving way, Professor Song said recently from her San Francisco office with an expansive view of the bay.

It is an unlikely trajectory for Professor Song, who grew up in Dalian, China, a seaport in the northeastern province of Liaoning. She is the daughter of two local civil servants with no background in computers. And while she was an exceptional student in high school, she dreamed of being a National Geographic-style nature photographer. One of her teachers, a mentor, gently dissuaded her.

Her mother wanted her to study business and filled out an application on her behalf for a well-known business school. Then, shortly before the national college entrance exams, her mentor intervened again, convincing her mother that a brighter future lay ahead for her daughter in science. Professor Song applied instead to Tsinghua University, Chinas top science university, to study physics. She went on to study physics at Cornell University but transferred to Carnegie Mellon University, where she received an M.S. in computer science before settling at Berkeley to finally finish her Ph.D. in computer science. By then, she was focused on computer security.

Professor Song drew attention while still a graduate student at Berkeley with pioneering work that showed a machine-learning algorithm can infer what someone is typing from the timing of their keystrokes picked up by eavesdropping on a network. Since then, she has been at the forefront of trustworthy A.I., including improving the resilience of machine-learning models themselves, the recursive blocks of computer code that learn to recognize patterns in the data they consume.

Machine-learning models, as amazing as they are at identifying everything from tumors in X-ray images to words in slurred speech, remain disturbingly easy to fool. Professor Song and her students were the first ones to demonstrate that computer-vision systems could be fooled into identifying a stop sign as a 40-miles-per-hour speed limit sign simply by applying a few innocuous stickers to the sign. Examples of these altered traffic signs have been on exhibit at Londons Science Museum.

Her work on the stop sign was among the first to craft adversarial examples in the physical domain rather than just manipulating image pixels on a computer, said Battista Biggio, an assistant professor at Italys University of Cagliari and one of the first people to study the vulnerabilities of such systems.

Professor Song, who has taught at Berkeley for a dozen years, has been working to develop techniques and systems that not only can provide security to computer systems, but also privacy. She envisions a world of secure networks where individuals control their personal data and even derive income from it. She compares the world today to a time in human history when people did not have a clear notion of property rights. Once those rights were institutionalized and protected, she notes, it helped revolutionize economies.

She recently started a company, Oasis Labs, that is building a platform that can give people the ability to control their data and audit how it is used. She believes that once data is viewed as property, it can propel the global economy in ways unseen before. New business models can be built on this, she said.

Data, of course, is not like a physical object. If a person gives a friend an apple, then someone else cannot have that apple. But data is different, with a property that scientists call nonrivalry. People can give (or sell) as many copies as they want.

Most people give away their data, signing it over to companies by clicking accept, not even bothering to read the fine print. Either people online accept the terms and participate in the digital world or they unplug  something that is not really an option for anyone operating in the global economy. Fortunes were built on that data, enriching a handful of entrepreneurs.

Our data has never been more at risk, and our need for new kinds of robust privacy solutions has never been greater, said Guy Zyskind, co-founder and chief executive of Enigma, another company building a decentralized private computation protocol.

When people go online, data is collected and stored on centralized servers that are vulnerable to attack. But Professor Song and her colleagues believe that by marrying specialized computer chips and blockchain technology, they can build a system that provides greater scalability and privacy protection.

Some computer chips  those in most cellphones, for example  already incorporate a secure zone, called a trusted execution environment, that protects software from most kinds of attack. Professor Songs group is working on enhancing the security of those zones by building an open-source secure enclave, Keystone. Within the secure enclave, bits of computer code, called smart contracts, allow data owners to control who has access to their data and how it is used.

You can actually have the integrity that the blockchain ledger provides and also you can have privacy or confidentiality for the smart contract execution thats provided by the secure enclave, said Professor Song, who speaks rapidly as if rushing to keep pace with her thoughts. No central server ever sees the data.

Oasis Labs has been building a platform to support enterprises and developers. They have begun a pilot with Nebula Genomics, a direct-to-consumer gene-sequencing company, that offers whole genome sequencing reports on ancestry, wellness, and genetic traits with weekly updates. Using Oasis Labs privacy-preserving tools, Nebula customers will retain full control and ownership over their genomic data, while enabling Nebula to run specific analysis on the data without exposing the underlying information.

Another application, called Kara, a collaboration with Dr. Robert Chang at the Stanford University School of Medicine, gives eye patients the option to share retina scans and other medical data with researchers who use the data to train machine-learning models to recognize disease.

Part of the Kara project is studying what kind of incentives patients will find meaningful in return for contributing their data for medical research.

Her approach is unique from other data aggregators, Dr. Chang said. This project is really asking the important question  who really owns the data?

Someday, Professor Song believes, people will have an individual revenue stream from their data. It may not be significant on a monthly or even annual basis, but the fees that accumulate over the course of a lifetime from companies using personal data could contribute to retirement savings, for example. Or revenue from groups of people could be used to fund particular causes. The unlocking of data, meanwhile, could lead to improved services for consumers.

Today, companies are taking users data and essentially using it as a product; they monetize it, Professor Song said. The world can be very different if this is turned around and users maintain control of the data and get revenue from it.

I've been  trying to find this answer for a while, but almost everything I managed to find online are guides on how  to perform feature selection / dimensionality reduction. I'm looking for something else:

The question is in the title, but I'll provide an example.

Let's say I have a dataset of pets (cat, dog, bird, rabbit...) and a bunch of features describing each pet (e.g. weight, fur, length, etc..).

All of them are already properly classified and I don't have to train a model for anything, but I wanna know per each kind of animal, which are the most representative features, example:

""Hey what's the best way to tell a bird apart from the rest?""  
""Well feathers of course!""  
""And for cats?""  
""Claws!""

I'm making these up but you get the point. Is there a way (via statistics / machine learning / whatnot) to get this kind of result?

The only  thing that came to my mind so far is a Z-test between the class distribution and the whole population, per each feature. However, it seems impractical when a dataset contains a large number of features.

Any input is greatly appreciated.

I don't have any, and while I'm good at math and can quickly grasp concepts in different courses, I think I'm still highly valuable as I have a unique blend of management experience, Data Science experience (data cleaning, wrangling, visualizations, etc), and Data-Engineering experience (not with the creation of data-pipelines and database, but experience maintaining data-bases, debugging issues with builds, Airflow issues, etc), and a little experience in Django...

While I generally enjoy doing strategic consulting my real passion is data analysis.

Over the last two years I have prioritized evolving from run-of-the-mill market research analysis towards using more advanced analytics. I use R &amp; Python now instead of SPSS, train ML models (Random Forest, Xgboost, etc.) instead of simply multivariate analysis and have dipped into advanced stuff like neural nets,etc.

I`d really like to switch towards a pure data science role because I like the work and want to get away from consultant work hours.

However in the end I do not have a CS background and while I understand the basics do not have time to really get familiar with stuff like SQL,non-analytics Python and possible languages to prototype apps and front-ends. From a practically stand point my current work really only focuses on analytics (based on mostly available data) as well as the strategic context (which questions to ask, what to do with the answers as well as consulting business on how to develop DS capabilities). None of the models I developed have ever been put into production for example.

I don`t think that would be a problem if I want to switch towards entry level data science but I feel with my business and management background I should aim higher (even if just to avoid a wage downgrade).

Taking this all together I do not know whether I am actually skilled and desirable enough for the senior level data science roles I covet.

2 years have passed and they are still promising me ""it's coming, but (insert some wait-for-it reason)"". After some time I found it hard to be programming 8 (sometimes more) hours daily and still have focus and motivation to go through courses or continue programming within working days, which left me only with weekends, but most of them I'm busy doing something else. Overtime I even forgot the things I've learned 2+ years ago.

The thing is, I'm like really really well paid to be doing what I'm doing, have great working conditions and an understanding boss, nobody's pressuring me to work harder or faster. I have days where I just slack off or stay home ""working"" and so on, nobody will tell me anything.

I am given a task to pretty much find insights about the company. I have a long list of things to do. 

I was expecting to have some BI-specialized person give me straightforward tasks and then i would do it and move to the next one. The tasks here are very vague and there is noone i can ask for an advice aside from database questions.

So i kind of plan to just exctract data to R and do analysis there. But the problem i find is that well... I have to analyze all the tables in the database but it doesnt seem very pratical for me to just analyze everything in 1 script. Is it common to exctract different subsets of data into R before doing analysis?

Another question is how much of data analysis do you do in SQL before moving to R? Or maybe you just connect tables and filter data before moving to R and do the rest of analysis from there? I am very confused at this part because I have never been in situation nor thought about that part of moving data from SQL to R &gt; I always either played with data in R or SQL. So it bothers me so much i just dont know . Should i still make summaries in SQL and filter data there or should i move it to R immediatelly ?

On top of that

There is not so much independent-dependent variable relationship in the database. The data consists of customers, bookings, services etc.. The database wasn't set up for proper analysis how i understand as there is no information about customers like who they are etc. all the data is surrounded around the booking as the main observation and for me all i can do seems to just summarize data based on 3-4-5 different dimensions like locations,etc.etc.

I was expecting to be able to apply a ML algoirihms but the database just doesn't have anything. The most useful thing there is - probably location and payment time.

In order to make sure that I really understand the steps of training a neural network, I'm trying to program a simple gradient descent algorithm line-for-line. I keep running into exploding gradients and I think it may be due to one of a couple things I talk about at the end but I'm looking for what's different between my algorithm and say something from sklearn.

My ""ground truth"" data is simply Y = 2X with a little noise.

The function that I'm learning is Y = MX + B (a straight line) with the changing parameters being M and B. I believe this is equivalent to a neural network with one input node, one output node, and a bias node. 

My cost function is C = (output - Y)\^2 

Replacing the output term with the model equation and differentiating with respect to M gives me the gradient for M:

2X(MX + B - Y) 

Differentiation wrt B gives the gradient for B:

2(MX + B - Y)

&amp;#x200B;

My algorithm runs as follows:

M = random (0 to 1)

B = random (0 to 1)

learning\_rate = 0.01

&amp;#x200B;

for each x, y pair:

  derivative\_M = 2X(MX + B - Y) 

  derivative\_B = 2(MX + B - Y) 

  delta\_M = -1 \* learning-rate \* derivative\_M

  delta\_B = -1 \* learning-rate \* derivative\_B

  M = M + delta\_M

  B = B + delta\_B

end loop

&amp;#x200B;

So each loop I also calculate the output and cost (left it out to keep the pseudocode clean). The algorithm works fine if all the training values are relatively small. But around the 30-50 range, the gradients get so large that the cost actually increases with each time step. It does so exponentially, and after about 5 time steps the numbers get so large the program crashes.

I have a couple thoughts. The first is that I should probably use a bounded activation function like tanh to keep values small. But in trying to implement this I realized I don't actually know exactly how they're implemented. Do I apply the function to the input node and the output node, or just the output node? And once I have the tanh-adjusted value from the output node, how do I get the original sample Y value back to calculate cost? The other thought I had is that maybe this is a good example of why you should min-max or z-score your data before running it through a machine learning algorithm. While I know this is best practice, sklearn modules don't seem to have this crash-your-computer problem if you don't normalize. So what are they doing that I'm not? Is it just the activation function, or are there explicit techniques for handling exploding gradients that the professional algorithms all use?

I know this was a wall of text. If you made it through thank you!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Bachelor in Media Management
MBA
6-7 years of work experience as Media Salesman, Monetization / Product / Project Manager in software companies
Some experience as a scrum master
Have been let go from my last product manager job due to strategy shift (startup) and currently applying for the next job.
Did a few courses on Python and Machine Learning online, also reading whatever I can regarding it.

I am currently thinking about doing a 3 month bootcamp in data science instead of going straight for the next job
Main reasons:
- I enjoyed more digging in data as a PM, than actually building big features.
- I enjoy talking about tech questions more than talking about design/UI.
- I have a strong interest in data science and still would love to travel back in time to tell my younger self to study business informatics at least

My ultimate goal would be do head more towards a BI/DS position after the bootcamp, instead of normal product management again.

Based on your career experience:
1) Does it make sense to do a bootcamp at this age?
2) Do you think selling myself later as a BI/DS person with business knowledge is too far fetched or not really a selling point at all?
3) How do hiring BI/DS managers actually perceive bootcamps?

I've taken a PhD course in computational python and machine learning at my university and since some months ago I've shifted my main coding language from MATLAB to python. I also have C++ knowledge which I employ to make high-performance and scalable code when necessary. 

Although I still have a couple of years to go before finishing, I would like to know which are the most important aspects of DS that I should aim to learn. Also, pointers to good resources (books, courses, etc) are greatly appreciated. I'm currently starting with ""Data Science from Scratch"" (2nd Ed.) as I have access to all O'Reilly stuff for free. Is it a good enough source? Would you go for any other one?

My idea was to start putting stuff out there once I got all the ""technical"" pieces together: play around with some Kaggle kernels and competitions even and eventually build something and sheare it on GitHub. Any thoughts?

Right now, I am in my third year of an engineering physics major with co-op, and am on track to graduate in 5 total years (this is with \~12 month work experience as part of the coop program).  However, the coop position I am likely going to accept is more along the lines of applying software engineering/data science to a research problem.   I have come to realize that my career is heading towards that direction, rather than engineering physics, and am feeling a bit stuck in my current major.  I have a couple options:

1. Switch majors into a program with a stronger emphasis on software engineering and data science.  I have the OK to do so, but it would add one year onto my graduation time, meaning I would graduate in 6 years from my initial enrolment at university.   However, doing this would allow me to also have the space to add a minor into my degree, and I have a strong interest in math and am thinking it may be a good idea to add that as a minor.
2. Remain in engineering physics, graduate in the standard 5 years, and hope that employers and graduate programs in computational math / data science would accept me despite my degree not being in these areas.

Assuming finances are not an issue, is there a clear better option here?  My worry about the first one is that taking 6 years to finish undergrad (5 years of coursework + 1 year of industry work) might be a red flag in master's applications (and possibly to employers too?), even though I did change majors fairly late.  But, I'm hesitant about the second option because I have to make a fairly significant leap between engineering physics and computational math / data science, and I feel like it's more of a risk in terms of finding employment or getting into a master's program.

Essentially, our team builds models/features and tests them on our datasets and when the time comes we start pushing it into production. We have weekly meetings with the VP of R&amp;D and Engineers who are responsible for implementing our code. We use Python and Scala and the product is not written in that.

When the times comes for implementation there is generally push back about features we would like to implement. It makes sense, things like word2vec are hard to recreate in an environment that doesn't have it and creating tables willy-nilly in Vertica is looked down upon. This has been causing me a lot of grief because sometimes things that make sense and are easy to implement in Python get push-back because it might be too hard to implement.

The only solution I can think of is someone on our team (let's say me) begins to pick up those skills needed to push things to production. However, I've had push-back from my manager who wasn't pleased when he discovered I was learning Scala during company hours and effectively said to me ""learning scala won't make you more productive."" 

What can I do in this sort of situation.

I hope this is the right place to post this. 

Im an MS statistics graduate student (with a DS concentration) graduating summer 2020. 

I am in the fortunate position of having 2 job offers and Im having a really hard time deciding which is the smarter long term choice. I have about 2 years of experience doing statistical work as a research assistant, but this will be my first big job in this field. 

Any and all advice/experience would be really helpful! 

Option A: 
-Big Finance Company (well-known)
-Senior Analyst Position
-85k base, 97k tc
-Lead my own projects (but most of them have been more SWE than Statistical in nature)
-Dream location (but higher cost of living)
-Little to no mentoring 
-Im the only stats person in a team of SWE
-Potential to move into leadership role since my skills are niche here
-I have to work while I finish grad school (Im a full-time student) and there is very little flexibility for taking time for exams/school stuff
-good work/life balance 
-2 weeks paid vacation
-Horrible work/life balance while I finish school (pushing 70+ hour weeks currently and its affecting my health). 
-More established department (Risk MGMT), bureaucratic 

Option B: 
-Big Bank (regional but still big company)
-Data Scientist Position
-115k base, 132k tc 
-Projects decided for me, but more consulting style (variety of projects), and working in teams
-Low cost of living area (but not desirable)
-Work with other statisticians/data scientists so more opportunity for collaboration 
-Finish school, take 1 month off, THEN start 
-40-60hr weeks because there are deadlines 
-3 weeks paid vacation 
-Relocation Package
-Higher 401k contribution
-Newer department (2 years old, decision science) so may function more like start up

If it helps Im in my mid-20s and Im trying to think of what decision is best long-term. 

Ive been racking my brain on this for 2 weeks now. Option B would be much easier to pick if Option A wasnt my dream city.

Watching MOOKs, reading books and doing other learning stuff is an obvious thing to do if one wants to become a data scientist.


Less obvious thing is shaping a ""data scientist identity"", which is something that goes beyond the dry knowledge and training.


More specifically, I am interested to know what are habits, routines and other activities that a successful data professional typically performs.


Examples that I've got from my colleagues-data-scientists:

Followleaders in thefield onTweeterand read every single daytheir updates: Facebook AI, Yan Le Cun, Open AI etc

Check every single day 100 trending Python repositories on GitHub (apparently most of them are data science/ML related)

Go every week to a local ML Meetup

White doing exploratory analysis, make an effort to keep your notebook clean and well documented, so you others can understand what you are doing and why

Shit happens all the time, so you must regularly back up your work. Git is a good way to do it.

And so on and so forth...


So now, what are YOUR habits and routines?

As you guessed it may be anything, from small to big, from technical to social.


What other aspects of a data scientist identity are important in your opinion?

There are several types of analytics, including approaches that are:

* Descriptive
* Predictive
* Prescriptive

When we think about answering the question of what an organization should do, that brings us into the domain of prescriptive analytics. Lets take a look at what the world of prescriptive analytics is all about and how it can benefit your operation.

**Prescriptive Analytics Compared to Other Methods**

One way to understand what a prescriptive approach actually involves comparing it to other forms of [business analytics](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/business-analytics/). Descriptive analytics helps us get a handle on what a problem looks like now and what it looked like in the past. In particular, it generally does not attempt to address questions about causal relationships. The goal, instead, is simply to lay the bag of snakes out straight.

For example, historical economic analysis is a form of descriptive analytics. An economist looking back at data regarding the[ Tulip Mania during the 1600s](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/36804/data-for-the-tulip-mania) probably isnt trying to create a model for how bubbles form in the modern economy.

The world of [predictive analytics](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/predictive-analytics/) is at the opposite end of the scale. Researchers there are trying to examine current data and trends in order to determine where things will land in the future. For example, a report on the global impact of climate change might be intended to just figure out what the heck is on the horizon.

### Prescriptive Analytics

Prescriptive analytics cuts to the core of three questions:

* What can we do?
* What should we do?
* What might others do?

The oil and gas industries are big spenders on prescriptive analytics. Exploring regions for oil, for example, opens up questions that go well beyond what descriptive or [predictive analytics](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/predictive-analytics/) can do. An oil company does need to take a descriptive view of a deposit, and it does need to predict things like global demand and supply trends. When drilling a well, an oil company has to prescribe solutions to problems like:

* Boring through rock
* Fluid and gas pressures in deposits
* Where to position rigs
* How many workers to assign to projects

These kinds of [business analytics](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/business-analytics/) are meant to assess risks, exploit opportunities and maximize returns. A state government might, for example, want to know at what grade level it should spend the most money to ensure that economically disadvantaged kids can get ahead. To do this, they have to figure out where the risks to those kids arise and what opportunities arent being presently exploited.

### Conclusion

For many organizations, prescriptive analytics projects represent their goals. Decision-makers are empowered to take action when prescriptions are grounded in hard data. Rather than producing tons of data that just goes into spreadsheets and databases never to be read, organizations can convert massive amounts of information into answers to pressing questions.

For some reason I still don't feel like I know enough about statistics if that makes sense. I've taken the typical intro to probability, statistics, regression, data collection, data analysis courses and I've passed all of them (some like regression and data collection I did well since it was more applied, but intro to probability theory and such I had a bit of trouble) but I still have this feeling I don't know enough.

I know statistics is important in terms of data science but how much do I really need to know?

When it comes to applied statistics (hypothesis tests, confidence intervals) I know what they're all about but when it comes to theoretical things, that's where I get kinda shaky. For example, a question I have as an assignment right now and I'm kinda stuck on is like, if Y|u~Poisson, and we let u~gamma, what's the marginal dist of Y. Like I get a question like this and it makes me think I know absolutely nothing about stats and I need to re-learn everything.

Likewise, I want to start the ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"" book and I'm only into chapter 2 and I understand everything that's being talked about, but in the back of my mind I have thoughts like ""Oh you're cheating you should learn more about stats before reading this book, go back and learn more stats"".

I'm pursuing my Master's in DS and I have to do a thesis. My proposal revolves more or less around the idea of mood. It has two parts:

* What semi-constant factors (education, financial status etc.) impact an individual's mood?
* Is there a general trend related to the concept of mood in general for this population or are there any significant correlations with factors found in 1?

I've structured my problem-solving in such a way that it involves a month or so of data collection. I know I could've looked for datasets online but I really wanted to dive deep with this since this is my first thesis and the problem statement is close to my heart since I have mood swings and anxiety issues.

All that said, I'm looking to solve data collection like this:

**Part 1**

&amp;#x200B;

* Ask people to fill an initial survey. My friend is ready to help me with the website. I have some experience too. The data is anonymous and they'll only be asked to input their initials (this comes in later) as an identifier.
* They fill a rather long survey for their semi-constant factors. I've figured the following out but I need help figuring more out since I want this to be as exhaustive as possible.
   * Socio-economic status:
      * Educational Background
      * Annual Income
      * Family Background
   * Habits:
      * Smoking
      * Drinking
      * Exercising
      * Drugs
   * Personal Life
      * Hobbies - Presence or not - Can be expanded
      * Community
      * Relationship satisfaction
      * Marital status
      * Self-worth - Could be a scale of 1-10
   * Anything else?
* Then, they receive a Code which would be their initials followed by a random 3-digit number. This would be secret and will be used to login for the second part.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2**

The Code will help me join Part 1 and Part 2 of Data Collection, and keep the information anonymous. Now, they will either be asked to or get a push notification (however we work out the tech side of it) to fill in how they felt on a day for 30 days. 

The first thought is to have a simple slider scale with a few tappable tags that describe their mood (need help figuring these out as well)

\----------

Once all that is done, I'll move to my analysis and modelling if all of the data collection goes well. I'm hoping to target an n of 100 at least but I know it'll be difficult. Still, I'll try to make it work. I want to challenge myself on this as well.

\----------

**Here's what I need help with:**

* More factors for Part 1 of the Survey
* Tags for Part 2 of the Survey (possibly some expert who has worked with this domain before could help)
* Anything I'm missing here which could come to bite me later
* Overall opinion about this approach and/or suggestions to make it better.

I'm a data scientist and looking to reddit for some advice... I've been in this role for about two years and have been the *only* data scientist that entire time - this was also my first data scientist role. Since entering into the new 'data' team about a year ago, we've been continuously plagued with issues like: 

* strange and distracting projects by our boss (who has no analytics experience, but a long career of software developer management) - and a lack of him be able to understand scope and true effort required for these random projects
* lack of interest in hearing from Sr DAs and me on what our ideal working environments would be (warehouse design, what we can put on our VMs, etc)
* lack of him working with leadership to build an actual understanding of business needs
* exerting random/arbitrary control over how things get done (I've never seen him do this and it end up being a *benefit* to a project)

I've stayed in the role mainly because it was my foot in the door to this industry (which I am very grateful for), and at the beginning (and to this day, really) the amount of possibilities here are huge and exciting... if they could ever be executed properly as a team. And, to add difficulty to it even more, my boss is an overall great guy - I just don't think he has the mental horsepower for such a huge change this late into career. 

My main predicament is that I've been tasked with building out a customer engagement 'engine' of sorts - so attempting to predict individually customers likely to leave, and also understand customer cohorts that are more engaged. I'm approaching it similar to a customer churn model, but with a few differences. This has been hyped for a year- the board of directors is aware of it, and so is everyone in leadership. To say the least: the hype around the team he was supposed to build is huge. That pendulum is beginning to swing back in. 

The problem is that because of my manager's disjointed priorities, we have had no progress in building out a warehouse or pipeline that helps a data scientist/me in any way. So, I'm spending time crafting ETL around extremely messy and unreliable system data which has cost me a few months just to implement that - and it isn't done, of course. He has made very little progress in figuring out that his mental model of what a data scientist does is mostly *not true* and that the slowness of this project is a result of the past year's lack of a decent strategy. 

And just for a quick, very cringe, example: a few **weeks** ago he was sweet-talked by a Harvard MBA type into trialing yet-another-vendor's autoML solution, thinking that the reason why my project has taken months to get off of the ground was simply because I was having trouble building decent models (I haven't been able to train a model, here, for months because the data didn't exist in any usable way!). And this is \*not\* because I've been quiet about the real challenges - he simply does not listen to other points of view unless it's coming down to him from his boss. 

But - to be fair - I made several mistakes when joining his team- my #1 one being that I doubted my intuition around the team's strategy. If someone has 10+ years experience managing software teams, he's this confident, and I'm this new to the role, then I need to stop challenging the status quo he's putting together. 

Recently I learned that - finally - the screws are coming down on him from his boss and he's been told to do several of the things I suggested months ago (petty for me to mention, but it feels good and is validating). But rather than him reaching out to me for advice on changing strategy, or what we can do to accelerate the project, it's more of the same. It's also too late at this point for me to give suggestions that our small team could do before the end of the year. 

**Skip to here if you don't wanna read:**

Previously, I've said to myself that I will stay at this company until I can put into production ***at least one model***. The question I'm coming to is, what do I do when the timeline for that keeps extending indefinitely and you've lost faith in management to be where you need them to be? What do I do in my job hunt when they see I've been in a DS role for \~2 years and never got to implement a model into production? If I was a hiring manager, I'd assume to some extent that this person wasn't in a *real* data scientist role and would doubt my skills/abilities. Of course I could just lie in an interview- but that feels extremely gross. 

My solution so far is to do a few ambitious personal projects that flex on modeling, python ability, and creativity. But we all know that (at least traditionally), your professional experience is the most important factor. 

So, if anyone has words of encouragement, discouragement, suggestions, whatever- I'd love to hear it. I doubt my situation is truly unique - and I also know things could be much worse. I am thankful to have gotten my foot in the door, which can be quite hard.

My boss is nice. He handled all my hiring and paperwork and was supportive.
Today we talked that he doesn't want to push me and as long as I dont stop and I can keep moving slowly with my learning and studying. I have studied and learnt more things in past 2 days than whole 2019. He said that I must focus on informing myself and acquiring knowledge and when I am more confident and independent I can start assisting projects. Also I must take initial 2/3 weeks to-
1. Get grip on my coding abilities in R.
2. Study and understand projects first- which I am already doing.
3. Understand the company and business- which is happening as a part of induction and doing one of one with the co-workers I am expected to be working with.

I really want to be successful even if it happens that I stay few months here. I want to take this opportunity to learn from them as I realized in past 3 days that my boss, my other co-worker and another one who isn't a part of data team but they all are extremely intellectual and good humans.
I want to learn as much as I can from them.

I want advice on-

1. Books or websites I can use to revise my mathematics and statistics.
2. Practice coding in R. I have real data to work and I need to understand text analysis. I am not clueless but I am a bit all over the place. Overwhelmed with information and stuff to do.

Would love to know the answer to this question as I have potentially no background in this area (to the point where I do not even know how to ask the question properly).

Im interested in the views that various religions have on data, data privacy and AI.

How do various religions feel about AI? What are some considerations on data privacy that someone from your religion may make that an atheist or non believer would not? Are there any considerations that one would need to take to de-bias data sets from the perspective of your religion? Do religions find it ethical to use AI for their own behalf, or does anyone know of any such projects where a religious body has done so (i.e. predictive models for churn / conversion)? 

I seriously dont know anything on the position for any of these issues, and would love to hear from people that do or have thought about it.

In the last years I read some books, but probably they're biased (being written by people who did it professionally, at least at some point)
- Master Algorithm by Domingos (good book, but it's sort of popular science on ML and the social aspect part is very weak IMO, because it is full of hype and reads more like a sales pitch than result of some analysis)
- Weapons of Math Destruction by O'Neill - it touches some relevant points.  I'm not sure about the validity given O'Neill's track record though - she once lamented how no one does research on AI fairness (this was in a newspaper article, it was not long ago, when there were established programs and research groups on that). Also book is very political and might sometimes be annoying if you don't exactly lean left
- Outnumbered by David Sumpter - this is by far the best book I've read, it's well balanced, like for example the author mentions different metrics that were used to assume whether algorithms made racist predictions or not.

This led me to find the Daggity website, in which they describe the basic terminologies in causality. I am still not able to discern the explanation for a ""Proxy Confounder"" and a ""Competing Exposure"". I wasn't able to visualize the existence of covariate variables because I have only studied linear modelling until now. I am not able to see how we would let variables outside exposure and outcome variables, exist. I just feel like intuitively ,we would seek to quantify every variable possible and see if they would stand to be an exposure or outcome variable. 

I was also wondering if covariate variables could refer to unquantifiable variables in my data. For example: Hope, love, etc.  If they would refer to such variables how would you go about establishing a mathematical relationship between them, when there are no numbers to go on.

Data is constantly being copied across machines, tweaks are being made on an ad hoc basis, and eventually, you end up with a model you cannot explain or reproduce.
Data Version Control (DVC) solves this problem. Using a version control workflow that will be immediately familiar to anyone who has used Git, DVC stores your model weights and training data in a centralized location, allowing collaborators to get started easily, while also tracking changes and ensuring an accurate version history.
In this tutorial, were going to use DVC to create a model capable of analyzing StackOverflow posts, and recognizing which ones are about Python. We are then going to deploy our model as a web API, ready to form the backend of a piece of production software.
While DVC makes your machine learning experiments reproducible, to deploy your model as a production backend, well need another tool. As a final step in this tutorial, were going to integrate DVC with another open source toolCortexthat allows us to deploy DVC-generated models as web APIs, ready for production.

So I am going to start working on a project that requires clustering text data and was looking for some knowledge I should have before diving into the implementation. I know how tf-idf and clustering work and most of the blog/tutorials on the web are related to that. What I really want to know is how the clusters are stored and calculated when the dataset is large and possibly incrementing.

To list down in points

1) I have a dataset of text articles for different newspapers spread across different dates. I would need to caculate cluster articles across newspapers and dates.

2) My question is since this is going to possibly large amount of data, what is the best way to go about this. Should I first calculate smaller clusters like for a day and for single newspapers and then try to construct larger clusters from this smaller cluster set.

3) Also how should I store the already calculated clusters? Possibly a list of ordering between new articles and cluster id?

Since I am working on this project from scratch, I want to do it the right way. Any reference to open source projects tackling the same problems or even blog would be really helpful.

***Background:***[ *Data Analytics*](https://ts-msme.globallinker.com/bizforum/article/analytics-business-concept-of-the-day/19087) *is the science of analyzing raw data to draw conclusions about trends and consumer behaviour and therefore it is an important decision-making tool for businesses. This article explores the benefits of outsourcing this function.*  


*Do what you do best, outsource the rest.**Peter Druck*  


Over the course of years, companies have been outsourcing all kinds of IT functions to various firms and third parties, widely varying from simple telecalling to strategic decision-making tasks. Companies such asGoogle,Alibaba.com,GitHubare just a few big names that outsource multiple IT functions such as web development and support.  


Lately, there has also been a boost in the outsourcing of data analytics which is considered as one of the highly important fields of the current day technology continuum.  


According to the prediction by Market Research Report Search Engine, the market for data analytics outsourcing is to be valued at an astounding US $20.68 billion by 2026, recording a CAGR of 29.4%.  


## But why such a huge rise? Why are companies outsourcing their analytics needs and not hiring in-house?

In the 21st centurys digital ecosystem where there is absolutely no shortage of data that can be translated into actionable insights, it only makes sense to put this data to good use.  


Multiple researches have unanimously proved the value of data analytics and business intelligence. But companies often have a certain cultural resistance, they are still picking real-world insights instead of data insights. Not only this, there is a bothersome skill gap of data scientists and analysts. 39% of CIOs and IT professionals from across industries agree that data scientists are extremely difficult to find and recruit.  


&gt;**Multiple researches have unanimously proved the value of data analytics. But companies often have a certain cultural resistance, they are still picking real-world insights instead of data insights.**

Apart from these, there are various other reasons that[Econolytics](https://www.econolytics.in/)team collated from research conducted on a sample of small, medium and large companies, they are very clear and distinctive.  


* For startups, the data scientists are very expensive, and they would rather outsource their resource requirements in the initial years, unless it becomes core to the business. When outsourcing data analytics, they will get a committed and experienced team of analysts who are skilled and have a proper knowledge at a lower cost.  

* SMEsalways want to be on top of their game, but they do not have enough time and expertise/resources to manage the data scientists themselves. Also, the impact of data driven decisions can take time to manifest and therefore, companies would rather wait to see some tangible results before investing full time resources.  

* Even with an in-house analytics professional, the chances of the resource being involved in other tasks are quite high and hence not able to concentrate on analytics. Therefore, to avoid this risk, one should outsource data analytics. The service provider will give proper data analysis and the desired result.  

* For large corporates, mostly consulting companies orKPOs, the requirements for data scientists can be quite seasonal and niche. Therefore, they are always on the lookout for specialized data experts for short term projects.  


## Outsourcing is cheaper both in terms of time and money

It is more costly if one hires analysts, project managers, and software engineers for performing analytics than outsourcing which minimizes this cost. With such an increased competition, no one can afford to waste time. Outsourcing companies have experts who know what and how to do which reduces the time required to perform analytics.  


Outsourcing companies use a variety ofspecial toolsto manage, visualize, and analyze data. They are skilled analysts who use their experience with similar past projects to come up with innovative and creative insights and visualizations of data. They alsoeffectively managesthe organizing and storing of ones vital data across different platforms. They also provide high quality service which in turn makes business decision-making easy.  


In summary, outsourcing data analytics is useful to provide meaningful insights from data that helps businesses in vital decision making. Bringing in outside partners with analytics as a core competency enables organizations to scale up and scale down while adding critical capabilities.  


However, while interviewing five CXO level individuals across industries we learnt that companies are also skeptical about parting with their data due to issues like finding quality consultants, data security risks and expectation misalignment with consultants. However, given the above benefits and doubts, they still felt that outsourcing was the best bet to at least get started. The disadvantages could be managed well if they found top rated consultants with credible work, milestone based payment solutions and standardized agreements to protect their interests.  


In a time where analytics is soon going to become a lifeline for businesss environment, it is extremely important for every business to start analyzing their data, be it in-house or outsourced.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

The average income is $839.

Nothing too difficult. But we also get a split on the Top 50 Average and the Bottom 50 Average.

Working at a small startup, and we have extracted 33 million text messages from our users. We plan to create a model to classify different types of sms relevant to us. 

First step is to create a Word 2 Vector dictionary for EDA and clustering and possibly to use these embeddings for classification further down the line .

Just wanted some guidance about the hyperparameters for the gensim's Word2Vec. 

The corpus is 33 million sms, average sms length is 16 words and the vocab size is 1.5 million. 

I used the following hyperparameters and obtained decent results but just wanted to know if I'm doing anything wrong that could be hampering the model from performing even better:

Cbow, window = 4, vector size = 125,  iterations =10, workers = 5. 

Furthermore does anyone have any tips on how to evaluate the embeddings ( other than checking that the similarity for a small set of words makes sense) so that I can fine-tune these hyperparameters? 

And final question ( I promise) Would it possible or recomendable to take a pre trained Word2Vec model and improve on it by giving it the sms data so that it learns new words like slang and typos without losing its overall knowledge of the language?

I do consulting work for one of the top 3 credit card issuers of USA (any guesses..). We mainly advise our client on strategies best for optimising profitability and reducing losses in the credit card business based on data analytics. I use mainly SAS/SQL and excel combined with business aptitude to narrow down on our solutions.

Well the reason for writing this post is because of my struggle to decide whether I should devote my time and energy to learn python/machine learning/deep learning on my own time or continue the line of work which will ultimately transition into a business role as i climb up the corporate ladder.

Let me just explain a bit of reasoning behind my struggle.
1) Currently, I have the credit card domain knowledge (banking jargons, well they do mean sth) which in itself is very valuable across banks/lending institutions.
2) No cutting edge models are in place in US lending business because of regulatory issues, but this is bound to change sometime in the future and I do not want to get fired if any recession/down sizing happens.
3) I have the fear of being left out when the whole world is transitioning into the complex world of data science and devising unique ways to reduce 'cost functions' where the only USP i have is the domain knowledge na dplaying with Excel pivots.
4) I can also counter-argue against my own above point that by the time complex data science catches up in the banking sector, I will be high up the ladder enough not to get affected by this (ever see the AVPs, VPs of consulting firms/banks, they don't know what a L1/L2 regularisation is). 

I guess the problem really boils down to business side vs core technical side. I would really appreciate quality 'consulting' into my own professional life from fellow redditors. Feel free to ask anything.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

A simple example, the Wikipedia article for Histograms lists something like 6 different methods on how to choose the best bin width, including one for non-uniform bins, but they all assume you have the totality of the data already that you can do a run over. I can try to create online version myself (e.g. by bin splitting etc), but I would like to use some math-vetted algorithms that are optimal in some sense.
From my experience, the more advanced tools (neural networks etc) are even worse in that regard, they usually presume large amounts of existing data.

Advanced excel
Python programming 
Front end web visualization (HTML/CSS)
Fundamental statistics
Databases (MySQL and Mongo)

Advanced topics (tableau, Hadoop and machine learning). 

At the end as part of the course we will also work on a project that will be added to a portfolio. 


My background is in chemistry (Bs) and pharmacology (Ms) and I am currently working in the pharmaceutical industry. I have very little coding experience but the boot camp is tailored towards beginners like me. 


So do you think the skills covered in the boot camp will be enough to obtain at least an entry level job?

In addition, do you recommend someone from a physical science background to go into data science/analytics given how competitive the field seems?

Hi People, 

I'm working on a startup, I have created a reporting tool that accumulates data from 20 different platforms. 

Currently, Im providing an on-demand solution where I fetch data from APIs whenever a report needs to be generated. 

I want to expand the number of platforms multifold, approx 100. 

Apart from data analytics, I want to provide other advanced features like clubbing data from different platforms, data comparison between platforms, etc. 

To achieve that scale, based on my research and understanding I realized that I need to normalize the data I receive from APIs and store it in my database to provide data analytics on the data apart from just reporting. 

Currently, my application is built on MEAN stack.  

What are the tools/databases I can use to normalize and save the data, are there any predefined standards or basic things which I need to keep in mind before approaching to solve the problem? Is data normalization the right approach or is there any better way?

Im an engineering student. My partner and I are doing an assignment for my data acquisition class in which we are to measure the spin decay of a yo-yo. We have two sensors: a load cell for measuring the impulse of each throw, and a remote optical sensor to get the RPM.

The problem: we used the only load cell available to us: a 50lb load cell. It turns out since the yo-yo is so light, the impulses we got are barely distinguishable from the noise we see in the data. Visually, you can see where the impulses occur, but the actual value has to have quite a bit of error in it due to the amount of noise. Correct?

My skills:

Decent with SAS, just started using it heavily this semester. I mostly did summary stats, plots/graphs, regressions, White tests, etc. A bit of both data preparation and Econometrics. 

Efficient with Tableau, also just started using it this semester and I find it great to use. 

Just started learning R as part of a data prep class, Im enjoying it so far and have a couple assignments to use it to learn more. 

I completed the intro to SQL course on codeacademy this semester as well. I havent done much with it since. 

With my semester coming to an end, Im planning on beginning my job search and want to see if I should spend more time really working SAS and my other programs, or learn something else.  

Somewhat experienced with Excel.

If you want to hope over to r/ACT, the second pinned post is actually my post about the project.

The main questions I am trying to answer is:

* What is the most effective way to study to optimize points on the ACT?
   * Is there skill overlap between subjects (will studying for only one subject correlate with a point increase on another subject)?
* How honest are people when they post scores on the internet? How high does the online ACT community ([r/ACT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACT/) and the ACT Discord) score?
* How does participating in accelerated programs, participating in sports, taking a second language, and other factors influence your score?

In addition, this project will require some advertisement analysis to find the most effective way to spread the word. I will get the data from online surveys - I've already received 120 or so submissions.

The technical test was to do a Powerpoint presentation of how I would deduplicate a dataset of 10 million rows which contains information such as name, address ect.

To me, building one myself is a waste of time, as I would just be recreating something that already exists. But obviously they thought I did the wrong thing.

I have a regression project I'm about to dive into and I have some nuances around it and some different approaches that I'm considering. So, I wanted to put them out there and see what others think or how they would tackle this problem.

I'm working with app data. When someone installs the app we hope that they become a spender. 

The goal is to build a model to predict 30 day spend based on in app activity after 7 days. For simplicity say there are two predictors only, time spent in total within the first 7 days and then any spend after 7 days. Based on these two data points can we predict what spend will be after 30 days.

The part I'm grappling with in my mind is that suppose only 1% of users ever spend at all. So my data set is heavily skewed.

Here's some approaches that I'm thinking of:

1. Ignore that skew and just build a model anyway. The majority of cases will have 0 for the second predictor '7 day spend'. This approach is appealing because it's simple and requires less work.
2. Use upsampling to pull up more spenders in my training set. This is appealing because in r's caret package, it's as simple as adding a single parameter to train().
3. Build two models. First take those players with any spend after 30 days and build a regression model based on their day 7 behaviors as discussed above.   
Then, for the larger group of non spenders build a classification model with a binary outcome of spend/not spend after 30 days. Then, for each install take the predicted probability of spend and multiply by the regression output for a user with the same level of engagement in terms of time spent in the app. This approach is more work and might get more complicated so it's less appealing, however it 'feels like it might be a more comprehensive approach to handle the large group of non spenders.

What are some ways of handling large skew in regression modeling where the vast majority of cases are 0?

One is customer demographics, such as age, gender, and various census data on their immediate neighborhood.  I've been able to cluster the data based on these census demographics into poor, affluent, student communities, young families etc. and apply these labels to each customer.

The other dataset is their transactions. The transactions are at the store level e.g. spent $20 in this cafe, $50 in this store and so on, so unfortunately I can't really do any sort of market basket analysis or recommend specific products. I could probably build a recommender system based on stores, but I'm not sure if that's commonly done. Every single tutorial I've seen has been at the product level.

I'm just wondering if there are any tools you guys would recommend that I explore in a marketing/customer transaction context.

At the moment I've explored the python lifetimes library: [https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes) to estimate probability of churn, future purchases and customer lifetime value. Very easy to use library with promising results and will stay in my toolkit.

I've also segmented the customers based on RFM scores, didn't take very long to do. However something in the back of my head is telling my this is way too simple. 

I've also attempted to build a churn model based on customers who have closed their accounts (4% of the dataset), but results are terrible.

I'm about to apply to masters programs in analytics/data science for the upcoming fall and am wondering if I have a chance of getting into a prestigious program. I'd like to get an analytics degree at either Georgia Tech, Northwestern, or North Carolina State.

My hindrance is that my undergrad GPA in industrial engineering was fairly low (3.24/4) from a large state school (Auburn). However, I have a GRE quantitative score of 166 and just finished a six month contract as a quantitative analyst for a fortune 50 company (and have started a subsequent six month contract at the same position). Additionally, I have an undergraduate research paper based on statistics that is currently in revision review for getting published. I hope it gets published in the next couple of weeks so I can put that on my application. My question is: do I have enough to get into the schools listed above? I'd really like to further my learning and I think a degree from one of these programs could be huge for my career. Does anyone who had a lackluster undergraduate profile who got into a great program have any advice for what to highlight in the personal statement to stand out? Should I address my low GPA or just avoid it?

I am working on deploying a shiny app in my client's environment. The main use case as we understand is that they want to be able to access the app from any computer on their network.

So essentially, I am thinking if i could run the app on Rstudio Server (not shiny server) and keep it running then all other users would be able to access it through a url. 

What are the cons of this? Would it affect the speed of the app if too many concurrent users are hitting the app at the same time? Also, would access control be possible through this?

&amp;#x200B;

The other option which i have gotten to know is by acquiring a linux server and deploying it on that. For this method, i want to know how one would do that ? and also what advantages &amp; disadvantages it has compared to the Rstudio server.

I graduated from UCB as a Business Administration undergrad in 2015, and since then have been doing a slew of different jobs ranging from production planning, project management, negotiating/purchasing, and some analytics on the side. Over the years my job has become less analytic, and more about driving results on timelines and keeping the project on schedule.

I've recently been considering Galvanize Bootcamp as a way to grow my analytical toolset and pursue a data science career. In the past, I've used SQL &amp; Excel for the analytic projects I've done. 

Does anyone have any insight into how valuable a Galvanize bootcamp graduate is in the Bay Area? I was unable to find recent reviews of the program, though the posts from 2-3 years ago seem positive for the most part. 

I am taking the Galvanize prep class in my spare time, and really enjoying it, but wondering if the high price of the bootcamp will be able to give me a good return on my investment, as I will be funding the program myself and not receiving employer support. What do Bay Area employers think of the Galvanize bootcamp? Are there other recommendations to kickstart my data science career?

Each event can occur multiple times in one file. The files can vary greatly in number of events, frequency of events, and total time span.

The data in each file looks something like this:

Event\_A 0:02

Event\_C 0:07

Event\_C 0:09

Event\_E 0:15

Event\_B 0:20

Event\_A 0:34

Event\_G 1:12

I want to find clusters of similar files. By similar I mean the same type of events occurring at similar times and in similar orders. For example, if both file 1 and file 2 have event A occurring around 1:00 and event B around 3:30, theyre considered similar. If file 3 has event A around 1:00 and event B around 5:00, its less similar to file 1 and 2.

My main questions are:

1. How to structure the data for clustering analysis? Most examples are tabular, but my data is not.  I thought about something similar to a document term matrix, with each file as a row and each event as a column. However, it seems difficult to capture the time and order of events.
2. What kind of algorithm can I use to find clusters?
3. I would like to weight the events so that the earlier an event is the more important it is in determining similarity. So for example if file 1 and 2 are identical for the first 5 minutes, but differ greatly after 5 minutes I would like them to be considered very similar.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Intro to Programming

Programming Principals I (Topics include primitive data types, number systems, file I/O classes, control structures, method design and usage,  arraysorting and searching algorithms.)

Programming Principals II (Topics include composition, recursion, data abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, inner classes, abstract classes, object cloning, array lists, linked lists, and exception handling.)

Data Structures (Topics include linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing, recursion, complexity analysis of algorithms, binary search trees and heaps)

Algorithms (This course studies data structures and algorithms, with emphasis on algorithmic strategies such as dynamic programming and emphasis on non-linear data structures such as trees and graphs.)

Relational Database Systems

Data Mining

Big Data Analytics (This course covers the challenges that arise when the size of data to be analyzed outgrows the limits of traditional data analytics systems, the new challenges big data computing introduces and the evolution of the big-data ecosystem. Additionally,  the course touchs upon classical subjects such as MapReduce, modern approaches such as Spark and the approaches of analyzing semi-structured and unstructured data.)
