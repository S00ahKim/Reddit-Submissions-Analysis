I have experience in R, Stata, some minor experience in C++ and a basic ability to write in SQL and Python. I also completed a 10 week internship with a utility company that taught me some, albeit basic, methods for implementing machine learning to produce predictions models for large datasets.

My questions are more specifically phrased as follows:

1. How should I improve on my Python skills with respect to statistics applications? Nearly all of the resources I find online about improving one's Python skills with respect to the tech industry focus more on the coding aspect than on statistical analyses. For example, most of my CS friends tout the Cracking the Coding Interview book as one that I should know cold yet it does not focus at all on statistical applications. Should I be utilizing these resources?

2. What kind of tech jobs with a statistics background do not require an MS or PhD? I am not sure that I would want to pursue either in the future as my theoretical math skills and understanding are rather shaky. Yet nearly all of the jobs I find on my university career site are oriented to individuals with MS or PhDs in Stats or CS.

3. What kinds of career fairs should I be attending? The general one by my university has companies that are generally not looking for very technical roles for their hires yet the CS career fairs naturally are looking for very technical CS students.

Overall, should I be doing the same things as my CS friends to make myself more attractive to tech companies (ie interview prepping coding problems, hackathons, attending technical career fairs oriented to CS majors, etc.) or should I be focusing on something else entirely?

Generally, I have an interest in predictive modeling but I am unsure of what I generally should be doing and internet, and university resources, give many conflicting answers on the topic.

Thanks for all your guys help!

I'm research assistant at neuroimaging lab that is behind a large-scale data sharing project. Recently, we've been organizing our data (brain images stored in a modified version of a medical imaging file format) on a filesystem according to a standard proposed within our field (the Brain Imaging Data Structure / BIDS; http://bids.neuroimaging.io/). Essentially, the way this standard works is that file names are composed of multiple key-value pairs. The key and value are separated by a dash, and distinct key-value pairs are delimited by an underscore. So the file name: 'sub-01_ses-01_task-stroop_bold.nii.gz' would indicate that the file contained task-related data from the first session of subject 1 where the subject performed a stroop task in the MRI scanner ('.nii.gz' is the format, NifTI compressed w/ gzip and 'bold' describes the type of MRI sequence used for imaging). This file would be nested within several directories- the hierarchy would be composed of some of the key-value pairs as well as a directory name that indicates whether the scan was task-related or just a single volume anatomical image (so the file in the above example might be stored at 'basedirectory/sub-01/ses-01/func/sub-01_ses-01_task-stroop_bold.nii.gz'). Additional metadata for the file would be stored within a JSON file with a filename that is identical to the file's except for the filename extension.

Since my background isn't in either comp sci or stats originally, I was wondering what people from these fields (or who've successfully migrated to data science / engineering from an unrelated field) might think of this manner of dealing with data. I'm also wondering if there isn't a more generalized scheme for organizing datasets on filesystems / dealing with proprietary or niche formats.

One thing that I've come across is that many people are opposed to working with data entirely on a filesystem, preferring instead that it be in a database of some flavor (NoSQL, SQL, etc) due to increased performance. Would this preference still hold for niche scientific data formats? If so, what kind of database would be ideal for this kind of problem? I was looking at Elasticsearch / other document-based databases, but I'm still a little new to this and was wondering how a more experienced data engineer might approach this problem.",10,6,False,self,,,,,

This confuses me. 

Do these recruiters even know what a masters degree is ? One of them included people with a masters in economics for a data science job. 

FYI - I can't afford the fees to get a masters. 

EDIT:

Oh - I am from Australia.

Okay you guys are not really answering my questions. You're telling me why a PHD is superior to an undergraduate degree. No shit. That should be obvious. Basically this tells me one of two things: Either these jobs are for actual scientists in research or you're just trying to corner market and protect. But it still doesn't answer the question. 

What is exactly about the JOB of a data scientist that requires a Masters or PHD that cannot be achieved through work experience ? When you ask for a masters in ""something technical"" by a recruiter that is NOT telling me that the job is necessarily a scientific one for a variety of reasons. It is starting to sound a lot like qualification inflation. What I suspect is that the recruiter is sick of getting applications (due to the recent hype) and has decided to slap the term ""masters"" on it to discourage applications from so many people. I don't know this for sure which is why I am asking. What exactly does a data scientist do ? Why do you need a masters for it ?

I have a lot of experience as a data analyst. Saying ""SQL is not taught in undergraduate so you need a PHD to learn SQL and Python"" is not helpful. I already know both of them. Maybe even better than a PHD graduate, who knows.  I am looking for a career pivot as I am getting very, very bored. Getting a masters is not an option. Even if the tuition was zero, I'd be giving up at least 2 years of income, then would be back to square 0 looking for work. I haven't had to look for a job in almost 10 years.

If I have misread the job title of a ""Data Scientist"" and this is a job requiring actual scientists, then fine that is not an option for a career change. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing for now and see what else is available. Also if this has become hyper competitive due to the hype, then I also don't want it.  

I wish someone had told me my statistics degree was going to be useless without a masters. I would have just done computer science instead.

This is my first Reddit post so please be kind :).

I am very interested in everything related to AI. I am currently working as a programmer, but for some reason I don't find pure programming to be that fulfilling. I have always been interested in Mathematics, and thus data science is my main area of interest.

I am going for my MS this year, but I am a bit confused as to whether I should go for MS in Data Science or MS in CS. I've read a lot about this topic, and some people insist that data science is just a trend that will wane, and instead of an MS in purely data science which is pretty narrow, I am better off pursuing MS in CS and take some extra electives related to DS.

Would really like some practical advice on this.",26,2,False,self,,,,,

I know the general consensus at least here is to stay away from the new ""made up"" degrees like Master's in Data Science and instead opt for more traditional CS, Math, or Stats degrees.

That said, the more theoretical aspects of some of the hard core math based degrees start to scare me off. I was an engineer as an undergrad and took three semesters of calc, differential equations, and linear algebra so I have a background in those areas. However, none of my classes dealt with proving theorems or needing any in depth understanding of the actual theories behind the math. Also, I've only taken maybe 2 stats courses as an undergrad. all of this was a few years ago at this point. All of this is to say that going for a masters in statistics is a bit of a terrifying proposition.

has anyone on here gone for Stats/Math with no great background in the subjects? Any advice at all when it comes to how these masters in statistics programs are usually laid out in terms of theories versus applications?",10,5,False,self,,,,,

I know there are multiple methodologies and I'd love to get input on how you would approach a problem like this:

Let's say I have a survey of 100 questions. I give this survey as a pilot to 50 respondents. My end goal is to reduce the number of questions asked of a single responder by creating multiple versions of this survey (so, for example, we might split the survey questions in half for an A version and a B version, and ask only A or B to a given responder). To do this, I can use the relationships found between questions/responses in the pilot survey. I'd also like to use these relationships to come up with a good way of predicting any unasked questions (so, if a responder got version A, I'd like to be able to predict/impute how they would have responded to every question in version B). Note that the # of questions to reduce isn't set, so reducing fewer questions is okay, you can assume that there are no missing values, and all of the responses are on a likert scale of 1-7. 

How would you approach a problem like this? What methods would you use? How would you assess how well you've made the split and predictions?

As background, in my first run-through on this, I split the questions in half (randomly), and using a linear model to predict the response to each question given the responder's answers to all other questions in their version of the survey. I compared multiple splits on multiple population with the goal of minimizing the MSE of the models. I know there are varying philosophies on how to treat Likert scale data, so if you have alternatives that better accommodate that data type, I'd love to hear about those too.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

-----------------------------------



**My Background:** 

* I work in advertising, specifically social media
* About 5-6ish years experience
* I manage one employee, looking to add another over the next few months as workload is increasing
* Undergrad was BA in Business Administration (the most math I learned was business calc and I barely remember anything...if anything).
* Very familiar with web design related code (HTML, CSS, but that's about it). Taught myself, so I'm pretty adept to the thinking...just need to know where to apply it next.
* My job (without saying the exact title) is along the lines of comparing social conversation data to brand social page data, social ad spend data, and any other data to draw insights from.
*Among others, I currently have access to Brandwatch (agency just signed a huge contract with them so I need to take full advantage. working with another analyst in the agency on using their API, SDK, etc to make dashboards...but that's all him) which is my daily tool for working.
* **I don't plan to relocate or find work elsewhere for learning. I have a job I love, and it's growing in responsibility and complexity. To reap the rewards for how I've been growing the role, I need to show a long-term curve for advancing it, using data in more complex ways to make better insights.**

**My Problem:**

* I'm reaching an impasse in my abilities; I feel that I can do much more with more advanced techniques (i.e. code) but I don't know how or what.
* I need to up my game because right now it's a matter of workload vs. staffing vs. time. I need to be able to manage mine and my employee's time more efficiently so we can spend less time wrestling Excel or Powerpoint, and more time drawing insights from the data.

**My Thoughts:**

* I've been considering getting my 'graduate level' education in Data Science
* I have no clue where to begin
* I have no clue what programming language would benefit my situation / team best (don't want to waste time / effort learning something I don't need)
* I've explored a lot of options on Coursera, Udacity, you name it. None are standing out to me as ""START HERE!"" they just all look like they want my money.

**My Questions:**

* Given the above, what do I begin learning to advance my role?
* What programming language do I start learning?
* What are the benefits to learning the programming languages associated with so-called 'data science'? How does learning any of this **specifically** help me? 
* What tools / platforms / etc can I get my hands on right now at a free or low cost that I can start tinkering with the huge data sets I have access to now? (i.e. code editors? no idea...)
* Without having to spend $20k on an entire graduate degree (I have way too much debt to go back to school. My best bet is to stay working and learn what I can), what paths or sequence of courses should I start taking? Links appreciated.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently on the first year of a maths degree (mature student) at a non russel group
university in the UK (the russel group unis are the better ones). Realistically
I'm probably only going to be able to get through around 3 books before I finish
University.

### So - could you suggest me three books that would be the best foundation for your job, why you suggest them and say what your job is?

I have interests in maths, programming, visuals... but it's probably easier to
read through and apply that to myself than others trying to guess what
would suit me too accurately.

I was planning to go through Spivaks Calculus and some Abstract Algebra, but I'm
thinking that other sources might be more appropriate. (these would have been
more suitable if I was still going to go into teaching I think). I know some really good resources for 
maths but for data related stuff, stats, etc.... I'm not too sure. 

I wouldn't imagine that Real Analysis, Abstract algebra are that relevant to
data focussed jobs in general. In comparison to stats and comp sci at least.

I've heard Think Stats is good, and I've used some python so perhaps that would
be something. 

cheers!!

I've done a ton of research on the topic, so I generally know the bare minimum of what I need: quad-core Core i7 (or Xeon?), 256 GB SSD, and 16 GB. That is fairly easy to find. I've also read that for deep learning and other machine learning methods it's nice to have a GeForce GPU. (I haven't worked with these methods myself, but I'm trying to future-proof myself with this purchase.) My budget is $1,000-$1,200, so it will be hard to fit all of this in, especially the GPU. This all gets to the question of whether I should just go with the quad-core processor, SSD, and 16 GB of RAM setup and spin up AWS and EC2 instances to handle the rest (I currently have no experience doing this, I've just read about it on this sub and elsewhere)? Is that probably the most cost-effective option? Should I just learn how to do that anyway since it's a marketable skill? Is there anything else I need in terms of hardware?

My experience thus far is pulling relatively small datasets using SQL and working with them in R. However, as we all know, data science is about lifelong learning, and I want to keep pushing forward as a data scientist and work with larger datasets and more advanced technologies. In purchasing a machine, I don't want to make a decision that will hinder that in the future.

I've read a lot about what I need but at this point I'm overwhelmed, and everyone has different needs so I'm hoping to get some advice based on where I am as a data scientist.

Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I go. 

Keras - the Python library for deep learning. I just started using it, and I'm confused by one issue that I keep having.

So I'm working with a somewhat large dataset - 1.5mil rows. It's text data, after passing it through tfidfvectorizer in scikit-learn, and afterwards dimensionality reduction with random projections, I end up with a 1.5mil x 500 dimension matrix, a very sparse matrix. 

	&lt;1483700x500 sparse matrix of type '&lt;type 'numpy.float64'&gt;'
		with 22120738 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format&gt;

I was trying to pass this into Keras `model.fit` but apparently it doesn't accept this datatype. When I try `.toarray()` on it, I get a memory error (it's just too huge) so I tried instead to train on batches of my data (500 rows at a time) so it would be something like

    model.train_on_batch(X_train[0:500].toarray(), y_train[0:500])

My question is, am I doing it right? I mean, is this the only way I can train on this dataset or is there a way to shove a sparse matrix type (compressed sparse rows types to be more precise) into the fit method?

On this note, is there a way to pass this type of matrix into sklearn's PCA (or truncated svd?) too? I get sparsity errors in that situation which made me choose random projections instead of PCA.

I'll provide some perspective on my current situation:

I Did my undergrad at University of Portland, majoring in Operations and Technology Management, with the following being the most relevant coursework:

* Optimization
* Programming and Simulation in R
* Business Analytics
* Database Management
* System Analysis &amp; Design

After graduating in December with a GPA of 3.7, I started a full time position as a Data Reporting Analyst immediately after. Additionally, I have intermediate/semi advanced experience with R, VBA, and SQL, and I've been learning Python for about a month now. I fill my free time with tackling side projects I create myself that focus on skills I currently don't posses (like machine learning). 

Lastly, I've currently started taking Calc. 1 at my local state school, with plans to continue into Calc. 2, linear algebra, and higher level stats to fill my gap in classical math skills.

My first question is **Where do I go from here, which schools/programs should I be considering, and is admission attainable with my background?**

The graduate programs I've been eyeing lately include:

* NYU's Data Science MS
* University of Washington's Data Science MS
* Caltech's Ph.D in Applied + Computational Mathematics
* University of Washington's MS in Applied Mathematics
* Michigan's MS in Applied Statistics
* Graduate programs in Operations Research

After perusing though this subreddit for the past few months, I believe the popular opinion is that data science masters are worth relatively little compared to a MS in math or statistics. While I would prefer to go to grad school in something more traditional like math or stats, my concerns lie in my background, even though I know I would succeed in those programs. 

My second question is **What is your guys' opinions on Operations Research graduate programs?**

With my background being in Ops. &amp; Tech. Mgmt, would I be better off pursuing an OR degree? I know that both Columbia and MIT offer grad degrees in OR, but I am uncertain that I would even have a shot at getting admitted there. 

I know I am on the right track, I guess I just need some guidance in terms of understanding what is achievable for being admitted to a grad school given my background. ",4,5,False,self,,,,,

I'm a 27 year old male form the UK looking for a complete change of career into data science/statistics. 

Basically I need to get some qualifications. There is a suitable 'conversion course' of sorts in data science. The alternative is to basically go down a lengthy process of an undergraduate degree in stats and then a postgraduate in stats. It would take me half the amount of time and be considerably cheaper if I was to go down the data science route.

My only concern is that I wouldn't be as qualified if I did the conversion course rather than the stats course. 

Basically my question is what are the main differences between data science and stats? The differences seem to be pretty unclear from what I've read. Are statisticians generally more qualified than data scientists, can they command a higher wage etc?

My university has a building on campus where electrical usage and water usage is monitored down to the second. All electrical loads and all water usage (each faucet, toilet, shower) is tracked and stored in a SQL database. In the water dataset, the column headers are the location, and the rows contain the gallons used (per second). In the electrical dataset, the power consumption (in Watts) is tracked in the rows and the load type is the column header (lights, water heater, outlets, refrigerators, etc...).

I am in my second year of university, focusing on machine learning and data mining, and I am hoping to investigate this data for a personal research project.

My general problem is as follows: - **how could I use the data from this highly monitored building, to benefit the university and give them insights into buildings that aren't monitored like this one?**

My data is of the time-series, so I am trying to think of certain clustering or classification algorithms that could help me extract actionable data from it, and perhaps even association rule learning to find relations between the water and electricity data?

I believe my time would be better learning the tools and language too become a data scientist rather than going the safe route and pursuing the Bachelors in CS.

I have seen the Open Source Masters Program from Google and also a Primer for a Data Science BootCamp Galvanize.

These are the courses I am taking and want to take in the next 6 months - year and then pursue a bootcamp to hopefully lead into a job and work on my masters after.

Background of classes during college:

1) Econometrics - Aced it.
2) Finished Multivariable Calculus Series
3) Passed AP Stats in High School (4)
So I feel i have a good understanding about probabilities, linear algebra, and a basic understanding of statistics.

Courses I am going to take: 

1) Learn Python The Hard Way
2) Intro to CS - edX
3) Machine Learning - Andrew NG (Stanford)
4) SQL Zoo
5) Intro to Data Science (CS 109) - Harvard
6) Learn the libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matlab)

Background: I have been learning R for the past 6 months through several training courses, tutorials, sample problems, and finally probing the data that I am interested in: sports/NFL data.

I would like to develop a model that ranks players by position. For example, Larry Fitzgerald is a great Wide Receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, but where does he rank among all WR? Using simple metrics like total yards gained, total catches, total touchdowns, etc. don't successfully answer this question. 

There are other factors that affect Larry Fitzgerald's stats: 

* Quarterback throwing him the ball

* Quality of the opposing defense

* Talent/rank of the other Wide Receiver's on Fitzgerald's team

* Etc.

What I would *like* to do is find a way to rank Larry Fitzgerald based on the combination of all these factors. I feel like some kind of network analysis is the answer, but I could use a nudge in the right direction.

I am a bit stuck, however, before I have even started. I was wondering whether people could direct me on how to construct the architecture of the whole thing. Firstly, what steps would I need to take to create a real-time data pipeline from the app? Secondly, where would this data pipeline lead to and what sort of software would I need to utilise this data to build a recommender system. Can the recommendations be updated in real-time, every time a user interacts with the app? And lastly, how would I feed the recommendations back to the app so the users can see them?

I am fairly low on the data science totem pole (good at excel, so so at R and very much a beginner at Python). I am working on developing my skills, but with such an abundance of resources out there I was wondering what worked for you. Basically I want to do some meta learning. 

I am reading a few books to develop my skills in Python and R, as well as a machine learning book to provide ideas with how to use them. I was planning to look into specific case studies soon. I have tried some coursera and EdX classes, but so far those haven't aligned with my particular projects.

I don't necessarily want specific resources from you guys, but rather what processes you used to develop. For example: I started with an applied book to get the basics down, then I read a case study to get deeper into how I could specifically use the tools, then I read a theory book to really understand what I was doing and how I could do it better.

I am a recent (1 year ago) PhD graduate from Physics (experimental, condensed matter) who has spent the last year working on my own start-up and in general staying up to date with the machine learning community and publications. I'm not sure the best way to continue from here towards building a career and figured it would be best to just ask. 

My startup was based around a lot of natural language processing applied to scientific abstracts and data. However, because of the nature of startups (And doing it alone) I ended up spending some 95% of my time working on full-stack development (hosted a site on AWS with a full data pipeline, sql, message brokers, ec2 cluster scaling, etc.).

Other experience I have directly in data science come from my self-study of machine learning in general (learning the wide variety of techniques and tools available), and more recently (past 2 years) teaching and mentoring of many of my friends and colleagues in data science (some of whom have jobs doing data science now). 

During my PhD I also did work in CUDA and am working on getting a patent on this for some largely parallel real-time data processing tools I created. 

For my PhD in general, I worked largely and mostly in analyzing and modeling a specific type of 4D data sets, traveled around the world taking data and organizing it, and everywhere I went, automating scientific equipment (I don't like turning a knob when I can get the computer to do it). 

For my undergrad I got a double degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering, with some research experience in cognitive and adaptive radio (which is somewhat related to the larger goal of getting into machine learning and data science).

All in all, I consider myself to be ready to take on almost any challenge in data science, but I am frankly a bit worried that I will be left bored and frustrated with whatever job I get if I just apply and accept whatever job offers the most income. From my friends in the field and my own experience, it seems like the meat of the work is usually just data-pipelines, scripts for data visualization, and full-stack style development: and frankly I want to avoid these things and focus on more challenging and engaging machine learning problems. 

***TL;DR*** This brings me to my final question: should I be focused on trying to just get any job, even if it isn't doing novel data science like I would like and try to build a name for myself in the community, and likely hop between jobs until I find something that fits me personally? Or, should I instead invest my time in doing direct data science myself (prototyping new architectures and bench-marking them, etc.), working on kaggles and making my attempts and code public, trying to gain notoriety that way through the scientific side? At the end of the day, the dream is to work at a company like DeepMind or OpenAI, but I recognize that my resume just isn't quite up to snuff yet and I'm wondering where I should go from here to make that happen.

I am the main data guy at a start up but I am only a few years out of uni so still feel pretty green.
I studied Comp Sci and Statistics and I have done a fair bit of kaggle in the past so when I got the chance to work as a junior data scientist at a small start up 6 months ago i lept at the chance.


But now that I am working on my own with nobody to fall back on or learn from I am finding it really hard.

I feel like a bit of a sham and now I am expected to build all these fancy models and I just don't feel like I have enough experience.

I think I have gotten by for so long because I can write SQL and do some automation in Python and been building some dashboards and reports but very little actual data science.

Anyone else working in this field and don't feel qualified enough? I get paid pretty well but don't feel justified calling myself a data scientist yet and I think its possible I will be let go if I don't start producing some high value work.

I've been with a start up for about 6 months now and the role has been entirely not as advertised since day one. I'm spending about 90% of my time in sales calls when I was hired as a data scientist. Additionally, work life balance was pitched as everyone working no more than 40 hrs/week, but I almost never work less than 50.  I know that isn't criminal, but the hard sell on the hours was a reason I took the job.

At this point I fear my skills are going soft and I'll have a hard time finding something else if I don't act soon. There's no sign of me getting to move to a more data-focused role in the foreseeable future.

I'm trying to transition to a career in data science or something closely resembling it and I'm debating the merits of going back to school to help fill up the gaps in my skills/education.

A little context, I currently have a master's degree in economics and work for a company building and implementing economic models. In both my education and current job I have a lot of experience with econometric techniques and working with data more generally. In undergad/grad school I used STATA and for the past year or so I have been learning R through coursera, datacamp, textbooks,  youtube videos and some personal projects. 

I have learned a ton over the last year but I still feel like I am very far away from being competitive for a datascience job opening. I currently don't have any real experience working with SQL, but other than that I think I have the appropriate skill set to work as a data analyst at some level. 

With my econ background I am relatively comfortable with statistics and many of the machine learning concepts but what I truly lack is skills/knowledge/experience relating to computer science. Outside of R, and some really entry level python tutorials/videos, I don't have any programming experience or skills. I am currently mulling over options regarding going back to school and I was hoping to get some input from r/datascience. 

I am very intrigued by some of the master programs specifically for data science, like Cal Berekely's and the University of Washington's program. I know that these types of programs are newer and there isn't a strong consensus on how their graduates do in industry. I have also thought about doing a bootcamp program but again don't know if it would be optimal given my current skill set. My third option would be doing some sort of post-bac or certificate program solely in computer science to help with my biggest weakness. 

Other factors at play, I have strong grades/test scores/work experience/references so I do think I would be competitive for some of the MS Data Science programs. I also don't have any existing student loans or debt, so while it is still a sizable investment I have some financial flexibility in going back to school. I also really love school and learning, and it has been frustrating trying to self-teach myself so much while still working full time. 

Has anyone here successfully transitioned from a traditional economics background to a datascience career? My end goal is to work at the intersection of politics/public policy and datascience. Either working for the government to harness data for better policy design and outcomes, or to work in political consulting on the analytics side. Any thoughts, advice, or tips would be greatly appreciated.

I'm trying to figure out if a particular study is double-blinded or triple-blinded. I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to ask this, but among the ones I've seen, you guys seem to be among the most helpful and knowledgeable on this subject. The study in question is this one: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423791

Just in case you can't read the whole thing, here's the part that is puzzling me:

*""A randomized controlled design with repeated measures was adopted in this study. A total of 118 participants were recruited from May to December 2014 at cardiac inpatient wards in one hospital in Chengdu. The cardiac nurses identified the potential eligible participants via in-person interview. Eligible participants were randomly allocated into either the experimental or the control group prior to discharge by means of computer-generated random numbers by the researcher. Allocation concealment was achieved by enclosing assignments in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. Participants in the control group received usual care only, while participants in the experimental group received usual care plus the 3-month multidisciplinary supportive program. The usual care was health education about heart failure provided by nurses during the hospitalization and at discharge. In addition, information and consultation about heart failure were available on the ward during the hospitalization.""*

Now I know that both the participants and the independent data collectors were blinded, so it's at least a double-blinded study, right? However, I don't know if the researcher who made the randomisation is blinded. If a study speaks of allocation concealment, does it necessarily mean that the researcher is blinded? And if not, since the study doesn't say who gave out the envelopes to the patients, how can I be sure if it is double-blinded or triple-blinded?

Like many others, I am struggling to map a path forward that will enable me to reach my goal in the most efficient way possible. I also want to know the feasibility of my goals here since I do not have a real math or stats background.

**My background:** 32 years old with ~8 years' experience in the advertising &amp; marketing field. I started as a copywriter and transitioned into digital ad campaign management before becoming a marketing manager for a digital advertising agency. I am intrigued by big data and its impact on market intelligence and targeting. I live in a country in the Persian Gulf with no Data Science scene, but plan on relocating in about a years' time (probably back to the US, but perhaps Dubai) where I can network with people in the field.

I hold a BA in Communication (ie Mass Comm) and an MBA. I was exposed to stats through a masters' level class and while conducting my thesis. I learned how to use SPSS, clean &amp; transform data, run parametric tests on my data and interpret the results, although it took me a while to grasp the concepts. As far as programing is concerned, back in college I created HTML/CSS websites for fun and took a Visual Basic programming class.

At this point I already have some pretty strong domain knowledge but my stats understanding is basic and I have to start learning new programing languages. I always struggled with math, but can get to the required level of understanding if I put in the effort.

Since I would like to remain in the marketing field, I am looking at the following path forward:

1) Master Google Analytics

2) Master Statistics &amp; Probability

3) Learn Python, SQL and R (Should I learn all 3?)

4) Participate in real-life projects to get practical experience, either at my job or on the side 

5) Quit my job to relocate 

5) Join a bootcamp in the US or EU to further strengthen my skills and make contacts

6) Look for a Data Science job 


Does this sound like a realistic plan to you? Am I missing or underestimating anything? Does it matter whether I start learning programing or stats first?

For our school example, I'd get the t-SNE output, then I would label the datapoints. (Let's assume that the clusters are actually representative of age/classroom, e.g. the first-graders group together, the second-graders are a group, etc.)

If I try to color this plot with ""grades"", I'll see that the grades does not really explain the structure of this plot. (Why? Because every class-level has students with As, Bs, Cs, etc.) Then I might try height...that does pretty good (because there's a correlation between short students--&gt; pre-school, tall students --&gt; high school seniors). 

How does one use a t-SNE plot to infer the ""most correct"" labels of the data? How does one use t-SNE plots to explain (and further explore) the plot structure?

i'm wondering if anyone has done any of these programs, thoughts on them, which are good/better, if they are worth the effort or if private study/projects/etc is just as good, etc.

me: comp sci degree, 2001, mid tier school, decent math and programming, both of which have atrophied through disuse.  i primarily do data related activities which i am pretty strong at.  data modeling, performance optimization, processing algorithms, etc.  i work on essentially a baby supercomputer (netezza) and have terabytes of various data.

i can run R inside the machine, and run some algos it has available inside it (geospatial, linear regression, k-means clustering) as well have SAS (EG) to connect to it - however i have no project or need of these tools.  the SAS userbase primarily actually uses SAS for ETL and straightforward reporting, very little if anything SAS/stats/model specific it seems.  although i have the tools, i don't have the use case or a project to learn.

my math brain has faded since college.  i don't mind spinning it up some more but i'm much more interested in being able to practically apply some things rather than really get deep and dirty in the math weeds.  if there's some fringe area where a phd in math can get a few percentage points lift more out of something, great - i'd like to pass what i build to them, not learn to be them.

although i can name the algos above, i don't know how/when to apply them, or tweak them, etc.  i'm dangerous in a database and naive on this type of analysis.  so my goal in the classes, or something else, would be to become dangerous on both.  if i go a schooling route, i'd like to do so online.  i would hope a program to be light on fluff and all on real examples and work to make me smarter, with enough balance on home life that it wouldn't be too burdensome to keep up with.

appreciate any thoughts on the matter.  thanks!

Since checks usage is declining these days (thanks to PayPal, Venmo and such) the data I have is pretty sparse. 
For a given month, only about a third of the bank's customers have at least 10 days of check withdrawals from their account (not always consecutive of course). Also, the number of check withdrawals can greatly vary across customers (i.e from 1-2/day/customer to 30-40/day/customer, depending for example on customers type, branch location).

My current algo is based only on univariate time series (no other data is available right now) and utilizies a plain ZScore. I'd like to think there's a different, better approach, given the sparsity of the data.

For example, if I own 10 shops and have a certain algorithm that I use to price items, and perhaps I want to test a new algorithm that would result in price changes. There are a few approaches I can see but it isn't clear to me if I'm missing others and would love to hear more.

**Standard A/B testing:**

If I were to randomly assign shoppers to test or control buckets then this would obviously be a bad experience for them (given that prices are visible).

**Switchback experiment:**

Perhaps instead I decide to run a switchback experiment, in which the control pricing algorithm runs for 6 hours, then the test pricing algorithm, runs for 6 hours, and so on throughout my test period. This is obviously better than the standard A/B approach but I feel like it still has problems (ie what if the price change results in a change to long term customer behavior but it takes some time for the behavior to change - perhaps the switchback wouldn't capture this).

**Causal Impact approach:**

Another approach might be to use a [Causal Impact](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html) style analysis, in which I set certain shops as 'control' shops, and other shops as 'test' shops, and then change the algorithm at the test shops and analyze my metric of interest, where we look for a causal effect in the time series at the test shops with respect to the control shops. The drawback here is that you seem highly dependent on how well the controls represent the test shops.

Hello,

I work for a small bank and want to throw a curve ball into our usual analysis of a particular loan book.

I have every data field you could want for when it comes to the loan book:

Date introduced

Date completed

Amount

Whether the loan repaid early

Whether the loan repaid late

Whether the loan was impaired

Property tenure (Freehold or Leasehold)

Borrower

Broker introducer

Broker fee %

Solicitor used

Term

LTV

Address


The data is too large and unruly for Excel, so my beginner self had hoped I could load this into a data frame and apply a few data science techniques to analyse and visualise this loan book. 

 I offer myself to the sub reddit for any insight or guidance into techniques or tips into how best identify meaniningful relationship with the data, and put them into pretty graphs so management can see them.

I plan to use Python/Pandas but any advice on libraries or specific functions or techniques most welcome.

I'm considering doing a conversion course in data science.

The investigatory and researching aspect of it all whets my appetite and data science jobs do tick a lot of boxes for me.

However, one thing I'm a bit concerned about is the presenting of the data. Quite frankly the thought of presentations fills me with anxiety. I've read that a large proportion of the job involves presenting your finders to groups of people with little to no knowledge of what you're talking about; that sounds awful to me haha. Furthermore, I'm not a great communicator and I'm a pretty shy, introverted guy.

My question is whether excellent communication and presentation skills are pretty much a must in this field of work? If so, would a career in computer science perhaps be better for somebody like me?

Although the class is taught using MATLAB the professor has given us the choice to use other rapid prototyping environments such as Python. My question is would it be better for me pursuing Data Science to learn how to do the problems in Python or should I just do it through MATLAB which overall would probably be easier since our textbook problems are based off using MATLAB? As of right now I would say I'm somewhere between novice and intermediate with Python since I did have a course last semester that we exclusively used Python for data analysis and visualization. From my understanding MATLAB is mostly used for academia and won't be very useful when I start applying for jobs or looking for internships this summer in the data science field.,10,7,False,self,,,,,

Unfortunately, I have hit a bit of a roadblock and am not sure where to go next.

Here is what I currently have going for me:

* Competent in: Java, MATLAB, Python (through Coursera courses), R, C.
* Am currently learning (this semester): Scheme, Haskell, Stata and SQL (through Stanford Lagunita).
* Completed one semester-long class project with R that implements ggplot2 and single-variable regression. 
* Will begin a second semester-long class project in R that introduces multivariate regression. 
* Will also begin a semester-long class project with Stata that is similar to those two described above.
* Coursework in: multivariate calculus, combinatorics, linear algebra and basic statistics.
* Currently enrolled in: declarative programming (Scheme, Haskell), numerical computing (MATLAB). 
* Strong with public speaking/communication (working on an advanced manual in my Toastmasters club and have even won speaking competitions in my city). 

I know it is not much, I still have miles to go and am not even qualified for an internship. After graduation, I plan to take an extra semester for the purpose of taking two courses at my university: *data mining techniques and big data*. 

In the meantime, what is the next step I should take to gain more experience/skills?

The official docs are pretty dense and don't have a lot of examples. There are 3 or 4 books on Amazon, but none of them are jumping out at me, and the best reviewed ones don't seem to cover spark 2. The best material I've found so far is the tutorials and starter notebooks on Databricks, but they don't go very far.

I've been considering a master's in DS, but I am seriously rethinking this option.  For one, big data education is one of the most searched terms in India; hence, it isn't a bubble that's exclusive to the U.S.  Having worked as a financial advisor (Merrill Lynch) in my previous job, I can't help but get nervous about Big Data in terms of the amount of fish in the small pond (a classic red ocean).  Many of these graduate degrees generally can be completed in a year for a full-time student--which means, the barrier to entry is quite low.  Also, when you look at MBA degrees, Analytics degrees, Data Science, Computer Science etc., many overlap in terms of concentration in big data...  

I think for those who do seek DS education, they should already be employed and have knowledge/skills within their respective industry.  For example, an RN deciding to get a DS grad degree or a network engineer in telecom deciding to do the same etc.  With such a high saturation and low barrier to entry, I really think these 1 year DS grad programs are cash cows for universities but for the grads, I think the realities once they graduate will be a lot different than what they were hoping for.  

Now an argument could be made on these points.  For example, I work for a large telco.  They are trying to be a ""data driven"" org. and when we pursue DS education, it doesn't mean that it will lead to a job in big data.  It just means that such education would help with being more analytical as a leader.  So I get this, and it falls in-line with the point I made above about already having industry knowledge and skills and DS education serving as additional skills set.    

The bottom line is to not be swayed by what everyone else is doing or what the media says is the ""sexy job"", because usually, by the time the good word gets to all of us it's usually too late and the cyclical trend is on the way down.  Based on what I look for--which are barrier to entry and whether it's a red/blue ocean, I would be cautious about anything in analytics especially for people who don't have their main industry skill set (such as those graduating from college without much work experience)...  Even if you work at Starbucks, whoa, it would be a great idea to go from barista to DS, but the questions is... how many DS'tists do Starbucks need?  And do they already have a bunch?",9,24,False,self,,,,,
