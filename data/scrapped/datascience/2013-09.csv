I've primarily used QlikView and Excel for my analysis. I've also, after hiring a team of developers, designed and built a data warehouse to accumulate data from around the company to transform and load into my dashboards and reports.

I not only develop the systems and dashboards themselves, but I perform the data analysis to help the business make strategic decisions on intellectual property concerns.

I've been in my current position for six years now, and I now manage a small team of developers and data analysts. I feel it's time for me to move on, so I've been starting the job hunt.

I have been seeing a lot of job openings for data scientists. Glancing at the job descriptions, it seems to fit pretty closely with what I do. I don't have a PhD in statistics, but I do have a B.S. in Comp Eng and an MBA. I am technical and also business savvy.

My question is, am I a data scientist? This is a new title, so I'm not sure exactly what it entails. I may have to beef up my statistics knowledge a bit, but it seems to me that the data scientist role is amorphous, and can lean more towards business or more towards math depending on the job.

What does a day in the life of a data scientist look like? If I were to interview for this position, what would the employer be looking for exactly?

I used to work for a chain of restaurants that sell ready to eat high quality foods to go (sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc.). They have six locations in a major North American city (mainly in the downtown core). The owner recently told me they have detailed sales data from every location from the last five years (they typically serve 1000+ people a day). They are not currently using the data. 

I was hoping for some input from more experienced individuals. Does this sound like a reasonable project to take on (unpaid (initially), no pressure)? I would want to analyze the data and hopefully provide meaningful information to support business decisions. I have brainstormed some potential questions that I could attempt to answer. For example: can I identify characteristics of a given location that result in higher sales? In this case I could use multivariable regression on a location's sales with variables like: months the location has been open, the presence of a government office within 400m, etc.

1. The Coursera lectures are more segmented.  Their videos are broken into 5-15 minute long individually labelled chunks, whereas the edX class shows two roughly 1 hour 15 minute long videos per week.
