To cut a long story short, I've had a bit of an existential crisis the past few weeks and have realised I'm not feeling very fulfilled at my current job.  Quite how this relates to data science will become obvious in a little bit, and thank you for your patience in reading this!

I currently am studying towards a CA qualification (CPA equivalent for you Americans) with a Big4 firm and will have that in a year.  Unfortunately, my job is the least interesting setting you could ever hope for (audit) and doesn't fill what I want to do - to help improve people's lives in some meaningful way, even if it's small. I actually considered going back and studying to become a doctor, but this would be a large amount of time wasted and even more time to become one, and isn't truly where my passion lies.

Instead, I've decided to focus on something that has been involved in my role for the past year or so.  I've moved into our data and analytics departments and have spent the last year delivering revenue analysis (interesting! fun! no) through use of Alteryx.  I love the whole process of analysis, from data gathering right through to visualisation.  Unfortunately the role is very much designed as a ""no coding necessary"" role, and this means I would suffer transitioning into any other role.

I'm very much interested in the healthcare industry and the applications data science has in it, and I've had thoughts to go back to do an MSc in Health Data Analytics with Machine Learning to do this.  I have two questions from this;  is there demand for an accountant - data scientist, and what would be my best ""next steps""?  I'm going to start learning Python, R and SQL, as these are the ones more senior people in my role tend to work with, but I'm interested to hear r/datascience's opinion!

tl;dr:  accountant want be data scientist and promote positive change in healthcare industry, what do?

My question is, with all of this stuff that a DS do, where should I begin, should I start with math concepts like linear regression? I remember studying about them, but don't remember how to use it. Same for statistics, I had classes about it in college, but don't remember a lot. Or maybe learn more about machine learning algorithms? Or start learning Python/R since I already have some knowledge in programming?

I'm inclined to start with math/statistics since it is the field I know less about and seems to be the more important to this field, but I maybe wrong about it. Also, I have a database of 4 cinemas (same company) with data from all the sales of tickets and popcorn, movies, etc, and I'm thinking about using the data it has to practice the concepts.

As the title suggests I'm stuck with my thesis. I'm reaching out to you guys as a ditch last effort, as I'm stuck and without good resources to help me.

I have a dataset of products in record order. E.G:



Comany | Product_level1 | product_leveln | Date
------|--------------|--------------|----
A | prod 1 | prod 1.2 | 11/11/11
A | prod 1 | prod 1.4 | 12/11/11
A | prod 1 | prod 1.2 | 12/11/11
B | prod 1 | prod 1.1 | 12/11/11
B | prod 3 | prod 3.1 | 12/11/11

My goal is to come up with a solution that recommends the next product by using two different sources of data. I've scraped vacancies and news articles and ran LDA on them. I now have a dataset with (some of the companies) a count per topic. 

Two approaches I've tried so far:

**Memory based recommendation system**

I turned the order data into a binary matrix E.g:


Company | prod1 | prod2 | prod3
-------|-----|-----|-----
A | 0 | 1 | 0
B | 0 | 1 | 1
 
Here I essentially treated the having a product as a rating of 1, not having a product as 0. I did this for the highest level of granularity to avoid (even) high(er) dimensionality. The reason I did this is because I was told to use collaborative filtering, and this is the only way I could get it to work. I then created a user-item recommender system.

Then to see if the vacancies/news articles helped I clustered the companies based on how often each company posted something per topic. E.g.:



company | topic 1 | topic 2
-------|-------|-------
A | 2 | 6
B | 0 | 1
 
This lead to no clear clusters (unsurprisingly). Furthermore I was not able to create a good accuracy measure for this ""model"". I then ditched this approach and tried something else.

**Random Forest**

I then approached it as a classification problem. I run a random forest taking each product as independent variable with all others as dependent. I do this for all products. I then aggregate and average the F1, recall and precision. Accuracy is useless since I have a very imbalanced dataset (usually 0.9 0s to 0.1 1s).

Then I added a binary column (did have/did not have vacancy) and ran the models for products again. This improved the F1 etc somewhat. 

I've gotten feedback that I should account for the time difference in the placement of vacancies and the orders. I would tacitly assume that having a vacancy now is related to a product the client bought a few years ago.

I don't see how this is an issue. To my understanding the models will look at a product mix plus vacancy status, and then see whether or not the independent product(/variable) would be of interest or not.

And this is where I am now. I was hoping someone could help me as I really don't know what to do anymore, and time is running out quickly. I am willing to share more details, but preferably not here as I would like to retain some anonymity.

Lastly, I hope this is somewhat coherent, if not I will edit unclear parts.

Thanks in advance.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Throwaway account for privacy/because I'm paranoid.

&amp;#x200B;

So the quick and dirty background on me:

Graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in May 2016. Before my current job I interned doing more classic MechE roles, most recently as a Body Engineering intern at General Motors. I wanted something which involved more quantitative problem solving, programming, data analysis, etc.. So I looked beyond typical MechE jobs. 

Now I am a trader/analyst at a pretty well regarded proprietary trading firm (think hedge fund, but without external investors). For those who are acquainted with the space, think along the lines of Jane Street, Optiver, Akuna, Jump, etc.. A bit less well known and exclusive than those names (especially JSC), but same idea. The interview/weedout process for these types of companies is fairly similar in that they are heavy in brainteasers, mental math, etc.. But require relatively little prior sector knowledge or particular background/experience. Compensation is high (expected all-in $140-170k this year, in HCOL area but not NYC/SF expensive), but I am starting to lose interest/motivation. I feel that I've learned most of the technical skills I can in this role/company, so I'd rather continue learning more skills elsewhere and/or work at a company/field which I would be more interested in.

At my job I do a lot of data analysis in R, make use large SQL database, etc.. In addition to just doing data analysis I develop and improve strategies, identify investing hypotheses, clean/validate backtesting data, write/maintain production code, and present to higher ups (those with their skin in the game, capital in the fund) for approval with relevant data viz. Technical complexity usually doesn't go beyond linear/convex optimization. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I feel relatively qualified for data/business analyst roles (use SQL, data analysis, data visualization, present to management), but I'm not sure I tick all the boxes for full blown data scientist roles. Mainly I currently don't really do much in terms of proving statistical significance (weird, I know, but I trade a very niche type of derivative, and statistical significance rarely matters as outcomes are relatively discrete and sample sizes often are very small). Heck, I rarely even need to create linear regressions. Generally something far simpler is enough to identify and use pricing signals (think comparing the average cashflow given that a discrete pricing signal is either true or false). Furthermore, more in-depth stats (p-values, statistical hypothesis testing) stuff is completely alien to me (I am familiar from some intro stats classes in college, but haven't used at all for job). Don't even get me started on machine learning, completely outside the scope of my job. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

* Do I qualify for any data scientist jobs right now? To be honest it'd be hard to swallow taking a huge paycut (like 50% paycut) to become a business/data analyst. I understand that leaving finance will likely result in some paycut though. 
* If not what should I learn to have the skill set that is desired for these data scientist positions? How long would it take to learn these skills? Where should I go to self-learn these skills (Kaggle, Brilliant, LeetCode, etc.)?
* Is it worth considering  one of those programming/data bootcamps or even getting a full master's degree? Will that make me a much stronger job applicant than self-learning the material?
* Is R sufficient or should I also focus on (re)learning Python? 

Thanks for bearing with me, I know it was a wall of text!

TL;DR - We have been working on a data versioning solution and looking for your feedback.

Longer version:

As good developers we strive to use version control as we develop ML models to keep our revisions straight.  This guarantees reproducibility and makes it easy to switch back and forth between experiments.

However, we found out that keeping the data source versioned might not be so easy. While, there are a few solutions on the market, they require us to manually update the data streams as they change or to use a custom development environment. 

During our work we developed an internal tool for data versioning, which we would like to spin out as a standalone product and would love to get your feedback on this.

Our solution would be easily integrated into your notebook/ environment. From that point onwards, no integration is required as the data is saved whenever the code is run.

The main features for the product:
* Simply integrated and automatic versioning of both code and data
* Visual interface to see if data and/or code has changed per each point in time
* Caching of notebook outputs
* Deep linking of whole notebooks or notebook blocks (per point in time) to allow for easy sharing 

So what do you think? Would you use something like that? Miss something? Hate something?

Thanks ahead.

The company dates back to the late 1800s-early 1900s and the average tenure is over 15 years so, it is so slow to change and largely run by, what I call, ""intestinal analytics."" I can't really afford to leave right now because I made the mistake of living at my means and I have plenty of debt to pay down before I can move, maybe a year and a half longer before I can't afford a pay cut without dramatically decreasing my standard or living, which takes a bit of time to liquidate assets. 

&amp;#x200B;

They hired our entire team over the course of one year. We are a team of 12 and I am one of 6 Data Scientists. I was initially hired due to my abilities in R. I did some of the advanced modeling work for a while, which I enjoyed. After a few months, the higher ups decided to purchase tableau. I was the only one of the team with prior tableau experience so, I got moved over to tableau world. At first, that was fine because I had to refresh my memory and relearn a lot of things as well as train another team member. Now, it's tedious and boring. So, now, it's me and a coworker who live in tableau world. The bad part is less the boringness and more so the fact that we are responsible for facing the company and building something presentable out of the modeling work that others can understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the models show that the company is losing ground in comparison to competitors, which, for some reason, we get yelled at over, because ""the modeling can't be correct."" It is. They just don't like it. Keep in mind, the profit margin for this company is over 60% so, it's a bunch a spoiled old people who throw temper tantrums when they hear things they don't like. Another thing is that when we do roll out a very useful tool or valuable information, that's appreciated for about 15 seconds, then we get bombarded with requests to change colors to different colors based upon the person and no one is happy because they don't have their own individual view. 

&amp;#x200B;

The culture attitude towards my one coworker and I has also been on a steady decline since the company decided on a ""salary transparency policy"" about a month ago. During a reorg, I got a 25k increase, that I thought everyone else got. Apparently that isn't the case. Only my cowroker who also works primarily with Tableau did as well. Once that got out, she and I have faced a steady stream of judgement because we are making more money to do what is seen as easier. HR issued a statement saying that we got the increase due to the business facing nature and value tableau reports are adding to the company. Either way, it has been uncomfortable, especially when we need their help on something and since we are the youngest on the team. 

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker who works with me on tableau lives the next street over so we carpool a lot and she spends most of her commute home crying about how much she hates her job. I don't cry, but sometimes I really want to. We are both at the point where the money just isn't worth being totally miserable to 40 hours a week.

**Data science is an amalgamation of three different fields namely**

1. **Computer Science**
2. **Mathematics**
3. **Business Knowledge**

 Examples where mathematics play a role in data science

1. Finding immediate insights out of data  
We use descriptive statistics here to gather immediate information about the data at hand. For example, in a house price dataset, we can find out the in Region X has the most number of expensive houses.
2. Inferencing from data and validating it  
We use inferential statistics to infer about our findings from data. On finding maximum house price at a region X, we formulate some hypothesis on why prices are higher in that region. After forming hypotheses, we check their validity using hypothesis tests
3. Making predictions from data  
Machine learning and math is one of the greatest love stories. These algorithms are a mix of logic and a lot of maths. Hence understanding the math behind may result in you appreciating it furthermore.

 

If youve just entered the word of Data Science, you might have come across people stating Math as a prerequisite to Data Science. In all honesty, its not Maths, rather Statistics thats a major prerequisite for Data Science.

Well, statistics is something which is present everywhere in the data science field. Hence, you surely can not be a good data scientist without knowing and understanding statistics well enough. But, Dimensionless has come up with the great courses which talk about the in-depth understanding of statistics and their applications.

These days, libraries like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) hide almost all the complex Mathematics away from the user. Good for us, but its still good to have a basic understanding of the underlying principles on which these things work because having a general understanding of basic statistics for Data Science can help you utilize these libraries better.

## Types of Statistics

 

## Descriptive Statistic

First of all, doing a descriptive statistical analysis of your dataset is absolutely crucial. A lot of people skip this part and therefore lose a lot of valuable insights about their data, which often leads to wrong conclusions. Take your time and carefully run descriptive statistics and finally make sure that the data meets the requirements to do further analysis.

We use descriptive statistics for data exploration because it provides simple summaries of the dataset. Together with graphics analysis, this is the first step in every data analysis.

### A small peek of what we have in the course by understanding about central tendency

In statistics, we have to deal with the mean, mode, and the median. These are also called the Central Tendency. These are just three different kinds of averages and certainly the most popular ones.

The mean is simply the average and considered the most reliable measure of central tendency for making assumptions about a population from a single sample. Central tendency determines the tendency for the values of your data to cluster around its mean, mode, or median. We calculate median by the sum of all values, divided by the number of values.

The mode is the value or category that occurs most often within the data. Therefore a dataset has no mode, if no number is repeated or if no category is the same. The mode is also the only measure of central tendency that can be used for categorical variables since you cant compute for example the average for the variable gender. You simply report categorical variables as numbers and percentages.

The median is the middle value or midpoint in your data. Note that outliers affect do not affect median much as compared to mean. Let us take an example here: Imagine you have a dataset of housing prizes that range mostly from Rs 10,00,000 to Rs 70,00,000 but contains a few houses that are worth more than 70 lakhs. These expensive houses will heavily effect then mean since it is the sum of all values, divided by the number of values. The outliers will not affect the median much since it is only the middle value of all data points. Therefore the median is a much more suited statistic, to report about your data.

This is just a small peek of what you will be learning in descriptive stats. All the topics are taught in the order which well help learner form mind maps of different concept connected to each other and have a strong grasp over them.

The course content includes ([link](https://dimensionless.in/data-science-using-r-python/))

* Intro to Research Methods
* Visualizing Data
* Central Tendency
* Variability
* Standardizing
* Normal Distribution
* Sampling Distributions

 

https://i.redd.it/5n0bg7c7jsp11.jpg

With inferential statistics, you are trying to reach conclusions that extend beyond the immediate data alone. For instance, we use inferential statistics to try to infer from the sample data what the population might think. Or, we use inferential statistics to make judgments of the probability that an observed difference between groups is a dependable one or one that might have happened by chance in this study. Thus, we use inferential statistics to make inferences from our data to more general conditions; we use descriptive statistics simply to describe whats going on in our data.

Inferential Statistics contents include ([link](https://dimensionless.in/data-science-using-r-python/))

* Estimation (Point estimate and Interval estimate)
* Hypothesis Testing
* t-tests (One Sample, Two Sample Dependent, Two-sample Independent)
* ANOVA
* Correlation
* Regression
* Chi-square Test

Apart from probability and statistics, Our courses include an in-depth explanation of machine learning algorithms by going deeper into the math. There has been a lot of booms lately in the field of machine learning and deep learning. With our up-to-date courses, we give you the essence of maths required to understand machine learning in great detail. We have covered topics like linear algebra, regression and the math behind different machine learnings algorithms exhaustively.

Then I came here. I implemented a LSTM neural network in Pytorch. It worked but I want to know if it worked the way I guessed how it worked.

Say there's a 2-layer LSTM network with 10 units in each layer.
The inputs are a sequence data Xt1, Xt2, Xt3, Xt4, Xt5.

So when the inputs are entered into the network, Xt1 will be thrown into the network first and be connected to every unit in the first layer. And it will generate 10 hidden states/10 memory cell values/10 outputs. Then the 10 hidden states, 10 memory cell values and Xt2 will be connected to the 10 units again, and generate another 10 hidden states/10 memory cell values/10 outputs and so on.

After all 5 Xt's are entered into the network, the 10 outputs from Xt5 from the first layer are then used as the inputs for the second layer. The other outputs from Xt1 to Xt4 are not used. And the the 10 outputs will be entered into the second layer one by one again. So the first from the 10 will be connected to every unit in the second layer and generate 10 hidden states/10 memory cell values/10 outputs. The 10 memory cell values/10 hidden states and the second value from the 10 will be connected and so forth?

After all these are done, only the final 10 outputs from the layer 2 will be used. Is this how the LSTM network works? Thanks!

Short Intro:
After getting my PhD (physics), I have been going back and forth between possible Industry and Academic job options. Launching a career in Data Science seems like a prosperous option. 

I will go right ahead and admit that although I have some idea what Data Science is, I am quite inexperienced and I will be attending a bootcamp. The issue is that we are required to come up with a data science project,  I have found myself to be surprisingly stumped in coming up with an idea. I have never done something like this before, and I am inexperienced with the tools and methods used in data science, or cannot fully comprehend as of yet how all these tools and methods come together along with a dataset to become a data project.

When thinking of a project, there are the questions of the availability of the data, size of the data, parameters of the data, and, most importantly, the feasibility of project itself.

I am not trying to fish for easy ideas, that is not my intention, I am trying to understand what I can do? I would greatly appreciate some assistance in the form of pointers so that I can exercise on this, how shall I say, creative process of designing a project for myself.

I have found this to require a highly different sort of ""thinking"" compared with my research at the lab. Maybe they are similar, but since I know my research and field well, designing a research comes naturally to me, after-all, I have spent many years on this training. ",12,1,False,self,,,,,

I started working for a boutique consulting firm for two years directly after graduate school. We do some interesting work in supply chain analytics and customer service analytics related to the automotive/heavy equipment industries. My main responsibility was building statistical solutions for the client. Secondary responsibilities was helping the development team put solutions into production and communicate findings/process to the client.

&amp;#x200B;

*Why I want to leave?*

* The hours / travel is interfering with my personal life in negative ways.
* The lead data scientist recently left to a senior role in a company with a well-known data science department. Firm leadership isn't taking advice from developers / data scientists regarding the feasibility of project proposals. I believe this is why our lead data scientist left.

*What skills I learned from this position*

* Gained experience working with very messy data
* Learned how to take very abstract asks (*e.g*. Improve x KPI) and design a concrete and structured solution
* Worked on many classification and constrained optimization problems
* Spent a lot of time successfully persuading people not to make naive decisions based on observational data. 
* Learned some software development best practices from our in-house developers.
* I learned how to gain buy-in from management and clients. This translates to communicating data science solutions in the language of the business, understanding that getting buy-in is a pull not a push, and  asking the right questions to understand best ways to show ROI.

&amp;#x200B;

*What I'm missing from this position*

* Firm values soft skills greater than technical skills. Hard to get budget for training / technical development.
* The nature of consulting work prefers someone who is a ""jack of all trades"" data scientist. I'm gaining a lot breadth of technical knowledge. Not a lot of depth.
* I spend a lot of time telling clients not to do idiotic things. I worked with a client that would constantly change data to get the results he wants out of the inventory planning system he was using. I feel like I'm wasting my time and potential when on projects with these clients.

*Questions to the subreddit*

My key questions are:

* Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation? What us your new ex-consulting position? 
* Was your consulting background a negative when looking for a different data science role?
* Are there meaningful data science adjacent roles that someone from my background could be a good fit in?

&amp;#x200B;

The  volume of data is growing and the pace of this growth is stimulating  rigorously. Thanks to this digital transformation era, log files, sensor  data etc. have dramatically evolved with giving ways to futuristic  sources. Data science is capable of bringing in mammoth-sized data along  with velocity which far transcends the stereotypical data warehousing  accesses. Progressive enterprises like Athena are leveraging these  advanced sources in innovative ways to obtain unprecedented value and  competitive advantage. In this post, we are going to list the top 8 data  science use cases that are disrupting various industries. ***Do have a read!***

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 8 Data Science Use Cases: Big Data Applied the Most](https://i.redd.it/i6zyvuul55q11.png)

### 1. Big data predicting the best retail location

This is one of the most successful data science use cases. Data  analytics has proved to be a powerful meddling force in the industry.  Retail brands of all sizes, which represent assorted trade orbs, seek to  leverage the potential value of data.

One of the major reasons behind the success of any business is its  location. You can always compare two restaurants  one located in the  center of a bustling marketplace and the other tucked away in a remote  spot of the same location. For some reason, the one tucked inside can  never surpass the one located at the heart of the market.

Data science effortlessly addresses those two vital questions 

1. How to determine features that are important to a particular retail business?
2. How to estimate retail sales performance given a new location?

The data sets include information about feature location, population  count, property type, education status, and monthly sales from various  branches and help retailers in determining which address will best work  for their businesses.

### 2. Data science predicting prognosis and diagnostic accuracy and various other medical aspects

Just as augmented reality transforming the healthcare industry, data  science has helped medical sector to make a quantum leap. Right from  computerizing medical data, medical image analysis, research in genetics  and genomics to the discovery of drugs and genetic disease exploration   big data has got them covered.

&amp;#x200B;

Data science use cases are the most successful among all other  industry spectra. Big data techniques are used to determine the astute  difference in modality, resolution, and dimension of the medical images.  Many more approaches are being developed to enhance the image quality,  extract data from images, and deliver the most detailed interpretation.  The deep-learning-based algorithms add to the diagnostic accuracy by  analyzing previous examples and then suggesting better treatment  solutions.

### 3. Data analysis detecting fraud, price optimization, customer segmentation and many more

[Since  the insurance industry runs on predicting future events and estimating  the risk/value of these events; the 4 Vs (volume, velocity, veracity,  and variety) of huge datasets have become an integral tool for insurers.  ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/top-8-data-science-use-cases-big-data-applied-the-most/&amp;text=Since%20the%20insurance%20industry%20runs%20on%20predicting%20future%20events%20and%20estimating%20the%20risk%2Fvalue%20of%20these%20events%3B%20the%204%20Vs%20%28volume%2C%20velocity%2C%20veracity%2C%20and%20variety%29%20of%20huge%20datasets%20have%20become%20an%20integral%20tool%20for%20insurers.&amp;related)[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/top-8-data-science-use-cases-big-data-applied-the-most/&amp;text=Since%20the%20insurance%20industry%20runs%20on%20predicting%20future%20events%20and%20estimating%20the%20risk%2Fvalue%20of%20these%20events%3B%20the%204%20Vs%20%28volume%2C%20velocity%2C%20veracity%2C%20and%20variety%29%20of%20huge%20datasets%20have%20become%20an%20integral%20tool%20for%20insurers.&amp;related) 

&amp;#x200B;

Data science service providers are consistently enhancing data  sources such as log files, telematics, sensor data, customer  interactions, and social media so as to disrupt the healthcare industry.  Big data has now become more engaging across diverse areas of the  medical industry.

Insurance fraud has been a major concern as it causes millions of  losses to the insurance companies every year. One of the major aspects  of data science use cases in insurance is detecting fraud. This helps  pinpoint more claims that should be researched by human auditors.  Machine learning doesnt only reduce the costs of human hours; it also  helps in reclaiming the robbed money from fraudulent claims.

### 4. Data analytics predicting product requirements and their costs live as customers enter the store

Brick and mortar stores are the best examples of data science use  cases in retail. Machine learning can calibrate the best price to  persuade a customer in buying the particular product whilst maximizing  profits. Just as the old school way, salesman judges a customer from his  dressing and offers him the price, in the same way, data analytics  determines the factors and predicts.

### 5. Data science predicting fundraising

&amp;#x200B;

Big data is certainly a fundraisers secret weapon. While  philanthropists are always eager to donate money, they are also equally  concerned if at all their funding is being put to good use. Those  questions haunt almost every fundraiser 

* How much do I really know about my donors relationship with my charity?
* Am I using the data I have to its fullest advantage?
* Should I be doing more?

&gt;*The emergence of new technology alone has led to  increases in donor expectations on several frontsfrom mission  transparency and program reporting to organization access and donor  responsiveness.*

***4 major advantages of data science use cases in fundraising *** 

1. Data quantifies and supervises the performance of the individual managing fundraising program
2. Data creates connects and explains how the fundraising stacks up to peer programs
3. Data determines and adjusts the donor experience to enhance loyalty and retention
4. Data helps in predicting the missionthrough outcomes and impact

### 6. Data science acts as virtual assistance for patients and customer support

&amp;#x200B;

The AI-powered mobile apps can provide basic healthcare support,  usually as chatbots. These smart apps remind the users to take their  medicine on time, and if required, they also assign an appointment with a  doctor.

The machine learning algorithms use NLP (natural language processing)  and generation to collect accurate information, create a complex report  of the users condition, and provide a personalized experience.

### 7. Data science optimizing business processes

&amp;#x200B;

Another major aspect of data science use cases is in the enterprise  sector. Big data is increasingly leveraged to optimize business  processes. Based on the predictions from web search trends, social media  data, and other forecasts, enterprises are now able to augment their  stocks.

Supply chain is one of the particular verticals where data analytics  is being rigorously integrated. Geographic locationing and radio  frequency identification sensors are used to track the delivery vehicles  and optimize routes by integrating live traffic data, etc.

### 8. Big data optimizing machine performance

Big data analytics help in transforming machines and making them  smarter and more autonomous. For instance, Google use big data to  operate their self-driving cars. Toyota Prius is fitted with cameras,  GPS and powerful sensors to enable drivers to safely drive with no room  for errors.

### Call to action

&amp;#x200B;

For us, the 8 data science use cases we have listed here represent  the areas in which big data is applied the most. There are indeed  numerous other applications of big data. There will be also many new  spheres as the data analytics tools become more widespread.

While data science has unprecedented potential, its imperative for  enterprises to ask the right questions.

Most of the literature we find on machine learning talks about two types of learning techniques  supervised and unsupervised. **Supervised learning** is where we have a labeled dataset. This means we already have data from which to develop models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and others. With this model, we can make further predictions like given data on housing prices, what will the cost of a house with a given set of features be. **Unsupervised learning**, on the other hand, doesnt have a labeled dataset, but still, we do have abundant data. The model we create in this setting just needs to derive a pattern amongst the data available. We do this with algorithms such as K Means Clustering, K Nearest Neighbors, etc. to solve problems like grouping a set of users according to their behavior in an online shopping portal. But what if we dont have so much of data? What if we are dealing with a dynamic environment and the model needs to gather data and learn in real time? Enters **reinforcement learning**. In this article, we look at the basics of what [reinforcement learning](https://dimensionless.in/deep-learning/) is, how it works and some of its practical applications.

### Reinforcement Learning through Super Mario

We all have experienced reinforcement learning, quite possibly very early in our lives. We just didnt know it by its name. Okay, so weve all played Super Mario when we were younger right? Just in case you didnt or have forgotten, this is how it looked like:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](h4t5lpe4l5q11)

You might not be able to totally recall the first time you ever played Mario, but just like any other game, you might have started with a clean slate, not knowing what to do. You see an **environment** in which you as Mario, the **agent**, have been placed that consists of bricks, coins, mystery boxes, pipes, sentient mushrooms called Goomba, and other elements. You begin taking **actions** in this environment by pressing a few keys before you realized then you can move Mario with the arrow keys to the left and right. Every action you take changes the **state** of Mario. You moved to the extreme left at the beginning but nothing happened so you started moving right. You tried jumping onto the mystery box after which you got a **reward** in the form of coins. Now, you learned that every time you see a mystery box, you can jump and earn coins. You continued moving right and then you collided with a Goomba after which you got a **negative reward** (also called a punishment) in the form of death. You could start all over again, but by now youve learned that you must not get too close to the Goomba; you should try something else. In other words, you have been reinforced. Next, you try to jump and go over the Goomba using the bricks but then youd miss a reward from the mystery box. So you need to formulate a new **policy**, one thatll give you the maximum benefit  gives you the reward and doesnt get you killed. So you wait for the perfect moment to go under the bricks and jump over the Goomba. After many attempts, you take one such action that causes Mario to step over the Goomba and it gets killed. And then you have an Aha moment; youve learned how to kill the threat and now you can also get your reward. You jump and this time, its not a coin, its a mushroom. You again go over the bricks and eat the mushroom. You get an even bigger reward; Marios stronger now. This is the whole idea of reinforcement learning. It is a goal-oriented algorithm, which learns techniques to maximize the chances of attaining the goal over many iterations. Using trial and error, reinforcement learning learns much like how humans do.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](u95xn5b5l5q11)

### Comparison with other Machine Learning Techniques

There are a few differences in RL as compared to other machine learning techniques. These include:

1. There is **no supervisor** to tell you if you did right or wrong. If you did well, you get a reward, else you would not. If you did terrible, you might even get a negative reward.
2. Reinforcement learning adds in another dimension  time. It can be thought of being **in between supervised and unsupervised learning**. Whereas in supervised learning, we have labeled data and unsupervised learning we dont, in reinforcement learning, we have time delayed labels, which we call rewards.
3. RL has the concept of **delayed rewards**. So, the reward we just received may not be dependent on the last action we took. It is entirely possible that the reward came because of something we did 20 iterations ago. As you move through Super Mario, youll find instances where you hit a mystery box and keep moving forward and the mushroom also moves and finds you. It is the series of actions that started with Mario hitting the mystery box that resulted in him getting stronger after a certain time delay.
4. The **choice we make now affects the set of choices we have in the future**. If we choose a different set of actions, we will be in a completely different state and the inputs to that state and where we can go from there differs. If Mario hit the mystery box but chose not to move forward when the mushroom began to move, hell miss the mushroom and he wont get stronger. The agent is now in a different state than he would have been had he moved forward.

Doesnt RL feel like life in general?

### AlphaGo

&amp;#x200B;

![img](cnry5h26l5q11)

Reinforcement learning broke into the scene in March 2016 when DeepMinds **AlphaGo**, trained using RL, [defeated 18-time world champion Go player Lee Sedol 4-1](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/15/googles-alphago-seals-4-1-victory-over-grandmaster-lee-sedol). It turns out the game of Go was really hard to master for the machine, more so than games like Chess simply because there are just too many possible moves and too many numbers of states the game can be in. But how did AlphaGo beat the world champion?

Just like Mario, AlphaGo learned through trial and error, over many iterations. AlphaGo doesnt know the best strategy, but it knows whether it won or lost. AlphaGo uses a tree search to check every possible move it can make and see which is better. On a 1919 Go board, there are 361 possible moves. For each of these 361 moves, there are 359 possible second moves and so on. In all, there are about 4.6710\^385 possible moves; thats way too much. Even with its advanced hardware, AlphaGo cannot try every single move there is. So, it uses another kind of tree search called the **Monte Carlo Tree Search**. In this search, only those moves that are most promising are tried out. Each time AlphaGo finishes a game, it updates the record of how many games each move won. After multiple iterations, AlphaGo has a rough idea of which moves maximizes its chance of winning.

AlphaGo first trained itself by imitating historic games played between real players. After this, it started playing against itself and after many iterations, it learned the best moves to win a Go match. Before playing against Lee Sedol, AlphaGo played against and defeated professional Go player Fan Hui 5-0 in 2015. At that moment, people didnt consider it a big deal as AlphaGo hadnt reached world champion level. But what they didnt realize was AlphaGo was learning from humans while beating them. So by the time AlphaGo played against Lee Sedol, it had surpassed world champion level. AlphaGo played 60 online matches against top players and world champions and it won all 60. AlphaGo retired in 2017 while DeepMind continues AI research in other areas.

### Applications

Its all fun and games, but where can RL be actually useful? What are some of the real world application? Well see some of these below:

* **Robotics and Manufacturing**

One of the largest field of research and now beginning to show real promise is the field of Robotics. Teaching a robot to act similar to humans has been a major research area and also part of several sci-fi movies. With reinforcement learning, robots can learn similar to how humans do. Using this, industrial automation has been simplified. An example is Teslas factory that consists of more than 160 robots that do a large part of the work on cars to reduce the risk of defects.

* **Inventory Management**

RL can be used to reduce transit time for stocking and retrieving products in the warehouse for optimizing space utilization and warehouse operations.

* **Power Systems And Energy Consumption**

RL and optimization techniques can be utilized to assess the security of electric power systems and to enhance Microgrid performance. Adaptive learning methods are employed to develop control and protection schemes, which can effectively help to reduce transmission losses and CO2 emissions. Also, Google has used DeepMinds RL technologies to significantly reduce the energy consumption in its own data centers.

* **Text, Speech and Dialog Systems**

AI researches at SalesForce used deep RL for automatically generating summaries from text based on content abstracted from some original text document. This demonstrated an approach for text mining solution for companies to unlock unstructured text. RL is also being used to allow dialog systems (chatbots) to learn from user interactions and help them improve over time.

* **Finance**

Pit.AI used RL for evaluating trading strategies. RL has immense applications in the stock market. Q-Learning algorithm can be used by anyone to potentially gain income without worrying about market price or risks involved. The algorithm is smart enough to take all these under considerations while making a trade.

* [Data Science](https://dimensionless.in) **and Machine Learning**

A lot of machine learning libraries have been made available in recent times to help data scientists, but choosing a proper model or architecture can still be challenging. Several research groups have proposed using RL to simplify the process of designing neural network architectures. AutoML from Google uses RL to produce state-of-the-art machine-generated neural network architectures for language modeling and computer vision.

Some people believe AI will stop the climate change and save the planet. Others say it is bigger evil than terrorism or virulent diseases and can one day become the Red Queen of our reality.

The reason for this fear is that an average person associates AI with the human brain. But the essence of AI is not about copying human functions, but making our life easier. 

AI is designed to automate processes, that people perform slowly and ineffectively. A human cant stay awake for 24 hours and answer clients, while chatbots can. A human cant calculate budget of thousands of companies, while machines do it easily. Humans take much more time to analyze hundreds of articles to trace some tendency than computers would do it.

Above all, it is much cheaper and more reasonable to have AI doing the no-brain job and let people engage in more creative activities. That is why many managers, businesspeople, scientists and so on seek Artificial Intelligence assistance and will continue to seek.

We are witnessing only the emergence of AI, and the speed it is being adopted at doesnt seem to slow down, which makes us believe in its bright future. And you?

The workflow for me is usually loading up the data, parsing json, cleaning, working though each column to visualize it and see how it behaves, encode/normalize, then capture everything in a class so I can apply to test/production data.  


Then I start experimenting with different algorithms and getting  feel for what works and what doesn't until I am satisfied with my test/cross-val performance and I do a little analysis on how the algorithm works and what features are important. Most of this process is quite monotonous and I wish I could make it go faster. Part of it is just getting better at programming so I waste less time taking care of exceptions/looking up stuff on StackOverflow, but I am sure there's also some tips from seasoned professionals on how to work faster.

I have been lurking this sub a bit and understand that there are two types of people in the data science field: those who are highly trained, educated and passionate about advanced math, stats, computer science etc. and how to apply them to this emerging science, and those who simply learned Python, Tableau and SQL online/on their own and end up applying for jobs they may not be cut out for. I understand there is a bit of animosity between ""real"" data scientists and SQL monkeys, so I am coming at this from an outside and honest perspective--I want to be the latter, not pass off as more than I am, and simply earn more than my field of study would have paid me while doing a good enough job and working hard. I don't want to try to take a job from someone else, I don't want to crowd up the scene. I just know there is a demand for people in this field in a variety of roles. Give me your grunt work--how can I get the skills to do it?  


I finished up a degree from a well-known public school in Environmental Science in 2012 and have held a few pretty decent jobs here and there, unfortunately my degree was pretty broad and difficult to spin into anything more than a few bucks over minimum wage. I live in a high cost of living area (SF Bay Area) and would move elsewhere but my wife has a job she loves and family to take care of here.   


I want to do something less specialized, requiring less skill in data science for purely practical reasons. Demand is high, pay is high and it is less mainstream than software engineering. I have taken single variable calculus, multivariable calc, stats 1 and the physics series (all for engineers) I know that is not much at all, but again I am not looking to be the expert on a team.   


What is the best role for someone like me (would analyst fit the bill) and lastly, what is the best way I can go about this?

What I need is more challenging problems that force me to really think about how the language works and how I can use the tools I have in new ways.

1) Exercises made by someone else. Do you guys have any good resources for this? Preferably free, but also paid if it's worth it. For example, I found http://sqlzoo.net/

2) Come up with my own problem. I don't mean something like ""let's practice Inner joins"", but something more akin to an assignment in college.

At the same time, it shouldn't be something where I already know how to do everything and it's just a matter of looking up the right functions. I guess the main thing I'm asking for here is inspiration - I'm certain some of you guys have your own little projects that you do in your free time and maybe if you mention some of those I can think of my own stuff to do.

I've been cleaning and transforming data sets for a while and was tired of how long and frustrating the data prep process is -- so Im are trying to break through these bottlenecks.

I setup a experienced team of data engineers with backgrouds in applied mathematics, engineering and nuclear physics to help businesses clean and transform volumes of data.

The idea behind is not to replace a professional data scientist, but just offload the tedious work, and let them focus on the larger strategic business tasks like ML and data visualisation.

Heres how it works:

1. Submit your data cleaning or wrangling task
2. Our team gets to work
3. We do any revisions if necessary
4. Repeat

My decision is also supported by the fact that I can switch back to people management at any time in the future. This move would only be lateral, with no pay-cuts or level changes.

Through this job hunting process, I've started noticing this trend of the title being used to cover every job from a Data/BI Engineer, to a reporting analyst, to a business analyst, to an ML scientist. This is true not just at my current company, but across the tech industry in general.

I was talking to a friend of mine at Amazon and it looks like they've figured this out with 5 titles:

* **Applied Scientist** - you have to pass the bar for statistics, machine learning algorithms, and an entry level software development engineer

* **Research Scientist** - you have to pass the bar for statistics and ML algorithms

* **Data Scientist** - you have to pass the bar for statistics and basic ML

* **Business Analyst** - you have to pass the bar for statistics and business case studies

* **Data Engineer** - you are essentially a software engineer that builds data pipelines

I really like how they have clearly defined competencies and job expectations.

Another annoyance I have with these job postings I'm reading is that the requirements don't match the job profile. There are roles that are reporting heavy, but require you to be an expert in deep-learning. 

For external candidates, this creates a skewed perception of what the job profile will be, they end up joining the team and getting bored of what they are asked to do.

I guess the point of my long rant is this:

* **If you are a hiring manager, please write job descriptions that more or less accurately reflect the role** - I take this very seriously, but I don't see the same rigor among other hiring managers.

I am working on a dataset from kaggle and there is a kernel written in R which i can somewhat refer to. Now in this kernel,they have used a apriori alogirthm package which returns frequently used items and their rulesets based on a value of support and confidence.Now in python,i am using the mlxtend ibrary to do the same.But in my case,the algorithm does not return the same rulesets as returned by the other kernel.

Can somebody help me in figuring out where am i making a mistake?

And any other tips on what other analysis can i perform on this dataset will be highly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to secure a position as a data science trainee (1 year / 4 days at the client, 1 day at HQ to receive training).

I will be able to choose the client myself. The clients range from banks, insurance companies, airlines to very small companies as well as municipalities/police.

**But how do I choose a good client?**  


I want to learn A LOT and am happy to work many hours in free time to develop my skills. Ideally I would like to focus on things that are intellectually/computationally challenging and high in demand/widely needed. In other words, beyond having fun, **I wanna learn stuff that will land me a good job afterwards** at a (larger) company. I have no illusion that Google &amp; friends will not take me any time soon, if ever - but I want to migrate tot he US later and not have to take any DS job.

1. **What questions should I ask a client to be able to make an informed decision?**
2. **How do I choose a good DS mentor  at the client/my training company?**
3. **What other tasks &amp; skills should I be looking for to do at a client to get a good start?** 

I assume that becoming fluent in SQl/NoSQL, Spark, Python, several ML techniques and A/B testing, is probably most important for this year?

Also, I assume that big companies like insurance/bank have probably Big Data and need good ML models, whereas municipalities may be happy with just someone doing some DS on a few CSV sheets. 

What do you think?

*P.S. If important: My background is a research MSc in cognitive neuroscience. I am fluent in R, done a lot of research stats, i.e.e GLM,GLMM, MIxed-Effects models, non-parametric testing etc. Now starting to learn Python,Bayesian stats and reading ISLR.*

This is a story of the journey I went through. I wanted to design a machine learning system that would tell me whether I can snooze in the morning and still arrive on time for work.

I do get a bit technical in this article, so I added some links to some of the more advanced terms in this article

If you want to learn how to build image recognition systems, there are better articles out there. But if you want a couple of good chuckles, and see how easy it is to get something that resembles machine learning up and running, then this is article is for you.

(Here's the link to this [article](https://medium.com/@pierrekarpov/can-i-snooze-building-an-image-recognition-system-to-sleep-a-little-longer-a1fedb367c5d) on Medium, if you want to see the amazing gifs I put in)

&amp;#x200B;

### Context and Problem definition

Just after completing Professor Ngs[ Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), I was looking for challenging problems to put those newly learnt algorithms to good use.

I came up with a lot of fun and interesting ideas. But ultimately, none of those were actual problems. Yes, space exploration sounds fun. But lets be real, Im only considering this for the sake of working on a complex project. Not because I have this burning desire to find new clusters of stars.

Then one morning, I once again made the ill-advised decision to hit snooze on my alarm clock. Because of traffic, I arrived gross and sweaty at work, *somewhat* on time..

It was a yucky way to start the day, but it made me realize that this is what I should work on. Theres not much I actually complain about. But if I had the superpower to assert with confidence whether to hit that tempting snooze button, life would truly be wonderful!

The outline of the problem was pretty clear. In the end, we want a system that tells us ahead of time whether the route is clear and sleeping another 10 minutes wont hurt. Luckily for me, it just happens that I live in Singapore, where we have access to a ton of public data, including traffic camera images.

&amp;#x200B;

### Designing a systempipeline

With all this in mind, I designed to following pipeline for my machine learning system:

1. Get traffic camera images
2. Build tool to classify image subsections
3. Classify a lot of examples car/no car
4. Crop and resize selections out of original pictures
5. Build own deep Neural Networks
6. Train Neural Network to detect cars
7. Detect the car sections in actual traffic pictures
8. Count how many cars in pictures
9. Gather images for the times and locations of my commute specifically
10. Build time series with how many cars, at what time, and where
11. Estimate whether there will be traffic tomorrow
12. Snooze peacefully 

And there began my data science journey. And boy oh boy, what a journey!

&amp;#x200B;

### 1. Getting traffic cameraimages

This was surprisingly one of the easiest parts.[ Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/) did an good job with their[ APIs](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/intro-to-apis-what-is-an-api/). With little to no experience with the json, csv, and request Python libraries, you can quickly and neatly download a lot of[ traffic camera images](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/traffic-images).

I decided to download data from all around the country and at all times. Even though in the end we will only need to detect cars in front of my apartment complex at around 9:00 AM. I did that in order to train a **more versatile**Image Recognition System that can then easily be applied to other places and times.

**Now that we have a bunch of traffic camera images, lets work on detecting cars**

&amp;#x200B;

### 2. Classifying subsections of animage

Getting traffic images is great, but unfortunately, can cant just shove that in a Neural Network and expect it to do a decent job at counting cars. (Well maybe we could, but it is probably not the most elegant and accurate way of dealing with the problem).

So I started going through each image, try to keep track of the coordinates of each cars to later crop them out to train our car detection Neural Network. I *very* quickly realized that this was getting out of hand. So I wrote a script to make my life easier.

This is one of the reasons why I fell in love with programming in the first place: **we have the power to make our work tools better**. We use programs to program, so we can program a program, so that it would program better and we dont have to program as much!

I used the[ Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) library to make a program where I can make image selections with only a couple of clicks and key strokes.

**We wrote a script to classify cars within a picture, now is time to use it**

&amp;#x200B;

3. Classifying loads of examples car/nocar

[Labelling traffic cameraimages](https://i.redd.it/hk0dwrat4qq11.png)

Even if it was dull, repetitive work, I managed to label almost 200 cars and more than 1500 non cars selection across 30 ish images, under an hour. I made the executive decision that this was enough data to move on to the next (I was bored).

&amp;#x200B;

### 4. Cropping and resizing selections

This part is also pretty straightforward. The script I wrote for part 3 stores the image selections relevant information in a neat[ csv](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001356.htm) file. I only have to keep track of whether the selection is a car or not, the coordinate of the top left corner, the size of the selection. Knowing all this, I used the[ Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.2.x/) library (I know, it is very fitting to our little project) to crop out cars and non-cars selections.

&amp;#x200B;

### 5. Writing code to build, train, and test my own deep NeuralNetworks

This is it, were building our own[ Neural Network](https://medium.com/technologymadeeasy/for-dummies-the-introduction-to-neural-networks-we-all-need-c50f6012d5eb) lads! Oh boy was I in for a treat. I decided to build it from the ground up, so I would get a deeper grasp of what is going on under the hood. The concepts behind neural networks are not that hard to get (except maybe the derivations for the update functions). But implementing all of it is a whole other story.

For starters, it *really* helps if youre not an idiot. I implemented the different components and all the logic looked fine to me.. However, none of my node weights were updating properly. After a couple hours of debugging, and a couple grams of hair missing from my scalp, I found out I was using Python 2 this whole time where `1 / 2 = 0` and not Python 3 where `1 / 2 = 0.5`. So all my coefficients would at some point end up being 0 (and turns out `0 + a = a`), so the network would not update itself at all.

I also spend a lot of time trying various hyperparameters for the network as I found that it wasnt performing well enough. I was baffled, I was training my 3 layer of 5 units each Neural Network on 9 whole training examples, and *somehow*, the algorithm wasnt doing a good job at guessing the 10th example. I was essentially a 50/50 for the network to get it right. Was I lied to this whole time? Are Neural Networks not the **high-performing-state-of-the-art-predictive-classifier** I was made to believe they were? Luckily, I had the presence of mind that you can update your Neural Network 100,000 times, but *maybe* you need a bit more than 9 data points to get an algorithm somewhat close to being useful.

So I used an actual data set, namely, the[ iris data](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#iris-plants-dataset) set from scikit-learn. Why this one in particular? Well you see, we used the particular data set in one of my favorite class assignments I had in university (we had to build an[ ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm), if youre looking for a fun, math focused problem, go check it out).

The algorithm was now doing better (better than our previous 50/50 algorithm, yay!). However, it was still acting a bit weird. No matter how many times the algorithm was running, or how fast it was performing updates, I would always end up with either a 60% accuracy or a 40% accuracy. I felt really discouraged. Even if it was doing better, how could such an algorithm ever be able to tell cars apart from road signs, if it cant even tell dumb flowers apart??? I was on the verge of quitting programing and following Edmund Blackadders footsteps.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l6c60un35qq11.png

For fun though, I decided to see at least how well Neural Networks from standard libraries would do. So I ran the data set against scikit-learns[ Neural Network classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier). I was astonished. Not only were the results far from the 99% accuracy that I was expecting, but the results were also almost always the same as the results I got when using my implementation. So no matter how ugly and inefficient our code is, we must have gotten a least a couple things right. Hurray!

Our subpar 60% or 40% was in fact not due to our poor implementation, but most likely due to our data set which is *still* too small. **But oh well, we finally have a tool to design and train deep Neural Networks. Good enough by my books, gotta keep moving!**

&amp;#x200B;

### 6. Training Neural Network on carimages

How exciting, we get to finally use our Neural Network we spend an unnecessary amount of time designing! *Errrr wrong, try again next time!*Sadly, our algorithm cant handle too many inputs and logical units. While it was still on par with scikit-learn algorithm for a 5-input and 7-ish-logical-unit networks, it completely blew up up when trying to handle images. (For reference, I am using 32px by 32px with 3 color channels for in image input, so the input has `32 * 32 * 3 = 3072` features which is a lot more than 5)

To be more precise, it was actually my custom[ activation function](https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6) (sigmoid and ReLu) and their derivatives that went boom and tried dividing stuff by 0 (I do not recommend trying to divide by 0).

It was heartbreaking, but we got a problem to fix folks: I still need to know whether I can snooze or not! So I gave in, and used a librarys implementation. Only a fool would change a winning team, so I went with the good ol scikit-learn Neural Network Classifier.

The algorithm was doing quite well actually, right out of the box I got a consistent 88% accuracy over my test set. I then performed[ hyperparameter fine tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization). I looked for the best values for my network size, my learning rate, and the number of iterations to go through. I managed to increase accuracy up to 91%, so I saved the Neural Network model and called it a day.

**We ended up training a Neural Network with 90%+ accuracy, lets see how it holds against raw traffic images.**

&amp;#x200B;

### 7. Detecting car sections inpictures

Its great that our algorithm is working fine on pre-cropped car/no car images. Now we need to find those cars in traffic camera images. I chose to go with the[sliding window technique](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/23/sliding-windows-for-object-detection-with-python-and-opencv/). Essentially I look at the top left corner, see if it is a car or not, if it is, I keep track of that car. Then I slide to the right, and when i reach the end of the line, I go back to the left and shift down.

There is no doubt in my mind that this approach is one of the most gruesome out there. But pigs dont get fat on clear water. In that case, were the pig and we need some fatty porridge. Maybe in the future well be more sophisticated and well use crystal clear feature detections methods.. But not now. I want results and I want them fast!

The results were.interesting. It was doing ok, but a lot of consistent errors that I could foresee would impair our traffic detection algorithm.

&amp;#x200B;

[First run on an actual trafficimage](https://i.redd.it/yp8yzofb5qq11.png)

As you can see, it does detect some cars pretty well, but also the arrows indicating the roads destinations. And more importantly, it detected *a lot* of cars on the right and the bottom

Turns out, I was trying to detect cars outside the picture on the right and at the bottom. I was doing one too many slide in both direction.. This [tweet](https://twitter.com/secretGeek/status/7269997868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E7269997868&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fmedia%2Ff851a0cd2be727811c5a1fced376bee5%3FpostId%3Da1fedb367c5d) felt painfully relevant at that time.

All jokes aside, after fixing that issue and refining the parameters, we got something that wasnt half bad, and I was happy.

&amp;#x200B;

[Labels and lane dividers are still an issue, but it s good enough to get something towork.](https://i.redd.it/4l8l0exj5qq11.png)

**Now that we detect cars pretty well, its high time we count how many there are in a picture.**

&amp;#x200B;

### 8. Countingcars

So our sliding door technique paired with our car recognition system work pretty well. But now, how are we supposed to know how many cars there are?? We cant just count how many times our car algorithm detects a car. As you can see from the previous image, one car can be detected multiple times, and some non car sections are detected, but only once, and probably should be ignored.

This sort of looked like a clustering project, so of course, having just learn the[k-nearest-neighbors](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/) technique, I just dove into implementing it for our problem. One thing though, this technique actually requires you to know how many neighborhood there are (in our case, how many cars there are). Huh?? But thats what were trying to find out.. But its all good, well run k-NN for all numbers between 1 and 30, and see which one is *the most correct.* It actually did work, surprisingly. But god was it slow.

Then, one day while I was grocery shopping (thats not relevant to the story at all, but Im rolling with it), I realized I was overcomplicating things for no good reason. How would a 3 year old solve this, I asked myself. Well, they would probably color any blob that is connected, then do that for all the blobs in the picture, and count how many times they colored a blob.

So I did just that, a 3-year-olds coloring algorithm and ran it against our beloved traffic camera images. It definitely was ugly and inaccurate, but heres the thing: we dont need to know how many cars there are. What we need, is the number of cars detected to go up significantly when the actual number of cars is high, and vice versa. Luckily for me, my algorithm was doing just that. Yay me!

&amp;#x200B;

[We detected 13 cars, top left is the image with the detected cars, bottom left is the neighborhood heights, top right is the normalized neighborhoods, one of them colored in, bottom right is the same as top right but we removed the colored neighborhood \(so we dont count isagain\)](https://i.redd.it/tkyy8vlr5qq11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

[We detected 20 cars here. While there probably arent 20 cars, it s a higher number than what we detected on the previous image, and there is significantly moretraffic](https://i.redd.it/1l4157qt5qq11.png)

**We can finally estimate the traffic flow, all thats left for us to do is to build traffic historical data, so we can extrapolate for future days.**

### 9. Gathering images down my apartment at9am

Ezpz, thats just step 1, but instead of looking at any and all picture the government allows me to see, I need to only look at the ones coming from camera 6703 around 9AM, because ultimately thats all I care about. Boom, onto the next step!

### 10. Building traffic timeseries

Ezpz squared! We just get those car counts and timestamps we got from last step and store them in some file somewhere. Damn were really dashing through those stages arent we?

### 11. Extrapolating from our timeseries

So lets recap, we have the *number of cars* there was for the past 20 days *ish*. Now lets guess what its gonna be tomorrow! Better yet, lets guess for the next 5 days!

At first I wanted to use a[ LSTM](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-lstms-to-forecast-time-series-4ab688386b1f) algorithm as it is the state of the art and it does well against seasonal trends, and that might be a thing for traffic. Upon further reading, I learnt that LSTM actually relies on a recurrent Neural Network architecture. Having only 20 data points, I did not want to repeat our step 5 disaster and waste countless hours for nothing. So in the end, I went with the[ ARIMA](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/03/time-series-dummies-3-step-process.html) method, which also does well with seasonal trend, but is uses a more statistical approach that works with fewer data points.

We got something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Blue is actual data, red is prediction](https://i.redd.it/y7nw6ekx5qq11.png)

Not too shabby, huh? Considering we trained the model on 15 examples to guess the next 5. You know what, I ship it!

**Hurray! We gathered enough data to predict the future! Nostradamus would be so proud.**

&amp;#x200B;

### 12. Snoozing peacefully 

I now check every night if I will snooze tomorrow. Never have I ever been late for work since! And my project and I lived happily ever after, the end.

*Errrr wrong again, better luck next time!*

Even though were estimating the number of cars pretty well, and predicting tomorrows traffic somewhat decently, there are still improvements to make. Of course, we have plenty of places to look for optimization. But the bigger problem is that our base hypothesis is not accurate enough. Yes, traffic does play a big role in determining the length of my commute, but the commute itself plays a huge role too. You see, I take the bus then the train to go to work. While missing a train only adds another 2 minutes to my morning travels. If I get unlucky and three buses pass by me just before I can get to them, I might be looking at another 20 minutes to my 40 minute journey..

&amp;#x200B;

### Where to go fromthere

As I just mentioned, it would be interesting to make use of the real time bus arrival updates and see how much it would improve our current system.

Of course we can always improve our car recognition Neural Network by feeding it more labelled data. We can also improve of our simple sliding doors and neighborhood counting techniques

Ultimately, checking the traffic the day before isnt the most practical anyway. So ideally, we have a script that runs on its own while we sleep, and counts cars in real time. Based on that, it rings the alarm sooner or later.

&amp;#x200B;

### Parting thoughts

Wow that was a long story, Im glad you made it this far.

All in all, it has been a blast building this entire system from scratch. And I was surprised at how easy it ended up being. This is mainly because I forced myself to work on it in small increments, but everyday. Once youve figured out how to break big problems into smaller ones, the sky is the limit.

So, be ambitious! Go and solve complex things! As long as you enjoy doing it, all you need is to keep at it and youll have something to be proud of in the end!

You can find all the code[ here](https://github.com/pierrekarpov/can-i-hit-snooze-today). The code isnt really plug and play, but Im more than happy to answer any questions you may have.

However the patients I am dealing with have a tendency for mental disorders already and are not representative of the general population. Isn't this a significant selection bias? 

TLDR2: How would you usually deal with high-dimensional data when you don't know much about the meaning of each feature? 

Hi everyone, I am a third year bachelor student in Data Science and Knowledge Engineering and I am currently doing an internship in a Healthcare company in the context of my studies. The company treats psychosomatic and psychological disorders (with a focus on back pain and depression) and I've been tasked to build a model that predicts the sustainability of their treatment on a new patient. 

It is my first real data science project and I am not sure of the correct methodology to approach this problem, as well as whether I am indeed at risk of a selection bias. I recently started following this subreddit and have found the community to be very friendly and helpful, so I figured I might ask here for some guidance. 

Before explaining the reasons why there might be a selection bias, allow me to give you some more details on the type of data I am dealing with. A patient coming in for treatment has to fill in a set of questionnaires aiming to collect information on his perceived symptoms and coping mechanisms. Each of the questionnaires results into a score and the set of scores (and replies) are assessed by the psychologists and different other specialists to determine whether the patient should undergo treatment or not. If a patient ends up starting the treatment, he will have to fill in the same set of questionnaires another 2 to 3 times at different phases of the treatment. The set is composed of around 24 questionnaires and each patient is linked to about 20 different demographic features. 

The company is essentially asking me to cluster patients and to predict their likelihood of successfully completing the treatment. Based on these information I think I can better explain the issues I am facing. 

The first one is that the patients which try to get treatment at this company have already been diagnosed by their general practitioner and have already attempted other treatments. They are therefore more prone to having certain symptoms and are not representative of the general population. Doesn't that represent a significant selection bias which would render any predictive model flawed? I am not too sure how to deal with this issue and the managers don't seem to accept this as a real issue. 

The second one is that I haven't dealt with such high-dimensional data before and I don't know how to get started with the feature selection. I have read it is recommended to do PCA before clustering but I also stumbled upon a paper which performed fuzzy clustering before dimensionality reduction. I guess have to experiment a lot but I would appreciate any tips or guidance to get started in such a situation. 

Sorry for the long post, I am not too familiar with posting on such a subject and I hope I didn't provide too many details. Thank you for any help!

The first few times this happened I didn't answer well.  It felt a bit like being asked if I could tie my shoes.

My master's is from a well-known university and they can easily verify what is taught in the program.  I.e. it's not a matter of them just taking my word for it.

The capper is often the job posting calls for advanced skills, degrees, and yadda.  And I when I ask about the kind of work they are doing, often they can't even really answer.

I had 3 offers for a data science position and took one with a tech start up as I liked their product idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two months into the job, I'm regretting it. They're just getting their analytics program off the ground and I've spent the first month just figuring out the data and getting it structured. Most of my work has been updating Tableau visualizations that other people have done. If I try and make improvements, I get hit with ""why did you make that change?"" ""What is your rationale"", or ""The client is used to this, so we want to stick with it"". I have 4 years experience in building/selling dashboards and visual analytics and have to update Tableau workbooks of people that do not have an analytical mindset. Plus the dashboards are just aggregation of data, no actual insight other than filtering and looking at flow. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of my other work relies on waiting for Engineering to do their side of things. I don't have access to everything for security reasons, so if I want to set up an AWS S3 instance or an Athena instance to automate Tableau, I have to wait until Engineering to get it up. So in between, I have nothing to do other than research.

&amp;#x200B;

Everytime I do something, my boss second guesses it or says ""are you sure you did everything correctly"", just completely undermining my work. I said I needed work and he gave me a list of basic changes to do on Tableau then went to lunch. Took 10 minutes to complete. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel I'm not getting the full picture of what needs to be done or what the company wants, so have no direction to plan or what areas I should focus on improving. The base of the product doesn't even really rely on data science although I can think of a handful of ways we can implement it. I'm also afraid I'm going to lose my machine learning skills since I don't use them currently (I've been taking datacamp courses to keep fresh). 

&amp;#x200B;

I left my actuarial consulting position because I was too overworked. Now I hardly have any work and what I'm doing now is not challenging at all. But I'm only 2 months in. Not sure what to do, but wanted to vent.

Is it recommended to model this with regular classification type models but with clever feature engineering or with a more specialized model (survival analysis?) that takes this temporal aspect into account?

Quick question to see if anyone has had experience resolving this. Essentially, my boss is hell bent on turing the work the data engineering team does into a partially self service model. A la, a product manager should be able to do a basic ETL job to extra their own information etc. or even god for sake modify one engineering has built. 

My opinion is that it's way too techincal to ask like a product manager to setup even a basic ETL job to extract any form of complex information. In fact, they shouldn't even have to as they shouldn't have to worry about digging through a bunch of crappy data in order to get the info they need so that they can make the appropriate product decision (that's what a data engineer is there for).

Has anyone figured something to allow PMs to do light techincal work outside of running selection queries? Like a tool or working or something similar? Personally, I'm going to try and convince my boss that having non engineers do engineering work is too much, even the simplest like adding a column to a table would require them to be trained on engineering, but I need some evidence to show this because he's convinced otherwise.

Just like a chess player, we want to not only gain valuable insights from studying and analyzing Data, but also want to be able to simulate different scenarios and pick the most favorable outcomes. Lastly, we want to monitor the results of our decisions and make adjustments as needed.

Having spent almost a decade designing and implementing all sorts of data-related solutions and services taught me that reaching what at times seems to be the ultimate pinnacle of intelligence is actually just another vantage point, soon to be dwarfed by the next question being asked. During that process we gain a deeper understanding of actual behaviors while imposing ever-increasing demands on Data. We also set even higher standards for Knowledge and Intelligence.

The more intriguing part is that we cannot engineer what we cannot define. Therefore, being able to define the Problem is where everything should begin. As we all know, these days there are plenty of challenges to address in Healthcare. Unfortunately none of these challenges are trivial, therefore having access to good quality medical data becomes increasingly valuable. It is not only the quality, but also its volume the reasons researchers find Data extremely valuable.

BitMED is on a mission to help solve some of the most pressing Healthcare challenges by building a system that we all as a society can benefit from.

I hope this short preamble peeked your interest. In this series of articles Id like to take you through this journey and share quite a few of the learnings gathered over the years.

In the first article we will discuss the three stages of the Journey. In the next articles well go in a lot more details.

Meanwhile, here is a preview of what well talk about in from the first article. Well use the next figure to start defining (very simplistically!) the Data Journey and its major stages.

Assume in this scenario that we have a pre-trained model that is \~4GB (e.g. a large Word2Vec, random forest, or speech-to-text model).

* If I wanted to ***run this model locally,*** I can read it into local memory and run the predict function.
* If I wanted to ***run this model on a cloud VM,*** I can provision a single VM with a persistent disk, and save the model to that disk. Then any time I'd like to use the model, I can turn on the VM instance, load the model, and run predict. 
* Similiarly one can do the same inside a Docker image on that VM

***My question is how to scale up this model to say dozens or hundreds of instances (ideally autoscaling quickly)?***

1. A direct approach is enclose the large model in a very large Docker image, and deploy that image in a container management service (e.g. Kubernetes).
2. Another approach is to have a lean Docker image (executing code), and store the model in a remote store (e.g. S3 bucket), sacrificing load time a bit.

This  seems like it should be something a lot of people have already thought  about, but I've had a lot of trouble finding any literature or  discussion of the topic on-line.

One can  think of the count of active users as a census, in which case it can be  argued that a confidence interval is not meaningful.  Realistically  however, there is some statistical process that generates the DAU counts  each day, which has some expectation on each day - it should be  possible to calculate a confidence interval around the observed count as  an estimate of the expectation of the process.  I think that an  explicit time-series model is probably unnecessarily complex here  though.

As a simple example, we could  imagine that we have some population, n, of possible users and that the  observed DAU is binomial(n, p) for some p.  Or we could consider the DAU  count each day to be poisson distributed.  Neither of these however  seems likely to be a very good approach.

Is there a template that people who participate follow? Like have ready to go tools/classes that formats data into a standardized frame, does initial analyses, and so on? 

If so, could you please share? A general guideline would also be very helpful. I work at a job where Im very much siloed, and really the lone data scientist on the entire floor.

*Processing img e5w913bhtbr11...*

&amp;#x200B;

This is your chance to join (and compete with) other 5k students studying Machine Learning.  Visit [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai), deadline for the first assignment is October 14, 20:59 CET. Video lectures on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKTuw4PNOsU&amp;list=PLVlY_7IJCMJeRfZ68eVfEcu-UcN9BbwiX) YouTube playlist will help you. Now more details. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What?**

[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/) is an open and free ML course led by OpenDataScience, or [ods.ai](https://ods.ai/), a big (&gt;19k members) community known firstly for its top Kagglers. The course is 10-week long and has lots of practice including assignments (each week), Kaggle Inclass competitions, individual projects, and tutorials. However, focus is made on a perfect balance between theory and practice, so [prerequisites](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/wiki/Prerequisites:-Python,-math-and-DevOps) include both basic math concepts and Python skills.

This is actually a MOOC, \~4k guys already passed it in Russian, now is the second time the course launches in English, already &gt;5k participants. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What's so special about the course?**

* There will be an interactive [student rating](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19AGEhUQUol6_kNLKSzBsjcGUU3qWy3BNUg8x8IFkO3Q) making it fun to participate and motivating to endure till the end. Yes, this thing really motivates you, lots of participants confirmed that
* It's not for total beginners, the pace is pretty intensive, check out [prerequisites](https://mlcourse.ai/prerequisites)
* The course is supported by a big and alive community, you''ll find authors of articles/assignments/competitions right in the same Slack channel. We chat informally, with jokes and gags
* If you finish the course, you'll master most essential skills required for a Junior Data Scientist 
* The course is free after all

All main material is already there in a form of Medium articles, Kaggle Kernels, and Jupyter notebooks, [https://mlcourse.ai/resources](https://mlcourse.ai/resources)

&amp;#x200B;

**Lectures** 

Visit [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKTuw4PNOsU&amp;list=PLVlY_7IJCMJeRfZ68eVfEcu-UcN9BbwiX) YouTube playlist, lectures are recorded in process, new ones will be uploaded on Fridays/weekends. Though English is not perfect, still you'll see that complicated concepts are expressed in a very intuitive and comprehensible, even for those with no background in math. Just check it out! Start with an introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKTuw4PNOsU&amp;list=PLVlY_7IJCMJeRfZ68eVfEcu-UcN9BbwiX&amp;index=1). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Articles**

We consider this to be the main content. You'll go from exploratory data analysis with Pandas all the way through logistic regression and Random Forests to gradient boosting, which is an engine under the hood of many real-world systems applying Machine Learning (ex. search and recommender systems).  

Jupyter notebooks for all 10 topic are found on [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai), main page. The same is also kept in a form of [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse/kernels) (editable and interactive) in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse) Kaggle Dataset. Or Medium articles (a [""publication""](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course)), if you prefer that. Finally, if you are used to work with git &amp; GitHub, go directly to the [course repo](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Assignments**

Assignments cover each topic, from Pandas till gradient boosting. Are announced in the **#mlcourse\_ai** channel in [ODS Slack team](https://opendatascience.slack.com/). Also, links to fresh assignments are provided in the Readme file of the [course repository](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai). Deadlines are typically on Sundays, 20:59 CET. Apart from that, you can practice with demo assignments. See tab [assignments](https://mlcourse.ai/assignments) on the main site.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitions**

We like Kaggle, it can be a very cool activity, especially for beginners who only start gaining practical experience in ML. We propose two Kaggle Inclass competitions during the course. In some assignments your task will be to beat baselines in these competitions, many guys called these the best ML exercises they've already seen.

Both competitions are not for ""stacking xgboosts"" but require you to come up with nice features (feature engineering is arguably the most interesting part of a Data Scientist's work) and apply (most probably) simple linear models. 

In the 1st [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) youll be solving the task of user identification tracking his/her sequence of visited websites. In the second [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-good-is-your-medium-article/) you are challenged to predict popularity (number of claps) of an article on Medium.

&amp;#x200B;

**Individual projects**

Your own project for the whole run of the course. Clear instructions, peer review in the end. Arguably, it's the best experience that you can get during the course. For those who don't have nice data to work on, we propose a project with clear instructions in a form of Jupyter notebooks. More info to appear [here](https://mlcourse.ai/roadmap).  

&amp;#x200B;

**How to join**

Fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_pDNuVHwBxV5wuOcdaXoxBZneyAQcqfOl4V2qkqKbNQ/edit), it's also mentioned on the main page [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai). Yo'll get an invitation to OpenDataScience Slack team. You're encouraged to watch the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKTuw4PNOsU&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLVlY_7IJCMJeRfZ68eVfEcu-UcN9BbwiX), it's not that long but will answer most of your questions. 

Once again, you can still join the course, deadline for A1 is October 14. Even if you miss it, you still have much more activities to catch up, get credits and finish in a top-100 list. Even if you don't manage o win, you'll get very cool and valuable experience. 

Good luck! And ask here your questions.

One issue I'm trying to accomplish is seeing point in time and point in % complete comparison between laps. I've tried calculating the distance traveled at each interval and deriving the % complete. However, the GPS data isn't the most precise, so of the 2mile track, my best lap is only 98% of the actual track distance. Also, it doesn't account for taking the wide turn vs short. (IE you drive further because you turned wide but actually have progressed less across the total track). Is it better to define checkpoints and calculate % complete based on that?

I'm also trying to take the best segments of each lap and calculate what the optimal time would have been. Is there a term or algorithm for this to get started?

The last point is cleaning GPS data. When mapped against google maps, it shows it driving off the track on a straight away, is there an algorithm to correct those points to within the track's center gps coordinates +- track width?

### Introduction

The Harvard Business Review called the data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century. As problem solvers and analysts, data scientists are the professionals identifying patterns, noticing trends and making new discoveries, often working with real-time data, machine learning, and AI.

Data scientists are in high demand, with forecasts from IBM suggesting that the number of data scientists will reach 28 percent by 2020. In the US alone, the number of roles for all US data professionals will reach 2.7 million. Also, powerful software programmes have given us access to deeper analytics than ever before. This analysis of data generated by people, places and things is a goldmine of invaluable insight

With the increase in demand, many people are rushing into the [data science opportunities](https://dimensionless.in/data-science-using-r-python). With the large influx of people into this field and most of them being freshers, people are committing many basic mistakes while progressing in their data science career.

### 10 CommonMistakes to Avoid to Master Data Science

In this blog, we will be looking at some of the very common mistakes that all of us as data scientists make. We will also try to address these issues with probable solutions to them.

**1.Spending a lot of time learning concepts without any practical application**

All the work and no play makes Jack a dull boy! You may have heard of this during your childhood days and trust me, it significantly holds true in data science too. Learning too much theory and not applying them does more harm than good. The theory is designed as keeping the ideal conditions in mind but these things do not hold practical with real-world problems. For example, you learn to apply a specific algorithm to solve a problem. The algorithm takes some parameters as input which is there with you while learning theory. But, in real-world situations, half of those required parameters will be missing and then there will be a challenge to apply that algorithm to solve a given problem at hand. A good data scientist is one who knows how to handle real-world data and constraints and generate usable insights out of it rather than a one who has a lot of knowledge but no experience in implementing them. I am surely not saying that going over a lot of theory is bad, what I am saying is collecting a lot of theory in your mind and not applying it anywhere is worse. **Solution **  
Your learning process should be a mix of both theory and practice. Whenever you learn something new, try to find a dataset and apply it over there. Take part in different competitions on websites like kaggle because you will not only learn more here but also will gain experience with the implementation of different concepts

**2. Directly jumping to Machine Learning and (fancy) algorithms**  
Let us all clear this misconception first that machine learning is not everything data science has to offer. Data science is all about solving a given problem. It is a process which starts with understanding the problem and collecting data for the same to delivering insights and solutions for the problem. Between this, machine learning is a small portion(borrowed from computer science field) which helps in making predictions or wiser judgments with the data at hand. Many people directly jump to machine learning or give a lot of importance to it but this should not be the case. It is still ok if you want to be a machine learning engineer in the future but definitely not ok for a data scientist. Machine learning is not everything which data science has to offer. There are statistics, domain knowledge and communication skills attached to it too.

**Solution **  
The solution here is pretty simple. First, if you are really interested in machine learning, you should focus on its internal math also. You should first ensure you have a good grasp of linear algebra and calculus before directly deep diving into the machine learning. Secondly, one should pay attention to other aspects of data science and should focus on problem understanding more than applying a fancy algorithm to solve it.

**3. Considering model accuracy to be supreme**  
Accuracy isnt always what the business is after. Sure a model that predicts employee retention probability with 95% accuracy is good, but if you cant explain how the model got there, which features led it there, and what your thinking was when building the model, your client will reject it. Accuracy sue is important but interpretability holds more importance. Maybe this is the case why deep neural networks are rarely used in the production given they are not highly interpretable.

**Solution **  
You can have a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability of the model. Try to understand how much accuracy fits in the domain of the business problem and whether the client is interested more in results or understanding of the problem and factors related to it

**4. More attention to tools rather than the problem at hand**  
In data science, tools are not important but the solution to the problem is. It does not matter how you get to the solution considering tools in hand. Tools are for the purpose of making life easier and enabling one to perform tasks quickly hence one should not pay large attention to the usage of tools. For example, one should not try to fit in machine learning everywhere uselessly. Having a solid knowledge of tools and libraries is excellent, but it will only take you so far. Combining that knowledge with the business problem posed by the domain is where a true data scientist steps in. You should be aware of at least the basic challenges in the industry you are interested in (or are applying to).  
**Solution **  
Search for datasets in a specific industry and try to work on them. This will create an impact on your resume. You should also focus on having domain knowledge of the problem you are trying to solve

**5. Trying to learn everything at once**  
This is one of the most common mistakes many data scientists end up doing. Being a jack of all trades and master of none may give your knowledge a lot of breadths and but you will always lack the required depth. You will be able to start an approach to provide a solution to the problem but it will be very rare that you will till the end of it properly. One can not learn everything in one go.  
**Solution-**  
Try to find an area of deeper interest within data science and try getting depth in your knowledge and after that, you can work on increasing the breadth

**6. Jumping to conclusions without proper validation**  
I have seen data scientists jumping straight to conclusions without validating results they are getting from their analysis or model predictions.   
**Solution-**  
Perform hypothesis testing and validate/invalidate all the insights you have generated by conducting statistical tests for their significance

**7. Negligence towards data cleansing, EDA and visualizations**  
Many data scientist skim over the concepts of data cleaning, EDA and visualizations and move to data modeling. Understanding data first and make it usable for modeling is paramount hence a lot of attention should be given to these topics to emerge out as a successful data scientist  
**Solution-**  
Take up datasets from different sources and try finding insights out of them. Try to build a story around datasets with help of graphs and numbers extracted out of the dataset. This practice will help you in understanding the data better

**8. Thinking that communication skill is not required**  
Communications skills are one of the most under-rated and least talked about aspects a data scientist absolutely MUST possess. I am yet to come across a course that places a solid emphasis on this. You can learn all the latest techniques, master multiple tools and make the best graphs, but if you cannot explain your analysis to your client, you will fail as a data scientist. And not just clients, you will also be working with team members who are not well versed with data science  IT, HR, finance, operations, etc. You can be sure that the interviewer will be monitoring this aspect throughout.  
**Solution-**  
One of the things, I find most helpful, is explaining data science terms to a non-technical person. It helps me gauge how well I have articulated the problem. If youre working in a small to medium-sized company, find a person in the marketing or sales department and do this exercise with them. It will help you immensely in the long term.

**9.Giving too much importance to coding skills**  
If you are a data scientist, you will have to code but this is not the hardest part of it. People tend to think that data science is all about coding and should put a lot of attention in coding skills. No doubt coding skills are required but one need not master it all-together.   
**Solution-**  
People should focus more on creative ways of solving a problem rather than focussing too much on their coding skills. There are many softwares to perform the tasks for data scientists. Again coding is an essential skill but not a mandatory skill.

**10. Insufficient research on the problem at hand**  
Many problems do not reach a convincing solution just because the initial research on the problem was less or the domain knowledge related to that problem was not sufficient. People tend to jump into the problem directly without getting enough domain knowledge or performing a good initial research on what the problem is and how one should go about it.  
**Solution-**  
Conduct an extensive initial research and try to get the complete idea of the industry domain of the problem you are dealing with. Try to talk to the people from the same domain and understand how the process flows in that business line.

### Conclusion

These mistakes are not easy to avoid when you are starting fresh in the data science career. I have also done many of the above mistakes that I have mentioned above. It takes an experience to understand why all the above points make sense. As we grow in experience, we learn and we get better and emerge out as a champion!

* Each week we work through a small section of the book and post questions we have on the relevant thread on blackswans.io for the rest of the group to answer.
* Each fortnight we set an optional programming challenge, e.g., create an RNN for stock price prediction using TensorFlow, and compare our code.

Id like to finish the first section *Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics* by Christmas, which translates to about 15 pages per week.

Goal : Which activities are most useful in predicting user purchase in the future? Predict next 25 UserIDs who are likely to purchase?

My Understanding 1: From my knowledge this is a classification problem that cant be solved using algorithms like Random Forests and Logistic regression because the activity types do not further have additional activities and the sort. The solution according to me could be derived using a more standard technique like Naive Bayes or Nearest Neighbor algorithms.

My Understanding 2: Further is this a type of recommendation problem, if so I do not think Content based filtering would work as there are very less features, it should be better to use collaborative filtering as I would utilize the Date field.

My Understanding 3: Will One hot encoding of the Activity field help me (Make 3 separate features for activity) and converting the Date field into (Day, Month, Year) help?

I would like to know your thoughts and opinions of what kind of classification algorithm might give me the best prediction of a User that might purchase next.

I have found that in regression problems models are often compared based on their RMSE score. This is fine, but I feel like I lack some interpretation with this measure.

For example, when predicting house prices, an RMSE might not really be interpretable. It would, in my opinion, be more suitable to communicate results based on a % accuracy to measure ""how far off"" our model is? So perhaps we can take the (absolute) percentage deviation for each prediction and average those over the entire dataset. (It might be the same to take the RMSE divided by the mean of all the target values, not sure..).

Data Scientist, I want to move to NYC. What should the next step be?

Hello everyone! It is my first post in this sub, I hope I get everything right. Let me know if I should reformat or change anything.

I am a bit confused and I'd like to seek some advice or insight.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short: I am a spanish Data Scientist, now living in London, getting a PhD in Actuarial Science (1st year). The thing is that my goal is to move to NYC (might be a silly dream, but that is what I want) and continue my career as Data Scientist there. Since I got here, I've rejected several job offers so I could focus in the PhD. But I'm starting to question whether the best option for my career is this PhD; or maybe I should gain more experience in the actual field if I want to be good enough to get the visa and all of that struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you a bit about my backstory. I feel a bit fool doing it and I am not sure if I should, but I am quite confused at this point and I might need some perspective.  


I grew up in a tiny coastal village in Spain. From a quite low-income family, I worked as waiter since I was 16 (minimum legal age in Spain to work) during weekends and summers. I moved to Barcelona to get in University and I got a Bachelor's in Physics, and did an internship in oceanographic research (data gathering and processing, mainly). 

Since I had always wanted to go to New York and I kinda liked reading about economics and finance, I decided to get a Master's in Financial Mathematics. I thought that the Financial industry was some straightforward path to get it to NY. I started to work in a Bank as Risk Analyst (this is the point of my life when I stopped working part-time as waiter) and I absolutely hated it. Every day working there was terribly bitter. I don't like to be seen as whining, and I am not the kind of person that complaints about everything. But the job was painfully boring, the environment was cruel and soulless and I wasn't learning barely anything of my interest. Luckily, I started to get some curiosity about Machine Learning and Data Science in general as I saw some of its applications in banking industry. Eventually, I decided to drop the job and start another Master's with the money I had been able to save up. This Master's was on Data Science &amp; Mathematical Modelling. I loved it. I learned a lot of interesting things and I got this amazing internship in a Videogame company, in their Data Science team. Amazing. The best working experience of my life. It wasn't perfect, of course, but I loved every day of it.

My master's thesis happened to impress somebody, and I got recommended to some other guy. And I ended up having two offers for a PhD student position. One in another university of Barcelona and the other one in London. Both of them seeking someone in this middle ground between Data Science and Finance. I talked with my boss in the videogame company and he told me that - even though he'd like to keep me in the company - these phd positions were too good to be rejected and was the best option for me. I ended up getting the offer in London, mainly because I thought it would be my best chance to finally get to another country and to actually learn english (both things should be extremely helpful if I want to make it to NYC).

Some months working in the phd, I have the feeling that I am not learning that much. I am learning very niche things about actuarial science. Which could be interesting, but it is not Data Science related and I don't feel like is helping me to step up my game in the field I am interested. The scolarship is quite low and I am struggling quite a bit to get it to the end of the month, and I am rejecting many job offers in Data Science positions where I could get paid a lot more.  


I am not sure whether I should drop the PhD and gain more experience in actual Data Science positions if I want to get a job in NYC. I know that getting the visa and everything is pretty hard, and that I should be really good and have an impressive resume. I am not sure if what I'm doing is the best option to get what I want. In the meantime I am looking for part-time jobs or remote jobs in DS, for I have some free time that I could use to gain experience and get some money. But I'm not finding anything related.

I know I am lucky to have gotten these opportunities and I actually feel grateful for all this. I just try to chose wisely

Both degrees would enable me to take 2 semesters of calculus-based statistics, 1 semester of probability theory, numerical analysis, and mathematical modeling. 

In terms of differences, the Statistics program would have likely have me do more with theory of interest, analysis, etc. The Computational track would have me do graph theory, combinatorics, etc.

I'm a 27-year old with a BA and MS in Speech-Language Pathology and am currently working as a full-time speech-language pathologist but am hoping to make a career change/transition into data science. I have always had a strong interest in mathematics, data analysis, and computer programming with a natural inclination to discover explanations for the seemingly inexpiable, so I feel data science a natural fit. Because my background is not related to computer science, mathematics or analytics, I will have to return to school to get a relevant bachelor/masters (presumably one in data science, although I hear data analysis/CS/math/statistics degrees allow for entry into the field as well). The uncertainty of leaving a career with excellent job security for one I am less familiar with is foreign territory but have found the presence of a subreddit dedicated to data science comforting.   
 

I was wondering if any of you had advice for me in steps I should take in maximizing the likelihood of a successful data science career transition. Based on reading the subreddit and pages that appeared on Google, it seems I should be focusing on learning programming languages such as Python, SQL and R prior to school. I do not anticipate being able to learn these languages (or even one in its entirety) prior to starting school again, but they seem like baseline skills for work that are glossed over in non-computer science programs.  
 

I am in the process of applying to data science programs in my area (near Providence, Rhode Island). Is anyone familiar with the quality of the data science programs at University of Rhode Island, University of Massachusetts  Dartmouth, and/or Bryant University? I am looking for physical schools that are both nearby and affordable, although have not entirety ruled-out online programs (I hear UC Berkley has a solid program). UMass Dartmouth has an accelerated BS to MS degree program that would theoretically allow me to get out of school in back into the work force at a faster rate. My GPA was &gt;3.9 and 3.8 in undergrad and grad school, respectively, in the event that helps you to recommend programs.  
 

Once I have my bachelors, is there a type of entry-level position I should look into so I can transition into a more competitive job upon receiving my masters?

Hello all, I hope you dont mind me posting on this forum; 

I am hoping to generate some discussion, build some contacts in this space, and seek some feedback on an idea.

I am a Chartered Building Surveyor (UK property professional) based in London. I specialise in diagnosing building defects and their associated remedial works. Over the past year I have been researching the possibilities of using computer vision / NLP / augmented reality to transform our technical communication and interaction with clients. I have been inspired by the progress achieved by Babylon Healthcare and their approach to developing automated medical advice. 

At the moment, I am exploring the idea of generating advice using image classification techniques, via a chatbot or visual interface. Users could obtain best practice information specific to building materials or individual components identified by a classifier.

Please correct me if I am wrong; however I believe there is great potential here to scale consultancy services beyond traditional clients (large corporations, investment funds, local authorities, wealthy individuals etc). I would dearly like to democratise access to professional level expertise, so that individual homeowners / tenants can manage their largest asset with consistent, trusted information. 

The most advantageous scenario would be the gradual automation of our repetitive, time intensive activities (report writing, project administration, cost estimation etc.). This would permit us to focus on soft skills such as judgement, empathy and network building as key drivers of our value.

To date I have progressed this idea from initial research and training (completing online ML / DL courses , including training a neural network on a local machine with python to recognise cat / dog pictures), to preparing a basic app prototype that provides a visual, interactive demonstration of my current thinking;

[https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/VSJPMUAR9Y3](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/VSJPMUAR9Y3)

I have also developed (with a freelance ML engineer) a very basic classifier that can identify between 3 roofing materials as a technical proof of concept, using training / validation data sourced from search engines with web scraping tools. Finally, I am considering proposals to build a REST API (using Auto ML vision) and basic web application for market validation purposes. 

Hence why I am now reaching out to the data science / ML community; the property sector is only now playing catch-up with technology, and there remains little interaction between our spheres on a day-to-day basis. An ingrained attitude towards IT guys does not help. There are of course numerous proptech startups, but there remains plenty of scope to disrupt traditional consultancy.

As such, I would be very grateful for some guidance on the following;

1. How does computer vision perform 'in the wild', i.e. is it technically feasible for users to point phone cameras at external building elements, identify materials (perhaps rapidly, once 5G is available), and then display appropriate maintenance information (via augmented reality)?
2. Regarding data; as ML algorithms develop, can we expect to see a decrease in the amount of training data necessary to achieve good accuracies?

Im not a data scientist, so Im hoping my fellow redittors can help me out here.



TL:DR:
Want to compare lead data (we buy from 3rd parties) to our total website visitors (all sources). We believe that with that we can say something about how the market is behaving (as we dont cap the leads we but) and how popular our service is in a certain month. With that we want to see how well our website/online marketing is performing.



So I said Im not a data scientist, however for my boss Im reporting on SEO data on a monthly base. During one of our last meetings we had a discussion about the leads they receive on a monthly base from third parties. My boss wondered if we couldnt do something with that number. Could we use the total amount of leads received to say something about the general interest in their service? And could we then also compare that number to the total amount of website visitors to say something about our overall performance compared to the general interest in their service..?

* So question 1 is:
 Is this the right data to find the answers to these questions.

* If so, Question 2 would be:
how would I report that in a graph. Just put the two next to each other and compare over years?

* If not. What are things we could do with the lead data?

More info about the lead data:
Their are several websites where we buy leads from. We do this on a monthly base and the offered leads are not capped in any way. So from that weve the feeling that it indicates how the market is behaving in a certain month and how high in demand our service is that month. This is an assumption we work with and cant really validate.

Final remarks:
* weve got yoy-data
* Im looking for a direction of what to do with this data
* I know we are working with an assumption, but Im curious to see if we can find a relation between the data points
* thanks in advance for your help/thoughts",1,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

A user satisfaction survey was conducted for two groups for a social media platform. Assume large sample sizes.

Group 1 opted into security features Group 2: has not opted into security features

It was found that user satisfaction (with the overall app) with group 1 was 30% lower than with group 2.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do you think so?** 

**What can we conclude?** 

**Should we recommend eliminating this feature?**

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's quite obvious that there is a huge sampling bias here. The sampling is not random, and there is an inherent bias for people who might opt into security features that will make them less satisfied with a social media app.

**I was told to consider stratified sampling, and I've read up on stratified sampling, but I'm not sure how it really helps us answer the main questions such as ""should we recommend eliminating this feature?""**

## Get Good at Stats and Maths 

It's easy to fall into a state of depression when you don't have the know-how-to of Statistics and Maths when learning Numpy, Pandas or Scikit-learn. I hope that the following resources will help you to start building the Data Science skills required today.

## Learn Statistics for Data Science

A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. As a data scientist student, You can master the core concepts, probability, Bayesian thinking, and even statistical machine learning from best available books or an online course.

## Statistics for Data Science Courses

If you need an introduction to Statistics, start with any of the beginner level course listed below. Try and integrate some of these online courses into your schedule while learning python. You'll feel very confident while learning to work with analytical libraries for Python.

In two of days I have an interview for a position as Data Scientist. I have to admit I am quite nervous because I applied online and thought it was a long shot (I just completed a postgraduate degree in quantitative finance after having worked in sales for a few years so this is all new to me), and surprisingly I was called the next day by HR for a face to face interview.

In the job description they mention a few concepts I am not all too familiar with. Of course I looked some of them up online and did my own research, but I would greatly appreciate it if someone on this subreddit would vulgarise some of these concepts and and maybe underline their implication/importance with regard to data science applied in a business context (marketing analytics in my case). 

The concepts I have highlighted in the job description for which I would like to have an explanation in layman's terms are the following: 

* building of propensity to buy and uplift models
* segmentation, pricing optimisation, next best offer engine
* using test and learn approach to improve marketing campaigns
* operational research
* industrialisation of models in Python and version control
* deployment of experimental design and application of advanced modelling techniques

Additional question: What kind of statistics/math questions should I prepare for with this kind of interview?

Thanks in advance for your help!

I'm torn between 4 electives to take in my program, since we are only given the flexibility for 2. I'm getting tuition reimbursement, so if I took all 4 I would have to cover the extra 2 courses. While I may end up doing that anyway, I thought I'd post and ask what you guys thought was most worthwhile! 

------------------------

Here are my 4 options. What would you take? 

Survival Analysis (3)
This course provides an understanding of both the mathematical theory and practical  applications for the analysis of time to event data with censoring. This includes univariate  analysis, group comparisons, and regression techniques for survival analysis. Parametric and  semi-parametric regression techniques covered will include those with categorical and/or continuous explanatory variables, both with and without interaction effects.

Mathematical Statistics II (3)
This course introduces the fundamentals of statistical estimation and hypothesis testing, including  point and interval estimation, likelihood and sufficiency principles, properties of estimators, loss 
functions, Bayesian analysis, and asymptotic convergence. 

Statistical Learning I (3)
Statistical learning is a fundamental skill for data scientists. Data scientists are specialists in  drinking from the firehose of big data, and statistical learning techniques are some of their  key tools. This course focuses on applications of statistical learning to big data challenges 
through data mining and predictive modeling techniques that are in great demand. Students will be introduced to the basics of statistical/machine learning: supervised learning (e.g. linear model, nonlinear models, penalized methods, ensemble methods, etc.), unsupervised learning (e.g. K means clustering, nearest neighbors, hierarchical clustering, etc.), and missing data in machine learning. Throughout the course, we will learn how to be informed doers, who not only know how to apply methods but understand how those methods work. This understanding can be critical to getting good results from big data, so that the limitations of certain methods are properly understood.

Statistical Learning II (3)
Knowledge of how and when to apply more sophisticated statistical learning models to big data can make a data scientist an indispensable asset to a research team. In Statistical Learning 2, we will learn how to be informed doers. We will learn how many of the covered methods work, in addition to the proper situations to apply them. This is particularly important in this 
course, because these methods are applicable when simpler methods are inappropriate and rarely work well without significant tinkering. Data scientists with mastery of these methods are empowered to investigate questions that are far too complex to answer with the more general workhorse methods covered in the first unit of this series, Statistical Learning 1. We will cover many of the most important techniques in use today, including: mixture models, hidden Markov models, spline regression, support vector machines, advanced discriminant analysis methods, neural networks (including deep learning), and methods for handling highly complex computation, such as Hadoop. The course culminates with a short project that will pull together all the skills you have learned to demonstrate how they can be used for statistical decision support, which is a common task for data scientists.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

`numerator = sum(a*b for a,b in zip(vector2,vector1))`

`denominator = square_rooted(vector1)*square_rooted(vector2)`

Personally I found your response both humbling and invigorating at the same time. Thank You again!

Today, Id like to take a closer look at the overall Journey. Its not that the individual stages are not worth discussing (yet!), but I think we need to spend some time understanding the bigger picture before diving into a lot of details (and some code).

Essentially, what we are saying is that data goes through stages, as represented in the next figure. If starts in its inception (i.e. a telemetry data generated by a sensor), then morphs into a series of increasingly complex data structures and eventually arrives to some decision-making point.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 2vhi4lxsyys11...*

We are calling these three stages:

1. The *Data* *Stage:* the Data has been acquired, its initial format is nothing more than a collection of raw values

* **Example:** A data packet generated by a weather station may look something like **98.91**,**overcast**,**1.25**,**1539725035**

2. The *Knowledge Stage:* the Data is morphed into something that helps a human (or a system) gain *Knowledge* about a particular condition, situation, or event.

* **Example:** that *raw* data packet can be morphed into something like *temperature* = **98.91**, *weather* = **overcast**, *rainfall\_total* = **1.25**, *local\_time* = **Oct 16, 2018 9:23pm****

3. The *Intelligence Stage i*s when Data-turned-into-Knowledge is being used for decision making

* **Example:** avoid that particular area because of potentially bad road conditions.

This is all good, however there is one CRITICAL piece of data that is missing. Any guesses??

Yes, you are rightwe dont know WHERE that particular weather station is! We reached our first decision point only to realize that we can make a better decision, should we get one more piece of data, namely the location of the weather station.

Just to recap initially the Journey seemed relatively straight forward then we realized that we may need to backtrack few steps and relive the Journey from there (again!). In other words, what initially appeared to be a predictable progression from Data to Intelligence turned out to be just another vantage point on a bigger Map. Whats even more intriguing is that our first intelligent decision had a very short life and, even worse, it became a dead end as soon as we realized that there is a better decision to be made. In order to make this kind of rapid adjustments, our initial Journey MAP has to become a lot more iterative to the point that we are now start creating dependencies between stages (aka feedback loops).

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b7ehis4vyys11.png

As shown in the figure above, there may be times when we need to go from the *Intelligence Stage* back to the *Knowledge Stage* and see if we can collect additional pieces of *Knowledge* that we might had missed the first time. If that attempt yields no results, then we need to go all the way back to the *Data Stage* and see if we can gather more *Data*. In our example, this would amount to inquiring the weather station (i.e. via an API call) to reveal its geo-location, namely its latitude and longitude.

This all may sound like boilerplate, however I hope we can all agree that this thought process helps us establish a structure that we can then use to map out our Data Journey. Knowing exactly where you are in your Data Journey, what lies ahead of you and what places you may need to revisit are all highly acclaimed skills that we all need to master.

One last point before closing from a more practical point of view it should be noted that there is a cost associated with all these iterations. Having to go back and forth to gather more data, train the model(s) a little more, etc. cost time, money and resources. It also adds complexity. All these incremental costs add up quickly to the point that incurred costs exceed the actual value gained from this exercise. Sometimes *Perfect* DOES get in the way of *Good*! Dont let that happen to you!

Thats all for today! In the next articles we will dive deeper into each of the stages and look at the Data from different perspectives: Consumer, Producer, Insider, Observer, and so on.

That said, I want to leave you today with one question that hopefully you will find it just as intriguing as I do: lets say YOU ARE that one text message that your cellphone just sent out. What the World would look like to You?

Until next time, all the best! Talk to you soon!",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I come up with how to do stuff, and then sometimes I feel like I pick the hardest ways to do things. Maybe it's because I'm a beginner. I've only been spending time with it for 3 months. (undergrad Math- barely passed programming courses)

I wanted to go to graduate school for an MEng in Computer Engineering with specialization in Hardware. I was always interested in technology. (Gadgets, like I don't even need a phone or laptop, but I keep watching youtube reviews of different new tech) I'm glad I changed my mind before getting into Hardware though, because that is not the same as liking toys!

I was accepted to a MEng - computer Engineering : Artificial Intelligence &amp; Robotics program. It was expensive and the commute was way too long so I didn't go. (also like ranked 2000 world wide) 

Then I came up with this: I know some programming and a lot of math ---&gt; I should get into Industrial Engineering. Because most software engineers know too much coding and not enough Math/Statistics/Analytics and too many Industrial Engineers know Optimization/Statistics but not enough Math/Programming. So I am right in the middle of these two, which is Data Science (but is is it?). I do know Stats and Programming and A LOT of Math. (Linear Algebra, Topology, Analytics, OR)

I felt like this is a good place to be. I've started my MSc in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering for about a month now. I would have liked to have more computer/software related classes. I know it's stupid, but I really want to be a programmer - it's just that seeing most of the CS students at school was disheartening. About 90% of them knew a programming language before getting into CS, and a lot of them had started at age 12. So I felt like I could never catch up, I still do. I worry that if I go for a software degree, everyone will be a better programmer than me and I will spend most of my time playing catch up! 

I'm just wondering, am I being stupid to think that DS is the best fit for someone like me? I did finish the datacamp career track, and I did like a lot of it (it was at times boring). I just don't see any sort of ""Supervised/Unsupervised/Machine"" learning classes being offered to ISE students. We have to take a lot of optimization, Analytical classes (Econometric, Dynamic Systems, Decision Theory, Fuzzy Sets/Logic). It's a much better school than the other one I got into (this one is ranked #1 in the country), but I still am unsure. 

Also, say I finish the 2 year master. I really want to do a PhD. It's been a goal of mine, and I know it's not needed but I really need it. Should I look for Operation Research programs? Systems Engineering? Data Science? Maybe even take a look at Statistics or Mathematics? Maybe even something more business related : Management? I know computer science will be a bit too much for me. 

I am very confused, and feel like I can do anything and I want to do all of them but don't have time. I'm currently teaching myself Python and trying to use it in any/all homeworks I can. I'm also studying up for ML/DL/ANN and trying to find papers to come up with a research proposal that fits my areas of interest best that I can actually do for my thesis. But I just need to know that I'm doing the right thing. 

I will also try to build a DS potfolio (doing some of the simpler titanic and Iris data sets) and maybe Kaggle competitions as well as school projects so I can apply for internships in the summer. It's a MSc degree, so I have to take all my classes this year and then all of next year is devoted to my thesis. I appreciate your help.

* [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) + [hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) + [MagicPython](https://atom.io/packages/MagicPython) for interactive code execution and instanty seeing plots, dataframes and more,
* Sync Atom with PyCharm via [file-watcher](https://atom.io/packages/file-watcher) (but first [disable PyCharm safe write](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools/blob/master/atom.md#useful-atom-packages)),
* With this combo you also may need to [reload imported custom external modules in Hydrogen](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools/blob/master/tips.md#reload-imported-modules-in-hydrogen),
* Write Unicode fast in Atom via [sugartex-completions](https://atom.io/packages/sugartex-completions) or [latex-completions](https://atom.io/packages/latex-completions),
* Export Hydrogen document to static Markdown document or Jupyter notebook via [Pandoctools](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools) based on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (or export to PDF but this unfortunately needs tuning...),
* During export via Pandoctools use any pandoc or text filter like [pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref) (so you can have cross-references for equations, figures and tables), [SugarTeX](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/sugartex) LaTeX transpiler or a custom filter via [panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute),
* Pandoctools stores [reusable profiles](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools/tree/master/pandoctools/cli) that define text conversion (written as bash/batch pipeline with CLI text filters),

So let's say Company A wants to better understand its customers to tailor targeting them on social media and also to understand who to target to acquire new customers. But you have limited information about the customers from business A (maybe address, age and gender). No real individual level information, right? Presumably you want to know more characteristics to ""chuck into a model"". So what now?

How do you use social media to find that information on people that would be best to target given that there is no individual level information company A to gain from social media platforms either (i.e. Facebook tells you how many views, how many likes etc but does not tell you by which people and what they have in common). Do you make code to analyse information on social media posts (is that legal?) or just buy anonymised data and use that to match with the limited information you have on your customer list.

Im new to Data Analysis and trying to wrap my head around this concept. Would appreciate someone even giving me a high-level overview or pointing me in the right direction!!  I hope this question makes sense.

I am a data science newbie, I know some pandas and numpy (not proficient by any means).

I've been tasked with extracting JIRA data across teams and find correlations in the workflows across different teams specific to QA and devs. There are 4 dev teams but only 1 QA team. I have already pulled the data and massaged the data. 

I'm not sure where to begin or what questions I am trying to answer. 

I am thinking about checking correlation between description length and story points, how often issues get passed back from QA to devs (this would indirectly tell us about the # of bugs), who is writing the tickets, who is being assigned the ticket, who is being assigned to test the ticket, how much time is there between each transition, how long does it take to resolve an issue....

I feel as if I don't have a direction, I'm just trying to find a needle in a haystack. I know how to generate heatmaps, bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots in pandas, but again, this is trivial compared to the thought that must go into how one wants to display the data and what questions they are trying to answer.

&gt; After Trump took office, DJ Patil watched with wonder as the data disappeared across the federal government. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior removed from their websites the links to climate change data. The USDA removed the inspection reports of businesses accused of animal abuse by the government. The new acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, said he wanted to end public access to records of consumer complaints against financial institutions. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, statistics that detailed access to drinking water and electricity in Puerto Rico were deleted from the FEMA website. In a piece for FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher pointed out that the first annual crime report released by the FBI under Trump was missing nearly three-quarters of the data tables from the previous year. Among the data missing from the 2016 report is information on arrests, the circumstances of homicides (such as the relationships between victims and perpetrators), and the only national estimate of annual gang murders, they wrote. Trump said he wanted to focus on violent crime, and yet was removing the most powerful tool for understanding it.
&gt; 
&gt; And as for the countrys first chief data scientistwell, the Trump administration did not show the slightest interest in him. I basically knew that these guys werent going to listen to us, said DJ, so we created these exit memos. The memos showed that this stuff pays for itself a thousand times over. He hoped the memos might give the incoming administration a sense of just how much was left to be discovered in the information the government had collected. There were questions crying out for answers: for instance, what was causing the boom in traffic fatalities? The Department of Transportation had giant pools of data waiting to be searched. One hundred Americans were dying every day in car crashes. The thirty-year trend of declining traffic deaths has reversed itself dramatically. We dont really know whats going on, said DJ. Distracted driving? Heavier cars? Faster driving? More driving? Bike lanes?
&gt; 
&gt; The knowledge to be discovered in government data might shift the odds in much of American life. You could study the vaccination data, for instance, and create heat maps for disease. If you could randomly drop someone with measles somewhere in the United States, where would you have the biggest risk of an epidemic? said DJ. Where are epidemics waiting to happen? These questions, when you have access to data, you can do things. Everyone is focused on how data is a weapon. Actually, if we dont have data, were screwed.
&gt; 
&gt; His memos were never read, DJ suspects. At any rate, hes never heard a peep about them.

I have another MA degree in political philosophy and five years experience in social policy analysis. My quant. skills and programming (R, and minimal Python) are self-taught, but I expect that the two year survey stats programme will help me equip with the necessary quant. skills. The programme consists of some math subjects (linalg, analysis, probability), statistics, and some programming (R, Python).

Recently a researcher from a well-reputed research company in our region came into our class and invited the students to participate in a research project, where they would analyse non-response rates in household surveys. They say there is plenty of opportunity for research in the project because they have a huge database, and we could of course use that for our thesis as well.

I like the idea, but my only concern is that I went into this programme with the goal so that I can transition from qualitative research into data science, and I am not sure how much such an internship and thesis would predestine my career opportunities. I already know, for example, that I would not like to work for the Statistical Office or a similar public agency in the future. (I am currently a researcher at a public research institute, and as much as I like research, I find the work-morale is horrible and stifling.) My dream is to freelance as a data analyst, or work for a private company where I can keep learning new things and which pays well.

On stats forums what I usually see with regard to switching to DS is that allegedly it can be relatively easily done, and the most important part of DS is math/stats anyway. There is also some tendency to present DS as something that is still evolving, multifaceted (and perhaps a bit over-hyped). In our programme, we are being told the same, and that irrespective of all the fuss about big data and stuff, the foundation of ""all of it"" is survey statistics (they say so:-).

So I was wondering what do ppl who actually work in the field thing about this? Would you agree that if someone has a solid understanding of math/stats they can easily switch to DS?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Over the past few months Ive been teaching myself SQL and Python through a variety of MOOCs plus DataCamp, and just started the Andrew NG Machine Learning Coursera course.  These all seem very good and Im learning a lot, but looking for any specific strategies to really cement the concepts Im learning.

Ive got an engineering bachelors and a ops management masters.  Ive spent the last 12 years working as an engineer for the same company, and learned quite a bit of basic data analysis techniques as part of that job (Excel, MiniTab,  and various query building software that uses SQL in the background.)

I recently started seeing some places where I believe machine learning and some other data science tools could benefit the company, and pitched them to a couple managers.  Now Ive got about 3 months to transition into a data analyst role where Ill be responsible for implementing them (among other things).

I dont believe I oversold my current abilities, but they are trusting me to learn some of these tools pretty quickly and if I can do that, the process and product knowledge I have should be a pretty big asset.

So, assuming I continue on with the online learning, what are some strategies I can use to actually become proficient?  Any suggestions on how to keep it interesting as well?  Currently Ive been doing most of my research and learning outside of work and am enjoying most of it, but if it ever becomes a slog its going to be difficult to motivate myself to do it in my free time...

 **Introduction**

All data comes within a particular context and often as a result of a specific question being asked. All is well until we try to use the same data to answer a different question in a different context. When combining an existing data set with a new question, you must ask whether the original context in which the data was collected is compatible with the new question and the new context. If there is context compatibility, it is usually reasonable to move on. If not then you should stop or propose some principle or statistical assumption that makes the two contexts compatible. Good data analysts often do this quickly and may not even realize they are doing it. However, I believe that the explicit recognition of this task is important to ensure that data analyzes can provide clear answers and useful conclusions.

Understanding context compatibility is increasingly important as data science and analysis of existing data sets continue to take off. All existing data sets come from somewhere and it is important that the analyst knows where it is and if it is compatible with where it is going. If there is an incompatibility between the two contexts, which in my experience is almost always the case, then any assumption or statistical principle invoked will probably introduce uncertainty in the final results. This uncertainty should be communicated at least to the public, if not formally considered in the analysis. In some cases, the original context of the data and the context of the new analysis will be so incompatible that it is not worth using the data to answer the new question. The explicit recognition of this problem can save a great deal of wasted time by analyzing a set of data that, in the end, is not adequate to answer a given question.

**I wanted to provide two examples of my own work where context compatibility played an important role.**

**Example: Data Link and Spatial Misalignment**

Data on air pollution tend to be collected on monitors, which can reasonably be regarded as location points. Air pollution data collected by the US EPA. They are collected primarily to monitor compliance with regulations. The idea here (roughly) is that we do not want any part of a county or state to be above a certain threshold of air pollution, so we strategically place the monitors in certain locations and monitor their values against the quality standards of the Air monitors can provide representative measurements of air pollution levels in the general area around the monitor, but their level of representation depends on the measurement of the specific pollutant and the nature of the sources of contamination in the area. Ultimately, for compliance monitoring, it really does not really matter how monitors are representative, because overshooting in one location is still a problem (regulations have ways of smoothing large transient values).

Health data tends to be measured at the aggregate level, particularly when it comes from administrative sources. We could know the daily counts of deaths or hospitalizations in a county or province or zip code. It is not possible to link health data with air pollution data due to a context mismatch: health data are measured locally (counts of people living within some political boundary) and the pollution data is measured at point locations , so there is an incompatibility in the spatial measurement scale. We can only link them to data sources by doing one of the following:

1. Assume that monitor values are representative of population exposure throughout the county.

2. Develop a model that can predict pollution levels at all points in the county and then average those values as representative of county average levels.

This problem is well known in spatial statistics and is known as spatial misalignment or as a support change. The misalignment of pollution and health data is the mismatch of context here and arises due to the different measurement schemes that we use for each type of data. As a result, we must invoke an assumption or a statistical model to link the two.

The representatives assumption is easier to do because it does not require additional work, but may introduce unknown uncertainties in the problem if the pollution values are not representative of the population exposure. If a pollutant is regional in nature and is spatially homogeneous, the assumption may be reasonable. But if there are many sources of hyper local contamination that introduce spatial heterogeneity, the hypothesis will not be valid. The statistical modelling approach is more practical, but it is simple (in principle) and may offer the ability to explicitly characterize the uncertainty introduced by modelling. In both cases, there is a statistical price to pay for binding data sets.

Data binding is a common place to find context discrepancies, since different sets of data are rarely collected with the other data sets in mind. Therefore, careful attention should be given to the contexts in which each set of data was collected and which assumptions or models should be made more to achieve context compatibility.

**Example: the GAM crisis**

A common way of investigating acute or short-term associations between air pollution levels and health outcomes is through time series analysis. The general idea is that it adopts a temporary series of air pollution levels, usually from an EPA monitor, and then relates it to a time series of some health outcome (usually death) in a population of interest. The difficult part, of course, is to adjust to the variety of factors that may confuse the relationship between air pollution and health outcomes. Although some factors can be measured and adjusted directly (eg, temperature, humidity), others are not measured and we need to find a reasonable power to adjust them.

In the late 1990s, researchers began to use generalized additive models to explain temporary unmeasured confounding factors in time series models of air pollution. With the GAMs, it could include soft-time functions in itself to be able to adjust any variable time factor that might confuse the relationship between air pollution and health. It was not a perfect solution, but it was a reasonable and highly flexible solution. It did not hurt that there was already a good implementation of S-PLUS software that could be easily executed with existing data. By the year 2000, most researchers had standardized the use of the GAM approach in time series of air pollution studies.

In 2002, researchers at Johns Hopkins discovered a problem with GAM software with respect to the predetermined convergence criterion. The problem was that the predetermined convergence criterion used to determine whether the tuning algorithm used to fit the model had converged was set to 0.0001, which for most GAM applications was more than sufficient. The typical application of GAM was to smooth the dispersion to observe possible non-linearity in the relationship between the result and a predictor. However, in models where non-parametric terms were highly correlated (a situation called ""concurrency""), the predetermined criterion was not sufficiently rigorous. It turns out that simultaneity is quite common in time series models and the end result is that most models published in the literature on air pollution did not converge in the adaptation process.

By this time, the US EPA was reviewing the evidence from time series studies and asked researchers who published most studies to redo their analyzes using alternative approaches (including using more stringent convergence criteria). In summary, many of the published risk estimates were reduced by about 40%, but the overall story remained the same. There was still strong evidence of an association between air pollution and health, the effect was not as great as we thought. Francesca Dominici wrote a complete autopsy of the saga that contains many more details.

The underlying problem here was an undetected change in context against the GAM software. In the previous use of GAM, the predetermined convergence criterion was probably good because there were no strong dependencies between the various mild components of the model and the relationships being modeled had no time-series characteristics. However, when the same GAM software was used in a totally different context, one that the original authors probably did not predict, suddenly the same convergence criterion was inadequate. The low competition environment of previous GAM analyzes was inconsistent with the high competition environment of time series analysis of air pollution. The lesson here is that software used in a context other than what was developed is essentially new software. And like all new software, it requires testing and validation.

**Summary**

It is important to recognize context changes because they can determine whether the analyzes you are performing are valid or not. They are particularly important to discuss in data science applications, often the data are pre-existing but are being applied to a new problem or issue. Methodologies and analytical approaches that are completely reasonable in one context may be inappropriate or even incorrect in a different context. Finally, any assumption or model applied to achieve context compatibility can have an effect on the final results, usually in the form of greater uncertainty. These additional uncertainties should not be overlooked at the end, but should be communicated to the public or formally incorporated into the analysis.

The guy before me implemented Tableau Server as part of the data pipeline and I maintain it through upgrades, configuring it and use it to connect with datasources and create visualisations.

My gripe with this program is that it's very expensive in terms of licensing fees and hardware resources it consumes. To create around 100 reports daily, it constantly uses around 32 GB Memory and 8 CPU cores. A lot of these reports are no more complex than a simple SELECT statement with a normal sized database that's indexed just fine (read: very basic stuff) . 

I have tried a lot of tweaking with memory cache settings, having the SQL servers I connect with doing all of any aggregations, limiting the amount of data sources per dashboard, limiting the amount of filters I use and basically keeping resource use as low as possible. 

This is fine up to a point but we will be migrating from the on premise server Tableau is sitting on to a cloud solution and I'm really not looking forward to the costs then. Put simply, I think Tableau is a huge memory hog for the simple tricks it performs. I like the ease of use it gives me but it's just looking to be too costly to maintain.

So who's in the same boat? How do you deal in your organization? Do you work with custom scripts written in Jupyter Notebook with ggplot2, RStudio with Shiny? D3.JS? That seems sufficient in most cases purely for creating visualizations but I think it would create a barrier for entry to future colleagues who might need to learn a new skillset whereas Tableau is easy to use. Am I overlooking reasons not to pick a free solution? It's not much of an issue that alternatives are less user-friendly for users than Tableau. My users are mostly happy with just the graphs or they receive CSV exports so they can drilldown themselves. There's not any need for a user to fumble with Python or anything and I don't see that as a big disadvantage for using more Python scripts as a solution.

During the last years, I have been part of a fascinating research and work area including Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and most recently in the Oil&amp;Gas Digital Transformation. Directly or indirectly I have been involved in the AI discussion, and I decided to write this post with some of my thoughts about the challenges and opportunities that modern AI/ML advances offer. This post focuses on the challenges and social opportunities carried by modern AI advancements, and is divided into three parts, the first one about my current perception of working in the AI development field, the second part summarising my opinion about creating and scaling AI projects/companies and finally, the third part, covering some of the opportunities offered by AI industry to reshape our society.

&amp;#x200B;

We are living exciting times in AI development, and for the first time in history, it is possible to build AI systems with significant impacts in multiple economic sectors (e.g. Retail, Insurance, Agriculture, Manufacture, Oil&amp;gas, among others). I intentionally claim ""for the first time in history"" because as you probably know recent AI advances are built on top of methods a couple of decades old. However, it is the first time that we can easily access enough computational power and collect large enough data to use these methods and detonate real benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

With existing technologies, it is now possible to create a scalable and replicable framework to mature AI systems and companies. This framework is not necessarily the same traditionally used to grow and develop technology projects. Maturing, scaling, and monetising AI indeed requires very particular skills, technologies, and professional experience and Ignoring these necessities would potentially risk the success of many AI projects and business strategies. If you or your company is embracing AI development be prepared to give the required importance to your data, be ready to create or outsource positions that didnt exist a couple of years ago such as Data Labelers, AI DevOps, and be open to trying different computing strategies (e.g. Distributed Computing, GPUs, Tensor Units, among others).

&amp;#x200B;

While surfing the internet, you would probably find plenty of articles about scaring scenarios of AI and their impacts on the workforce. In a less dramatic opinion, I firmly believe that AI development, more than a risk, constitutes an excellent social innovation opportunity to reshape our society around this emerging technologies but we must prepare our young talent and our educational system to be part of a sustainable AI development. I would say that AI ideas are growing faster than the expertise required to make them real and It is the responsibility of the experienced researchers and practitioners to educate for a sustainable and lastly AI capable society. It is in our hands to work hard to mature AI ideas adequately, I cannot see a coming AI winter soon, but we must work daily to avoid it.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I am convinced that Artificial Intelligence will touch every industry to some degree, but each of them must find and design his own AI strategy and roadmap. For example, think about a retail sector with much more powerful recommender systems, the insurance sector with more precise risks estimations and individualisation, or even more traditional areas such as oil&amp;gas, taking advantage of millions of sensors combined with modern AI systems to optimize their operations. We are living exciting times, and the future is bright for everybody willing to play a role in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you find interesting my opinion about current AI impacts and opportunities. I would like to know your ideas and comments. I will try to find some time in the following weeks to expand some of the ideas here described with more actionable insights. If someone is willing to cooperate with this writings just let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** *This article is inspired by a recent conversation with Andrew Ng, whom I consider the most influential leader in AI development. The article contains my opinion of non-technical AI challenges and opportunities, but I find inspiring to know that leaders like Andrew are working hard to create a sustainable AI industry in every single aspect here described.*

I personally am skeptical every time people talk about insights, being data-driven and other buzzwords. It hasnt been my experience that people will look at data and act on it as intended. I lean more towards creating systems that automatically update/change your products based on the data itself (removing the human decision middle layer) since most decisions that managers believe they need to make can be abstracted away in code anyway.

However, at my place theres been a push to use Tableau to democratize data, whatever that means. But with a company of 400+ people and a data team of 20+, even after 1.5 years nobody has even seen a dashboard yet. Licenses havent been sorted out, no training has been carried out, its just very unclear whats happening. 

Ive explored tools like Periscope Data, Google Data Studio, etc which one person on his/her own could spin up in a week but have been told many times to not do that and that Tableau will be the all-encompassing solution to our data needs.

Long story short, new manager in the company, 0 technical knowledge. She is more ""consulting"" than ""developing"". Nice person, not a problem at that level. 

The problem is more formal: as she does not understand whats behind the development of a tool/solution (I have a small team that works end to end, from data ingestion to front end and dashboards). New Manager changes specifications on the fly, asks for super complex things that require weeks or months of work (""can we see something tomorrow?"") and expects to see ""something"" fully operative first, and then decide if we commit. 

I started sharing with her the planning, backlogs and estimated time of development for every thing she asks. Of course, she does not like what she sees, and projects are being cancelled because we cannot deliver in 1/10th of the realistic time. 

Her new strategy to force us (!) to deliver is now this: she defines the concept, involves 10, 20, 30 people in long emails and skype calls, makes promises regarding features and deadlines... AFTER THAT, she approaches me and my team and informs us.

She is under very high pressure to deliver stuff to her also non technical Sr Managers and Directors, I get that, but in this scenario I am the guy saying no every day (MANY times a day!), and I dont like that.

In addition to this, it appears to be very hard to get client's to trust you about what you can do for them with ML and you end up in a chicken + egg problem (Show me what you can do -&gt; we can't because we don't have your data yet -&gt; I won't give you my data until you show me what you can do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my third year of bachelor software engineering and am following a bigdata semester(data science/engineering, hadoop, ML, AI using R or Python). I'm asking for your help as I can't come up with a good research question to base my next assignment around. Maybe you guys can guide me in the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll have to answer my research question using a bigdata set(100000000+ entries), a modern framework such as tensorflow/keras/Spark MLib/etc.. and have it all stored in a NoSQL db(We're currently learning hadoop/spark so I'll probably use that aswell). I also need to create a interactive visualization of the data(filter,sort,click through, probably the least work)

&amp;#x200B;

I tried googling for some public datasets but am having a hard time thinking of an interesting research question. I've also found old kaggle competitions(such as taxi fare prediction) but these barely hit 100M entries.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Any ideas for a research question for a dataset that has 100M+ entries combined with ML/AI?

Im a python guy and do most of my development in Visual Studio Code. I like the user interface and it suits my needs for getting stuff done quick. I also love the concept of interactive blocks of code with Jupyter Notebooks, and the power it gives you to prototype and explore, share and collaborate.  

However, in my experience with R (that candidly isnt super extensive) I cant help but be impressed by the R Studio capabilities. The ability to review data used in the code, understand values and functions, and generally get a lay of the land with the code your writing seems far superior to what is out there with python IDEs. 

My question is, am I missing something thats out on the market for python which gives the same great functionality of R Studio? I guess when I heard about Jupyter Lab I assumed it would have some of this functionality but in my brief experience it doesnt seem to.

Here is the concrete problem I'm trying to solve:

I am a coach for a large team of independent salespeople (i.e. they set their own work schedule). My job is to help them perform, encourage them and keep them motivated. Having a large group of people to look over, I simply do not have the time needed to give thorough personalized attention to each one of them. I am looking to build a tool (I program in JavaScript) that could help me pinpoint the individuals that are in need of my immediate and focused attention. I'm thinking that I could use past data to help me with that.

The difficulty I'm having is in identifying individuals that are really starting to struggle and are about to fall off the deep-end in terms of productivity with individuals that are simply having a mild momentary slump or are being affected by some seasonal factors. I have monthly data going back a few years for all of my salespeople and although I have data on amount and number of sales, for this tool I want to focus on hours worked as I find it is the factor over which a salesperson has the most control over and is a good indicator of how motivated they are.

I'm hoping that I can build a tool that will allow me to start working with a salesperson in need of help before they get too down and unmotivated, because once they reach a certain level, it is really hard to pick them back up. What I want to be able to do is help out the salesperson that has the habit of working 120 hours a month and starts to struggle with motivation BEFORE he slips down and settles into the habit of now working 40 hours a month. It's important that I try to avoid false positives as much as possible. Eg.: A salesperson logs in significantly less hours this month compared to last month... because he took two weeks vacation or because our offices were closed one week for Christmas or because he just didn't feel like it this month but it's just a momentary funk and he'll be right back to his old self next month, without my involvement.

My data is bounded in the sense that a salesperson cannot work less than 0 hours per month and it is physically impossible for them to work more than (31 days X 24 hours) 744 hours per month. In that sense it is different from other data sets such as stock prices which technically have no ceiling and I'm guessing that this difference probably means that I can't use the same kinds of tools or models to analyse and forecast my data.

So given my problem and available data, what statistical tool, model or technique should I use to detect and identify those individuals that are most in need of my immediate focus and attention? I'm looking to program this tool using JavaScript so feel free to suggest any compatible libraries or framework that could be useful in implementing your suggestions. Also, although my knowledge of machine learning and statistics does not run too deep, I am interested in the field and I'm not afraid to get a little dirty and having to learn new things. That being said, if there is a simple tool, technique or heuristic that could be used to great effect, I would favor that. I'm not looking for 99% accuracy, I'm looking for any solution that would consistently be better than pin the tail on the donkey.",30,1,False,self,,,,,

I graduated from a stats program in May and did a great ds fellowship during the summer. During the fellowship I got offered a startup ds job that looked great on paper, and being the insecure inexperienced grad that I am I took the job right away. The nightmare started therethe startup kept changing the location, going from my home city (where they originally posted for) to somewhere else in US to some where in Europe to somewhere in Northern Europe. Already dealing with international student on OPT restriction I still accepted all their last minutes changes and boarded a plane to the last place they told me to. After working with them for two weeks with no office space (literally worked at coffee shop for the most part), no compensation for travel/no phone service, no concrete plans to actually pay me, let alone any insurance and health benefits, I informed them about the worry I have in regards to my international status (which they are aware of). They terminated me the next day saying my status would be too much of a burden for both me and them. I did like the work there and did some cool dimensionality reduction and clustering work that I want to put on my resume, but Im not sure if the whole hassle is worth explaining for. Thoughts?

First and foremost, Im considering a transition to data science from my current role of business systems analyst for one of the big banks in the US. So Im taking stock in professional guidance. This will be a semi long post about a conversation I had with my mentor that I found somewhat disappointing. However he has a tendency to over embellish his own expertise but here I truly dont know if he is or not. 

He made a couple statements that dont follow the sentiments I have read in various articles and this forum. 

1. That data science is only used in R&amp;D. In my albeit limited understanding I had assumed you could use DS for for product analysis (existing and future), product based process refinement,  increase overall efficiency as well as R&amp;D and the more scientific avenues of the field. 

2. A masters degree in general severely limits my choices insofar as all entry level positions for anything are now off the table. And I will be looked over because I would be considered over qualified. 
Which concerns me as I tread through my mid career crisis lol. 

3. There are limited companies that are using DS in my area right now. (roughly 5 companies)   I live in Maine.
And as time passes no new DS jobs are likely to open as the field will turn my serviced based / consulting heavy. (Aka here someone to come in, run your data, provide results and collect the check). And at first I shot the idea down but I have to believe theres only so many issues to be solved by data. For any company... but again I have no idea. 

Now tomorrow I was supposed to meet with our leader of emerging technologies to talk about how our company is using AI, ML AND DS on a day to day basis and I find my resolve and confidence (what little I have talking to leaders) shot. 

Am I being naive in my thinking of the field, in the very general senses I provided above?

Thanks for reading and responding if you do - please be nice, I dont claim to know anything for sure, Im asking as a second option.

Outliers are patterns in data that do not confirm to the expected behavior. While detecting such patterns are of prime importance in Credit Card Fraud, Stock Trading etc. Detecting anomaly or outlier observations are also of importance when training any of the supervised machine learning models. This brings us to two very important questions: concept of a local outlier, and why a local outlier?

In a multivariate dataset where the rows are generated independently from a probability distribution, only using centroid of the data might not alone be sufficient to tag all the outliers. Measures like Mahalanobis distance might be able to identify extreme observations but wont be able to label all possible outlier observations. The local outlier factor is a density-based outlier detection method derived from DBSCAN; the intuition behind the approach is that the density around an outlier object will be significantly different from the density around its neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7ci48x8l4bu11.jpg

In the figure above, the red dot (C) indicates the center of the data; a distance-based method will only be able to identify o3 and o4 as the outliers, while in reality o3 is an outlier while o4 is not. Also, o1 and o2 are two outlier observations, considering the local neighborhood while based on global data distribution; they are not classified as outliers. 

Local outlier factor is a density-based method that relies on k-nearest neighbors. The LOF method scores each data point by computing the ratio of the average of densities of the neighbors to the density of point itself. The steps involved in computing the LOF are as below:

 Calculate distance between the pair of observations. 

 Find the kth nearest neighbor observation; calculate the distance between the observation and k-Nearest neighbor.

 Calculate Local Reachability Density (LRD): LRD is the most optimal distance in any direction from the neighbor to the individual point. Mathematically its the count of items in ks nearest neighbor set divided by the max of the kth nearest neighbor of the point and the distance between the point and its adjoining point. The distance is referred as reach distance. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l3c2jjam4bu11.png

 Local Outlier Factor(LOF) as defined above will be the ratio of local reachability of o and os k-nearest neighbors

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/9ex93qdn4bu11.png

 The lower is the local reachability of o and the higher the reachability of k nearest neighbors of o higher the LOF. 

The LOF value of less than 1 is an indicator that the observation is not an outlier, while a value greater than 1 indicates an outlier. The cut-off can be higher if the data is sparse. 

R and python both have implementation of LOF. In R the technique can be implemented using the packages DmWR and Rlof (parallel implementation).  Scikit learn in python has the implementation of the algorithm. Below is an illustrative example of LOF technique on a simulated dataset.

Disadvantage of LOF:

 Scalability is a big issue as the computations are memory-intensive and hence, a good computing infrastructure is required for bigger datasets

 The user needs to provide the input k, this input might not be optimal giving incorrect results

Advancements to overcome the disadvantages:

The drawbacks of LOF can be overcome using the some of the latest advancements in algorithms and spark- and Hadoop-based infrastructure. Below are some algorithms that can be looked into from a scalability perspective:

 Scalable Top-n local outlier detection: Uses pruning to eliminate most points from the set of potential outlier candidates without computing LOF or even calculating k nearest neighbors.

While detecting such patterns are of prime importance in Credit Card Fraud, Stock Trading etc. Detecting anomaly or outlier observations are also of importance when training any of the supervised machine learning models. This brings us to two very important questions: concept of a local outlier, and why a local outlier?

In a multivariate dataset where the rows are generated independently from a probability distribution, only using centroid of the data might not alone be sufficient to tag all the outliers. Measures like Mahalanobis distance might be able to identify extreme observations but wont be able to label all possible outlier observations. The local outlier factor is a density-based outlier detection method derived from DBSCAN; the intuition behind the approach is that the density around an outlier object will be significantly different from the density around its neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/s7mvvra28bu11.jpg

In the figure above, the red dot (C) indicates the center of the data; a distance-based method will only be able to identify o3 and o4 as the outliers, while in reality o3 is an outlier while o4 is not. Also, o1 and o2 are two outlier observations, considering the local neighborhood while based on global data distribution; they are not classified as outliers. 

Local outlier factor is a density-based method that relies on k-nearest neighbors. The LOF method scores each data point by computing the ratio of the average of densities of the neighbors to the density of point itself. The steps involved in computing the LOF are as below:

 Calculate distance between the pair of observations. 

 Find the kth nearest neighbor observation; calculate the distance between the observation and k-Nearest neighbor.

 Calculate Local Reachability Density (LRD): LRD is the most optimal distance in any direction from the neighbor to the individual point. Mathematically its the count of items in ks nearest neighbor set divided by the max of the kth nearest neighbor of the point and the distance between the point and its adjoining point. The distance is referred as reach distance. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/rvr50s238bu11.png

 Local Outlier Factor(LOF) as defined above will be the ratio of local reachability of o and os k-nearest neighbors

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/z6y4kmv38bu11.png

 The lower is the local reachability of o and the higher the reachability of k nearest neighbors of o higher the LOF. 

The LOF value of less than 1 is an indicator that the observation is not an outlier, while a value greater than 1 indicates an outlier. The cut-off can be higher if the data is sparse. 

R and python both have implementation of LOF. In R the technique can be implemented using the packages DmWR and Rlof (parallel implementation).  Scikit learn in python has the implementation of the algorithm. Below is an illustrative example of LOF technique on a simulated dataset.

https://i.redd.it/vwabbyqd8bu11.jpg

Disadvantage of LOF:

 Scalability is a big issue as the computations are memory-intensive and hence, a good computing infrastructure is required for bigger datasets

 The user needs to provide the input k, this input might not be optimal giving incorrect results

Advancements to overcome the disadvantages:

The drawbacks of LOF can be overcome using the some of the latest advancements in algorithms and spark- and Hadoop-based infrastructure. Below are some algorithms that can be looked into from a scalability perspective:

I am looking for ways to accelerate my learning curve. As a junior as can be Data Analyst (this position is a stepping stone for a future career in data science) on the job I need to be able to accelerate my learning. I am pretty capable at writing SQL scripts to query my data but where I suffer from is a lack of experience conducting data analysis using Python.

&amp;#x200B;

 I read about a concept of Meta-Learning from the book (The 4 Hour Chef - I swear this book is about learning as opposed to cooking) and it had me thinking and I wanted to reach out to all the experts here on this sub-reddit to answer a few of my questions

&amp;#x200B;

If you were to coach me to conduct high level data analysis for a company or say a kaggle competition but you only had 20% of the ideal time you think is necessary for me to acquire these skills what would you have me focus on :

1. What are the minimum learning units that you would have me hyper focused on?
2. Within those learning units, which are the top 20% that would yield me 80% of the return? (i.e. what parts of the pandas module would I be using 80% of my time)
3. And lastly, in what order should I learn them?

Hope I can get some great advice from this community. I am super hungry and I cant wait to level up in my skills

Before we get started I wanted to say that Im absolutely impressed by the questions and comments that the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9mj2en/the_data_journey_from_data_to_knowledge_to/) and [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9par5d/from_data_to_knowledge_to_intelligence_part_one/) articles in this series generated. All your feedback seems to indicate that, in spite of all the hype around Big Data, understanding fundamental concepts like data lifecycle, insights, true value of data and so on is still a challenge. Few comments indicate that the complexity is to blame. Steve Jobs [once said](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/steve_jobs_416929), Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.

Getting our thinking clean is one of the reasons that led me to do this series.

Today well dive into the first part of the Journey, the Data. Lets start by agreeing that Data is everything. You and I are Data. Our own DNA is a treasure trove of data. Data is both Form and Function. Data has a Life of its own.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0w78wo2d3lu11.png

You probably remember that I ended the [last article](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9par5d/from_data_to_knowledge_to_intelligence_part_one/) with a question: What the world would look like to you if you were to be that ONE text message that your cell phone just sent out?. My intent was to get you to think what the world would look like to a text message. Or to a banking transaction record? Or to a picture someone just posted on Instagram?

This quick experiment leads us to realize that approaching Data from inside out can greatly reduce the dimensionality of the external universe, especially when it comes to gathering and analyzing Data. It is like peeking through a keyhole, except that you and I are \*inside\* the Data (room). This is all good, however does this imaginary experiment have any merit in the real world? Fortunately, Einsteins famous [imaginary elevator](http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/equivalence_principle.html) taught us that we can learn about reality just by thinking and then use Data to vet out our newly acquired knowledge!

In conclusion, taking an Insider approach to understanding Data greatly simplifies the problem domain. The immediate benefit is that models become easier to train, variability is greatly reduced and the noise level goes way down. I hope we can all agree that is a good starting point for our exploration. The ability to map out our journey in small (byte-sized) quantities and in a highly predicable fashion was exactly what we were looking for.

As a quick side note, its worth mentioning that this Insider approach to understanding Data is just one of the many perspectives that the industry had pioneered over the years. Other perspectives (or approaches) include the Observer Approach, the Consumer Approach, or a combination. These are all topics for future articles.

Now that we established our first vantage point, lets look at another key characteristic of Data, that is, the Data lifecycle.

Essentially, Data goes through an evolution of its own, just like everything else in the Universe. In its initial state, when the Data is gathered, it is nothing more than an assembly of bits. Next, Data starts taking different forms or starts fulfilling different functions. In the prior article I gave an example of how a piece of Data generated by a meteorologic station is morphed into information that then can be leveraged. Quite intriguing is the fact that Data reaches its peak value during those evolutionary transformations in the earlier stages of its lifecycle. In other words, the time when the Data is at its highest value is within seconds or minutes since the moment it was gathered. If dont think thats the case, please think about that ONE text message that you just receivedit is important NOW! Twenty minutes and hundred text messages later you will hardly remember this ONE text message. Another day or two go by and you will completely forget it.

Whats even more intriguing is that different types of Data have different lifespans (and different value timelines). Some of them are very short lived, some of them seem to have more of traditional lifespan while gradually dropping their value, and some of them continue to be relevant for years to come. Categorizing Data based on its expected time value has implications on how we engineer Data processing systems. For example, if the data is highly perishable (its value drops in seconds) then processing that data has to happen really fast, otherwise the insights gained from it become completely useless. On the opposite end of that spectrum is Data that stays relevant for days, months or even years. Processing such data types require much more advanced architectures with an eye not only what we can learn from Data today, but also what it is that we will be demanding from it tomorrow. One such type of long lived data is the health data. The patient describing his health concerns becomes valuable almost immediately as the doctor uses that Data to prescribe the medication. Same Data becomes even more valuable over time for medical research, market demographics and so.

I hope this quick introspective into Data helped us realize why it is so important to understand Data and its many different facets before anything else. Where all this research transcends science and technology and becomes real is when we leverage it to improve someones wellbeing. Thats where the proverbial rubber meets the road!

In summary, having a predictable roadmap for navigating healthcare data records and extracting insightful information along the way is something that we, at [BitMED](http://bitmed.io/), had to address early on. But we havent stopped there! We embarked ourselves on a quest to advance our know-how and continue to explore new perspectives as we are being presented with larger amounts of Data, new geo-demographics, new behaviors, and new business demands. In spite of all that cool geekiness, the real value of all this work is to the Patient. The immediate benefit is Patients have access to higher quality care without having to travel hundreds of miles or having to spend countless hours on the phone. Thats when We, the Engineering Team at [BitMED](http://bitmed.io/), know that weve done our job!

Id like to leave you today with a question that Ive been pondering in my head for awhile: Is Data truly the currency of tomorrow?

Until next time, all the best!

I started my career in Analytics/Data Science some months ago,  and have been considering applying to renowned tech firms (e.g. Uber,  Airbnb, Quora and so on). I know it's difficult to get a job there, but  let's suppose I got into one. I keep asking myself if it would be a  better move to relocate to a major tech hub (like Silicon Valley, NYC,  etc) early vs. advancing on my career first and applying later for the  jobs that require more experience.

I live  in a Latin American country where the DS job market is very small and  opportunities for mentoring are almost zero. At almost any company you  go you'll either be the first data scientist to join, or if there are  older ones, they'll tipically be some business intelligence analists  doing some kind of modelling without much deeper knowledge or  understanding of the methodologies, algorithms and programming. I am  concerned about this situation because I guess it's more convenient to  get mentoring early in my career rather than joining a more mature place  (in terms of DS team) with 3-4 yrs experience when I'd maybe developed  some misconceptions or bad habits (regarding code quality, modelling,  etc).

Experienced  data scientists, what would be your opinion about relocating to  accelerate career and have DS mentors as bosses? Considering that during  these 3-4 years the job market will continue getting new grads with  less experience but more university credentials.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I know next to nothing about finding data. I am a recent college graduate with a biochemisty degree and I have been working in a laboratory as a contracted worker for 5 months. Nearly every person my age that I know with a full 4 year degree working in this industry is a contract worker through a staffing agency. I want to find out how many people in Minnesota with a 4 year degree in chemistry and/or biology related science are takimg contract jobs through staffing agencies compared to how many are taking permanent jobs throigh the actual company they are working for. 

My theory is of course that these large companies are cutting costs on labor by hiring only contractors for these ""fresh out of college"" jobs, therefore withholding new college graduates from basic benefits like sick leave, holiday, and vacation as well as higher pay for their skilled work.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently looking for some guidance on how to do better during the data science interview process.

Recently I have been not chosen for two open data science positions in which I have a made it to the last few candidates.

I do not know where my problems lay exactly, but I noticed during the interviews there always seems to be a part where I fall behind on answering questions about fundamentals. I know most if not all the fundamentals about stats, programming, etc...

Before the interviews I seem to have trouble knowing what to look over since the interviewers can be unpredictable.

Initially I come from a business back ground and have held positions as a market researcher and a marketing analyst. Since then I have utilized MOOC and open source software such as (R and Python) to learn how to apply the data science pipeline. 

My question to you all is what do you find to be the most used or important fundamental of each  part of the pipeline that has taken your the furthest? I want to make sure that I am at the top of my game during the next interview.

  
Cheers!

This thread is a weekly sticky post meant for any questions about getting started, studying, or transitioning into the data science field.

This includes questions around learning and transitioning such as:

* **Learning resources** (e.g., books, tutorials, videos)
* **Traditional education** (e.g., schools, degrees, electives)
* **Alternative education** (e.g., online courses, bootcamps)
* **Career questions** (e.g., resumes, applying, career prospects)
* **Elementary questions** (e.g., where to start, what next)

We encourage practicing Data Scientists to visit this thread often and sort by new.

In this model, I am estimating a coefficient for the energy effiency of a house (labels A,B,...,G where A is most energy efficient) to see how it affects the house price.For my full dataset I now have done the regression and can estimate how the different categorial variables A,..,G affect the house price. I am interested in now looking at how these variables vary in their effect on the house price for specific situations.

Example:I have an independent variable ""object type"" which indicates if a dwelling is an appartment (0) or a house (1).I would want to see if the effect of energy label on house price is different for appartments than for houses.

Inituitively I thought that I could just run two regressions: one on the part of my data with object\_type = 0, and the other for the data with object\_type = 1. I have also read something about adding interaction effects (so instead of column being label A, label B, etc.. it would be object\_type\*label\_A, object\_type\*label\_B, etc..). I also read something on multilevel models which could be used.

All of these methods seem to make sense for categorical variables (such as object\_type), but what if I want to see the effect of energy labels not for discrete variable object\_type but as houses grow larger? That is: I have an independent continuous variable ""size"" (in square meters) and I want to see how the effect of the energy labels on house price  (coefficients) changes as I increase my size? One could read this as: the coefficients in the linear regression are now my dependent variable.. This confuses me as it seems that I now have two regressions: one with sale price as dependent variable, and the other with the coefficients in the first regression as dependent variables.

I got some feedback on my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9sbt4j/looking_for_a_little_bit_of_help/

So i am going to write out the full problem with some general questions at the end. 

(I am not a native English speaker, so please forgive any spelling and grammatical errors. I also don't make a lot of reddit posts, I will try to format this the best i can)

I am an IT student and I am doing an internship at a company which makes gates for parking garages and such. This company has been collecting data for about 2 years now, but they haven't done anything with it. So their first question to me was, ""What can we do with the data we're collecting?"" and their second question/task: ""Is it possible to do predictive maintenance with the data?""

The data they collect is formatted in Bytes like this:
https://imgur.com/WbrpSS5

I transform this data by separating it into bits where each bit gives information about 1 of the parameters of the gate. 
https://imgur.com/rxd8fhI

So when :
limitswitchopen = 1 the gate is fully openend
limitswitchclose = 1 the gate is fully closed
traploop(ext) = 1 there is a car on of the detectionloop in the ground
rectloop(ext) = 1 there is a car on of the detectionloop in the ground
Safetyedgeclose = 1 a car or a person pressed the rubberlining on the outside of the gate during a closing cycle so the gate goes into an emergency stop
Safetyedgeopening = 1 a car or a person pressed the rubberlining on the outside of the gate during a opening cycle so the gate goes into an emergency stop

I plotted this data in Power BI:
https://imgur.com/gallery/ixU8tbe

There is an extra variable: 'Amountcycles', this is the cyclecounter which is different from the other data. This is the actual amount of cycles from the gate for each day. 

As you can see in the graph there is a big gap in the data. 
They updated the system which keeps track of the gate around july and you can see here that the amount of cycles is equal to the amount of ""limitswitchopen"" so from this point on the data quality is perfect. 

There is also another variable that i have yet to figure out how to get properly out of the data and that is for when cars drive through redlight which also causes strain on the gates. But the traffic lights are programmed different for each gate (i am confident i can get this data properly before i start the predictive analysis)

So the variables i have for the predictive analytics which cause strain on the gate are:
- The amount of times the safetyedges are pressed.
- The normal lifecycle of a component of the gate (motors &amp; bearings)
- Traffic light data. 
- I can see whenever a gate has had maintenance manually. (this is routinely 2 times each year)

TLDR:
A company which makes gates for parking garages has given me the assignment of making a predictive analytics model so they can reduce the downtime on their gates. 

Questions:
- How much does the incompleteness of the data matter? (it differs per gate)   
- What kind of tutorials do you recommend me for practicing?
- There are different kinds of gates, is it possible to use one model for all the different kinds? 
- How would an expert tackle a problem like this?
- I have until the end of January to complete this assignment, since i have never worked with ML/Predictive analytics before I don't know if this is enough time to finish a project like this by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to conclude my biomedical engineering degree and I am thinking about getting a master. I thought about bioinformatics, but reading some posts about it I found that many bioinformaticians tend to focus on Data Sciene after getting their master degree, so I am looking for information about Data Science too.

I would like to have a Data Science career but focused on biomedical data. I am currently living in El Salvador, meaning that if I want to study a master I must look for one abroad. Thinking about study an online one. 

But here comes my biggest question, Is it possible to get a Data Science career, specially in biomedical engineering, without having a Data Science Master? 

I would really like to study a master to have a support , but I have read that many specialists in Data Science say that most of Universities Syllabus are not updated , or not properly focused on the tools required by the companies, affirming at the same time that is  possible, although quite hard, to get a proper Data Science background more focus on updated tools and companies requirements. 

I have a pretty good background with programming (Python, R, SQL) skills, math skills and stats skills. That is obviously just the tip of the iceberg, and I know that it takes so much more than knowing how to program to be a qualified Data Scientist. 

If someone could give me an opinion in the subject, specially those related to biomedical approach, I would be really thankful.

Data science and sentiment analysis are new to me, yet I've been asked to provide scores on open text from a client. I've tried some of this with packages in R (which is also new to me).

My question is: what are the limits to sentiment analysis and what is the best way to get more accurate results?

For example, one response from the client is this:

&gt;Our company has lots of great benefits. We provide a robust 401k, education reimbursement and a flexible schedule. However, if I am going to stay employed here, something needs to be done about our medical plan. It is very expensive and doesn't offer all the great benefits that are available in other companies.

The analysis marked this as Negative, which I guess is probably correct. Although, the first sentence is pretty positive. So maybe it should average out as Neutral?

Another response was: 

&gt;401 higher percentage matching.

 This was marked as positive.  Out of context, that is probably right. But since people were given the option to leave comments, my team thinks it is really negative because they are probably asking for a higher matching percentage - which is saying it is too low. And I understand it is not a full sentence.

Is there a way to resolve some of this? Has management been watching too much science fiction and thinks sentiment analysis is capable of a lot more?  If our tiny shop got Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc. involved, would it improve? Not that that is going ever happen.

Thank you for helping!

Still bleary-eyed, you reach for your phone to check your messages. You turn the phone on. Before you know it, the tracking begins

But this tracking is not some kind of clandestine, paranoia-inducing government surveillance operation. Rather, its the geolocation data that your phones apps such as Facebook and Instagram transmit that enable you to be tracked.

This data can represent virtually any information thats collected by an app or service provider concerning where your phone is/was located at a certain time. From the moment you wake up to when you sleep.

Indeed, even *while* you sleep.

And its proving to be a veritable gold mine for hedge funds

 

### GPS = untappedalpha?

Estimates suggest [there are around 2 billion smartphone users in the world](https://thehub.smsglobal.com/smartphone-ownership-usage-and-penetration). Each one of these devices is likely to contain at least a few apps that are capable of tracking its users location. Apps that cover navigation, weather, shopping, and social media, for instance, are some of the most common sources of geolocation data. And even if were not actually using the app, geographical coordinates can still be obtained that indicate our phones position at any moment.

By using the phones GPS to send API calls to the Operating System (for example, Android), apps can determine where we are, how long we are there for, who we are with, and lots more information about our preferences and habits. They can then sell this geolocation data on to interested customers, including investment firms and digital marketers.

Just think of all the apps on your phone that require your location details. Uber needs it to connect you with their drivers. Fitness apps track your running routes and help to improve your overall performance. And Foursquare [uses location intelligence to build meaningful consumer experiences and business solutions](https://foursquare.com/about).

Hmm

Indeed, it was Foursquare that provides what is now considered a classic example of the immense value geolocation data can possess. The companys CEO Jeff Glueck [published](https://medium.com/foursquare-direct/foursquare-predicts-chipotle-s-q1-sales-down-nearly-30-foot-traffic-reveals-the-start-of-a-mixed-78515b2389af) a Medium post that predicted ahead of time that Chipotle would see a 30% decline in its sales for Q1 2016. As the app allows its customers to check-in at the places they visit, Glueck was able to use this information to observe a declining trend in foot traffic to the Mexican fast-food restaurants outletsand he did it so well ahead of the release of Chipotles results for the quarter which, not surprisingly, showed both heavy losses and a massive fall in sales.

I really enjoy working with data, and I'm wondering: 1) if a shift into data analytics is realistic, 2) what it would take to make it happen, and 3) what I might expect salary wise over time.

Relevant skills: 1) very solid in Excel including VBA (I'm basically our groups BI developer, but the only tool we have is Excel), 2) good with SQL queries and can synthesize lots of data, but most of what I do is extraction, and visualization tends to be done in Excel, 3) limited exposure to R and Python...need to learn a lot more and practice here, 4) extremely high work ethic, and my communication skills are valued.

Education: BS in finance, MBA in marketing (both from large state schools). Note that electives included calc 1-3, econometrics, intro to data mining (incl. cluster analysis, logistic regression, etc., but it was all in the XLMiner excel add-in).

Experience: 4 years as an analyst in microelectronics manufacturing and computer hardware manufacturing, stints in operations analyst, business analyst, and pricing analyst (very cost-focused). Would prefer to work in consumer industries, but I understand the bulk of my experience is industrial/tech manufacturing. 

I guess I'm wondering if I should switch into a data analyst role now and grow into a BI developer role, or if I should take MOOCs or get certified in Tableau, etc. and go directly after a BI developer role. Or is there a better strategy? More simply put, what should my action plan be, and how might my role/responsibilities/salary change over the next 3-5 years?

I'm relatively new to Data Science, coming from Industrial Eng. I've hit a wall &amp; I'm trying to figure out what I need to learn to overcome it. 

I'm designing a recommender system for thousands of people in a company. I'm recommending courses that might be of interest to people based on their learning plans. I'm all set on obtaining recommendations, but the results are in a csv or dataframe, which is probably OK for people who use spreadsheets frequently to look at, but not quite appealing (visually) for the bulk of my ultimate customers. 

In the long run IT will take our results and make them visually pretty, but in the short term (within the next 6 months) I'd like to create a very basic visualization or UI that our small group of recommender system 'volunteer validators' can use. They're in the same demographic as our end customer, and even if this visualization ends up not being used in production I would still like to figure something out that doesn't confuse them as much as the spreadsheets might. I don't know what yet, and my experience is with mainly with python, with beginner experience in Java and a few other languages. 

I was wondering what you've used in the past beyond spreadsheets to display recommendations while waiting for your recommendation system to be deployed in production. I'm very willing to learn, I just don't know what I should be learning, code-wise. Feel free to ask me any questions in case I haven't been detailed enough. Thank you so much. ",5,1,False,self,,,,,

I am an undergraduate student on industrial engineering from Brazil and have been working on a research project at uni related to natural disasters.  We are trying to gather and analyze data related to financial and social impacts caused by natural disasters, in order to propose new public policies for prevention and damage reduction. 

In this project I am in kind of a ""data scientist"" role. I am responsible for gathering data from multiple sources, clean it, do cluster analysis, statistical models, etc. 

Although I really enjoy the programming and modeling part, searching for data is a real pain for me. I don't know if this is a global issue but, here in Brazil, it seems like that most of social science and natural science data is completely scattered around the Internet, which makes it really time consuming (and boring) to search around stuff and do the whole data preparation.

Specifically in our case, we are gathering all kinds of data on state level (rainfall, temperature, unemployment, sanitation coverage,  gdp per capita...), so I've been through nearly a hundred .csv / spreadsheets from different sources so far and worked on them one by one in order to create a big dataset for future analysis. 

That said, I feel a bit frustrated because it seems that I still didn't hit the spot. 

First thing is that I feel that some of this work could be automated but I am still not able to come up with a solution with my actual programming level. 

Second is a bit more tricky. How does this ""data collecting"" process work in real life when companies need data from ""outside"" their environment (I mean, when they are not able to generate the data by themselves) ? Do companies buy the data they need? Do they hire specifical engineers to search around the web? 

I hope I am not looking like someone lazy, but everytime I think about what I have been doing on this project, I feel that it might be a smart way of doing things that I am still not able to get by myself or by the tutorials and books that I've been using. Am I being total non-sense? ",31,1,False,self,,,,,
