Anyone know of any interesting stats, machine learning or data science classes besides these?

----------------------

[Computing for Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata)

Starts Jan 6, 2014.

This course is about learning the fundamental computing skills necessary for effective data analysis. You will learn to program in R and to use R for reading data, writing functions, making informative graphs, and applying modern statistical methods.

----------------------

[Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics)

Starts Feb 17th, 2014.

This course introduces you to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. You will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena.
(NOTE : This course also uses R)

My thesis research has been comparing certain events produced in the ATLAS detector to the monte carlo simulations. In order to complete this research I have had to analyze and compare large data sets using a world wide distributive computing network.  As I reflect on what I have done, I realize that I enjoy playing around with data, expecially when I get to make and test assumptions and hypotheses; however, the life of an academic is not really for me.  

I am now considering a transition into data science.  Based on my research into this field, I am concerned that not being skilled in the particular tools that are common to data science might hurt my employment chances.  The software that I have used is meant for high energy physics use, so I do not have much experience with SQL, MapReduce, Hadoop, or R.  I have started working with these in my limited free time, but I am pretty focussed on getting this thesis finished up so I can move on with my life.  I am wondering how likely it would be for me to find a job in this field (preferably in Canada) without these skills.

TL;DR I am about to finish a MSc in HEP. I have strong math and analytic skills, and I have being playing with big data without the commonly used data science tools.  Will employers hire me and be willing to train me up based on my strengths in other areas, or should I focus more time in learning these tools before trying to find a job?",4,4,False,self,,,,,
