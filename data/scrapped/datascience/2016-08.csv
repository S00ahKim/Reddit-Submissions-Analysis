I've discovered how much there is to learn in data science not that long ago and I find it all very interesting and I'd like to gain some qualifications so I could be considered to be employed as junior data scientist. I've got masters in applied maths but mainly financial maths, so I haven't acquired a lot of skills used in Data Science these days (got some C++,SQL,R,VBA,Statistics,Probability basics though).


Anyways, since graduating I've finished an on-line Python course (Jose Portilla), learned REALLY basic methods of Numpy &amp; Pandas packages (Datacamp) and finished Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. I feel like I know a lot more than a few months ago but when I look at different Data Science projects (on Kaggle for example) I feel overwhelmed. 


Therefore I'm wondering what could I learn/do to seem more employable (I guess once I find an interesting entry data science job I'll learn a lot of new things). I thought about going through ISLR, but it's in R and I guess I'd like to go more towards Python.


Where I live, there aren't a lot of data science jobs (even in the capital) and if there are - I find mostly Senior Data Scientist jobs, where they require some serious knowledge and experience. Other, more basic analytic jobs base exclusively on Excel, which isn't in my area of interest. My dream would be to find a job where I could learn a lot from other, more experienced data scientists... one can wish :) I'd appreciate all tips and help.",3,4

It recently launched to the public at www.flaredown.com after a lengthy private beta.

The goal is to use the data the Flaredown gathers to identify patterns and correlations that might help patients of these hard-to-treat illnesses. For example:

- Does X treatment affect Y symptom positively/negatively/not at all?

- Are there subsets within our current diagnoses that could more accurately represent symptoms and predict effective treatments?

- Can we reliably predict what triggers a flare for a given user or all users with a certain condition?

- Could we recommend treatments effectively, based on similarity of users rather than specific symptoms? (like Netflix recommendations for treatments) 

- Can we quantify a patients level of disease activity based on their self-reported symptoms? How different is it from our existing measures?

We're starting to accrue a real body of data by now and I want to share it with data scientists, researchers, or anyone interested in questions like the ones above. To start, I could use advice on how to format the data for this kind of use. But after that I really want to dig in and start analyzing what we've got.

Based on the first meeting at the end of last semester, most of the members are people who are very much on the ""sports"" side of ""sports analytics"". Meaning not math or computer science oriented people, but more people interested in sports who want to learn how to apply statistics to stuff like fantasy baseball/football and just general analysis.

Point being that they aren't going to have a great resource for getting stats for any projects they want to do and I think this is something I can help with as I'm much more on the technical/statistical side of interests.

SO my question is: what are the best resources for sports data? Last year I scraped ESPN for college basketball data and that worked out okay. It seems ESPN *did* have a public API but no more. I've looked for other APIs but they're all expensive and company-oriented it seems.

Is there a better way or place to get useful sports data?

The club's interests are: MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL. College sports would be a bonus.",11,30

How much of the programming that you do is geared towards other things like creating dashboards, apps, model deployment, etc.?

I know this looks like a very long post, but I just wanted to provide all the info. Feel free to skip the backstory if you want and get straight to the meat at the bottom.

**Backstory:** I studied math and English in college and graduated in May 2015 with great grades and honors. I decided after graduation to follow the writing path, but I slowly realized I wanted to go back to more quantitative work, with computer science rolled into it if possible. After talking to a bunch of old math professors about graduate options in pure math, I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for and I discovered data science and fell in love.

Now I'd like to apply to a master's in data science program, like the ones at NYU and Columbia (though I'm happy to hear your thoughts about these programs), but it would have to be for the fall of 2017. That's fine because I'd like to use the time until then to expose myself to DS work and enhance my application. 

My math background is very strong, though mostly abstract work (analysis, algebra, topology). I have used Matlab for a numerical linear algebra course, and taken an abstract algebra course. I'm re-working through my old linear algebra textbook to refresh my abilities a bit. I took AP Statistics in high school and got a 5, but haven't taken any statistics since then so I'm a bit rusty.

My programming background is mixed. I took an intro to comp sci course in college that was taught in C++, and I have self-taught varying degrees of Ruby and Python and used them for small fun projects, but nothing serious.

**So I would like to bone up on my programming ability, and maybe some of my statistics too, to enhance my application and see the type of work I'd be doing in one of these programs.** (FWIW, the masters programs I've looked at say that most courses use Python, though occasionally R). 

Just as an example, the NYU masters in data science program [says](http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/admission-requirements/):

&gt; To be considered for the program, you will be required to have taken: Calculus I, Linear Algebra, Intro to Computer Science (or an equivalent CS-101 programming course), One of Calculus II, Probability, Statistics, or an advanced physics, engineering, or econometrics course with heavy mathematical content. Preference is given to applicants with prior exposure to machine learning, computational statistics, data mining, large-scale scientific computing, operations research (either in an academic or professional context), as well as to applicants with significantly more mathematical and/or computer science training than the minimum requirements listed above.

*My question for you:* This all seems pretty reasonable and doable, but I'm overwhelmed by how many options I have to do it! I wanted to get some input on recommended routes to take. Here are just some of my options, but I'm also open to others:

1) Take a [course at the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science](http://cs.nyu.edu/dynamic/courses/schedule/?semester=fall_2016&amp;level=GA) as a non-degree student. (Of course I would have to apply and get in). This would be my most expensive option (probably 5-6k) though it's still doable if necessary. The ""Mathematical Techniques For CS Applications,"" ""Foundations Of Machine Learning,"" and [accelerated PAC program](http://cs.nyu.edu/home/master/prospective_pac.html) all sound great, but might be a little overkill in cost and subject matter, not to mention time commitment. 

2) Take a [course at the NYU School of Professional Studies](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/professional-pathways/search.html?keyword=python&amp;semester=1168&amp;status=open&amp;format=in-person) like the [advanced python course](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/professional-pathways/courses/INFO1-CE9986-advanced-python-programming.html) which includes ""[gaining] a working familiarity with statistical analysis and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib."" This would be cheaper (about 1k) and a smaller time commitment (3hrs, 1x/week, 10 weeks). 

3) Take any of the **many** online courses on python and/or data science, be they coursera/edx/some random book or website. Just the other day, someone posted a [massive list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4vcwje/a_good_list_of_python_courses/) of Python courses online and it's totally overwhelming. This is by far the cheapest option (free to ~50/100 dollars for some of them w/ certificates), but how would I choose one? And does it look as impressive as taking a course? (One graduate program told me that online courses were just as good as university courses for enhancing my application, but I'm curious for more input.) 

So, what do you recommend, or what input do you have? Also, in addition to enhancing my programming ability, are there any good resources for reviewing/enhancing my stats ability?

I'm not sure which subreddit this question belongs in, but I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction. 

I work at a small healthcare research firm that primarily focuses on surveys. My graduate degree emphasized social science methods, including qualitative analysis. I thought it would be a good idea to actually analyze the open response data we get instead of throwing it to the wind like always. Just something to add context to the survey results. 

Over the past week or two, I've been learning Python and specifically the NLTK library. This week, I managed to write a small, very basic program to assign a sentiment to a set of comments, and presented it to my boss.

He liked what I did, but wants me to start researching commercial software for us to use instead. I'm paraphrasing, but it sounded like his reasoning is so that when clients complain that a comment was incorrectly labeled, we can blame it on the software instead of taking the heat ourselves. 

I was just really starting to get into developing a more robust model, but it doesn't seem like he wants to me to continue. So I'm soliciting **any experiences with commercially developed text mining or NLP or sentiment analysis or qualitative analysis software that automatically categorizes phrases and blocks of text**. I'm looking into IBM SPSS Text Analytics now, and it seems we might can afford up to 2500. Basically need something that has high accuracy and is very comprehensive, so that it blows developing a proprietary solution out of the water.

I think I saw it here. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've tried googling a whole bunch of terms but have had no luck.",7,1

I am taking some Scientific Computer class and trying to take as many data science relevant classes as possible at the moment.

I am considering adding a math minor now too, originally I had just wanted to do software programming or something, but now I am very interested in data science.  I will try to take stats and linear algebra, is there any other sciences that are relevent? (I have to take discrete math for the CS degree itself too).  If I take a math minor I will also be taking introduction to calculus type classes.  

I am studying in Canada and hope to eventually be employed in Canada.  It would be awesome if I could graduate with my degree and then find a job(s) and get experience in the career path and eventually have an employer pay for me to do a phd program, which I have heard happens.

I am wondering if this is going to be enough, or what else I can do to obtain a job in the data scientist career path.  

Is there any other potential things I should focus on developing skills for other than data scientist/analyst?  Maybe database engineer? But that doesn't interest me as much, but it could maybe be a combined work task position (which worries me but I'll try to get over it)

I forgot to mention - I am going to be taking as many online classes from Coursera/Edx/etc as I have time to take while studying.  Audit only, I am not paying for them in addition to my education.",10,1

==============
I have a input of 10 values, which are generated at runtime.
No information about the features is known until runtime. The number of categories per discrete feature might range from 10 to 20,000.
The features will be used as input into multiple machine learning models (such as Neural Network at first), in order to investigate which algorithm works at best for them in terms of classification performance. The final goal is to build a anomaly classification application.
The data has to be parsed to **csv** in the final step.

Information at runtime
-----------------
Foreach index these information are known:

 1. Value itself  
 - **normalized** between 0.0 and 1.0 if continuous
 - **vector position** in terms of OneHot Encoding Position for the ""1"", if discrete
 2. vector size
 - number of distinct categories, if discrete
 - ""1"", if continuous
 3. Discrete / Continuous
 - bool

Question
-----------------

 1. How do I build one **universal usable Feature Vector** for the majority of machine learning algorithms?
Importance of the algorithms in this order:
 - Neural Network
 - SVM (One-Class)
 - Bayes
 - Regression
 - Principal Component Analysis
 2. Could anyone provide some references for this? I need more for my thesis.

My idea, yet
==============
I thought about a nested model, in which each of the 10 inputs is connected to one ""input"" layer. Thus creating a single point of input. This layer consists of a nested feature vector. This is a OneHot Vector, if the value is discrete. Otherwise if the value of continuous nature, the input unit is solely the normalized value. I hoped that training would then force from each nested layer of discrete values to get me one continuous value, leading to having a input value of 10 continuous values. (you might realize at this point, from my working nature, that my experience focuses on neural networks yet).

Unfortunately I'm running out of time with my thesis to try all variations and experimentations out by myself without addition creative input.

Confusion
-----------------

 - Could this approach of ""continuousing"" all values work? 
 - How would I parse something like my system into a csv structure? 
 - Do other algorithms than neural network support such approach? I thought perhaps about putting everything into a vector of size n of the largest feature vector, filling all ""additional"" places here with zeroes. Also I thought about if it might be better to make the continuous values, at first, discrete too, by placing them into the corresponding places with the n sized vector. This would enable me to create one matrix where each row has equal column size, while each row represents one feature. However the matrix structure confuses me to for the neural network, as I'm not sure, if I would then train the neural network with one input feature per row (the approach already discussed), or just use one input unit per place within the matrix (like a image recognition neural network, where each pixel is one input unit, independently from its x/y axis position).",0,1

If I use logistic regression, for example, I can define this level of confidence by predictions with &gt;=0.95 probability of a single class.  I evaluate the model by what percentage of samples are classified with at least that probability, and of those samples calculate precision, recall, accuracy, etc.

Is this approach common, or is it somehow flawed?  How should I best restrict predictions on the confidence of the model, while also evaluating its performance?

I plan to create a tool where anyone can open a GUI, select a Suite, or a testcase through a drop down or a list, and see the historical running mean of its runtime (duration) performance. Every night one machine will parse through the website and get only the latest data and add it to the database. Then when anybody opens the tool, that tool will read from this database which is updated nightly.

The tree for this structure would look like http://imgur.com/a/mjWyu
NOTE: each test suite would have its own date and duration, and number of testscases. Each test case will have its own history of date, duration and result (pass, fail, error)

I am guessing the best way to store my data would be in a database. So what would be the best database and the best way to store this data (MySQL, or SQllite3, or something else). I have no experience with using databases, matplotlib, plotly so I would appreciate any suggestions or some sample code if someone has done something similar. 
Once this would be done, I am thinking of making it a bokeh app.

Now, let's say I want to create a regression model to predict the difference of `y` between pairs of y. 

    pair1 = 2.3 - 5.3 = 3
    pair2 = 2.3 - 4.7 = 2.4
    pair3 = 2.3 - 1.2 = 1.1
    ...

So I am predicting the absolute difference between each unique pair of data points. 

Question: what does one do with the features? Do you take the mean between two datapoints, or perhaps take the difference as well? 

For pair `pair1 = 2.3 - 5.3 = 3`, should `A` be 2-1=1, or (if the mean) 1.5?

(1) the number of ""peaks"" or normal distributions in this data (i.e. three in the above)
(2) the mean/position of each gaussian
(3) the variance of each Gaussian
(4) the height of each Gaussian/peak

I am an international PhD student (F1) in the atmospheric sciences who will be graduating in 2-2.5 years. After my PhD, I have no intention of continuing in academia due to multiple reasons, the primary reason being insane competition for academic positions. However, dropping out of the PhD program is not an option for me. I intend to graduate with the degree. But right after that I would like to work in the industry as a data scientist. As a start, I enrolled in an online machine learning specialization (Coursera  ML by U. Washington) and am almost finished with it. I really liked the course as a gentle introduction to ML. Also, I have taken intermediate stats courses in grad school that were required for my research. In addition to that, I am working through the book All of Statistics by Larry Wasserman. I also enrolled for a grad level ML course this fall. However, I am aware that ML/stats is just one aspect of being a data scientist. I would like to know what I should be doing now (see questions below), given the time (2 years) that is available to me. I would especially like to hear suggestions from people who have been in/are currently in my situation. Here are a list of questions I currently have in mind:  

1) What tools should I learn? What new skills (in addition to programming) should I pick up (at a minimum)?  
2) How do I break into data science internships coming from an academic background that is not heavily focused on ML or data science. Whats the right time to apply for these internships?
3) Do you have any graduate course suggestions?  
4) How do I make my profile appeal to data science employers?  
5) How should I plan so that I have a job right after graduation?  
6) A question for international folks who have been in my situation in the US: any visa issues that I should be aware of as I make the transition from academia to industry?

I'm a data analytics newb, and I've been struggling to figure out how to approach a research question for a dataset I'm working on. I've spent a good amount of time fruitlessly Googling and skimming reading material from several sources. My problem is, I don't even know what the name of the measure is that I'm looking for (or if there even is a measure). Just knowing *what* it is would be enough for me to get going in the right direction.

Here's an example of the kind of problem I'm trying to solve (this is only an illustration, not the actual problem):


* I have a dataset of common cookie recipes.


* For each recipe, I have the ingredients that were included in the recipe. (Like a transaction dataset, of sorts)


* For each recipe, I also have a score from 1 to 100 for the recipe's ""tastiness.""


* I want to create a model that will predict a recipe's tastiness score based on the combination of ingredients.


* Finally, I want to be able to determine the combination of ingredients most likely to produce the highest possible tastiness score.


I've spent time learning about Market Basket analysis, Association Rule Mining, various correlation calculations, multi-variate regression analysis, and decision-tree analysis, but it doesn't seem like any one of those is what I'm looking for. It's not regression, because it's not different attributes of a single observation predicting a value. It's not calculating the correlation of tastiness and the presence of individual ingredients and then combining the highest correlated items. (Maybe orange zest and spearmint are frequently found in separate tasty recipes, but the combination of the two always results in a poor score.) And it's not association rule mining alone, because I'm not trying to predict the likelihood of one ingredient being with another ingredient, but rather predict the likely value of an attribute of the transaction based on the occurrence of the association.

So, if not any of those, what is it?",7,4

I have been using **Python** at work for the past 3 years, so I would say I am fairly experienced with that and using PyQT, Pyside and using python for scripting. 

At our company we run *10's of thousands* of testcases for a daily regression. So I want to do a project on analyzing the performance for all our historical testcases. 

I plan to create a tool where anyone can open a GUI, select a Suite, or a testcase through a drop down or a list, and see the historical running mean of its runtime (duration) performance. Every night one machine will parse through the website and get only the latest data and add it to the database. Then when anybody opens the tool, that tool will read from this database which is updated nightly.

The tree for this structure would look like http://imgur.com/a/mjWyu
NOTE: each test suite would have its own date and duration, and number of testscases. Each test case will have its own history of date, duration and result (pass, fail, error)

**Question:**
I am guessing the best way to store my data would be in a database. So what would be the best database and the best way to store this data (MySQL, or SQllite3, or something else). I have no experience with using databases, matplotlib, plotly so I would appreciate any suggestions or some sample code if someone has done something similar. 
Once this would be done, I am thinking of making it a bokeh app.

Primary data

All kind of information, what we can get from a first-hand is primary data. Primary data is always collected from our research instead of books or any other written material, from second-hand source. To get primary information we can pick 3 data collection methods.

**Questionnaire:**

This is the most common data collecting method. The process may looks very simple because after we have the sample or focus group, we just ask the questions and record the answers. The tough part is to find the perfect group and questions. For this we can use our own made survey which can be filled online or a personal format. The other way is the interviewing. The biggest advantage in this data collecting method is that we can get tons of data, but at the same time the value of the data wont be satisfying. Participants wont give us perfectly correct answers. Unconsciously or consciously they will lie.

Recommended tools for data collecting:

* google forms :https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/forms/about/
* survey monkey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/
* key survey: https://www.keysurvey.com/
* zoomerang: http://www.zoomerang.com/
* snapsurweys: http://www.snapsurveys.com/survey-software/mobile-surveys/

**Observation:**

The second option is the observation. Compared to the questionnaire, it has a big advantage. The Observed person does not know that he/she is observed so the behavior will be naturally. In this case we can lock out the unconsciously or consciously lie. But on the other side of the coin this data collecting method can be used in a small scale. We can collect data for example about the in-store consumer behaviors like walked route or behaving while standing front of the shelf.

The observation can be used not only in offline field but in online webstores or any other websites. For this we can use eye-tracking cameras what is often used in the field of neuromarketing, or different online applications are tracking the users actions.

Recommended tools for data collecting:

* mouseflow: https://mouseflow.com
* google analytics: https://analytics.google.com

**Experiment:**

The third data collecting method is the experiment. It is a creative and fast developing type of data collecting. The common characteristics of every experiment are laboratory conditions and simulated market. When we are collecting data from an experiment always use one or both of the written methods above too. The biggest advantage of this data collecting method is that we can find answers for questions which could not be answered with other measuring techniques. The disadvantage of the experiment is there are just a few qualified companies for leading the process and it needs deep planning and preparing in favor of usable data.

The collected data can be separated in two groups:  Qualitative and Quantitative data. About this topic you can find more information in another article of our blog.
Summary

There are 3 methods of data collecting methods (Questionnaire, Observation, Experiment), we can use but it is not the end of the process. We need to organize, systematize and evaluate the collected data. For this we van use many analyzing and visualizing tools. Based on our experience we can recommend AnswerMiner on https://www.answerminer.com/

I have a data set that contains the following variables:
  * **Manufacture**: Who made the product (P&amp;G, Pepsi, Kraft, Tyson, etc.)  

  * **Seller**: Who sold the product (Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, Kroger, etc.)   

  * **Store Number**: The number of the store (Store 1, store 99, store 102, as there is more than one store for each seller)  

  * **Product**: What was sold (Mac n Cheese, Chereeo's, Frozen Cookie Dough, Apples, etc.)  

  * **Date of Sale**: when the product was sold  

  * **Qty of Sales**: How much was sold  

  * **Sale Price**: What was the price it was sold at.  

  
So, a record of data will look like this:  

Post, Wal-Mart, 2574, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, 11/12/2013, 50, $1.75  
  
I'm trying to answer two questions:
  
1) Which prices had a significant increase in price?
  
2) Who caused the price increase, was it the manufacturer or the seller?    

For question 1) it's fairly straight forward: find the percentage difference among the dates, and then determine the SD among all prices increases across all stores/manufactures, anything in the 90th or 95th percentile would be significant. (Is a better way to do this?)  

For question 2) I'm stuck. How do I go about answer that questions? As there is a product that is only sold at 4 different stores.

Any help would greatly be appreciated :)",6,6

it includes my resume, side projects (most important at http://alexmarshall12.github.io/projects/2016/04/24/manga-learn.html), etc. 

A few questions/concerns:

1. On my resume I put ""aspiring data scientist and software developer"". This is the truth, but I have heard people say you are supposed to project more confidence. Should I just say data scientist/software developer?
2. Rather than many small projects I have 1 big side project - the manga learn project linked above. What are your thoughts on this project? Is it a good example of what I will need? I learned one hell of a lot from it, far more than I have from any kaggle competition. It also reflects my work style - I am really good at finding useful applications of machine learning/data science as opposed to just optimizing it (shaving off loss % points)
3. My location is in Carpinteria, CA. This is near santa barbara. A lot of the jobs I am applying for are in NYC. Should I use an NYC address? How would this work since my current company is clearly in Carpinteria?
4. I have some personal blog posts there as well. Should I remove these?

I didn't find anything on it in the search and I wasn't quite understanding some of the stuff I was googling.


http://i.imgur.com/1TZKQAU.png

I created this graph using ggplot2 in R. Im beginning to learn the language and am using a sample data set provided by a book Im reading. 


This graph is showing income on a logarithmic scale (limits set from 1000 - 200,000), and comparing it to the Y axis which is a boolean seeing whether a person has health insurance.


According to the book, the 'kink in the graph' is at about $20,000. ""A cut here divides the graph into two regions that each have less variation than the total graph. It also expresses the relative flatness of the left side of the cut""

First off, how can i tell that the cut is at $20,000? That X axis is like gibberish to me. Second, what exactly does the curve at $20,000 mean? From the way the book explains it, most variation is in the region of the curve, while the flat parts correlate more. Is that correct?

I hope its okay to post something like this here. Any help understanding is appreciated! 

In case anyone is wondering, the book this is from is *Practical Data Science with R*. The code I used to graph this is:

    &gt; ggplot(custdata,aes(x=income, y=as.numeric(health.ins)))+

Just sharing a project I've been working on since March: 

https://github.com/RJT1990/pyflux

PyFlux is a new time series library for Python. It contains several new classes of models - such as score-driven models, non-Gaussian state space models, stochastic volatility models, Gaussian process AR models... - for native Python. It also has a flexible array of inference options that allows you to perform both classical and Bayesian inference on the models available.

There is still a lot left to be desired in this library: (1) need to set up Travis continuous integration and finish off the unit tests; (2) need to improve performance with further Cythonization and optimizations; (3) need to find better starting values for models, and improve the API in some areas.

But I'd be very appreciative of feedback - no matter how critical! - so I can further improve the library. This is my first major open source software project that I've built from scratch, so I'm sure there's a lot to improve with your help.

Thank you,

Though I have taken statistical courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, predictive analytics is completely new to me and I'm learning on the fly.


So, say I have 3 categories (A, B, and C) and a small pre-classified training set of n~500. I feel like what's most important is overall accuracy for A &amp; B - I want as many As in A not B/C, Bs in B not A/C. When I tweak the model, accuracy shifts only slightly and there are big shifts in precision/recall for the two categories. My web searches are leading me down a long rabbit hole where I'm coming up with half a dozen different metrics but no clue what's more important. There are no real costs/downsides to false positives or false negatives except the annoyance of randomly seeing something mis-classified. In the larger scheme of things that might change, but not until I can really understand what's going on now. 

So far, I'm calculating:

* precision (Category A &amp; B)
* recall (Category A &amp; B)
* accuracy (overall)
* Positive likelihood ratio (Category A &amp; B)



Here is an [example](http://i.imgur.com/AYi9BIB.png) of what I'm working with. 


I know that I may not even be asking the right questions. If anyone can spare an hour to talk or maybe an email exchange to dive into this with me, I'd really appreciate it. I'm also reaching out to data science/statistics meetups in my area for some one-on-one help.

As a person with less than minimal knowledge of statistics, I need your help. I am running advertising campaigns online and I want to be able to determine what variables in these campaigns impacted my revenue in the past and also what variables can impact my revenue in the future.

With campaigns on both CPC (paid per click) and CPM (paid per 1000 impressions) models, I have many different metrics to use as variables, such as the amount of impressions for CPC and CPM ads, the CPM value, CPC value, number of clicks, CTR, ad format, ad placement, landing page metrics, amongst others.

What would you say is the best way to achieve what I want? Would a regression model do the trick (and then should I observe the R to see how much each variable can explain of my Revenue)? Do you have any material to suggest that throws some light on what I should do and how I should move forward?

I've received great advice here before so I'm hoping I can hear some good ideas here. I'm tasked with improving a model for predicting churn based on how each account uses our software. Here are some issues with the current model:

Although we have usage data for the whole customer lifecycle,  the model was trained/tested on the last ""2-week bin"" counts of *software features* created before the date of renewal. First, this means a lot of data is neglected that falls outside of the previous two weeks, and second, the model is trained on data right before the customer was up for renewal. If we were to choose a 2-week count, wouldn't we want it to be more in the center of the customer lifecycle to better match when we would want know when the customer would churn (to be more actionable)?

What is the best way to slice this data? Would we want to compare a customer's usage (maybe 2-week bin or w/e) compared to their average usage over their whole lifecycle to understand when their usage trends up or down? 

I guess what I'm thinking is what is the best way to understand when usage is trending up/down? Are there any good resources for this type of problem?",3,3

Working on my six sigma green belt project and need to quantify a part of the project to show statistically that there was an improvement

Current state consists of two separate assembly lines one with 4 stations and one with 3. We're going to combine the two by taking the 3 station one and implementing it to the 4 station line. With the new available floor space we are creating a supermarket. Before this happens assemblers in the area will be given pedometers and make spaghetti diagrams to map their movements and record their daily steps and after measure to see if there was a waste reduction from Team Member travel activity and if it correlates with increased production. The current Hyposthesis is that there will be a decrease in steps/travel to assemble the product thus adding value to the assembly process and decreasing router time through this part of the process. While I don't have numbers yet I'm looking tirelessly online for feedback.

Any input is greatly appreciated and again if this is the wrong sub please let me know!

I have a decent amount of time to prep, so I'm looking for some resources that y'all may know of.

Maybe basic to intermediate methods for answering probability questions like ""A race track has 5 lanes. There are 25 horses and one would like to find out the 3 fastest horses of those 25. What is the minimum number of races one would need to conduct to determine the 3 fastest horses?""

First, a bit about me and my goals for the blog.

I'm graduating with a PhD in physics at the end of the year, and like many of my peers I'm looking to transition into data science after grad school.  I'm learning many data science concepts on my own, mostly through other people's blogs and examples.  I originally created my website to cement my understanding of each concept, and to provide a resource for anybody who may be learning similar topics.  I'd like for the blog to:

* Gather the relevant pieces of information I've come across in one place
* Provide an understanding of how each analysis technique is performed at a relatively high level.  (For instance, not ignoring issues like hyperparameter tuning)
* Provide example implementations of each technique by showing examples in Python. 
* Provide plenty of external links  for further reading on the topics

If anybody takes a look at the website (http://www.dealingdata.net/) please let me know what you think.  If you're an expert in data science I'd love to hear if you think the content is relevant to data science, and if you think I'm introducing the topics well.

If you're new to data science, I'd like to hear from you too!  You are the audience I'm trying to address, after all.  Are the topics being discussed interesting to you?  Do you like the format I've used, where I explain techniques as I apply them to a data analysis, or would you prefer to leave the details of the Python implementation out of the picture?  Is the website layout easy to use, and easy to read?

Thanks in advance!  I really appreciate people taking the time to read this post and (hopefully) giving me advice.

Edit: I'm glad I'm getting some positive feedback, but if you go to the site and happen to see room for improvement, please feel free to post it here!  Ultimately I made this post to see how I can improve the site.",12,14

The instructions were very vague and I was hoping someone here could give me a break down on how to properly make a hypothesis or a future state, and then perform test on this information to provide evidence to support that. By this I mean are there any empirical methods such as graphing the information to highlight correlations that I can create to provide evidence for my assumptions?

I just don't want to present information that has no structured process to come to a conclusion, and I have never dealt with datascience before so it's all very new to me, but I want to try my best to do well on this interview.

Little background on me.... I am an Industrial Engineering grad (~1 year removed) from WVU. While in school, I always found myself fascinated with the statistics courses..but ended up getting an entry level role with a manufacturing company as part of a leadership development program. That being said, I have mainly focused on data collection, mining &amp; analysis (intermediate level in Excel &amp; Access/SQL), as well as some traditional IE process improvement work.

Unfortunately, I have been disenchanted with what I have been learning and after spending a good bit of time researching, I ended up here.

I have taken the time to learn (at a beginner level) how to code with R and am learning Python at the moment. Outside of linear/logistic regression, decision trees, confidence intervals, and more traditional statistics, what can I do to better position myself? Does it make sense to go back to school??

I tried starting by reviewing the intro articles on Data Science Central, but I found myself leaving with more questions than answers. 

I know that my end goal is to build analytics company with a couple of my friends from school but obviously, I'm stuck. My current problem is that I have a high level idea of what it is I want to accomplish, but feel that I may lack the technical means to do so.

I'm not saying this to be a douche, I just wanted to make it clearer why they contacted me about an interview.

Recently I've learned that data science is the field i want to get into. The problem is that my only experience is basically thru online courses (Python and R courses). I still have two years left in school so my plan is to take as many programming classes at my school as possible (esp in Python and R), while still completing my physics degree.

The internship is for a startup i found on angellist. The interview is a video call. The intern description says R/Python and machine learning are ""required skills"". The issue is my R/Python skills are beginner (at best) and i know virtually nothing about machine learning. I didn't lie in my application (i just said i have R/Python knowledge).

I guess the one thing i do have going is the fact the internship is unpaid, which does decrease the applicants somewhat.

Data science is something I'm really interested in and this internship could be a good start.

Does anyone have any advice for my interview tomorrow? I just feel at this point im pretty underqualified for it but at the same time I'm really interested in it because the company also interests me.",4,3

Overview: My exploratory data analysis project I did to practice Pandas. Please note that this is **very** intro level work and am not trying to impress anyone.

Context: I am a college grad that is 1.5 years out of univ with a degree in information systems and have been working at a market research firm for the past 7 months. I do not feel good about this company because the ""analysis"" does not involve any real analysis, and I do not feel I am learning skills that will be relevant in the future. I found myself liking the idea of cleaning data, and I have been learning data science on my own for the past 4 months and hope to move out of this company to a more ""technical role"".

Short term goal: Data/Business Analyst that handles/cleans data
Long term goal: Data Engineering PM or something similar

Questions:

* Is what I'm doing worthy enough to be shared to employers looking for an entry level analyst position? Where should I focus? Also any feedback on what I did ""wrong"" or can be improved upon is extremely appreciated.

* How do I show I know SQL? I know basic SQL queries and such and even setup a mySQL database, but I don't really know a project to display my SQL knowledge and tie it in together with Python.

* I think I would enjoy data engineering but finding an entry level job in that area seems impossible with my background which is why I'm trying to move into an analyst position. Is this a good idea?

Let's say I am trying to predict monthly sales over the next three months. I have a dataset with data from 100 stores and each row is a store-month, stretching back six years.

I create a bunch of lagged values (e.g., sales 3 months ago, sales 12 months ago...). So far, so good! BUT, I'd also like to create aggregate features, e.g., ""Mean sales for this store, this month"".

I cut my training set out of the data, leaving the future data I want to predict (validation and test) out of it. I create my aggregate features. I train the model on the training data, tune my parameters and select my features based on the validation set performance, and then finally test on the test set. 

**Here's the issue:** In the creation of the aggregate features and the training of the model, I am using all entries available (e.g., all January months for store X). I use these aggregates as features for every training obs (e.g., even the first January), meaning I am pairing future data with past data and violating the *No Time Machines Condition*. I'm just not letting any data from my validation/test sets contribute to the features. 

Now, if anything, this seems like it would lead to overfitting and poorer performance on the test set. These sorts of features do match how a human might reason out a store's performance ('Well, how does it usually do in December? How does the store do on average?'). 

Is this data leakage? Am I wrong in my thinking here?

Would like to announce v0.1.2 of [badfish](http://github.com/harshnisar/badfish) which is a python library to analyze and wrangle through missing data. It's built over pandas and we've tried to give it a convenient api - which reflects some of the usual questions we have while dealing with missingness.

Current methods include:

 - correlations between missing columns
 - basic counts
 - cohort (group difference between missing and non-missing)
 - association rule mining ( A is missing --&gt; B is missing )
 - patternplot (vis for permutations of missing columns)

We are very open to feedback, issues and other comments!

I've been looking for a job in predictive analytics for three months now and have had only one serious interview. As part of a comprehensive review on my job search efforts, I'm hoping some domain experts can offer suggestions for improvement on my resume and cover letters. I'll also provide some details about my search-and-apply methodology for critique. All questions and feedback are greatly appreciated, especially the tough love. **Thank you!**

[Cover Letter](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7_kRt-gp-xbeDM4OEhFcml3ajQ)

**Knowing the position** - One major improvement I've made in my search efforts is refining my search to positions that best match my skillset. I'm looking for positions that are geared towards statistical analysis and predictive analytics, and include the use of software that I'm versed in. I have gravitated towards a quality-over-quantity application strategy.

**Tracking opportunities** - I've been maintaining a spreadsheet that keeps track of my job search efforts, including positions of interest, positions applied to, recruiting contacts, and hot companies.

**Networking** - Another major improvement I've made in my job search efforts is reaching out to recruiters at companies I've applied to. I try to genuinely express my interest in both the position and company, and ask for an opportunity to speak briefly over the phone about the role.

**Building an online profile** - I've tried to build a strong online presence to promote myself over both LinkedIn and GitHub. I give descriptions of courses and project work on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/codyfrehr) and pushed some project files to [GitHub](https://github.com/cfrehr).

I'm currently seeking employment as a data analyst either in an an entry level position or through an internship. Thus far, in the span of about a month, my attempts at doing so have largely been unsuccessful. It's somewhat understandable however because I have no actual work experience in this area and some of my related skills are at a rudimentary level. I'm getting a master's degree in applied mathematics at a state university and have basic, not proficient, knowledge of SQL and R. I've set my eye on also learning Python, Hadoop, SAS and maybe even Tableau as many of these seem to be essential skills in the data analyst's toolbox.

Assuming I can't find a related internship or entry-level work in this field on my existing circumstances, is it a good idea to polish my programming skills and work on building an attractive portfolio that can potentially gain me such employment despite my lack of experience? I mean, is obtaining employment this way even likely?

I should mention that I have an upcoming interview for an internship that might include some aspects of data analytics (the recruiter wasn't exactly sure and instructed me to ask the individual interviewing me to get exact details). Were I to be offered the position, I would be somewhat apprehensive not only because this internship may not be entirely oriented around data analytics, but also because it's a non-paid, 3 month position and would require 20-30 hours per week. I only have enough money to last me the next two months, which might even be an optimistic estimate, so if landing a job through a good portfolio is possible, then I rather not take this internship and look for temporary paid employment. 

I'd be very grateful to hear any Redditor's thoughts on the matter. ",37,11

I am in need of some assistance or advice. I do not have a data science background. I have a software engineering background. I apologize if that means I inadequately communicate anything below. I am happy to clarify anything that needs clarifying.

I have been collecting a set of data and want to identify whether there are any trends, groupings, or anomalies contained within it.  I want to do so in a way that is unbiased though, and as a result I want to find someone unfamiliar with the content and context who would be willing to help me.

The data in question is roughly 6500 distinct entities, each one has a creation time. Each entity also contains a list of scores at various times after its creation. I can provide more information if it helps with the analysis.

If I provided this raw data to someone, would anyone be willing to analyze the data to see if they can identify any trends, groupings, or anomalies? My intention is to also include an encrypted file that contains the mapping from the abstracted entity to its real life counterpart - the idea being I could provide the encryption key after analysis so that the analyst can verify any claim I make is truthful.

If this is an unrealistic request, can anyone give me guidance on what I would need to do to make it more realistic?

I work with dat sets a little different from most of you, I assume. I'm involved with testing electromechanical systems. Some tests produce a rather standard set of data with one entry for each attribute. However other tests collect thousands and thousands of entries for each attribute/test.

One example of a test would be running a robot as a complete system and gathering relevant metrics.

The other style of test would be running a repetitive motion test (RMT) on a component where I collect a few hundred thousands measurements until it fails. 

How would you store these two types of data for easiest usage in Python? Test results currently are entered in Excel from observations or recorded via LabVIEW or Python programs. We're not getting the full value of the tests because we have such a hard problem pulling up historical data and problems a proper DB would solve. On the other hand feature creep is a constant struggle with these tests as we release new products or want more data.

However, I had a data science intern interview as part of Google's college internship programs.  This was a week ago. As always, there's those quirky questions. This one struck me the most, and I'm curious what you guys think of how data science can be used to answer this question:

_________________________________________________________________________________________

At your Casino, you're the head honcho. By the roulette table, you notice a man who you've never seen before sit down and calmly focus on the wheel. Obviously, you would scoff at him because there's no way skill can be involved. Still, over the next hour, the man slowly begins to beat the house, defying the odds. You don't want to scare off a potential patron, but you definitely don't want to be losing money. What do you do? 

P.S. The rules of the interview:
- I could not ask clarification questions for this one, they told me to use my imagination and interpret the scenario as I wanted.
- 5 minutes to think about the question.
- 5 minutes to state my answer.

It can be concluded that Google's interviewing process is unbelievably complex (LOL).

My Physics professor recommended me this major after my research experience with him. I'm not sure where I should start as right now since I'm not in a University yet and I have no extensive knowledge of what this job entails. I am a sophomore in community college and hope to transfer to UCI where there is now a Data Science program. Here is a list of questions I wish to ask:

- What books should I read to better myself in a Data Science mindset 
- What internships or job opportunities should I search for as a sophomore in CC with a 3.5 GPA. (If any)
- Are there any programming languages anyone highly recommends for the job field?
- Any good books for math review of important formulas (for calc 2 series and stats)
- What can I do to set myself apart from other people of the same major?

I want to note I have only taken two programming courses so far in my life (So one year in total of programming). This is only a basic python course and java course. I will be taking data structures this year. I know this is a lot to answer so answering any of the questions listed above is more than amazing!

I have a master's degree in a quantitative field. My graduate work focused mostly on statistical research using various regression techniques including programming several different models by hand (rather than regression functions like in Excel) and running them using different data sets.

I always envisioned ending up in something like a data scientist role, but after grad school, I don't know that I'm intelligent enough for a career using super in-depth statistics without a professor there to consult with. I ended up in a data analyst role which is less about statistics and more about combing through data for trends and using summary statistics. When I started, I really enjoyed the work because I my job included programming and writing reports. I also felt like the work I was doing was contributing to something useful.

My work at the company has changed somewhat of late, and I also don't find myself enjoying the work as much as I used to - not sure if it's boredom, cynicism, or just apathy. I can't wait for the day to be over, and I've been in a general sour mood.

I guess I'm curious about the experiences of other current/former data analysts. I'm wary of trying to find a new job because I make decent money and the culture at my work is fantastic. I worry about making a change and ending up somewhere with douchey management or coworkers.

""The program has been myopically focused on generating more revenue (students), and devotes the bare minimum of resources to graduates.

The multiprocessor and the cluster programming assistance is important to have when data grow large, which is very often the case now.

What's really bad and shameful about Spark is the out of memory problems that keep cropping up.  Spark needs to be much more dynamic and flexible.  Silly memory boxes are really unhelpful and wasteful of human time to fix.  They need to just go away with smarter software.  

If java is the problem then java needs to go, or Spark needs to automatically perform the workarounds and the adjustments to the settings in response to out of memory errors.

If you are using Spark for anything bigger than a toy program, then you are running into out of memory problems. This is shameful.  The physical memory capacity on a computer is not even approached, but spark runs out of memory.  This is horrible for production systems.

Out of memory is really old fashioned when plenty of physical and virtual memory is available.  In 1987 at work I used a numerical package which did not run out of memory, because the devs of the package had decent computer science skills.  The data was a lot larger than physical RAM, let me tell you. SAS was the numerical package.

Spark maintainers, YOU MUST UP YOUR GAME!  Go to 1986 and ask SAS if you need lessons on memory usage.  Throw away java if set top box paradigm is not working for cluster programming with big data in 2016, BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING.",23,6

I am currently getting a BS in computer science (just finished my freshman year) with a minor in applied mathematics. I always wanted to be a regular software engineer, but I got a job at a major information storage company this summer (wont drop names but they are the market leader in enterprise storage, closely related to DELL) doing UI web development and had to do a ton of training on information storage management which got me fascinated with big data. My question is can I get a job in data science with a BS, or do you really need to have a graduate degree. And if so, where should I focus my masters? Is Computer Science ok? Or do I need to pursue a more math heavy program? Also, my college offers a minor in bioinformatics, which , to my understanding, is essentially data science when applied to biological data sets and genetics, should this be something I pursue? I have done a lot of maths classes at my school, including a pstats course that taught R so I at least have some knowledge of what seems to be the biggest tool. I intend to take a course on machine learning also.

&amp;nbsp;

Lately I have been thinking a lot about a move to a data science career. Before I move on I should tell a little bit about my background. I have a bachelor within Geography (well technically a combination between Earth Sciences &amp; Economics), which included some classes in data analysis. Note that I am speaking about the period 2007-2010, so it is quite a while back.

&amp;nbsp;

Afterwards I moved to Denmark (being Dutch myself) and got a Master degree within Nature Management. This covered a variety of courses, including some in GIS (which I loved), and I ended up doing a hedonic pricing study as my master thesis, concerning the influence of public amenities on house prices (proximity to lakes, parks etc), and actually used GIS and R for this. After being done in 2012 I tried finding a job in Denmark, but even do I had pretty good grades I had trouble finding a job mostly due to a language barrier (most jobs I applied were within municipalities or ministries, requiring fluent Danish).

&amp;nbsp;

Since I always had an interest in programming and needed a job, in the period between 2012-2014 (in between internships related to my studies) I learned myself programming. I landed a job in 2012 as iOS developer and currently at my second job in another company doing the same. Even though I am fairly happy as developer, I do feel that I am not as passionate about architecture etc as others. I am starting to feel that I do miss doing something related to my studies. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then lately I have been reading a lot about data science/data analysis and actually have a great friend with a big interest in the field. I suddenly realized that I have had quite a few classes that were more or less directly related to this field, as well as me writing a thesis with help of GIS and R, and my lifelong love of maps, graphs and stats.
I suppose my 2 years of working as a developer could even be a great investment for a move towards data science. So I suddenly realize that perhaps data science is a way to combine my studies, with my experience within programming..

&amp;nbsp;

As I have taught myself programming, I am actually not so intimidated to pivot my career again. I would probably start with reading up on statstics, as well as start playing around in Python and R, as well as some D3 (always have liked to!). Then I guess I will write a blog about my experiences learning, and create a portfolio to show my skills. Perhaps this could be enough to get a job within the field in a year or so?

&amp;nbsp;

What I basically would appreciate is some opinions on my thoughts and on the feasibility of this plan :)",7,6

I produced several infos and graphs with this dataset: average/median of time spent for every decision, year-by-year of new decisions in the court, comparisons with different datasets (tax law cases, labor law cases, and so on), a bar graph with the subthemes of that topic and it's corresponding shares in the number of total decisions, success rate depending on the plaintiff etc.

It is a fairly simple descriptive statics analysis of the dataset, and an exploratory one in that.


Well, now I have to present this ""exploratory study"" to some senior researchers and they are very strict about proper good practices in data analysis. Keep in mind that in Brazil, it is highly unusual to pursue quantitative studies in Law, so even if they are strict, maybe they don't have the same standard as a foreigner researcher.

Finally, my question: which kind of infos should I assess and present on my dataset? Sample size, population etc. 

I'm eager to improve this newbie research and be more serious about the diminutive statistical analysis I present. If you could help me pointing relevant questions they may ask/I should know about my dataset/study and/or relevant links, I thank you.


Yours,

I like the type of work I am doing as a whole so I want to find something within the same general area.  My role is analytics based, but its definitely not full-fledged data science.  Here are some key aspects of my current role:

* I develop and make recommendations on new KPI's and also develop reporting for my department based off of various KPI's that are extracted from multiple sources.  This involves using SQL, Access, and a little SAS to extract the data and then merge all the datasource together for pretty reports.  
* I run ad hoc analysis to know ""What is the driver of this thing happening""
* I work with the business to understand the future vision of the organization/projects and give input on how to achieve it so that we can measure the impact and provide meaningful MI.
* I work with IT partners to build requirements for new data extracts and perform testing on system upgrades to ensure data flows through correctly.

The role does not include doing traditional statistical testing or predictive modeling.

How would you describe this type of role from a job title perspective?    If you had to choose a job title for this, what would you call it?  ",1,4

Needed some help  on this. Say there is a question what would you spend on :

1) Car
2) House
3) Wedding
4) xxx
5) xxx

They have to pick 3 options in terms of priority.



So my data has the respondents vertically with each of the options horizontally. So : ( I dont know how to format this but this is in tabular form)





Person     Car   Rank    Wedding Rank    House  Rank ......
Jake          1      3         1          1         1         2
Alex          0      -          1          2         1         1

Where 1 says they've selected that option and 0 says they haven't.

How do I restructure this data to use in a regression model with weightage given to rank? Is it possible?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT : Table form, couldn't do it in reddit .
