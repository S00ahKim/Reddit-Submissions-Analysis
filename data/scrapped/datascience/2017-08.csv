Need advice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6qxcut/reflecting_on_a_previous_interview_question_need/,engineheat,1501604812,"In a preview interview, I had a case study where I had to classify whether someone will get a disease or not. The probability of getting the disease is 1%.

I mentioned I will use a logistic regression, and I would use many variables such as demographics info, medical history, lifestyle factors, etc. I mentioned it doesn't hurt to start with many variables since we can do variable selection later.

I was asked how many data sample I would need. I said it depends on the cost of data acquisition and the acceptable variance of the model. But later I realized there is a ""rule of 10"" rule of thumb for logistic regression where the number of samples should be (number of predictors) * 10 / (the probability of the rare case).

Anyway, the follow up question is that because the data samples are taken from those that can to the hospital for a checkup, can the results be applied toward the general population? I said no because people that go for check ups tend to be health conscious and therefore would not be an accurate representation of the general population.

But I was asked how to compensate for this and I drew a blank. And how would you quantify the ""difference"" between those that came for checkups and the general population?

Can you advise on anything I answered poorly or wrong so I can improve?

I answered as long as our model contains all the variables that may be different across the two groups, and if those who came for checkups have a wide scatter of values for those predictors (even if the mean might be different than the general population), then the logistic model would still be valid for the general population.

I have a question about the data set I'm working with that I hope you can help me answer.  I have a data set that (for reasons I won't get into) has largely the same input variables for different output variables.  The data is broken up by country, and each country has all the same inputs with varying outputs.   Here's an example of what I mean:

Target | Country | Variable 1 | Variable 2 | Variable 3 | Variable 4 | Variable 5
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
.044 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.022 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.032 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.096 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.412| USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.112 | UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.102 |  UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.098 |  UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.133 |  UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.099 | Mexico | .3 | 4.35 | 1903 | .15 | -0.5
.111 | Mexico | .3 | 4.35 | 1903 | .15 | -0.5
.143 | Mexico | .3 | 4.35 | 1903 | .15 | -0.5


Hopefully this is enough so you can understand what I mean.  The input variables are the same for each country, and the target varies slightly.

Something about using the data like this for a regression feels *wrong*.  Should I average the target variable for each country even if it greatly reduces the overall number of records that I have?

Edit:  I also want to point out - my target variable came from actual proprietary data, while almost all the other data came from was pulled in from other sources and repeated in order to match the country variable (I pulled it from BP, World Bank, etc. and matched it with the country I had for each record in the proprietary data). Does that many any difference?

To be clear, the above data is completely fictitious.

I guess I'm looking to get into data science. I was trained as a programmer, and in the course of my career I've also been a sysadmin, DB admin, network guy, hardware tester, and so on and so forth. I'm pretty good at all of it. But every now and then I'm given a big, messy, ugly dataset and told to extract something useful from it, and I'm *really good* at that.

Just for example, a while back I was working for the documentation department of a major hardware manufacturer, and we were asked to take all the documentation the company had ever produced and put it all online for the first time. This was three decades worth of PDFs covering thousands of products in thirty-odd different languages. All of them had been scanned at some point, and given XML metadata, but the metadata had been hand-edited and was often incomplete, erroneous, or specified the wrong encoding and displayed as gibberish.

My team lead--a better programmer than I was--looked over it for a while and decided it was too inconsistent to automate; the whole team would have to pitch in to check  every document manually, at a cost of some 200 person-hours all told. I asked for a few hours to try to pick out just the entries that were 100% complete and compliant, to save us a bit of time. In the process of writing that script, I noticed that many of the errors repeated consistently, and with a few reliable markers I could deduce what they were supposed to be; e.g. if the metadata specified, say, Chinese Simplified (GB2312) encoding and produced gibberish, usually it was supposed to be Chinese Simplified (GB18030), and it was easy enough to see if the text in the XML file looked like GB18030 encoding.

I put in three 12-hour days, iterating and examining the results and iterating again, finding and nailing down patterns, and by the end of it I had a script that correctly classified 98% of our documents.

This kind of work is enthralling to me, and I seem to be good at it despite zero formal training. I literally do this for fun--spreadsheeting data and analyzing from games is as much fun to me as playing. I'd love to find steady work like this. But just saying that doesn't impress interviewers, and I really don't even know what kind of jobs I should be looking for. I've been calling it ""data analysis"", but I've also seen ""data science"" and ""data engineering"", among others.

So I guess my questions are: How do I find work like this? What should I do to market myself? Are there courses I could take to teach me standards, methods, and tools that I'm not aware of, and/or certifications I could get that would look good? Are there any other forums where I should ask this?

I'm not sure where I should point them for an appropriate introduction to pandas. First they need to pick up basic programming and python concepts, but not spend too long on this before focusing on pandas.

Python for Data Analysis is a great book, but probably assumes too much. It's tough for me to assess since I took a more typical route of learning to program, picking up python, and then learning pandas.

I've had quite the meandering road to work full-time in Analytics, so I thought this would be a good chance to detail the road I've taken.  It seems many posts here ask how people got into Analytics - I hope this helps.  I'm not yet a Data Scientist, but I'm on that road and I think this subreddit best fits this post.  Feel free to ask questions if you'd like any clarifications.

**This will be long!  But I want to give all relevant details to my path as I think it's an example of what an organic road into analytics looks like.**

**Education**: I graduated from a large state university with dual degrees in Economics (BS) and International Studies (BA).  I wasn't planning on working in analytics; I thought I was going to work internationally and spent time getting fluent in Spanish while in college.  Those plans changed!

**First job - August 2010**

* Customer Support Rep for a small tech startup

I had no idea what Data Analysis was at the time, but I started naturally doing it.  There would be a change to our website and I would receive upwards of 2,000 emails about the change. I would go through the tickets and create an analysis - with suggestions for the product team - based on the feedback our customers gave.  This quickly got passed up the chain and became a regular analysis I did for the executive and product teams when a major site change happened.

This was my first foray into analytics - I had no idea what it was, but I liked the process of aggregating, interpreting and presenting data in a way that helped others make informed business decisions.

**Second Job - Promotion - July 2011**

* Promotion to Account Manager for the same small tech startup

I was promoted up the chain in sales, but still wanted to do analytics.  I took over the administration of Salesforce and started making various reports without being asked - sales forecast reports, pipeline reports, backward-looking sales reports.  Anything I could think of - and I became trusted to make those across the company.

**Third Job - Acquisition by large company - April 2013**

* Client Manager for large East Coast software company

The startup I was working for ran out of money.  We were acquired by an east coast software company who didn't guarantee any of our jobs.  Even though I was seeking to be an analyst, I wouldn't keep my job if I played that angle. So I interviewed for and stayed with a Client Manager role in sales.  I also had all analytics stripped from me - they didn't need me for that role.

Well, I still found a way around this.  I learned that the Client Management superiors had no reporting on what I and others were working on.  No analytics around our sales, our renewals or what we were on track to do for each quarter.  Bingo!  I had a new analytics job.

I created a dashboard for the management on my team to track our sales and renewals by rep and by team. They loved it, and I got to keep analytics going at least part time at my new job.

However, an underlying issue remained - I wasn't anything more than maybe 20-25% analytics.  I was getting pigeonholed into a Sales career and I didn't want that to happen.  It was time to make a move, but I had no idea what to do. 

I started talking to others in analytics, asking how they got their jobs.  All paths were unique - but all involved somehow convincing a company to take a shot on them as a low level analyst, even part time.  So I started job hunting for positions like that.

**Interview that changed the trajectory of my career - May 2014**

I had a contact at a growing manufacturing company that had no analytics.  My contact told me I could interview for a lower-level position that I could easily do, while taking on analytics tasks that were needed around the company as a test. I was told the position was a contract one and it was up to me to turn it into a salary position during the interview.

So, I had the interview with the CFO and the VP of Sales.  In the interview, I saw them shift from talking about a general contract position into seeing me as someone they could take a risk on as an analyst.  They had no one dedicated to this and I had enough passion (and a small track record) that they were sold.  I was to be hired on as an analyst 50% of the time until I proved myself capable of doing that 100% of the time.  I took a pay cut, a cut in benefits and signed on.

**Fourth Job - May 2014**

* Analyst 50% of time; other work 50% of time

I knew that I'd be in over my head but *wow* - that was an understatement.  I ended up in the equivalent of an ocean-sized whirlpool.  The company was growing at a 100-120% rate per year.  Employment was doubling every year. And there was no one doing analytics.  On top of that- my analysis had to be *perfect* - a mistake of 1% meant the company over or underordered by USD $1M.  And man, was I not perfect.

I had to learn how to build a database for the CFO, manage metadata, create financial reporting.  I had to make royalty reporting outputs.  I needed to create ordering reports for the sales team, a catalog the sales team could reference at any time of day to see what was in stock.  So much more.  I had to do everything all at once, with little experience.

I was close to being fired at one point.  Not due to lack of passion, but because the margin for error was so low, and I was going to make errors as I learned how to be an analyst.

But I got over that hump, kept my job, and kept learning.  And convinced them to turn me into a full-time analyst.

**Fifth Job - August 2015**

*  Promotion to Data Analyst (100% of time job!)

I call my previous position and this one my Data Masters Degree. I was underpaid. I learned everything from database creation to executive dashboards in Tableau.  I learned SQL from scratch. I learned how to gather requirements from executives and turn them into actionable reports/analyses.  It was incredibly stressful but rewarding. I became trusted around the company and became an analyst supporting nearly 250 people across all departments.  My reports and dashboards were visible all over screens and computer monitors throughout the office - as an analyst, there's nothing cooler than seeing your stuff helping people do their job.

But, all good things come to an end.  Eventually I was told that the company didn't need me as an analyst anymore; they needed to build out a data warehouse and it was non-negotiable that I'd head up that project.  I feared getting pigeonholed as a DBA and started looking for a new analyst job in the area to keep me on track.

**Sixth Job - July 2016**

* Web Analyst

I found a new job as a Web Analyst.  It was for a consultancy  It wasn't perfect, but I was finally being paid market rate for my skills.  I got to learn how web analytics worked.  And more importantly, I was no longer turning into a DBA.

I'm still at this job and am responsible for web analytics at a major international brand.  I have many client stakeholders who live far away from me, but I still manage to create KPIs, manage analytics, create readouts and more. However, much of the job is very basic in analytics when compared to my previous position.

Unfortunately, the company I started working for was bought out as I joined.  This time by a new East Coast company that has bungled the purchase.  Of the 20 analysts at my office to start the year, only 10 remain.  It's a mess-  we are doing boring work that isn't challenging, with no prospects of improvement. I will stagnate here, and that is not good in the analytics world.

So, I have started a new job hunt and feel I'm at the verge of moving into another analytics role at a fast moving company --

**Seventh Job - Search & Offer - August 2017**

I've been searching for a new job.  I put down some pretty specific requirements that I wasn't sure would be easily findable.  I wanted a small to medium company (I find doing analytics at a large company puts me in a smaller role than I want).  It needed to be growing - working for a shrinking company is terrible. It needed to value problem solving (a skill I think I have and I love using). It needed to value technical ability for analysts. It needed to not want to kill its analysts by working them 60+ hours a week.

I think I've found that role- it fits all those checkboxes.  I've done an in-person interview and received an offer this week which Im very excited about.  I'll again start growing in my technical abilities and make a different at a growing company with an underdeveloped analytics arm.  I'm excited to be looking forward to going into work again.

------------------------

So, that's my story of my first seven years working.  Analytics is an exciting world.  I want to continue to learn Statistics to start working on forward-looking analytics that you see from actual Data Scientists.  I may end up in management someday.  What I know is that I need to keep growing and a path forward will present itself.  Life has a funny way of not going to plan, so I just set up a structure and move within that.

I'm happy to answer any questions.  I know this was long, but I hope it helps give a sense of what an organic path into a career in analytics looks like. ",23,59,False,self,,,,,

My team consists entirely of classic .NET and BI **developers** - not analysts or data scientists. These colleagues of mine are tasked each week with completing a variety of analytics projects, from basic report development to predictive modeling/ML.

Remember that these guys are traditionally developers. I'm not saying that developers cannot or have never successfully done analytics, but that is not the case on my team. DS/ML tools are just not on their tool belts at this stage of the game.

Examples of some errors I've had to correct in the last couple of weeks: someone used a unique identifier (an index, basically, which *could* contain predictive info, but didn't in this case) to predict whether a generic customer was going to buy another product; the same person also used the amount the person spent on their second purchase to predict the likelihood someone would buy a product **for the second time**. Lots of ""hand in the cookie jar"" modeling happening.

They also seem to be easily distracted by shiny new tools like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and XGBoost, focusing on testing *n* different models instead of worrying about the data actually going into the model.

**My question for you guys: how would you go about effecting change in the ways in which some of my colleagues perform analytics?**

My gut, as a statistician, is to have them go through rigorous statistical training, since this is really the biggest skills gap they possess.

I've had the fortune of having some good opportunities recently, most notably a job last summer and research this summer that involved using deep learning/neural networks for image processing tasks. When I was thrown into the deep end with neural networks last summer, it was definitely overwhelming but I got to ride on the back of a more experienced PhD student and ultimately learned a lot. Same case this summer: confused about many parts of the project, but benefitting from a lot of help from another PhD student.

Now however I have a lot of random knowledge about neural networks but still have big gaps in knowledge and have only completed one project independently, which was essentially just an NBA in-game win probability model using out of the box logistic regression. I am working as an actuarial intern right now, but that work is all in excel and not what I would qualify as ""data science.""

Do you guys think it would be possible to leverage these experiences to get an internship for next summer?

I need some advice for my current situation. I'm currently working in Wealth Management as an investment advisor, but I've begun to stagnate in my position/career. I believe it's time to make a move as I'm only getting older and the company I'm working for does not have a bright future or at least a future where a lot of growth is expected. I also don't want to be in an advisor role in the future, but would rather be purely on the buy-side of investing or doing quantitative research as an actual data scientist. 

I have a semi-technical background. I got my B.S. in Economics, but took Calc I, II, III. I also got my MBA with an emphasis in Finance where I took applied econometrics through the masters of economics program and an investment research class that used SAS. Academically I received all A's (3.97/4 for both degrees), but it is was at a state school in Reno, NV. For the last 3 years I've been learning Python, SQL, and various other computer science topics, and I've been able to build some projects that have automated tasks in my current position, and I'm also building out my personal website using the Django framework to showcase my technical abilities.

My goal/desire is to get into a more quantitative role for a firm trying to grow where I can leverage my finance/economics and programming background. Unfortunately my network is not great as my current role is with a tiny firm that hasn't provided me much networking in the finance or analyst world, albeit I am to blame for not networking harder. My current position isn't something to say ""wow"" at on a resume either, but I've been able to learn and accomplish a lot of tasks. But now I'm trying to make a move into a career that will be more fulfilling and not a complete switch from my professional experience. 

I was recently accepted into the Galvanize Data Science immersive program. I won't be attending until early 2018, so I can save money to avoid any debt. I also want to improve my stats and programming before entering the program to give myself the best chance for success. I'm currently hung up on the risk of the program though. It's $16,000 and I'll have to quit my job which pays around $85,000, so the true cost is much higher especially if I'm looking for a job for the average 3 months they state. I'm also concerned that my background isn't the best for landing a job quickly out of the program. I'll be looking for either a pure data scientist role or hopefully an investment analyst or trading position with a hedge fund. I do believe this program will be the quickest way to switch into a more fulfilling position with greater future career prospects though. I'd like advice from those in the field or who hire data scientist as to whether me joining this program is a good idea. Do you think I should take the risk and join the immersive program to get into a more fulfilling career?

I've been getting a lot of advice on how to break into the industry from my current position, and the most common bit of advice is to create some of my own projects. So I have an idea and I wanted to see if there are any practicing data scientists who would like to mentor me through the project. I'll try to explain my idea below. 

**Study:**
I'm a huge baseball fan and have been analyzing sabermetrics for a while now. I want to research pitchers and why some seem to constantly outperform or underperform their advanced metrics of FIP, xFIP, and Sierra. Michael Pineda for the Yankees is one of the examples that sparked my interest. He has great stuff doesn't walk many batters per 9, but his ERA was a full point above what the advanced metrics said he should be at in 2015 & 2016. This could all be due to bad luck, but I have another theory. Not all strikes are equal. Most agree that walking batters is a bad trait for a pitcher, but throwing fastballs right down the middle to avoid walks may be worse. I want to analyze the quality of strikes a pitcher throws. Good quality strikes would be those closer to the edge of the strike zone. baseballsavant.com provides me with the downloadable data. My hypothesis is that pitchers who not only throw more strikes but throw strikes that are on the edge of the strike zone will consistently outperform other pitchers even when accounting for velocity and movement. 

**Project Outline:**
My study outline will be as follows:
1. download and store the data for each player from 2010-2017. (PostgresSQL)
2. Clean the data and create a quality pitch metric. I think average distance from the corner of the strike zone will be an appropriate statistic. (Python)
3. Run regression models to predict ERA. (Python or R)
4. Complete a write-up and attach to my personal website. (Django)

I will use 2010-2015 as the learning data and then 2016-2017 as test data. 

Another idea is to use a leave one out validation technique to predict game by game based on the pitchers season so far. This will probably be computationally intensive, so I may have to leverage other technologies to accomplish it. 

**Potential Model:**
Expected ERA = B0 + B1QualityofStrike + B2BB% + B3K% + B4Velocity + B5Movement

I would love to get some input if there are ways to use deep learning to create a more accurate prediction or to help highlight players that may have made an improvement in their quality of strikes and therefore may outperform their historical performance. Or any advice on modeling techniques that will provide a better prediction.

However, for a tiny customer....they COULD buy all 20 products hypoethically. But, its completely unrealistic.

So, how do i give them a potential revenue number?

My thoughts on this is that it has to be probability based.  For example, either predict a classifier on whether they will by a product . if they will sum the products price.  

or maybe, downsize the potential opportunity by multiplying it by how likely they are to buy that product.  If its a 10k product, that they are 30% likely to buy, multiply it by 30%.

I am currently a Data Engineer on the Predictive Healthcare Team at Penn Medicine. Our team of Data Scientists builds and train models on data received from the electronic medical record (EMR). Working with clinical data often requires tedious validation and type assertion checking. Therefore, a lot of time is spent cleaning the data instead of training models with it.

aptos uses JSON Schema, a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents. aptos allows developers to validate client-submitted data at the source.

While there exist other JSON Schema Python modules, aptos is different because it also supports converting JSON Schema documents into various data-interchange formats.

Currently, aptos supports converting JSON Schema documents into Avro Schema documents, a popular serialization format for reading/writing data from HDFS.

Before I left a PhD program in Information Science and Technology this spring (I seriously recommend taking a gap year) I took an information visualization class and really loved it. I have experience working with data from past internships (language technologist working with large corpora on an active learning task) as well as my own studies in my undergrad and master's programs in linguists. Even though my background is primarily in applied linguistics I'm a decent Python programmer, have worked usingg scikit learn and NLTK a ton, and find myself happiest working with large sets of messy language data. 

With academia I had a set idea of jobs I'd be pursuing 5 years from now but with my recent departure I'm finding myself sort of in the middle of data science, NLP, and machine learning. I'm currently working on projects to beef up my portfolio to show I have a software development background and am a competent programmer (my github is lacking atm) but I'm really more interested in data science. I also have experience with R and Illustrator, and can code in Java, Perl, and bash. 

My question is are there any skills I should try to develop before applying to data science jobs that will either help me in the field or mesh nicely with my background in natural language processing. Like I said earlier I really like language data and prior employers said having a linguist on hand was useful. I have gotten a few rejections from companies regarding data science positions but that has mainly been from lack of experience specifically in working with hardware and machine learning. 

Also, I was curious to hear from those in the field who work remotely or partially remotely. One of the main reasons I left my PhD was because I have a chronic illness that got so out of hand I was physically unable to work and almost went on disability. Luckily I found a great surgeon who has since helped me tremendously, but it's so important for me to stay close to him since my condition has no cure and I know I'll regularly need specialized surgery to keep it under control. I prefer working from home because it gives me the chance to be in pain, puke, and just generally feel shitty and try to make myself comfortable not around other people, something I've struggled with in past workplace environments and academia.

 I originally posted this to career advice, but I figured I might get more answers here. 
 I'll start this post by giving a brief background of my experience and education. My degree is in Statistics, but I have not been working in the profession for the past couple of years. 
 Currently, I am working for a Software as a Service (SaaS) company for almost two years doing work where I create programs that import data into a database and export it out to vendors in JavaScript and XML. I love what I do, but I really want to do more programming work where I'm actually creating and building things than just import and export programs. I did it for five years three jobs previous to the one I'm doing now for another SaaS company until I was laid off. 
 In between that time, I tried going down the data analytics route, and I found that I was bored out of my mind just cranking out reports in SQL and Business Objects all day long. I'm the type of person that likes variety in their job, and I became so bored doing these jobs that I started teaching myself JavaScript while I was at work and I loved it. After feeling that I was being severely underutilized in my previous job to the one I have now, I made the decision that the field just isn't for me. 
 In my current company, I have been trying to move over to the programming team where I feel like I can finally make steps to getting where I want to in my career. I had already been shot down once since I was supposedly too valuable where I was at. 
 Yesterday, I had a conversation with the VP of that department, and after telling him my background, experience, that I like what I do but I want to do more, and I have been building a project for the past six months to prove I have what it takes to make it in that department; he tried to convince me that I should just go into data analytics. His reasoning was that for every person with my skill set, he could find 100 developers. His other reasons were that the money was there and I could be creative in that field, etc. 
 At this point, it was really discouraging for me that despite the passion that I have for programming and having spent my free time learning Java and building something, that he would try to convince me to do something that I really have no desire of doing anymore. I really could care less about the money since I would rather be in a field that I happy in than making money in a field that I am not. 
 My reasoning back to him was that I found myself bored in the profession and that to get anywhere within it that field, I would need a master's, which I have no plans of wasting my time or energy on. I also said, however, that maybe I have a bias since my other two forays into the data analytics field I wasn't allowed to do any actual analysis since I lacked a master's. He said that not having a master's shouldn't be a barrier, but my experience and a quick Indeed job search say otherwise. 
 So I'm just wondering if maybe I am a bit biased as far as data analytics and maybe the field might be a better fit for me than I currently think. Maybe I had just a bad couple of fits and it made me jaded from the field. I just want a balanced perspective so I know I'm making the right decision for myself in the long run.
 Another perspective that I am looking for is maybe I should start looking for a new job since I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle at this company to get where I want to go. The company I currently work for is a very swim lanes oriented type of company, so I'm thinking that I'm going to be stuck where I'm at with no movement. 
 Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

I've been hitting up a bunch of ""sports analytics"" type conferences to try and get in touch with people who are applying analytics techniques to a sporting context, but I've been fairly disappointed with the depth of actual analytics individuals have had at the conferences I've attended.  Outside of the Sloan conference, there are very few people who are actually in the weeds. 

So, I'm thinking that I should maybe target some more computer science/machine learning conferences to maybe find some people who are more involved in the low-level analytics process.  

With that in mind, does anyone have any suggestions on conferences that they've attended that have a good mix of ML/analytics folks that isn't super-specific to one industry?  That last part is pretty important, just because what I do is kind of unique, so the more generalizable the conference attendance is, the more likely I am to run into some people that might make for good colaborators/network.  Preferably conferences in the US, but international conferences are viable options as well.

Im in second year CS and recently a Research Assistant for Data Mining and Analysis position just opened up at my university. Im really interested in going into Data Science and Analytics in the future and this seems like a very good opportunity. I need some advice tho to apply for this position. 
___________________

*The Job Details:*

This assistantship is ideal for an undergraduate student with some experience in computer programming, and who wishes to develop skills in data analysis or in interdisciplinary settings.

Tasks:
Developing scripts in python, javascript or other relevant languages for data mining
Manipulating SQL databases
Researching and experimenting to find the best existing tools to facilitate data extraction or analysis
Installing and maintaining server-side (on Ubuntu server) applications related to the research project

Required: 
- Knowledge and experience in computer programming in one or more of these languages: javascript, php, python, R.
- Good academic grades
- Capacity to work autonomously and collaborate in a team
- Basic knowledge of and interest for open source technologies and Linux systems 

________________

Now my academic grades are not that great, and for that Im doubting they will give me this position. But what Im willing to do is show them a sample project to show I have experience or knowledge of this and also to show that I am interested. Im also able to get a letter from my dorm coordinator to say ""I was homesick and didnt do well academically but Im fine now"".  

My skills are:
-HTML, CSS and JavaScript + p5.js library experience, havent used JavaScript for much heavy stuff, only made simple web apps like PigLatin translator, tip calculator and a flappy bird game but extremely simple(without all the cool graphics and menu screens, just involved a little ball flying avoiding obstacles. )

-Java. Did some android studio stuff, all my labs were the prof just throwing stuff at us, and quite a lot of people lost marks in this. I know how to develop a model class using a given API, a vague understanding of the MVC, and some understanding of arrays, hash lists, lambda expressions, inheritance, threading, interface, enums, static variables etc. A lot of this stuff I taught myself over the summer through online courses and haven't actually done anything heavy with it other than practicing alongside the instructor or making a JavaFX currency converter app. 

-PHP: very very basic, I haven't been taught this at university, I basically know the types of loops, assigning variables and some more basic stuff like echo. I do have used a guide to help me make a Login system on a web app with a user registration option and a MySQL database on the backend. 

-Python: also self taught, through a guide, did a little Loan Analysis through a step by step guide. I know how to import libraries, assign variables, loops, and then use matplotlib pandas and numpy to show data in different formats and munge missing data(this part i didnt really understand the point of but I just followed the guide). 

-SQL: I know how to create tables in databases. Pretty sure this is very basic. I also know a little scripting that can help extract data, manipulate it etc. 

-Im not sure what open source technologies are at all, i do know what open source means. I do not know what they mean by Linux systems interest. I do know how to use one and have worked on my programming labs fully in Linux(centOS). 

Now what I plan is, write a full report (almost like a ripoff of the guide I used but less brief and showing what I understood and how I implemented it) and providing it as a supporting document. I also plan on doing on of the ""yelp Data Analysis contest"" things and writing a report in it too. The job starts in a month and a half, so by then I plan to focus and learn more about python and data analysis. 

I also want to show deep interest in Data Mining and Analysis, but im not a very good writer or expresser so ill need help on that. 

Any help will be appreciated, and more questions may arise so ill keep editing this post. 

Thanks :D

I have read the readmes and think that this is a valid question and the right place, but am happy to be corrected :-)

I include a brief description, with questions at the end:

A colleague is looking at the ways in which data science is being used to best effect (or not) within the UK government. Some brief googling and examination of journals and blogs has shown that there does not seem to be any systematic list or analysis of the public sector's use of data and data science - I think there should be.

My initial search through blogs turned up the fabulous example of the [rogue train on the circle line in Singapore](https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a ""Singapore Train""), but I feel the slapdash approach lacks discipline and will lead to missing out.

Using a helpful Python library called BeautifulSoup, containing the IANA list of top level domain names, I wrote a [script](https://github.com/ababyyou/webscrapers/blob/master/int_use_of_data_first_pass) to find all countries who have a data.gov.**xx** website. The queries timeout quickly to start with, and some more may appear of I do a second pass with a longer timeout.

So now I have a list of countries with an obvious open data website name. But there are many more, such as France, who use non-standard(to my mind) naming, and many are not in a language I can speak fluently. Also - providing open or machine-readable data does not mean that they are doing anything with it themselves.

I have found a great list on github of all the repositories that are tagged as [""government""](https://github.com/github/government.github.com/blob/gh-pages/_data/governments.yml ""Github government list""), which is quite cool - and also alerted me to the fact that many federated countries have separate data portals for each state. Even more have individual city portals, so I need to look at a lot more than national level for my examples.

Still, my search goes on, and I will be more than happy to share the results, or indeed the cool things I have found that others might wish to use. My questions for the community are:

1) Could I be doing this more intelligently? It seems that other than running different levels of scraper, the analysis will be pretty manual and labour intensive. Perhaps I'm missing a trick that you could share with me for comparing similar but non-standard examples?

2) Is anyone else out there doing this? And do you think its a useful topic to explore?

3) Would you like to be involved? Or do you have any examples from your country that I might miss that you think I should be aware of?

Back in June, I started as an entry-level data analyst on a medium-sized analytics team. I'm curious to hear what advice you have for someone in their first year out of college.

A little about me: I work mostly in R and am a solid R programmer (I work 95% in the Tidyverse and routinely write my own functions to automate routine data munging). I also have a solid background in Python, SQL, Tableau.

A little about my team: The team has a few data scientists and a number of data analysts. It is part of a medium-sized company.

Here are a few areas that I have been thinking about targeting for my personal growth over the next 3 - 6 months. Any thoughts or advice on how to improve in these areas? Any new areas I should look at?

1. Technical Skills: I am confident in my data-munging/data visualization skills. I think the next big tool to add to my toolkit is predictive modeling/machine learning. Anything else I should look into?

2. Project Management: I still struggle with appropriately scoping analyses. I often want to dive into a larger/more interesting/more accurate analysis instead of one that has limitations but that gets the job done. Right now, I tend to present my manager with my ""dream"" option and my idea of a ""scoped"" version and let her decide between the two.

3. Identifying New Projects: There are lots of areas for improvement in the company which is exciting but also daunting. Do you have any advice for how to find an area that needs improvement, pitch an analysis to my manager, and execute it with minimal management?",16,46,False,self,,,,,

I'm a newcomer to data science and have been working on a project investigating NYT articles from 1987 and 2017. I used a naive Bayes classifier to predict which year a headline was solely on part-of-speech bigrams, and calculated the precision and recall to better assess the classifier. My understanding of this concept is not great and I was hoping someone here might be able to help me interpret the numbers.

Here are the results:

1987 precision: 0.6610486891385767

1987 recall: 0.7189409368635438

2017 precision: 0.703862660944206

2017 recall: 0.6444007858546169

My interpretation is that the low 1987 precision and low 2017 recall indicate that 2017 headlines are more likely to be misclassified as being from 1987 than vice versa. Does this say anything about the relevance of my features to one year over the other, if that makes sense? When I listed the models' most important bigrams, the top 15 were all found in larger proportions in 2017 headlines than 1987 headlines, so I thought there were a lot of strong indicators for 2017 headlines and therefore 1987 headlines were more likely to be misclassified, not the other way around.

Can you spend some time to help this fool decide on which paths to take on his perilous and somewhat expensive journey.\

I'm currently working as a web developer in Perth/Australia and are being moved into the role of a mini-project-officer role.  Work is relatively stable and that is why i have started to plan for the next decade.  

I have been doing a bit of research - and are considering the higher education path in order to pick up DS qualifications and skills (which doesn't always come hand in hand).  

Here are my options 
* Masters Degree at local U.  Which has a good enough reputation albeit a very very very young and untested Masters degree.  This option is probably the most expensive one - and the most lengthy and disruptive.  But i will get a fair bit more guidance and support.  The degree also comes with some forms of industry contacts and support and the local job markets are hungry for DS (or so they led me to believe).

* Online Masters degree from Coursera and the like.  Obviously not as pricey - but i wouldnt get any industry contacts and would be left to fend for myself.  

* Other smaller scale MOOCs (compared to the previous point) - definitely the most economic and in most cases the most effective as well.  But i would be left with no koalaficatons and no contacts.

*  Which leads me to the assumption that  a hybrid approach would work well then?  I could take a Graduate Certificate on the way towards the Masters degree to get my feet on the door whilst skilling up on MOOCs and the like?

I am hoping to leave academia for a data science job within the next 12 months and was wanting to get some advice on what skills to learn before I apply. I spend a lot of time programming in C, Matlab and Python for work however I am struggling to quantify my abilities relative to a computer science graduate. I have been looking at jobs and don't really know how to measure my ability against their requirements. I am currently reading some machine learning books and trying to fill in the gaps in my language skills. Since I work for a University, I am also planning to sit in on some undergraduate computer science lectures in the new semester. 

Just to summarise. Would my resume be able to compete alongside computer science graduates with experience in the field? What skills would you guys say are essential to learn? What lecture courses were particularly useful when you were studying? How deep of a theoretical knowledge is required for most jobs?

I have lots of interest in data analytics and trying to make predictions with data. My technical background is limited to VB, SQL and R. I will describe the two and then ask the questions I have.

Job A: 

- data scientist/software engineer position

- small company, unstable as the offer is ""contingent"" on winning a government contract, may be out of a job when contract is over

- lots of opportunities to learn (Python, Java, ML, developing algorithms)

- very challenging, very outside of my comfort zone

- very cut throat and stingy HR, little room for advancement / raises

- offered more salary, but probably ruined chances of negotiating more because my asking salary was so low and they went about $13K over my asking already

Job B:

- Marketing Intelligence Analyst

- very large and stable company, work the company does is very interesting to me

- great environment and people, beautiful office with lots of perks

- still lots of opportunities to learn for me, but probably not as much, they mainly use SAS and do things I've learned in school

- people who work here do not want to leave

- also less opportunity for advancement based on online research due to large size of company

- offer is $10K (~8K with cost of living taken into account based on locations) less than Job A, similar benefits

I think it depends on what I value more right now, but I also have some questions as well. Job A seems better for my career but B seems like a place I'd enjoy more. I've looked it up but I am wondering if I can get another perspective on the difference between a data scientist and data analyst. And if I chose B, how hard would it be to go from being a marketing data analyst to a data scientist just strictly by applying and not doing outside learning?

I am currently working on a data science project that I would like to share here to see if anyone wants to give me some inputs and suggestions. Up until this project pretty much all of my data science and machine learning experience comes from university, this is the first time I am challenged with a real world problem. Therefore I think it would be a good idea to ask some of you more experienced data scientists for some advice. I will start by explaining what it is that I want to accomplish and then my current modelling approach. I would be very happy to get any suggested improvements, links to similar data science problems and/or solutions or anything else that you think could help me improve my work.

The data I have comes from a customer database of a commercial online product. Each data point corresponds to a specific customer and contains a whole bunch of features. Most of the features are based on recordings of how the customer uses the product, but also some information that are available at registration such as for example referring website.

A new customer first signs up for a free trial that is not time based but instead based on how many times the product has been used. The customer then has the choice of subscribing for a paid version to be able to continue using it. Right now about 2% of all customers that signs up becomes paying customers. My goal is to build a model that given the feature values of a customer, predicts a probability representing the chance that the customer will subscribe for the paid version. This way it would be easier for the customer support team to identify the most valuable customers and hopefully by targeting these customers with calls, emails etc. be able to improve the conversion rate to something better than 2%.

The current model that I have built uses a snapshot in time of the feature values of a customer exactly 1 month after signing up. Given these feature values it then predicts the probability of that customer to subscribe for the paying version within an additional 5 months. I have tried different machine learning algorithms and the Gradient Boosting Machine seems to be the best performing one in this case so that is the one I am using right now. The model performs rather well on test data with an AUC above 90%. One problem though is that the number of positive outcomes in the historical data is rather limited so far, which I am aware of will reduce the credibility of the model. With my current model design I can only consider customers that have been signed up for a minimum of 6 months for training (as I do not know the outcome before then) which further reduces the amount of training data.

Now I am thinking about potential ways to improve the model design, both to be able to use a larger portion of the training data, but also to improve the benefits of the model. Right now I can only use the model on new customers that have been signed up for exactly 1 month. This is of course not ideal since many times you would like to target a customer long before 1 month and sometimes you will miss out on potential customers to target that stay quiet for the first month and then starts using the product more frequently later on. 

What would be ideal is a model that updates the conversion probability of a customer as the activity of the customer changes over time. For example it would give a prediction once a day or once a week based on the current feature values of the customer. I am not really sure how to build a model like this in a good way. One approach would be to treat the time since signup as a feature of its own. Then I would be able to get a prediction regardless of how long time the customer have been signed up. Another option would be to use something like a recurrent neural network to be able to catch time dependencies in the data even better.

I will stop elaborating on my thoughts here to keep the post length reasonable. As I said before, I appreciate any suggestions, thoughts or links to similar examples! Thank you for taking the time to read this!

I currently have a bachelor and a master degree in theoretical physics. (I'm specialized in numerical modelling/ computational physics/math, in particular for plasma physics)

I am working since 3 years as a software backend developer.

I'm quite satisfied with my job and I love computer science in general but I'm looking for something more tightly coupled to my studies and to theoretical subjects, like math, stats or physics.

I currently live in Italy but I'm looking forward to relocate to central Europe (Germany and Holland are my best choice)

Given my current state, would it be a realistic idea to transition to data science?

In this case, what would be a good approach for studying/finding a job? At the moment I'm currently studying a bit of ML (i.e. the Shalev-Shwartz book and the NG coursera course).

I'm also looking forward for a PhD in theoretical physics. In that case, the choice would be perhaps a better fit, given my background, and I read that doctorands are very well accepted in data science fields.

Do you have any experiences/advice?

This app needs to ingest and process high volumes of data periodically.

Currently, the approach I came up with is:

1. Wrangle the text into a document-term matrix (DTM)
2. Convert the DTM into a term-term co-occurrence matrix or TTM (using the algebraic trick of inner product multiplication of the transpose of the DTM by itself
3. Perform dimensionality reduction (PCA) on the TTM
4. Take the first k (let's say 50) principal components and construct a new DTM matrix where each term is replaced by a 50-dimensional vector space

I then use the vector space matrix as input for the ML model.

I'm 22 yo and just got my master degree in Financial Engineering (FE) in a pretty good school in Paris. FE is basicly a lot of Maths / stats / probas , Finance and IT (sql, R, python, C++ and some machine learning).
 I've also lived the past year in Riverside (SoCal) and got a diploma in Engineering Management from UCR. 
All my life I've wanted to become a trader, most of my friends from school are on the path to become one, but I recently totally changed my mind because I figured out I wouldnt have a happy life in this field. I then discovered and fell in love with data science and that's why I am here.

For some reason I've always dreamed about living in California (that's part of why I did my last year there). While studying at UCR I fell in love with a californian young lady (my gf now) , and I am now sure that I do want to live in Cali.

*already feel sorry for making you read all of this stuff about my life lol*

[the question] I'd like to know if it was possible to find an entry level job as a foreigner in order to pursue a DS career in California. 
Should I apply for Data Analyst or Data Manager positions first? or an internship?
how hard is it for a company to sponsor me for a VISA?
 
My English is almost perfect but sometimes I will have to look up some specific vocabulary and I'm scared that the recruitor will judge me based on that (I also have a french accent lol).
All the job offers ask for ""EXTRAORDINAIRY"" or ""SUPERB"" communication skills smh and I dont think I can meet that criteria right now. 
On the other hand my degree fits perfectly all the needs for a DS career...

I'm gaining a bit of traction on a side project I've been building for a little while around tutorials like this one: https://www.worldlybayes.com/tutorial_sample

The problem I'm looking to solve is that I see a lot of folks entering our field who have spent time learning algorithms and apis, but are missing critical skills needed to add value in companies (critical thinking, product sense, and systems design). I think this just do to lack of exposure and an absence of good examples (eg. there are lots of tutorials on how to use tensorflow for image recognition on MNIST, but very few on how to think about building a product around a deep learning model). So I've been writing a set of tutorials with more of a product development focus in the hopes that I can help out early career folks level up. The first 4 I have planned are:

- Building basic models (linked above)

- Generating feature hypotheses and iterating on a model

- Writing reusable and shareable code to get rid of cut and paste

- Using a database to back your modeling efforts

And then I'll see where it goes from there. I'm looking for feedback around the tutorials I've written: Are they understandable? Do they make sense? Do they seem useful? I'd like to make this as good as it can be and I think this group would be very helpful.

Our team wants to focus on the Deep Learning approach to general AI so we are specifically looking for people with experience and ambition to succeed in this particular field. Your position in such a group aids both the quality of it as a whole as much as it aids you to better yourself since youll have access to many other deep learners with whom you can discuss area-specific concerns. Of course, to create such a community we need to implement a safeguard in the form of an interview/ exam to ensure that we are both headed in the same direction. Bear in mind that down the line this chat-room is also a prospect for professional employment so your temporal investment will most likely also pay out in the literal sense, should you choose to engage in the commercial side of things.

This project will be a **paid** venture for anyone who chooses to assist in the development of any product that comes from it.

2. Is there somewhere I can find salary information on entry level DS positions? Most positions I see are for individuals with MS or PhDs so I am unsure where to look for salary references.

3. Has anyone had experience / success with contacting a Technical Talent Agency (the ones who look at your resume and try to place you at a company) in order to a DS-oriented job?

4. How can you get SQL knowledge outside of actually manipulating large data sets at a company? I have completed an introductory course on SQL but am unsure how to improve my proficiency in it going forward.

5. Should I be writing cover letters for each of my job applications? All of my CS friends keep telling me its a waste of time but I'd like your opinions instead if you don't mind :)

* Should I include SQL on my CV if I only have minimal experience? I can use run a basic SQL query with comparison and logical operators, but I can't do anything fancy.

* Does it matter that I'm not interested in one specific sector? While there are certain companies and areas that have perked my interest (e.g. FinTech social enterprise start-ups), I'm looking for a role that asks interesting questions of complex datasets in an environment that supports professional development.

There are also plenty of books, going all the way down to [Data Science for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Dummies-Lillian-Pierson/dp/1118841557).

But despite all that, if you look at job postings, they're almost exclusively looking for folks with at least one PhD.

My own feelings on the matter are that it's possible to get into data science without a PhD (I did it), but that graduate-level quantitative research skills are generally necessary for the job, and that it's exceedingly difficult to learn those skills without practicing those skills in an environment that matters.

Additionally, while I believe that programming skills are something most people can pick up from an online course (lots of great Python courses, and even a few R courses), I think that coding is just the tip of the iceberg -- a good data scientist needs to have a solid understanding of math and statistics so as to be able to develop a decent model, and those skills are much more difficult to develop through independent study.

Ultimately, I see these data science courses like I'd view a course on how to swing a hammer -- you might develop the skills needed to use the tools, but it's a huge jump from having functional knowledge on how to use woodworking tools and being a professional carpenter.

How does everyone else feel about all of the online data science courses, books, etc.?

Collaboration is a powerful tool. 

**The Vision:**

My vision for this is, to an extent, flexible and open-ended. Here is what I'm proposing at this point: 

* Put together teams of about five peers; people who have similar interests and skillsets.
* Each team will decide upon the team's project.
* Each team will execute the project, help fellow team members isolate and fill in knowledge/skill gaps.
* The results and process of the project will be published on the web. 

Part of my philosophy is that *doing Data Science* is the best way to learn Data Science. Learn Data Science the same way we'd train a machine learning model: apply, learn, apply, learn. 

Trying to replicate someone else's work can be an effective way to learn the skills required to create the work in the first place. It may also be possible to make a contribution to the work or created additional analysis output. I'd like to try to replicate studies like [this one](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6o0g-zB7-SnTVBRN1NQQ3NfcnM) or [this one](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6o0g-zB7-SnMzM5QWxXXzVtSFk). These are merely examples. 

It could turn into something big. Maybe we could eventually create a website where people can take a survey/test to get graded on skill level and interests and get matched up with people who also want to collaborate on projects. It could turn into something sort of like Toastmasters, but instead of helping people get better at public speaking, we'd help people get better at Data Science. 

I think that the teams need to be composed of about five peers. After selecting the first team, I'll start to pick leaders/organizers for additional teams. Each team will be independent, and we will compare notes on what we are doing. We'll start a Slack channel where everyone can communicate in a central location. Individuals will collaborate on teams, and teams will collaborate with each other in a [Team of Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486) fashion. 

A primary goal will be an exercise in technical / analytical skills, and another primary goal will be to exercise soft skills, e.g. project management and working on a team of like-minded individuals.

What is my motivation for starting this project? I want to greatly improve my skillset in this area and building a network of like-minded individuals is a powerful boost to this goal. That is it. 

**Ideal Person:**

* You are serious about evolving your data science skillset and you want to work with other people to do so.
* You're willing/able to spend a minimum of five hours per week working on projects that your team decides to work on.
* You are entrepreneurial, resourceful and embrace a ""fail forward"" and ""agile"" philosophy. I'm proposing that we build something here, there will be a lot of decisions to make and things won't always go as planned. 

I'm looking to create *peer* groups, i.e. [*a person of the same age, status, or ability as another specified person.*](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+peers&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS723US723&amp;oq=define+peers&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59.1448j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). I want to be the coordinator and a participant of the first group, so here is a description of myself: 


&gt; I'm a millennial interested in data science. I recently graduated college with a degree in Economics, studied math/statistics/computer science as well. I have a job as a business analyst at a technology company. I have several years of job experience (some before college). In my current role I'm basically creating a lot of descriptive statistics and wrangling data. My company doesn't have an analytics department currently, and I want to help start one at this company. 

&gt; The term ""Data Science"" [seems a lot like a buzzword](https://www.quora.com/Is-Data-Science-a-meme-term-or-a-buzzword) to me, so I'll be clear about what I think of when I use the phrase. Data Science is a cross-section between machine learning, computer science and statistics. A Data Scientist is someone who uses a variety of techniques to analyze data with the aim of finding insights in the data and/or building applications which exploit data. 

&gt; I've been writing Python for a couple of years now and I use the Python/Pandas/R nexus on a daily basis. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being a capable and experienced data scientist, my current skillset is around a 5. I think that going from 0-5 is a lot easier than going from 5-10. Technically, I'm at a developmental point where the challenges I face are less ""how do I get the program to do xyz"" and more ""what xyz do I need to use to analyze/model this data."" 

&gt; I'm interested in social issues like climate change, income inequality and money in politics. I strive to have opinions on these topics that are based on logic and empiricism. I see replication projects as a great way to 1) develop my analytical skills and 2) develop my views on things that are interesting to me. I'm also interested in business analytics applications (it is how I make a living). 


**How to Apply:**

Write a cover letter similar to the one I wrote above in block quotes. It must have these four things:

* ~500 characters describing you in general. 
* ~500 characters describing what you think about when you think about Data Science.
* ~500 characters describing your current technical skillset. 
* ~500 characters describing applications of Data Science which interest you. 

Writing something like this can be a good exercise in itself. Send it in an email to locking.it.down.806@gmail.com. Please include the phrase ""data science collaborator"" in the subject. I look forward to hearing from everyone. I'd also like to hear any thoughts. ",8,4,False,self,,,,,

Hi, all

I am graduating next spring with Ph.D. in Physics (high energy, CERN), and I am preparing a transition to data science. Initially, I was interested in Insight data science program, but recently I have learned about Springboard data science career track. Based on the reviews I read, both seem to be solid programs for the preparation for data science.

So I would like to ask a few questions for those who went to either of those programs or know well about them.

- what is the demography of these programs? I know that Insight requires Ph.D, so the most of people who apply to Insight must be people transitioning from academia like me. Is it also true for Springboard data science program? On the website, they only require Bachelors, so I am curious about the demography of this program.

- I am interested in these program mainly because of the possibility to build network and get to know people in data science field. Any thoughts on the difference between these programs in terms of network building (mentorship vs whatever Insight provides)?

- any thoughts on the quality of these programs? Any difference in terms of a position or companies that people got hired after completing either of these program?

Some worries that I've seen after doing research: The Kx suite that they work in is owned by First Derivatives so I'm not sure how truly useful this work experience would be anywhere other than First Derivatives. Additionally, there are a lot of complaints I see about the program, but I know that the people who are most likely to write anything at all are more likely to be those who had a bad experience.

I am currently taking some udemy classes in ArcPy, Python, an excel mastery course and power bi in my spare time. Would it be possible to break into data science with just udemy courses and a portfolio? Should I be learning SQL as well?

Lets say I had a dataset from an online shopping platform with the following tables:

**Transactions:** each row is a purchase made on a shopping website:

| transaction_id | customer_id | product_key | price | product_name | 
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------------| 
| 00001          | 3424        | 3254325     | 19.99 | ""blue jeans"" | 
| 00002          | 3123        | 3214321     | 3.00  | ""socks""      | 
| 00003          | 9982        | 2134551     | 33.33 | ""sneakers""   | 
|...|

**Classes**: A mapping of customer_id and true class:

| customer_id | true_class          | 
|-------------|---------------------| 
| 0001        | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| 0002        | non\_provlem\_shopper | 
| 0003        | problem_shopper     | 
| 0004        | problem_shopper     | 
| 0005        | problem_shopper     | 
| ...         |                     | 

## The Goal:

My goal is to categorize specific customers as ""Problem Shopper"" (addicted to online shopping) or ""Non-Problem Shopper"".

Is there a way that I can feed my transaction data as shown above into an artificial neural net and get predictions as of ""Problem Shopper"" or ""Non-Problem Shopper"" assuming I had a list of customer_id's that were true problem shoppers for training and testing. Like so:

| customer_id | true_class          | predicted_class     | 
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------| 
| 0001        | non\_problem\_shopper | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| 0002        | non\_provlem\_shopper | problem_shopper     | 
| 0003        | problem_shopper     | problem_shopper     | 
| 0004        | problem_shopper     | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| 0005        | problem_shopper     | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| ...         |                     |                     | 

I have experience doing binary classification problems with typical training and testing sets but in this case I want to use all of the information contained in the _transactions_ table but then predict the class by just giving the algorithm a set of customer_id's.

## The Question

How can I structure the data and/or neural net to learn from the entire transactions table _but make predictions solely based on the customer\_id_?

For context, I've been using neural networks built with tensorflow to quantify objects in microscope images that I've generated as part of my current research project. For training, I upload images from the microscope computer to a remote server via rsync (Xubuntu running GTX 1070s). Until recently, I heavily utilized Jupyter Notebook by forwarding the port pointing to the jupyter server on my remote machine via SSH to my laptop. I would start the server in a TMUX session which I connected to via MOSH, giving an incredibly responsive terminal.

Recently, I've fallen for VIM and have been using it with MOSH, TMUX, and vim-vinegar to manage my projects. When I need to either view an image output from my scripts or view a matplotlib plot, I cannot use the MOSH-TMUX session due to the lack of support for X forwarding in MOSH. I could run everything through a standard SSH, but I was hoping to keep the responsiveness/keep alive aspects of MOSH while still coding in vim and being able to view remote pictures via EOG/feh/ImageMagick. For pictures, I can open an X2Go session on my remote machine or open a second SSH session and view a picture remotely via eog x11 forwarding (not via MOSH). The first option seems a little excessive and clunky (I don't like taking my hands off the keyboard). The second option, even with compression, is very slow for large images due to my understanding limitations in how x forwarding draws images. Even worse is matplotlib outputs, as I have to run the python script from the terminal windows sporting the SSH connection with x11 forwarding rather than the MOSH connection.

Does anyone have a similar workflow with a more attractive implementation? Thank you and sorry for the word soup!",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Up until now I have relied on RStudio installed on my local machine to do data analysis tasks.

I am trying to figure out what would be the best setup for an improved performance on large datasets while still working in the R language, but I am kind of confused at the moment.

The company I work for are Microsoft partners so I guess I will use Azure HDInsight to setup storage and clusters. I think it would be a good thing to setup a Spark Cluster? But I am not sure what's the best way to connect to this cluster through R. I guess it can be done using a Spark package from RStudio, or I could use Microsoft R server?

Each of these corresponds to a particular item ID number and type ID, though I don't know which. The full set of item ID numbers and type numbers are very large, but known. The objective is to match a row from the descriptions table to its corresponding item and type ID.

An example of what the data looks like:

Description|
:--|
FT100-32/11-8|
gg782=okay|

These might match up with corresponding items:

ItemID|TypeID|
:--|:--|
FT100|32/11|
gg7|82|

In other words, the ""descriptions"" are usually some string which contain bits of the item ID, bits of the type ID, sometimes mis-spelled, sometimes incomplete, often containing a lot of other junk that isn't relevant. So for example, item ID ""F16"" of type ""32-b-c"" might be written in the description as ""F32bc"", ""F16/32bc"", or various other alternatives.  The format/structure of descriptions are not consistent either.

I've started with a horrifying number of regexes but there are just so many possibilities. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on a probabilistic approach which could give me likely matches based on e.g. string transformation distance. There seems to be a lot of literature out there for similar things processing natural language, broken up neatly by spaces, but what to do when your ""words"" are strings within random garbage strings?

I'm working on a small project in my free time on competitive gaming analysis. In particular, I'm looking at data for the Xbox One game, Halo 5: Guardians. In theory, my analysis could focus on any game, but this is what I'm working on, so we'll use it as an example. **My question is: how should I go about storing/accessing the data?** I'm looking at match events, which give you a play by play of what happened in any single game. The data is not homogeneous and isn't completely (or even mostly) numerical. For example, there's an event for when a player spawns, when a player picks up a weapon, when a player dies, when someone captures a flag, etc. Each of these events will have its own set of fields (for example, a player spawn event will only tell you who spawned and when, while a player death event has fields for the victim, the killer, each of their locations on the map, the weapons they possessed, etc). You can access this data using the API that the game developers have supplied. The data comes in the JSON format. 

I'm an engineer by trade, so I use MATLAB very often. While I have some *real* programming experience in C++ and Python, I'm much more comfortable with MATLAB, and I've been using that so far. I make the HTTP requests through MATLAB, parse the JSON data in MATLAB, and store the data in MATLAB proprietary binary files. I then load those files later and perform whatever analysis I want to, also using MATLAB. Now, I know the shortcomings of MATLAB, and I've felt them. Right now, I have to save each match's event files in a separate file, and call them into memory one by one if I want to look at them. I've identified over 350,000 games of interest, but I've only downloaded the match events for about 8000 of them. This represents a gigabyte in disk space (when saved as binary files). However, if I tried to load all of these files into MATLAB at once, it would take over 60 GB of RAM, which is more than the physical RAM I have on my machine, and thus makes any analysis exceedingly slow. I have resorted to only using subsets of the match event files at a time. 

From what I'm reading about other people's work in big data (which I'm not sure this would qualify as, yet), it is common to build relational databases, especially for data that is primarily non-numerical. I have no experience with databases or SQL or anything in that realm. Is that what you would recommend doing? I can imagine it would keep things tidier, though I don't know how it would stack up performance wise. I really have no intuition in this field, so I'm hoping I can gain some insight here. And I'm fully willing to start working in a different language if that is more natural for using databases.

Sorry if this question is too broad, not appropriate for this subreddit, or has already been asked. I did search for similar topics but I didn't find anything too closely related to what I want to know, and I didn't really know what exactly to search for. I really appreciate any and all feedback, and I will do my best to provide whatever details are needed to paint a clearer picture. Thank you very much.",3,9,False,self,,,,,

Indexing is commonly used among programmers. Without fully grasping the idea behind the technique, a programmer is always eager to take advantage of it whenever they encounter a query performance problem, only to get disappointed by the result on many occasions. By analyzing the principle of indexing, the article tries to show programmers when is the appropriate time to use an index and how to use it. 

Basic idea
The purpose of indexing is to quickly find the records where the value of a certain field is equivalent to a given value (find the right person according to an ID card number, for instance). For a data set with a certain scale (N rows), searching an eligible record using a full traversal needs N comparisons. If the data set is sorted by the target field (called the key for an index), we can use the binary search by creating a binary tree. This way the number of comparisons is logN (base 2). For example, only 30 comparisons are needed for a data set with a billion rows (2^30 comparisons if a billion records are traversed), thereby causing a great performance increase. The key values could be duplicated (find people according to birthdays, for instance); or there is probably a query according to a certain range of key values (find people who were born in a certain period of time). In both scenarios, the number of comparisons is bigger than logN but remains of the same order of magnitude.

To index data is to sort data.

Of course we wont really sort the original data set. Instead, we create an index, a smaller data set, which stores the key values of all records and the records positions in the original data set in a table sorted by the key values. If more fields are specified for key value searching, we can also create an index over each of these fields. For one original data set, multiple different indexes are allowed. But if the original data set is sorted and replicated each time when an index is created, the space consumption could be huge.

Database is designed to take data insertion and deletion into consideration when creating an index. An index with a simple sorting makes the insertion and deletion a costly process. For this reason, a B-tree is used to facilitate the data update. A B-tree is the result of extending a binary tree into an n-ary tree, with data still sorted by key values. (Well discuss how to create an index, which covers a lot of aspects, in another article; here we only focus on how to use them.)

There is a further way, hash index, which calculates the hash values of the key values in all records. These hash values are natural numbers falling into the range from 1 to k, and they can be used to locate records directly without a binary search. The hash method finds key values according to a specified exact value, not an interval, because the hash function isnt a monotonic function and doesnt show the original order of the key values any more. Yet the method is sufficient in handling many scenarios (like finding a person by ID card number). At its heart, a hash index is also about sorting, according to the hash values of the key values. The following discussion takes the ordinary indexing for example but the conclusion also applies to the hash index.

In view of how the index works, it cant increase the full traversal performance. So, its inappropriate to use an index to improve the performance of grouping and aggregation. 

Single-field Indexes
With a deep understanding about the idea behind indexing, we know the right occasions to use an index and how to write the code properly. 

1. It is very effective with a condition on key values, like finding the person whose ID card number is equivalent to the given value, or finding people who were born in a certain period of time;

2. Most of the time, it is ineffective if the condition is a function of the key values. Other times whether an index can be used depends on the degree of database optimization. Take a scenario where the index key is Birthday but the condition is people who were born on a certain day of a week for example. An ordinary index wont work because it isnt sorted by the days of a week. We need to create an index over the function of the key values. That type of index is supported by most databases. Another example is finding people who are in a certain age group with the index key as Birthday. We cant use an index directly, either. As there is a monotonic relationship between the age and the birthday, a properly optimized database may enable the use of index, which, however, is rarely seen. Besides, phrase a query condition directly over the values of index key, rather than over their function or an expression. 

3. It is effective if a general search condition separated by AND puts the condition over key values at the outermost layer, like finding people who were born on a certain date and whose names contain a certain character. The database will first filter out those who were born on this date using the index, and then find those whose names contain a given character. All modern commercial databases are capable of analyzing a conditional expression intelligently to find the part for which an index can be used to speed up the searching. But for a condition that finds people who were born on a certain date or whose names contain a certain character, the index becomes useless. Since only a traversal can be used for the second part of the condition, the database will skip the indexing to perform a traversal directly.

So it would be better to write the condition over the key values at the outmost layer of a compound search condition separated by AND. Performance can only be enhanced when the index key can be used to narrow down the searching range.

Multi-field Indexes  
Suppose we create indexes over all the fields involved in a searching condition, will that lead to a stronger performance boost?

The answer is a disappointing No, according to the idea previously introduced. In most cases, only one index over a single field is useful.

There are a search condition A=1 AND B=2, and two indexes created over field A and field B separately. First index A is used to find records where the value of field A is 1; but as these records arent ordered by field B, a traversal is still needed to find the records meeting the condition B=2. Well face the same situation since the records filtered out with index B according to the condition B=2 are not ordered by field A. A commercial database will assess the situation and choose an index whose filtered data set is smaller. 

Both indexes might be useful if the search condition is A=1 OR B=2. A properly optimized database has the ability of using both indexes separately to filter the original data set according to A=1 and B=2, and then performing a union.

We can also build a multi-field index over both fields. The result set after filtering according to A=1 is now also ordered by field B, and thus it can be further filtered using the index according to B=2. A database, if perfectly optimized, identifies A=1 AND B=2 and B=2 AND A=1 as the same condition, so the order of the different parts of a compound search condition is allowed to be different from the order of the index keys, though the situation discussed in the 3rd case in the last section should be noted: it is preferable that a condition on the index key is written at the outermost layer.

Yet the double-field index over field A and field B doesnt work when being applied to B=2, because an index ordered by both field A and field B doesnt necessarily ordered by field B. To find records according to B=2, the only choice is to perform a traversal. But a multi-field index tends to steer programmers wrong. In fact, a multi-field index over fields A, B and C is valid for conditions including A=?, A=? AND B=? and A=? AND B=? AND C=?, but it is invalid for conditions including B=?C=?B=? AND C=?. An additional index over field B or field C is needed.

Since a multi-field index over field A, field B and field C is valid for conditions A, A/B and A/B/C, should we create as many index keys as possible? It seems we should according to its principle. With an index table getting bigger, however, the I/O cost will increase accordingly. So the decision should come from a good assessment about a situation.

Index and traversal
Is a correctly created and properly used index a guarantee of performance boost?

Not necessarily!

The purpose of using an index is getting records according to key values. In most cases, a relatively small number of records are expected to be retrieved from a huge data set. On those occasions, a suitable index, if used properly, will surely give a big boost to the retrieval performance. On other occasions where a lot of records may be retrieved through a conditional traversal, performance might or might not be improved, even could be worse.

Here is the reason:

As mentioned earlier, we create a separate index instead of sorting the original data set. Data retrieved based on the index is not continuously stored in the original data set, even totally disordered if the database isnt properly optimized. Retrieving a large amount of discontinuous data from the hard disk will be accompanied by the retrieval of a lot of irrelevant data. The data retrieval time shouldnt be calculated simply according to the amount of data to be retrieved. More importantly, the performance increase brought by the use of an index is limited, not as much as expected. 

Retrieving data in a discontinuous way according to the index may cause duplicate data retrieval. For an HDD, it is most probably that a traversal is better than the index-based retrieval in performance due to a large number of time-consuming head jumps, if the result set is very large. Usually a commercial database will assess the cost before deciding the way to retrieve data. If any adverse conditions exist, the index-based data retrieval method will be abandoned. Generally the performance is no worse than that of the traversal. But if the cost assessment is not as precise as expected, a wrong data retrieval method may result in a worse performance. 
Generally the database data is stored in the order of insertion. If the order is in line with the order of the values of the index key, the data retrieved will be physically stored in a relatively continuous way. In this situation, the index-based filtering can bring a considerably performance increase, even if the retrieved amount of data is large.

-Bachelor's economics, 3.9

-Genuine interest in economics (&amp; finance), thought hard about grad school after Bachelor's

-Took up to intro discrete math during undergrad (Calc, LinAlg, DiffEq, Intro Proofs) to prep for grad school (did not take Real Analysis+)

-Worked in finance (equity research) after school for 3.5 years. About a year of this is working in the crude oil tanker space. 

-Quit my equity research job in 2015 (for various reasons) and I thought Python, R, SQL would help me getter a better job in finance. Began dabbling on Codecademy: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python. 

-Accepted to a two-year research **master's in economics** and accepted to a two-year research **master's in data science**.

**Questions:**

1. Which of these routes should I pursue if I want to work in macro research, MS Econ or MS Data Science? 

2. MS Econ will require (re)learning R and STATA. MS Data Science will expose me to MySQL, Python, and Java. 
Are skills like database management more important for macro jobs and thus will I be better off with Data Science or is R and STATA enough since econ grad coursework is more important?

So I just finished a MA in economics. Took several courses in statistics, including 2 PhD econometrics courses. Obviously, none of it covered statistical learning/machine learning. Thats why I'm reading ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R"" and I'm already in the last chapter.I feel pretty comfortable with what I read, since in basic theory and application  the grand majority of it is quite easy to understand. My issues are as follows:

1) First off, is there any difference, besides terminology, between statistical learning and machine learning? I'm somewhat confused by this, since I've read both that statistical learning is just a part of machine learning but also that its ""pretty much the same thing, with different terms"".

2) Where to go from here? My plan atm is to take a data analyst job to work more on my R and SQL on the job while learning python and more machine learning as well on my free time. I'm not sure how helpful the experience as a data analyst would be tho. Besides that, my issue is also what to read next when it comes to machine learning. My hope is that there is another book which is practical like ISL but covers the parts that it doesn't, like neural networks, so I can learn to apply it before working. I haven't found anything like this tho, sadly. If a book like that doesn't exist then I would have to move to deeper books(like ""Elements of Statistical Learning"") that take more time, so I won't be able to learn it before getting a job sadly. Admittedly however, I don't know if this is the right book either.

3) Lastly, and this is a more fundamental question, to what extent do I need to know SL or ML to work as a data scientist? Being able to apply the techniques is an obvious requisite, but with regards to the actual theoretical knowledge I mean. Would I need to reach a high enough expertise to do research on the topic or is have an understanding of the statistical theory behind it enough?

So those 3 are my issues, an answer for the 1st and 3rd and some suggestions with regards to the 2nd would be greatly appreciated.",10,11,False,self,,,,,

I'm planning to talk to a career guidance counselor at a community college where I'm picking up classes at for prerequisites for med school about this. I'd like to know the reasoning why people would jump into Data Science aside from the fat paycheck, because I don't want to be in a career where I'm constantly second guessing my choices.

tl;dr I'm a 20 something year old who didn't think of any alternative careers aside from being a doctor. I want to know why others are interested in Big Data.

I currently work in Facebook marketing, and I'd like to move into data analysis so that I can begin developing the skills and knowledge one needs for full-fledged data science. I graduated with a BA in Psychology, so as of now, I unfortunately have little in the way of mathematical or programming experience. Here's what I do have:

- One uni class on making basic games/programs in Java
- One class on using STATA to perform some relatively straightforward regressions and visualizations on large datasets
- Intro statistics (linear regression, chi squared, z- and t-tests, that kind of thing)
- Intro calculus (2 of the 3 classes that CS majors would typically take in their freshman year)
- A conceptual understanding of several ML concepts (thanks to a cognitive science class)

Before anyone asks if I'm really sure I want to learn this--some have expressed doubt in other forums--I have a deep interest in understanding how to implement DS/ML techniques. One can't put interest on a resume, of course, but I genuinely get chills when I read about the applications of DS &amp; ML to social good-oriented purposes, and it is a skillset I'm absolutely certain about learning.

As part of the interview process of a data science role, I have been given a take home case study.  The context is that the company has purchased data and want me to present my findings and recommendations to a non-technical audience. The problem is essentially a regression supervised learning but I think the predicted values themselves aren't as important as opposed to the rank of the predictions. 

Although I have a technical background, I have never done data science before (i.e. analyse a dataset, build models and glean insights) so I've been spending my last few days furiously learning R and regression algorithms.

Without asking for help to solve this specific problem, I'm hoping to get some guidance. 

My overall plan is this:

* Focus on learning 3 types of regression models due to time constraints (linear regression, decision trees, random forests)
* Investigate data, train regression models on the training set
* Identify which features are significant and understand if they make sense (I'm thinking this doesn't apply to random forest as they are more black box)
* Compare performance of regression models on the test data set
* Based on results, come up with summary of findings and recommendations in the business context

My questions are:

1. Does my approach make sense i.e. fit small number of regression algorithms, focus on findings and recommendations as opposed to fitting fancy models
2. What are the key things I should be focusing on when communicating results?
3. What does the scope of recommendations likely include? (e.g. data doesn't have much value so don't investigate further, purchase more data to get better understanding)
4. Is there a detailed tutorial for R on how to fit a regression tree using rpart in terms of choosing the parameters, assessing goodness of fit etc?
5. Is there an automated way in R to do stepwise regression for fitting a linear model?

Also open to hear how other people fared in similar situations. ",3,5,False,self,,,,,

I would like to suggest to each person that they search for jobs in a range. For example, range 11000-18000.

When I make a recommendation to a person, I know if they accepted the recommendation or not. Maybe 10% of users accept the recommendation. 

Now I want to make the recommendation that's most likely to be accepted. For example, with the above sequence I gave, maybe range 11000-18000 wasn't accepted but 11000-19000 *was*. This should incur a reward so that I'm more likely to recommend 11000-19000 in the future.

So far I have two ideas:

1. Take a few stats such as number of values, mean, median, range, 25th and 75th percentiles, etc of the distribution, and train a regression model.

2. Use a kind of neural network in Keras that can take multiple numeric inputs and outputs two values.

I have always been very interested in programming and somehow ended up in data science by learning python and R by myself besides school. As for this, I will continue learning by myself and developing a better understanding of data science from an economic/financial point of view.

My question is though, I see many of my classmates and career hungry old classmates joining these serious and not so serious student organisations, such as something similar to a Debate club, the United nations student association etc. 

And it made me wonder if this is really that important if I consider myself to be more of a person to learn actual skills such as coding and maths instead of organising a party or event.

So do any of you who already finished their studies in any similar field, find having experience in a student organisation giving their job/career opportunities a real boost even if you are already very skilled in computer skills and maths. 

Because I don't want to sound as a special snowflake or anything, but it seems to me that people are only joining these organisations to get their daily doses of social confirmation and unity, which I don't really feel like needing. 

So it would be great if any of you could confirm my thoughts or point me to the aspects that I am perhaps missing right now! 

Also, I don't have any friends or family in my close circles who went to university so it is hard for me to make conclusions out of this by myself.

Does experience in a student organisation of any kind, boost your career opportunities? or should I be more focussed on becoming a well skilled person in programming/maths/ data science as those aren't really things you can get out of a study organisation.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

In short, I want to become a data scientist. I have two degrees in engineering (BSE in Civil, MSE in Materials/Structural), have worked at two engineering firms in the past, and have just recently signed off as the CTO for a funded ed-tech startup. 

I graduated with my masters mid 2016, and only a month after graduation, I quit my job as a structural engineer (I was there for little over a year) to become the CTO/technical lead for an ed-tech startup. I figured I'd be a great fit, as I gained experience programming and general engineering know-how throughout my previous two jobs and schooling. I'd say my main accomplishments was that I oversaw the creation of a SaaS online product, managed to get the companies financials in check, and created some IP algorithms for use in acquisition of clientele.

While at the startup, I primarily did data visualization and modeling for several clients in terms of projections, growth analysis, and market research. I compiled data from several resources across multiple states, which is quite a pain when you're talking about preK-12 school data, analyzed it using Excel, and created some sound reports for my clients. I also did some good work in the financials department, creating projections and discovering trends to help aid in business strategy. 

I also have experience coding in both computational programming languages (C, MatLab, Python) and web-based programming (JS, CSS, HTML5 etc.)

**Why do I want to be a data scientist now?** I don't know, I guess I just like data, and unearthing something that may be there, hidden among a sea of numbers. I like to sanitize and organize, and find things that could tell a story. I also absolutely love programming. I truly believe I have the basic skills to become a data scientist, yet I am not confident I know what it is that I should be pursuing in terms of the technologies of today. *What programming languages should I know? What is an absolute must among any great data scientist? What am I totally not understanding right about the science? What can I do today to get me on the path of becoming a data scientist?*

But I wanted to take this time to introduce myself, and let known my desire to be a data scientist. In essence, what I am really asking is, what must I know now so that I can begin my journey?

Bit of background - I spent three years studying a BSc in Pharmacology but I've ended up working in Consulting within HR for the last two years (yeah, I don't really know what it is that I do either...). 

The one thing I've really enjoyed is doing some manipulating, analysing and reporting of data (albeit extremely low-level). These were mostly done in Excel. So I've been thinking all year and I have decided that I want to do **something** data-related. But because my study background is in Pharmacology and work experience is around Consulting/HR I really don't have any of the technical or transferable knowledge that other non-data professions have. For example, I've seen others here who come from a Mechanical Engineering background but they've done programming in C, Matlab, Python etc. 

The options I see for myself:

* Study a new bachelor's around data science. [There's a new University of Auckland Bachelor of Science in Data Science degree that started in 2017](http://www.science.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/subjects-and-specialisations/ug-majors/data-science.html) that I am thinking of taking starting next year. It seems to focus down Stats and Computer Science. R, Python, SAS, analytics and machine learning seem to be the gist of it. But studying this would mean investing 2.5~3 years and I will be 25/6 years old by the time I graduate.

* Study a Postgraduate Diploma in Statistics. This is just mainly a statistics PostGrad diploma. But being only a one year course, I doubt I will cover many topics in as much depth as the bachelor's.

* Give entry-level roles in data analytics or business intelligence (if I am even employable without some formal degree). Willing to start off doing basic querying, analysis and reporting, and learn more on the job.

* Also, online courses. But they seem risky as I don't know if employers will recognise them. Online courses seem to be recognised and popular in the US, but they still seem fringe in New Zealand. (any NZers able to chime in on this?)

So what do you guys think is the best option for me? I would like to study a whole bachelor's degree, but do you think there is some other method of compromise or a happy middle?

I would like some guidance please.

The data are a series of classifications made by different methods. I know what the classification actually is so I was thinking to give to each datapoint a color based on true classification and then plot it in a 3 axis plot each axis being each method used. In every axis there would be a designated space for every nominal result and therefore every point would have it's three coordinates.
If this can't be achieved, then a matrix for comparing 2 methods could work too.

What I am looking for is the tools and the strategies inside such tools that could make this possible.

I have a personal project idea. I want to analyze rap song lyrics in Spanish. I want to look for themes/subjects and sentiment. I also have a rough idea of maybe looking at sentence structure (like maybe just look at percentage of verbs/adjectives per sentence/verse/song and how that affects the ""feeling"" of the song ?). 

the challenges are 1) it's in Spanish and 2) it's rap so they use slang and other literary devices to express their ideas. 

I have an idea of how I want to approach this but I wanted to see if anyone else had any tips or suggestions. maybe share any troubles you found while analyzing some text yourself. 

also, I'm new at this lol. I have a degree in economics with a specialization in data analytics and economic analysis so I'm not like new new to the field but I'm definitely inexperienced when it comes to this. 
any help is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: I was thinking about using AYLIENS tools to do this? maybe the add on for Google sheets since I haven't used APIs before ",2,2,False,self,,,,,
