I wanted to reach out to this sub and see if first of all anyone would be interested.

Second I wanted to see what kind of a prize would be required before you would think about participating. Would a prize of $500 be enough? Would a prize of $1,000 be enough? Obviously these are not large amounts, but if you're already interested in the subject matter, maybe that would be part of the reason to enter.

Lastly, I wanted to ask whether you had any ideas for what the competition should be.

Also, I have a play by play database from the last 14 years that could be used.

So this is a feeler of sorts.

Thanks for your help.

The site is RotoViz.com if you're interested. We're mostly just self taught hacks trying to find numbers that will help us win at fantasy football.

I had considered computer programming as a career, but I've found working on web apps and mobile apps to be boring. In addition, because I haven't worked on many projects, took just one CS class, and just recently learned data structures/algorithms, I think it's going to take at least another few months of self-studying before I even have a chance at passing interviews for programmer jobs.

I'm now considering a career in statistics/data science because I miss applied math and number crunching. I only took a probability theory and stats course as an undergrad and used SPSS. If I wanted to get into data science, what's the best way to go about it? 

I'm already aware that most statistician positions require at least an MS degree. So whether I return to my program and get the MS in Physics or not, what do I have to do to compete with MS Stats holders for statistician/data scientist jobs? I'm already aware that I need to learn R and SAS (or should I just focus on re-learning SPSS?), which I heard could take just a month. After that, is it as simple as just running some experimental data or 2-3 mini projects and then I can send out resumes and have a chance at jobs? How do I find ideas for what projects to work on?

I work in a programming / data science capacity and need to communicate results to business users visually in chart form.

The extent of their expected interaction is limited to zooming in and out and populating the chart with selected time-series data.

I have no experience with data visualization tools for non-programmers, but have experience with Python, Java, and R.

The user's preferred method of accessing this visualization is via our intranet with their browsers. Imagine something like Google Finance. I'm prohibited from using CGI or other server-side tools to get this done, so if I were to go this route the processes would need to be self contained within a browser - something which I know absolutely nothing about.

2) *Lots* of MATLAB, some Python. Past languages include x86 assembly and BASIC

3) Important courses taken that may apply to DS:

Computational Intelligence

Pattern Recognition

Stochastic/Probabilistic Systems

Unsupervised Learning

Image Processing

Matrix Theory

I'm a bit of an unlikely candidate to do Data Science, I know, but bear with me. I graduated with my BA in History, and I realized at the beginning of my senior year that I didn't want to do academia. Thankfully I had taken a intro CS course as well as a Stats course, so I began picking up coding then through sites like codecademy, udacity, and reading books. With my hobbyist interest (and a fair amount of luck) I got into a top data analytics program where I'm starting in the fall. I'll be working in the engineering library where I'll be working with hard math grads and professors to help crunch data while working on my own side projects. 

I've so far self-taught myself Python, R, and SQL though I feel most comfortable with R so far. I've messed with the big Python libraries like SciPy and Pandas, and I've done some independent data analysis on Magic: The Gathering tournament results. I'll be taking classes about data/text mining, information retrieval, evidence based discovery, machine learning, informetrics, and natural language processing. I plan on learning more statistics on my own, too. I should add that I know how to mess with small data sets in Excel, and while I haven't actually used the Hadoop ecosystem I do understand the theoretical functioning of it.

Am I on the right track? Is there anything else I ought to be doing? Does my BA just totally screw me?
