I'm also wondering - does anyone know of any non-cliche cover letters? Most sample cover letters I've read are incredibly cliche and don't reveal anything that distinguishes the person from the hundreds of other people who are probably competing for the same slot.

I'm interested in fellow reddit user's views on when Data Analytics or Data Mining has misrepresented you as an individual or your tastes/interests etc. The big question could be, ""how would I know,"" but it may be that it has been evident to you by nature of retargeted advertising as you have surfed the web or engaged with tools/apps. Have you unwittingly been the recipient of advertising that has completely misrepresented your intentions or expectations?!

I'm interested in collating some amusing anecdotes from the community for our site, which likes to show the good, bad, positive, humorous etc side of the continued devotion to all things Data.",0,1,False,default,,,,,
