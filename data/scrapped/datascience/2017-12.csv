It's not a post-grad certificate; technically you can do it straight out of high school if you have the right math credits, but most students have at least some college before starting this program.

The presenter seemed... not to put too fine a point on it but ... f%$ing insane.  She went on and on about how there are fewer good secure jobs with benefits these days (which is true) and how graduates of this certificate with no experience walk into jobs paying well over $100K, and those who do the fast-track intensive certificate (full-time for one semester) walk into jobs paying like $150K.  Apparently they benefit from the ""immersive"" experience of it, or something.  She made it sound like this was the last best hope and a sure thing for a secure, well-paying job.

To me, these numbers seemed nuts.  I know some data science jobs pay those numbers but isn't that more for experienced people with master's and PhDs?

Another weird thing.  I asked a simple yes/no question: Could I just take some of the courses without doing the whole certificate?  She answered with a lecture about how employers want the full certificate and she's heard ""horror stories"" from students who regret just taking a few courses, how I wouldn't progress in my career without it.  She motioned to me while saying that women over 35 (which I am) have an even tougher time in the job market, she's just being honest.  WTF?

When I got home I looked her up and found out she is actually a French professor who somehow is now the director of a group of certificate programs at this university.  She has no analytics background and no apparent qualifications in labour markets either.

Later we got some time to talk to a couple of the instructors in the program who weren't terribly impressive.  They just kept repeating that how you do in the program depends on how much work you put into it.

Is it just me or does this sound like a train wreck?

Asian countries import oil from all over the world. For some fraction of that total, they have flexibility in deciding where to import it from. Of course price is a large component of that decision. Concrete example: in August, Hurricane Harvey shut down refinery operations in the US Gulf Coast, creating a large overhang of unneeded oil. India and China bought most of that oil at a big discount, and reduced their intake of oil from the Persian Gulf. The US oil was a better price, so they switched.

There is price-sensitive switching like this throughout the world.

I am trying to systematically identify the most significant and common switching flows.

The data I have:

I have a database, since 2015, of every individual ship voyage that moved crude oil from one location to another throughout the world. I can aggregate it to tuples of the form (month/year, originCountry, destinationCountry, totalVolume)

I would like to identify meaningful switching patterns in this data.

Confounding elements:

Markets are constantly changing, so switching patterns that made economic sense in 2015 might not make sense today, when other patterns emerge.

Oil markets are growing, so these switches are not zero-sum actions, where an increase in X results directly in a decrease in Y. If Chinas refinery demand is growing, next month instead of increasing Persian Gulf imports by 100k bbls/day, maybe it only increases 40kbd, and instead takes an incremental 60kbd from North America.

There is seasonality to refinery behavior  they have cycles of refinery maintenance and seasonal demand and are also sensitive to general market conditions (overall price).

The source data is very granular, so there are lots of minor, noisy movements that arent meaningful.

Some countries are semi-groupable. Many of countries in the PG export similar types/prices of oil.

My first solution idea:

I know the main destinationCountries that Im interested in. For each originCountry that sends oil to that destinationCountry, take the three-year monthly time series of imports and calculate some rolling average, and std-deviation of the imports over last N months. Then I can calculate the z-score for each monthly (date, origin, destination) tuple.

With those Z-Scores, I can try to look for sets of originCountries where postitive Z-scores for (originA, destinationX) are correlated with negative Z-scores (for orginB, destinationX)

What else can I try?

Im suspicious that there are more skillful ways to look at this problem with modern data science approaches. These are fairly subtle signals buried in a lot of noisy stuff, so my primitive approach doesnt feel sensitive enough. What other approaches would people suggest? One concern I have is, this is not Big Data by any sense  three years of essentially monthly data. So I fear that limits the techniques that I can deploy.",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Hello everyone, I am a CS major with an internship where I am doing web development, basic stuff, Laravel/PHP, MySql, Javascript. 

I am interested in data science/analytics, and I had the idea to try to implement it at my internship (for one I can get paid while I learn about it and see if I like it, and also will look good on my resume :) )

So far, we don't really have anything like that here, we have a team that does some SEO, Google Analytics type stuff, but I have overheard them talking about ""data visualization, data science, data analytics"". 

I want to try to get in on that...but I have no idea where to start? Should I look into programs like Tableau? I am completely new to all of this (hence why I am grouping data science/analytics/visualization together, not sure on the major differences between them)

Does anyone have any advice on how I could get started that would provide value for my company? The company I work for has many locations, we provide sales/services for people, so we have sales data, franchising data, etc.

Thanks!

I have seen some reviews of Springboard's Data Science Track, but I have yet to see a review by someone who has completed the curriculum and is in a similar position to a lot of you guys hoping to enter the data science field. For a bit of background about myself, I am a recent-ish college graduate in an engineering discipline. I worked for about a year as a business analyst before deciding I wanted to shift gears into data science.

&amp;nbsp;

**Application**

For the application process, there were a few typical short answer questions (e.g. why you are in interested in data science). After passing that initial screen, there is a shortish technical portion conducted online consisting of coding and statistics. The statistics portion is reasonably simple (multiple-choice) and doable if you remember the basics from any previous statistics course you've taken. Otherwise, a quick review of an AP Stats book should suffice. The coding portion would be difficult without any programming experience but is doable if you've taken an introductory programming course. Luckily for me I had recently went through a programming and statistics course recently so had no problems.

&amp;nbsp;

**Curriculum**

During my time in the program, the curriculum was changed, so I will be reviewing the newest curriculum updated around August this year. The curriculum now heavily relies on DataCamp for a lot of the modules, so I'll give my thoughts on both DataCamp and the Springboard curriculum as a whole.

&amp;nbsp;

I think DataCamp is fantastic. As a member, there are many courses to get you started in data science, from as simple to importing data and getting started with pandas to building simple neural networks with Keras and Tensorflow. I found the in-browser coding paired with short lecture videos to be very effective to get practice with the key parts of data science problem solving. Their lessons are definitely more geared towards practical experience and will get you going with scikitlearn and Keras/Tensorflow. Developing deeper understanding of some of the machine learning methods used would require other sources. For a membership fee of $30/month to DataCamp alone, I think it's a slam dunk deal for someone who is not quite sure where to start. A beginner should be ready to try his or her own project after going through the DataCamp classes.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the Springboard curriculum. The remaining materials of the Springboard curriculum is all taken from publicly accessible sources with little to no effort placed in creating supplementary materials or vetting the material. For instance, many videos are Youtube recordings from PyCon conferences with not the best audio/video quality. I think it would have been much better for Springboard to make some videos covering perhaps similar material but improve audio and video quality and create a more cohesive curriculum instead of many disjoint unrelated videos. Another example was a statistics assignment with a blatantly incorrect solution posted in Springboard forums by a moderator. It took months before it was pointed out by a student and even then it took much back and forth before it was acknowledged as incorrect. After going through the recommended Khan Academy statistics review, it was clearly incorrect to me and yet it took a long time before it was resolved. Also, none of the assignments have answer keys provided to students, so there is a very limited way to check your work.

&amp;nbsp;

The machine learning unit's videos and assignments are almost entirely taken from a Harvard class. The assignments were useful to get practical examples to refer to, but a few select lectures from the class was definitely insufficient to develop a solid understanding of machine learning techniques. Perhaps I've just been spoiled since I dabbled in Andrew Ng's Coursera amazing course previously. I felt a lot of my understanding of machine learning is from that course and independent research for the Capstone projects (see below in Mentorship).

&amp;nbsp;

**Mentorship**
I think the primary value of the Springboard program is the mentoring provided. First and foremost is your personal mentor with whom you have a 30-minute call weekly. My mentor was friendly and knowledgeable. As a part of the program you must complete 2 Capstone projects, independent projects undertaken with the guidance of your mentor. My mentor provided really helpful feedback and advice for lot of the machine learning methods I tried and gave me a starting point to create neural networks for my projects. My only criticism is that my mentor did not follow along with my curriculum progress very well; when I had issues with curriculum assignments, he would be unfamiliar with the notebook and wasn't able to directly help. I can't speak to all the mentors in the program, but I was satisfied overall.

&amp;nbsp;

The career coaches are available for 30-minute calls for things like resume or Linkedin reviews. I thought they were all personable and reasonably helpful so no complaints. I didn't get any extraordinary advice from them but it's always good to have someone read over your materials as second opinion. As the program winds down, you do a few mock interviews with other mentors to graduate the program, and I had good experiences with these mentors as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**
I think the Springboard track is definitely more effective than self-study but the real question is whether or not it is worth the $1000/month price tag. You are getting about 2 hours of expert project guidance a month, a $30/month DataCamp membership, and compiled free resources. That's a judgment call for you to make, but I personally do not think there is enough value to warrant the price tag.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Not worth the price tag though mentorship is good

Feel free to ask any questions if you have them!

This is the best sub I could find to ask my question.

We have an event coming up during which there will be a best dressed contest.

We will only be able to decide the nominees at the event as it will depend upon their attire at the event. And We will determine the winners at the event also.

The problem is favoritism, as all attendees are from our company and the attendees will be voting, we face the problem of them possibly simply voting for their friends / Department colleagues. 

Are there any strategies to 
1) Decide nominees that minimises favoritism 
2) Decide winners that minimises favoritism 

The only constraints are that there will be 6 winners (3 male, 3 female) and that only our company employees can be involved in the nomination / deciding the winners. It should also be practical.

I'm working on a large data set project and I'm unsure of how to go about completing what I want. 

Basically, I have a big data set of various location addresses (about 1,500 total) with three primary attributes and a set of 1-3 sub-attributes for each. 

What I want to do is plot these locations on a map of the United States in a way that I can differentiate based on attributes. Then, I'd like to apply a radius market of about 15 miles for each. 

I'd be happy with that, but if there were a way to overlay/apply a filter with population density data for the region that would make things a lot better. Maybe the best way to do this would be to start with a map of the US that was already by population density? Or just do it by State which may make it easier.

(Hope this is the right place for this)

I have an MS in Chemistry and have been teaching various chemistry labs at a university level for about 10 years. Been looking into relocating to a place that doesn't have many chemistry teaching jobs (Vermont), and I am finding my skillset to be woefully inadequate for basically any other job in the pay range I'm looking for, even though I am very good at my current job.

So, I'm trying to update my skill set and bought some udemy classes in Python and Data Science/Machine Learning. I do have some experience with programming so I am confident that I am capable of learning python and being able to use it effectively. 

A couple of questions:
-Are positions common for someone who is capable but doesn't have a formal degree? What could I do to improve myself in this area. Taking formal classes is out of the question both in terms of time and money (have 3 kids and full-time job).

-Could my background in chemistry be seen as a boon for someone getting into Data Science?

Any help/advice you could provide would be very helpful!

We actually can set up a local store with a few samples from the database, and then run this script on that to test the migration. It's never been an issue.

   Hi, recently I'm really interested in data analysis area and was fascinated by deep knowledge of Statistics. So I've decided to become a data analyst/scientist in the future, but most of people around me seem to have a Masters degree in Statistics for the sake of it. 

 I'm a just international student in my university (3 years of Bachelor degree - Double majoring in Statistics/Computer science ) to graduate one more year to go, and my university has a excellent department in Statistics. I've studied basic theory of Statistics/Data modelling and know how to run basic database by using R-studio, SAS, SQL, Python. 

 However, the problem is, my family doesn't seem like in situation to afford highly expensive tuition fee for postgraduate, especially when you're an international student. And I'm not planning to go back to my country and study in there (The entry in postgraduate is quite defensive and exclusively working if you don't have Bachelor degree in there). 

 So I'm trying to find a way how i can get in this field without Master degree. My plan is to involve any project related to research area and join Data science club in my university so to be able myself to expose that area.
 But I still have no clue what would be the key to become a desirable candidate in this field. Any advice please?",13,2,False,self,,,,,

 - Calculus
 - Linear algebra
 - Probability
 - Statistics (these two might be combined)
 - Optimization
 - Numerical methods

Let's follow the following format: everyone suggests only textbooks that he or she personally read and found helpful. Ideally, a brief explanation of why you find this book superior would be great. 

Some more parameters:

 - Suggested books don't have to target specifically at math used in data science (have the ""data science"" in their titles).

 - If possible, books are the preferred format. There's no doubt that there are plenty of outstanding courses, but I have always been better at learning from texts.

 - There is no limitation on whether the book should be open source or not. That said, high-quality and free resources are a perfect combination. 

 - For some reason, shiny magazine-like textbooks don't work for me (and probably for others). 
""The Cartoon Guide to Statistics"" is often recommended, for example, but I find it very hard to read and can't even treat is seriously as a learning resource.

 - I totally can't stand textbooks where the author addresses his readers as if those were toddlers (or idiots) by all means avoiding anything challenging. 

 - The reader has a thorough grasp of basic algebra, as well as everything covered in a typical precalculus course

NOTE:

You can ignore all the parameters outlined above if you think that your suggestion is really good.  

Why do I need this?

I am often told that I should consult with a specialist, but I get totally paralyzed when there are too many options from which to choose. The same applies to my data science learning plan. Having received detailed recommendations on the best data science learning resources, I have managed to create a well-structured learning plan for data science (at least, the essentials). 
Yet, every time I encounter a data science article or post I understand that my broad but shallow knowledge of mathematics is a limiting factor. I am ready to put a lot of effort to build the necessary foundation in math: primarily in linear algebra and statistics. 

Eventually, I believe that we could create a structured learning plan for math used in data science and machine learning based on the discussion here. The question comes up increasingly often on Reddit.

I have a dilemma. I graduated this summer from a double degree in mathematics and finance. I'm quite nerdy, love programming and maths etc.

I took a job in a fairly small city in northern europe (around 1 million ppl). The job is at a consulting firm working as a data scientist. The job ad wanted someone with heavy maths skills, wizard programmer, statistics ninja, etc, you get the point.

I got the job and got an ok salary, not great with any measures. In the beginning everything was good. I got my first consulting job and went out to a client for a 1 year project. The firm that I'm working with now is a quite conservative industry company.

The first month I was really enthusiastic, wanted to implement machine learning everywhere and do cool stuff. I think everyone just thought I was annoying. I stopped with this because of all negative responses. Now I'm working in 2 projects:

- In the first one I'm basically doing undergrad lab reports. Histograms, time series plots etc. I'm getting no credit for anything and I have no meetings, nothing. Just some ppl emailing me to change the y-axis on a histogram to percentages instead of no. obs. etc..

- In the second project I'm supposed to make empirical models for a machine. I'm supposed to deliver a quite advanced ML model by myself, no one discusses anything with me and I have to work in matlab. I cant even use python because its's a company policy. They cant even provide me with licenses for matlab atm so I nee to use my student license and export code in matrix form... Also there is no data structure for making models, so I need to click my way through GUIs for hours to get like 200 observations.

Everything just feels so shitty... Not getting credit for anything and doing boring stuff.

Sorry for the rant but i don't know what to do. Seriously.. I'm thinking of working until the contract is over and then ask my consulting firm to move me. Or maybe do a Phd instead. I'm really sick of working with ""American Pie Guy""-engineers that cares about nothing and have no interests.

Any suggestions? Anyone been in a similar situation?

I'm also thinking of moving abroad, somewhere with more cool jobs, and enthusiastic people.",59,5,False,self,,,,,

I am from engineering background and currently in first year of my PhD in Finance. After attending courses over here during my PhD I have a mixed feeling about investing 5 years towards a PhD.

I always wanted to pursue a career in data science, my view was to do research on application of data science in finance and then work in industry. I am from technical background and know programming as well. (Although I have just started learning data science relevant language Python). But then I am not having motivation now to go ahead with PhD.

I am planning to drop out of PhD and invest next 6 to 8 months in a data science boot camp and get a job in industry. My view is even if I land up an entry level data science job, in next 4 years I would have enough experience to get into good position. I am confused about the trade off between these two choices. 

PS. I am 32 yr old and hence really confused about these mid life career choice.

I have degrees in finance, I.T., and math, with minors in computer science and economics. I feel I am a strong coder, with a breadth of languages. Data science is the direction I want to head: it plays very well to my skill set, and it's a career which I think I'll actually enjoy.

Last summer I applied to 5 programs (some local, some online). My top 2 choices were Berkeley (MS in Data Science) and TAMU (MS in Statistics). I got into TAMU, but not Berkeley - I am scheduled for a feedback phonecall with Berkeley to see what went wrong. I have a feeling it was my GRE scores, which weren't amazing - I have my reasons, but it is what it is. Suffice it to say, reapplication would likely mean a GRE retake. My GPA was stellar (I graduated with triple honors) and I think my essays were on point.

Here's the rub: I'm starting to think it may have been a good thing not getting into Berkeley. This has nothing to do with the quality of Berkeley's program (which I'm certain is excellent), but more about what data science programs cover and what the market is doing. Here are some bullet points from my perspective:

Data Science Pros

- The Berkeley brand power is immense; this is a driving factor for me.

- The program curriculum looks very complete, despite its youth.

- Program access for life.

- Cutting edge and very buzzy.

Data Science Cons

- Much more targeted degree; almost vocational.

- The portability of this degree is questionable.

- The hireability of this degree is questionable if we were to see a recession.

- Claims from employers that data scientists are coming out of programs ""half-baked,"" where they know how to push buttons but can't apply (or even state) the theorems they're using properly.

Statistics Pros

- TAMU brand is formidable.

- Program is well established.

- Very portable degree in a variety of jobs.

- The hireability of this degree is far less questionable during a downturn.

- Several success stories of individuals completing this degree and supplementing with inexpensive data science courseware to achieve a data science-related job.

Statistics Cons

- Program is far more theoretical, less codey.

- Perceived as ""boring"" by some employers; doesn't maintain the buzz factor.

So here's the question: do I retake the GRE (which is 3 months of study on top of job and school) to try for Berkeley again, or do I gun it for TAMU and take some DS online courses along the way? Assume cost isn't a factor...

Help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7iuncj/with_several_somewhatrelated_degrees_and_certs/,mikeh77,1512921308,"Hey everyone! So for a brief background, I've got a BS in bioengineering, MS in a bio science, MBA, Six Sigma Black Belt (ASQ), PMP, and an IT mgmt cert from a Univ... I say ""somewhat-related"" to data science in the sense that they are all technical areas heavy in statistics, business, and IT. I've been doing operational-related process improvement and data analytics for a large distribution/manufacturer now for the past 6 years.

I've always had a massive interest and passion for machine learning, visualization, and telling stories from data. I was one of the pioneers in the efforts at my firm to get our legacy system COBOL data into SQL, and taught myself SQL, VBA, Visual Studio, and SharePoint because I saw the need. Since then I'm now a company expert on all of these things, and I'm the go-to guy from senior execs if they want a complex dashboard or to understand any of the big data in the company. I'm looking to pivot from my current food distribution company into the tech industry as a data scientist.

I've reached out to old colleagues in the tech industry and they confirmed my own research, which is that ""data scientist"" may mean very different things to very different firms. That said, it looks like it would be wise to study Hadoop, tableau, AWS, and R from the ground up. As for Python they said I should strongly build my skills with scikit (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib) which is something I've had superficial exposure to. One colleague said I should definitely emphasize the ""self taught"" bit on my resume as well. They said bootcamps are an option (though they seem incredibly expensive), and I've discovered pluralsight which I signed up for as well which seems more affordable. I've heard very mixed things about udemy.

For people in the field and those familiar with hiring expectations, do you have any advice on where to start? Is it realistic to pivot into this role given my background? Are bootcamps necessary, and if so, are there any that aren't $1k+? Are other certifications wise, i.e. from Microsoft or some other certification body?

I mostly stick to proof automation so forgive me if I'm misstating something. Anyway, for the problem:

I've been given ~1million flights and each flight has the following variables and more (25 total):


Variables | Description
---|---
Data queried | The date the company received the flight data
Departure date | The day the flight departs
Return Date | The day the flight returns
Class | like business, first, economy, or economy plus
Refundable | True/False
\# of available seats left  | -1 if the flight is full or overbooked
outboundstops | The number of stops for connecting flights I would assume?
LOS | I'm assuming this means ""length of stay"" and the data confirms this
total | the total cost of the flight
merchant | the ticketing authority that provided the ticket

...and so on


So I'm being asked to find some interesting facts for the consumer like: When is the best time to buy? When should I fly? Should I buy now or wait? What should I be paying? Or any other interesting questions to answer.

**So my questions are:**

Do you have any resources on how to go about predicting flight prices? I've read a couple articles so far but haven't really encountered any algorithms or practices to adhere to.

What other questions do you think would be interesting to answer in the report?

As an amateur what mistakes should I avoid on this project? Or what tips would you have?

I'm planning on using Orange, Pandas, and Scikit -would you suggest any other languages/packages?

Hi, all


As one of my first data science project, I was testing different regression models (random forest, gradient boosting, etc..) to predict apartment rental prices. What confuses me is that the output of any of these regression models fluctuates a lot that it is hard to compare the performance of these different models.

For example, I was using mean squared error and learning curve to measure the performance of RandomForestRegressor. With fixed parameters such as maximum features and number of estimator, sometimes the model overfits data, and sometimes it doesn't.

The samples I collected has 5 important features (location, bedrooms, etc..) and ~20 binary features as dummy variable. The total sample size is ~3000.

Is this common problem in building regression model? Or is it because the sample size is small? I would appreciate any insight into this.


Thanks!

I have a general question on text mining regarding a business case. Note sure if I understood the concept of text mining 100% but let me explain my issue:


Imagine you need to analyze and categorize insurrance contract agreements as pdf-files.

For example the contract contains a statement like: ""cancelation of the contract is possbile after death"" or ""cancelation of the contract is possible whenever you like"". In that case I would categorize both statements into the ""cancelation"" categories plus a furhter subcategory needs to be created for ""cancelation -&gt; death"" and ""cancelation -&gt; free"".

 

Imagine now, another sampled contract would contain a sentence like ""the termination of the contract is only possbile when the agent passed away"". (sorry couldn Thing about something better Smiley Tongue).  In that case it would fit to subcategory death but only content wise.

So far so good, I guess manually creating your dictionary would be possible.

 

My question is now: Is there any automatized/ ML-learning approach to categorize this classification dictionaries without manually defining and categorizing sentences?

Maybe it is possible to ""train"" a dictionary ML algorithm?

 

And in case, which Software can handle that?

I'm currently debating between choosing a Data Analytics MPS from Penn State and a Masters in Engineering, Data Science Specialization from UC Riverside (jointly NASA JPL). 

My end goal is to become a Data Scientist, but I'm thinking the UC:R program will be more difficult for me personally, without much of an engineering background (BA in economics, have worked as an analyst for 2 years). I was wondering if the MPS in Data Analytics would be just as useful for my career goals, since it would likely be the program I feel more comfortable/experienced with at the moment (plus I'm working full-time as well -- don't have a lot of free time).

I guess what I'm wondering is: How big of a difference might these degrees make one way or another? If I'm applying to Data Scientist positions, would they value the Engineering/Data Science degree significantly over the Data Analytics degree? Does anyone have any advice or comments about either of these schools/programs? 

I'm sorry if this is not an appropriate place to inquire about such a thing, but I don't know where else to go for help. This is a really important decision and I have 2 days to decide. I appreciate any and all advice greatly!",3,0,False,self,,,,,

So here it goes.  I recently graduated with my PhD in Vision Science (my project was mostly on eye development and neurophysiology), and started doing my postdoc. The people I work with are wonderful, and the environment absolutely great - but somewhere at the end of my grad training and beginning of postdoc, I realized I don't want to be in academia anymore. I don't want to scramble for grants, crank out publications, go through hundreds of mice, and get paid &lt;$50k/year for the next 5 years while I hope beyond hope that I can get the elusive faculty position and live a life of complete madness.

The favorite part of my job is, and always has been, data analysis.  I love working with data, thinking about it, visualizing it, running statistics, determining the implications, considering metrics and relationships and all of that. I love opening a spreadsheet full of numbers and figuring out what to do with it and what it all means.  I love presenting my data and explaining concepts to people who aren't necessarily experts in my field.  I think I'd love being a data scientist.

So, I'm thinking of making a career transition, and I wanted some advice.  I am very knowledgable about biology (developmental bio/neuro/genetics...etc) and the fundamentals of statistics and data analysis.  I feel like I am better at statistics than my lab peers, but I'm not quite at the level of a bio-statistician.  I'd say I pick it up fairly quickly though.  I have a basic working knowledge of MATLAB, though I wouldn't consider myself a programmer by any stretch of the imagination.  I'm familiar with SPSS, but don't know (yet) how to use R.  I am a bit of an Excel wizard, but from what I hear, Excel can't handle the volumes of data that I would be handling as a data scientist.  I don't know anything about SQL (yet).

My question is, given my background, would I be a candidate for an entry level data science position that has something to do with health/biotech?  Would I need a lot of training/experience with R/python/SQL before applying for jobs, or is there on-the-job training?  How does one go about finding a job like this (LinkedIn? Recruiters?)

But on the site, they told me to set up an AWS p2 instance. I live in India where the cost/hr is really high, when converted from dollars. I was under the impression that this would be a course in which I could do the computations on my local machine. Granted, I don't have the greatest laptop in the world( GTX 950M), but if it takes a little bit more time in the computations, I would be fine with that if it would save me some money.

1. Does the entire course assume that you are using the p2 instance, or are there instructions for local machine users also?

2. If using my local machine won't be feasible, is there any other good Deep learning course which is similar to this one, and hopefully doesn't use an AWS instance?",15,4,False,self,,,,,

It's a small/new company so no one is doing this currently. I'm in a lucky enough position to have access to all data in the company and would like to try and get into that sort of work.

I figured this would be a place I could find such people lol.

My background: biomedical engineer, worked in med devices R&amp;D doing various things. design, risk management, operations, eng data analysis (frequentist approach).  Got interested in AI so started taking MOOCs. Now work in finance/health industry as a ML dev.

My role is to research &amp; explore various methods to apply AI to various use cases. Currently I use a combination of traditional time series analysis as well as ML. As I continue research to refine our approach for these use cases, we will (hopefully) scale this out.

In my previous experience the end goal (what's the product?) and process (how to develop &amp; launch product?) are largely predetermined and rigid. Uncertainty is largely operational which exists when doing anything in industry.
In my new role, the end goal is documented but there exists significant design uncertainty. This combination of uncertainty has given me a taste of what true research is like and it's bloody awesome!

My long term goal is not to get a specific role, but rather acquire &amp; grow a set of skills that can be used to solve cool things that motivate me. I'm doing this currently at work but in the future feel as though I should focus on leveraging my biomed engineering knowledge.

I have found most of the jobs that seem to have this nature are labeled scientist or researcher positions and require PhD's  

* I only have a bachelors degree, I have taken graduate classes haphazardly in various biomedical disciplines but never for a degree.

* I can rectify this with taking an online masters degree in CS/applied math while continuing to work in Industry.  I would gain no research experience and it would just be a statement on my resume. Would this bridge the qualification gap at all?

* go back for a PhD. Would love the work involved, however I am too far removed from academic research that the opportunity cost does not seem to be in my favour.

Here is what I understand from this paper so far:

- The models purpose is to predict a future value for any of tens of thousands of possibly correlated time series of sales of retail products, when there is much missing data due to zero sales, and seasonality, and sporadic marketing promotions, and greatly different quantities sold depending on item by orders of magnitude.  

- It is similar in purpose but not design to Amazon's model known as DeepAR (2017).

- Missing values are imputed by matrix factorization.
To implement the matrix factorization part of this new model, in my opinion it may be possible to directly call to the model trained using Generalized Linear Regression Model (GLRM) in the machine learning software available at http://h2o.ai

- Matrix factorization: Missing values are naturally well-addressed (cf. movie recommender systems), unlike ARIMA

- Temporal dependency learning. This may be a novel advancement, because it was not achieved by earlier matrix factorization-based solutions for time series.

- High dimensional time series are addressed, unlike ARIMA which does not scale, apparently.

- Wal-mart was a named sponsor of this 2016 paper on temporal regularized matrix factorization by Yu.  Wal-mart is a rival in retail business to Amazon, whose scientist Flunkert developed the 2017 paper DeepAR.

- Faster decoding of trained models might be expected on this algorithm versus the DeepAR algorithm because of the linear structure and the absence of deep learning, while accuracy might be similar.  (To be determined)

- My opinion: It might be an important paper.

- Data

1.8M examples

1963 commodities (items), 5 regions, 14 months

25 indicators: sales, page views, selling price, units, 

Partitions for modeling (nomenclature in paper is different than shown)

Training: Jan 1 2015 to Dec 13 2015.

Dev: Dec 14 2015 to Dec 20 2015.

Test: 

Input: Oct 28 2015 to Dec 20 2015.

Predict: Dec 21 2015 to Dec 27 2015.

84-day dataframe (# days in one example) was empirically found

- Model

Forecast the sales, given the item, region, for 7 days.

4 matrix (channel?) input. Each matrix is a time series:  item, brand, category, geographical region

4 CNN filters (throughout?) causes 4 outputs. # filters is made to match to 4 input channels. f=7,4,3 at layer C1, C2, C3.

CNN of 3 simple layers. 3 x (CNN, pool) -&gt; 4 x FC (n=1024) with dropout -&gt; linear regression.

1D convolution of each input individually

We intend to capture the patterns in the week level at the first order representation, the month and season level at the second and the third order representation respectively.

First phase of training: Train on all regions together. Second phase transfer learning: Initialize to weights found in first phase, to train different model for different region, always using same network design (n-siamese?). 

Cost function:  mean square error, Weighted examples more heavily nearer the day of prediction

Optimization: Batch SGD, Adamax

Input normalization: z-score

- Comments

All TS are independently modeled. Cross-learning from different series is nonexistent. Pure autoregression(?)

There might be information in cross-learning of TS, where correlation exists for example.

After a good bit of reading, I am quickly learning that the topic is much more complex than I thought it would be.

I have been using Jupyter Notebooks for documentation of this sort of thing for a while.  I love the format and repeatability, and I am a big fan of the data science tools available in the Python ecosystem.

In a quest to find some low-cost tooling, I was able to find that `scipy.stats` has a lot of functionality involving distributions, but does not support censoring.  I also found a project called [`lifelines`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lifelines) which initially appeared to have what I needed, but then doesn't really in retrospect.  There are some other items out there that had bits and pieces of what I was looking for, but nothing that really hit the nail on the head.

After some searching, I found a [github repository](https://github.com/tgray/weibull) that actually contains a significant portion of the functionality that I am looking for:

 - analysis of current data
 - test design tools

Unfortunately, this appears to be a one-and-done project.  I forked it into [my own repository](https://github.com/slightlynybbled/weibull) and have done a significant refactor to ease the use of the functionality contained within the original package and have been fairly successful up to this point.

I could really use some eyeballs and some assistance.  It would be great to get some confidence limit functionality along with a log-likelihood estimation method for larger datasets.

If you already have `statsmodels`, `scipy`, `numpy`, and `pandas` installed, should be able to simply `pip install weibull`.",2,8,False,self,,,,,

Also a few questions:

* Given my background, what type of position should I be going for? I don't think I'd be able to land a true data science position. Should I aim for just any data analyst position to get my foot in the door? How about business intelligence?

* What skills are worth picking up before I graduate in May and start look for employment? I have pretty minimal experience with SQL so I'm thinking of putting some time into that but I'm not sure what else.

* Is it worth leaving GPA on there? I don't especially like the way it looks but I'm afraid if I leave it off it, the assumption would be that I had a subpar GPA. Especially since I don't have any real work experience.

* Would it be disingenuous to list my degree as Masters in Applied Statistics instead? I think it more accurately represents the program but I don't know if its frowned upon to make a change like that. 

* I'm comfortable with R and only beginning to learn python. I'm not sure what the best way to list this in my resume would be. Is it worth it to have a skills section where I just list those two? How about experience with postgres? I've only used very basic commands.

I'm partial to pytest, so I'm hoping for some examples using that library. 

What I'm especially interested in:
- for practice, I'm trying to develop a few recommender algorithms (like from sklearn-surprise) and I'm struggling with organizing everything. Most functions can't be tested just by passing in a few magic numbers... I'm needing to pass in whole test data frames or numpy arrays. I'm loading things into fixtures right now, but there's got to be best practices that other people have already developed, I hate reinventing the wheel. Is there a good book or tutorial or... something... where I can read more about this? Have you implemented custom algorithms with proper unit testing for a collaborative environment? What do you do to deal with the fact that this stuff isn't so easily decoupled from the data as other software engineering problems? What's a clean, easily readable, modular solution for connecting different training/test features/targets with my unit testing functions?

Alternatively (or ideally?) maybe you know of some open source projects using pytest as a base that you can point me towards?
 Surprise uses a janky custom file format, and sklearn uses it's own generator to create datasets... which is fine, but I can't help but feel like someone's got to have come up with a cleaner solution. If not I'll just cobble something together, but I hate reinventing the wheel when someone else likely has a better solution for me to use as a model. If you've written/know of a git project with really well organized and implemented testing, I'd love to see it. 

For what it's worth, I'm aware of engarde, hypothesis, and feature forge, but only that they exist, not so much how they can help me. Feel free to give me a kick in the pants towards one of them if they're actually what I'm looking for. ",5,10,False,self,,,,,

For starters, I hate those long run-on files that are difficult to debug. I like small discrete functions.

So in R, I generally have a load_data_xxx function for each data object. These load the data into global variables if they don't already exist, otherwise, they do nothing. The upside of this approach is that plotting / transforming functions can call the required load() functions and ensure all necessary data is loaded. This facilitates small functions that can be individually developed / tested for just their specific functionality.

In addition, it enables me to organize functions into separate files and just source them appropriately for each file. If I want to debug a transformation function, I can just run the (for example) transform.R file and it will source/load everything necessary for the functions to run. (And not, for instance, include any plotting code.)

I know, global variables are bad, but in data analysis, one it usually only loading a small handful of raw data objects and transforming them as needed for analysis or visualization. The key is flexibility in exploring the data, often at the command line, to determine next steps.

Now for Python (which I'm working to learn, specifically using Spyder):

Global variables don't seem to really exist, they are essentially module level variables. Sometimes they are available between modules, other times they aren't, I'm struggling with figuring them out, even when the variable appears in Spyder. So it sure seems that my preferred pattern is not going to work in Python.

None of the strategies found online seem to be promising and I feel like I'm staring down a single file that includes all of my functions.

Any suggestions?

I really want to become a data scientist and would appreciate some guidance on the best strategy I should take. I really enjoy statistics, data analysis, computer science and solving real world problems, I know I have the drive and passion to do it However, there is a lot of work to become competent in this field and I want to know what I can do to get ahead.


 
About my background, I am graduating in this upcoming spring semester from the University of Illinois with a bachelors in Engineering Physics. My degree is flexible as it is not pure physics, so I was able to take a couple 400 level stats/probability classes along with a few cs courses, one of which being data structures which is regarded as the schools flagship course for cs (I am taking it this spring as I just finished all the pre-recs).
I know how to code, but would by no means consider myself an expert. I have been spending a lot of my time trying to sharpen my skills in python but would only call myself intermediate at best. Since I am not a cs major I feel behind in this aspect compared to other students pursuing data science. Any advice on specific areas I should learn would be really helpful.


 
I started a little project over thanksgiving to scrape eBay and get sales data of certain collectible cards, because I noticed there was a lot of arbitrage and I am knowledgeable on the topic. I bought and sold 1 item already and made a ~25% roi, it was cool to me and inspiring to keep building. The program will be designed to scrape eBays sold listings page and takes all the relevant data on the item and put it into a multi-dimensional array. From here I want to figure out how to constantly store and update the lists, to have a rolling list so I can have data reaching back further than the 3 months ebay gives you. Then I can find price margins to flip the cards and see how the price moves over time. Since there are literally hundreds of viable cards to trade, this program will really help me sort through all the data and gain valuable knowledge. It is still in its early stages, but it currently can scrape the data from the sold page and put the right data into an array. Now that finals are over I will spend more time progressing it.



This project is the only thing I can use to separate me from the competition. I have no internships in data science and I had a rough first year when I transferred here so my GPA is not the best, although it has risen significantly this last year. once I graduate I think the best thing I can do is to get an internship to get more experience and train up my skills before I think I am qualified enough for a real job. I am going to spend this winter break filling out applications and working on my project and hoping that someone will take me.



I have filled out some apps already and have a coding problem for Akunas internship position due this week. I dont think I am a strong enough canidate to get the position, but I want to attempt the coding challenge for the experience and to learn what areas I need to study more to get up to par in terms of python each test/interview/application teaches me something to make myself a better candidate. 
Anyways, this was very long but helped me to lay everything out. If you happened to take the time to read all this and have any advice as to what I can do to make myself a better internship candidate or advice towards getting a job, I would greatly appreciate it. Also if there are any specific things you think are essential to know in terms of python that will help me in my future, I would love to hear them. 

I also am highly considering going to grad school to get a masters. it would be in computer science, financial engineering or some other related field. I would only explore this option after i take a year off and practice coding, create projects and hopefully intern.

I graduated in 2014 with my MBA. Our operations track was called Supply Chain &amp; Analytics. The software packages I worked on through my grad work were SPSS, JMP, Mathlab, and Crystall Ball. I believe there may have also been regression modeling software apart from what I listed but I do not remember. I worked for a renewable energy company doing nothing but spreadsheets in Excel.

At the end of 2016, I moved back to my home state due to health issues in my family, now resolved. In that time, I have applied to over 1000 jobs, mostly in BI intelligence (had a screening interview today), process improvement, and project mgmt. I have not landed a full time permanent role. Some of this has been due to salary differences in the Midwest and South but I think part of it is I may be an ill fit for the roles I am applying to.

I have been able to work a few temps jobs, one where I was leading a group of 10 people for 3 months in a record reconciliation/scanning project. I was also able to acquire my GAIQ (Google Analytics) cert and take an online SQL Beginner's course.

Long story short, with the skill set I have laid out above, should I apply to data science roles? I do not have any programming experience and, other than watching demos of Tableu and Power BI, do not have any recent experience in visualization software.

TL;DR: I'm interested in how you transitioned from an analyst role that mainly uses more GUI based technologies, such as Excel, to a role in the data science field.

More specifically:

1. Given your current role as {{Title}}, what specific skill do you think benefited you the most? Was it more programming side, such as knowledge of Python, Pandas, etc? Was it more computer science side, such as algorithms and data structure? Or was it Data science specific, such as machine learning, deep learning, etc?
 
2. What resources have you use to learn the skill and what would you recommend/not recommend?

3. For those who came from a role that mainly uses excel, or other similar tools, what role did you transition into? What skill specifically helped you transitioned from one role to the next? 


Finally, a bit of background. I work for a small consumer packaged goods company (20 people-ish). My day to day work mainly focus on excel. 
In the past 6 months, however, I've begun learning python. Currently, I'm using python to scrape our internal reports (written in PHP, and outputs various HTML tables), then uploading them to a Postgres database in AWS, and wrote a flask web app that connects the app to the database in order to generate new HTML tables. I've hosted the web app on a Digital ocean vpn.
Along the way, I've learn some python, flask, multiple flask packages, postgres, nginx, gunicorn, and quite a bit about pandas.
 
The issue I'm struggling with right now is what path should I explore further? Given that I eventually want to work in the data science world, I'm not sure if I should dive deeper into learning python (algorithms, data structure), or I should go ahead and start learning about machine learning and such?

I have 6+ years of experience data working in traditional data warehouses as an ETL developer, Data Analyst and a Data Architect. I've worked on 3nF data warehouses and built and enhanced many Kimball style dimensional data marts. Past couple years I have been doing more solution design and data modeling than ETL development.

Here is the current technology I am experienced in: 
* Relational Databases : Can write complex sql as well as plsql scripts, store procedures, database triggers etc. Most of my work has been with oracle databases but I have also worked with other vendors throughout my career.

* Informatica: This has been the ETL tool I am the most familiar with. I no longer do any hands on ETL development but I work closely with developers as I give them the specifications on what to build. I also get in there and debug from time to time.

* Business Objects: I have never been a report developer and have worked mainly on the database side. However, BO has been the reporting tool that all the teams I have worked on have used so I am familiar with it.

* Erwin: This is the data modeling tool I use.

Now that you know where I am coming from maybe you can give me some advice on how best to pick up ""modern"" data engineering skills. I am aware of what is in demand in the market and have been proactive do self study, creating a list of technology to pickup. This is what I have picked up so far as well as plan to learn in the near future but because I don't use these on a daily basis I consider my level to be be that of a beginner:

* Python: I know the syntax and the fundamentals of the language. I've also spent time with some popular libraries like Pandas and Numpy. What should I really focus on specific to data engineering and maybe data science? Ay resources you can point me to?

* AWS: I've signed up for the free tier and have gone through the majore services (s3, dynamodb, ec2 etc.) What services should I really focus on here and can you point me to some good resources? I already use acloudguru.

* NoSQL: I've done a course and played around with DynamoDB so I understand key/value and documented oriented databases. Should I spend time learning MongoDB or do the concepts transfer over easily? Any other tips you can share? I also plan to play with a column oriented database.

* Spark: I have no experience with spark. This is next on my list. I plan to do some courses that leverage Databricks. Any tips or resources I can use?

* Redshift: I haven't yet played with it but intend to. Any tips? I assume most of learning this is conceptual coming from row oriented databases and I should be able to pick this up fairly fast. Any thoughts?

* Tableau: I've messed around with the community edition. This is really low on my list.

So what do you think of my approach to pick some of these skills up. I'm using whatever resources I find online (udemy, pluralsight etc) to learn this tech and practicing on my local machine or in the cloud when possible.

In my experience I think self learning can only go so far and there is no substitute for working on actual deliverables with a team. My aim is to get to a point where I won't be deadweight and then just apply for jobs that utilize these newer skill sets.",10,21,False,self,,,,,

I just graduated with a B.A. in economics a few weeks ago with a minor in CS. I accepted a great offer to be a data scientist at a fairly large, established company that I interned with during college. I was super excited about this position because I know how rare it is for someone without an advanced degree to get an opportunity like this. I was doing data analyst work during my internships, but I expressed interest in moving into a more data science oriented role, and they saw the need for it in their business as well.

I have 3 concerns:

First, from what I saw as an intern, the company has fairly low ""data maturity"". There aren't really company wide standards for data entry/storage, so even putting together low level visualizations in Tableau could be a struggle that took weeks due to having to consult with dozens of different domain experts and cleaning data and getting access to the many databases that different groups in the company stored data in.

Does anyone have experience being the sole data scientist at a company? As the company's first data scientist, how do I 

(a) do my job effectively in an environment that's not very put together data-wise? It's important to me that I showcase the importance and usefulness of predictive analytics so that I can keep my job and hopefully encourage the company to hire more data scientists in the future, but this seems difficult knowing how much of a struggle it will be to even get our data to a point where i can start making models. Do I just have to resign myself to spending my first year or so evangelizing best data practices? 

If evangelizing is up to me, what can I do as a new entry-level employee to change practices at a large company, and how can i generate value in the meantime? 

and 

(b) avoid being grouped with the large teams of BI analysts already working there and end up doing a bunch of SQL/Excel work? I made it clear that I didn't want this to be my role, and my employers made it clear this isn't what they want from me, but I can see a scenario in which I struggle to do useful things to delineate me from the analysts and end up receiving the same work as them.

In the long term, I'm hoping to either move up at the company through the data science team expanding, or move on to a position at a company with a more mature data science team.


Second, educationally I feel unprepared with regards to machine learning. I only took one course in my last semester on ML, but didn't get much out of the course due to a professor who didn't seem to care much about it (and honestly a little bit due to my senioritus as well). I'm pretty confident in my general statistics and computer science knowledge, however, but could use some review on the ""applied"" statistics at work in machine learning.

What can i do between now and my start date (mid Feb) to catch myself up? My current plans are to go through the Introduction to Statistical Learning textbook (which is what we used in my ML course) and then do some courses on Coursera. I'm also planning on getting some exposure to Spark, which I haven't used before. 

What I don't like about this plan is that ISLR teaches in R, and while I'm comfortable in R i'd prefer to work in Python. Also, I may be wasting my time since i know the basics of ML, but need to review and deepen my understanding. 

Are there better educational resources for someone in my position? 

Third, is there any long-term future for me in data science without going back for an advanced degree? What does career progression look like for an undergrad? 

Thanks for your help.

I have had an interest in data science since learning about AlphaGO's big win, and recently have been given the opportunity to do a fast-track workshop through U of T which 'ports' STEM majors (I finished in Biophysics) into the financial industry. 

The thing is, I'm really on the fence about it. At first this workshop claimed that a $100 deposit was all that was needed. If they find you a job in DS, then they will garnish your first 35 days of pay to cover the cost of training. If you don't, or don't finish the workshop (as I later discovered) then you are on the hook for about 6k. Its a bit of a gambit. 

I've tried to look at the Toronto job market for this, and its as expected - lots of work for CS majors or people with masters degrees or lots of years of provable work experience, but not so much for entry-level work. I know that a lot of these sorts of positions aren't advertised, and wanted to defer to an objective source (People that might be working in Toronto or know they lay of the land better) how easy is it to go from a physics major to something like data science and finance? Are there ample opportunities? Most of all, is a brief,  4 month workshop in Python, Java, Stats and R as well as Finance sufficient to prepare a science student for this sort of work?

From pictures on the workshops site, I can guestimate that about %60 of the people who took the workshop found employment. That's pretty good, but with the potential to not be among the %60 (if say this market is already becoming saturated with talent, as we speak) and lose 6k, I'm weighing this carefully. 

Anyway, your thoughts would be really appreciated on this.

I've finished the earthquake analysis and am moving on to the hydrothermal temperature data set. Installed at the bottom of the volcanic complex is a 3D temperature array. The array is a triangular frame as seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/jcOtP0g.jpg) and it consists of 24 thermistors that have been recording temperatures above a vent in the seafloor for the last 3 years. 

The data logger on the array records a sample every 10 seconds from each of the 24 thermistors. This resulted in a ridiculously large dataset (several million points for each thermistor) that I have resampled to 1 sample/60 seconds and may end up resampling to 1 sample/5min. 

I've done some preliminary Fourier analysis and as expected there are diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal signatures. The majority of the power is in the semi-diurnal tide.  I have some simple visualizations using MATLAB's interpolation functions and slice viewers.

In my philosophy book, it talks about using statistics as a justification for argument, and it brings up a problem where someone is both a republican and a resident in a certain neighborhood. The statistics for how likely republicans are likely to vote is this one number. But the statistics for how likely residents of that neighborhood are likely to vote, is another number. Which means you don't know how likely that person is to vote based on the information alone and you need to do some critical thinking to figure out what is going on. Surely, this is a sort of a problem that will arise when data scientists try to gather together numbers to make predictions.

Now imagine you are assigned to predict--- which political candidate will win an election. The data that can be collected include-- race, physical attractiveness, how much people love him, how much people hate him, how many times he has shown up on tumblr, what his age is, what country he comes from, how high pitched his voice his, how many times he has worn a tie, what his favorite food is, if he has a rubber ducky in his bathtub or not---- thousands upon thousands of factors.

I have a bit of an unusual question. And sorry for some rough edges in the text as English isn't my mothers tongue.

First of all, I'm not coming from a Data backgroud. I'm an IT (mostly Linux) admin at insurances most of my work life (about 10 years now). But I really want to change some things and got into the whole Data Science matter more and more (also thanks to this sub).   

So I checked if there is a role like this already in my company (a fairly big german insurance, but with old structures), but they only had a DWH project to initially start collecting data started 2 years ago without much drive.  
I spoke to the project lead and she told me that she want to go further in this field but there is no prework done on how the role for a data analyst in my company could look like. And I should try to define the role and also a path to get there skillwise to show them my motivation.  
  

Now I'm sitting here trying to define the whole thing. I try to kinda work this like a data analysis project (Analyse the problem, collect data, ""transform"" data and show results) to show her my motivation.  
But the biggest problem is, that I never worked as DA. I already found some pretty good courses on how to get there but that won't help me on defining the role inside the company.   
  
So maybe you can give me some insight on what your daily life looks and maybe even somebody already working in the insurance business could give me some tipps. And what skills are needed for this job (except R or Python, I mean like social skills etc.).   
How much of the business model of the company do you have to understand? Like in my case how insurances are calculated? Or only which key numbers are important?   

I know this request is a bit vague, but every help is appreciated.   
  
Thanks in advance.

Although the universitys FAQ is quite comprehensive, there are a couple of things that I would like to understand a little bit better.

I know that UIUC delivers a masters degree so I do not expect to get it for free, but at the same time I have a day job and a family so its important to evaluate whether the study time is manageable. I could afford to spend about 8 hours per week (possibly over 4 years, there's no rush), but if it's more than that I am heading for a divorce.

Back when I only had one resume (my finance resume) I was told by a few software developers that they had no clue I was competent at programming until after talking for 10 minutes with them. I want my DS resume to fix that weakness. 

I am open to any and all feedback including career advice. If you think I should pursue finance over DS i'd like to hear your reasonings too.

I'm a student, finishing my IT masters degree and learning data science in my spare time from an Udemy web course, already have sufficient programing experience (focused on Python). I've taken quite a task upon myself for my masters thesis, developing an intelligent multi-agent system for crypto market analysis, mainly because I'm eager to learn while doing something by myself. In the end, I would like to present an extensive, quality research paper which covers this thesis. 

I guess that some of you are crypto enthusiasts and I'm just looking for ideas, hints and suggestions from experienced data scientists of everything I could include in my research paper. Currently, my thoughts are steered towards comparing different parameters or indicators and their relevance in predicting the future price of a specific cryptocoin (short term since long term seems too volatile). Not sure which parameters would be the best to even start off, so advice would be more than welcome if someone has done anything similar.

Are there any other ideas or approaches to this thesis besides price prediction? 
Any other valuable information I could obtain and analyze? 
Am I even asking the right questions? :D

Feel completely free to write anything at all as I would be more than grateful. Just want to know where to start of and focus my attention on. I'm really willing to put 150% of myself into doing this right!! 

Have a nice day. Cheers

I've recently developed an interest in data science. I'm currently working as a marketing manager at a small company, where I learned that I really love gathering, querying and visualising data. Unfortunately, this is only part of my job. Because I work at a small company I take on every part of marketing, like creating Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn posts that no one ever reads.

I strongly believe that data science - possibly applied to marketing - is a much more worthwhile career path to pursue. Therefore, I've been reading a lot about how data science can supplement my background in marketing management. Does anyone have advice for someone with my particular background to get into data science?

Furthermore, I'm a regular listener of the podcast Talk Python to Me, and learned about DataCamp last week. I've taken a few classes, but discovered that there are tons of other online courses out there. Does anyone have any experience with DataCamp or any other online courses?

Hope you can share your experiences and advice!",11,2,False,self,,,,,
