I have some experience with Python (and other languages), and am learning more, primarily motivated by the current subject.

**QUESTION:**
I would like to do the two calculations in the following multiple-variable analysis (although in reality, my dataset has a much greater number of variables).

What is a suitable kind of software/algorithm I should start researching for this kind of thing?

___

*STARTING DATASET:*

Assume I have a few hundred thousand datapoints with the following parameters:

- Person Age

- Person Weight

- Person Mental Health Score (1-5 scale)

- Person Physical Health Score (1-5 scale)

- Suicide Attempt Severity Score (1-5 scale, with 1 = didnt attempt suicide, 5 = attempted+committed suicide)

___

*CALCULATION 1:*

Lets say I specify a particular pair of values for the following parameters (one or both of these exact specified integer values may or may not exist in the original dataset):

 - Person Age = 17
 - Person Weight = 120

Given the above, I want to calculate which values of the following parameters would maximize the Suicide Attempt Severity Score.

 - Person Mental Health Score
 - Person Physical Health Score

___

*CALCULATION 2:*

For a new Person (outside the original dataset), let's say that, for the following parameters, I specify some values (again, one or all of these exact specified integer values may or may not exist in the original dataset):

 - Person Age = 15
 - Person Weight = 140
 - Person Mental Health Score = 3
 - Person Physical Health Score = 2

Given the above, I want to calculate the predicted/expected value of Suicide Attempt Severity Score for this new Person.

Advice on next steps?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7a2esd/freelance_data_scientist_for_15_years_advice_on/,empoleonpokemon202,1509526935,"I have been freelancing as a data scientist on a remote basis for about 1.5 years. I started doing some small-scale projects on Upwork for individuals, and gradually have started entering bigger contracts with start-ups and a couple of larger organisations.

The purpose of my post is two-fold:

1) to determine how I should be branding my experience from a resume standpoint

2) what sort of target market (in terms of companies) I should be pitching myself to going forward

1) As for the first point, a lot of the bigger projects that I have been doing have been under NDA. So, this has left me in the position where I can't name the client directly or give details about the project directly on my resume. At the same time, I've been publishing data science tutorials on my own website and others as well. I'm also currently in talks with a major publisher to produce a training series.

In this regard, I am trying to emphasise the achievements from a resume standpoint without giving client details away, and also discussing projects that haven't required an NDA.

As a rough example:

    DATA SCIENCE CONSULTANT AND PUBLISHER
    - Deliver extensive project solutions to range of clients, including individuals, start-ups, and larger 
    organisations. Industries have included X, Y, and Z.
    - Awarded 5-star testimonial for positive project outcome by over 70% of clients.
    - PROJECT 1
         Goal of project
         Algorithm(s) employed
         Achievement
         Achievement
    - PROJECT 2, etc...
    - Leveraged social media and SEO strategies to build dedicated data science mailing list of over 
    1,200 regular e-mail subscribers, and website of 4,000 monthly unique visitors.

The above is just one example, but is this a potential way of going about it?

2) As I mentioned, start-ups in particular have been approaching me for my services. I'm in talks with one particular client for a potential full-time remote role, and have also been getting referrals to other clients in the start-up industry. If this is becoming my niche, would it make sense to continue the path I'm currently on? i.e. continue building my client base and full-time roles may be more likely to appear that way, or should I be going the traditional route and sending out my resume to larger companies? The thing I've found is that if a client has an opportunity to see what you can do first hand, then that tends to convey much more than a resume.

To summarise, data science freelancer with 1.5 years experience doing projects mainly for individuals and (increasingly) start-ups. Would appreciate some advice as to how I should be proceeding from here in order to advance in this field.",4,5

I also need something that's 100% online due to my schedule. 

 I've been looking into data analytics. I LOVED and thrived in all my stats courses during my undergrad (took 5 of them). The more I read about this field, the more I want it. 

My question is this - should I pursue a Master's? which might of course require some additional pre-reqs due to my BA being in an unrelated field, but the world I'm coming from - higher degrees are ALWAYS required. But from what I'm reading, a BS might suffice? Buuut since I already have a bachelor's, I'm thinking maybe just going for the master's would be better? 

I'd love to hear opinions from those in the field and if you have any suggestions for 100% online schools that offer this type of degree, that'd be awesome. Bonus points if that school offers discounted tuition rates for active duty service member spouses.

But theres serious formatting problems with it preventing me from working with it. 



Problem:

The data is in matrix format. There are five questions and each question can have one of five responses which is matched with the number of students that responded a certain way. Then, there is the entire table which repeats endlessly for each class. So the data is repeated over and over again repeatedly for each time there is a different class answering the survey. 



Options: 

A. Create a summary table which counts The number of students that responded certain way to each question, thus creating one compact summary table of about five rows and five columns (5x5) 


Serious disadvantage of this is that this is not a data set. This is a summary table. 


B. Convert The tables from matrix format to entry format. As it is now, the columns do not repeat, but the rose do repeat. So each question its repeated over and over again in each table, but columns are associated to the quality of response from poor to excellent. 

We could convert the entire data set to entry format. What this means is that instead of tables independent of one another, we now have entries that are all mixed together and not tied to a specific course that the surveys were taken from. In order to do this, instead of counting the number of students that responded a certain way, we would instead record each student and their response with an ordinal number (1,2,3,4,5) where 1 would be the lowest quality (poor) and 5 would be the highest quality response (excellent). Thus, we would have a massive data set with thousands of records to be worked with. However, the questions would be the columns, the student number would be the index, and their response to each question (1-5) would be marked in the each cell. 


Example: 


Student - Question 1
1                 5
2                3

Just a little background, I already possess a M.S. in Physics (2015) and since been trying to transition into the data science/analytics industry. I have done things such as The Data Incubator bootcamp and have a decent grasp at basic concepts like machine learning. So I'm not a complete noob. 

Unfortunately, I have done interviews and always fall short of landing the job. It has mostly been due to experience in knowledge and work. But it hasn't been all bad as I am freelancing to pick up projects when I can and currently working on a contract that could potentially lead to a full-time job. 

My parents are tired of me failing in my job prospects and my father keeps insisting I go work as a physicist instead of a data scientist, despite the fact I've spent all my resources into learning more and more about machine learning and other topics in the field. As a result, they are almost forcing me to apply to graduate schools to get another M.S. (stereotypical asian family).

My question, ""Is it worth it to even apply to graduate schools now?"" If I did apply I would only apply to ones I would really want to go to vs. just to get accepted. 
i) It forces me to retake the stupid GRE (hate it and std exams with a passion) because my scores are expired. Not hard, just annoying
ii) Would I even be competitive vs. other applicants.
iii) Is it even necessary? My gut instinct says I should just focus on building my career and see where my freelancing and continuing job search takes me. 

The pros of continuing another degree would be to focus on fields I'm most interested in like NLP (i know some stuff, but it getting some expert knowledge on it would be awesome). The fact that I could be eligible for internships since I would be a student, that would finally get me that ""work experience"" in industry that so many jobs are looking for. 

I'm not looking for interview advice or anything because I am very well aware of my current weaknesses (which I am working on rectifying). 

I'm at a crossroads in my life and seeing what professionals and others think I should do. ",11,1

One I recently discovered was the magic command for reloading local Python modules when changes occur. I'm working half in PyCharm and half in a notebook, so when I'd change something to my modules in PyCharm, the changes wouldn't show up for use in the notebook.

Turns out you can use the magic command above your imports to first load the extension required, then you can define which module you'd like to autoreload:
    
    %load_ext autoreload    # load the extension
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    %aimport DataCleaningModule    # designate which module to reload each cell run
    from DataCleaningModule import text_processors as proc

If you have a .py in your module you want to reload every time (*text_processors* in my case) you just need to use *%aimport* on the module that contains your .py and Jupyter will get the changes every time you run a cell!

What are some of your tips and tricks?

I've nearly finished the Coursera John Hopkins course on data science with R. It was pretty decent, some sections were definitely better than others. I know want to move on to a python data science course. 

I have used both Python and R for data science extensively, though I have probably used R more. I've been using Python for a couple years now along with many of the data analysis libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn and their R equivalents.

I was wondering if anyone knew what the best python data science course is? I don't want a course which starts from the beginning and assumes you've never coded with Python before, but I also don't want a course which expects you to be a data science god. 

Are their any good intermediate to advanced courses in Python which go data analysis and machine learning? I am fine with paying for them. I really enjoy data science and want to hone my skills in machine learning and data analysis in Python and R. Though I've covered R for now, I really want to go really in depth with Python.

I am currently a biology undergraduate, and I will be graduating in May 2018. I have recently been introduced to programming and data via an REU this past summer, where I worked in MATLAB using a relatively large oceanographic data set over 3 years from 15 stations. I learned I really enjoy programming and working with data, so I scheduled Intro to Computer Science using Python and Biometry this semester. As time has passed, I have been considering pivoting to pursuing data science, which has been kind of bittersweet for my last year of school because 1) I had been set on pursuing marine biology since I was a kid (which led me to tunnel vision, not explore other fields, including other disciplines in marine science, etc.) and 2) I am less enthused about my biology courses (might just be senioritis, though). Thinking back, I never really felt the excitement I do when learning about computer science with any of my biology courses. I have also always been passionate about marine life and the ocean, and I do well with biology, so I just went with it. 


My degree is not math-intensive at all; the last math I took was Calculus I (4 years ago...), which isn't even required by my degree (Survey of Calculus, but Calculus I can replace it). I plan to take Linear Algebra next semester. I was planning on taking Calculus II and another CS course, but my advisor kind of screwed me. She assured me that I didn't need to take a specific biology elective, and it turns out I do, so I had to completely rearrange my schedule... 


To get to the point, I have been researching my options in order to pivot from biology to data science. I was looking at a second bachelor's in CS at a university the next city over, where there is a data science concentration. I would be able to finish this with 53 extra credit hours (~2 years). To get a CS bachelor at my current university, it requires 64 extra hours, and there are no specific data science courses. I also looked at the Georgia Tech OMSCS program, which is one reason why I am taking Linear Algebra next semester. It would be significantly cheaper (more than 50%), and from what I can tell, it seems like a lot of hiring managers look for at least a M.S. Both routes would take the same amount of time, but I don't know which would be best because I feel like I might be missing out on a significant amount of theoretical knowledge obtained with a B.S., and I am also worried because my math background is too weak (though I have always been pretty good with math and am not worried about being able to catch up if need be). 


Any insight is greatly appreciated. I have been feeling pretty lost/depressed lately, but I guess it's good that I discovered this about myself before being a year or so into a marine biology M.S.",5,2

Some say you need to be an expert in calculus and linear algegra while others say all the complex algorithms are already done for you in sklearn so you don't need that level of expertise. With sklearn, I know you need some math and statistics skills in order to understand what the algorithm is telling you, but do you really need an intense understanding of calculus and linear algegra to do data science? Some argue it is needed while others say its a scare tactic to keep people out of the field and keep demand high. 
It almost feels like saying, ""hey you need to know C++ in order to write sql because sql is written and based on c++ which is obviously not true because you don't need C++ to write sql code.  

I just want to clarify, I know you need math(pretty solid background in stats ,but not a phd level) to do data science, i'm not disputing that, but my question is do you need to know in depth linear algegra, calculus etc... in order to do data science.

Lets say you have a set of data that contains columns: education (none, highschool, associates, bachelors, graduate), work_experience (none, 1 year, 2 years, 3more years), owns_credit_card (yes, no), marital_status (single, married, divorced), children (none, 1, 2, more), buys_house (low, average, high, very_high). So assume you are creating a decision tree to determine the likelihood that someone is going to buy a house. The target would be buys_house. I am wondering logistically how you would begin and end the tree. And I dont even know if its logical to use Gini index for this set of data because I just made all those categories up but theoretically if it was already decided that this was the method we were going to use. Do you start with the node or column that has the highest Gini index (closer to 1) because it has less purity and therefore has the most options for nodes? Or do you begin the decision tree with the node that would have the lowest Gini index (closer to 0) because it is the most pure and exhaustive? And if theres no rule stating either way- Im also curious which would be the most optimized in regards to performance?

However I am a little bit at a loss of how I can transition from my experimental heavy chemistry PhD to data science. Here's why:

* All my PhD experience is in doing bench chemistry, designing methodology and running instruments. There is little data analysis done in my lab and everything is done in excel
* I only know basic Java and Python from either teaching myself or comp sci electives I took in undergrad 
* I've never taken a stats class. My knowledge of stats is very elementary and consists of only things I needed to know to understand papers (ex. p values and confidence intervals)
* I took linear algebra in undergrad but I don't remember much of it since that was about 6 years ago now. 

I recently found out about the data science fellowships (Insight, Data Incubator, etc.) which seem like they are advertised towards people with PhDs in a non-data science discipline who want to learn data science. But from reading this sub it sounds like those fellowships are only awarded to people who already have the skills and knowledge to work in data science and just need help getting a job. 

If I wanted to apply to those fellowships when I graduate, what should I do in this last year/year and a half to make myself competitive? Would I even have a chance? Should I consider doing some type of bootcamp? Would I be able to get an internship that would teach me with my limited credentials (I'm required to do an internship before I graduate). I have an opportunity to take a graduate class at my university next semester in whatever I want. What kind of class do you think would be most helpful to take?  ",6,5

As the title implies, I've got a background in stats and data science, but my ~2.5 years of professional experience thus far has been entirely software development. From the few interviews I've taken on the side, this has actually seemed to be beneficial, as a lot of data scientists with strictly data science education may not have great hands on programming skills (which are a big part of data science). Employers seem to take kindly to the breadth that comes with an education in stats/ds but with applied software expertise. My title is currently ""Data Scientist"", which at least gets me plenty of linkedin messages.

I'm at the point where I'm starting to feel like I am losing grasp on all that I learned in my stats/ds studies, and I'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas to stay relevant, stay fresh, and keep my data science skills honed. Additionally, how can I *prove* this? They're going to ask for examples of my work, and I'm going to have to say ""Welp, I spent 2.5 years writing software"". I'm scared my prospects are slipping.

Does this sound like a good path? Obviously It would be quite a steep learning curve, but I believe it should be manageable. Or would I be better trying to go back and do an undergrad math degree? my only issue is this is an extra 3 years rather than an extra year. 

I am 21 at the moment, so I have a lot of time. I'm looking at getting into the industry (rather than academia) in a few years and just want to ensure i'm following the right path to success, and am well aware I will need to up my mathematical and statistical knowledge before being valuable.

I am python (and javascript (and scheme)) developer looking for a project idea.

A few months (or years) back I started a project to help me with graphdb and conceptnet with the hope to put it to good use for doing some NLP stuff. That was a graphdb embedded in Python that is very easy to install or very easy to run. Similar to sqlite. With a Gremlin API. Anyway, after some time fiddling around text summarization, question answering, wikification (and reading about opencog). I figured out that that NLP doesn't really need my project and most of the work done in data science evolves around crunching a lot of matrix operations best done in RAM or with the help of GPUs. They are a few like opencog that do use relational model for both their KB and algorithms but I found no other examples. So there is no need for my bigger-than-RAM relational data store. I diven into the world of datascience a bit deeper I discovered that one of the weaker point of the datascience work flow was wrangling. Basically some kind of extract-transform-load (or extract-load-transform if you prefer). The tasks handled by Google dataprep. But that niche is already taken, there is even free alternatives.

I would like to help the datascience community with some working software but I don't know what to do?

By the way, would you find it useful to be able to version a graph and maintain multiple versions of it in the same manner that is done with source code with git?",4,6

* I'm an undergraduate student in Data Analytics

* Currently interning in IT Business Intelligence at a medium size company

* My goal is to become  a data scientist/machine learning scientist in the future. I hope to achieve this by progressing through industry, obviously, and perhaps with the help of a Masters in Statistics as that is my primary interest.

I have two internship offers on the table: Software Engineering @ Target, or Data Analytics @ Ford.

For someone who wants to become a data scientist, does it serve me better to take the software engineering position to diversify my skill-set and hone my competency in writing industry level code (especially since I'd have something to show for software engineering w/ a relatively short time commitment) while supporting my statistics and data processing knowledge through my coursework and current internship.

OR is it the case that if I want to become a data scientist that software engineering is only semi-related and that I simply keep going down the path of data analytics and continue to increase my experience with tools like Qlikview, Hadoop, R, Python Alteryx, etc. that an experience at Ford might afford?

I'm not sure if this sub is the best place for this question, but I'll gladly move it if not.

Anyway, I recently got laid off from my job as an analyst in a boutique consulting firm, and I'm trying to figure out what to do next.  My job involved creating market forecast models in Excel, as well as using SQL to build, query and analyze data sets from the government and insurance companies.  Because I think an ability to work with big data will only become more important in the future, I thought it might be a good career move to expand my working knowledge beyond the basic queries I learned from SQLZoo.  There are a wide variety of open courses for big data and data analytics out there, but I'm not sure which ones would be best for my situation.

I should be clear that I'm not really looking to become a full-fledged data scientist.  I have an engineering degree from a well-respected state school, and my quantitative/analytical skills are well above average.  However, they're not truly top-tier, and I don't think that I really have the mathematical chops or background to compete against math and physics Ph.D.s.  These are the types of folks who come to mind when I think of true data scientists, and the reality is that I'm not at that level.

But I do think that because of my engineering and consulting experience, I might be able to a niche for myself as some kind of data-driven consultant or in-house business strategist--someone with more hard big data skills than the average business analyst, but more on the business side than a typical data scientist.

So, do you think that the idea of ""learning big data without being a data scientist"" makes sense from a career standpoint?  And if so, are there any open courses you would recommend for someone in my position?  Any help is much appreciated. ",2,10

Hoping this isn't the wrong subreddit but please let me know if there's a better place to post this! 

I'm making a simple web app as part of a personal project. 

I've made the database in MySQL and am currently designing the front end wireframes - I'm yet to decide which tools to use to develop this. 

The overall concept is that data will be generated for the user, and they will then be able to view data visualisations based on that data. The data can change throughout the day, and will be different for each user (identified through a userID). They should be able to log onto the website and see analytics in their user area. They should also be able to download the visualisations to a PDF report. 

They should be able to see at least some charts, graphs, and in an ideal world some gimmicky infographics (but this isn't necessary). These don't need to be interactive, but it'd be cool if there was an option to do this. (Like slicers or filters in PowerBI). They should not be able to view the raw data. 


My question is: what tools might be suitable? I need something open source or at least low-cost, as it's possible but unlikely that this will become a commercial project or be profitable.


If it helps, my area of expertise is BI - relational data, MS full stack, powerBI etc. This is a new adventure for me.

* R/Python
* MS Azure Cognitive Services
* SAS Text Miner/Contextual Analysis
* Semantria/Lexalytics

Ultimately I need something that does a solid job of:

* concept extraction
* sentiment classification
* term frequency
* can process the data for further modeling and analytical treatment
* Allows for customization of n-grams within lexicons ie is NOT a black box 
* easy enough for a research analyst to self serve basic reports and high level exploration 
* flexible enough for a senior analytics specialist to 'fine tune' for maximum accuracy

Prior to nursing, I worked for several years in typical non technical 9-5 office job for a consulting firm, first as a business analyst and then a project manager. 

Im not super keen on going back for a 3rd bachelors or even a Masters or expensive boot camp as degrees od not guarantee breaking into a field.

Im also in my mid 30s (likely Ill be in my late 30s when I am ready to enter the field) so that may be a negative factor as well. 

The K2 bootcamp seems like a thorough program and not insanely expensive ($7k), but I would need to complete their prerequisite recommended course work. Im also considering doing some of the relevant computer science coursework in the OSSU (Open Source Society University) curriculum to prepare for something like K2. 

Would this preparation be enough for somebody with my non technical background to be able to land a job in data science (being in my late 30s most likely when applying)? I want to get an understanding of how realistic (or unrealistic) this is before I get started.

I am in a very unique situation with no one to turn to for advice so here I am.

Having just graduated from a top private US college with a degree in Economics, I am currently studying a masters in data science in a European university with a strong Econ and data science program. I had very little background in coding before the program started in September but I am working on strengthening them right now. The program has a strong theoretical focus but at the same time we are learning and using R, Python, SQL, Hadoop and some other data science-related software. I am a fast learner when it comes to quantitative subjects so I am doing pretty well so far. Together with the masters thesis and industrial practicum I have to complete next semester, I am confident that I will have the necessary skills to apply for and obtain junior/entry-level data scientist roles. 

The catch is that I am on a government scholarship which requires me to return to my country after one year of work overseas. This scholarship is also the reason why I am pursuing my masters in Europe instead of the US (sponsorship for a masters is only available if you pursue it on a different continent to your undergrad). This is a major issue because I need to find a job/internship by the end of February (another stipulation for being allowed to work overseas for a year). This is a huge problem because at this point in time, I don't have any work experience or possess any past projects or experience in computer science. Despite a 4.0 GPA in college, I've been told by recruiters of a few big companies I've had a referral to that I lack the requisite experience and qualifications to interview for a job in data science. Being in Europe might also be a factor as I am not a US citizen although US work permits are significantly easier to obtain  for nationals from my country compared to others. I have a friend from the same major and same year in college who is currently pursuing his masters in data science at the same college who's already had an interview with Palantir while my online application was rejected within a day because ""do not have a position which currently matches (my) background and experience at this time"".

Despite my interest in quantitative subjects in school, I'd never actually done an internship or projects related to data science or computer science. I've also never recruited because I was guaranteed a job from my scholarship. As such I'm completely clueless as to what I should do it at this point in time. One option, could possibly work out, is to stall for time so that I can apply for internships and jobs in summer next year although I would not bet on it. Assuming that that is not an option, what would be your job-seeking advice to me? What kind of company would be interested in hiring me as an intern/full-time worker?

Do you think that my lack of experience with more advanced math and statistics theories is going to be a problem later when I will apply for a job or during work? Previously I didn't have econometrics at all but we will use statistical and econometric methods during programing classes.


I have an ability to choose extra courses that focus on statistics, econometrics and math in themselves but I don't know if it is maybe better to instead take more courses that focus on practice with SAS, R, Python. It is probably not possible or very difficult to do everything due to limited time so I have to pick and choose extra subjects that will be the most beneficial for me. I will try to pick as many as I can. I think I will take at least one econometric subject for sure, to get a grip (bayesian econometrics, non linear econometric models, panel data econometrics?). Is it possible to learn enough about stats/econometrics just from practice in programming classes?


Anyway, do you think that my rather non-technical major will be a problem while applying for data science/analytics/big data jobs?
What should I focus on now, in your opinion?

I'm working on a template for a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration. This way it becomes a plug and play adventure rather than building it every time.

So far it has:

The Shape of the dataframe.

Describes the dataframe.

Types in the dataframe.

Pulls a sample.
Distoplots of variables.

Kurtosis and Skewness of variables.

Correlation Matrix.

Scatter Plots for Correlated variables.

What else would you suggest I throw in there? Once this thing is done I can link you all to it or post it or something.

Is there anything I should have to better explore categorical variables? Besides counts?

Thanks!

I know y'all probably get questions like this on this sub all the time but I've tried to get advice from lots of different people and literally all of them claim to be unable to help me :(

I'm gonna try to keep it this short as possible and I'll add more details if people ask.

I'm from the Caribbean and can't wait to get out of here and move to a big city(no opportunities here, wages are sticky, corruption).
I have a BSc in Math and Econ, 2 years work experience and I'm a CFA level 3 candidate (finance qualification). I'm really interested in Business Analytics/Data Science but not sure if to pursue a Masters in China next year or self-study through MOOCs and books and then apply to a firm in a bigger city(US/Canada/Europe/Singapore) where more opportunities exist.

My Reasoning for and against MSc in China:

**Pros:**         
                                                                                                               
Easier to learn through formal education (for me)                               
Affordable!                                                      
I will be a awarded a Degree from the University of Liverpool (Somewhat Recognizable)                                                  
Opportunity to learn Mandarin and Chinese culture

**Cons (big cons IMO):**                                               
     
Out of the workforce for 1 and 1/2 yrs (No work experience, mentor or salary)                                        
Not an Ivy League School

Alternatively, I would consider putting linux on the thing, but it seems like a mistake to mess around too much with a $600 iPad, and my brother might get mad (the one who gave it to me).

I am a recent college graduate, and I studied Applied Mathematics in uni. Last year, I took two courses that changed my mind about hating Math/STEM as a whole. Data Mining and Time Series Analysis. I really enjoyed both, and got A's on both exams and did every single homework perfectly. I found myself enjoying working with data, and found it rewarding to understand the complex relationships between data and then analyzing them. I've always enjoyed knowing more about Finance and Economics, and mixing these two... I think I have found a future career for myself: Becoming a Data Engineer/Scientist/Analyst. The trouble is, I don't know what they do exactly. They are just words to me, because even reading around the web, it's like someone is just ""defining"" them. I also don't know any data scientists irl, so... I would like to hear from experts if the path I'm about to take is the correct one: 

I'm applying to graduate schools (free of charge), and there is no program offered titled ""Data whatever...""  (in my country) But, there's a subsection of an Industrial Engineering program, called ""Management Engineering"" and the course syllabus mentions Time Series Analysis and Data Analysis as two of the courses that must be taken. (Other courses are Marketing, a lot of Economics, Decision, Quality, system Eng,... )I think this is the best path for me. I do not want to study Math/CS or Statistics, because I do want a bit of a Business flair to things. My internships have proven to me that a knowledge of how things work in the real world is much better in the long run than being able to understand how things word on the lowest levels. 


I am going to graduate school, because I plan on applying for PhD positions later on, so this step is necessary. I just need to know if anyone knows anything about Engineering Management and its connection to work(of any kind, even research) in the field of Data.

I've been applying for DS/Analytics type roles for a few months now, which has been a bit of a harrowing experience. Atop the usual anxieties of underprepared-ness, I've been faced with some frustrating behavior of ghost recruiters and am curious if perhaps I'm on a blacklist. At least 5 times now, I've had a recruiter reach out and contact me, only to never again respond. I understand people are busy, forgetful, perhaps they find a more qualified candidate in the ~hour it may have taken me to respond. This seems to only happen to me with actual recruiting agencies, and never when going through internal recruiters. 

But even further, just this past week, I've had two recruiters schedule phone interviews with me to again only vanish without a word. Neither of them responding to my inquiry or attempt to reschedule. Is this indicative of someone on a blacklist? To me, it's strange if so, as I don't believe I've warranted it, and also would assume someone would check a name against a blacklist before an initial contact. To make matters (more?) confusing, one of the jobs I've just been ghosted on was just reposted to Indeed. Would applying again be a bad move?

I am not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit, but it's worth a shot.

I am a senior at a 4 year university. I have a major in psychology with a minor in statistics. I have a 4.0 GPA. In my coursework I am learning R, SAS, and SPSS. I am also working on a project that involves a massive data set to see if students that engage in mindfulness behaviors have higher GPA through mediation of several other variables. Emotionally, I want to be a clinical psychologist. However, that requires a Ph.D. in clinical psychology. For those who don't know, clinical psychology is an insanely hard field to get into. I am starting to question if the time and energy is worth it. Statistics and data science has really grown on me since starting my minor.  Plus data analysts seem to make a lot more money (I know that should not be a huge factor, but it is a factor none the less).  I have been entertaining the idea of going into data analytics.  I am actually taking a graduate level statistics course right now; the professor and I were chatting and she told me to send her my resume, her husband works at Capitol One and she said, he will see if he can potentially help me landing an internship.  However, I don't think a psychology background is going to look good to most employers.  During my last semester, I am thinking about taking other 500-600 level statistics courses to demonstrate my capabilities.

I've published a kernel on Kaggle about a week ago and I've constatly added new content on it, with links and explanation, so that beginners can learn a lot of informations while reading about data science related stuff (since the dataset in the answers to a survey that was conducted by kaggle).

In this link you'll find : 
A demographic analysis of the respondents
A statistical approach to dimensionality reduction and 2D plotting for categorical variable (MCA)
A predictive model that predicts whether a US data scientist has an income than 130k or not.

Here's a link to the kernel https://www.kaggle.com/mhajabri/what-do-kagglers-say-about-data-science/

I really hope you enjoy it guys and hopefully you can learn a thing or two for the future from it.

I will be taking part in a 3-4 month data bootcamp in 2 weeks. I have a basic knowledge of Python programming (finished 6.00.1 &amp; 2), and fairly strong at math (was an engineering major in college).

In these 2 weeks, should I:
1) Brush up on my statistics, probability, and linear algebra, or
2) Read up on machine learning

I'm leaning toward option 1 since I believe once I start the bootcamp, I will be 100% focused on the machine learning stuff, but for now it would be best if I build some sort of foundation first so that I can absorb the machine learning material better during the bootcamp.

I'd love to know what your thoughts and opinions are about this. Thank you :)",6,10

So I started job hunting, and got a job doing entry level data stuff (data entry, a bit of reporting, etc). I have past IT experience, and have been learning Python and R from Coursera. It's been tough, but I've been doing well. Also, I'm going to be doing a post-grad certificate course in DS fundamentals, starting Jan, to gain knowledge into SQL, ML, etc.  
I'm looking into Business Analyst job offers to begin, and then dive into more opportunities that are DS related. I'd really like to do a Masters in Data Science but I know I may have to start later than most people. 
I guess what I'm asking is, is it possible for someone that hasn't studied CompSci or graduated with that kind of degree for undergrad, to make it in the DS world? Is it possible to gain the knowledge from online and certificate courses and still be able to do well in this field?

Assuming I want to do math or statistics vs data science,  would it be better to do a MS in statistics or a MS in applied math?  I like applied math more purely for the interest of it,  but I think statistics is more relevant and more practical if I want to go the data science route.  Is that correct?  Applied math seems a bit broad too broad and it doesnt focus my expertise as much.  Plus,  will hiring managers appreciate a masters in statistics or a masters in math?

I'm working on a project to analyse the speeches of MPs in the UK parliament and I would like to be able to identify whether an MP is positive or negative about a particular topic/policy and whether two MPs are in agreement or disagreement based on their speeches. Has anyone worked on something similar before?

Here's an idea I have about how to do it but I'm not quite sure if it will work or not yet so I would appreciate some pointers/suggestions!

0. Use voting data to identify which pairs of MPs agree and disagree with each other on a particular topic most of the time.
0. Take speeches that they gave and pair them up, assigning labels based on whether they voted the same or differently.
1. Take a subset of this and correct it by hand. This becomes my validation set.
1. Use a [siamese BLSTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWjIoRNTCdU) with glove vectors trained on parliamentary speeches (?) to train a language model that predicts (dis)agreement. I can't just use simpler setups such sentiment analysis because obviously there are a lot of subtle differences in speech. Eg. ""We should develop renewable energy to the fullest extent"" and ""Coal is a terrible energy source"". The first sentence would have positive sentiment, whereas the second has negative sentiment, yet both are ""in agreement"" about environmental policy.

2. This is where I'm stuck. How would I do this for my whole corpus of speeches? Should I create a massive matrix of speech pairs for every topic and MP and use that to create a similarity matrix? Since this is politics, there is no baseline truth. All intentions are relative to other MPs...


If you have any alternative suggestions, I would love to hear them!

day 2: find top 20 performing stocks, store their info, and also add info about previous days stocks performance today

day 3: find top 20 performing stocks, store info, and also add info about previous 2 days stocks performance today

Having already a suitable standard model cox model, I'm wondering if clustered standard issues could be an serious ""threat"".

In usual regression, clustered standard errors are the usual way to go. Specifically, in my case, due to the panel structure the i.i.d assumption does not hold. As far as I understood, the standard errors which is provided by the coxph() regression in R only delivers homoscedactic standard errors.

Did I get this right so far? If yes, is there any possibility to get heteroscedastic (""Sandwich"") Standard Errors. I read that the cluster() option might be an option, but I'm not sure if actually adresses heteroscedacity.

Note that I'm not talking about unobserved heteroscedacity, I'm concerned with the heteroscedacity of the standard errors.

I'm an experienced Python/C++/Java (+20 years) developer working for a financial data company. We have data sets that hold information for a whole range of securities (Equities, Fixed Income, FX, OTCs etc etc) . These include

* Pricing
* Ratings
* Indexes
* Instruments/Legal Entities

and much much more.

We also have a view on exceptions that happen on each of these data points which could be from over 40 vendor suppliers of financial data (Thomson Reutres, Markit, SIX, Bloomberg, IDC, JPMorgan, Barclays etc).

Over the past 6 months I've been using Jupyter, Tensor Flow, Spark ML etc for some of my own projects. The trouble is I don't know where to start using ML to make sense or add intelligence around the HUGE (terabyte+ volume) of financial data I have to hand.

Any ideas or pointers? I feel like I'm at the cusp where the ""penny will drop"" and I can see a way through all of this but need a bit of a steer.

Apologies for the broad nature of the question but that's where I am with this at present.

Im currently making a leap into Data Science and am glad to have found this forum!  Already read a bunch of great info by scrolling through the front page!

Been working at it full time for 2-3 months so far (early days) and have got to grips with the theory and math of statistical methods up to and including multiple regression modelling/basic forecasting models.  Ive got a strong grasp of R, which is growing intuitively and Ive got to grips with SQL well enough to implement, query and manage a database using the language alone, again growing intuitively.

Im coming into Data Science from a Music Analysis background and so Im finding applying music theory concepts to databases and R language is really abstract and very enjoyable  its teaching me a lot about using the tools of the field in a very creative way!

So..
Hi all!  I look forward to joining the discussion!

298,2017-11-15,2017,11,15,3,7cxtp7,I've developed two libsvm utilities,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7cxtp7/ive_developed_two_libsvm_utilities/,1Wittgenstein1,1510685733,"So my question is whether this is a personal hack job or worth throwing up on github. If some people are interested, let me know.

I am a fairly average programmer. I have developed two utilities. One is in java. It can compile data dynamically and print it out either as libsvm or as csv. When it prints out as libsvm, it also prints out the feature names and label category names as well. It can also merge libsvm or csv files, it can save file parts and recompile later (if facing memory issues) and edit column values using regex.

The second is a scala/spark utility that wraps around an RDD[LabeledPoint]. This utility allows me to keep label and column names with the libsvm data so I can use them when printing out charts and results. It also lets me remove columns, calculate aggregate values for columns, reduce rows to the label by aggregate operations etc. And, it ties into the java utility (mentioned above)

I have run all of these functions on a dataset of 700000 rows and 3000 columns on my laptop with 8gb of RAM. It seems pretty fast.

So, are there utilities out there already that do this kind of thing, or is it worth refactoring this and sharing?",1,1

I want to be able to both predict whether a sales opportunity will be closed-won (or closed-lost) and better predict the close date of the opportunity. Thus, I'm doing binary classification and regression (# of days since opportunity was created).

I've found features like the opportunity's current stage, # of days until expected close, and # of times the opp has changed in certain ways to be predictive.

However, I'm revisiting how I split the data into training and testing datasets. I know that if I randomly partition the opps then I can't trust my model evaluations on the test set; I want the testing dataset to mirror the realities of using these models in production. 

Instead, I've tried the following though I think this is biased in that my testing dataset ends up with opps with a shorter lifecycle:

Building up my training features dataset by filtering to opps that closed before a certain date, say `training_close_max &lt;- as.Date('2017-07-10')` and filtering my testing features dataset to opps that closed after the `training_close_max`, but before another date like `testing_close_max &lt;- as.Date('2017-10-30')`. The training and testing dataset predictors are similar except when it comes to # of days since created, where the testing dataset is shorter. To compound on top of this, the nature of the sales opportunities tend to change over time; I'd like to ideally train my models on the most recent sales opportunities that are most similar to our current open opps.",1,2

In terms of learning, should I focus on writing my own NN's ala Andrew Ng's courses (original or new DL) or do people use scikit learn options? Again if you had time to start over what would be best. I'm playing the long game here of trying to build up to LSTM type networks.

The obvious and general response here would be to search desired job listings, and brush-up/learn the skills required accordingly. Though this isn't always so easy, and the variance of skills/knowledge can be high (excluding the very obvious ones). There is also the issue of domain knowledge, of which one may not have any at all, let alone specific to the job applied to. Picking up on this can seem tough from the outside, especially to be up to date on current practices.

Perhaps someone can suggest some useful books/blogs/etc which would help those of us coming from a purely stats/analysis type of background to get used to certain domain spaces and the techniques there. Industries like Finance/Econ, Bio/Medical, Ad/Marketing, etc., seem to use familiar methods, but sometimes have rather unfamiliar nomenclature for them.

A bit about my background (if anyone would have some direct suggestions for me I'd be very appreciative): Masters in Stats, Bachelors in Math, have had some basic analytics work using google analytics, a short (1 semester) internship for a pharma company as a statistical consultant, quite good with R, intermediate with Python/SQL/SAS, familiar with most modern learning techniques.  I've tried to keep sharp by reading stats/ML books, learning/refreshing topics on youtube, testing out some tools in Kaggle comps. Despite this, I'm still quite nervous come every interview (there haven't been many).

When Thursday rolls around, the event does not end up happening. How is the model retrained in order to make a prediction about Friday? Does it simply retrain itself from scratch, this time using an extra day's worth of data (Thursday's data)?

I did a quick search for ""geology"" and ""spatial"" but couldn't find this being discussed. My background in Data Science is mainly from financial crime - so moving into geology based problems is proving to be a challenge (a good one)

If you have many layers of information for a given area, say 100 square miles - you can create many data points by outputting an observation for every 250m or so in a grid fashion (likely using arcGIS or similar). 

My question relates to this: how to split this data into a train/test set? If you do it randomly it's likely that two points next to each other are virtually the same apart from minute differences so train data will leak into test - but if you split by area, it's likely that certain features will never get seen (what if that forest is entirely in the test set, for example).

I guess you could split the area up into larger chunks and randomly sample these (So on the whole, points next to each other stay in train or test and do not leak).

As far as personal projects, the only thing I've done is written a paper about choosing strategies using game theory (Blotto games) and a Monte Carlo algorithm to find the optimal distribution for winning at fantasy basketball and then finding the predicted player value for NBA players using excel. I like the idea of prediction through statistics and data, but I don't have really the technical skills right now.

Do I still have time (over the next year or so) to learn enough to be employable in this field? I don't think I really have the grades/extra curriculars to go to grad school. 

Do you have any resources you'd recommend? I have a few books on sci-kit and tensor flow I'm trying to get through.

Or is it a better idea for me to give up and just try to find more typical business jobs like sales or financial advising or an analysts or something?",9,2

One big issue I have is the following. Suppose I want to use a clustering algorithm from scikit-learn on my dataset--for the sake of argument, we will use the k-means clustering algorithm (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) on the Kaggle dataset Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

Suppose my dataset has more than three attributes, so that I can't plot the clusters in three-dimensional Euclidean space. How do I evaluate the effectiveness of my clustering algorithm? (EDIT: for the sake of simplicity, all my attributes are assumed to be continuous, not categorical variables).

My understanding is that in R there are ways to quickly produce the 2D projections of the clusters. This can be misleading (since the low-dimensional projections of well-separated clusters in higher-dimensional Euclidean space can overlap) but it's at least something one can look at. Is there a similar functionality in scikit-learn?

There are also various metrics like the Dunn index which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of clustering algorithms, but AFAICT, this can get pretty hairy and leads one into active research fields in computer science.

What I want to know is, what does the working data scientist do in this situation to get a good feeling for how well the clustering algorithm is working?",9,13

Each user (aka member) can invite a friend to become a user with his/her personal promo code.
When the friend become a user ( and provides the promo code during the on-boarding process) the system will grant 5 each.

Each user can get up to 100 via this process.

One year of data available.

**Business Question**

* Estimate the weekly growth of the number of users considering both new organic members and new members via the Member get Member process.
* Estimate the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for each user and the average.
* Allow a scenario simulation by changing some of the model parameters ( bonus amount, bonus maximum amount, average number of members invited, average number of inviters,  )

**Proposed Solution**

    Start in t=t0 with n=n0 current users.

    Get the state at t=t1 applying the following for each of the n(t-1) users:

      * 1)Each user dies with probability p(die|t=time_since_alive);
            p is taken by the historical distribution.

      * 2)If the user dont die it has probability p(invite|t=time_since_alive) to invite other members;
            p is taken by the historical distribution.

      * 3)Update bonus for each user.

      * 4)Add new organic users and repeat point 1 to 3.

The way I sort of think about it is that if a particular partition of the data has different behaviour to another then the trees will just split on that characteristic and then build their own sub models from there. If I partition the sample then train models on the partitions then I can think of it as a larger tree where I've forced the first split on the model.

One hypotheses I have is that if there's one feature where I expect the generating process to be wholly different dependent on the feature then maybe it's worth building different models. For instance if I have the same types of customer demographic info for an electronics store and a real estate company and want to predict likelihood to buy electronics or real estate I should probably build a separate model for the real estate company and the electronics store.",1,14

I work full time as a web developer at an advertising agency, and have been programming professionally for 4 years.  I've always been mathematically inclined, and I'm comfortable learning things from textbooks.

I'd like to transition to a data science role, and I'd like to know the best way to approach that.

The biggest catch is that I didn't complete my undergraduate degree, which I expect will be an obstacle in getting positions in the future.

So as I see it...

**Pros**

- 4 years of programming experience
- Experience with data visualization libraries in Javascript
- Experience with functional programming styles in Javascript
- Some on and off tinkering in R over 2 years
- Comfortable reading scientific studies
- Comfortable reading technical docs

**Cons**

- Incomplete university degree in unrelated field (Commerce)
- No scientific credibility


**What to learn?**

I read through a university of toronto, 'interested in data science' page, which detailed a number of important courses to take for statistics majors interested in data science.  Listed were...

**Required**

- Methods of Data Analysis I and II (STA302H1, STA303H1), 
- Design of Scientific Studies (STA305H1), 
- Theory of Statistical Practice (STA355H1), and 
- Statistical Methods for Data Mining and Machine Learning (STA414H1).  

**Recommended**

- Statistical Computation (STA410H1)
- Statistical Methods (STA437H1 and STA442H1)
- Theory and Methods for Complex Spatial Data (STA465H1) 
- Fundamentals of Statistical Genetics (STA480H1)

**The Big Idea**

If I pickup the textbooks for those 8 courses, and work through them, completing any exercises therein, then that would likely take about 500-800 hours of effort.

If on top of that, I get more serious with my study of R, and slowly work through Hadley's Advanced R, and perhaps a similar book on Python, that might add another 120 hours.

But even after extensively learning the material in the stats textbooks, and honing my programming in R and Python, I'll still have the problem of credibility.

**Credibility**

What does credibility look like to those hiring for data science positions?

Are there indicators of credibility aside from the Undergraduate/Masters/PhD that I could leverage to get a position? 

- A history of success in leading teams on Web development projects?
- A 12 week bootcamp?
- Project examples on Github?  
- A blog with 15-20 in-depth case studies?

If I want to spend 1000 hours over the next 3 years making this transition happen, what things should I change about this approach, and is this a realistic time frame and estimation of effort?

**What Alternative Approaches Should I Consider?**

Are there any data-science adjacent positions that are more programming heavy?  If I was extremely proficient in R or Python, but didn't have a super deep statistics background (Hypothetically, let's say I read and understand ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" but don't go further), are there data-science type positions that would allow me to play an important role on a team?",10,16

I have a BS in Mathematics, but I've been out of school for 5 years, so I've been brushing up on subjects related to data science in hopes of making a transition to the field. I am currently going through a review of multivariable calculus and was wondering if I need to continue through to line/double/triple integrals or if just finishing a review of the derivative and optimization sections is enough.

The relationship between what I've been learning about DS and the derivative sections of multivariable calculus was pretty easy to see and I started my review, but I haven't pieced together or seen someone lay out how the integration section might be related.

I do reporting using SQL, C#, VBA, SSRS, Qlik Sense and other similar applications.  I've also used SSAS a while ago to build cubes and I familiar with SSIS.  

My company has recently purchased Alteryx and it looks to be pretty amazing. My new mission is to use Alteryx to answer questions like, ""if a certain group hasn't gotten a raise in a while, what are the chances they will turnover?"" or ""is there a correlation between people taking courses and going into management?"". I'm sure there a many more to come. 

The problem is I don't know statistics beyond doing an average. Going through Alteryx is pretty overwhelming as far as the prediction/analysis part of it.  I find it fascinating and would really love to learn it, but I don't know where to begin.

There is some training I've found online, with Alteryx, and a bunch Youtube videos. But it seems to me that I could learn to use the software, but if I don't have an understanding of what it is really doing, I won't be able to make the proper use of it. Sort of like learning music software, but not being able to read music.

I did start a Lynda course on basic Statistics but I still feel that I am very far away from understanding this stuff. Despite my job (and Masters in C.S.) I am not a ""math person."" I'm not sure if that matters or not.

Can you please recommend some online (or other) training that would be useful? 

Do you think unless I go back to school to get a degree in data science, am I going to be hopelessly lost?

Thank you for the help!

edit: I just realized that some others have asked a very similar question (within a few hours ago!). I think mine is a little different by the fact I am already employed and have over 15 years experience (not with data science, obviously) and this is a shift that my department is trying to make.",4,6

TOPIC: Researching the various factors that affect auto insurance premium rates, and figuring out on average how much minors (drivers below the age of 20) pay vs. adults (drivers 20 and over) pay. 

Regression model: Y(Auto Insurance Rates) = 0 + 1(annual mileage) + 2(number of previous accidents) + 3(pop. density of area of residence) + 4(age) + 5(credit score) + 6(vehicle safety rating) + 7(vehicle age) + 8(marital status -&gt; if yes = 1,  if no = 0) + 9(gender) + 10(vehicle size) + Error term 

After quick research, I expect the first 3 independent variables to have a positive effect on predicted Y, the next 5 variables to have a negative effect, and the last 2 to have an uncertain effect. 

There's a lot of specific information to gather here and I have no clue where to go from here. Am I supposed to call up a big auto insurance firm and ask for their data? I am looking for at least 100 (hell, 1000 would be even better probably) observations/individuals that have all of this information, if there is some data missing I'm sure I can take care of that with R or Python.

I'm a mechanical engineering graduate.  I have recently convinced my job that it would be beneficial for me to go back to uni for a masters to help with more advanced projects.  I want to work in Data Science/Machine learning, and I've found some degrees on the subjects, but a friend who is a CS masters holder informed me that it would probably be best to get a computer science masters and then to focus the elective courses on Machine learning/data science.  That way I get a good grounding in all of CS and still get some Data science courses.  

The courses in data science tend to be modules focusing solely on one type of learning/analysis at a time.  For example, Applied Bayesian Methods, Advanced Topics in Machine Learning, Machine Vision ect.  I have seen information on all of this online and figure that for the focused items I could find that information readily available online and be able to study up on that independently.  

What do you all think of this?  Is it better to go for a fully rounded computer science masters (since Im coming from Mechanical Engineering) and focus on the data science parts independently, or to go right in for a masters in data science?

Thank you all for any assistance!

Will this degree suffice and how will I compare to other job seekers?
What can I do to make myself more marketable?
Should i be looking for an entry level position? If so, what type of companies should i be looking at?
Im also looking for some advice and guidance along the way as i enter a new field with what i should be doing to get to where i want to be.

At this point I consider myself just past the stage of ignorance; I know what I don't know and I've started plotting out the resources I will need to know it.  I've read just about every reddit guide and website curriculum (like elitedatascience etc) but now I am looking to solidify a plan that best suits my needs.


What I need help with is:

(1) prioritizing the order of my studies and 

(2) maximizing the efficiency of the time I spend studying.  

I am not looking for a ""6 months to data science track"" for obvious reasons, but I also can't take on 10 super-thorough-6-month-long MOOC's that overlap in what they teach or I'll never hit my goals.  So basically, **what should I focus on first, what should I save for later, and what subjects are good to learn in tandem?**


**Some background about myself:**

-  BS in Finance and Information Systems (double major)
-  MBA w/ concentration Finance
-  7 years experience as a Businesss Analyst/Product Developer/Project Manager, primarily in FinTech 
-  Currently working for a small startup with a team of data scientists.  Job responsibilies include finding/cleaning/storing their data, running and QAing their models, and working with development teams to automate these tasks.
	-  I have expressed intrest in learning more about data science and they have encouraged me down this path.

**My skillset and self ratings:**

-  Translating business requirements (5/5)

-  SQL (4/5)

-  Python (2/5)

-  Statistics (2/5)(Would say 3, but I realize I'm talking to real statisticians here)

-  Data gathering/cleaning/elementary data analysis (2/5)(would say 4/5 by manually using SQL and Excel, but I am trying to take this to the next level; ie automation, prediction, and re-usable tools)

**Steps I've taken (a bit scattered):**

-  Learning Python (on and off the past year, much more focused the past several months)

	-  Resources : Automate the Boring Stuff, Absolute Beginner's Guideto Python, checkIO for practice, some on the job practice, and pet projects (NFL stats or whatever RPG I'm playing)

	-  Focusing not only on getting things done, but on how to get things done in a pythonic fashion.

-  Data Science from Scratch as a syllabus.  

	-  Using this to get from 0 to 1.  Great handbook for basics.

-  Started the first few chapters (or lessons) of: 

    -  Think Stats - not sure I like the format and all the extra work you have to do to even use the book

	-  Linear Algebra videos/lessons - I've got the absolute [basics down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab), but I'm sure I need more

	-  Introduction to Statistical Learning - Realized I needed some more math refreshers first.  Also self conscious about jumping into R without a firm enough grasp on python

	-  Machine Learning class by Andrew Ng - Got through week 3 but feel like I need to refresh my maths first or I'll be getting too ahead of myself.
		
**Next Steps I'm mulling over:**

-  Full computer science intro?

	-  I'm getting a good handle on Python but am not sure if I should complete something like CS50 or if that is overkill.

-  Take a full Statistics course or a refresher?

	-  I know down the road I will need more and more advanced stats, for now I need to focus on what I'll need to get started.

	-  I know regression, multiple regression, ANOVA tables, and some more from quantitative finance classes.  But could stand to refresh these topics.

	-  I don't know Bayes and am not sure when the best time to learn this will be.

	-  The [Duke class](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) is supposed to be great, but I am not sure if I need a 6 month long Statistics program.

-  Full Linear Algebra course or stick with the basics until I need more?

	-  Have heard both points argued, not sure which I should pursue.

	-  Course options are [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) or [Harvard](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)

-  Single and Multivariate Calculus

	-  Need a refresher for single (haven't looked at it in 10 years) I hear Khan Academy is good, I also just dug up my old textbook.

	-  Never learned multivariate

		-  How important is this?  Should I take a full class or focus on the basics for now?  Again, I've heard Khan Academy is good.

-  Machine Learning 

	-  [Introduction to statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) or [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) class or both?

		-  Both are highly touted and from what I've seen in both's introductors classes they are very well tought.  

-  [Harvard's CS109 Data Science Class](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)

	-  Are classes like this too general or would this be a good course to take?
		
**Down the Road for later (I know I'm not there yet):**

-  More and more stats

-  Essentials of Statistical Learning (I can only hear it refered to as the bible so many times)

-  Neural Networks

-  AI

-  Big Data (Hadoop/Spark)

-  Natural Language Processing

**Conclusion:**  

I have done a lot of research on what I will need to know and have started or tried out a bunch of material.  I've weened out plenty sources of I need help focusing my effort

I am three weeks out from graduating with my masters in data analytics and have been applying for a few positions around the country including my home town. 

I'm currently working as a Financial Analyst using mostly excel and some trading platforms so I've been looking for a role that utilized some of the skills we developed in the program such as SAS, R, Python, SQL, and Tableau. 

My current role pays ~$62K plus the benefits of a Fortune 100 company. Other perks include an on-site gym and a size-able bonus, I should expect $7K at minimum this year. We have your typical 5.5% 401K match as well $500 credit towards an HSA if you contribute to one.  

I currently have a contract position available to me that is exactly what I am looking for. Title would be ""Data/Business Solutions Analyst"". The position is a 1 year+ contract with potential for extension and/or conversion. Compensation is $40/ hour or $80K annually with a 2 week vacation. No PTO and 401K match doesn't kick in until after a year. 

I'm hesitant to get into a contract position because I know I could find a full-time job somewhere if I explored more options. From what I understand the conversion rate is relatively high so I doubt I would be a contract employee for the entire year. 

Now, if I back out all of the benefits I have in my current role from the contract position the math looks something likes this: 

Type | $$ |
:--|:--|
Offered Salary:|$80,000|
Bonus:|$7,000|
401K Match:|$3,421|
HSA Contribution:|$500|
Gym:|$500|
Left Over:|$68,579|
Current Salary:|$62,220|
Pay ""Increase"":|$6,379|


The only thing I am missing is the difference in the cost of medical insurance I am paying now and what it would cost from the contract company but that wouldn't total up to $6K right? 

Any other advice or input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you! ",23,3

2. What programs are available to allow me to visualize these large datasets if I can pick up the language? I may need to request something through work.

To give some context, I have a Master's in social sciences, focussing in the end of my study on statistics and R. I have since then been working as a data/web analyst, honing my python and some ML knowledge on the side. I like being a data analyst but it's too far away from what I originally studied. I like programming and I like research/modelling etc. I therefore would really like to make the jump to data science.

The only problem that I'm faced with, is that most of the material out there is very superficial on theory. It seems that all the courses I can find spend a lot of time explaining standard statistics (e.g. regression) and in showing how to code certain models. I know my statistics and I know my programming, but if anyone would ask: 'why are you using this model instead of this one' or 'could you explain to me exactly what a random forest does' I would be really lost.

I am a game developer who has recently taken up the role of data analyst in my company. However, as I am still learning on the topic, there are a lot of things that I still don't know about.

Currently I have a question regarding finding correlation.

I have a time series of sales data for our game, recorded in weeks. During each of these weeks we hosted a event in the game with a top reward. This reward has different traits and properties, such as being a resource/unit/building/belongs to a faction etc...

What I want to find out is, are there any correlation between the traits and properties of the reward and the rise/drop in sales. i.e. Does a certain type of reward makes more people want to spend money during the event.

Is that possible to test for? Most time series resources I found online talks about forecasting, but there ain't anything that talks about testing for dependency with another variable.

An idea that I have is to diff the time series of sales to get a stationary series, and then perform a chi-squared test to see if a certain trait/property causes more rises/drops than the expected value. But I am not sure if that is even the correct way to do it.

Please let me know if I have any misconceptions about the analysis. Thank you for reading through the post!",12,7

Ive been dreaming of a career in politics, intelligence work, or diplomacy for almost as long as I can remember. Im a first year in college, studying as a dual major of Political Science and International Studies, and Ive only just stumbled on my unis data science program. Ive spent the last several hours binge-scrolling through this amazing subreddit and have completely fallen in love with this whole field! 

My question to you fine folks is this: as someone who is still tremendously interested in politics, intel, and diplomacy, but as a pragmatist who both loves the idea of specializing in data science and the idea of having a fallback, which major should I drop? IE: go for a double PoliSci BS/Data Science BS or an International Affairs BA/Data Science BS?

Im looking through my schools catalog as Im writing this, and either would be completely doable at this stage (first year, plenty of flexibility). In your experience, which would be more hireable, more practical, more in-demand? (And of course, no snap decisions for me. Ill be sure to think this over for a while)

I am somewhat new to the world of data science, but I do feel that I have made a good start. I am doing good with Python since I started it a couple of months ago and I realistically feel that my future lies in data science. I have a good educational background in statistics and I own a Masters degree too, with plenty of experience around business and social research.

However, until just a few months ago, my primary career line was freelance writing. But to be honest, I have confidently felt over the past year that it's not a career line with a very promising outlook. I am currently handling a few major online translation projects and it will be able to let me survive for a couple of months. So now I am thinking about fast tracking my data science learning process and completing a few good online courses. But, I do fear that sooner or later, I will go back to the really frustrating pursuit of finding average to low pay writing gigs as the bills begin to pile up.

But I have been exploring the idea of finding entry level freelance gigs that a data science enthusiast like me can start off with. I would rather prefer working in low-to-average pay entry level data science jobs now, than move back to freelance writing. I think I could do even better by working with an experienced data scientist, like maybe become some sort of an online apprentice. As of now, the scope for data science around my country is fairly low and only a few businesses are actually aware about it. The future maybe different, but I don't see many promising office desk jobs coming over here in that sector anytime soon.

**So, I was just wondering if folks at r/datascience could let me know about sites on the web, where I could find the most basic online entry level data science jobs and move forward in the sector. I am fairly good at graphics designing (including infographics), video making and audio creation, in addition to my 4 year long experience in writing: can I also market those skills to any professional data scientist? (if yes: let me know the places to go)**

Data is the closest thing we have to a real world application of truth, and the world is a better place when decisions are made with care. 

Now that you know why you should become a data scientist, here is a simple guide to becoming one. 

**Prerequisites:**

**Math**: You can honestly get really far with little math. That being said, there are far too many people who don't understand the math and end up using analysis techniques with little forethought into why they should be using that model. I will say this much: The more math, the better off you are. It is a beautiful field and directly relevant to you if you want to make the most of your foray into data science. 

Beginner: High school algebra, maybe some calculus 1, high school statistics

Intermediate: College stats, Calc 1,2,3, Probability Theory, linear algebra, Statistical Inference

Advanced: Upper undergrad / Grad level statistical inference, bayesian inference, harder probability theory, linear optimization, convex optimization, real analysis, calculus of variations. Math is the limiting factor, remove those obstacles. Learn all the advanced math you can muster.

Reccs: khanacademy if you've never seen the content. MIT OCW has really great self paced math courses for calc 1-3, linear algebra and much more. Eventually you will want to learn the art of grinding through math textbooks while doing problems. **The only way to learn math is by doing math. Practice, practice, practice.**

If you want to be a true OG, here is Michael I. Jordan's reading list for prospective grad students in ML: 

[Mike I. Jordan ML Books](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1055389)

**Programming**

Pick up a language and stick with it for now. It is far easier to pick up a second language once you are very good at one than it is to slowly work through being mediocre at a bunch of languages. 

People live and die by their language of choice for some reason. Generally, my thoughts on this are the following:

R is fantastic. R is great for data analysis, and if you use the tidyverse, R is great for everything else too. R is an **organically grown** language that is not always lexically consistent, so it can be a bit quirky. Due to the community of statistics researchers that use R, generally you will find the most bleeding edge packages on R. R will make you think like a statistician.

Python is great for taking your data a bit farther. It has packages which provide most of the functionality you would need from R. Python is a great choice because it has many more varied packages and capabilities related to software development. Python is a broad, general purpose language that is beautifully **designed** and consistent. This will make you think more like a programmer.

Over a career, it is wise to know as many tools well as you can. Since you will spend a good amount of time writing code, you should strive to learn both at some point. 

Alrighty, now onto the core stuff. 

**How to:**

**1. Get Data**

This can be done by scraping, downloading a data set, building a data set, making a survey, whatever. There is a lot of data floating around and there are plenty of resources for learning how to scrape. Since data is usually stored in data bases in the real world, it is wise to learn a bit about data bases. Learn some SQL. Since we live in the age of big data, it would also be wise to learn non-relational database query languages like nosql and postgresql

Some good spots for data: /r/datasets, kaggle, data.gov

**2. Clean it**

Remember: garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the data is the foundation of all your work from here on out. Check out a book or a course that will take you from these early stages into actually playing with the data. For python, [Harvard CS109](https://github.com/cs109/content) does this. It also have video lectures. For R, Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at RStudio) has a bunch of amazing books out. Check out [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511408512&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=r+for+data+science) . It wouldn't hurt to eventually read a book on data cleaning and data interpolation.

**3. Take some time to familiarize yourself with your data**

What kind of variables are there? Quantitative (numbers)? Categorical / Qualitative (Labels)? Text? Images?
 Geographical? The types of data present will determine what can be modeled. 

Its a good idea to look at the data in list form and plot it out using R or python or excel or whatever. If using other types of data (eg images, geographical), then find the best ways to visualize the data. Now would be a good time to learn about knitr and rmarkdown if using R and jupyter notebooks if using python. 

This is the time to do some *descriptive statistics.* Look at the way the data flows on the plots. What relationships do you think are there? Are there any outliers? Plot, plot, plot, and plot some more. Make the plots look good. Check out ggplot2 in R or matplotlib / seaborn in python. 

Learn to dissect your data. Check out feature engineering. Learn to combine data sets to expand what can be done.

If you want to be a true OG, learn some graphic design principles. Learn to use blank space and color. There is nothing more influential than a beautiful graph. 

Reccs: 

Language Agnostic: [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511409465&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tufte+visual+display)

[GGplot2 book](https://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/331924275X/ref=pd_sim_14_7?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=V86PEMXGW96XK2JF2AHX)

A book on seaborn / matplotlib if using python. 

**4. Figure out the questions you want to ask**

This is perhaps the hardest part. The questions you ask will determine what you find in the data. When thinking about questions, ponder proactively about what techniques you would use to answer them. This is where a broad set of modeling tools comes handy. That will be gone over in the next section.

**5. Analysis**

The most satisfying part in my opinion. When you wrote out your questions, hopefully you have some idea of what techniques you would use. That said, there are a lot of techniques to choose from and each technique has its own special niches. You will learn to select models properly from seeing a lot of data and practicing. Like everything else, practice, practice, practice. Try many models, run them on test sets using cross validation and see what works best. Learn about bias-variance trade-off. 

Generally statistical analysis is broken into 2 parts: 

In descriptive statistics we want to describe the patterns and structure of the data. If you did part 3 well, this will be partially taken care of. You can expand on this as the analysis comes along. 

In inferential statistics we want to predict from the data. This is what we are at now. 

Broadly speaking, this is the content that seems to be spread around the most. I will post some reccs to different courses / books that you will see floating around this subreddit (because they are great).

**Make sure you learn and understand cross validation extremely well.**

**Make sure to understand the assumptions behind each modeling technique you use. There is no one size fits all technique.** 

Since this is such a broad topic, go learn data analysis from books and courses. Learn models, figure out why you would want to use them, and then apply them. 

Once you have completed your modeling, make sure to create a visualization. If others will be seeing it, learn to explain things in simple terms as if non experts will see it. When you are being paid to be a data scientist, it is not about how intelligent you come across, it is about results and understanding for everyone.

**6. The Great Beyond**

After step 5, you are essentially a (good) data analyst. What will differentiate you now will be the extras. Heres some other stuff that you should probably look into: 

* Databases: SQL / Nosql / any query language really. 

* Data Engineering: Create pipelines and automate a lot of the legwork to make raw data usable. 

* Shell: Linux is cool, and bash scripting is useful

* Hadoop, Mapreduce, Spark, AWS, etc: Big Data

* Deep Learning : See what the hype is all about

* Time series analysis: Given the ubiquity of time series data, a book on TSA can't hurt

* Computer Science: Learn CS rigorously. Check out Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, CLRS Algorithms, Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming, and more. If you learn the concepts underlying the technologies you see, you won't be outdated nearly as easily. Tools may change, but the concepts and math stay the same. 

* Learn to love practicing. This list is daunting, but it is completely achievable one small step at a time. Setting aside time to learn and practice daily will get you farther than you could ever imagine. 



**Guide to Learning**

Like all other things in life, there are exciting things and less exciting things. What you find exciting is unique to you, but for the sake of this guide I will give how I would learn the content (assuming you know basic maths and programming): 

* Learn some data analysis. If using python, think stats is nice. If using R, R for Data Science is nice
* Learn how to clean and dissect data. If you read one of the books in the bullet above, you will have learned this.
* Now learn some visualization. Make it pretty with a book on ggplot or seaborn/matplotlib
* Now learn some better tools for analysis: Read and work through Intro to Statistical Learning or Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. Ideally you would do both. 
* Learn database query languages. You will come across databases, so its best to be a wizard with them. 
* Learn hadoop / map reduce / spark for big data
* Learn the theory on a deeper level. [Probability Theory](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) is great, Statistical Inference is great, Bayesian Inference and multilevel modeling is great. 
* Never stop learning

Then Read Through..",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7f71a0/no_background_in_mathstat_or_programming_still/,charudatta2684,1511524619,"Quite often I see a lot of people on Reddit or elsewhere with common questions:  

*	I dont have a background in Mathematics or Statistics or Programming, still can I become a Data Scientist?  

*	I have couple of years of experience not related to this field, I am a Marketing Manager/HR/etc Can I make a shift to Data Science?  

*	Which language is popular R, Python, Matlab, SAS? Do I need to know all of them? Which one should I pick up first?  


So before we answer these, a brief background about me.   
Yes, I graduated in Mathematics (Just rote learned the theorems and solved some algebra &amp; calculus, dont remember anything now!) and there after pursued MBA in Finance. Only time I ever did programming was when I was an 8th grader, and back then at school we used BASIC (How many of you even know there was a language called BASIC?). After that, I only saw computers during my MBA, and all I used was MS Power Point for some shabby presentations and Torrents to watch movies!  

 
Today, I am leading an India based sell-side Quants desk of one of the largest Investment Banks in the world. By leading, I dont mean just people management, thats just 10% of my time, and rest is actually Quantitative Research, apart from building several models, I have built 4 custom packages in R (though cant distribute that outside as they belong to my company now). I started my career in 2008 when I joined a sell side equity research house, but was forced to join Quants desk, just because I had Maths in my CV, about which I hardly knew anything. Though, I was not happy initially, as I actually wanted to analyze stocks and come up with Buy-Sell recommendations, but now I feel that was the best thing that could have happened to me. Things were not as smooth as for my other friends who joined the field in which they had studied, moreover Ive hardly coded anything after my 8th grade, however, I enjoyed my journey, picked up SQL, VBA, OLAP &amp; R along with Quants! And now I am considered a subject matter expert in this field, almost every week  I get a call from a head-hunter to consider Quants/Data Science position in other organizations.  


So long story short  if I can, why cant you? I see myself in the shoes of most people putting these questions. So here is some piece of advice for you, take it if you like it, else there are many other interesting things to read!  


Firstly, stop asking and put your energy into action. Dont just consider data science as its a fad today and everyone is being talking about it, consider it only if you are passionate about it. And youll get to know that only when you get into action. Moreover, remember, nothing is permanent, yesterday it was IT, today its Data Science, and tomorrow may be something else. However, the passionate coders of yesterday are doing much better because of their passion!  

  
Which language should I pick? Id say pick any popular one plus the one that has tremendous help/online community. Both R and Python are very good and at par from data analysis perspective, Python however goes much beyond as you can use it for full software development, build applications etc. But who cares, you need to know these for data analysis and Machine Learning, and both are equally good. Instead of hopping around with several languages Id say stick to one, master it, and then you may explore others. When I interview candidates, though our infra is in R, I dont put that as a necessary condition, anyone familiar with this field would agree, that if you are good in Python, youll easily pick up R and vice-versa. Further top it up with SQL &amp; VBA. SQL because you would be working with huge datasets and mostly, they would be stored in databases rather than Excel. VBA because, it helps a lot in automation and post production activities, plus because of its Macro  Recording feature, its very easy to pick up!  


I know nothing about complex Math/Stat and dont think can easily pick it too?  Who cares, remember this field looks quite glamorous from outside, and if you think you would be building Machine Learning models every day in your life, sorry to disappoint you. Almost 95% of your time would be on data cleansing, analyzing, and feature extraction. Plus as long as you know the working of a Machine Learning model and how to interpret that output, which again can be learned without involving the complex maths, you have ready packages to implement these. Always remember, even a 10th grader can run a RandomForest or SVM or Neural Network, as you have them packaged already, so what you are paid for is to analyze the data and do feature extraction. I would say, as a data scientist, your life is like a soldier  Years of boredom and few Days of excitement  


Lastly and most importantly, dont consider everything for an immediate gain. People typically whether Ill get a job in data science after this. Sorry to be rude, but, Dude, you are investing in yourself and not doing anyone a favor. Moreover youve gone this far, because you said you are passionate about this field. Not everything is liked to money directly, but trust me, if you do it properly it pays off in the long term. Moreover, even if you are working in a non-data science environment, theres so much data around your current job too and you may add so much value and excitement to your current job by picking up these skills!   


I still remember, back in 2010, I was associated with an institute as a part time faculty for CFA exams, apart from my regular job. Once they suddenly requested me to take up session of their newly launched Business Analytics classes in SAS. I had never seen SAS before, but took up the challenge  spent Wednesday night reading The Little Book of SAS &amp; Thursday &amp; Friday night practicing it. After all, by then I was comfortable in R so it was just a change in syntax for me. And delivered the session on Saturday &amp; Sunday and recorded the highest ever feedback points from students! Thereafter I developed passion for this field and Invested a lot of time in learning different models and analysis techniques! Did it help me immediately in my job  NO. However, it paid off in other ways, I was the most sought after faculty for Analytics, I was paid 3X compared to other part-time faculty, in some months, Ive seen my income from these part-time activities to be more than that from my regular job! I even went on to start my own online analytics training academy! Since then Ive seen quite a lot of my students joining Analytics field from a non-analytics background.  


Now, I dont want this post to be a self  promotion exercise, and hence I am not putting the name of my training academy here, but if anyone is interested can ask for the same in comments  


So, what are you waiting for  stop asking and get into action my dear friends!

1. Recommender Systems:  using item based  and user base collaborative filtering, Ii could possibly turn the similarity scores into a list of top opportunities of customers that arent buying products with similarity scores.

2. Association Rules:  It's easy to get association rules. But, turning them into actionable data is a bit harder.

But how?"" topics. This is where I found about numerous resources and books that can be used to study the field. Even though now I have an exhaustive list of resources, I would also like to prioritize them and outline a sequence in which to learn the materials. In addition, some fragments of my plan might be totally wrong or inaccurate, so I would appreciate any kind of advice and recommendations. 

I. Learning Python (since I already have some experience in Python programming, I have decided to stick Python. I'm not even an intermediate Python programmer yet, but I try to learn things on the go. The Python tutorial is of great help.

-- Sometimes I also look through Python Cookbook and Fluent Python to get at least moderately familiar with the best practices for pythonistas. 

Questions:

1. Is it reasonable to stick with just Python? Or should I also get familiar with R?

2. Is it enough to be moderately fluent in Python without knowing the ins and outs?

II. Learning the math

I have a basic command of calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics. Yet, I'm afraid that my knowledge is rather fragmented and I should seriously brush up on linear algebra and statistics. 
There are so many books on the subjects. I have chosen the following:

 - Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra
 - OpenIntro Statistics
 - Probability by Ross to review the basics
 - ISLR (not exactly a textbook to learn statistics, but a very good source of information for the applications)

Questions:

1. Are the sources outlined above exhaustive enough to cover the fundamentals of the math necessary for learning data science and machine learning and understand the algorithms and methods used?

III. The basics of data science

I have come to the conclusion that it could be useful to read a less technical book on what data science deals with first. Not that I have no idea yet - I have been interested in data science and machine learning for a while and read about it on a regular basis. It's just that now I'm trying to get serious about it and make the learning process more structured and organized. 

-- Field Cady - The Data Science Handbook

This is the book I'm considering to be a source of general knowledge and understanding of the field. 

IV. Data Science using Python

This is the most problematic section because there are plenty of well-rated books, and I don't quite understand how much they overlap in coverage.

 - Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas
 - Python for Data Analysis - Wes McKinney
 - Data Science from Scratch - Joel Grus

V. Machine learning

Almost the same situation here, although there are fewer contestants:) 

 - Python Machine Learning by S. Raschka
 - Hands-on machine learning by Aurelien Geron 

General questions:

1. Is there anything I am missing?

2. How much do the books I mentioned above overlap? Is there any use in reading all of them?

3. Are there any other great books that are not included on the lists?

4. There are some popular courses on data science and machine learning. Unfortunately, I learn much better from textbooks than from video courses. Can the books replace those?

5. It might also be the case that the order that I suggested is not optimal. What do you think about it?

This questions is provided to all survival analysis experts.

I'm running model diagnostics on a Cox-Regression model.
One important assumption is the proprotionaly assumption which can be tested using the schoenfeld residual (in R: the coxzph function).

As you can see in the picture below, according to the Schoenfeld test (see in the title) the assumption is violated (H0 is rejected) in the first picture, while it is not violated in the second picture below.

On the other hand, according to the grapical interpretation, the estimated coefficients have to be horizontal in order to hold for the PH assumption. As you can see in the horizontal line, the assumption is clearly not violated in both pictures and hence is a contradiction in the first case.

My question is now: which test has more power, the graphical or the statistical?

Its paid by my employer and looking at the syllabus, there are a lot of videos. Can anyone who has taken the course tell me whether there will be a transcript for the videos and if any of the text is available to download for offline reading? Im more of a text than video person and would like to read it on my morning commute which doesnt always get signal underground. 

Also, I have very basic experience with vba in excel but nothing else so are there stuff that I can read/look into now that you guys would recommend in preparation for the course?

Thank you. ",12,3

I am a PhD student working with some research clinicians at a hospital and they have 5 years of paper-based questionnaires that are being digitised. There are 1200+ surveys with hundreds of questions each and answers that can be in either yes/no or multiple choice format, there's branching within the questions (eg. ""if no to Q.6, go to Q.9""), and personal data security is a major concern.

I have been asked to to create a suitable database for the survey results and then to help with the clinical analysis.

None of the clinicians have any database experience and are mostly MS Excel users. One has ""dabbled"" with MS Access. I have always wanted to get some database management experience and some SQL experience, but haven't really needed to until now.

I have been given two years before the project funding runs out so I have some time to play around and learn and would quite like to get some experience in relational database management and improve my Python and R skills.

Any help or advice on how to get started or what would be the best platforms to use or pointers to where I can get such info would be much appreciated. Thanks!",21,3

Edit:

I'm analysing which independent variables influence the the interaction facebook posts. Interaction as in comments, likes and shares.

&gt; For example:

&gt;IV: Vividness

&gt;DV: Interaction (likes, comments and shares)

&gt;Hypothesis 1: The higher the level of vividness of a facebook post/advertisement, the more
interaction can be found.

As for moderating variables I have Display Size and Country

&gt; For example:

&gt; Hypothesis 1a: The bigger the display size of a smartphone, the more effective is vividness going to influence the interaction on a facebook post.

&gt; Hypothesis 1b: Vividness influences interaction on Facebook posts in country A more than in country B.

A lot of articles and blog posts I've read talk about the ""data analyst""  as a ""junior data scientist"" position. The work is typically characterized by descriptive statistics, database queries, and hand-written reports. Do analysts work alongside or under data scientists, or is the nature of their work typically different enough that there's not significant teamwork?

By extension, what is the data scientist's general role? At this point, is the expertise of a typical data scientist almost exclusively geared toward ML, or are there other use cases for their extensive statistics and mathematics backgrounds? To what extent are data scientists engaged in the data engineering space? Are they just consumers, or are they actively involved in developing and maintaining pipelines?

Finally, we have data engineers. How do they fit into the bigger picture? Are they just building and maintaining pipelines, in essence functioning as data-oriented systems administrators? Are they at all involved in productionalizing models designed by the data science team? How much knowledge of math, statistics, and ML does a data engineer need to be effective in the role? I would assume it's less than a data scientist, but is the theoretical part of the job small enough that this advanced STEM training is nice to know but not particularly functional?

I'm kind of at a crossroads in my career and was thinking of moving into Data Sciences and am hoping for some clarification.

Background about me. I've been working in the SAP sphere for around 10 years now. Initially started out as an SAP Technical Consultant where I spent 4 years on an SAP implementation and during that time I got into Data Analytics and Archiving (especially in BI) which led me to move to a company that specialises in SAP Data Archiving where I've worked for a multitude of clients across industry. My issue is that I think I have hit my ceiling in this field and the repetitive cycle of projects really has hit my motivation.

I am quite worried that I've burrowed myself into a hole due to the unique (and to be fair, highly crap) nature of SAP and I'm concerned that my skills aren't transferable into any other line of work. 

A few of my former colleagues in the SAP BI sphere bit the bullet a few years ago and moved into the Data Sciences sphere as part of their company's direction and they seem to be really enjoying the work they're doing along with the rewards. When asked how they got started? They just said their company threw them into the deep end to figure it out themselves.

I've always had a mathematical and analytical mind (terrible at programming) and was hoping to delve into this sphere. My problem being that I don't have any hands on experience and no certifications to provide.

My questions are:

1. What should I be proficient in? What should I get my certifications in?

2. How critical is it to be well versed in programming languages? This has been my major weak point in both academic and professional life. 

3. Would I have to apply for entry level jobs once I get the first part done? Is there anything in my previous line of work that I can leverage for a different position?

I only ask this because I have heard in order to become a full time data scientist a PhD is very useful and research is a good way to get into a PhD program, whereas an internship is not. I would like to know, that with this considered, would the internship still be more beneficial to become a data scientist than research?

To me, software engineering is a passion and a feeling of self-fulfillment which, when coupled with fruitful projects giving way to advancements in society and humanity as a whole, flares a deeply rooted passion to learn learn learn! This is why, when I first read up on Data Science, I knew that I had honed in on my next target to devour and assimilate into my neural network (yes, the biological one!)

But as I started reading through the hundreds of how-tos, blogs, MOOCS, video tutorials, online books, PDFs and the rest, I only found more frustration with missing pieces to a larger and more obscure logical puzzle that was defiant and unyielding. A feeling of unrest and concern surfaced my mind as I delved more deeply into the subject getting half-baked and limited understanding allowing me to build only by following hand-holding step by step instructions. This wasnotengineering! Trial after trial the matter finally became clear to meThe topic of Data Science strictly refuses totrulyenter a mind until it is imbued with proper mathematical/statistical foundations!

As my reading on Data Science progressed, I would read or hear terms that I knew were key to understanding how Neural Networks worked, but it was just half baked! I started seeing this trend of people seizing the opportunity to piggy back off the Data Science craze and authoring reads and making full fledged online Data Camps that in the end will always avoid the real mechanics behind the subject. They breeze through the parts where mathematical foundations are necessary and move on as if it was a side matter and not required to build reliable models. Take this snippet from a free online book for Neural Networks as an example,

On a related note, the mathematical requirements to read the book are modest. There is some mathematics in most chapters, but its usually just elementary algebra and plots of functions, which I expect most readers will be okay with. I occasionally use more advanced mathematics, but have structured the material so you can follow even if some mathematical details elude you.

Reading through only the second half of Chapter 1: Well also define the gradient of C to be the vector of partial derivatives, We denote the gradient vector by CandThen Equation (9) tells us that CCC=C2.,all prove otherwise and goes against being elementary.

This is why I found myself constantly referring back to tutorials that explained the topic of gradient descent, limits, derivatives, vectors, statistics then go back to continue my reading. But this style of learning left me with a feeling of despair resonating from my logical side whispering, Its not enough, I still want to know WHY and HOW!

Then, one day as I was cleaning up my closet, my eyes suddenly fell on my old collegeSingle Variable Calculusbook by James Stewart. Followed by a sudden dramatic stare and a sense of joy from a reunion with an old friend, an innate feeling told me that an epiphany is about to occur! I opened the book - chapter 1 - and lo and behold! Thisis it. Itsits all there! ITS ALL THERE! Really, all the missing pieces and loose ends were so finely andreliablydescribed that it left no room for confusion. Yes, I do agree that only after having gone through all the Data Science tutorials that Calculus made so much more sense - but it was still a critical piece to the big Data Science puzzle.

The point Im driving here is that I feel that there are many fields in I.T. that are slowly being driven by marketing objectives and quick responses to technology hypes rather than the classic RT*M way of deeply rooted old school developers. Head hunters are scouring to find anyone that can fit the description screening people through checkoff lists and how many years of rather than searching for minds withchemical Xwhich in turn forces future Data Scientist to prepare to become real engineers. The pressure coming down from this flawed style of talent selection is slowly giving rise to a batch of cooky cutter engineers that sparks worry given the way the entire field of I.T. ties in together. Security, reliability, scalability and general advancements in I.T. are all negatively effected by allowing the field to grow without well founded roots. Take how Android programming tutorials started as a classic example. The push and drive behind most of the videos, MOOCs, and tutorials was to quickly jump on the demand and make things seem as easy as possible to drivemore readersandnottowards making strong android engineers. This finally resulted in poor android engineers that designed poorly designed apps making way for many security and stability issues. I believe this is the same trend that is taking place in the Data Science field.

In summary, if you really want to understand Data Science in a way that will allow you to have a positive impact and pave the way for your future in this ever growing field then I strongly suggest studying the basics really well - along with all the MOOCs, videos and tutorials that are stillkeyin understand Data Science and Machine Learning.",27,61

Be it as it may, I have an internship offer for next semester at a big bank, and my supervisor said that contingent on job performance and funding, they are always looking to make the interns into a full time hire. 

Anyway, I have a question vis-a-vis qualification.

Looking at postings, I find that a lot of data science / big data / machine learning jobs require advanced degrees in fields such as CS or statistics. I am wondering - **if I stop at a BA, can my experience down the road overshadow against the lack of higher degree? I am scared that I will be stuck in junior roles without an advanced degree.**

If I drop my classes next semester to focus on the internship, I will have to wait a full year before taking MA classes again because they are not available every semester. This won't be a problem if I'm offered an extension. But I'm fucked if they don't give me an extension. I also have a small startup that has a few potential clients, but the company is still in the valley of death. Chances are I won't return to studies full-time if I drop next semester. ",2,2

So basically I'm a Civil Engineer looking to learn data science to branch deeper into Civil Engineering. I'm currently in a Masters of Civil Engineering concentrating in Transportation engineering and employed as a Traffic/ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) Engineer. I will likely be doing a thesis involving a work project that involves managing data from various systems along highways, cleaning up them up and then analyzing that data to give a generalized health report of the highway at the time. I'll be looking at traffic counts relative to time and position, vehicles entering and exit the highway, speed of vehicles travelling in time and space, etc. I wont be working on this alone, but I would like to learn more about the data side so I know what to actually research for that portion of my thesis.

My current knowledge base in math is calc 1-3, diff eq. and linear algebra. Statistically I have taken a general undergraduate stats class, a graduate modeling in transportation class that taught R and graduate statistics in transportation class that taught a few statistical models (OLS, Poisson, negative binomial, multi. logit, nested logit, probit, etc), I don't feel like I understand much statistics I learned though, like I know what models are and when to use some, but I google alot when I'm doing homework and still unclear in the end. My programming is fairly weak, I only know basic matlab, a program called nlogit and some basic R (can run some models). I can kind of clean data, but a little uneasy, would like to learn how to do this better.

Overall I'm looking for a place to a start. Do I learn python? SQL? Focus on R? Also coming from a non stats/math/CS background is there anything conceptually I need to learn?

Also, dumb question. Whats the difference between data science and analytics?

While I'm at it, another dumb question. What is an ELI5 definition of what things such as hadoop, hive and pig are? Are they programming languages or technology platforms?
