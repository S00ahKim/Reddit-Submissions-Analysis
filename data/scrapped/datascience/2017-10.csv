As a data engineer I've been tasked with coming up with a reasonable take-home assignment for a data scientist candidate. 

I am aware this should most likely be done by a senior data scientist rather than myself, but it appears to be the case that due to circumstances I am the best man for the job. Hence this question; 

Could you give me any tips or pointers as to how I could create the best possible take-home assignment? 

What I've come up with; 

- Give the candidate a cleaned-up dataset and notebook containing customer activity over an n-week period
- Task the candidate with creating a classifier that predicts wether or not a given user will churn. AKA will this user be a loyal retaining customer over a certain period t, or not (= churn) 
- Ask the candidate to clarify their presented solution, which algorithm(s) they might have used and why. 
- Ask the candidate to determine and list the importance of each feature in the churning model   

What I could use help with; 

- This is a very practical assignment, perhaps little theoretical insight is demonstrated. Should I put more emphasis on the algorithms the candidate might use? SVM, nearest-neighbour, gradient boosting... Perhaps ask for them to make a comparison and choose what they think is the best possible option? 

- I feel I should incorporate a few steps; The first question should be easy, the second of reasonable difficulty and the last one preferably frustratingly hard. Ideally this last one tests the candidates ability to handle hard situations and how they mitigate and communicate them. The perfect answer would be something along the lines of ""I tried to apply approach A, B and C to little avail. I feel that if we want to meet the goal represented in the question, perhaps we should be concerned with ingesting specific data. For example a user's X and Y datapoints would be a good place to start."" 

Thanks in advance!

The main method involves dividing coin price movement over a long timeframe (one or 2 years) to different phases and ignoring short term noises. Crypto Currencies are traded just like stocks so the system will be similar.

I started learning data science in python for this and other similar purposes last month (I am doing undergraduate in computer science and have strong programming knowledge but my mathematical knowledge is bad (Upto A Level Maths)). I want to create a system for it because it will be faster and it will remove bias and i can experiment other stuffs too. I learned the basics of data science and charting from udemy and now have started doing Machine Learning Courses in coursera and datacamp along with quantopian and financial courses from udemy. Because of my weak mathematical background - i have been doing some extra work on Theoretical Machine Learning courses.

Where should i focus more of my time on to create such a system? I want to complete all these courses but i want to learn enough to create a system like this first if it is possible (Easier to continue learning when you have something for it) Is learning Machine Learning suitable for a task like that (I have done some basics and i am not sure yet)?

Hi, I graduate highschool this year and am quickly growing more and more interested in data science. However im very confused with the path I need to take to work in your field. I have a lot of questions and they're all very jumbled, bare with me please.

-What university majors/programs should I take? Mathematics, statistics, computer science, economics, am i going to need a combined or double major?

-Is it useful to take any buisiness/finance (or even a science like chemistry) as a minor?

-I've seen a couple undergrad Data Science programs, but im skeptical (maybe wrongly so) that it would be too broad or not be as applicable as for example a degree in computer science would be. If i see a program labled data science does it contain everything i need and should i just jump right in?

-Is actuarial science a possible pathway? Is it similar at all to data science?

-Will i need a masters or phd to have success in finding a job? Or will a bachelors do just fine with coop programs/internships being very important?

-I'm likely to go to university in western Canada, ie: UBC, UVIC UofA, UofC, SFU etc... So if anybody has any insight or experience with any of those schools and their programs that would be insanely helpful!

25,2017-10-2,2017,10,2,23,73sznq,"R is said to have a higher learning curve, but I've found Python to be far, far more complex for the simplest tasks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/73sznq/r_is_said_to_have_a_higher_learning_curve_but_ive/,Xilc,1506953483,"I always hear people telling me R has a higher learning curve. That's pretty much a signature statement for them. But python is much, much more complex. They have lists, data frames, arrays, tuples, dictionaries, LISTS of dictionaries, and I'm probably missing a bunch of other forms of storing data. For R, it's almost dumbfounding how straightforward it is. You have vectors, and you can still create dataframes. Also, you have the tidyverse, which makes working with data easier than a day at the golf course. 


Much of Python's packages are dramatically more complex as well. Take web scraping. You have to use beautifulsoup/bs4, and then you have to import lxml, and then you parse it with some arbitrarily complex code. On R, you just read_HTML, use rvest to read it in, and you're set. You can literally [scrape a page in R in less than 6 lines! ](https://youtu.be/gSbuwYdNYLM?t=166) They pull an entire table from Calpoly's admissions site, in SIX LINES! [The same operation in Python is quite arbitrary and is a frivolous venture](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/). Look how long this freaking tutorial is, just to scrape the simplest page! What is worse about this example is that rvest will look for ALL tables, in the entire page, and then you just specify what you want. But for python, you have to use a ridiculous for loop to loop over every single table you want. This pretty little example makes it seem like you're going to have a gleaming and wonderful output, which really isn't the case. 

Here is some code for a 'simple' webscraping script for Python I found on the web on the suggestion of an expert Python programmer: 

#########################
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request


from urllib.parse import urlencode



from bs4 import BeautifulSoup



url = 'https://opir.fiu.edu/instructor_evals/instr_eval_result.asp'



data = {'Term':'1171', 'Coll':'%', 'Dept':'','RefNum':'','Crse':'','Instr':''}



r = urlopen(Request(url, data=urlencode(data).encode()))



html = r.read().decode()




soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')




tables = soup.find_all('table')
#########################



Yes, this is SO much simpler than R, especially to a novice who has barely ever programmed (/s)! Plus, the code doesn't work, and results in a nasty error: 


**'UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 5779573: invalid continuation byte'**


Do you really think a novice is going to understand what this is, or how to solve this issue? 



In addition, installing packages or libraries in Python as a beginner is downright infuriating. After installing Python, you have to literally MAP pip to your environment variables on your PC. This took me several hours working on an older machine (I have no control over the OS used on some of the machines I work on), as it wasn't easy to locate, and even when I found it, it simply wouldn't accept the directory without extensive troubleshooting. The alternative isyou can download Anaconda/miniconda, but then, depending on your IDE, you have to go into your settings and choose which interpreter to use... The default, or the anaconda. 

In R, guess what you do? Go to packages, click install, type the package, done. Then you click the checkbox to enable it. No interpreters, no editing environment variables, or spending hours fussing over errors you get with Python. Anyone got wonna dem Staples EASY buttons ?


tl;dr: Everything is more complex in Python. R is the boogeyman to those who haven't put the slightest effort into learning it, but Python involves doing far more work for the same result, with much more frustration **if you are a novice**. I have no doubt that in eight years, after working with Python for years, that I will have a sufficient grasp on it. But as a novice, Python has a lot more to learn than R does. I'm not saying Python is a horrible language, but I am saying that it most certainly isn't as novice/user friendly as it claims, and it's a bit harsh that the data community makes R look like the boogeyman when in reality, it's the friendly neighbor willing to help.

If you're consulting you could even bill out the service to your own clients at your hourly rate, allowing you to increase your earnings per hour.
Thanks in advance for any feedback!

A bit of background: I graduated as a Civil/Structural Engineer some years ago and spent some time working as an engineer but I realised I never really liked it. I was considering a master's either for expertise in a certain field or for career change but i decided i didn't want/it wasn't worthy. So while i was trying to figure out what i want to work on I started taking small random projects (excel/translations/data entry) on freelancer.com (lol) two of which led to a remote ""position"" in two start ups. 

The first is kind of irrelevant, but the second was a start up developing an AI platform for logo recognition (which they succeeded and they were acquired by a very big company) where i spent almost two years. Initially my role there was ""data entry"" (tagging/annotating logos/videos using their program) then i was kind of in charge of myself and a group of four regarding this data entry (plan how to distribute work to do it faster and meet the strict deadlines) + checking/reporting on the after-training results if they seem logical or odd or any other observation (nothing that needed more than common sense and basic maths understanding) and in the end i was offered to join their QA team. Of course at the time i didn't even know what QA is or does since i was never involved/following the cs or it field, but anyway i suffered from a burnout and had to stop working for a few months. 

So fast forward some months ago, their offer still stood but I was still considering what i want to do and anyway i decided i wanted to be involved with data science. I was researching what and how but nothing seems clear enough. I know that my education isn't enough to be looking to become a data scientist and I never aspired for a big career anyway but I want to work on something relevant. I always had an interest in data and very good understanding of maths and statistics but i never really occupied myself with those other than my studies with the exception of some statistics i was checking myself.


My maths level is typical ce stuff i.e calculus, linear algebra, integrals, matrices, regression etc (it's been years so i dont really remember clearly what ive done) and i know there are more complex stuff i need to catch up but i think it's just time that i need. Regarding coding i almost lack any coding background, which i hate to not know what i don't know, so i started teaching myself python. Of course i know that i don't have fundamental knowledge in cs which makes me feel stupid, I always hated application without knowing the theory. Machine learning, algorithms, neural networks are stuff i also lack almost any real knoweldge. 

In a matter of months i'll be moving to the UK anyway and this is where I need your assistance. I know I can't learn/refresh everything in a few months and don't have yet a clear view on the aspects of data science but also i don't clearly know what my knoweldge should be for a given position. I mean i'm not even sure about what positions exist. From my understanding till now what suits me better is less formal coding more analysis but not too deep in maths yet.

So what i really want from you, judging on the above, is to guide me by telling me what position i should go for and what is needed for that. I know i can ""fake"" these two years as having a proper position eg operations manager or qa if i learn python by then. I think i can focus and learn 2-3 of the following in the given time (i know believing you know and applying it in a real job can be far from each other): python sql visualization maths

Try to learn python by finishing an online course on python for data science and try to experiment with it?
Or instead try SQL?
Try to learn the most out of these or focus on specific tasks? Or instead master VBA excel and study those while working?
Focus on refreshing maths or visualization?
Should i try and fake i know more on these that i already know and work+learn or no?

But yea that's the general idea. 

How could one approach such a problem, is text-mining the right approach or should be we looking into AI/Machine Learning techniques or a combination of the two? I read a bit about Bayesian Probabilities and how using previous results sets you get a matrix table of probabilities and that's used to determine where new data would be categories. Is this the best approach or are there alternatives we should be looking at? How do we even get the first set of probabilities if that's the way we went, would we have to go through a bunch of emails and classify them manually to get an initial result set?

Hey there, so, question is the title haha.

I would prefer not to just throw in a covariance mateix and select from there.  Im aware of a good deal of the LA behind PCA why it is not considered a factor selection method-but as pca maximizes variance along a new set of axis closest to the data space-could i use the loadings to select the variables with the highest degree of variance?

so in a nutshell: for an experiment where the variability and correlation between the variables is the only set of selection criteria, can pca or another analgious method be useful from a more statistical perspective?Thanks for your input!",6,5

I'm a n00b here, and I'm looking for some suggestions.

I'm building a new ETL, and starting to focus on the ""E"" step. I have not been able to find an existing project which seems to cover my requirements, so far. I could build my own, but I'd love to not reinvent the wheel if I don't have to.

This service extracts data from several different APIs, for hundreds of different companies each. Each one of these API calls can then dynamically generate an arbitrary set of additional API calls in turn, to be launched in parallel.

A hypothetical example: I call an API to grab all x subreddits from Reddit. Then, for each of these x subreddits, I then call the API again to grab all y posts. Then for each of these y posts, I again call the API to grab all of the z comments.

Given this hypothetical, you can see that you end up with a tree of execution, where each node in the tree can produce n number of additional child nodes, to be processed in parallel.

What I am talking about here is some mix of a web crawler (except more constrained to well understood, but varying APIs) and a batch processor. I need each of these nodes logically separated like this, so that if one fails, it only stops execution for the possible nodes that come after, but not the nodes at it's same level.

I've looked into building this as a set of microservices, using an event bus to schedule jobs for a pool of workers. Then I could record the state of each of these paths, and track when something fails, and be able to debug and retry.

I would love some suggestions for this, or an idea of other projects that look very similar, so that I might gain some inspiration from them.

Thanks!

Edit: I've looking into Airflow and Luigi, but they seem better as proper workflow orchestrators. Perhaps even as the rest of the ETL, once the data has already been aggregated from these various APIs. Another was AWS Batch, but it's not very mature, and the UI stinks. If you disagree with either of these interpretations, by all means, lemme hear why :)",0,0

I'm learning the ins and outs of scikit learn and found that there doesn't seem to be a straightforward way to calculate p-values for coefficients without either doing it manually or pulling in another library. I Googled around a bit for the reason behind that and came across [this thread from r/PyStats](https://www.reddit.com/r/pystats/comments/3c6idg/sklearn_stderrorspvaluesttest/).

The relevant part is here: 

&gt; The point of sklearn is ML and, in the end, ML really only values accuracy. Whether a model or an individual feature/predictor is ""significant"" is not relevant.

How true is that statement? In applied ML, do organizations typically not care as much about p-values for coefficients, so long as the results are accurate?

My question is, do you working professional script out long SQL/R/Python code directly on to the command line, or do you use an editor like sublime, save the code in it's respective file format, and then execute the file via the command line?

I have two job offers and I'm having a really difficult time choosing which one (its a wonderful predicament to be in).  I'd like to get your opinions on how I should go about making this decision.  I recently graduated with a B.S. in math and I've been wanting to work in machine learning and artificial intelligence.  My dream job in the future would be working on the cutting edge in the fields of data science/ML/AI, in a large tech company like FB, Spotify, Google, etc.  I am from NYC.

Here are the factors between the two companies:

Type of company: Tech startup vs. government contracting (consulting gov agencies) firm

Salary: 83k vs 90k with similar benefits.

Location: NJ (1 hour from NYC, where I'm from) vs. Washington D.C.  

Size: Similar, &lt;50 people

Culture: I visited the office of the tech company and it seems to have wonderful people/culture.  On the other hand, I did not visit the office of the D.C. company and I dont have a great idea on their culture.  In fact, I only had 1 phone interview with them before they decided to give me the offer (only because they were pressured that I already had another offer and would be accepting soon).

People Id be working with: Tech firm has 1 other data analyst whom I will be working in tandem with, along with product managers. Gov firm has a few other data analysts, mostly working on the lower level analytics.  I will be the first hire in the gov firm with focus on more of the advanced analytics, and will be mentoring others.

Responsibilities: 

Tech firm: Data analyst title, working mostly with AB testing and experimentation of apps, building reports/dashboards on KPIs/metrics, building models for customer LTV and predicting churn, as well as pricing optimization. Explore how advanced analytics can be applied throughout the company.

Gov firm: Data scientist title, developing data analysis solutions that include ML/AI to client problems such as giving input on data infrastructure, and building machine learning models (very high level overview of responsibilities, as it is dependent on the client problems).  

I am from NYC so in terms of location, I am leaning more towards NJ to stay close to friends and family.  Ive always wanted to work in tech as well, but the government job seems to have more of a focus on ML/AI than the tech firm.  On the other hand, Ive heard that government jobs dont have as much flexibility with the work, as it is all about meeting client needs.  
Are there any other factors that I should consider?  Is there anything else I should consider in regards to working for government clients and how that could affect the kind of work Id be doing?  Just looking for any kind of input that could help with making my decision.  Ultimately, I don't think either choice would be wrong but I want to optimally position myself to work on even bigger things in the future.

Also, thanks to the data science community here in Reddit.  Ive been browsing a lot in the last year and have learned a lot from this sub.  So happy to finally achieve my dream of landing a DS-related job and I would be happy to share my experiences.  

Update:

Thanks for all the insights.  I decided to accept the offer at the tech firm, main reasons being proximity to home, culture that supports personal growth and fun, and wariness of red tape at government firm.  As someone pointed out, there's much less uncertainty working at the tech firm and I'm sure I'd be happy there.",16,5

       I've done research in different subreddits and  google ,i've been able to figure out how to get into Data Science. So I've figured out what I should learn and it's definitely something I want to go into and would get passionate about. I love what I do, but i think I want to try something different and challenging now.  etc.
I just need a few clarifications.


My background
  I have a BSc in Information technology. I currently work as a Systems/Business Analyst for one of the top 3 ERP companies. My domain is mainly in supply chain mangement. I have about 7 years experience as a systems/business analyst.

  I have a somewhat intermediate knowledge with programming especially in Java. Because i do maintenance and sometimes I have to debug and I write scripts with Jmeter for automation testing. So my algorithms and SQL knowledge i would say is intermediate. On the side I also do freelancing of web development. Mostly just wordpress sites.


So I understand I need to learn Python and maybe R. I was very good in mathematics and physics in high school.  I Had an A in all the mathematics and statistics courses I took in college. But I might have to have refresher courses which i think I would grasp easily.


So my plan now is to increase my side income (I create contents for people From Articles, to graphics, social media content etc) and I also have a small business on the side) for the next 6 months and learn all I have to learn to go into Data Science or Machine learning. After 6 months, quit my job and get a masters while still self studying and working on ML or DS projects. I come from Philippines and did college there so getting a Masters either in Europe or the US will increase my market value if I have to get jobs in western countries.
	Seeing my Background and domain experience in Supply chain Management, 


	what would you advise to get a masters in? And what areas do you think I can focus on while self studying and working on DS and ML projects ?
	 What path would you advise me to take? Data Scientist or Machine learning Engineer.
Looking forward to anything you can advise me on.
Thanks

I have an MA in English and a year of doctoral work, so I understand academia, but I never followed through. I also have a decent amount of STEM training (calculus through multivariate, differential equations, introductory linear algebra, discrete math, C++ programming, data structures, engineering stats), but that's now 10-15 years ago, and I'm pretty rusty.

I actually started down this path looking into web development in Python, but before I made much headway, a work project led me to look at the publicly-available Medicare cost reports for nursing homes. While looking into how exactly I would extract and analyze the data, I read up on SQL, Python, and pandas, which led me to articles on the current state of data science. For the first time in a long time, I found something that made me go, ""I want to do that.""

So long story short, my actual math, stats, and programming chops are just not there. I can remember bits and pieces of my college courses,  but I haven't touched the material in over a decade. I've read a lot of this subreddit, and I came across [OSSU's Data Science Program](https://github.com/ossu/data-science). After a lot of hemming and hawing, I finally started, but thumbing through everything, I realized that this is approximately 4 years of material following the stated guidelines, which are admittedly quite lax (5-12 hours of work a week).

Still, that's a long, long time, but I also realize that this is a field full of PhDs, so there has to be something said for the knowledge base required to perform the work. I have 2 major questions:

1) Can anyone comment on the quality of the coursework and actual course layout? I really like the introductory linear algebra course. I really feel like I'm getting insight into the material, not just learning to solve homework problems.

2) Short of enrolling in a structured program, which isn't an option right now, is there any other (faster) way to get a solid foundation to be able to work as a data scientist? A lot of online MS programs assume a technical background that I don't have.

I'm not desperate to get out of my career by any means, but it's definitely something I want to transition away from in the future, and I'd like to start pivoting now, whatever that looks like. Data science just seems like the most interesting avenue at the moment.

I realize that you can make a pretty good living running queries and generating reports, but that's not particularly interesting to me. To use an example I'm familiar with, while you can find very useful information doing queries from the Medicare cost reports (e. g., average nursing wages), the much more interesting questions to me aren't nearly as simple and, from my uninformed perspective, seem to require more sophisticated tools:

* Are there relationships between amounts and types of spending and profitability?
* Can a nursing home's cost report be used to predict its 5-star quality report?
* Is the nursing home industry going to see expansion, stagnation, or contraction in the coming years?

Any insight would be appreciated!",4,15

so I hope I can ask you people how to handle the following:

Until now I usually worked with local R Code to run and re-run models I built with R. In my new role, I work as an architect on deploying built R models into a productive environment. We have a Hadoop environment to work with.

Could you give me suggestions on how to run R in a productive system?

My hunch is that using Hadoop we could use RHadoop to write Map/Reduce code. But this would entail changing the algorithm wouldn't it? How do you rewrite algorithms to fit a Map/Reduce paradigm?

Open for suggestions!

How do you feel about products marketed like this? I am starting to get the impression that people view machine learning as another set of python libraries to solve an engineering problem rather than a practice rooted in math and science.

I haven't worked with this specific product, so I don't know how their system works. It is hard to tell where the line is between ""democratizing"" machine learning and irresponsible practice where all analysis is automated.

Hi guys and girls, I'm here to find some advice from some nice strangers on the internet :) . Before you roast me and tell me to go use the search button or the wiki, please know I already lurked through it. 

Keeping that in mind,

I'm a senior in undergrad (3 year bachelors where I'm from) in a B.B.A. specialised in Business intelligence. Since the term is pretty broad and based on what I read here I figured it was pretty similar so thats why I'd like your inputs on what to do next. 

For my undergrad profile, I'm in top school in my area (Eastern Canada) with a &gt; 3.5 GPA. I'm participating in many academic competitions and just recently came back from a student exchange in Singapore. 

In my school, BI major has classes that ressemble a mix of IT,math,Finance and marketing. Essentially we will learn SQL and NoSQL through Microsoft Server, SAS through data projects where we learn to extract format and analyse data,Tableau to visualize , Java where we develop applications and on my end I took a VBA class (I was going in finance until very recently). 

When I speak with recruiters, the response I get will be that they are super interested in hiring anyone with a BI oriented degree. For example: I went to see a big hedge fund this week and they were recruiting for Private Equity positions and I asked them if they needed BI majors and they were almost begging me to apply (at least that was the feeling I got).

That being said I'm really torn between heading to do a masters degree and working next year.For the masters, I have two options that I'm considering: Studying at my local university or going to France and studying at a Grande cole (their Ivy league). I'd like to highlight that I'm bilingual (English and French) so there wouldn't be a language barrier. 

So heres where I specifically need input: 
I read about the war between Python and R on this sub (I feel that I would want to learn one eventually) but for the moment is SAS sufficient to work ? 

Will I learn significantly more by going to do a masters or by working 
? 

Will I be at a significant disadvantage compared to actual programmers or math majors ?

Will the masters significantly boost my salary ? (The statistics aren't widely available on the schools website since the programs are so new) 

TL DR: currently in school torn between grad school and work; know SAS but no R or Python don't know if it puts me at a massive disadvantage. Any input is appreciated :)

The problem:
We give out discount codes in our emails the way many companies do. We noticed that the incremental revenue (revenue per customer) on some of these code-centric campaigns was lower than the holdout groups, leading me to believe that some of the customers receiving codes would have placed an order regardless of having received a code.

I wanted to test this hypothesis.

For example: Customer A orders every Monday and spends an average of $20 per order. His order patterns don't change upon receiving a code, but he'll use a code if given one. All of a sudden, due to discounts, we're getting an average of $15 per order from this customer because of the frequency with which we send codes.

I am Junior college student with Statistics major and Computer Science minor. My plan is to work as a data analyst after graduation, and then, in the next few years when I've gained decent work experience as well as earned my Master Degree in Statistics, I will try to be officially a Data Scientist. 

For this Summer, I am trying to apply for a Data Analytics internship. I've talked to a few people on Reddit about my qualifications to apply, and they said it would be great if I can put a project using statistical programming languages. Now, as I only have the knowledge equivalent to the first semester of a year-long Applied Probability and Statistics course, I don't think I can do much with fancy data analysis or machine learning. Hence, I try to focus on Data Cleaning and Visualization, which I can compensate the lack of knowledge by my coding skill. 

For the project, I intend to perform a study of 10 - 15 graphs, charts and their applications. For instance, when to use boxplot and what we can learn from it. I will choose some not-too-dirty data sets to perform basic cleaning as well. And all the code for graphs, charts and cleaning work will be available in both R and Python. There will also be brief analysis regarding descriptive statistics for each graph.
With that idea being said, do you have any advice or idea on which kind of graphs I should include and which datasets I should use to make those graphs? It would be great if we have a website that provides comprehensive information about various kinds of graphs.

Also, as a beginner, I am still a bit unclear about data cleaning. I know dirty data may be missingness, incorrect data, or bad-formatted data, etc. but overall, given a dataset, I may not know how to conclude when the data is clean enough for me to do all the work.

UTD has a longer program with an internship vs. SMU's 9 month program. I feel that would be more beneficial for me as someone without relevant experience. There are more classes to choose from with an ability to focus (financial, healthcare, marketing etc).

I am going back to school for either data science or analytics the choice is mine. 

At the end of the day for me the best part of analytics is thinking through how to solve the problem and then solving it. A lot of the time this is looking at data and determining how to use it. I however do want to present the data and help with corporate strategy.

In terms of prior knowledge I am my background is statistics and regression creation and analysis, however I am quite the beginner in programming. I know a bit of SQL and am very strong in Excel - I can generally hold my own with conversations with developers.

My fear with data analytics is I'll lack the fundamentals of extracting data. Currently I work with CRM and play with the data in Excel. But this route I have been told helps climb the corporate ladder.

For data science, I've been told there is not much climbing but you'll be a ""data monkey"" for the rest of your life (granted I'm sure that was a biased opinion). I'll extract and clean the data then my role is complete.

These are the two programs in question. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Is this a smart transition. What are the limitations/strengths with either route.

So, I downloaded months of recent years' data from greatsource.com, which included the opening lines, the 3-ways. These lines are based on their estimate of the three probabilities: the visitor will win; the home team will win, there will be a tie.

Transforming those lines to underlying probabilities (requiring the removal of the profit fudges to the probabilities) it proved that the vis and hom probabilities rendered r^2s of around .72, usually, for the total score.  Only around .16 or so usually for the winning margin.

Along the line, these past few months, I recalled seeing a data analysis concept concerning entropy, the idea that different levels
of result evidence different energy levels. Net zero; heat death of the universe? The concept didn't fit anywhere near perfectly but I decided to look into it. You could take the actual score margins as your data, but -6 to +6. Could add 6 to get a number? Yuck?

[Innyhoo, no way the new variable could take into account the visitor's contribution!]

I transformed each result to the number of games ending with the worst home result (usually the -6) and for the next result up added to that first number the number with this second result. Etc. Peak differences in the levels being at -1 or 0 results.

You remember me saying around .16? Here, the MR R^2 was around .81!  
 
And not worth much more of a darn compared to the R^2 .16 MRs are far as I could discover as I struggled my way to the near loss of my tiny online bankroll, abandoning the totals (R^2 .72) in my fanatic, frantic tries to make the ""entropy"" mis-use work.

I am working on a model that takes a lot of different variables, most un-ordered categorical, but some could be ordered, and others integers, and produces a single floating point valuue (currency).

For example, the training data may look like this:

Name (index) | Weight |Age | Origin | Material | Condition | Price
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Vase #1| 3.25 kg | 60 | USA | Porcelain | Flawless | $40.00
Vase #2| 2.00 kg | 80 | China | Porcelain | Scratched | $25.00
Arm Chair | 20 kg | 40 | Mexico | [Wood, Leather] | Flawless | $100.00
...
I have about 10,000 richly populated rows like this. Now I'd like to train a model that makes connections between how the Weight, Age, Origin, Material and Condition affect the price of an artifact, and can predict the value of a new item based on current data.

For example:

Name (index) | Weight |Age | Origin | Material | Condition | Price
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Playboy Magazine | 0.10 kg | 45 | USA | Paper | Mint| ???


My thoughts so far:
Intuitively, I would want the building block of my model to be pair-wise relationships between variables, while the rest are being held constant:

For example, I would expect that weight and price would be positively correlated at low values. I would also expect that the slope of that graph would be fairly constant for all Porcelain objects, and that the slope might be steeper (price/weight of material) for porcelain than for, plastic, say.

I need your expertise reddit, what is the best way to go about doing this? Is there a specific type of model I want to look up? What tools would you use to go about doing this? I've collected the data using python, so ideally I would be able to keep working in python for the analysis and visualization components.

I have taken a good amount of modeling, stat, and numerical classes but my gpa is bad (mid-low 2's) Also I have no internships.

I tried making up for this with auditing some of coursera, datacamp for python, and eventually finding my freelance work but it seems like full time recruiters are very hesitant to continue with my app after seeing my gpa. (makes sense)

GW's boot camp seems the best for me, since the others will either require relocation or later finishing times due to prereq scheduling. It goes over excel, sql, python for ml (not neural nets...), visualization, hadoop, and ends with a capstone in 24 weeks.

I believe I can do this while getting another freelance project starting Feb 2018. Is the $10k worth, as I will obv try very hard upon joining it, or should I just spam job apps for anything related to data, soft eng, etc while doing freelance next year?

*GW takes a security deposit which, if I get in, will be paid in about a month so after that I wont be applying for full time jobs then. Thanks!

I'm slightly frustrated because I'm trying to figure out the factor scores/correlation scores of the ith original variable on the jth PC in matrix form-but as I said I'm being confused here.

Let's start with what I think I Understand Suppose I have a data matrix X, columns are variables, rows are observations.  Then my covaraince matrix can be estimated via X^T*X, where X^T denotes the Transpose of X.  This has Singular value decomposition X^T*X = USV^T, where U and T are unitary, and S is the diagonal matrix of singular values and U is called the right eigenvectors of my svd.

If my covariance matrix is real and pos semi def, then my eigenvalues and singular values coincide, and my right eigenvectors are the eigenvectors of X^X 

Now, When I hear loadings of my variables on PC J, I think of the column vector A which is the weights of each original vectors in the linear combination that determines PC J.

When I hear Scores I think of the 'Distance"" of the projection along a pc by an original data column. 

Now, according to some of the literature I've read, the scores of my original are equal to U*S, as V*X is equivalent to this under matrix multiplication, and V is the matrix of weight coefficients used to construct pc J from the linear combination of my original variables.  When I think of the loading of factors, I think of this V.

Now-where I'm really confused is how I compute the correlation matrix of pc J and Variable I, because, As stated, I can't differentiate the two in some of my literature.

I would very much appreciate some help on this, and the more Linear Algebra detail you can give me the better!  Please let me know If i should give more detail!  ",0,2

MS level pure cell/molec biology (Sep 2016) here, looking for major career advice. Been working for the past year in a medical device company and looking for jobs. I have an interest in data and I would like to limit my time at the bench. To be honest, job prospects don't look hot and I want to gain real, marketable skills.  

My situation as of now: 

-0 formal stats courses besides 1 formal psychology stats course that used SPSS (I took it in 2010).

-Some low level stats use in my experiments in graduate school and my work now. Excel and Minitab. I'd liken this to ""intro level stuff"": F-test, paired, unpaired t-tests, chi square, anova etc.

-Looking into Intro to Stats course at a local CC in the evenings.

-I am teaching myself Python right now, from various book sources + Udemy. The goal is also to get to R as well. Python and R appear to be major players in biology data. 


Questions:

-Is another MS degree necessary? I am not afraid of finding a working professional program, I am willing to do it.

-Bioinformatics or Data Science? Is bioinformatics too specific if I wanted to leave biology someday? Is data science ok for bioinformatics because I have a strong biology background?

-Top skills that you recommend- Python, R, SQL, etc?

-Can you really land interviews with data analyst/data scientist jobs with a profile on GitHub?

-Any other advice, please!

I like the mentor-ship program with springboard and how you can work at your own pace. They also guarantee a job within 6 months or a refund. I meet all of the qualifications for the job guarantee. I have a bachelors in Business Administration with a minor in information technology.  I've also read that they basically just take the courses from Coursera and you could find most of their lessons for free.  The program seems to require an advanced knowledge of at least python beforehand.

Udacity has designed their own courses and it is much cheaper overall. They also break the course down into two terms with the first being more of an introduction. They have set deadlines on the course material though.

They both have great reviews from what I have read online. There are two intro workshops with springboard but I feel I could prepare for the career track class with a much cheaper alternative. I have some background with python and statistics but I want to be prepared as possible before I jump in.

To prepare for one of these two classes I was looking into these intro courses online.

It was filled with tons of tables in which all of the samples were neatly laid out with how many people sampled, and the number of responses for each. This is where I get most of my sample data to plot python for practice. 



Not only is it super cool to be able to look at past data, but also, it is awesome knowing that I will never, ever be able to get to all of it. The library is about a quarter-mile long, and we are talking about seven floors just filled with hundreds of bookcases with reference materials from every subject. Philosophy, journal of experimental zoology, comparative neurology, government records dating back almost 60 years. But this is just one library. Think about it. I would literally never be able to collect and analyze the data in every single book. It just wouldnt be possible. So if youre looking for some really cool sample data or something to plot, check the reference section at a library or your nearest University. The possibilities are in list, and what you may find will surprise you.



As an aside, I will say this about the book that I found and picked up completely at random The data detailed an era in which people were polarized against homosexuality. Many felt that it was an illness, many felt that they should not be allowed to show public affection or even organize together peacefully in the same place. This is completely objective data that was contained within this book. People were surveyed, and these were the responses. Most of the responses range from half to 3/4 opposing homosexuality. Just thought someone might find this interesting. Please, dont bring your politics into this discussion. This is purely a discussion of data science",5,1

I'm in my early 30s with a tenure-track professorship in physics.  For a variety of reasons (mobility, pay, and dislike of teaching undergraduate classes among them), I'm considering making a move to data science.  My research, analysis and statistics skills are strong. I've used Python, R, SQL in my research (I'm comfortable getting things done in these languages, but am not an expert developer). 

 I think where I fall short is that (1) I lack experience in software development, particularly in a team environment (I have written plenty of software for my own research, and have published some of my code for general use, but have not worked on collaborative codes), (2)I have not done much web development, and (3) my breadth of experience with database languages and tools other than basic SQL is non-existent.

What steps should I take to get my foot in the door?  How hireable am I at the moment without a laundry-list of industry-specific skills, and what are the minimum steps I need to take to become hireable?

I was considering creating a data blog where I work on small projects that interest to me, with the code available on GitHub or similar.  I could use this as a way to build new skills and showcase my work to prospective employers.  Thoughts?  Or is there a better use of my time?  If you do think this is a good idea, what types of projects/analyses will be most impressive to prospective employers?

I have a high gpa, one data science related internship, and some research experience.

The position is at a non-profit, and through its contract does not have any stock/bonus/other compensation besides 401k matching and base salary. The base salary I'm being offered is $80,000. This seems strong to me, though looking at entry level salaries in the Boston area has me questioning that initial excitement.

Such companies must have lots of data and constantly need someone to build predictive models for them. I can't think of many companies that need full-time, in-house data scientists to build predictive models, which leads me to my next point: are the services of data-scientists really need full time, or are they more like free-lance consultants?  For example, I have a friend who works as a product analyst at a huge gaming company, but they don't care about data scientists because the gaming industry moves ""too fast"". 
Looking around on indeed.com, i found that there are very few data scientist positions (this is in SF bay area too) and when they do have positions, they usually want PhDs. 
The only companies I can think of that need data-scientists are huge companies that are super innovative, like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. This is because since they are so innovative, they need people in-house to build lots of predictive models for them from the huge amount of data that they have. They also want PhDs.

Conversely, the roles of ""BI Analyst, Business Analyst, Data analyst"" are far, far more common, since it seems like almost every company needs them. ",5,2

We study 'python' and its more data-science-driven version 'anaconda', but we have that awful course in which we study the SAS language. Its syntax is horrific, it's not intuitive, slow, expensive (we have a free version but cmon, and it costs me time and storage anyway, up to 12GB) and we end up realizing with fellow students that it would have taken us 3h to do better in anaconda something we did in 10h of SAS (not to mention the teacher)

At first I thought that there were secret mecanics specific to sas regarding model estimation, linear regression and so forth.. but as time passes I seriously doubt its usefulness. Our python teacher even confessed he does not know SAS because it's useless to him compared to R, but he's not really a data scientist to my knowledge so I don't know.

So for a bit of background, I originally did marketing at university and was working within marketing, but had a massive interest in analytics. I won't bore you with the details but a few months ago I successfully managed to transfer over to the analytics team in my company where I now work as a full time Data Analyst. I learnt Python and SQL through some online courses and recently completed a data science &amp; machine learning course on Udemy which has been really helpful. Whilst I am not a data scientist in my role, it is that path that I want to go down and as time passes there will be more and more elements of data scienece in my everyday responsibilities (for example I need to build a predictive model in the next few months as part of my objectives).

I am fairly comfortable with the coding aspect of the role, and the things that I don't know I usually figure out by reading around the internet and stackoverflow. However, I feel like there is a big gap in my background in terms of maths/stats and I really want to develop now to catch up with the rest of my team. I did some statistics as part of my course (binomial distributions, hypothesis testing) but I can barely remember it and I feel like it's only scratching the surface.

Is there anyone that could recommend some online courses or books for me to start building on this? Ideally I want to get the basic statistics down first, get comfortable with hypothesis testing and understanding how to prepare data well (feature selection, bias, etc), and then I'd imagine I need to develop on my linear algebra to fully understand the mathematics behind the models, correct?

I have a total of 74 columns, some of those are factors and some are numbers.

Exploring the dataset I've found that clients that have accepted the bank offer (1s), are mostly new clients, so their IDs are the most recents. Also the variable that counts the number of years that they've been on the bank is mostly low for the 1s.
I would like to use some classification algorithm like Bayesian Trees or Classification trees.

1)My first question is: is there a way to improve what algorithms will do on classifications? 
I was thinking about dividing those two variables in quantiles but I'm not sure if the two algorithm will already figure it out by themselves.

Another problem I'm having trouble is modelling the number of years the client had a bank count (again!): on my 40k observations it has 15k missings. It goes from 0 to 99, but looking at the data distribution I can see that nearly all the values are between 0 and a 40. My conclusion is that those 99 are some kind of missing or errors, here comes the second question:

2) What should I do to bring them into the range of the other variables? 
I was thinking about fitting a regression model on the other covariates then use it to predict their ""true"" variable.

The last problem that's making me think a lot regards the grouping of integers. I've seen that on some variables (some of which are really good on predicting my few 1s) I have a lot of values close to 0 and then they decrease till 400, with a lot of values from 30 till the end having just 1 on their absolute frequency. I was thinking about dividing them into classes and I wanted to know:

3) Is there an algorithm that is able to find the right number of classes I need to divide my variables in? Would that operation create benefits on my predictions? Is there an optimal way to also find the right length of my classes?

I have historical sales data by week for the last 2 years for all SKUs, and also have an average price for the week for each SKU for the same period.

I have been earlier using Holt Winters method that I had developed in excel that used to forecast without taking price into account and just using sales history and time periods (months) and that used to work reasonably well. I used to forecast the category total and then just applied manually the split per SKU based on judgement and history.

However, this time I need to incorporate price into the equation as the SKUs are price sensitive, and not only are they price elastic by themselves, the relative price between SKUs of the same category can cannibalize SKUs in the category that are slightly higher priced.

Is there a way that I can implement this forecast in any logical way? I only have Excel as a tool and nothing else, and I am someone who prefers a simple solution that gets me there 80% rather than a overly complex one that might get me to 100%.

If there is a way, please let me know. It would be appreciated.

I am an intern helping a company with data analysis, but I am running into a lot of issues. We have over a million data points that also have lat-long coordinates with them.

I want to reverse geocode the coordinates in order to get the zipcode for each piece of data - what would be the best way to do this? 

I was using R and tried using the reverse geocode method through Google, but that limits the amount of queries I can make a day, and, without paying, doing 2500 points a day for 1.4 million data points is going to take a really long time. 

I then found [this link](https://dmbeskow.github.io/Reverse-Geocode/) and attempted the fourth method he suggests. The fourth method requires downloading an excel doc (for the area the data was collected in) of zip codes (with coordinates), and then using a distance formula to find the closest coordinates between the two and matching a zipcode based on what is closest - however running the rdist.earth method requires 12,000gb of memory due to the amount of data, which makes that not an option.

Within R, I also have attempted making our data into a SpatialPointsDataFrame and overlaying it on a shapefile of zipcodes, or doing the point.in.poly function, but I always run into errors that I can't solve. I do not have any experience doing spatial analysis in R, which is my biggest barrier when working with the sp library.

I have tried switching to python, however I haven't used python before and a lot of the packages/advice I have found recommends using some other website's API to reverse geocode the data, which usually limits the amount of queries per day, even if you do pay.

Any help or advice someone can give? Maybe even pointing me to some tutorials that can help me out would be much appreciated. However, the large dataset still worries me because most functions will likely have trouble running on this many data points.",6,2

y= a(x)^n + b(x)^(n-1)+ ...+ and then performing numerical integration and subtracting the results to obtain the area. Is there a better way go about this? Is there a good package in R which might make these calculations a bit easier to perform?



Edit: I just realized this won't work. If my model can predict the number of calls with 100% accuracy, then the area under each curve is the same, i.e. the total call volume, and thus the difference is always 0.

I've found two open datasets and I'd like to use them to find the rate of accidents per 1000 km travelled on the most important segments of the province of Quebec, Canada.

The first dataset has the [car crashes reported to police in the Province of Quebec for years 2011-2016](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/fr/dataset/rapports-d-accident).    Here's the [doc](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/donnees-ouvertes/rapports-accident/rapports-accident-documentation.pdf)  The lat-long isnt available for location.  Instead, we have the following variables.  
  
* ""NO_CIVIQ_ACCDN"" , the street civic number  
* ""SFX_NO_CIVIQ_ACCDN"", a suffix to the street number  
* ""RUE_ACCDN"", the road name  
* ""CD_MUNCP"", the city code.    Here is a  [dictionnary to convert city code to name](https://www.mamrot.gouv.qc.ca/recherche-avancee/fiche/municipalite/).     

* ""NO_ROUTE"" is the road number where the accident happened (numbered roads are typically highways).   This seems to be used as a alternative to the road name RUE_ACCDN.  
* ""CD_PNT_CDRNL_ROUTE"" is the direction (North, South, East, West (Ouest) )  travelled on the road/highway.    
*   ""BORNE_KM_ACCDN"" is the milestone number (used on highways and northern gravel roads)   
  
  

They also use landmarks (intersection, etc..) to help locate the accident:
  
* TP_REPRR_ACCDN is the type of landmark.    
      * 1  means the intersection of two roads,    
      * 2 "" means ""other landmark""   
      * 0 means the type is not specified.     
* ""ACCDN_PRES_DE"" is the landmark that the type refers to.  It can be the road that intersects the road named under ""RUE_ACCDN"", a bridge, a school name, etc.  
* ""NB_METRE_DIST_ACCD"" is the distance in meters between the landmark and the accident.     
* ""CD_PNT_CDRNL_REPRR"" is the direction (North,South, East, Ouest) from the landmark to the accident.  
  
The second dataset is a shapefile, which contains the measured [traffic volumes](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/fr/dataset/debits-de-circulation-transports-quebec) for different road segments.   djma is the average yearly daily volume, djme is the average summer daily volume  and djmh is the average winter daily volume.  

I'd like to know geocode the car crashes so I can associate them to a road segment with a known traffic flow. many accidents happened on each road segments on a given year, then divide this by the  the average daily volume (djma) times the road segment length (?) to know how many accidents happened per 1000 kilometers travelled on that segment.   

Here is a [R script](https://github.com/SimonCoulombe/saaqmtq) where I imported and mapped the 
shapefile.  I've also imported the car crashes report, but I'm having a hard time 
geocoding it, with most markers ending outside my test city.

I was first exposed to the field of data science through an internship at a startup here in Lebanon called Lyngro in the summer of 2017. Despite knowing nothing about data analysis I wanted to throw myself at the subject even if it meant dealing with a huge amount of information overload.

After two month working with the team on developing a recommendation engine for Arabic news articles, I decided to sit down and try to document each step of the implementation process (research to code) to first, give back to the community that taught me everything I know, in the hopes of giving someone with similar zero experience an easier way to get started, and second, to keep a detailed record/portfolio of the project.

Keep in mind that this series was written by a beginner for beginners, so I'm sorry for any oversimplification of concepts and lack of an advanced mathematical background. Hence, the reason I wanted to post each new entry of my series here is to get as much feedback, tips, and new learning material as I can to try and advance my knowledge in the field.

In CS, new grad recruiting season is now. Firms are willing to hire that early to get dibs on the best talent. But, I'm coming to realize that all of the culture/structure around hiring like you can read in /r/CSCQ is really in its infancy for DS.

Does DS have a similar recruiting cycle to CS where all the big/selective/hyped firms hire around now for late spring start dates? Should I just be holding off on applying for anything until Q1 or Q2? When should I expect more new grad positions opening up?

After completion of above classes, I'd like to do a quantitative masters. Not sure what I'd like to focus on when that time comes however. I'm fully aware that this plan will take a while to hash out (5+ years realistically), and I'm prepared to put in the effort. For current data scientists, how does this plan stack up against how you broke into the data science field?

Although many US data science bootcamps seek to recruit STEM majors and scientists with PhDs, the online information supplied seems very vague on this, offering no guidance, especially with regard to visas. The only one offering specific guidance [Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html#apply), which offers this:

&gt; **Are international students eligible? What kind of visa do I need to attend?**

&gt; We accept international students for the program and encourage them to apply

&gt; However, we are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice. To the best of our understanding, you may participate in the program if you have a visa that grants work-authorization e.g. H-1B, TN, L-1B visas or F-1 students on Optional Practical Training (OPT), so long as the program is incidental to your status, or if you have any visa that allows you to be in the country to attend meetings, e.g. a visa status which allows for participation in professional seminars and/or non-academic, short course of study such as the B-1 visitor visa or the Visa Waiver Program. Please consult an immigration attorney for additional guidance. If you need an immigration attorney, consider using Adam Moses at Wildes Weinberg

From searching, I haven't found any suitable examples, such as. The nearest that I can find is a [Canadian citizen that did Insight Data Engineering](https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/191/programming/ask-me-about-going-data-bootcamp-1470295/) on a TN Visa, although he was an engineer beforehand.

And, as the Harvard Business Review notes,

Because the industry gives the ""Data Scientist"" title to people with differing levels of data-related skillsets, everything from generating reports to building machine learning models, comparing Data Scientist roles just by title or years of experience isn't enough--getting down to the comparison of skills and role is more useful. 

I've run into this while trying to collect more data about a Data Scientist's salary to use in future negotiations and understand my market value. My employer, like most I imagine, is pretty tight lipped about what others in my role make, and opaque about how they arrive at compensation numbers, so I hope this post helps us all a little.

I'd like to share that information with the community in the hopes that others will do the same, giving us all a bunch of data points where we can say to our employers ""I heard of Data Scientist X making Y doing Z in NYC"". Here it is, and thanks for everyone's participation!

* Location: NYC
* Title: Data Scientist
* Education level: Bachelors in Computer Science
* Industry/vertical: software-as-a-service tech company
* Company size: 500-1000
* Majority of time spent using (tools): Python, pandas, Spark, Jupyter Notebook, SQL
* Majority of time spent doing (role): writing ETLs, data analysis, reporting for A/B tests, communication to influence the product, building dashboards for monitoring metrics
* Compensation: $104k salary, some options, no bonus

Edit: Before making this post, I had already used Paysa, Glassdoor, Stackoverflow's Salary Tool, h1bdata.com, and O'Reilly's model/report to compare my salary. But I'm always looking for more data points, and this is a different kind of data that'll be helpful to the community!",150,115

Now the process is that we already have disposed of assets previously based on some cost measures and gut feeling factors.

Not yet a ton of directly-relevant items I can place on my resume. 

If I were applying for a research or engineering position, I would obviously want to include my research history, describe my expertise (experimental atomic physics), hard skills, list my publications and presentations, etc. My instinct is that these would largely be irrelevant/ignored on a DS resume (which, from what I can gather, is ideally just a single page). I was hoping to get some insight from folks here about which aspects of my physics career would be worth including on my resume. If anyone else has made a similar career transition and would like to chime in on their experience, that'd be awesome.",1,3

A little background: current M.S. in stats student, have taken probability/hypothesis testing, regression methods (linear multiple, nonlinear, logistic), and R/SAS programming. I'm currently taking theory and linear modeling. End goal is to work as a data scientist.

Next semester, I unfortunately only have one elective choice due to conflicts so my adviser pointed me towards a possible CS course I can take. Unfortunately I'm not sure if it's worth foregoing my statistics elective to take the CS class. The descriptions are below:

* (Stats) : Categorical Data Analysis - Estimation, maximum likelihood, weighted least squares, log-linear models, logistic regression

* (CS) : Data Mining and Database Programming - Theory and practice of information management including PL/SQL; object and object-relational databases; data warehousing; data mining. 

I know being an expert in SQL is very important in DS as nearly ever single job posting I've seen required it, and I am currently a novice at the language as I use basic SQL queries (Oracle) at work to pull in data. I'm just afraid of the possibility that if I forego that statistics course, that somewhere down the line I might need to know the theory and applications of categorical data analysis for data science or other statistical jobs.

Hello my dear colleagues, I hope you can help with my current situation, or at least give me some guidance. Much much appreciated.



I've recently started my first job as a Data Scientist. The days prior to starting the job were great. Reading, learning, thinking about what I was going to do. Awesome. Wonderful. I was told there was a clustering phase, and intentions to create a churn model. But then it started. 





My colleague (boss, who had no experience in Data Science until this February and knows absolutely zero SQL(!)) and I were sent to a new client on Monday. It's an Insurance company (car, home, etc) and they had no analytics team whatsoever. We're supposed to do a clustering project (don't really know the goal of the this yet). 





**My problem is the following:** Their database is something along the lines of 2000 tables. There's no documentation about the database, explaining where the info about invoice, plans, info about customers, etc , is. We know of some tables but the names of the fields are just..It's not enough. 





My boss's idea was to download all the tables and load them in R (cause he doesn't know SQL) and get rid of the columns that do not have a lot of information. I insisted that this is not doable (*stupid*) and asked that he let me work in SQL instead, so now I'm a bit on my own, trying to get something out of the db.





Basically he was expecting to go to this client and a data.frame kinda of information to work on. He says he doesn't like to work with split data. Me neither, but this is not Kaggle.





**My question is:** How do you guys do, when going to a new job and a new client, how do you get familiar with a database with thousands of tables, thousands of columns with unclear names? 







I suggested to first plan what the ""data.frame"" that we want to work with looks like and get that information from SQL progressively, but my boss says that we don't know what data is important that way and is determined to download all the tables to his computer, and check one by one in R. I've given up on this route. I need help. What should I do. I don't know how to approach a new database because there's just too many tables and don't know where to get the information. 





:( 

I've thought about quitting and looking for a better job. I had no idea this was going to happen. I thought by the interview he was experienced. Only on Monday I knew he was hired to manage the new ""predictive analytics"" team in my company but he didn't know what data science was, and he still doesn't know anything about SQL or databases. I was expecting to learn and evolve in my first job. I just feel so lost :( 



What should I do? 

(I'm 26, Msc in mathematics(statistics), proficient in sql and r, basic python, living in a country with not many DS opportunities. Portugal.)

Summary: I'm currently a 'Software Engineer' at a mid-sized company on the data team. I handle ETL and architecture for projects that handle anywhere from 5 TB to hundreds of TB ingested per day. My day-to-day tools are Scala, Python, SQL, Spark, and Hadoop ecosystem relational/non-relational databases (HBase, HDFS, Redshift, Hive). In my graduate studies I took pretty heavy quant focused courses: stochastic calculus, options/future, portfolio analysis, derivatives, and some others. The classes relied heavily on probability theory, statistics, calculus, and linear algebra with R/Python/MATLAB. Definitely not straight up machine learning, but I have spent some time learning it for myself and in previous jobs have been a part of building ML models/pipelines (for a minor work project. Hopefully I can leverage my engineering chops in a field where it is lacking (anecdotally based on my experience working with data scientists at several companies, some cringe-worthy scripts punted over the wall to engineering).

I currently work as a data analyst at a large tech firm. I graduated 2.5 years ago with a BS in Applied Mathematics (with a few extra statistics courses) and a minor in Computer Science. I want to increase my skill set (in particular, handling big data sets and application of statistical modeling) to become a data scientist. Since 88% of all data scientists have at least a masters degree (and 46% have a PhD)^[1](http://www.burtchworks.com/2014/11/17/must-have-skills-to-become-a-data-scientist/), I know this will be necessary to achieve my goals. I want practical, hands-on experience so I can jump into a role and immediately apply learned methods. I am not particularly interested in too much theory or research at this point, so I am interested in shorter, more practical Applied Statistics Masters degrees over the typical MS in Statistics. 

The Masters of Applied Statistics program at Colorado State University has caught my eye. It has been around for five years (compared to UCLA's in its first year) and I would plan to attend full-time, on-campus for the 11-month program. I reached out to the director of the program for a list of careers graduates pursue and her list of 10ish jobs were almost all statistician at various companies. [Here](http://mas.colostate.edu/oncampus/) is the curriculum. For the lazy, here is the list of classes: 

* Three-week review course: Mathematical Tools for Statistics
* Three-week review course: Computing Tools for Statistics
* Probability with Applications
* Mathematical Statistics with Applications
* Experimental Design
* Mixed Models
* Regression Models and Applications
* Generalized Regression Models
* Applied Bayesian Statistics
* Methods in Multivariate Analysis
* Non-parametric Methods
* Analysis of Time Series
* Survey Statistics
* Statistical Learning and Data Mining
* Computational and Graphical Statistics
* Methods in Simulation and Computation
* Quantitative Reasoning
* Topics in Industrial and Organizational Statistics
* End with a six-week group consulting project 

**Do these classes seem like they would prepare me for applying to data scientist jobs?** I am concerned that there is no machine learning class listed. It looks like they offer a graduate-level computer science course that covers it. I may try to audit that class, or if anyone has online resources for self-teaching, I'd love to hear them! 

My plan after finishing the program is to either stay in Colorado or move to Los Angeles where my family lives. Either way, I would like to find a job that pays at least $100k. 

So, does this seem like a good plan? Should I go for a MS in Statistics instead? Help a fellow math lover out :)

I'm currently in the process of changing career from academic philosopher to data scientist. Having done a PhD and published in philosophy, I feel that I have excellent 'soft skills' and the ability to learn new concepts very quickly, as well as ask the 'right' questions. Techwise, most of my coding experience comes from writing Google Docs Add-ons (e.g. one called Cross Reference), but what I have done is fairly advanced for that limited medium and has involved solving (relatively) difficult coding problems.

I am completing the 'Data Science with Python' course on DataCamp and finding Python relatively easy (not *that* different from JavaScript). I am also learning statistics from textbooks and Tableau/Gretl from a Udemy course on DataScience.

My hope is to apply for a job by the beginning of June 2018. So my question is: how would my time best be spent between now and then to help me get into the best role that I can?

- Should I dedicate more time to stats or coding?

- I have been told to take on a data science project and document it online, but should I focus on some unexplored data that need a good clean up, or should I take an established dataset and do something analogous to other people's projects? How should I document a project such that an employer might see it? Can I put such 'hobby' projects on my CV?

- Is it realistic to expect to get anything above the entry level data analyst roles?

I am curious about data scientists in large consulting firms, e.g. in the McKinsey Solutions, BCG Gamma, Bain analytics type groups. I am considering applying for these kind of positions, it seems like it would be a good way to get exposed to a variety of problems and industries. I have a physics PhD background, and a lot of my former colleagues end up in either consulting or data science so this seems like it might be a pretty good mix between these options.

But at the same time I wonder how much ""data science"" these firms actually do, or if it is essentially glorified excel coding and second class consulting work. Does anyone have any experience in this sector? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I'm a MS Database admin and BI guy working in local govt, theres only 1 of me in IT and Im responsible for all things ""data"". I'm always reporting on KPIs and operational type reports and I want to do more. Now with Microsoft R in SQL server it seems like a good time to start learning things like Demand forecasting but relying more on SQL.


Anyway boss is on holiday and my are projects up to date - I had 3 weeks of learning R and trying to come up with a model that would predict the next 36 months of Services requests (stuff like burst water pipe, roaming dog, pot hole).


After finding a good YouTube video, I made a table that contained Type of request, Actual year and month, a summed count of the month, target year and month to predict, 60 months of lag counts, and 10 years lags. I set months and types to be factors in R.


Linear regression (rxLinMod) came back best, the train and test sets had a coefficient of determination around 93%. I tried BTrees (rxBTrees) and Decision forest (rxDForest) but they werent as good.


Cool, I thought lets make it better. I built a table containing population count actuals and forecasts for our district and added actual population, 10 years population lag and 5 years population lead to the formula. 

The training set came back at 96% but the test set came back at 70%. Even with just the actual population and the lead/lag population columns removed the test set came back at 89%. 


Why are the results so different from the test set to the training set? I thought population would have a high correlation with the number of request raised.

Also as far as best practice goes should I be doing separate models for each Type?

Any recommendations on what to try next? Ive just stuck to the default packages in Rstudio (but then my ComputeContext is the SQL server, no idea if they share packages.)

Below is my profile, which the format is identical to the original post, with an added field for experience.

**Location**: London, UK

**Title**: Data Scientist

**Education level**: BSc in Statistics, MSc in Analytics

**Experience**: Two years, Medium-level

**Industry/vertical**: Travel / BI

**Company size**: 1000+

**Majority of time spent doing (role)**: Dashboard building, light-to-mid-weight statistical modelling, automation (building notification system), building internal data products

**Compensation**: 44k + negligible bonus

Very similar to OP, my role slightly deviates from the typical stereotype of a Data Scientist and has a strong flavour in analytics. I find it right in the mid road between a Data Engineer and a Data Scientist which I am not certain whether will be a good thing or not in the long run.

While open to questions, I would really appreciate if we can focus on sharing information and avoid trenching too far, for example, initiating arguments about what constitutes as a true data scientist and so on.",23,15

I'm currently working in InfoSec, and I wanted to know if my skillset could eventually be used for a reconversion in this field (To be honest it looks fun). From what I could see it looks quite close. But between the impression I got and the reality of the job there is chasm.

Basically my job involves parsing and probing lots of logs, find the proverbial needle in the haystack and get back to the source of the issue to fix it. Either manually by looking for weird patterns or automatically via scripted alerts etc. I'm to the IT what the plumber is to your kitchen.

My mind is wired to think in terms of patterns. I don't know how well this translates with real world data but most of the time IT is a really predictable environnement. Things happen for a reason, are reproducible most of the time and fall cleanly into algorithm-shaped cases.

To do this I need to automatize a lot of tasks as the sheer volume would drown me otherwise. Which implies skills in programming. BUT I AM NOT a developper. I know my limits, my jobs are more on the fly hacks and quick&amp;dirty scripts. Plus sprinkles of python magic to translate those into readable databases.

I have a mathematical background but more physics oriented really - especially signal processing. I know of statistics (statistical results do not faze me when reading papers) but I don't know them well. Nor am I using them day to day, used R only a couple of times for fun - that's it. If you know of French ecoles preparatoires system it might give you and idea of my math background.

As you might imagine, IT needs are a bit obscure to the layman, ITSec even more so. Especially as I have to present things and argue to spend money *before* things happen. Thus I am used to translating jargon into human speech.

My experience which was the closest to what I think is datascience was my last year of engineering school in my internship. I spent 6 months writing a script benchmarking networking cards for a data center. The script runned automatized tests under several configurations I had to create to simulate all the use cases. Then compiled the data, made graphs etc. I had to tweak it several time to answer needs of a couple other teams that got interested in the project. But it was a big ugly mess in the end. Even though it did the job.


So, thoughts?
Do you think it could work?
If no what skill do I absolutely need?

Thanks for your time and answers.

I was thining of using a bayes network?  Never done one before.  Seems like it would use the relationship between our products to help score how likely a customer is to buy a product. I would just use the cummalitive probability as the lead score.

Would this work? Bad idea? better alternatives?

I am taking the CCA131 administrator exam. I find many videos scattered online (low quality youtube) but I do not seem to find any official study material. The website seems to describe the required skills to take the test, but what is the recommended educational material? Do online courses exist? The closest I get is

1) a book: https://www.amazon.com/CCA131-Administration-Certification-Hands-Certifications-ebook/dp/B074M65FXS/... and

2) a pdf from the cloudera forum's website:

I want to make a good one that is problem/solution domain based.  Do I have this right for my top level nodes?  Here is where I am headed so far: https://imgur.com/gallery/CugcS

My questions/doubts about what I have so far are:

&amp;nbsp;

- Is my starting point below generally correct?  e.g. no high level subclass is missing, and everything presented as a subclass deserves to be here?

- is Hybrid learning always just a combination of supervised and unsupervised?  Or, are there real examples of other hybrid models (e.g. 'reinforcement' and 'supervised', etc.).  I know _theoretically_ we can combine any methods...I'm looking for what's real/applied/demonstrable today.

- does Reinforcement learning belong at this high level, or is it actually a subset of one of the others (or one I've omitted)?  

&amp;nbsp;

1. Machine Learning

    1.1 Supervised (uses labelled data to train and validate)

    1.2 Unsupervised (uses unlabeled data, or ignores labels if they are present)

    1.3 Semi-supervised (uses partially labelled (mostly unlabeled) data)

    1.4 Hybrid (combines a supervised method and an unsupervised method)

    1.5 Reinforcement Learning (uses data from the environment)

Internally we have very few individuals that know / use machine learning methods, me being one of them.

The VP overseeing the construction of this team is very interested in recruiting me for the team as he knows I have data science skills, and I've also worked with him directly using machine learning to  solve a business problem.

Part of my concern is I'm not sure I'm ready. I was encouraged to apply to a manager position they opened with the team which would likely operate as an individual contributor for some time. I'm confident I can use R to handle most problem sets that come up, but am still working my way through learning python. Additionally, I've never used Spark/Hadoop/AWS (their data structure) and my SQL is pretty rusty. On top of this I'd really like to get more statistical methods under my belt so I'm not limited or at least know where to look to learn more to solve certain officer problems.

The upside is I'm a very quick study, and the position itself will likely not require highly advanced techniques for a while. There are some NLP problems that will come up and I don't have any experience with those, but I understand the approach and how the methods work conceptually.

I'm sure this all reads as a bit like imposter syndrome, but I feel conflicted that I might get this position and fail because I still have areas I would like to grow in before I'd feel very confident calling myself a ""data scientist"".

Can anyone else relate, or have similar stories? Any thoughts, advice, or words of encouragement?

Im currently a senior (undergrad) studying economics/finance/accounting (basically business) and I recently got intrigued by Data Analytics. With that being said, I do not have a technical background (such as Computer Science) but wanted a career that encompasses business and data analysis together. 

After some due diligence, I was wondering what the difference between Data Science/ Data Analytics/ Business Analytics/ BI/ ML is.

Also is there any computer skills I should learn ASAP to make me more appealing? Right now I'm quite strong in Excel and I'm Learning R and SQL. I hear a lot about Qik, Tableau, and SAS but since I'm still in school, working part-time and recruiting my time has been very limited.

And will I be able to break in fresh out of undergrad into a level-entry job or should I do boot camps or masters? 

Any advice would help; I'm fairly new to this.

625,2017-10-31,2017,10,31,21,79vd3m,Chi-square test for dependent data or different significance test?,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/79vd3m/chisquare_test_for_dependent_data_or_different/,nickanderson15,1509452629,"Hello everyone,
I have a question about what significance test I should use if want to compare two categorical variables within the same group/people.

For example, say I ask teachers to rate their students in terms of certain problem behaviors when students are in classroom or in the cafeteria. I could set up a 2x2 table, with environment as one variable (classroom or cafeteria) and whether they showed signs of a problem behavior, like being too loud/noisy. My problem is how to approach this analysis, because in the 2x2 table the same students are being used in the classroom and cafeteria settings. In other words, the assumption of independent observations is broken for the standard chi-square test.

In short, I am trying to figure out which significance test to use when I cannot use the chi-square because the groups I am comparing are the same people. I cannot use a paired/dependent t-test because I am trying to compare the incidence of behavior and not some continuous measure.

Question 2: The odds ratio would be the correct effect size measure to use here?",6,3

I'm interested in understanding the best approach to trying to predict a given users step count for an upcoming week.

The formulation of this problem is pretty familiar I imagine, with comparisons to predicting customer spend with a company or predicting usage of a product, however i'm just trying to understand the best approach to take.



I'm thinking most predictive modelling algorithms might be appropriate but I feel like without some creative feature engineering I won't get particularly great results.

It's safe to say I'd have access to a given users step history and probably would be able to source other features about users too.",4,5
