To be closer to family, we're looking at either Denver, CO or Austin, TX.

The past three months I've been interviewing for data scientist positions and I thought I would share my results since posts like this have been popular in the past.

##Background:
I am finishing up a mathematics PhD. Around the time I was finishing my thesis (in algebraic geometry, completely pure math), about a year ago, I decided to focus entirely on a career in industry, and have been taking advantage of my student status taking graduate CS and stats courses at my university in preparation, as well as taking an ML internship this past summer.

Thus, I'm fairly similar to what seems like a large contingent in this sub: technical background trying to break into data science. Fortunately I had some programming experience already to make this an easier transition.

My resume reads something like:  
Education:  
PhD Mathematics, Decent University  
Additional coursework in Statistics and Computer Science  
BS Mathematics, minor Physics, Less Decent University  

Experience:  
Mathematics TA/Instructor, 5 years

Researcher, Government Lab, 3 months (last summer)  
Applying stats/ML to large data sets using Python, R, C++, SQL

Programmer, Government Lab, 8 months (during undergrad)  
Writing GUIs for controlling a large scientific measurement device, in C

Programmer, Government Lab, 6 months (during undergrad)  
Using unsupervised learning to analyze medical data, in C

Languages/tools: Python, R, C++, C, SQL, D3.js, Tableau, CUDA, Matlab

## Process
This past September I began applying, telling companies I could graduate in December as long as I heard back before November 30th and could my defense set up and such. I intended to continue at my university for another quarter if I didn't find anything.

In general the process is thus: first, a phone call with the recruiter talking generally about the position, my background, and gauging my interest.

Next, 1-3 technical screens, half focusing on programming and the other half on data science.

The programming half is on something like collabedit, and generally has a few questions for you to code up in python. These range from ""merge two sorted lists"" and ""compute the fibonacci numbers"" to ""write a routine to preprocess text files, code to train a naive bayes classifier, and predict using that code (not call a library, write the whole thing)"". I recommend checking out a site like HackerRank (for the problems, not the contests), which have a range of problem difficulties. Practice talking through your thought process too.

The data science half has some basic stats questions and generally talking through how you would solve a ML problem from start to finish. For instance, one time I had to talk through how I would set up Zillow's Zestimate from what data I would use, what model, how I would train it over a large set, verify results, keep it updated, diagnose problems, etc.

Then there's the on-site, which is similar to the screens above but more focused on the actual company and role, more difficult, and much longer.

## The Numbers

I ended up applying to 39 companies, all in the Seattle area (part of my motivation for industry was that I could stay in Seattle). Of those, I got interest from 11, but only 7 were willing to get through the process before my deadline. Of those, I withdrew my application after the first screen for 1, was rejected after a screen for a second, withdrew before the scheduled on-site for another, and thus had 4 on-site interviews.

For one, they initially accepted while saying they would provide a 6 week training program since my background wasn't strong enough. Eventually they reneged and said to hold off for a few months. I had concerns for the work/life balance there, so this didn't worry me that much.

For another, I was rejected after the on-site. Oh well.

The last two I got offers from, and decided to take one.

I've anonymized the companies and uniformized the job titles somewhat (there are many equivalent titles to data scientist (quantitative analyst, machine learning scientist, statistical analyst, research engineer...)), but the dates and offers are real. SDE = any software role, DS = data scientist or equivalent, RS = research scientist (large overlap with DS but sometimes focused on a particular topic like NLP or computer vision).

To be very clear (I hope) I'm not trying to stalk individual posters, I'm looking for correlations (in aggregate) to other subs, for those that might post on a particular sub.

To give a totally unrelated example, somebody might suspect that there is some correlation for those that post on a Nascar sub, to those that post on a NFL sub, etc.

Hi, 

I'm looking for a volunteer position to gain experience in data science. I've been teaching myself data science for the past few months, taking online classes (Udactiy, Coursera, edX), and doing personal project. But I feel that I lack the connections needed to land a data science job (I've started going to MeetUps to help get some connections). 

I know similar topics have been posted in the past. And I'm aware of places in the US such as [DataKind*](http://www.datakind.org) and [SumAll](http://www.sumall.org). But is anyone aware of nonprofits in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) that needs volunteers for data science projects? I'm totally ok just doing ""data monkeying"" work, where I do junior data science work ([like what's described in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3l128r/serious_question_how_do_i_hire_junior_data/?)).


Anyone help or insight would be great

My question is related to the fact that I have yet to pay for a coursera course. I'm foggy on the benefits of paying for the course when you can get the knowledge for free. Is the certificate really necessary? From the FAQ on Coursera, it sounds like when you complete a course, you get a confirmation that you have and it stays on your coursera profile, but the only thing you miss out on is the signed certificate and LinkedIn badges. 

Is it important to have the certificate? Do employers value something like this? Am I in danger if I list my coursework on my resume of being unable to verify it and losing an offer? 

I'm curious if anyone else has had experience with paying for the certificate and what their thoughts were.

Thanks!

I'm slowly advancing my knowledge and understanding of how to apply data science to real life problems and I would like to ask you for help in creating a checklist on how to approach a data science problem. Here is a checklist I created so far.

0. What exactly is the business value in modeling these data?  

1. Formulate a problem or question that needs answer.  
a) Is this a Machine Learning problem, a statistics question or something else?  
b) think how to measure results

2. Create a work space, get access to data.

3. Explore Data  
a) try to get a grasp on what dataset looks like, what are the dimensions  
b) clean the data  
c) validate the data  
d) look for outliers - keep them in mind

4. Create additional variables, if possible ask field expert for insight. The reason I like to do it before constructing any models is to not be biased by any results I get from first model approach.

5. Construct first quick and dirty model.  
a) look at model performance (good? bad?)  
b) look at most significant variables (visual pair plots, distributions, outliers)  
c) try to create additional variables in form of log(x), x1 + x2, x1 - x2, x1/x2, x1 * x2 etc

6. Run cross validation to tune the model parameters  
a) look how model performs without outliers  
b) look how different ways of treating missing values affect model performance.  
c) look at cases where the error is the biggest

7. Repeat previous 2 steps using different algorithms, look what works, what doesn't.

8. Try to combine results from different models.

9. Try to cluster the data and run models on subsets.

10. Hit a brick wall

I am working on a fraud detection system. I have two problems :

I am not interested in identifying 1 case of fraud which would be harmless to the business. My goal is to be able to identify if, say, 100 new users are fraudsters especially if the fraud has the same underlying pattern.

I was thinking of the following test :

- calculate the probability for each new user to see him based on the observed proportions in my database;
- after a week, select the most unusual percentile of new users; 
- calculate the likelihood of getting such a set of unusual user; 
- trigger an alert if this likelihood is too low.

Is it a viable and interesting approach ? Does it sounds like an existing technique that I do not know about already implemented in an R package ? 

For example : 
  Say my only predictor is email provider. 
I can observe the following proportions in my database :
  gmail : 50% of users
hotmail : 49.9% of users
foomail : 0.01% of users

On a given week I have 1000 new users and 100 of them have foomail as an email provider, that is unusual, the system triggers an alert and a human investigate what is going on.

I'm starting to play around with D3.js for data visualizations, more specifically using animated Bubble/Scatter charts to compare data to draw attention to any anomalies (similar to http://www.gapminder.org/world).

Working with my data, I had been comparing:  
        Sum(TravelTime) (x-xis) vs Sum(TravelDistance) (y-axis)   
...for multiple vehicles and multiple destinations (so for a given day, there is a bubble for each destination, and the xy intersection value is the sum of all trips to that destination).  After looking at this it seemed that this was kind of a nonsensical visualization, as longer trips would naturally take longer time, so the bubbles would tend to form a line, whereas what I was wanting was them to be grouped together, so I changed the visualization to:  
    Sum(TravelTime) (x-xis) vs Sum(TravelDistance)/Sum(TravelTime) (y-axis)  

...which seemed to result in a visualization that made more sense. 

I think this falls short of ""data science"", but despite that, is there a proper term to refer to what ""this"" type of analysis is, and does anyone know any books or other resources one could refer to to get up to speed on various techniques so I'm not learning everything from trial and error?

I am in my second semester of grad school, getting my MS in Operations Research, concentrating in data science/analytics. 

So this company actually contacted me about their internship via my resume on either LinkedIn, Indeed, or my school's career site; I did not apply or contact them initially. Their glassdoor review seems a little questionable as of recently due to a lot of rough reviews this past month about their management team (it's a very fast growing 2 year old startup), and I was additionally little skeptical considering they contacted me...but I thought it wouldn't hurt to do a phone interview at least. A few questions for you guys:

What is a ""good"" offer or compensation for a summer internship? This company in particular seems to pay its data scientists ~90k. Also, they said they don't have any positions open at the moment, should I care about that? They are local (research triangle), so that is nice.

Did any of you all get internship/job offers from places you never contacted or applied to?

I have yet to have the chance to really apply to anything else, and have never been offered an internship so I don't know the procedures...should I scoop it up if they say end up wanting me, or try my luck at some other places first? Do places often give you some time to decide? 

Also, any tips regarding interviews with this field specifically in mind would be great. I generally am pretty confident and comfortable in interviews, but all tips are appreciated! 

Thanks!!!

I am looking to make a raking of movies from a specific subset of data. I am going to use IMDB ratings as my input data.

How would I go about making a bayesian ranking of these movies?

The formula IMDB uses is: weighted rank (WR) = (v  (v+m))  R + (m  (v+m))  C

 where:
  R = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating)
  v = number of votes for the movie = (votes)
  m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 1250)
  C = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.8)

The issue is that I have no idea what the minimum would/should be. Because I'm measuring a subset of data with huge variation in the number of ratings, I have no idea what to put there.

Any suggestions or advice?

And yes - a thoughtful Reddit user informed me I left off the ""S"" on Johns in the title. Amended below though :-) .

I've been work as a platform dev for approx 18 months writing a blend of Python and Java code. Most of my work focuses on picking up data from third party APIs, sticking it into our data pipeline, and pulling it out with Python to serve up for our web app after it's been fed into the various MapReduce jobs we have to format the data into the shape we need. 

What do I want to do in the future?

I want to understand how to build models to derive insights from data, knowing how to clean it, work with data at scale, identify holes in data sets, and essentially work efficiently with data. With a background in social science research I'm inclined towards working in a space where non-profit meets data, but I'm comfortable working within the more traditional technical space provided it's within the realms of ""data engineering"" (as I understand it).

What I'm trying to do -

Outside of networking, finding folks in the community who do work I may be interested in, I want to pursue learning to help fill in the gaps. I may (mostly likely) invest in another grad program down the line once I've defined my career goals more specifically. MOOC therefore provide an attractive option for me.

Johns Hopkins Data Sci specialization and the UCSD Big Data specialization are two course listings that pop out to me. It appears to me the former may be more academically minded whereas the latter is more professional minded. True or not, I'm at a crossroads as to which one to pursue. 

I have a strong background in Python and have worked in R - not caring for it entirely. The JH track is R only and most reviews say the content is quite introductory at best. 

Does anyone have any insight for what may be better? I'm not looking to move into the academic space but wish to use the specialization to help me in professional development.",19,5,False,self,,,,,

I am a PhD chemist with about a year left on my current post-doc and I'm finding the idea of switching fields and moving into industry as a data scientist particularly appealing. Besides the fact that I thoroughly enjoy the data analysis of my work, a big reason i'm switching is to have more freedom in *where* I want to live and work.  Research fields tend to be ""go where the job is and only 5 places do that reserach, tough nuggets"" where as there are a data analyst/scientist positions open in every region of the country.  Anyway, I have a fairly diverse background including...

* B.S. in physics (omg maths)

* published undergrad work in computational chemistry (I still have nightmares of the fortran legacy code)

* PhD work in more fundamental chemistry (I know how to plan and research independently as well as present my work coherently)

* Post-doc work in more applied topics working with a team of engineers. (I can work in a group setting and have experience structuring my research around consumer demands)

* Picked up beginner to intermediate levels of fortran, c++, java, matlab at one point or another over the years

* Used to manipulating, organizing, and mining data relatively good sized data sets (100k+ rows) and correlating/interpreting that data for use by others.

I guess I'm wondering what would be the best route toward entering the data science field?  While I feel like I have plenty of experience handling and using data, I do seem to lack a lot of the specific technical skills that a lot of job postings are asking for (R, SQL, &lt;insert 20 different other packages/languages/programs i've barely heard of&gt;).  I'm worried that if I apply to lower level data analyst jobs in order to pick up the technical experience that I'll be bounced for the PhD (a lot of the analyst jobs seem to be for BS or MS) but if I apply for full data scientist positions I'll get bounced for not having enough experience with the industry specific languages and software.

So yeah.  Has anyone else here made this kind of jump? Am I crazy for wanting to switch?  Any basic advice?",14,5,False,self,,,,,

I am a professional with supply chain management experience (no data science experience unfortunately), and I work for a medium-size distribution company. Our ERP system is very old and we won't be moving to another ERP system (probably SAP) for another 4-5 years. So until then, I volunteered to lead a project on ""warehouse optimization""(something we desperately need). I've boiled the problem down to two parts:

The first part is an ""order picking problem"".. determining the shortest route through a warehouse while touching each point once. There are several examples of the similar ""traveling salesmen"" problem being resolved online (in R, with algorithms), which I have been exploring to learn more about the problem. Basically, I have CADs of warehouses (in pdf form) and need to figure out how to establish data points on the pdf or transpose it into a different form, then be able to determine why one layout is better than another (with metrics preferably).

The second part is an ""inventory slotting"" optimization problem.. determining the best location to place inventory out of different bins. I don't have many leads on this yet. I'm thinking considering it as a classification or clustering problem. Maybe involving a weighted scale based off different variables.. not sure yet. 
 
I have 7 months to develop an automatic or semi-automatic solution and a mandate to minimize project-related expenditures. The project doesn't have to be state of the art or optimal.. just needs to be functional. I've been told I could simply generate a static report, but I know the internal user needs visuals or they won't use it. 

Basically, I am contacting you guys for any advice
 on data analysis-related resources or techniques for problems like this (preferably open source options). I've been looking into techniques to solve this using R or Shiny. I've also been reading Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie and Tibshirani for potential direction. I'm willing to learn whatever I need to learn to accomplish this problem, and I have access to all the data in the system and someone provide it in a neat and clean form. If you guys have any advice on tools I can use, resources I can use, potential approaches to this problem.. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I'm a young, starry eyed data geek trying to have some fun and learn a little bit from a Super Smash Bros. Melee data set I got my hands on. Probably about 400,000 games worth of competitive play.

My goal is to compare the actual results to the community voted [""Tier List""](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Tier_list#Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_tier_list) for character power, as well as the [match-up heatmap](http://puu.sh/lVeuV/71b3ed2919.png).


My initial approach was a rudimentary combination of chess Elo ratings, and baseball's Log5 win percentage formulas... but that didn't work too well so I scrapped the Elo part and decided to keep it simple for now.

The general thought behind this was that in Smash Bros, each unique character can be thought of as a ""team,"" and the individual players only ever match up 1-on-1 against a player from another ""team.""

So my first approach was to isolate individual players. I created a new  column joining each player's ID with the corresponding character they played in each game. So each player would wind up with a unique ID for each character they'be played:

- 1_Falco
- 1_Pikachu
- 2_Fox
- 2_Marth
- 2_Sheik...

Then I pivoted on that new ID, to get win and loss counts, and get each player a raw win percentage. Filtering out players without at least 25 games worth of sample.

So now, for each individual game, I had a loose ""Win Probability"" for Player 1 and Player 2.

I used [Log5](http://www.hardballtimes.com/tools-game-and-series-win-probabilities/) to compare those two percentages, and get a game-specific win probability for each player.

Now, I'm stuck. I'm not sure how to properly normalize each character's raw win percentage based on the average win probability of their constituent players.

Ideas I had were:

- In an ideal scenario, the Log5 win probability for each player would be 50%. In this ideal match scenario, the winning player would get a score of 1. The greater the difference between the Log5 win probabilities, the lower the ""win quality."" Adjust the score proportionally to the difference. (Not sure how to do this in practice, some sort of ratio deal.)

- Create a pivot table by character, average the Log5 Win\Loss probabilities, and then use those to calculate an ""expected"" vs ""actual"" win\loss ratio. Use that ratio to normalize character win ratios. (Also no idea how to do the actual normalizing)

- Pivot to get win percentages for each individual character match-up. (26 x 26 = 676. Subtract the 26 ditto match-ups for an even 650.) Look at how each character performs against one-another, before adjusting for skill. This one is the most fuzzy, but potentially the most valid, because I can incorporate each character's performance as well as character usage. 

I feel like I'm close, but since I'm mostly self-taught when it comes to stats and data work, the correct implementation doesn't come to me intuitively. Any help would be appreciated.

If and when I were to graduate with a PhD, I am not necessarily interested in limiting myself to a job in academia. I currently work in science policy for the federal government, where I have been a *de facto* data analyst, which has piqued my interest in data science down the road. 

It seems like my PhD would likely come from a Biology or Evolutionary Biology department. I know looking at current data scientist job calls, they usually ask for advanced degrees in ""computer science, mathematics, statistics or related fields."" On the other hand, my current roommate works at a prominent data-heavy start up and I know their data scientists have advanced degrees from a pretty broad range of fields--psychology, linguistics, and economics, to name a few.

How important is the title of your PhD (i.e., the department) and what are best ways to ensure you are still a viable candidate for data science positions if your degree is not from the typical computer science/math/stats department? I am also unfamiliar with the general practices of ""naming"" your PhD. If I were to do research in mathematical biology within the evolutionary biology department, is it okay to list ""PhD Mathematical Biology"" on my cv/resume or does it need to stay as ""PhD Evolutionary Biology""?

side note: I anticipate that I will continue coding in graduate school and also anticipate doing a thesis with a heavy mathematical/computational component. I suppose I am more worried about being filtered out simply because on paper it seems I am not from a relevant field. ",8,3,False,self,,,,,

The issue is that I hold a degree in Architecture and unfortunately that wont get me very far in the field. Ive explored a few routes and the best option for me seems to be obtaining a Masters in Data Science, Data Analytics, or Business Analytics. Saying that, Im not too excited to be running into further student debt and Im looking for any way to lessen that impact. It isnt atypical for a Masters program to rack up over 60k of tuition in just 1-2 years of study as Im sure many of you are more than aware.

One option that has come to my attention is educational assistance offered through my current work. The main caveat to it is that the education must be related to the Associates current job duties or some attributable gain for the company. To clarify, my current role is Project Manager in an interior design and manufacturing company. We work within an ERP system called Epicor 9, which is largely how I obtained my interest in data. Ive also been exposed and leveraged tools such as data migration though ultimately this is not part of my job description and our ERP system is really only one database.
So my question is, how do I pitch that my obtaining of a Masters in Data Science would assist my contribution to the company and/or current role (PM)? What little I know has seemed to give me an edge in the work place but Im not confident that would be enough to warrant financial assistance that could be more than my yearly salary.

It isnt my intent to stay in this role so my pitch today would be something along the lines of while these skills are not used excessively in my current role, as the company and myself grow these are skills that could prove vital in moving our company towards success.

I'm looking to create a blog on Data Science and trying to assess what people want to learn or know -- but perhaps have not found a good resource. 

Some ideas include:

* Assessing new software (e.g. if you're a data analytics manager, do you hire more data scientists or bring on a product like KNIME, RapidMiner, DataRobot, Trifacta, etc.)

* Programming walkthroughs from start to finish (e.g. how to scrape a website, clean the data, perform sentiment analysis, etc.)

* How to break into data science (focus on what programming skills, statistics skills, and communication skills are necessary to get in AND be successful)

* [Let me know what you're interested in here]


Also, if you don't mind, would you let me know you're level of expertise (1 being absolute beginner/never touched and 10 being expert) and knowledge in following domains. Example below:

**Programming:** [8] R, Python, Java

**Statistics:** [10] linear, logistic, multivariate, data cleaning, etc.

**Machine Learning:** [7]: SVM, Boosted Trees, Neural Networks, etc.

**Years in field:** 8

**Areas of weakness/things you want to learn better:** [anything]

Have a degree in applied econometrics.

But, then i go into the real world and have issues finding what techniques to apply to real life situations.

For example,  i work for a company that has a program where they act as a 3rd party marketplace. As a part of this marketplace, they initially had one warranty program where a buyer could pay one of our inspectors money and if there was damage/issues with the product, we as the marketplace would buy it back.  This would take place immediately after the transaction.

We later added a warranty where none of our inspectors would check out the product. but the buyer would have 30 days to return the product and we would personally buy it back, no questions asked.

you would think since they are both warranties, that their would be cannabilization.  but both prodcuts went up.

so my issues with this problem(and most others) is that while i know the software and have some stats knowledge, since im mostly self taught. I dont know how to apply it to truly investigage the data statistically.

You can then calculate the probability of a given posts comment structure. I'd like to take a given set of posts and estimate p. What's the best way to do this.
