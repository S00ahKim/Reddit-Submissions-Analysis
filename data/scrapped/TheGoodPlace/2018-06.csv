She did get a different soul mate at first but I think having a house that she likes would work better along with a perfect soulmate.

Watched again sober, still just as amazing. Not gonna be a pretentious twat and say it was a ""masterful work of art"" or anything, but it sure as hell was an amazing opener that, imo, does the whole season justice.

When I first watched the first episode, me and a friend were stoned off our asses. She asked me what kind of show I wanted to watch, and I, having just smoked a copious amount of weed, said very vaguely that I wanted to watch something ""atmospheric"". She almost instinctually pulled up the good place, and we got right in. It was a bit slow for my stoner sensibilities at first, but very quickly I was pulled right in.

The calm, peaceful attitude that the residents of the good place seemed to have, combined with the eccentric, whimsical personality of Michael made for a delightful introduction and story flow, climaxing in the brilliant reveal about Eleanor (the one that serves as the main premise for a large part of season 1. You know what I'm referring to) made sure that, even though I was high off my rocker, 110% of my attention was focused on the show. Additionally, the unnecessary but very, very much appreciated details, most notably (imo) Michael's mannerisms, I.E. his quirky way of speaking, the way he moved his hands while speaking, only made me love it more.


I don't want to make this too much longer, so I'll skip to the part that really made me sure this episode was a gold standard: Near the end of the episode, Eleanor wakes up to Ariana Grande playing. She walks over to the window, opens the curtains, and it appears that all surrealistic-hell has broken loose: A Giant lady bug, a giant frog, flying shrimp, missiles flying, just all kinds of amazing, insane pandemonium. When I was high, the sudden shift from the ""perfect"", serene atmosphere to the absurdist, surrealistic, intense atmosphere had me completely and totally astonished, in the most positive and amazed sense of the word. Having rewatched episode 1 completely sober, that sudden switch to absurdity still sends shivers down my spine, simply because of how fantastic it was. 

It's possible that I'm just over appreciative of it because the first time I saw it, I was very, very high. I mean, even a stupid magic trick from the fuckin dollar tree could ""astonish"" someone who was as stoned as I was, after all. But I honestly believe that, sober or otherwise, the brilliant premise, the hilarious jokes, the great character development, and most importantly, the fantastic world building, can all stand their own ground as an example of how excellent design, direction, and writing can create an even more excellent product.

I know I'm preaching to the choir a bit here, but I just wanted to share my thoughts on the show, and this seemed like a good place (ha) to do it. And don't worry, I don't take the show too seriously. I'm not gonna sit here and say it's the new Citizen Kane or whatever. I do however sincerely believe it's one of the best tv comedies this decade, and certainly the best(spoiler tagged the genre cause its sorta a spoiler for people just starting the show) [dystopian](/sp) comedy I've ever seen. It's just a great show.

At the end of season Two, eleanor wakes up in the 'real world' and eventually meets Chidi, after a year of being saved by Michael. Fans found it strange that Chidi could speak English at the end of the season finale, even though in Season One, episode one, he said he was speaking french but his speech was translated to english via the magic of the good place. Because of this, fans assumed that the 'real world' Eleanor was in was indeed a simulation made by the Judge and Michael. 
However, hear me out.
We know The Afterlife is timeless. This is because after Mindy Saint Clair arrived in the Afterlife, she was bought to the medium place because of all the good her operation (led by her sister) did. As Mindy had just started the operation when she died, the after life must be a place irrevelant to time or at least capeable of bringing people to the Good, bad, or medium place whenever they want. 
So, it is fair to assume that Eleanor, Michael, Jason, and Chidi did not die a the same time but instead were bought to 'The Good Place' at the same time. 
This means that while Eleanor had her life saved by Michael, years before that Chidi could have had his life saved by Michael. (remember chidi's death scene? it was kinda hillarious). 
So, when Eleanor meets Chidi in the end of the Season 2 finale, Chidi could have been saved from death years before that, and therefore have time to change himself and learn English.

I binge watched both seasons this weekend after coming across it randomly. While I predicted the twist ending of season one as Kristen Bell was living my version of what hell is like down to the creepy clowns and the nicey nice no swearing, I found the season two's finale.... odd. 


My theory. What if they are still in the bad place not reincarnated. The Judge is just one of the demon actors, I mean she seasons her food with envy! Whenever Kristen tries to be good those around her bring her down with a lead pipe. When she circles back to her old ways Micheal nudges her to try again so she's always wavering between the two and never achieving either. 


First season a fake heaven. Second season is actually purgatory as they're faced with their flaws. Third season is actual hell with them starting in limbo (wavering between good and bad) then making themselves miserable while trying to reach the so called good place which is always dangled infront of them but like a balloon already floating away is out of their reach.

There was something very fishie in the finale. I actually re-watched the last three episodes and they were... odd. 


1. Mendoza used a Molotov cocktail to create a wall of fire between them and the demons to make their escape. 

Why would that matter to demons? They adore fire and the show went out of it's way to frame that in a previous episode of the same season! 


2. The judge seasons her food with the envy, actual envy.



3. Mendoza's test makes no sense. She wanted him to actually think out of the box and ask not to play? She wanted him to think at all? 


My theory is that the show is allowing itself one of two paths to use in case the network gave them another season. 


Path A. the obvious one, they are still in the bad place being tortured. The judge is a demon playing her role and the whole thing was by design because the demons are having some fun with the humans. They use the self improvement guise and make their after-life a struggle that goes no where (they do good, it backfires. They relapse and it feels bad so they try again. repeat.)


Path B. A different direction. 

There is no bad place. This really is the good place, they are put through it all because secretly they wanted to be better and never got the chance on earth. well here's a chance and the angles/demons are one and the same. They're job is to push you in whatever direction your soul wants to go... with St. Clair being the one stagnating because she refuses to move from her spot.",7,34,False,self,,,,,

There is something that needs to be clarified before proceeding. If there is an afterlife in The Good Place Universe (TGPU hereafter), then death is clearly not the same as just ceasing to exist. Although our four humans are very much dead, they havent stopped existing. As of Season 2, they exist Somewhere Else (ignoring the part where they are back on Earth/in a simulation of the Earth). Of course, there are certain things Im hoping the show clears up next season, which I will talk about at the end. 
Now, to begin presenting my arguments for why I think the real Good Place doesnt exist. These are in two parts: arguments that suggest The Good Place doesnt exist, and arguments that suggest The Good Place is actually ceasing to exist. 
To start off with the first kind, there has been no real description of the Good Place by any character except for the fact that no one seems to know how to get there, whereas weve heard loads about the Bad Place and have even seen the Medium Place. Secondly, the only character we know who belongs to the real Good Place is Janet, but this fact may as well be false. We know that Michael stole her and said that They just leave them lying around, but if the Good Place itself is so well guarded that not even Michael knows how to get there, why would they just leave their Janets lying around? If everyone outside the Good Place is bad, the Janets would of course be in a lot of danger of being misused. Furthermore, we know that this show is good at overturning its own premise more than once. However, the only premise set up since the pilot that hasnt been turned on its head (and that we have very easily taken for granted), is that there even exists a Good Place. Whos to say the whole thing isnt an experiment to see if the very idea of a Good/Bad/Medium place works or not? Speaking of which, the reason for not sending the humans to the Good Place (that they only seek moral dessert) given by the Judge seems more of an excuse to me than a reason. Isnt the whole concept of doing the right thing based on moral dessert? Even if people dont explicitly do good things just to ensure moral dessert in the afterlife, they do them for satisfaction/a clear conscience/ eternal gains in the form of a legacy. Also, it is unfair to say that those who did good did so because they were seeking moral dessert while at the same time making the bad people suffer moral punishment.
This brings me to the reasons for why I think the real Good Place is not a place, but a condition of not existing at all. As we know, TGP bears a striking resemblance to Jean Paul Sartres No Exit. By the end of the play (as by the end of season 1), the characters conclude that Hell is other people.  However, being completely alone is not so good either. Mindy St. Claire (who seems to have more bad than good in her way, according to this Reddit post) lives alone, and to be honest, looks very tortured when the four first meet her. This means that even if youre given something medium, the constancy of it makes it bad over time. If youre alone, you get bored. If youre with other people, thats its own kind of torture. In the end, it doesnt matter what you get, youre going to get tired of it eventually. The opposite is no better either  if everything kept changing all the time, you would never have the time to enjoy everything peacefully. If you had to move to a different house and a different climate almost every day, surely, youd be tired of it in a while. True bliss then, is simply to stop existing then, because the only way you wont be tortured is if you dont exist. As long as you exist, you have expectations, boredom, and familiarity breeding contempt, or constant flux.",6,3,False,self,,,,,

Season 2 Episode 4

Something at Attempt #801 changed Michael. 
Michael was also quite frustrated to the point where he seeked advice unto Jason.

Season 2 Episode 5

Michael had the dilemma of realizing the idea of not existing. (DEATH SIMPLY) Eleanor told him that everyone is simply unhappy everytime.

Season 2 Episode 6

Michael began torturing Chidi and Eleanor (Again) to blow off some steam and Eleanor gave an advice about how Michael was ""Pulling an Eleanor."" lashing out when you feel like a failure. And realizing how Similar Michael and Eleanor are. And Michael accepting the advice that Eleanor gave him.


Season 2 Episode 7

Michael was supposed to stop the wedding but he steps back and asked Eleanor to do it instead because chidi got to his head.

Michael also held some fascination on seeing how Eleanor changed.(From knowing all the bad things that Eleanor did on earth) because I think he himself felt like he changed too. 

Season 2 Episode 10 

Eleanor: Be careful.

Michael:Be careful? Oh! Are you worried about me?

Eleanor: Yeah Im worried. I mean. Cause you're our ticket out of here. Genius. Don't be all goofy on me.

Micahel: Just worry about them. I'll be fine.


Season 2 Episode 11

Michael gave Eleanor the pin. He sacrificed himself and even kinda solved the trolley problem.


Season 2 Episode 12

Michael gave Eleanor a little ""Push"" And gave her the same advice that she had given to Michael. (Episode 7 little voices on her head. Her conscience.)

From their Michael gave her a push towards Chidi from saying ""What do we owe each other."" 

Which you can also relate to the ripped page of the book ' What do we owe each other' that Eleanor had written ""FIND CHIDI""


 
And what's up with Michael why do I feel like he is becoming human. I know the whole point of the Ethics lesson is to help Michael learn about being human but still it's really odd on how he began reacting to things.

Everything seem to revolve around. Michael has a problem- Eleanor resolves it or helps him overcome it.
or vice versa.

First and foremost, Chidi does not belong there. Jason does not belong there. Tahani does not belong there. Eleanor does not belong there.

Chidi is there because his indecision causes harm to others. That is not a logical argument. The very nature of being good is indecision because in a world full of complex working morally grey choices, it is nearly impossible to be ""good"" (which effectively destroys the whole notion of an afterlife on its own)

Jason is a moron. Someone being intellectually disadvantaged and presented a poor ability to develop cannot inherently be a bad person. This is clearly even shown by his simple logic. I throw a molotov (A) and my problem changes (B) its reactionary. It's simple. 

Tahani only wants the love and approval of her parents. A biological need that drives her to do good and better things. This doesn't make her selfish, nobody is entirely altruistic, this is something that they haven't even brought up in the work of ethics (ethnics) yet. There is always a driving force and mechanism behind the actions that are ""good""

and lastly, Eleanor, who honestly, of the three is the only real ""Shitty"" person made evident by her constant nagging of how ""I deserve a medium place"". While she is depicted a ""victim"" of her circumstances she already made clear relevance to the fact she knew what she was doing was ""wrong"" and chose to do it anyway. Which is inherently ""bad"". 

So as a whole, the cast set up is kind of dumb when trying to present the premise of people being eternally punished. Especially when the premise for season 3 is now ""They'll change so they can get in the good place because they don't know the good place exists"" but its the same repeated nonsense (good nonsense, delivered by great actors, and great chemistry) of the first 2 seasons. Eleanor can not and will not change without Chidi. That is a HUGE problem. If all it takes is one person to define another, then people are being damned to torture over something they have zero control over. Inherently people do not exhibit free will and rely on a number of circumstances in which decide their behavior. This was only made evident by over 800 resets in the good bad place. 

So Season 3 is presenting with a pretty shit opus and I'm not overly enthused to see it. I had hoped that the character development at this point would have carried the show forward to illustrate how they can get others to change. A third season where you meet people who are inherently ""bad"". This way it clearly draws a line between our group and them taking it away from a question of ""free will not existing"" and ""victims of circumstance"" to an innate nature of cruelty, although even if that too were the case its destroyed by the fact that due to the variable nature of individuality and circumstances the fact a heaven/hell good/bad yes/no place even exists is entirely flawed.",22,0,False,self,,,,,

Chidi's test was unfair. There are so many tests within tests and switcheroos in this afterlife, that he had ever right to think there might something more to the test than choosing a hat.

Tahani's test - she is NEVER told not to look in the other doors. She just has to get to the door at the end of the hall. So, popping into one room, having a listen, then moving on, doesn't seem to break the rules.

But Jason's test. I don't understand it at all. He had to play Madden (that was Madden, right?) as the Titans against the Jaguars. I get how that would be challenging. But how was he supposed to know to ask if he could opt out of playing? I really don't understand the point of his test at all. 

Any thoughts?",21,11,False,self,,,,,
