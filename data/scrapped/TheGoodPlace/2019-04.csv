I know he's a doofus with very little self-awareness, and that he lacks impulse control- but I think that his lack of self-awareness is symbolic.  He's an accidental ""monk"" fairly often.

Firstly, he has the exact same experience everywhere he goes... heaven, earth, hell- it's all the same to him.  Just one fluid, continuous moment.  He is able to enjoy himself in the same ways virtually anywhere.

Though unknowingly, he repeatedly points out the arbitrary nature of ""points"", ""ratings"" and other external ways of measuring ""value"".  To him, raising ""a thousand bucks for charity"" is the same thing as raising 60 billion.  I also think his ""unnecessarily confusing"" points system (in which 8 is higher than 10) is symbolic of this.  He's also able to see value in *most* things very easily since he's humble and takes little for granted.  He's delighted by the most seemingly insignificant things.

He's too chill and authentic to use or appreciate artifice, frivolity, etc.

Obviously he has his less developed/negative traits (which are balanced out nicely by Tahani's various positive qualities, such as poise, restraint and discernment).

I was just listening to the podcast, and in episode 22 they mention an Easter egg in a later episode (Leap to Faith) where you can actually see a panda teleporting from one rooftop to another -- [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/ks5lZGC).

I'd like to share with you a theory that came to my mind and seemed interesting.  What if The Good Place does not exist any more? As Michael said, it is odd that no one has gotten into it for 500 years. What if somehow The Bad Place managed to destroy it? And the other part of the theory, a new Good Place is rising.  There are some main elements about this to explain.

1. Who was Gwendolyn and the Committe? 

Well, as far as we know, Gwendolyn doesn't seem to have much communication with The Good Place itself, so maybe she just hasn't realized yet, or maybe, as I'm almost certain if this is true, she was a demon, just like the Committe, pretending to be someone else, those people were so annoying the only thing they made was kinda torturing Michael, so that's my thought about them.

2. What about the Judge?

The Judge is truly lazy and careless, so guys, let's be honets, do you really think she'd realise? I don't have much to add to this part, she's spending most of her time watching TV.

3. What about Good Janet?

imo, this is pretty easy, they didn't destroy the system where they are made.

That's it about this part, let me know if you can think of something else about it.

Now, what is going to happen then? Well, this is the most interesting part, the New Good Place is starting now, the Soul Squad are creating it. Once the experiment is over and, sure after struggling, worked, I think the Judge will allow them to enter The Good Place, that's when they will realize it exist no more. Then, they will decide to create the Good Place, where they not only take in good people but people who can improve and become better in the afterlife.

Sorry it was too long, let me know what you guys think.",4,7,False,self,,,,,

But the question I've recently had is that although this show has made be a better person, but by telling me that there is a good and bad place, it's also influenced my decision making in certain ways. Ways it might be selfish. So every good action I do no matter how good my intention is, has a probability that it's tainted right ? I don't know!

Does Michael design the good place also partly because he is more sympathetic to humans, and not just 'fun'? May be he can't say it out loud,  because he is a bad place architect and that's why he says torturing his way would be fun. 

May be Michael is actually a nice guy trying to put on the 'tough cloak' so to speak.

I assume that you only go to the Good or Bad Place if you have the free will to be responsible for your decisions and actions. This means that there must have been billions of years that went by while the eternal beings and the Judge were waiting for humans to evolve and then develop free will.

So, what were they doing during all that time? Do aliens with free will go to the Good/Bad Place too? If so then there might have been alien civilisations that developed way before humans and might have been going to the afterlife for billions of years before us.

But, when the Judge is talking about stuff at the end of s2 then she only mentions that she doesn't like to get involved in *human* affairs, no mention of the affairs of other sentient beings, which makes me think it's just humans. However, I'm sure she implies that she has some kind of jurisdiction over *EVERYTHING*, so like I  wonder whether she also judges aliens as well.

The new ""humans"" are demons in skin suits.


Something about Simone showing up never quite sat right with me. Either she conveniently died exactly when Shawn needed her to. Very lucky. Or the demons used the illegal portal to go murder her. I wouldn't put it past them. Or the judge authorized them to pick any humans, living or dead. She's almost apathetic enough to do so, but I'm not sure she wouldn't have been more specific when laying out the rules.

But all three of those options seemed a bit too straight forward, and this is a show that loves its twists. I think Shawn did the same thing that Michael did... took advantage of the Judge's lack of oversight. He went to accounting and said ""We need these four files sent to the judge."" Then he had his demons sent through to the Medium Place's office from the portal in the Bad Place (which is where the Judge would expect them to show up anyway, since everyone's gone there for 500 years).

Shawn took a full report from Vicky and picked the four best possible demons for the job, coupled with the four best possible human roles for them to play.

Quinston is there to torture Tehani as the blogger.

Vicky is in Simone. When Eleanor finds out that Chidi erased himself for the greater good over a prank, she hits a [despair event horizon.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon) (Warning: Those links goes to tvtropes... use the buddy system if you're going to click it.)

They are usually loud and obnoxious or just silly without much substance.

I started watching The Good Place just for fun because I wanted to watch something easy and relaxing. Turned out that, while easy and relaxing, this show was witty and even intelligently made.

Eleanor Shellstrop dies and goes to Good Place which should be a version of Heaven where everything is perfect, you have all you need and more and you even get to meet your true soulmate with what you are supposed to spend the whole eternity together.

Eleanors soulmate is Chidi Anagonye, a professor on ethics which is really fresh because you rarely see philosophy professors featured in any mainstream show/movie let alone be a cool guy and also one of the main characters. In the Good Place, Chidis goal and mission became to teach Eleanor ethics so every episode we hear about different philosophers take of morality. With everything nowadays revolving about weed and booty its refreshing to see that a show attempted to educate people about different philosophical schools even if it was in a light and passing way. Kudos to that!

To be honest, Chidis lectures are not particularly interesting but the whole show deals with the concept of morality.

**Spoilers ahead!**

I liked the shows take on the concept of good and bad. It was done in a very clever way.

At first, we believe that it is Eleanor who got mixed with someone else and ended up in the Good Place by mistake. Then we realize that shes not the only one as Jason is also pretending to be a Buddhist monk. The real twist comes from the end of the first season  it is when we learn that the Good Place is not good at all  its actually the Bad Place and Michael is a demon!

Its a great take on our beliefs of the afterlife, Hell and Heaven but also on our perception of what is good and what is bad.

Simply put, whatever we thought was good in the Good Place was bad. Hell is not shown as a pit of fire where little demons torture you for eternity. Hell is depicted as being perfect and its our own fear of imperfection what is torturing us. It is a great metaphor for the real world, too. Our fears are our worst enemies.

Once the four realized that they werent living in a perfect Good Place and that their imperfections could actually save them from the eternal damnation, they became proactive in terms of finding the solution not only for themselves but also for the whole humanity.

Further we go into the show, we realize that its not only that the four main characters are in the Bad Place  everyone is. No matter how great or small or completely insignificant their bad deeds were on Earth, everyone went to the Bad Place. Even the person whose life obsession was to score points for the Good Place couldnt get enough points to go there. He spent his entire life sacrificing himself to the point of not living the life at all and he was still heading to the Bad Place.

Well see what will happen in the next season but we hope that they will continue doing the great work!",5,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

The man has acted nothing but good for nearly forty years to keep his soul safe. Well, not *just* to keep it safe, as he got some points and therefore must have done some things partly out of altruism. But those points could be years old, and by now he clearly worries more about his score than about helping people. 

I want to know how he is going to act once he believes he's made it into the Good Place. Five bucks say he's gonna be the anti-Eleanor: Getting progressively worse now he knows he's earned his place in heaven, endangering everyone's souls in the process, and just being a massive, no fun, pain in the bum for mostly Eleanor and her ""assistant"" Michael to handle.

Shawn will want to prove that people can also get worse in Michael's Good Place. The only way Doug could be any better than he was in life is to stay the same in the afterlife, even after he got his reward. There's no way he'd do that, so that's an automatic win for Shawn. Doug would be the ideal person to send, especially as Michael used to be such a fanboy and would be thoroughly disillusioned if Doug started acting bad. Also I want to see how Doug would react to that portrait of him hanging in Michael's office.

Plus he's an old man who lives off lentils and radishes and drinks his own filtered pee, so he's the one known person whose sudden death would actually make sense, unlike Simone's (or Pillboy's, or Dave's, or Eleanor's roommate). Ok, I'd buy Henry dying; he was hospitalized twice already and fake-died in the Trolley Problem, so he got hurt every season. And he's two years ahead in the timeline from the last thing Chidi remembers, so that could be interesting... But I'm getting off-topic.

So about the memory-erase. They couldnt selectively erase Simone and Chidi from each others memories, and the explanation for Chidi was because his memories of Simone are tied up with the rest of the group. So his memories are being reset to his first life, when he died via air-conditioner, and he will believe he never met the rest of the group.

But even though Simones memories are being wiped to the point before she met them, in real life she DID meet them, and create a huge project she had gotten approved and funded and worked on for a year and had planned on further work with new subjects. This storyline still happened even if Chidi &amp; Simone dont remember (since John will still remember how Tahani died), and she wouldnt have necessarily dropped the project after she &amp; Chidi broke up.

But Chidi can be TOLD that he died on that sidewalk in front of Uzo. While Simone KNOWS her life continued for who knows how long post-brain school...what does she think she worked on and hung out with during that missing time?

Why wouldnt that be essentially the same problem as selectively erasing Chidis memory of her but not Eleanor?

My ranking would go:

**1. Eleanor.** I think Kristen Bell is a fantastic actress, she has some incredibly funny lines, and she's gotten by far the best character development. It might be the easy answer, but it's the right one.

**2. Michael.** The relationship between Michael and Eleanor is one of the hearts of the show, and I'd say that Michael's arc has been the second best, after Eleanor's. He's a great character and him and Eleanor can probably be considered the main main characters.

**3. TIE.** I really tried to break this tie, but I have to declare it one. It's a tie between Tahani and Janet. I loved Tahani at first, but they haven't really developed her character much. She's just kinda been there. Janet, on the other hand, I also loved at first. But, unlike Tahani, she has gotten some development. I'm just not sure it's good development. She's less funny as time goes on and her infatuation with Jason at some points borders on creepy. But she's still a great and very funny character. 

**5. Chidi.** Gotta say, I don't really like Chidi. I think his whole schtick can be annoying, and his lines are rarely funny imo. I also don't relate to him much -- who can be *that* indecisive? However, I'm not sure that he's meant to be the funny character. He's literally the moral compass of the group, and at that, he does a decent job. It just doesn't necessarily make him likable.

**6. Jason.** Far and away my least favorite character. I hate his stupidity, it goes beyond all rationality. He has no growth whatsoever. He's a static, painfully stupid character who serves primarily as comic relief, but I don't find comedy in him, so he has become by far my least favorite character.",13,4,False,self,,,,,

**Confucianism: The Bureaucracy of Heaven**

In Confucianism, and classical Chinese religion, they believed that there was an Empero of Heaven, called the Jade Emperor. But unlike Zeus or Odin who are ""kings of the gods"" but you don't see them doing weird government things, the Jade Emperor is all about weird government things, he has a secretary of Education, and Economy, Ministers of Justice and Development, he fills paperwork, he makes laws, it's just like a real government, called the Bureaucracy of Heaven.

The Afterlife in the show doesn't have a ""Jade Emperor"" but there definitely is a Bureaucracy of Heaven that works like a real government but deals with souls and other heavenly things.

**Christianity: Eternal Bodies**

In Christianity Jesus resurrected and ascended to Heaven with his body. From this Catholicism and many other Christian denominations believe that since God itself has a body we will too. They believe that at the end of times all the dead will be resurrected, their bodies ""reconstructed"", they will be judged and proceed to Heaven or Hell.

In the show we see that at no point are they ""spirits"", they still eat, their bodies still feel pain and pleasure, apparently they even still go to the bathroom. Even the demons and angels have bodies.

**Mormonism: Zion**

Besides Eternal Bodies mormons also believe in Zion, the Heavenly Jerusalem. A perfect city where all the good people will live in the afterlife.

Interestingly Joseph Smith drew the blueprints of Zion, specifying that it had at most 20 thousand people, when it was filled another Zion would be built, also up to 20 thousand people, and so on. Each Zion would have 62 neighborhoods, meaning that each neighborhood would have around 322 people, just like the neighborhoods in the show.

**Hinduism: Karma**

This one is pretty obvious. Many religions want you to be good but don't believe that you will be judged by all the good or bad things you did. Christianity is big on the whole forgiveness thing, and both Christianity and Islam specify that it doesn't matter if you are good, you also have to believe.

Hinduism in the other hand specifies that it doesn't matter what you believed, only what you did, that your actions earn you ""karma"" much like money, or points, and that determines to which heaven you go or where you are reborn, depending on the specific branch of hinduism.

In the show they explain that all your actions earn you positive or negative points, and that those points determine who goes to the good or bad place.

And that's it for me, but if you have find any other references to some religions I would love to hear it",59,535,False,self,,,,,

She said that if you wanted to go to the good place, and you were good just because of that, then you would go to the bad place because your motivations were corrupted. So if you were bad on purpose, would you still go to the bad place? 

Most likely. 
Even if you dont necessarily want to be mean, you still are hurting someone and not caring. For example, if you tell someone their acting is terrible, even if you dont want to really hurt someone, you still are and wont bother to care. 
A true good person would feel terrible about hurting someone, even if they want to go to the bad place.

And why would you even want to go to the bad place? You like being tortured? Weird flex but ok. However, since the bad place is modified based on the person, you wont be tortured. So there really is no reason to go to the bad place.",0,1,False,self,,,,,
