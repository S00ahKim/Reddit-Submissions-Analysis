Here's yet another prediction for how it will all end - forgive me if someone else already proposed this.

I think the Judge will give our lovely group of six heroes a chance to start what Eleanor has been proposing all along: a Medium Place, where just OK people can improve themselves. The Judge has acknowledged that all four of our humans have made significant progress, even if they aren't ready for the Good Place, and therefore might acknowledge the possibility of improvement (after all, Eleanor was able to become good enough for the Good Place - a pretty profound problem for such a binary afterlife!) The Judge doesn't want to send them on up, but now that she has Michael on her hands, an immortal who can't return to the Bad Place without being destroyed, she might realize she can't exactly just send them back. I think it was previously mentioned that there's plenty of empty space in the neutral zone, so there's already room. Moreover, they have everything they need to start a Medium Place:

* Michael, who could be the local ""divine"" person in charge. 
* An incredibly advanced Janet to build and maintain it
* Chidi, an ethics instructor who was so skilled he flipped a bad person to a good person, and already showed his desire to turn torturing into teaching (his advice as Trrrrrrrrent)
* Eleanor, living (???) proof that such a transition is possible
* Tahani, who can help make people feel at home and (maybe help choose people, in general?)
* Jason!

The next season would be about the gang taking in new people and trying this experiment out, and about Chidi, Tahani, and Jason trying to become good people themselves.

There's two further reasons I think that this will happen - first, the Judge has made clear that she is *super bored*, and also pretty chill about things, so maybe that was foreshadowing interest in such a new place. Second, I don't think the show can show us the Good Place yet - it would kind of rob the show of its main goal. And besides, how do you really show paradise? Not that I would put it past these guys, since the show is so awesome...",15,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've been struggling with this:
- Everything good thing you do makes you look weak to bad (/average?) people (their perspective) and they can't help but start to try and take advantage, see what they can get from you, be it money/loans, time, services.

Example: A friend is struggling with bills and can't afford proper nutritious meals for their kids, so you offer to help them out. Not a loan, a gift. Before long they're asking for money for other things, stuff their kid needs like school clothes. All sorts of new colourful excuses/reasons are coming out of them. Each and every one seems reasonable in isolation. This starts to seem more like enabling bad behavior/dependency than doing a good thing.

Chidi can't talk about contractualism for 3 hours without it being our topic for this week.

* **Contractualism is (shocker) about a contract.**

Contractualism is a social contract theory.  A social contract is a way of thinking about morality or political theory which bases legitimate systems on some sort of mutual agreement in principle between the people involved.  

So a secret afterlife of eternal beings judging, torturing, and setting point values is _not_ a social contract theory.  Social contracts are much more earthbound.

Think of it like a game.  The game only works if all the teams agree on the rules.  And anything can be allowed which all the teams agree to write in the rules.  But if you're the Jacksonville Jaguars and the only way you can win is with some rule changes (and an offense and a defense), you can't just change them for yourself.

* **So what's the contract here?** 

Scanlon writes his theory as thus:

&gt;An act is wrong if its performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any set of principles for the general regulation of behaviour that no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced, general agreement.

So let's break it down.

* **This is all about wrongness.  No positive points for you.**

Scanlon's set up here is all about deciding what things are wrong to do.  So what is ""right"" to do? Whatever's not wrong.  If it's wrong to eat meat, then it's right to be a vegetarian.  

If it's wrong to steal your roommate's dress, rip it, hang it back up, let her find it, let her blame someone else, let her get internet trolled for her overreacting blame, make T-shirts about her trolling, sell the T-shirts, and keep the profit; then it is right to... not do that.

* **Everyone gets a veto on the general rules.**

It's not that everyone has to agree when they write all the rules, but as Chidi tells us, we can veto rules we disagree with.

This is Scanlon's way of getting around Kant's hyper-abstracted thing where he thought the basic principles of morality could be distilled from pure reason.  Here instead, we're basically all just sitting around seeing if we can put up rules that nobody can reasonably veto.  To be reasonable you have to have a good enough reason though.  Can't just be that you don't want to do the dishes.

* **We are signing the contract as we are, not in an abstract meta-world**

One notable thing about Scanlon is that he is not asking us to give up our identities to sign this contract.  John Rawls famously suggests such a method, called the ""veil of ignorance"" where we write the rules without knowing where we end up in the society those rules create.

Scanlon is much more hard-nosed about this and says we should agree on the rules from the world we inhabit today, whether that be hosting a lovely charity gala with two Goslings on our arms, doing whip-its in a safe in Florida, or in a weird fake neighborhood in the afterlife.

---

Notes:  [A special thanks to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for this one,](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/) since I didn't really read Scanlon in school and I am basically pulling a freshman ""read article and summarize"" trick here.

Also since this is not something I know super well, please fire off any correctives you have in the comments.  I'll be happy to edit anything I'm wrong about.

Now hes able to meet with the judge, have a private conversation with her...and convince her to restore the core 4 to life (or perhaps a Lost-like alternative but either way hes messing with reality).

When he speaks to the judge he passionately says, maybe were wrong, maybe humans can change! The judge even says she has goosebumps (as if being spoken to by a deity?)

But I started thinking about how Eleanor is really led to being a good person by Chidi's teaching, which seemed to be the key in the end of that episode. There have been a lot of posts lately about Chidi not having made much progress. In my opinion, only Eleanor truly made significant progress - Tahani still name drops like crazy, and I'm not sure she's fully realized the value of doing good things for the sake of *the good they result in*; Chidi still hurts those around him with his indecisiveness; and Jason just has no idea what's going on. Besides Eleanor, I'm not sure any of them have fully embraced that they were people who needed to change, not because otherwise they would end up in the bad place, but because it was the right thing to do.

The only thing I can really see that Eleanor does for Chidi is help him be more decisive - he can tell her he loves her, he can grab her for a kiss, even when he can't choose a freakin hat. She also does a good job of questioning the philosophies he holds dear, since he seems intent on sticking to one view, whereas she likes to pull different things she agrees with from different philosophies.

The season finale was brilliant. The judge pointed out the  problem of Michael's experiment. The humans became good because they KNEW they had to. They became good not only because of their innate desire to be good, but the reward of being good (chance to avoid eternal torture). 


A truly good person keeps being good for the goodness of itself. The goodness itself is the only reward for being good. 


The conversation at the bar between Eleanor and Michael was nerve-breaking. Here this person, back to her terrible old ways, is bitching about getting no reward for being good, with no idea that in front of her stands an immortal being who knows fully well that the eternal fate of her soul hangs in the balance at that very moment. The stake literally cannot be any higher. 

This is like the modern version of the book Pilgrim's Progress, only that our pilgrim does not know she is in the midst of the ultimate test of the universe. 


It reminds me of a bible verse: ""we would be a stage play for the universe, for Angels and for men."" (1 Corithian 4:7) 

Maybe we are in a cosmic test right now too in our own lives, with angels and demons (or Michaels and Janets) watching over our heads, rooting for us or laughing at us. Maybe the things we worry about now, job, money, house, has zero eternal consequence; maybe we are setting ourselves up for eternal salvation or damnation everyday with every trivial choice we make without giving a second thought. 

(Did not mean to get preachy here; just my thoughts after watching this episode)


Very few TV shows or movies can handle moral debates without seeming superficial, forced or preachy. This show handles it so well, in such a fresh and hilarious way. Now with them back on earth, I say we can get at least three more wonderful seasons. Hooray!

But it sounds like these two also have Extended Cuts (both because of other threads in this subreddit and because ""Best Self"" has one listed as being available on the On Demand service for Spectrum):

*Leap to Faith

*Best Self

*Everything is Great! (Part 1)

*Everything is Great! (Part 2)

Bonus side question: Are the ""Extended Cuts"" available on Spectrum's On Demand service *actually* the Extended Cuts or are they labeled incorrectly?

And by the fact that Dish Network's On Demand service doesn't show any Extended Cuts as being available, or at least doesn't have them labeled as such (it only seems to have the regular versions of the episodes).

To undo the deaths of four people could have wide-ranging effects on many lives.

Simple example: Suppose they undid those deaths. Start with Eleanors job. Whoever originally replaced her, didnt, at least not at that time. And then Eleanor changed jobs. That means someone got her old job, and whoever originally got the other job (with the environmentalist group) didnt, because she got it instead. The person who filled Eleanors spot at the old job is someone who originally might have filled a position somewhere else, but undoing things would leave that position open for someone else, which could then have similar effects for another person at another job, and so on. Similarly, the person who originally got Eleanors new job would eventually find a job somewhere else, taking a position that originally went to someone else, who would then have to find a job elsewhere that eventually went to someone else, and so on. 

Thats just one example, but even just from that, you get several other changes. People meet people at work and through their coworkers. Let some time pass, then go back and change where a handful of people work during that time, and relationships may form that wouldnt have; or some that did form, might not. Babies who were born might never get conceived, if the past were changed. 

Furthermore, all those changes just might lead to the death of someone who then shows up in the Good or Bad Place, having died at a time when they originally hadnt. 

Or, someone who died originally might not die, somehow, through all the changes of events. But that person is already in either the Good Place or the Bad Place. Does that person get sent back to Earth? And do any of the immortal/demon characters notice?

There are too many repercussions to changing the past, including changes concerning who lives and dies, and the times people die, to undo four deaths. Erasing peoples existences would be horribly immoral, and inadvertently undoing other deaths would not only have results noticeable to those in charge of the afterlife, but also seems like a line that Michael and the Judge wouldnt cross, given the sorts of things they are or have been in charge of. 

And for those thinking something like, But maybe time doesnt even really pass in the afterlife:

I understand that it might be different there, and there was the thing about snorting the concept of time, but time does pass there. For example, the different simulations occur one after the other, and get numbered accordingly. Time passes for the immortals like Michael. Furthermore, it seems time there is correlated in some way with time on Earth, in the sense that people show up there in the order they die. When you first go to the Good Place, would you meet someone who was alive when you died, or would you have to wait (assuming you both make it to the Good Place). So while time is different in the realm of the afterlife/immortals on the show, time does pass there; and while their time may not correspond exactly to Earth time, they do seem correlated to an extent. 

And for anyone thinking, But this is just a TV show! They dont/wont/wouldnt think that far into all this:

This is a show in which the characters often discuss ethics and the effects people have on each other, and the whole premise of the show is centered around a system of moral judgment that determines ones fate in the afterlife. We cant assume they wouldnt or couldnt think of the same things Ive written about here. 


TL;DR: Changing the past can have major effects, including erasing lives and undoing deaths (remember Back to the Future?) Michael and the Judge wouldnt do that, and they would know theyd probably get caught if they did. ",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A lot of people have brought up how much time has passed since the show started, and while Im sure these immortal beings can manipulate time, its worth noting the biggest problem with bringing the four back to life: Everyone else they interact with. Everyone else who has since died and gone to either place. Everyone else who has existed in those 800 years.

Did everyone get pulled from both places? Did exact duplicates get made? What about people who wont be born/die due to a change in the timeline made?

This seems like a lot of work and both sides being angry, especially for the fate of four people who could easily go to the middle place.

So why would the judge do this? It doesnt make any sense. What does make sense, however, is that they arent alive again. They didnt return. Theyre in a larger neighborhood, controlled by the judge, as a final test.

This is why Chidi has no problem speaking English, after all in the good place (and fake bad place) everyone can natively understand each other. Its also why Michael has the ability to interact with them. ",34,34,False,self,,,,,

I think the characters may be in both the good place and the bad place...it's the same location experienced differently by different people

I've been reading a lot about Eastern Christianity's thoughts on the afterlife, which are quite a bit different from the popular conception of heaven and hell in the West.  We generally get the popular conception of hell from a mix of Dante, Milton, and the New Testament.

In the West, we just automatically assume:

1.) Heaven and hell are two distinct locations.

2.) Hell involves physical torture with demons and pitchforks.

3.) You can't escape the bad place

What if none of these are true?  What if the good place and bad place are the same place experienced differently by different people?  What if the torture is spiritual and mental torment rather than physical torment? Finally, what if you can ""escape"" the ""bad place"".

On the first point, Eastern Christians/the Orthodox generally view heaven and hell as the same place where a person's relations to or experiences of God's just and loving presence are different.  If a person is ""good"" or rightly-aligned with God's love, he or she experiences the depths and joy of this love.  If his or her nature is not aligned with God, then that person experiences horror.  Think of something like the light of the sun.  In the proper conditions, you enjoy its warmth and its light allows you to see.  But imagine if you've been in a dark cave for weeks and then step outside into the noon sun.  It will burn your eyes in immense pain and want you to retreat from it. Similarly, God's love is experienced either as torment or as paradise depending on the spiritual state of the person.  

Or think about how you feel when a relationship with a loved one is damaged by you.  Consider a good relationship with your parents/friend/spouse versus when you feel like you let them down or betrayed them.  Their love is still there for you and in light of that love, your betrayal causes immeasurable regret and pain within. 
 There is no physical or material pain but instead the suffering of the soul due to you poisoning that relationship.  Now imagine that this feeling is amplified to the nth degree - true anguish. Thus, the ""bad place"" is simply the ""good place"" not rightly experienced.  It is self-inflicted.  C.S. Lewis is known for saying that God does not throw anyone into hell.  Rather people willingly enter the hell.  ""The door to hell is locked from within""

So, the characters right now are not aligned with goodness, correct? What if they are actually in the place that can be either the good or bad place, but they're chosen to reject the good.  They have walled themselves off from it.  What if the good place is indeed within grasp?  What is they can reform their hearts and souls and align them with the good to finally be in the good place?  What is Michael's neighborhood was the good place but their bad selves simply ruined it all!  I have one theory that Michael may not actually be a demon but an angel giving them a second chance to experience the neighborhood in the right way

An alternative take on it by C.S. Lewis in the Great Divorce where people in hell can take a field trip to heaven.  These bad people are begged to give up the bad and offered a place in heaven, but they must align themselves with the good to do it.  In heaven, those aligned with goodness are more ""solid"" or materially sound versus the ""impure"" who are almost like ghosts with very little matter.  The good people are able to walk on the grass in heaven whereas to the impure people, the grass feel like sharp blades.   The rain is pleasant and refreshing to the good people but to the impure, it is heavy and painful.  Interestingly, the bad people do live in hell but they have the ability to go to heaven.  Once they leave that bad place, it ceases to be 'hell' and becomes purgatory - it was a temporary place to purge themselves of the bad.  But if these bad people choose to return to hell, it was hell and will always be hell.

On the second point, we have already seen that the bad place for our characters was not physical torture but rather this eternal conscious torture that they inflicted on one another and on themselves.

On the third point, there are different theories within Christianity as to whether your state can change after physical death. Protestants generally believe that you will be judged on your life on earth.  Catholics believe that some go straight to paradise, some go straight to hell, and others are purified in purgatory and will eventually go to paradise.  The Orthodox are more difficult to pin down.  There have been some Fathers who hoped for universal reconciliation (all will be saved eventually) and one or two who advocated universal reconciliation (not an orthodox view).  The show writers seem to be holding the view that this is the very first time someone has had a second chance after physical death.  But we are assuming that the 4 characters have the entire picture.

Interesting side thought: there has been discussion in theological circles as to whether demons or even the Devil could be saved eventually.  Could Michael (a fallen angel) ever be redeemed to? I think the show could go in this direction and he goes to the good place.  Or perhaps Michael himself is indeed a man who has been led to believe that he is a demon.  Perhaps he has an opportunity to show his goodness by looking for the good in bad people and aiding their quest for the good place?",1,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's the dramatic, high-stakes move, and it moves the story forward, not sideways as yet another simulation would.  That being said, it raises the question of how Gen and/or Michael could go so many years into the past without seriously f'ing up the timeline and messing not just with earth, but with many souls already assigned to the good place or bad place.

The answer, to me, seems quite simple: **Passage of time in TGP doesn't imply similar passage of time on Earth, and all the events on TGP (up until the final test) have taken place near the moment of Eleanor's death.**

Michael, et. al, are extra-dimensional beings.  (Earth) Time is a dimension they can move along when they wish (as when administering the final test) , but are not bound to.  This is why, after presumably hundreds of years have passed for the gang, the demons in the (real) bad place still have early 21st century clothes and mannerisms.

A couple more points against a simulation:

* The excitement/concern Gen has at the idea.  She had just put the gang through simulations.  If this were just another one, what's the big deal?

* The size/population of the world.  Michael's neighborhood was small and required demon actors to play the parts.  While we don't know Gen's abilities, a simulation of this magnitude would have no precedent on the show. 

* While Chidi should probably have an accent, the fact that he's teaching in Australia would indicate he can speak English as a second language.

1.) We have yet to see anyone from the actual Good Place, and have no idea what they're like or how they operate. We can probably assume that they are genuinely good though, just because TGP is a remarkably un-cynical, even anti-cynical show, and ""even the cosmic representatives of Goodness are actually jerks"" just doesn't sound like the kind of stance this show would take. So until we learn otherwise, we can assume that The Good Place is actually a good place, and the beings that run it are genuinely good (perhaps even **G**ood).

2.) The basic unfairness of the afterlife system, in which most of humanity gets condemned to eternal torture for failing to live up to astronomically high standards, has been a running theme of the show from the beginning. For a show that's as much about ethics and the right way to treat people as this show is, this issue HAS to be addressed, and the mere fact that it's been brought up more than once tells us that it will be.  Well-written shows don't bring up a major moral dilemma on multiple occasions just to brush it aside. I think this is going to play into the long-term arc for this show, so we may not see a resolution until the end of the series.

3.) The Bad Place keeps failing. Our four heroes were supposed to torture each other, but instead ended up being friends and helped each other to improve as people. Over and over again. In fact, every stage of their journey so far has served to gently (for the most part) correct their personality flaws and guide them onto the right path. The Bad Place tries to do evil, and instead produces goodness. This could be simple incompetence (aside from Michael and maybe Shawn, none of the Bad Place demons seem all that bright), but could also point to... dare I say... *sabotage*? 

4.) It was *way* too easy for Michael to steal a Good Janet. 

So where do these four points leave us? I'm not sure, but I think they point in a definite direction. The Good Place (as in the place, not the show) is up to something. They're pulling some hidden strings somewhere to frustrate the attempts of the Bad Place and guide our four main characters toward redemption. And since there's no apparent reason for these four people to get special treatment, we have to assume that whatever the plan is, it's meant for everyone. Either everyone gets the same treatment, or these four are a kind of trial run for an upcoming revolution in the way the afterlife is managed.

If I really wanted to go out on a limb, I'd say that the end goal is to save *everyone* from the Bad Place. Who knows... maybe everyone goes through some variation on what we've seen our four characters go through, sanding off their rough edges before they are eventually admitted to the Good Place. Maybe the Bad Place is less ""Hell"" and more ""Purgatory."" Maybe the Good Place has a mole inside the Bad Place (Michael?) manipulating events with the goal of transforming the Bad Place or even abolishing it entirely. 

Whatever the larger game plan turns out to be, the Good Place is definitely up to something. ",48,59,False,self,,,,,

At the end of their time on earth Tahani is throwing a party that might be some sort of fundraiser or birthday or wedding? She gets up and gives a sincere speech about how thankful she is to have everyone in her life. 

(at that point it cut to a discussion on this subreddit where someone pointed out that the necklace she was wearing meant that she was ""in the green"", so to speak. (It was a circular green pendant with a small drawing of a woman inside))

I don't remember how they ended up dying but they got back and Michael congratulated them on how well they had done. They had a small discussion where it turned out that it was, in fact, a simulation... the twist being that they weren't the only ones going through it and that there were currently many souls trying for a shot at redemption. 

Eleanor had gained the most points. She was in the millions. Tahani and Chidi were in the 1000-300,000 range. It was implied that Jason was still in the red but he was getting another shot.

If you want to order up 500 copies of your hot third grade teacher and do with them what you will, no one will ever know.  And you've got nothing but time on their hands.

I think the real Good Place residents will have fallen into anarchy, terror, or at least endless hedonistic excess.  On the flip side, I wouldn't be surprised at all if the poor saps in the Bad Place getting tortured by Chidi's ""Books"" initiative end up making themselves better people, too.

Now pulling on that thread a bit further, do you think it would be interesting to see more religious elements in the show, but reworked from their source? In the way the whole concept of an afterlife has been reworked? 

I thought it might be interesting to either name drop saints or demons or even religious events but reinterpreted for the show... and at the same time not that often, this show works as an amalgam, non-specific entity that it is. 

For example, when we saw Michael do what he does, I thought it would be interesting to find out that other demons/angels existed and believed as he did - that he system is flawed and wanted to change it (maybe they really like humans). Maybe there are immortal beings influencing certain humans to be better - and maybe they're not always succeeding, or accidentally making them worse!

An example; Luci. Lets say she's another immortal being doing what Michael just did - she hangs out on earth and tries to nudge people into being better. However, due to the law of unintended consequences her efforts don't always work. 

Oh, and Luci is short for Lucifer. 

It would tie into the guardian angel bit and lightly reference religious ideas, but also turned on its head and shifted so that it becomes unique to The Good Place. 

Anyway, just a thought. It's off-season now and we need stuff to talk about!

Now I can understand the argument that there would be a lot of potential ""butterfly effect"" consequences and moral issues implicated by Gen resurrecting them, especially in light of her comment that she reserved the right to end the experiment at any time.

However, the simulation idea seems really unfair to the leads.  And while I wouldn't necessarily expect fairness from Gen (she's an impartial judge but the whole system is pretty unfair to begin with and she views humans as entertaining ants), if this is a simulation, it's unfair such that it would contradict Gen asserting that what she's doing is a big effort and it wouldn't make sense for Michael to be banned from intervening, as Gen would be stacking the deck ""against"" the leads.

Specifically, considering what happened to Eleanor with the person whose car she rear-ended as well as with her other interactions, if this was a simulation, then I'd have to conclude that the concept wasn't really to test how Eleanor would act ""all things being equal"" but really more of a Job-like thing where Gen threw bad circumstances at Eleanor to see how she would respond.  Which not only doesn't seem fair, but is really just a more complicated version of Gen's previous test in ""The Burrito"".

And related to that, even if the simulation wasn't specifically about throwing curve balls (tortures?) at Eleanor and the others, it doesn't seem like a legit experiment if the people the leads aren't interacting with aren't the real people/are basically just NPCs.  I mean granted, I don't think that those were ""really"" Tahani's parents in her previous test, just like Eleanor's test involved a fake Chidi, but in those circumstances, it was very clear that this was a test, even if the exact test wasn't clear.

Tl; dr, it doesn't seem like a fair test to me (even by Gen's standards) and is no skin off Gen's nose, if the leads aren't in the real world and interacting with real people who can make their own choices.",19,5,False,self,,,,,

What she really needs is someone to help her to be more human , in my opinion. Someone whos kind and gentle, and doesnt care that shes not a girl (not a robot, either lol).

Even when She was really mean to him, and didnt want tell anyone aboult their relashionship, he listened to her and tried to understand. And when they discovered he was married to Janet, he said he was sorry that put her in a weird situation. That was really cute!

My theory is that the judge created a sort of bubble universe/timeline, where the 4 of them didn't die and are instead continuing their lives on Earth. This is the only way to truly test them, as simulations are imperfect and could negatively influence how they act: without truly sending them back there would always be an argument to be made that they would have acted differently if they TRULY had the chance. However, I think that once this test is done, however it ends, that this timeline will be erased/the Universe will be popped and it will revert back to the timeline where they died as they originally did. If the judge had the power to send back to earth, or to create a vast simulation, I think this is in her power as well. It would also allow for all of them to exist in the same world together, which I think makes more sense from a story telling standpoint than existing in the same simulation or being able to find and interact with fake versions of each across the fake world.

We already have evidence that time is super wonky and not necessarily linear in the afterlife.  For example, the reboots have been decades upon decades, yet Gen mentions last judging someone 30 years ago, presumably Mindy, meaning time passage in the fake good place is wonky/non linear in some way. People in the bad place also mention currently alive people still being alive, and make references to modern pop culture, etc. frequently, showing evidence that their relationship to time has little to no relationship to Earth time. This implies that a bubble universe could plausibly be created without drastically altering the afterlife universe, and possibly without directly altering it at all.

As for why Michael is able to pop in, I think this could be explained if we assume the room they are in is in the judge's realm still. There could be a portal/entrance from this realm that he could sneak into while she's busy enjoying her burrito or whatever.

As for how their test ends with this theory I'm not sure. I don't really know how to tell when the test is done in either a simulated version or a reality version. But if this is a real earth I'd imagine it ends when they die again, likely still young in a final destination type of way that the writers could wink at. But even if it's not when they're young, since it would be a bubble universe instead of the real timeline, they could still be returned to the judges quarters at the moment they left with their memories restored.",5,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

They turned everything upside down at the end of season one by revealing that we've been in the Bad Place all along, so perhaps it makes sense to expect similar twists for each season. But I don't know how often they can pull off the whole ""this isn't really the place we said it was!"" trick. That's the kind of twist you can really only use once. So unless I'm given some compelling reason to think Eleanor's return to Earth is a simulation, I'm inclined to take it at face value. 

Some say that this has to be a simulation, because hundreds of years have passed with all the reboots. But we already know that the afterlife, wherever it is, doesn't have much to do with earthly concepts of space and time. These are beings that snort time like a drug and get from place to place via interdimensional portals. Time travel, or resetting the time stream, or whatever, would seem like a pretty simple thing for them. So that doesn't mean anything.

Some people point to Chidi speaking English as a sign that they're still in the afterlife, but there's no need to assume that. Chidi's native language may be French, but he lives in Australia, so he would definitely be able to speak English anyway. So that doesn't mean anything either.

Some people have asked ""if she's really on Earth, how did Michael show up in the bar?"" The question assumes that Michael can't go to Earth for some reason, and I don't know where this assumption comes from.

I even saw somebody point to Eleanor getting sued after trying to do the right thing as evidence that the Judge (or somebody) was forking with her as part of a new test. But that's just life. Life isn't fair, and doesn't necessarily reward good behavior, whether you're in real life or a simulation.

Aside from the (I think) flimsy evidence that she's in a simulation, there are some things to suggest that she isn't. Gen seems pretty hesitant to do it, saying that it would set a bad precedent, to which Michael responds that ""it's only four people."" That's a weird exchange for them to have if it's just another simulation.

Also, from a storytelling standpoint... it would just be kinda lame. Sending the gang back to Earth is a bold step that moves the story forward. Sending the gang into another simulation is a timid step that moves the story nowhere in particular.

Is there any other evidence that I'm missing that would suggest that Eleanor is in another simulation?",40,12,False,self,,,,,

I haven't been reading a lot because I'm trying to avoid S2 spoilers so I don't know if anyone else has come to this conclusion but what if Michael is the one being tortured?

He knows he's in the Bad Place but he revels in his evil and believes he's going to revolutionize it, be some kind of hero and he's obviously quite egotistical making his failures more stinging, not to mention if he fails again (which technically he did already) he will be sentenced to eternal torment.

And just like the main(?) characters have been reset, Michael has too but maybe Michael is being reset within a reset? So while he's cognizant of the main characters' resets, he may not be aware of his own.

So in that sense (referring back to a simulation theory) the mains could be being simulated but for the purpose of torturing Michael. Or maybe the 4 humans are actually demons themselves. Or maybe they are really humans but unwitting and unaware that Michael is the true torture target.

That would also give the show's writers quite a lot of leeway for a big twist to build off and perhaps another story arc.

At the till, the cashier asks her if she has any big plans for the weekend.  Eleanor replies ""Yep, gonna sit alone in my house, watching wedding fails on Youtube, drinking margaritas through a Twizzler straw until I pass out on top of my vibrator"".  The scene ends with her outside arguing with the environmental activist and subsequently the death.

&amp;nbsp;

Pretty boring, mundane weekend, right?

&amp;nbsp;

In the season finale of Season 2, we see Eleanor being sent back to the point of her death, only this time to be saved.  She then embarks on an attempt to live a righteous life.

&amp;nbsp;

After a while of trying to be good, she ends up at a bar (Sting's Desert Rose) with her friend.  She relays to another patron that today is her birthday and that on her last birthday she almost died, implying that its been one year since the ""I almost just died"" moment.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the thing:  In the original ""version"" she gave no impression, whatsoever, to the cashier that it was her birthday.  Her reply to the question ""So, big plans for the weekend?"" implies that its just another day.  However, in the ""version"" where she is sent back to Earth, it is implied that **that** day was her birthday.

Basically, Tahani was absolutely messed up by her parents. Her parents, I think, are becoming the 'Dolores Umbridge' of the series. They gave her a massive inferiority complex and clearly didn't care about the damage that they caused.

And for Jason, he is kind of 'dumb', but he also has a lot of insight and great deduction skills (when he *isn't* trying). But he also grew up in a horrible environment with pretty awful people around him. Naturally, he grew into a petty criminal and a Jaguars fan.

With Eleanor, you see that she, too, never stood a chance. She was working two part-time jobs in middle school to support herself from two neglectful-at-best parents. She emancipated herself at... 14?! No wonder she turned into an angry, bitter and isolated (even when surrounded by others) woman.

And the system doesn't take that into account. It's cold, unfeeling and unsympathetic to the situations that humans find themselves in.

And I thought to myself: Is the system representative of us?

How many mean and damaged people have we met and thought ""Oh, wow, I hope you burn in hell, jacksass..."" because we see someone at their worst, or just dismiss them as a criminal, or a petty woman or a narcissistic monster with legs for days.

At what age do we stop being sympathetic to a broken child? Because broken and hurt children grow into broken and hurt adults, and not every adult has the support systems to overcome their traumas.

But we judge them just as harshly. We expect them to overcome those traumas no matter what. Why? At what age do we just expect them to 'get on with it' and lose all empathy for damaged persons?

Well, sort of, but not really.

So, I'm not sure how much I buy into the overall idea of Michael as a stand-in for Michael Schur, but there's definitely something meta early in the second season in Vicky/Denise being a demanding actor and Michael being the director trying to rein her in.  

With that in mind, I think that Schur might have been indirectly commenting on the Chidi language/accent issue by having Denise want to use the Australian accent she meticulously practiced, which turns out to be a very exaggerated Crocodile Dundee style accent, especially because while in-universe, the Australian accent could have been a way to manipulate Chidi since he lived there, out of universe, it explains why Harper doesn't use either a Senegalese/French accent or an Australian accent as Chidi- Because it would be inauthentic, just like Vicky/Denise's Australian accent.

And as I was thinking about this post, I also recalled that during the first season, as the ""Real Eleanor"", Vicky/Denise is supposed to have been born abroad (I believe in India) and learned to speak English with a generic accent watching Seinfeld.  Tiya Sircar (and I guess Vicky/Denise) somehow manages to make this believable, but I can see how this also comments on the Chidi accent issue, by giving a rather outlandish explanation for a character speaking English ""without an accent"", but somehow managing to make it believable.

Tl; dr, Vicky/Denise is Schur's way of telling us that Chidi is never going to speak in anything but a standard American accent.",16,2,False,self,,,,,

I just had to say something about the end of season 1. I LOVE that close up shot of Michael's face for the big reveal.  Ted Danson does an amazing job with his facial expressions.  With just a change of his face he flips the whole show upside down for the audience.  

We had spent the whole season getting to know him as a loveable goofball. Then when Eleanor tells them her theory of where they actually are, we chuckle, this is just a silly joke the writers threw in, surely.  And then we see Michael's face, he looks as puzzled as we feel, classic joke structure.  Have a character say something stupid, and then have one of the more serious characters react to it.  Not the funniest joke in the show, but it's moving the scene along.

Then the camera stays on Michael's face, and we slowly see him transform from a trusted friend to someone we don't even recognize!  This most evil grin spreads across his face, and he cackles out an almost inhuman laugh.  

It was seriously one of the creepiest things I've seen.  I've never seen someone look more like what I imagine the devil would look like.  And with just a smile the whole dynamic of this character, and the whole show, changes.

I don't know how else to put how much I love this shot, one of the best reveal shots I've seen on TV let alone a half hour comedy!  I can't stop seeing it in my head days after the fact.

This is the first part of a series of posts I will be doing on understanding the philosophy presented in the show. For more information/comments, please view [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7ygqyu/would_people_on_here_be_interested_in_a_short/?st=JDUO212V&amp;sh=d61e8959)

Also, please feel free to ask questions about anything I presented here. The plan is to do a three part series: one as background, one on Scanlon, and one on the implications of the philosophy on the show itself. But I am more than happy to do more on, say, The Trolley Problem. Just ask/comment below! 

Before I begin talking about Scanlon, I think it is necessary to define a couple of key terms: 

Ethics the motivating rules that guide our actions

When most people think about ethics, they think about what is right and wrong. But philosophers see ethics more like a GPS; it tells us where to go and re routes when we fuck up. To be right, then, is to follow the GPS and to be wrong is to not follow it. This is where we get the term moral compass. 

The key word here is motivating. If our ethical codes cant motivate us to follow them, then they fail altogether. Therefore, whatever system we use to act upon, whatever rules we choose to follow, is our code of ethics and sets our moral compass. 

Ethical to act in accordance with moral rules 

Moral philosophers are often concerned with the concept of consistency. Being inconsistent with your moral rules is literally the definition of being unethical. 

Ethical Theory The set of rules that motivate our actions 

Ok this is where things get going! Ethical theories are simply the interpretations of what the moral rules entail. A few of them have been discussed on the show, consequentialism and deontology (which we will get to in a moment). But in order to show how an ethical theory works, Im going to make up one.

In honor of Jason Mendoza, I present Bortlesology! 

There are two main components to most normative (that just means motivating) ethical theories. I will use Bortlesology to show each of them. 

1. Whether it is ends based or means based. 

An ethical theory is ends based if it cares about the consequences of actions, the results of the rules. If Bortlesology were to be an ends based system, it would say that the right action is to best serve the interests of Blake Bortles. It would not care if we intended to help Blake Bortles and failed, only if we actually did help Blake Bortles by say giving him ice cream or teaching him to throw the football better. 

An ethical theory is means based if it cares about our intentions or reasons for action. In this case, if we acted in accordance with Blake Bortles moral laws and had good reason to act in accordance with those laws (because hes got a super dope name or some shit that Jason would say), then we would be an ethical person.

2. Whether it is agent neutral or agent relative 

An ethical theory is agent neutral if it does not care who is performing the action that is being questioned, where everyone has the same value and obligations. In the case of Bottlesology, it wouldnt matter who had access to Blake Bortles or was friends with Blake Bortles or was an enemy with Blake Bortles, it only matters if one actually goes about following the moral rules of Blake Bortles, whoever you may be. 

An ethical theory is agent relative if the ethics change based on who you are and what your worth in context of the action in question is. If Bortlesology is an agent relative theory, then considerations like access to Blake Bortles or being friends him would determine your duty to help Blake Bortles. 

Alas, Bortlesology is not a real theory, but it may help you understand two very important ones.

Consequentialism is an ends-based, agent neutral theory. Its basic thesis is that the right action will produce good consequences, namely maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, and that EVERYONE has this obligation (hence being agent neutral). The most common kind of consequentialism is utilitarianism, which states that promotion of pleasure and reduction of pain apply to everyone in society not just certain individuals. So, donating to charity is the right thing to do because it it produces good results for everyone affected, including the giver who may feel good about him or herself for giving. 

The best example in the show of consequentialism is Eleanor in season one, when she realizes she is not the real Eleanor. She realizes that lying about her identity is actually a good thing because it maximizes her own pleasure. She may be mistaken about that pleasures relation to everyone else in the neighborhood, but what the other three humans come to realize is that her pleasure is also beneficial to their pleasure (i.e. they enjoy hanging out with her).

The biggest advantage of consequentialism is that it seems to justify immoral things for the greater good. Lying, under most ethical theories, is always wrong. But, if you were hiding Jewish people in your house and a Nazi comes to your door, consequentialism would say that lying about your hiding of the Jewish people is in fact the ethical thing to do. Or, in the case
of the trolley problem, killing one person is better than letting five die. Therefore, consequentialism appeals to our common sense despite its counterintuitive way of disregarding intentions and reasons.

Deontology or Kantianism is a means based, agent relative ethical theory. Its thesis is that morality is based on our justifications of our actions based on universal moral laws (such as the categorical imperative or the Golden rule). It does not care about the practical implications of our actions or how they affect people in the real world, only about what, in theory, we ought to do. It is agent relative because it recognizes that people have different duties to say their family members or their religion and that is what creates justification for actions.

Chidi is of course the best example of a deontologist on the show. He realizes that even a basic thing like drinking almond milk needs sufficient justification before it is done. 

The biggest advantage to deontology is seems most consistent with our reasons for acting ethically in the first place. Ethics are valuable in themselves, not for some greater good. We need to respect each other and ourselves before we can begin to act at all.

In case you were interested, its answer to the trolley problem is simple: the reason why letting five people die is better than killing one is because of the act/omission distinction. To omit from acting, to have no reason to act, is not something that we can be ethically held accountable for, because we decided not to do anything about it! Were we to act and kill the one person, we would be violating the very universal moral laws that caused us to have respect for human life at all. If we respect that one person on the track as a human being, it is our obligation never to kill them, regardless of the circumstance. 

And you may be wondering, what does any of this have to do with Scanlon? For hundreds of years, philosophers were debating consequentialism vs deontology to no end... until Scanlon came along. Scanlon invented a new kind of ethical system one that is both means based AND ends based, both agent neutral AND agent relative!

How did he do it? Thats what Ill get into for Part 2. Please leave questions and comments below! Thanks!

**Dax Shepard** (Chet) ran the TV production studio where Andys Johnny Karate show was filmed. (*corrected - thanks to pretyy_vacant*)

**Will McLaughlin** was a Pawnee cop in P&amp;R, and a Jacksonville cop in TGP.

**Jim Meskinen** was the Master of Ceremonies at several Pawnee events including the Correspondents' Lunch, and played basically the same role at the Bad Place museum.

**Eugene Cordero** (Pillboi) officiates at Garry's funeral in the Parks &amp; Rec finale.

**Mary Holland**: this is a difficult one to spot. In The Good Place she plays Paula, the woman who ends up with a ""bulbous"" dog after entrusting its care to Eleanor.

&gt; **Eleanor** Well, my first rule would be that no one can veto my rules.

&gt; **Chidi** Well, that's called tyranny. And it's generally frowned upon.

From Eleanor's very first rant in episode 1 it was plausible that the show might end with the establishment of a ""Medium Place"" for Eleanor. For people who weren't murderers, but weren't forkin' Ghandi.

And season 2 literally ended with Michael storming in to tell the judge that it just might be possible that the entire system by which they judge and torture humans could be wrong.

So there's plenty of reason to believe that the uprooting of the current system is the endgame for the show.

But adding to that fire is this conversation. ""What We Owe To Each Other"" has been significantly important to the show twice already. In finales of both seasons, in fact. And this exchange in episode 6 is the books' introduction.

In every reboot she knows that she doesn't belong in the good place and tries her best to be a better person so she had a lot of time to prepare for when the time for testing came around.

But the other 3:


* Jason: he also had a chance and he showed improvement but its very clear that he need a special class for him, he is very dumb and doesn't seem to learn the same way most people do, he is very childlike so he would definitely need a different way of learning how to be a better person.
 

* Tahani: she is always mislead into believing she belongs in the good place and that validates everything she did in her life, she never has a reason to believe she is not a good person or her action did not matter because of her motivations, and the moment she finds out she is in the bad place she gets get memory erased, her chances of learning and improving are very slim, therefore, she failed her test.


* Chidi: he is also led to believe he is in the good place, and on top of that, Eleanor and Jason learn from him, he is doing a lot of good in the bad place BUT none intentionally for himself, and while helping others is a good thing, he is not aware of the things that put him in the bad place until is too late (like Tahani) and while Eleanor helps him, he is not aware he is making mistakes by making everybody around him miserable with his indecisiveness (and this is not taking into account the serious mental issue he seems to have that makes him so anxious and indecisive).

So yes, Eleanor passed and its great for her it shows their effort is well worth it, but the was the only one who had a chance to really ""study"" for it 

I think it will be interesting to see what the writers do with this, and in what ways will they give the others a chance to improve that suits them, and allows them to really belong in the real good place.     ",30,56,False,self,,,,,

I always thought the joke was just that Derek was a badly-made imitation of a human being, but I think there's an underlying consistency there:

Janet has a type.

She was trying to get over being in love with Jason, and what does she create? An unstoppable moron with a short attention span and an aggressively friendly attitude. Just like many humans in real life, Janet's found a rebound guy who is basically just her original partner with a few superficial qualities tweaked or exaggerated.

Am I the only one who didn't put this together? I think I just fell even more in love with this show.",29,415,False,self,,,,,
