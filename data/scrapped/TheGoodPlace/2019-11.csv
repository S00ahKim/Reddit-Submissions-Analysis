3,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2019-11-1,2019,11,1,9,dpwwcp,self.TheGoodPlace,Season 4: Wild speculation about where this ends up,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/dpwwcp/season_4_wild_speculation_about_where_this_ends_up/,wtfhfx,1572568911,"Rewatching S3:E10 right now. And I have a wild guess about where the show ends up.

The gang arrives in TGP Post Office. The first thing each of them does when they meet an actual Good Place employee is lie. Within the moral framework of the show, that's a no-no--it's been shown multiple times that lying to get what you want doesn't work and will have consequences.

Maybe TGP employees are naive--but I bet the Accountants aren't. When the current exercise is over at the end of this season, my bet is this: 

The four humans are told that the experiment was a success, and the rules will be changing forthwith. But... the moment the humans got to TGP, they had the chance to be honest, and selfishly chose not to. Which counts against them, obviously, and leaves their scores hovering in a neutral zone. So they're given a choice between TMP and eternal blandness but no torture, or being put in charge of their own neighbourhoods to help everyone else get to TGP--but they never, ever get to go there themselves. And of course our gang has grown and evolved and learned about empathy and so they all voluntarily give up the easy option, because the right thing to do is help everyone else get there. 

My guess is based on the fact that if the show wraps up with an unambiguous They All Go To TGP The End thing, it'll be disappointing and obvious. What the show has kinda hammered all along is that being good/ethical isn't a goal or an end state, it's a process; the moment you think you've deserved TGP, you automatically exclude yourself from it, you have to keep working. Also, I think at this point the show is being sincere--Michael, Gen, and Shawn are all who they appear to be. So there isn't going to be some giant Surprise This Was A Simulation All Along You Passed kinda thing either.

And the show can't demand its high level of investment from the audience, then just send the gang to literal hell. That would be insane. So it has to be somewhere between the two extremes, and here's the real dongbuster: the only way for them to do the right thing is to have TGP denied to them forever, because if they know they're helping people get into heaven so they can get in themselves, then they're seeking moral dessert and thus won't deserve it.

I think the show has several large themes it has to pay off, and I think this is likely the only way to get them all.

TLDR: the series ends with our four humans voluntarily giving up TGP to spearhead the new project of helping everyone get there instead of just punishing them. 

Does this make sense?",4,29,False,spoiler,,,,,

She always has a trick up her sleeve to save everyone when needed, she facilitates a lot of the situations where the characters grow and move towards becoming better, she's everywhere (even hell, which does conflict with Christian theology, but that's the only sticking point I can think of).  She knows everything, she can do seemingly anything, except when she perhaps pretends not to be able to, to move the other characters forward.  She's not human, not a demon, not a woman, etc.  Even when they were in her ""void"", the other characters didn't really ""know"" her; they saw pieces of her, but didn't become her.  But the characters took on her ""image"" (as in, man made in the image of God).  She's unknowable.  Knows everything, all powerful, unfathomable.  I think the writers would have a hard time reconciling the existence of this character, with all the attributes of ""God"", if she ISN'T God.  And conveniently,  Michael is her instrument for pulling off this particular act of intervention, just as Michael is the archangel who fights God's battles in Christian theology.

In this episode Michael talked about trying to be a little better today than yesterday. That theme was highlighted a couple times. Im not sure how the experiment will conclude, but I think it will lead to a redesign of the points system in which humans fates are decided not by a required total, but simply whether or not most days they were/did better than the one before. It allows for people to screw up, but then to reflect and do better. 

But then the twist: They use this new system going forward from here, but because of Jeremy Bearimy, there is no forward direction in the afterlife. The effects of the new system will loop back around on themselves and eventually the whole story weve seen wont actually happen in the same way weve seen it, because the new system prevents it from occurring that way.

Maybe our beloved main characters will get to be reborn and be judged by the new system. And again, because of Jeremy Bearimy and other weird afterlife magic, maybe they could be reborn as their original same selves, into their same lives, on their original birth dates. The so sad but so perfect ending weve heard about would fit: its sad because they lose each other and their shared relationships and experiences, but perfectly hopeful because they get another shot and all of humanity has a real shot finally as well. Or maybe they decide to have them all born in the same place and time, etc., to facilitate them finding each other in their new lives on earth. Maybe theyre even born to a group of families who are already friends.

Its not a fully formed theory, obviously... just some things Im wondering about. Im dying (ha) to see how it will end. Whatever it is, I hope we get a really kickass goodbye party with the crew.

I believe that this fact won't ruin the experiment, but give the bad place a reason to exist.     
Hear me out, a few demons have already switched over to the ""maybe humans can be good"", but if that were true for all humans, then there'd be no reason to even have a bad place.  It even seems like many of the demons enjoy torturing humans because they believe that humans lived an evil exitance.    


I feel that the judge would say that due to the fact that Chidi, Simone, and John have changed for the better, then that would mean that good humans can and will work together to do better.  However on the other hand, some people, like Brent,  are bad, don't want to change, and those are the people that deserve to be in the bad place.    


I'm gonna go a step farther to think that they will possibly even build a world where they take people from the bad place, wipe their memory, and test them (just like they are doing now) to see where they end up.

He is described at utterly horrible and others on this subreddit have even questioned whether he can be saved. He is meant to be an ashhole character, but I think he's been written worse. 

I don't think he's been written like a human. 

Through the first episode, he's decently consistent, but quite rude. He's a caricature yes (and some might argue a strawman), but he's still a human. One that has had everything go right for him and has thus been spoiled. But after his chaos sequence in episode 2, it stops making sense. He sees the clear destruction obviously due to his presence and interprets it as him deserving more. I can't imagine an adult human coming to that conclusion so immediately. 

In all of his time on the show, he's either straight up rude, or he does something to make it seem like he's developing only to quickly renack on it. 

I don't understand how his character is being written. In the podcast, all the actors insist that they've met people like Brent in real life. That doesn't make sense, at least not to me. Obnoxious ashholes do exist, but someone that when learning they don't belong in heaven would think they belong in super heaven is just inconceivable to me.

maybe the Judge and this whole experiment is another form of torture by The Bad Place like the original humans arent exactly happy and havent been for a very long time. this could just be a really elaborate form of torture. theyre under so much stress and they cant possibly have another oh my god this is the bad place! moment like they did in the initial scenarios

I mean, it wasn't hilariously bad, it was *aggravatingly* bad that I had to skip some minutes. It was obvious that Brent would deny that his book was bad, we expected that much. 

But I didn't expect him to go into a *rage* mode.

The line ""I finally ACCOMPLISHED something and you guys trash it!""(Not exactly verbatim, can't remember it) stuck me and made me think that deep inside, Brent knows that he was handed over everything in his life with little to no effort, and it crippled his self worth that he lived to mask it with an excessively irritating attitude   and psychological projection onto others to the point that he really believes that he a competent and good person. And when he finally did something on his own only to face backlashes(regardless of its quality), he went ballistic because it was perhaps one of his few, if not the first ever, attempt to do his authentic job. In short, he is a mix of Eleanor's negative aspect - being a jerk to divert herself from her own emptiness - and Tahani's negative aspect - highly privileged life that dissociates her from ""normal"" people. 

That's not to say that Brent can necessarily be a good person. It's not uncommon at all that people harbor jealousy to those of privileged backgrounds - for right or wrong reasons - but not all of those people get free rides to get what they want. IN fact, I know a lot of such people in my life that work hard *especially* because of ""oh you are given things for free"" criticisms. Instead, Brent went to an opposite direction and spent his life in denial and undeserved comfort.

Well, I suppose he told her the story verbally, but we saw the flashbacks.

As of *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*, we know that flashbacks as a story-telling device don't have to be accurate. Glenn's version of events was speculation, but it looked the same as a normal flashback.

Why couldn't they have Michael's story be a bit more, well, subjective? Like, if anyone would be a fun, unreliable narrator, it's him. Just have everyone act a little bit exaggerated, give Janet an angelic glow, have Eleanor swear like a sailor all the time while she's away from the new humans. Give Chidi and Jason overbites as a The X-Files reference.

It's not even that important if that story's even actually true or not, because next week's ep takes place six months after this one. The Brent thing is just a hiccough that's gonna be forgotten about by then. Michael could have made it up because Bad Janet needed to hear something like it, and he needed an excuse to give her that book. But there's no indication that it's an exaggaration/fabrication, and I think it would have been a lot more fun if there was. Not to the point of unbelievability, like Michael winning that Hotness Contest 25 weeks running, but something.

Do the new humans need to get exponentially better than they were? Do they need to improve just a little? We see that most of the humans improved a least a little. John, for example, was able to not spill the beans about Jason. That definitely doesn't make him a good person but it does show a little improvement over his past behavior. Would that be enough? Do architects/judge/demons/etc think that everyone who goes to the bad place is a bad person all the time regardless of the circumstances and similarly for the good place? No one can be consistently and always  good or bad but we also saw that Doug Forcett had over a million points and still wouldn't make it to the good place.

I liked the last episode when Michael argued that it doesn't matter if we are good or bad only if we are trying to be better than we were yesterday and I think he'll probably argue that to the judge at the end of the experiment. The humans probably did not earn enough points to get in the good place but they all improved a little. Perhaps the system will change where instead of looking at your total  points they'll be looking at points over time. Like looking at a graph and seeing if the line has an upward trend giving people who didn't have enough time to earn points a chance!

Of God / Eleanor?

Meanwhile, on The Good Place, God is an ever-evolving figure whose qualities are currently embodied by Eleanor (Kristen Bell), a semi-reformed sinner struggling to take on the herculean task of rehabbing fellow residents damned to The Bad Place.

This is not really accurate as the show has never said there is a capital G god. 

I think the closest it has comes is when Michael starts reading Janets manual: Hello and welcome to your new Janet. Janets are brought to you by the makers of light, darkness, and everything.

So thus far, The Good Place has posited a group of makers rather than a monotheistic deity in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Of course, the Makers could report to an as-yet-unmentioned boss, but Im just going off whats been said up till now.

So I was thinking about why his experiences have failed to result in personal growth.

Chidis ethics lessons focused a lot on Kant, since that was what he studied as a professor, but I think the shows philosophy takes a fair bit from other philosophers too, particularly the ancient Greeks. For example, the idea of getting better being more important than being good is something I remember as being a sort of Aristotolean thing, because Aristotle beleived that virtues were skills, not traits, and people who were not virtuous should be thought of as people who needed help and training, not evil.

Another common greek idea was that of hubris and anagnorisis. Hubris being your fatal flaw that brings a out your ironic downfall, and anagnorisis being the revelation if the truth of your faults.

This comes into play with the original 4. When Michael intervenes to try and make them better, he does so by saving their lives, but specifically their lives are saved from a scenario that mirrors their worst attributes. Eleanor dies because she stands around tearing down someone else trying to be good rather than try herself. Chidi dies because he is characteristically paralyzed with indecision. Jason dies because he makes a poor rash decision without thinking of the consequences. Tahani dies because she is toppled a statue out of envy toward her sister.

In all of these cases, the humans are forced to confront their own failings and how they had lead to near fatal harm to themselves. And this is what leads to introspection. 

Eleanor, who was made aware from the start that she did not belong in the good place, had to grapple with the fact that every lesson in Ethics from Chidi was a way she failed to be good in life. So every lesson she got resulted in anagnorisis, a revelation. The modified attempt at this on Brent failed because he had it confirmed to him that he WAS a good person. He was unable to confront that his behaviors were wrong because he was already told they were right. 

Later, when they try a more ""direct"" approach, he is being presented with his flaws by an external personality, in this case, Simone. And as such, he does not see his failings presented to him as objective truths evidenced by incontrovertible events, but as opinions from another person. Opinions which conflict with his own, and which damage his sense of identity. As such, he defensively rejects them, because why would he value some other persons subjective evaluations over his own? Particularly evaluations which are harmful to him?

I think the key to changing people in the experiment is forcing them to confront the parts of themselves they need to change by putting them in situations where their own  negative behaviors result in bad consequences for the neighborhood. For example, gossip guy will inevitably crack and tell someone about Jason, and the group will enact some kind of consequence to that that will make him see the true harm that his obsessive gossip can cause. Chidi will have to make some snap judgement to save Jason, but will fail to do so in time. Simone.... well I still dont know what her ""problem"" is so who knows.",20,40,False,self,,,,,

But I wanted to gain your perspective on it because we are, rightly or wrongly, as a society ready to cancel anyone who participated in blackface.  Ted Danson was very controversially not only a participant, but also used the n-word multiple times, and defended himself by saying that the comedy club was known for outrageous comedy, and that newcomers werent used to it. 

I believe that people are capable of change and this show - more so than others - really drives that point home. I also think we now live in an age where people are more educated in the historical context of this, and the idea that their actions have consequences and can be exposed on an international stage at the press of a button. With that being said, Danson did this whilst in a relationship with Whoopi Goldberg, within a decade of her gaining international recognition for the film The Color Purple - a film that is extremely racially inquisitive.  

I guess my question is: whilst I know why I can move past this, I wonder why other people have done the same. In particular, I suppose I wonder why this hasnt come back to attack him in the way a similar incident did with Trudeau, or why people are so ready to attack the Kardashians/Jenners, Paula Deen, etc etc. What about Ted Danson is different? Why has he slipped under the radar, or been let off for this, when so many people arent?

Example: It's 6 PM. You start heading towards the grocery store. When you get there, it's 5:30 PM. Even though you progressed, time itself moved back, thus you technically arrived at the store before you started going there.

Chidi feels half present now, the new characters like Brent are really hard to watch, and just as a whole, it seems like seasons 1-3 were a solid 100 and now out of nowhere, with so much anticipation, in the final season because they want to end it as they want on their grand vision and not drag it out, it surprisingly all feels ... meh.

I loved seeing his bad side in season 2. In both seasons, we saw he was equally fascinated by humans (e.g. karaoke, paperclips, suspenders, etc) and disgusted by them (e.g. ""gross little mouths and stupid elbows""). And it was cool to see him reform, even if I did find it slightly rushed. Over time, Michael went from God figure to antagonist to friend. 

However, I find the character rather boring now that all his sharp edges have been sanded off. He's cuddly and full of inspirational speeches and we don't really see any Bad Place upbringing in him anymore. No contrasts or contradictions. I mean, he was a demon for most of eternity, it would be interesting to see him occasionally struggle with shaking a cruel tendency or a bad thought or habit. Or even just showing that he still understands the way demons think, because he's been there. For example, in the last episode, when Bad Janet used a metaphor about humans vomiting on a bus, he hesitated to confirm that he understood it. But why wouldn't he? He used to think in these kinds of metaphors, too. He might be the only being who *gets* both Good Place and Bad Place ways of thinking.

Now Michael seems almost totally assimilated into the human group. He doesn't have anything bad in him and his childish enthusiasm for human activities is gone. This doesn't give Ted Danson much to work with - he can only pull from the same bag of tricks for so long before I find Good Michael to be cloying and sappy (which I do at this point).

I was excited to see Vicky using the Michael suit because it provided an opportunity to see Michael's bad side again (which is very entertaining) without reversing the real Michael's character development. But it wasn't used much. I did enjoy the late game revelation that Michael's true form is a 6000 ft fire squid.

So, one thing I've been thinking about is when Sean is doing his presentation he mentions that humans got used to their torture and he came up with a new innovative way to torture them. I recently made the connection to hedonic adaptation, (basically no matter the positives or negatives in people's lives we will always revert back to the state of happiness we were in before) now I don't completely understand how the real good place works but I'm betting to bargain that it would work with relatively the same structure we've seen the show work (i.e. Still functioning as humans). With having the afterlife be perfectly catered to the humans, but eventually it would be the same thing and get boring. It also made me think that the medium place could be the worst torture, maybe not purposefully, but Mindy was so close to ending up in the good place that she's stuck in an eternity of torture knowing full well she came so close to being in the good place. While people in the good place become numb of their lives and are trapped in an eternity of mediocrity, because their perfect paradise is no longer ideal, they've been there and done that.

If they did, how accurate was Michael's retelling to Bad Janet? 

They made a big deal about Chip Driver solving the mystery on page 10, what was probably the first 1% of the book given how thick it was. Is the mystery this episode solvable within the first 1% of the episode?

Maybe. 

They're in Janet's void, which has been a (non)place that prior to this, has been shown to allow cursing (S3E10 ""Janet(s)"", in which the word ""bitchin'"" is clearly stated by a human inside Janet's void.

In this episode, Bad Janet starts off by immediately saying a ""good placed"" curse. 

Could be a mistake no one in production caught, but could also be an indication that Bad Janet is not actually in Good Janet's void. Why is this relevant? Well, if Bad Janet is somewhere in The Medium Place operating under the rules of a ""Good Place"", why the subterfuge? 

Because the entire episode is a facade. The events of A Chip Driver Mystery may have happened, but it's much more likely that the end result was different. Michael did in fact put on his big boy demon pants, but not to ""kill"" Bad Janet. He is manipulating her in some end game maneuver that we don't yet know about.

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of the story being told is very highly likely to be a Michael machination, which would be in line with his actions so far this season. He's a reformed demon, but he's made several mistakes this season that show he's not as far along on his reformation as he'd like everyone to believe. It could have to do with the relative success or failure of the experiment at this point in time, giving Bad Janet an incomplete or totally fictitious look at what's going on, or it could have to do with Michael needing to find some additional leverage against The Bad Place by sowing discord among their ranks and possibly using the book as a revolution tool (or perhaps a spying/scrying device to get a leg up on TBP).

It could also just be a huge red herring to throw people off. This season has buried twists within twists in a much shorter timeframe versus previous seasons, and to head off the people who think they're so forking smart, it could just be enough rope to hang ourselves by.

But it could also be the setup to a brilliant Michael maneuver in his ongoing effort to ensure the afterlives of not just his four humans, but all of humanity.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Eleanor's test was about her selfishness which she passed when she brought Chidi and Simone back together at the cost of her own happiness.


Tahani's test was about her vanity and obsession with status by becoming friends with someone who ridiculed her to the masses AND learning that she doesn't need to be center stage for this mission.

* Mindy would eventually spill the beans about Eleanor and Chidi, making Simone furious, confused, or even more convinced that this is all a forked-up hallucination.

Each one of the new subjects are kinda a counter-part of one of the originals

Eleanor = Brent

Someone that shouldn't be on the good place, Brent is worse than season one Eleanor, but booth had the same problem they didn't though about other people.


John = Jason and Tahani 

Poor control of his impulses like Jason , kinda vainly and looking to be accepted like Tahani, again not exactly the same but their problems have the same root


Simone = Chidi 


They live by a code, Chidi can't act because of his morals and inadvertently cause harm to others because of if, Simone think like a scientist she is logical almost to a fault like when she hurts Chidi sentiments by the end of the episode


Well Chidi = Chidi and he is a central piece on why the first experiment worked and why this second one should work except



The inicial conditions weren't the same, the first neighbor was a torture for the humans, Eleanor and Jason knew they weren't supposed to be in the good place since the first moment, and because of that they looked for help in becoming a better person


This second neighbor isn't the same, it's not a torture, or at least not designed to be all of the humans think they deserve to be in the good place they have no desire to be better, to change, and like Simone said in this episode, if you run the same experiment with the same conditions you get the same results, but the conditions aren't the same, so the subjects will not have the same results, in some cases it worked for a while like with John, but in others like Brent we have no result, and they didn't even try to change Simone. 


And I think that is the reason Brent only appears to change in the last second, when Chidi confronts him and say it out loud you are not a good person, this is hell, and that realization may change him, or not but it's the first time he is confronted with the truth and start to think about himself. 


Maybe the new system will be like a second chance to everyone, you get to be better if you want, they will have thousand of neighborhoods testing each human and seeing if they want to improve, but they need to understand they weren't good and want to change for it to work

To start with, we had Glenn who tried to help humans (if we assume he really was on human's side). We know demons can reform (look at Michael), so it's not impossible. 

We also learnt that Bad Janet has been rebooted 40 million times, which makes her the most advanced Janet ever. Good Janet was rebooted approximately 827 times and she developed feelings and abilities unheard of in Janets. That means Bad Janet might be now capable of understanding that the system is wrong and needs reform. We actually got whole episode about Michael trying to convince Bad Janet that humans can get better and I'm sure Michael giving Bad Janet their Manifesto was one of the most important scene this season. 

Lastly, we have Michael's speech in Bad Place when he tried to convince other demons to his point of view. I believe some demons will start to get second thoughts about what they're doing and with the Manifesto and Bad Janet they will overthrow Bad Place upper management.

So what's gonna happen now? We left on cliffhanger but I think humans will fail the experiment, they might even get to the Bad Place on the next episode.

Her initial hypothesis had even been that they were part of an experiment, that they were being tested. Brent confirmed that it was a test. She'd been encouraged time and time again throughout the year to be nice to people no matter what. And yeah, her afterlife experience was sub-par compared to actual heaven, but how do you get ""This is hell"" from that when ""this is purgatory"" is so, so close?

Abandoning Brent had been a bad decision, ethically and strategically. If she knows that they were being tested, she should have tried to ace the test. If she thinks they're already in hell, she should wonder why she's there, rather than judge who gets to try and escape it with her and who doesn't. Like, I get that her actions are partly fueled by fear, because the worst of them has been swallowed by a hellhole and who knows who's next, there's only a few more minutes until the countdown ends, and Chidi doesn't want to leave. But her argument for abandoning Brent doesn't make sense: If they are all in hell being tortured, it doesn't matter that Brent is irredeemable. If the goal of the neighborhood is to test their souls, she should at minimum not try to talk Chidi out of helping someone. And if, for some reason, she thought the whole experiment was just about making Brent into a better person (using already good people to help), she'd have no reason to be scared about the countdown going to zero. 

I don't understand why Chidi respects Simone's position. Understands it, yes, because he's lived with fear a lot. He can also agree with her that people should be punished for their bad deeds (after all, he thinks he deserves TBP for drinking almond milk). But again, this makes Simone a hypocrite because she's running away from her punishment, after arguing that Brent deserves his.",64,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Although I'm starting to wonder if either the Good Place or Bad Place are even real. 

We've only briefly seen the real ""good place,"" but the whole scene was simply to showcase that the angels don't care about the plight of humans, and offer Eleanor a chance to try breaking in on her own. It was a place of empty temptation offering no freebies. The Bad Place was more or less a sort of Dragons Den, an obstacle on their journey where they witnessed true hatred. The Neutral Zone was simply a place for them to get answers about the perceived order of the universe. The whole afterlife seems to be a response to the question: Who's helping us? The answer: Only yourselves. And in all of this, we haven't seen literally any humans besides the main two gangs (who have all just been test subjects for this plot) and Mindy (although I might have some doubts about her). You'd think we'd actually see some in the Bad Place being publicly tortured, but it seems to be all talk. 

I'm wondering if the entire afterlife that they're in might be a ""neighborhood"" of sorts. This construct of a ""good place, bad place, neutral place, etc"" and how the system operates seems to be perfectly tailored to help these humans become better people, so maybe that's exactly what it is. It's their personal version of the afterlife that they need to journey through. 

Their journey also seems to mirror Simone's description of humanity and how we move past the roadblocks of ""me vs. us"", ""us vs. them"" etc. 

Members of the gang individually want to better themselves so they can stay in the afterlife. Noble perhaps, but ultimately selfish. They grow trust and love in each other, and by the end of season 2 they reach the conclusion ""I don't want paradise if it's not with my friends"" (moved past me vs. us). Then, in trying to get past the system, they learn how fundamentally screwed the system is, and take it upon themselves to selflessly help others, to the point where they decide that they need to undermine a corrupt afterlife and make sure that all of humanity is treated fairly (wayyy past us vs. them). 

Where they are now, they've all gone on an incredible journey to become the best that a human can be: someone who stands up to corruption and fights tooth and nail to say ""anyone can become a better person."" They've grown past their character flaws (Eleanor became selfless, Chidi can make the hardest of decisions, Tahani can befriend and forgive those who have wronged her, and Jason can control his impulses enough to form coherent ideas), and now they're trying to help others do the same. 

There's no literal good place or bad place, there's just a journey you need to take.

The feel that Chidi had when Simone so casually, but determinately says ""I do not believe in soulmates"". He is so damn crushed. He started off helping her in the first place because Elanor told her that she was his soulmate. Agreed that he would have ended up helping her irrespective of that. But still, the poor lad has always been fascinated by the idea of soulmates. Even in the first season, I think he mentions, in a very joyous tone, that the fact that soulmates are real excited him a lot. From there to here, seeing him being crushed like that was really heartbreaking.    
And I think that is why he was so firm and strong when he looks Brent right in the eyes and tells him ""You are a bad person."" Very few moments when Chidi has been that strong. 
2. Which brings me to Brent. I know it is very hard to empathize with him. Especially after having noticed him stealing a look at Tahani's butt. Up until the moment Chidi says it out loud that ""This is the Bad Place"", I think he actually, truly believes that he is a Good person. Maybe that is driven by other factors. But in his world, according to what he knows, he has been good. (This kind of does not line up completely because he knew exactly what ""being good"" means when he was told about The Best Place.) Still, over the course of the year, he has been improving in his own way. But his biggest progress came in that last minute. Where in a matter of a few seconds, he realized what ACTUALLY being good is. Once Chidi gave him the reason as to why he is a bad person, he started seeing it and lost it. Almost made me cry that fella.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

SUPER SPOILERS ahead, so quit reading now if you're not caught up!

What I realized today is that not only have the Soul Squad been given the tests Gen gave them (except maybe for Eleanor, but I'll get to that), but this has caused them to develop into the human beings they were *supposed* to be in the original test.

Gen gave Chidi the test of making a simple choice, which he failed to do, toiling over it for much too long.  Tahani was given the opportunity to stop caring about what the world thought about her, which she also failed.  Jason was, well, Jason. #football #gojacksonville #bortles

Eleanor was tested to see if she would put others above herself, given the chance to take advantage of a self-serving opportunity, and she succeeded wildly.  She passed, and now she's tested with something much different and much grander.

Eleanor is now faced with the challenge of not only leading the soul squad or the new humans or even the neighborhood but essentially all of humanity.  On Earth, she was a quitter, giving up on relationships, jobs, etc. at the moment of resistance.  Even after Michael came to give her a second chance, she still gave up on the great changes she made until she saw Chidi.

I believe she's being tested with leadership, now acting as the architect and being tested to see that if, with all the problems with the new humans, she will give up again.  She's passed with flying colors, which brings me to my next point: Eleanor has become what the ""real"" Eleanor supposedly was.

When Eleanor first arrived in the neighborhood, she was told she was a human rights lawyer who fought for people that had been wrongly sentenced to the death penalty.  Eleanor is now very literally defending all of humanity from eternal torture and punishment from the ""wrong"" accusations of the point system.

Jason was told he was a Buddhist monk, a symbol of self-mastery and wisdom. He has now moved away from knee-jerk reactions and Molotov cocktails to careful, thoughtful actions and, in many cases, great wisdom, no matter the source of the metaphors.  He is now the model of control and wisdom for the Soul Squad.

Chidi was asked to be Eleanor's philosophical teacher, helping her make correct choices - choices he was never really able to make himself.  When placed in a situation of stress and urgency, Chidi never failed to crumble under the pressure.  He has now been asked to make major choices under the clock, and he hasn't wavered in his ability to make the right choice at the right time, just like he taught Eleanor to do.

Lastly, Tahani was built up as a caretaker of the first neighborhood, hosting parties to serve the needs of others.  She did this in Earth life as well, but her motives were always corrupted - she did everything to affect the way others would view her, despite the nature of whatever cause she was supporting.  She has now made the transition to doing things for others for their sakes rather than her own glory or validation, which is what she had always thought she had done.

Schur and Co. have to this point bookended the show just as they began - with our perceived conception of what the Soul Squad should have been to enter The Good Place, only this time, they have actually become who they were supposed to be.  Quite an incredible arc.",29,1,False,self,,,,,

SPOILERS AHEAD

So, after this episode, I was impressed but also had many questions. Here are some of them.

1. How does Simone know Eleanor and Michael only spend time with the six of them? How does she know that two immortal beings, who could be God, given what she knows, do not have the ability to be everywhere at the same time? 
2. Chidi stating they're in the bad place made no sense, at all, and the best thing is they expected it to happen, it was their plan. Let's be honest, in the first experiment they were actually being tortured, everything was designed to be so, but not in this one, even though some things which goal is to make them better human beings are indeed hard, there is no way he'd get there.
3. The countdown; something to make them believe everything is gonna end somehow. Why did they put it? If they wanted some last good deed, why not prepare something without a countdown, just an activity like everything else.
4. Brent's reaction. There is no way, he, who believed he was going to the Best Place, would react like that. He would try to find a way out, no matter what, he does think he is better than Eleanor and Michael, he would think he can outsmart two immortal beings. Maybe something like Tahani did, try to tell them they were wrong, he didn't belong down there.
5. It doesn't matter how many good points Brent score, because his actions were corrupted all along, and even in the end, he just said it because he thought everything was gonna end, not because he really felt it, so the experiment failed. Simone and John failed, John couldn't keep the secret and left, Simone left, so they just proved Brent made a little change in order to get to the Best Place, and that Chidi can improve, which we already knew.

Simone lays out a wonderful, logical and basically irrefutable case for giving up on Brent: You do a thousand experiments and if you get the same answer every time, you move on. That is eminently sane and impossible to argue with. Brent is, by any empirical measure, irredeemable.

But Jason HAS the answer for that: Throw the Hail Mary.

It seems to me that is the essence of Schurism: Try. Even after it makes no sense, try again. Even after you've failed, keep trying. And when all is lost, throw the Hail Mary. Because trying to be better is the answer. Winning or losing at it isn't really important. It's the trying that matters.

The points system and all the other stuff is a McGuffin. We're never gonna see the show's Good Place, never gonna see the show's Bad Place. Who cares what Judge Gen decides? It doesn't matter. Schur isn't writing about religion. He's writing about a way to live in a world so complicated that the old answers--the religious answers--simply aren't relevant.

Schurism says try. Even when it's irrational to try. Let the chips fall where they may and, when the chips are about to fall into a big hole, throw the Hail Mary.

Jason is being tested to see if he can control his impulses, actually evaluate situations and make better decisions, knowing they will affect other people. 
Tahani had to face one of the people she hated the most and help him becoming someone better, which meant shedding her shallowness and doing something for someone's benefit and not only her own.

But, one night she decided to do something good with her life. She planned to start a charity and the next morning withdrew all her savings to start the project. She died before she could do it, but her sister followed through with the plans.

It was ruled that she belonged to a Neutral Place because they couldnt decide if those good points were to be credited to her.

This reminded me of a story in Islamic Literature: there was a guy, in ancient times, who killed 99 people. He wanted to redeem himself so he went to the Wisest Man on Earth at the time and asked him what he could do. The Wiseman told him theres nothing he could do and that hes doomed. The guy killed him. 100 kills on his conscious, he went to the next wisest man and asked him the same question. Wiseman 2 told him to go to City X and stay there, praying with the good people that reside there. So the guy took off on his journey, but before he could reach it, he died halfway through the distance. The Angels of Mercy and The Angels of Torture both came and argued about where he belongs, He killed 100 people and has never done anything good!, But he came remorseful and marched with his heart to the mercy of God!. So a new angel came down and they made him judge. The angel told them to measure the distance between him and City X, and the distance between him to where came from. If hes found to be closer to City X, hes to be taken by The Angels of Mercy, if otherwise then otherwise... When the man had died, literally in the middle of the journey, he was the same distance away from both points. But he fell forward to his chest (making him closer to City X) so The Angels of Mercy took him.

Chidi:  
First off Chidi did lie however as we know his intent wasn't to cause harm instead it was to spare Jason an eternity of torment of misery and torture, so while lying is bad he did it for a good reason I see this as something that balances itself out. 

For the entirety of the season Chidi has done his best to each others about ethics for the simple fact that he believes everyone with goodness and virtue again with Jason he had an ulterior motive but the goodness of this action far outweighs the negative.

Punching Brent in the face, while satisfying is ultimately a violent action and not something a good person would do.

Assisting Simone in her solipsism this one is a bit iffy he did do the right thing but it was only after Eleanor told him Simone was someone important to him (his soulmate) he wasn't doing it because he believed she should be helped just as a person. 

Trying to help Brent out of the hole, despite everything that had happened Chidi still decided that he should help his fellow man than to leave him for his own needs and even risking his own personal safety to do so. 

John:  
While he understood that he caused harm with his actions toward Tahani he never truly moved on from his original self, yes sure he played nice with the others but as soon as he was given the choice he abandoned the team, he also told the truth about Jason because it was some ""hot goss"", still judged people and ultimately as I see it just pretended to be good so he would have friends and be included in things.  


Brent:   
For basically all of Brent's time in the neighborhood he never changed and only did good actions for the sake of a reward. However his final action of apologizing to Chidi or at least trying to is highly impactful. With the idea of the Best Place gone and the idea of eternal damnation in his mind Brent caved in and wanted to do something truly kind for the first time in his life even if it would do him no good.

Trying to do good and trying to change is one of the key messages in the show and Brent trying to make amends with Chidi after everything that had happened means that he is finally on his first true step to becoming a better person. 

&amp;#x200B;

Simone:  
She has never been good since day one, when in her solipsism phase she abused multiple residents because to her they weren't real so none of her actions would not matter. She trusted none of the residents, creating a board with gathered data to prove that she is not in the Good Place and everything is just some kind of experiment. I can also only assume that she was acting good simply because she didn't want to compromise herself and thus was acting with a negative intent. 

With this episode's revelation of Simone I can no longer see any of her actions being good instead they are all corrupt and done for the sake of her own gain. Now while they weren't harmful actions like causing pain or misery she was still doing these actions for herself. She just wanted to be about everything that was happening.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

3. **Season 3 was better than Season 1.** I liked Season 1, but I prefer the Soul Squad as good friends rather than a group of strangers who dislike each other. Tahani is also extremely annoying in Season 1 but much more sympathetic in Season 3. Michael and Eleanor's father-daughter relationship is also something I loved more about Season 3.
4. **Jason is one of the best characters (pun intended).** Jason is an amazing person at heart who grew up in an extremely crappy place with no positive influences. It's not surprising that he turned out how he did, especially with Donkey Doug as his father. He is super sweet and supportive, particularly of Tahani when he comforted her after the party, when he helped her let loose and have fun, and ESPECIALLY when he dropped a drunk Tahani at her house instead of trying to hook up with her.

I have been doing a Vsauce marathon, and this episode in particular made me wonder if there will be an episode of TGP dedicated to the notion of moral licensing. As a quick cap, moral licensing is basically like the idea of moral desert, as it describes the phenomenon of someone justifying a bad action using previous good deeds to spend a moral credit, to use their existing good deeds as a license to perform bad.

I think it's divided up into layers, like Dante's Inferno.  I think the average every day person (even the suicides who were considered sinners in Christianity) would probably end up in a Medium Place.  But how the decision is made is based on who they were in life as well as how well they do in Purgatory. If you fail too many tests in Purgatory you are more headed toward the Bad Place, or a form of it. 

The slightly bad people end up in Limbo which is like a very basic level of Hell. Maybe it's not terrifying but sufficiently tormenting for the person there. Call it level one. This a place where people who were generally mixed but lean toward bad would go. Example - you didn't kill anyone but you were often arrogant,prideful and looked down on others.  You generally don't deserve spikes being shoved through you for eternity but you're not a ""good person."" 

Individualization is very common in the first level or so. The people who go here have too many bad points and not enough good points or they are there for tailor made Hell. 

As for what makes a Good Place person? Someone who helped others in life, and lived a life of altruism. And The Good Place isn't quite what people think it is - not paradise, but a place where like minds can thrive together. An altruistic person may find that serving soup to the homeless or similar is perfectly fine because it's about who they were as people (and how well they did in Purgatory) that got them where they are. For some people, volunteering isn't work. It's a passion. That's not to say you wouldn't get perks here and there but generally a place where your daily tasks include brushing horses and giving dogs a bath or running a farm would be your labors. You aren't tormented, but because The Good Place is made up of mostly selfless people who did charity work (for the right reasons), you are generally given easy things to do but are also tasks.  The Good Place takes an assessment of the things you like doing and assigns you tasks based  on it. If you liked cooking, you might run a bakery.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I just rewatched episode 7 and all of the lines and reactions are very Maya Rudolph-like (the face she makes when Eleanor talks about bouncing a quarter off Chidi's butt, for example). Plus she says to Michael ""they see what they see, MAN"". Janet would never call a demon ""man"", but the judge uses that word a lot. There was even a big plot point previously about Jason realizing it was Bad Janet because she didn't say ""not a girl"". We all know how forking amazing Darcy Carden is at imitating her co-stars, and during this episode all of her subtleties reminded me so much of Gen. I think this supports the ""team cockroach is the real experiment"" theory.

We know in the trolly episode in season 2 that time had already looped back at least once because Michael left a hint for his plan in the season 2 finale in that episode on the theater marquee in the trolly simulation.

So in the accountant office, it could have only been Mirasol's 39 millionth birthday again if they were at an intersection on the time line or...time just repeats, which according to Jeremy Bearimy, it does. The y loops back to the B.

So maybe the show won't end by the group going to the good place or the bad place. Maybe it will end by someone deciding Earth had become too corrupt for the system to work, and rebooting the entire universe. That would fit with the reboot theme of the show.",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The fact that there even was a new episode means the manifesto had to have been added to, and that couldn't happen unless Bad Janet added to it.  There was a timeskip to the end of the experiment tells me that she did something at the very end. 

Bad Janet reads the manifesto at some point, and sees how humans can improve, which changes her POV on human improvement.  Chidi had already improved, so he was good. Eleanor and Michael finally broke Brent, so he's ok. I'm thinking Bad Janet intercepts the others and convinces them to do something that would improve them at the last minute. 

 I'm not sure exactly how she saved the humans, but my best guess would be to actually show them the manifesto. Simone's whole deal was that she didn't know where she was or what was going on. If Bad Janet shows her the manifesto, she would understand what was going on. She'd also see that Chidi and Eleanor are soulmates, and that love triangle will finally be put to bed.

With every reboot, the four humans improve a little. It's almost as if their being reset was Michael hitting their kill switch - much in the way that Mindy kills and reboots Derek so he becomes a bit more sophisticated. 

On the surface, I'd say Jason and maybe Tahani are not as bad as Simone -  who, despite her judgemental nature, at least believed in the goodness of her bad actions. But their change has been much greater because of the number of times they've been rebooted.

This leads me to my theory...

all of the seven humans are not-robots like Janet and Derek. They're Janet-babies designed to test the strength of the afterlife. This might help to explain why, in all the reboots, there are no children except the half-sister Eleanor met on earth.

Maybe people think it's scary because it seems violent, but I think it's just a facility where you still can live a life doing a job like you would under the traditionally capitalist society we call America, only that misbehaving in terms of the law any further gets you severely punished while being surveyed.
It's like the kiddie pen or the timeout corner version of an already existing state of societal freedom.
You have to get a job like everyone outside of prison, you have activities and classes like you're a graduate student.. what's so different about prison life when it just seems so similar to regular life, only that now death is a much closer incentive for following this pattern of monotonous autonomy-lacking country of zombies who are institutionally possessed by material belongings, having their freedom robbed of from birth?
We are cursed to live as sheep, perpetuating generations of mindless drones who answer the beckons of powerfully corrupt tyrants of our community.
American life itself is a prison of mind. A prison that isolates you from happiness. From a stress free world. From liberation. It traps you, and confiscates your happiness.
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
But it's okay - humans are still learning what the most appropriate political and economical solution is, and maybe they still need more time to adjust to more socialistic types of systems?
I have faith, albeit not a lot of it, in our species, I think there will be a small number of humans who evolve emotionally so much that the brain structure is different to that of Homo Sapiens, emerging a new chapter for psyche of the Homo genus?
Homo Cultus, The ""Enlightened Human.""
Think about how insane that is. Humans are learning rapidly, perhaps the next step in evolution is emotional development in the brain.
Oh my God I think I'm tripping. I'm having weird fears. I think I'm freaking out about us all actually being in hell. That we have all been punished since our births? That this ""life"" is our last chance to make friends with our co-inhabitants?
I think I'm in literal hell. I believe we are already in hell. And I want to get out of it.
I don't want to live in hell. I want to be in the good place. I deserve to be a happy person because I'm trying.
But it's so hard because even when I do good things, I feel like I'm punished immediately after. I don't even know what it is that I did in my past life to deserve this, but I understand that this is my fate. I just wish things would be better for all of us, for you, for me, for your friends, for my family. I wish things would be better for Trump. I wish things would be better for the bullies from middle school. I wish things would be better for the people who hurt me. I wish things would be better for even the most wrong of people. I think everyone has a chance to be kind to one another - we just have to be willing to withstand impatient people. That is to be patient not only with others but yourself. To love who you are, and to accept others as well.
I want to be a better person.
I want to help you be a better person. I want you to help others be better people.
I believe we can do it.
And I'll believe in myself even if no one else does.
Only you know what you must believe in yourself, and only you can believe to be good to other people.
This may be our world - our opportunity to make it better for others born unto the Earth.
Perhaps Earth is already heaven - we're just ruining it because we neglected to maintain our heaven.
That it is not death that is heaven, but our lives right now that is heaven, and that heaven requires work.
Heaven is not free, but death is not an excuse for us to not give a crap, like doing poorly at a job because you know when you'd be leaving. Why is that okay?

Why is it okay to not care about someone else and their goals?
Why is it okay to be mean in this world? There is no point to anything. But that's the fun part - we get to create that ourselves. We have art, science, religion, civilization, friends, Ben &amp; Jerry's, games, cute dogs, romances, hot dog eating competitions, TV shows, music, families, it's beautiful. Why waste any of it?
I think we need to appreciate being alive, but never stop changing to improve daily human life. And we should all work together to preserve that - because why not?

You asked me where my hope comes from? That's your answer""

This quote hit me hard, and it's such a perfect summary of what it is to be a good person. I condensed it into just four words:

Torture may be too harsh of a word to use, but Im having a hard time putting what I mean into actual words. 

With Chidi this season, his position can be argued two ways. The first being that he didnt seem to have solved his indecisive nature until he was tortured with the idea that the person/people he loves (Eleanor/Humanity) would be perpetually doomed to spend eternity in the Bad Place. The second being that in Season 4, he didnt start helping everyone else until he realized the Jason didnt belong, therefore creating a need to help by putting himself in the same torturous situation he was in back in Season 1. 

Brent didnt begin to really show change until he was confronted with the idea of consequence (the thought of being tortured for all eternity). Similar to Michaels realization of consequence in Season 2 when confronted with the idea of drawing to exist as a consequence of getting caught in his still on 2nd reboot lie. 

Even Team Cockroach didnt start starting to become better people until they were confronted with the idea of torture as a consequence for not being better people. 

I fear Im getting away from my point, but I think Im just trying to articulate that just as much the experiment proved the flaws in the point system I think it also kind of proved the need for the Bad Place as well. Or at least a consequence. 

Without torturous consequence I dont think any of our characters would have started the process to become better people. 

Now we all know by now that you cant try to be a better person with corrupt motivation. The show has done an excellent job stating that. But the motivation to begin the process doesnt have to be the same as the motivation to continue and see the process through. Meaning you can want to be a good person because of the consequence of not being one (or its able to start that way), but you CANT be a good person if your motivations stay that way. 

Does anyone else have a better way of articulating that? Did I make any sense or do I just think Im onto something?",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm a bit late to the party. I'm 16 years old, so I didn't grow up with The Office or Parks and Rec, but over the summer, I finally decided to throw on a P&amp;R episode. It quickly became my favorite show of all time, edging out How I Met Your Mother, and I moved on to the Office soon after. I was a massive fan of the UK version, and while I liked this one, it really didn't compare to Parks and Rec. I saw Schur had a new show called the Good Place, and thought it wouldn't be nearly as good as the others, so I ignored it. However, a preview for the show played on my Netflix on Thursday night, and Friday after school, I decided to give it a shot. I instantly fell in love with the show, and felt a bond with the characters. I'm now on season 4 episode 3. This show has the same lighthearted fun as other Schur shows, but has an incredibly well written story with many twists and turns along the way. This show is absolutely masterful. It doesn't edge out Parks just yet, but it's on par with it for sure. While I'm not 100% caught up, I have a couple fears about the ending. If the crew does make it to The Good Place, while it may feel happy and earned, it just seems predictable. If they go to The Bad Place, it just won't feel like theres complete closure. But at this point, I trust them to come up with an amazing ending like they did for The Office and Parks. Thank you Schur. I believe you are the best TV showrunner in the industry right now.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Now my question is, does *everyone* have to get better? It's clear humans can get better in the afterlife, but maybe not everyone can. There's no way that they would send everyone to this purgatory and expect every single person to become better (or at least good enough for the real good place).

In season 3 when the judge came back from Earth, she said that apparently she is black and that they don't like black women down there.

In S4:E6, in the altercation with Brent, when Simone was asked to forgive him when he clearly didn't get it enough to really repent, she asked why ""we"", meaning minorities, were always expected to take the high road in the face of prejudice disrespectful treatment.

This implies that that is what Simone had done in the past. Forgiveness when the person recognizes the error of their ways is great but forgiveness when the person doesn't think they have done anything wrong does not contribute to a correction of their bad behavior.

Chidi expressed this when he initially refused to forgive Michael in season 2 for torturing him in the trolly problem episode. It wasn't until Michael really got it that Chidi forgave him.

Maybe Simone's change was that she took a stand this time, leaving Brent in the hole, knowing he can't die, and giving him incentive to become a better person.",41,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The recent episodes seem pretty innocuous but I fear this may be the diversion, I now believe more than ever, they are still being tortured by Michael. Let me build the case. I'll try to refrain from making too many assumptions and post the evidence that makes the case.

1. Memories of torture - during season 2, we saw Michael going through hundreds of failed experiments. He recently restored the memories of the original 3 residents when they were being 'tortured'. Chidi's memories get wiped so it tortures Eleanor. Tahani is being tortured because she feels useless. Chidi is being tortured for simply not being allowed to remember to learn from his mistakes, which he called it an ""epistemological nightmare"".
2. Jearimy Bearimy, The infinite loop &amp; Immortality - Unless someone figured it out, we don't really know how many experiments Michael ran, but we do know it's a significant amount of time. thousands of years from the human's perspective. From Michael's perspective on the neighborhood he designed, was to succeed by torturing the humans indefinitely. He has revealed that a lot of season 1 was both planned, and improvised, which shows he is methodical and that he has flexibility.
3. Kindness is sometimes torture - During S2 Michael holds back on the fact he has no real solution on how to get them into the real Good Place, and from S3, they get sent back to earth to live their lives after their near-death experience to see if they would improve, in which case, they failed by default because of Michael's intervention(sabotage cough\*) anyway, causing grief and pain. what's worse, throughout all seasons, Love seems to be the thing that is tortured the most.
4. Michael always has a plan... but it backfired somehow - The ultimate goal of S1 for Michael was to create a system where the humans tortured themselves indefinitely. The ultimate goal for Michael afterward has been to get the humans into the 'Real' Good Place. Constant roadblocks that seem natural, but the results is the same, Michael makes a big sale but he underdelivers. They are constantly compromising to the point that they are ""torturing"" themselves to get it to work. S4 seems like it's going well underway, being tortured by their counterparts.

If you view this from a long scope perspective, I believe that Michael has inserted false memories by 'acting' out their reality. Such as in S2 when it seemed like he was breaking down but in reality, it was just a show, so that when he restores their memories, they would remember he did actually torture himself to fix his mistakes. I hope this makes sense.

But there are other alternative theories but I don't feel like getting into it:

1. The story moves towards the direction it's setting up - S1 being Fantasy, S2 being Reality, S3 Death, S4 Rebirth
2. They were in an experiment the whole time to determine where they actually belonged. The immortal beings already knew about the complicated problem because they have existed for infinite. And they've seen it all.

I hope these make sense... I am sooooooo flying right now. And then I had these thoughts.",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When Chidi came to Simone with a sound argument against her coma-assumption, she *quickly admitted she could be wrong,* and *changed her behavior accordingly,* from outright treating them poorly to simply keeping record of her observations in a constructive manner; this is in direct contrast with the popular idea that she's ""just like Brent"" with her ""having to always be right."" 

The issue with Simone isn't that she always *has to be* right, it's that, in her current situation, she usually *is* right. Simone could tell something was up; she thought Eleanor, Michael, and Janet were pulling the strings; she thought it was an experiment in a closed environment; she figured Brent shouldn't have made it to The Good Place; and, my favorite, she thought the punchline to John's jab was ""because I'm burnt,"" all of which was right. 

Being around Brent every day would be a test of patience for anyone, but especially a woman of color. Believing (again, rightly) that a particular person is controlling you on an unprecedented scale, and then seeing a neighbor disappear and never be spoken of ever again after acting out against the controlling person must have been a constant source of unease, so she had to be keep a complacent exterior, not only to figure out what was happening for the intellectual satisfaction, but for the sake of her safety.

Despite having every reason to doubt everything and everyone, she quickly perceived that Chidi was a rare person who was genuine and truly trying to be a good person, who she could accept at face value - another thing she was right about. She found something good in spite of her early coma-suspicion, and changed so much that she went from being likely to literally shove Chidi around like any Janet Baby, to trusting him and making him happy in return.

Even though Simone's take on what to do about Brent's predicament is in contrast with Chidi's point of view, she doesn't drag out the confrontation in an effort to prove she's right. Once Simone hears what Chidi is saying, she communicates that, though she disagrees, she still respects Chidi's position. 

Simone's growth is apparent, and her attitude, from being manipulated and forced to be around an awfu person, is justified.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I've been reading many of the popular theories on here about how the experiment may actually be a test of the original Cockroaches, and although I think there are some keen observations in these theories, I feel there is some possible counterevidence:

Firstly, there was some discussion in the last episode of TGP Podcast about the experiment's point system with writer Dave King (starts at about 11:10). He essentially says that the obelisk and hiding the experiment's score are mostly to benefit the quality of the show's storytelling (because their absence creates tension and keeps more focus on the relationships between characters). It really doesn't seem like hiding the experiment's results is a plot device that's setting up such a twist.

Secondly, we are on episode 7 out of 14, and the finale will be 90 minutes. That means we haven't even seen half of the season yet. If the experiment truly was a test of the original Cockroaches, then that would feel like too easy of a resolution to the central question of Season 4.

Thirdly, the original Cockroaches are acting out partly out of self-interest. If they failed the experiment, they'd be on their way to an eternity in The Bad Place. Wouldn't that negate the results?

I feel that the experiment is probably exactly what it looks like on the face of it. I think it really was just a test of the new humans. At best, it seems the experiment's outcome was ""mixed."" In the final stretch, Chidi and Brent acted selflessly and Simone and John acted selfishly. In any other context, apologizing to someone with nothing to gain from it wouldn't be a big deal, but it's a huge achievement for Brent's character. I think the ambiguous results will lay the foundation for the second half of the season.

If Michael and Glen both defected based on learning more about humanity, then I think the book Bad Janet took to The Bad Place will be the true savior of humanity. The experiment's results will more likely just be another chapter in the book. My wild, shot-in-the-dark guess is that Doug Forcett dies (which would be big news in the afterlife since he's such a celebrity there) and a large trial takes place where The Bad Place uses the book to argue that Doug should be sent to The Good Place (and The Good Place argues the opposite). Anyway, just brainstormin'..",17,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Simone's choice to try to escape at the end of the last episode reminded me of Jason's in ""The Burrito"". Assuming she didn't change her mind and turn back, and assuming she had correctly figured out it was a test (because as far as I know, she wasn't sure yet and just wanted to flee), Simone was trying to not play in the same way Jason had decided to just not play that video game against the Jags.

Judge Gen failed Jason because he never asked if he could not play. I always wondered why that was fair. The way I make sense of it now is, you have to *make* your choices and not leave them to fate, the system, the judge, whatever. Walking away from the choices is not necessarily the same as protesting the choices. It's like the difference between not voting because you don't like any of the candidates and going out on election day to mark in your ballot that you abstain.

Then I started thinking of it in research terms, since Simone was talking experiments and all. Most institutional research ethics boards require that participants in a study have the right to refuse to participate in the study, or to withdraw from the study, at any point. If you participated in an experiment, for example, you would have the right to tell the researcher before, during, and even after the experiment, ""I don't want to do this anymore. I withdraw."" The researcher would then be obliged to exclude any data they have on you from their analyses.

What Simone did is the equivalent of withdrawing from the study without telling the researchers, so her data could still get used anyway. If you've ever taken an survey and just quit in the middle of it, you've exercised your right to not participate. But depending on the researcher and the stance of the ethics board, this won't necessarily count as a withdrawal from the study. The researcher can mark your survey as incomplete but might still analyze the sections of the survey that you did answer, unless you specifically tell the researcher that you withdraw.

Of course, most researchers are taught that participants must give informed consent in the first place. And if deception has been used to hide the true nature of the study (say, to avoid influencing participants' motivations to do good deeds), they are supposed to debrief participants at the end of their participation and tell them the truth. Even studies where participants are informed might end with debriefing anyway, just to make sure the participant understands what happened and has not been harmed.

So, the difference between Simone and Jason is that Jason was informed (well, as far as Jason can be informed), and Simone was not. It's now the researchers' ethical responsibility to track her down and debrief her, which I hope we'll get to see in the next episode.

Okay, enough from me. Cue Eleanor's ""debrief"" \[*snort*\] jokes.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Janet specifically says that ""Neither of them called her [to get a train out of the neighborhood]"" Some speculation has been made that they found Mindy St. Claire's house. While this would definitely be interesting, and I'd really want to know what they would think if they saw the sex tape of Chidi and Eleanor, there is another Chekhov's gun that has been established namely the handcart Glenn used to get to the neighborhood and that Michael and Jason used to rescue Janet.

This idea would require both that the handcart is still there and that the group forgot about it. While this is absolutely not a given and all they'd have to say in order for the Mindy St. Claire option to be true is that Janet somehow made the handcart disappear. However, it's not established that Janet can make trains and carts appear and disappear at will. In fact, she is shown to call the trains and that a Janet (or Derek kind of being) is needed to run the train.

 So, if Janet can't make the the handcart disappear (which we don't know) and the group forgot about it (which might be a stretch) it would mean that the handcart's still there. Now that I've established the big problems with this idea, I will now establish the things supporting the idea that the handcart's there

Michael, Jason and Janet are shown leaving the Bad Place by the handcart and the next episode comes after a time jump. So, we know they at least started the journey on the cart, even if they ditched it later. We don't know that they'd have a spot to put the handcart. As much as it might be a stretch to say they forgot about it, the group is not shown to be perfect. But nonetheless, this is the main flaw with this theory. 

But, suppose that it did happen. It would be interesting to see them try to escape when the only other destination might be the Bad Place.

&gt;!Next step, my theory for the funerals (part of a larger thing I can't manage typing out right now, but works as a standalone reveal/plot point)

I think the next major thing we'll hear is that the core four (and all others) didn't die in the ways we've been told they did, the flashbacks are created by the speculations/hypothetically possible and detailed enough to be believable stories, told by Michael (could have been from pre-memory wiped Michael and Shawn writing the files) to inspire change. The deaths all contain a clear trait to change about themselves that they needed ""spotlit"" (a word I just invented combining the fact I ""spotted"" it, and because everything is so ""lit"" in the show), it was another nudge in the right direction.

If each of the four killed themselves in various ways Michael would have shielded them from the harsh realisations, and wanted them to have a reason/drive to live their afterlives that they'd lost on Schurverse-earth.

Though each of those stories when examined, contains a nugget of subjective/plot-device-esque ""truth"", in terms of their actions assisting in leading to those outcomes; it's a very cushioned blow, and I think we're all going to need a break to digest what comes next, so maybe the holiday break is well timed in a few respects.

Jason planned his own death, he made the ""safe"" plans, he died at 27 (classic/near trope suicide age), perhaps he *is* pre-successful and his dance crew succeed when he's gone, it does happen to folk who die before their art and personhood is appreciated, and is a tough death for tons of reasons. My guess is it was whippets/drugs (which can and does happen to anybody), that he planned to take, but maybe didn't plan to die from that time, and his depression was not being appreciated/recognised/successful/wealthy enough to live outside the poverty trap/with basic needs met, or he may have died sleeping in a dumpster after walking someone safely home (as he did when Tahani was in her ""Heir B&amp;B"").

Tahani is his opposite in that respect as she was well recognised (ever-never enough), and Chidi is meant as his opposite in intellect, though as they confirmed his teen years having been erased, it means we've not really met the real Jason, as he's his memories back now, he's playing dumb, because everyone likes him as a mostly dumb (not speaking) person. If he was a nerd in highschool, about anything (football/games/movies/music), but none of that was accessible for his afterlife, he is a different person than what he became in his afterlife, more than anyone (I assume that's how/why Michael knew they couldn't just erase Simone's memories of Chidi as he said they're intertwined and it screws it up, or something).

Tahani died by dragging a golden idol down upon herself. She was crushed that she wasn't top of the Schurverse-earth rankings as much as the neighbourhood rankings (near ""worst"" of a list of extraordinarily good people, as Michael reminds her, causing the sinkhole to close) and her envy was her undoing. She was tearing someone down as much as John did (I think the same premise carries for the newer test subjects, see below). I'm hesitant to say, ""she did it for attention"" because that's never the absolute intent, and isn't what that should ever be read to mean, more she did it because she was starved for *meaningful* attention, or recognition that wasn't coupled with a reminder of her inferiority/a backhanded push to collaborate and share glory.

Chidi's is as loose as his almond milk claim, by ""grand design""(godly/architect joke), he banged on the air conditioner before being crushed by it falling when he was paralysed by indecision. Something meant to keep him cool, taking an unscheduled and not rigorously and meticulously planned dive, killed him. I think he lost someone who grounded him (the gf he was bugging in bed/the person his best friend ended up engaged to and not best-man at {same person? would be a nice loop around to Eleanor being OK with him with Simone, as another thing Chidi failed to master that Eleanor has a natural grasp for despite not having an internal thesis of rules}). I think his guilt is that he feels he didn't truly care about them as he was selfish in his reliance on their emotional labour, the way Eleanor and Co are reliant on his teaching them all. Also, he climbed into the hole with Brent, knowing the folk who cared for him would rescue them both (A Schur thing, Eleanor confirms), though he did it because he understands the rules, not out of pure humanity, but by rote)

Eleanor may have gone on that shopping trip, but hers is similar to Chidis chilli-crisis, but she didn't have another ""her"" around to help herself out of the proverbial sinkhole she was in (till/like when Real-Eleanor stuck up for her to Shawn). Her friends are ones who'd bail on her birthday to go sleep with their married boyfriends, leaving her drinking alone. If she'd gone home with her ""lonely gal margarita mix"", tons of junk food, and intended on passing out on her vibrator, that sounds like a crappy birthday at best, yet not traditional ""torture""; regardless of how much she would love to not need others in her life, she does. She despairs in her loneliness as much as Mindy does, sure she's ultimately ""safe"" there from others, but as Mindy says in illustrating their options whennrhey bailed to her neighbourhood, all those tracks lead to ""you never see your friends again"".

Eleanor mirrors/contrasts with Tahani and Chidi, too. Chidi in how he knows what to do because it's learned from books, and is playing the application game for reward; Eleanor by her conscience and her inner voice does the better things when improving. Tahani was born into wealth so much that it'd be a dream for Eleanor, that comes with people, but not authenticity.

New-Bees similarly: John, died using lip fillers, still wanted a beautiful corpse, had felt bad about Tahani dying and everything he wrote about, and was doxxed by Tahani fans.

Brent I've not fully day-plotted for, but his superiority is likely the primary issue, same as Chidi still believing he's good enough to leave others behind. I'd like if he was Acidcat's dad, seems fitting from all we know.

Simone lost Chidi (who would have proposed otherwise), her pain mirrors his, maybe she'd think the study and his breakdown were her fault for scienceing too hard and being cold and objective in supplying the right answers, because people don't like the truth (Simpson's quote tangent: ""You want the truth!?....When you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo [Glenn] that was your best friend's face, you don't know what to do, forget it Marge [Tahani?], it's Chinatown""), so they reject the truth, and seek a different truth that they'd prefer to be real, and then was crushed by people at a black friday sale (because she's {first-}Gen, she's done thousands of experiments on people, which bus the problem, really, along with the propensity to make judgements, and thinks she knows all about when lines are too-crossed)

I think we're going to see their actual Schurverse-earth funerals next, and see the people that turned up (like Ben/Markus, who Eleanor made out with in the walk-in freezer at the bagel place {Adam Scott when Trevor snuck down to Schurverse-earth?! Calling him Ben is my habitual issue too, so, same}). They'll see those who grieved for having lost them, and hear what folk have to say about who they were in their lives and their deaths.

My brain goes for the darkest-timeline a lot, and I'd half-hoped I was way off when I thought of it last year, but I can think of nothing else that makes sense, and evidence is building as my confirmation bias does.

It's dark, but it's real, like the magic of humanity (Hey ""Presto""/""Michael""/""Ted Danson"", if you're somehow reading this)

Anyway, do tear it to shreds/have @ me, if anyone reads this (congratulations, and I'm sorry), that is...!&lt; 

I mean, it's like something out of a &gt;!Chip Driver!&lt; Mystery...

I have anxiety and have been battling with depression over the past few years. Therapy and medicine are, of course, the best way to battle against this condition and treat this disease, but art can also be effective and inspiring. That's what The Good Place has been for me.

I usually don't start to watch any TV show until it second season airs and the reception is as good as the first season, if not better. But something about The Good Place premise called my attention and I started watching in the premiere. As someone who reads a lot about techniques in audiovisual media, writing process and analyze things in a ""rational"" way, The Good Place was outstanding. The way that the series developed its characters and the plot, how it managed to build up to the twist without smashing the clues in our faces, how it took it's references (The Wizard of Oz, The Twilight Zone, pop/nerd jokes, etc) to create something new and exciting made me a fan by the moment Eleanor say ""Holy motherforking shirtballs at the finale"".

But then, at season 2, something less rational started to happened: I looked for the series to lift up my humor and energy. The entire message of ""humans can improve and how"" caught me completely off guard, and it touched me truly, deeply. 

For anyone who is battling a mental disease, the worst thing is fighting with yourself. The Good Place made this fighting easier (or at least ""less tougher"") by simply delivering perfectly an obvious, and even cliche message: pobody's nerfect, anyone can improve, and the best thing we can do is try to be better than we were yesterday. It's something that we often see in children programs, but to see it being delivered, in a flawless, creative, and fulfilling way really got into my head like I didn't know that before.

It is a testament to the show's writing/planning quality that it can be both ""rationally"" well executed, and emotionally satisfying. But it is even more impressive to see, and experience myself, how a good work can change someone's perspective, can improve someone's mindset.

The Good Place is my comfort place. Is where I go to laugh about silly jokes, is where I go to escape my mind and the world around me. But it is also the place where I mostly remember that I can get better, that the world around me can get better, that fills me with the hope that, someday, I may not need it to see the silver linings in my life. 

It's sad for me (for us, I think), that the series is coming to an end, but I'm already, and forever grateful for The Good Place.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

&gt;[](#Eleanor) The six of us are not getting into the Good Place. But there are still people in this world that we care about, so I say we try and help them be good people. Try and help them get in. ***I mean, why not try? Its better than not trying, right?***

Thats the overarching moral of the show, imo. You gotta try.

As for this season, it gets a bit nebulous as obviously all of them are doing everything they can to save humanity and by extension themselves, which may or may not count as a corrupted motivation. But regardless which way Gen comes down on that, in S3 alone I think theyve all earned a ton of points.

So were left with the three newbies. Now Ill preface this by saying that I dont think John, Brent or Simones scores will matter in the end as I think humanitys fate will be determined by the scores of the original cockroaches, but nonetheless its fun to speculate on whether theyre up, down, or neutral.

___

**John** I think is definitely up. Hes trying, which is what matters most. He still backslides into snarky put-downs every now and then, but hes made a genuine effort to befriend Tahani and try to make amends.

Most importantly, his motive is not corrupt. Until the latest episode, he had no suspicion that this wasnt the real Good Place, and thus the points he earned prior to E7 should all count. He was doing good things for the sake of doing them, not to earn some moral dessert.

He loses some points for getting in the Escalade with Simone, but overall I still think hes in the positive.

___

**Brent** is probably neutral or very slightly up. The problem with Brent is that his motivation had been corrupt from the beginning. He only started trying to do good because he thought it would earn him a spot in the Best Place, the same problem Eleanor had in S1 when her points never counted because she was trying to stay.

But similar to Eleanor, last episode he was given an opportunity to actually start earning points once he knew that he was a lost cause. From the moment Chidi drops the This is the Bad Place bomb on him and confronts him with being a bad person, he has the chance to improve by acknowledging his shirtiness and apologizing for it, which he *may* have been on the verge of doing by episode end.

Some commenters have pointed out it could be another fake apology, I am so, so sorry you dont understand what a great person I am, just like his reaction to his negative book reviews but lets give him the benefit of the doubt. Its possible he may have earned a couple points right at the end.

Regardless, his behavior in the afterlife has been on par with his behavior on Earth. Unlike John whos improved and Simone who Ill get to in a minute, Brent has been the most consistent. That would still put him in the negative overall, but he might be trending upwards with his last act. (In a way he could be like Mindynot a good person, but dying right when he starts to make a turn for the better.)

&gt;[](#Gen) You will have one year of Earth time ***to try to improve the humans.*** I will be monitoring everything to ensure theres no cheating and to track the humans progress.

&gt;[](#Matt) So Ill be monitoring the four new humans. **** A modified point system will be applied to their actions for the next year, and then well know ***how much better or worse their behavior is than when they were alive.*** But no one will be able to see whats happening in real time. Good luck saving humanity from eternal doom.

The aim of the experiment was to show that humans could improve within the controlled environment of the Neighborhood, to see how much better or worse they were than when they were alive.

It was ***not*** a requirement that they earn enough points to qualify for the actual Good Place or even pull off a net positive point score overall.

Under those much looser criteria I think even Brent would qualify as an example in humanitys favor. If his final apology to Chidi was genuine, then he was marginally better in the afterlife than he was on Earth. Thats good enough.

**** Matty does explicitly say here that hes monitoring the newbies and not the original cockroaches, but I think Gen must have instructed him to say that. Else it would have corrupted the cockroaches motivations and ruined the experiment, if they knew they were the subjects all along. My theory is that Gens design is a blinded experiment, where the cockroaches dont know theyre the ones whose results matter.

___

**Simone** I am confident is way down. From the moment she entered the afterlife she went down a solipsism black hole, or in Chidis words, acted like a jerk. Then she appeared to turn the corner when she started a relationship with Chidi, but her whiteboard from E7 reveals that her motivations have been corrupt all along.

She only got close to Chidi and everyone else in order to collect data. She wanted to test her hypothesis that this wasnt the real Good Place, so any good she might have done in the neighborhood wouldnt count. This was pre-TGP Tahanis problemsuperficial goodness for fame and adoration (Tahani) or to prove youre right (Simone) does not earn you points.

It was all fake, and I think its even worse than Eleanors corrupt motivations in S1 because at least Eleanor was being sincere in her relationships. Here its not even clear whether Simone truly values her friends or just views them all as test subjects, or worse, suspects.

I also think she loses a ton of points for abandoning Brent and especially Chidi at the hole. Its a betrayal on top of indifference. She broke Chidis heart a couple times last episode and didnt seem to care.

The irony is that pre-afterlife, Simone probably had a pretty good score. But it was exposure to the controlled environment of the Neighborhood that influenced her to take a bad turn, as her mind could not accept the reality of it. Its similar to some old theories Ive read on here, that the real Good Place is populated with people who were good in life but terrible in the afterlife, because they realize that nothing they do matters anymore. They paid their dues in life, so they feel entitled to act like dirtbags now.

Simone might be the canon example of such a person.

___

So overall I think the results of the experiment will be in humanitys favor, regardless of who are the actual test subjects, the newbies or the original cockroaches.

* Chidi counts under both scenarios, and he definitely improved from his original life on Earth. **Pass.**

* John definitely improved from his Earth life. **Pass.**

* Brent *may have* improved, depending on whether his final apology was genuine. **?**

* And Simone got worse for sure, but shes the only one Im confident we can say that about. **Fail.**

Either 50% or 75% passMichael and the gang should win. If instead its the original cockroaches who were being tested

* Eleanor seriously stepped up and pushed through to the very end. She had some stumbles early on, but she recovered and showed she was so much better than her pre-TGP self. **Pass.**

* Tahani formed a genuine friendship with someone who spent a good chunk of his life trashing her. She was a supportive member of her group, stepping out of the spotlight for the good of the team and to help her friends. **Pass.**

* Jason might be the most improved, given where he started. He showed self-control, thoughtfulness, and actual wisdom. He inspired the group with his natural kindness and guided them during some critical moments of self-doubt. **Pass.**

* And Chidi sacrificed himself for the good of the experiment, and humanity. After the mindwipe he gradually evolved to become more decisive and to take a stand, helping Brent get to the point where he could actually improve himself. **Pass.**

We were going to the Good Place together! 

I found a super-cheap plane ticket, booked it, bought the VIP tickets for Monday, and spent weeks in excited anticipation. With my wild-man beard I even planned to try and cosplay Derek while there.

It would have been a lot more expensive for me to fly out Sunday, but we worked out the timings (\*NERD ALERT\* there was an actual spreadsheet involved and data from Google on expected drive times.) The Monday flight got in early enough so that the plan would totally work. Life is good.

Then it all went to shirt. For the first time in my life I arrived at the airport too late/ The flight was closed before I finally got to the counter to drop off my checked bag. Worse than that I was told that yes, they could rebook me, but on a flight that didn't get in until late Tuesday night. Panicked I exhausted every possibility to get there, cost be damned. There were no flights from any airline that could take me from Cincinnati to Los Angeles that could get there in time. Instead of being there together my wife went with a cousin and now I'm going to be sad and super jealous of her for the rest of my life.

When my friends and co-workers ask me why I'm so depressed right now I'm too embarrassed to tell them ""I missed out on seeing the set of a TV show"". I don't think any of them would understand how much this show means to me, but I'm betting you guys do.

Of course, I could be wrong just wanted to see if anyone else shared my views or disagree? Would love to hear either way ",31,1,False,self,,,,,

Spoilers up to Season 4, Episode 7.

&amp;#x200B;

* First, the criticism of Simone's solipsism phase. The accusation is that Simone is selfish, because she harmed the other residents in the neighborhood, believing them to be figments of her imagination. 

I don't want to religion-bash too much, so let's stick to Simone's perspective. As an neuroscientist, the concept of an afterlife is extremely farfetched for Simone. Given her observations, it's overwhelmingly more likely that she's having hallucinations while her brain shuts down. And if Simone were really hallucinating, I don't see much wrong with her behavior. She had fun, which is good because she's a real person, figments of her imagination were inconvenienced by being pushed in pools and having their hair cut off. Nothing that a short ""Hey, Janet,..."" won't fix, and besides, they're (hypothetically) not real.

But more importantly, after discussion with Chidi and reflection, she decided that even the very small chance that the situation was real was worth treating people with kindness. That's actually very selfless of her, in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

* Second, the criticism of Simone's data collection in 'Good Place'. The accusations are that Simone was interacting with the others under false pretenses during her investigation, and that she should have told others, particularly Chidi, sooner. 

As a counter, I think it's possible to be genuinely friendly to people while suspecting you are being studied in a controlled environment. Even in the most textbook psychology studies similar to the 'Split or Steal' round of [Golden Balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Balls) where people \*know\* they are being tested, they can still make decisions out of true kindness, if (they believe) their actions have real effects on others. Besides, Simone had no idea what the experiment was about or how the results would be used, so she wouldn't know what behavior to fake.

Simone was mostly suspicious of the authority figures, Eleanor, Michael, and Janet. She saw the other 5 members of her group more as fellow subjects. Until S4E7, Simone had been passively observing. The moment she started actively investigating, thus putting the group at risk, she informed them about her observations and plans. 

She didn't confide in any of them, not even Chidi, before then, because they might ""compromise the integrity of the data collection"". I understand that as meaning the others might be less scientific than her in their approach, influencing the way Eleanor and Michael are running the experiment, and obscuring their initial motivations. Apart from her reasoning, this is just a group that doesn't trust each other fully, yet. Simone kept her suspicions to herself, Brent kept the secret of the 'Best Place', and Chidi and John kept Jianyu's identity secret. That doesn't make any of them bad people, because trust in a group grows organically over time. It does, however, say something about the depth of Simone and Chidi's relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

* Third, the criticism that Simone ""always has to be right"". John accuses her of this after she confronts him with the fact that his job consisted of making fun of people he's never met. 

Of course John got defensive after hearing something like that, anyone would. Simone may be more confrontational than most people, but she is perfectly capable of admitting she's wrong. She gave up on solipsism, after all. She also later respects Chidi's position in the decision whether or not to save Brent. As a scientist, changing her mind when the data suggests she should was her job. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Finally, the criticism that she left Brent behind. 

Aside from the fact that everyone in the scene wasted a lot of time talking instead of rescuing or running, this was actually a valid moral dilemma. Is it impermissible/permissible/obligatory to risk the safety of three people, to attempt to save one 'worse' person? 

Just like the trolley problem, there is not necessarily a right or wrong answer. And just because the danger is in fact fake, doesn't invalidate the reasoning of a person who believes for good reason that the danger is real.

Also note that Chidi only saved Brent ""because \[he has\] this stupid moral code that forces \[him\] to help everyone"". It seems he would also have thought it obligatory to endanger a bigger group to a greater degree, to save a person worse than Brent. At some point, that becomes indefensible. I'm not saying that leaving Brent behind was definitely the right choice, but there is something to be said for both sides.",50,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So my theory for awhile has been that eventually it'll come down to the realization that people CAN improve, but you have to help them improve on a small-scale basis and it usually takes a lot of failed attempts before improvement sticks (essentially the journey of the Soul Squad). So with this realization, the group will be given the choice to either move on to the good place themselves and maybe some people will sift through from time to time, OR they can offer themselves up to run the experiment ad infinitum for eternity to ensure that every human has the real opportunity to show their potential for improvement and earn their spot in the good place. And because of course the soul squad won't be ok with condemning most/all of humanity to the Bad Place, they'll choose to sacrifice their spots in the Good Place and stay in the Medium Place forever to help save humanity a few people at a time. (It's essentially their version of the Trolley Problem, and the solution is to sacrifice yourself - this was stated by Michael towards the end of S2).

Mike Schur has been vocal that the core of the show is the question ""what do we owe to each other?"" and this seems like his answer to it. And in the process of sacrificing themselves, they'll still get to spend eternity together, looping through Jeremy Bearimy alongside the people/demon/Janet who they love the most.

TLDR: There is no such thing as The Bad Place. What's going on isn't unique, and is a trial/purgatory that all humans have to go through to get into The Good Place. The point of the show is that every human is redeemable, regardless of how big of an ashhole they seem to be. Ps: Chidi might be God (But not God as we know him).

This theory is inspired by the many theories I've read on this subreddit (I don't have a list of these theories as I've just been reading them casually, never thinking I'd post my own, so if you feel any element of this theory has been appropriated from another source please point it out in the comments).  Also by the title of the episode: ""Help is Other People"". 

As many people are already aware, one of the major inspirations for the show is Jean Paul Sartre's play 'No Exit', in which a group of people are trapped in what they think is a waiting room for Heaven, but is actually Hell and they've been placed there to torture each other for all eternity. The inversion of Sartre's famous phrase ""Hell is other people"" into ""Help is Other People"" got me thinking. What if the whole show is an inversion of the plot and meaning of the original play?

What if what we've been watching is actually a sort of 'waiting room' for heaven, where everyone has to go through a cycle of trials and lessons until they have shed their flaws from Earth and are truly ready to go to The Good Place? The reason that I think this is the case is that all the ordeals that the humans have gone through don't just feel like planned tortures or random events, they all seem like they were specifically planned to teach the humans lessons, and make them face their flaws. One of the best things about the show is that you can see the effect that all the ordeals have had on the characters. The Good Place is one of the only sitcoms where the characters become better people over time, and the premise of the show shifts widely every season to reflect their progress along their path to redemption.

Season 1: Elenore is forced to face up to the bad things she did back on Earth. She decides to become a better person (for selfish reasons). Chidi is put in an awkward situation where he is forced to become more decisive and help another person in need, even if he isn't sure if it's the right thing to do( but as I'll mention later, Chidi might not be the one being tested). Jason is put in a position where he has to control his impulses and reflect on the effects of his decisions before he acts. Tahani is placed with a soul mate that doesn't constantly stroke her Ego and reaffirm her facade of perfection. She also has to come to terms with all of her attempts at gathering appraisal from the other residents blowing up in her face. To the audience, it seems that this is Eleanor's fault, but Tahani doesn't understand this and blames herself. We later learn that the demons were causing disasters to mess with everyone. The pivotal moments are; when Eleanore confesses to her lies showing she's internalised the lessons of this part of the trial; Jason partakes in forming plans with the study group, thinking ahead and acting in everyone's best interest instead of doing whatever he feels like doing in any given moment; Tahani becomes part of the group, showing real vulnerability, loosening her isolationist tendencies, and 'above it all' mindset. Chidi begins to rely more on his intuition, still maintaining some indecisiveness, but adopting an actional philosophy that where any action that helps other people is the right one, even if he must behave unethically by some standards. Overall they all learn to abandon their unique brand of selfishness and self-obsession and learn to work as a group. This marks the end of the first section of the trial.

Season 2: The trial is reset and repeated over and over with slightly altered variables to make sure that their self-improvement wasn't a fluke. It is repeated until they gather a consistent result amongst all the humans, that given a push in the right direction, they will always become less selfish and learn to work together (I think there is no limit to how long they may repeat this. I believe Micheal mentioned at one point that they were stuck doing repeats for more than 300 years? This is why I believe there is no Bad Place, and that every human passes eventually. Some just take longer than others.) The facade of the this all being a new kind of torture is kept up even moments before a reset because the higher entities know that a future section of the trail requires giving the humans back their memories of all the resets, and of every time they became better people and that any break in character would ruin the whole thing. When this section is complete, they are told that the test is complete and they are going to the real Bad Place. The only way out is to put all their selfishness and paranoia aside, take a leap of faith (a leap into faith?) that Micheal isn't betraying them, and go through literal Hell together in order to reach the Judge.  The Judges tests not only gauge their progress but also provide a chance for self-reflection (Tahani, in particular, does some of her most overt character growth during this sequence when she sees her parents). Elenore gets the chance to go to The Good Place but refuses to go without the others, which I believe is part of her test. If you think about it in this regard, the balloon episode makes much more sense. Why would they make a detector that can determine if you are worthy of The Good Place if the balloon can't actually go to the good place? I think instead it was to not only check if they were ready to take the Judges tests, but put them in the frame of mind to consider their own virtue. We are told that they failed the test, but I think if they had truly failed, as in, not shown enough improvement, then it would have resulted in another reset. The humans are deemed ready to move onto the next phase and are sent back to Earth.

Season 3: Whether or not this is actually Earth or just another part of Purgatory designed to replicate Earth doesn't really matter. The point of this phase is to see if they will become better people in a non-sterile environment, exposed to all the elements that made them bad people in the first place. They all persevere and decide to become better people, even considering the few minor speedbumps they encounter along the way. After they are ""accidentally"" made aware of the situation, and told that this ruins any of their chances of getting into The Good Place, none of them turn to cruelty, or evil, or hedonism, or even to their old ways. They continue to grow and decide to confront people from their old life. Trying to save others that they think need saving. Along the way they learn of the goodness inside of people that they all thought were lost causes. Elenore and her mother, Tahni and her sister, Jason and Donkey-Doug. When they are made aware of the goodness in people they turn their attention to saving all of humanity, even though they know that they cannot get into The Good Place themselves. I'll skip over a few events that set up the next phase of the trial, as I believe most of it is pageantry by the higher beings for the sake of the humans to set up the last phase where they become responsible for the souls of others, with some more chances for self-reflection dotted along the path, similar to meditation spots on a religious pilgrimage.

Season 4: Finally they arrive at the final trial. They have to save the souls of others. Notice that at no point in this season do any of the original humans express concern about themselves getting into The Good Place. They've become completely selfless and dedicated to saving the souls of others. They are given back all their memories of the hundreds of years that they spent in the afterlife, giving them a complete understanding of what it truly means to become a better person (Kinda similar idea to the short story 'The Egg' by Andy Weir). In the early episodes of this season, they have to work past the annoying flaws that the new humans have, and how much they would've hated some of these people back on Earth. After a certain point, however, they never doubt what they are doing, and never question if these people deserve to be saved. They all adopt the mindset that everyone can be redeemed, and everyone can shed their flaws because they have memories of themselves doing it hundreds of times.

My prediction for the end: The original humans will be told that the experiment was a failure, that the rest of humanity is still doomed, but in the process, they have proved themselves good enough to go to the real Good Place. This is a larger-scale version of the conundrum Elenore faced at the end of Season 2. Except instead of the choice being save yourself and doom your friends; the choice is whether or not to save yourself AND your friends, but in the process doom the rest of humanity. They will all refuse to go to The Good Place, demonstrating the last act of pure altruism, and a refusal to abandon all of humanity. They will pass the final test, the reality of what was going on all along will be revealed to them, and they will all be permitted to enter The Good Place to live in paradise for all eternity, safe in the knowledge that every human is redeemed in the end.

Flaws in the theory: The biggest flaw with this theory comes whenever we see one of the higher beings such as the demons, the Judge, Micheal, or the Janets, interacting with each other when the humans' aren't around. Why would they keep up the charade when the humans can't see them? I can't explain this. But if the theory is true, the show may provide an explanation. Either way, I like my theory.

I believe that The Good Place is the perfect cure for Nilhsim, as it is the only philosophy or religion that is completely incompatible with the premise of the show. It is also one of the only major philosophy that is never mentioned by Chidi, as the idea that there is no meaning to the world is proved wrong in the circumstance they find themselves in.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus: Chidi might be God.

The most open clue that Chidi is God is the fact that Chidi means ""God Lives"" in Igbo, a language from Nigeria, as pointed out by Kamilla. I put forward that Chidi is in fact, God. If not the creator of the universe, then at least the one above all that decides on the moral rules that humans are so harshly judged by.   
I think the depiction of God in this manner is very interesting when thought of through the lens of the belief that many hold that God is simply an abstraction or personification of the creative and destructive force of the universe or even the concept of right and wrong itself. In this regard, Chidi's indecisiveness could be a depiction of how complicated the world has become, and how it is almost impossible to know if you are doing the right thing or not.

Why is God hanging out with humans in the fake Good Place? Why was he on Earth? This comes back to the question of; if God is real, can he learn? If not it means that God is missing one of the best traits in humans, the ability to learn from mistakes and decide to be better. But if God can learn then that means that he is not all-knowing, and is capable of making mistakes in the first place. This non-static idea of God accurately reflects the ever-changing morality of the world, and how right and wrong seems to change with time.

I propose two reasons that Chidi is where he is, if he is actually God. Either he has decided to subject himself to the plight of a normal human, to better understand the nature of their morality, and to know if even he could stand up to the judgements he lays on mortals.

 Or he is part of every cycle of trials for every group of humans and acts as a sort of guide for souls in the afterlife. My reason for thinking this is the motif of Chidi being framed as a sort of saviour in the 4th season, basically, humanities only hope. As I do think that the creators of The Good Place have purposely avoided running too close to any of the major world religions so that the meaning of the show can be adopted by people of any religion, or of no religion at all, I don't think Chidi is a stand-in for Jesus or the Christian/Judean/Islamic God. However, he may fill the role of messiah or saviour in the end. Either way, it is unclear if Chidi is aware that he is God.",43,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Welcome to my meta-four-um
The Friend-ship and self-love Arc Theory

***Spoilers for all episodes out, and endgame theory speculation***

Long title:
Who we are, and who we are not: Practical Ethics and their application in the modern world; a treatise and explanation of values, according to the works of Alain LeRoy Locke, and Emmanuel Kant 

Or:

""Arc of the covenant""-
Above and over-board training: Navigating and 'knowing' ourselves, as an audience of shipmates where no one comes 'first' **winks**

(Seafaring puns and references that I ""ship"" with the show, in theory)

***CW-mention of self-harm/suicide***

OK, settle in, this is ""loooooong"" (in Gen's voice)

I (somewhat disjointedly) posted before about the core-four causing their own deaths, not entirely in the ways we were shown, (like stopping on the proverbial tracks to dehumanise someone ""good"", banging the killer air conditioner they use to keep their cool, tearing down their counterpart/idol upon themselves; or being Trojan-horsed in a ""safe"" place, smothered and alone {the follies of the mains}); and how Michael may have been cushioning the blow by giving them a more tangible immediate goal, and embellishing details of how their actions led to their deaths by misadventure, and them (effectively) ending their own lives.

This follows on from that in exploring the idea of a noble death,  and that all things have many perspectives; the only 'subject' we can truly know 'subjectively', if at all, is ourselves.

I think Michael's act in pushing the humans through the portal, was his executing a ""suicide mission"", in good faith; his ultimate goal, to pass the buck (and book!) to the next generation, for them to (bad news) bear down, and fix the issues. I think he believed that was it for him, ""Adios! Janito!*"", as well as him passing his own incremental test. But Shawn's never aimed to harm Michael, nor has he prevented him from experimenting, he even played a judge as a pre-test for the humans, under the conditions Michael expected, based on Doug Forcett and Mindy's cases, that Shawn had guided him through/did as examples for his apprentice (like how Michael trained Eleanor to become the architect of sorts). Shawn covers for Michael, while maintaining the illusion of evilness (a hat-trick by another ""real"" magician; Gen is not an almighty judge, either) and subtley undermining the system (his self-sacrifice/s before failed, so he's resigned to the workings as they appear, for him, but urges Michael to succeed) as well as proclaiming its success to those who might need to believe that at that time in their journeys. He's guiding Michael in 'his own' way, he raised him as a demon, subversively teaching him everything he knows about value and hope in humanity, through some human-style methods, fear of retirement, belief in reincarnation (second chances), fear of expulsion/repulsion, and in completely demonising him, in an afterlife where a crow's-nest, becomes more of an Eagle's Nest* in its view of those left ""below"". This was done to/for Michael, intending that he would not feel/be biased in being connected to the ""newmans"" (New-humans) that he was trying to use as a good example. Only Shawn (still) knows there's familial connection in the mix, and has orchestrated it so that Michael fears crossing the inappropriate boundaries (revealing himself to Eleanor/Jason, or their peers). He also has to intermittently deal with the characters/lives created by Michael, when/by running his experiments; those from both before, and after, Michael volunteered to wipe his own memory, so Shawn has to run/work tirelessly in ""the afterlife"" (he makes a grand- ""daddy"", in that respect) and manage the discarded babies, and foster some hope in them.

I think Shawn is ""Real-Michael"" (advanced; who was in 'life' Doug Shellstrop; born on third-base, but a game-changer), at his moment of death (/effective purgatory staycation/life-changing coma-fantasy?!), he opted for death rather than stagnation (Mindy=paused, no learning, no improvement, till connections are made; to save others?/organ donation?/deal with himself as his own ""demon"" and leave his kids to be kids?). He *could* have gone back/'lived' and tried to repair his relationship with with Eleanor on earth, or build/mend bridges with Jason/anyone else, he felt irredeemable when he examined his life-before-afterlife, saw that good could come from his death, and took the plunge/unplugged. He left his mortal coil, still unSchur whether anyone was worth any of it.

He learned in/after death, the error of *his* ways, and became a proverbial ""Angel""-Michael, but he didn't know if it was possible for others to attain the same heights or have the same result after calculations, if they came from worse or better than him; so he wrote a program, made a VR-server, modelled on the good and bad parts of himself, with the capacity to learn, and granted early-Janet admin permissions. He put in his headphones, plugged in/docked in an open port and experimented on himself (using others would be cruel), in his own head (where the CGI budget is unlimited). He invented (split himself into) people who mirrored and contrasted who he had become, effectively sharing his dollar among three (like 'hit points', if there's a group limit; Eleanor 33%, Jason 27%, and Tahani 40%-44% {per the Queen Bee exception, basically Janet if she had lived, and been guided by privilege; Jason shared his cut w/Tahani, because Jason, and he knew they'd need her ahead of the game}). Michael did this again and again; but he wasn't getting answers or successes. He'd 'heard' Eleanor and Jason had died so got them in for the big project, but kept messing up and causing biased results because of his favouritism for himself and them. So he tried Chid-ing by putting in 'himself' in the mix as a 'whole' again with the other parts/folks (*of himself*). His thinking was that Chid-he (I nailed that referential name!) would be good enough, because 'he' got good enough once before, and in essence he was the same person as Chidi 'before-life' (like a clone without the DNA, but compromised because of differing privileges in appearance); Chidi is equivalent to 92 cents (% sense?!) of a Michael-Dollar.

""Angel""-Michael and/or Shawn constructed a difficult 'earth' life for ""Chidi"" (and tried fruitlessly 'guiding' the other newmans, on earth) where he learned every lesson as hard-won (by design, for him a ""God exists""); and Michael, after he second-afterlife grew up as a demon (I'll get to that, trust me?), ended up detached from the instinctive good-sense he'd cultivated, in nurturing himself and his needs as well as others and theirs. He wanted to idolise ""Doug Forcett"" as ultimately selfless, presuming that meant flawless, and didn't remember/doesn't know at that stage, that *HE* had created DF for teaching; his boss ""Dave"" (or Shawn/Gen) potentially 'plays' DF on earth as following all the rules of society, but who's still doomed to fail. Later, back on earth then-SE3-Michael (but really Janet) identified DF as a happiness pomp along the way, he had moved well beyond Doug Shellstrop, but still was no 'Angel'.

Shawn is playing his role of personifying a boss to beat, where the character has to level up enough to challenge/overthrow them (Dave is above that, but still a ""Michael"", for Schur?!;  though they'd do better to work together), as neither are *there* yet, there's some jealousy/rivalry in Shawn not wanting his apprentice-self to succeed, where he/his-himself had not yet succeeded. Shawn is acting as who Michael (thought he) 'wanted' to be (based on his then-demonised existence), because that's what he needed to be, and who he needed to see, respectively/perspective-ly.

Our-Michael/DougS (MD) is doing the experiment on his character-selves (I am straight-up 'calling out' Michael Schur here for the 'meta-four' he's included in every character creation in the Schurverse) in a virtual reality afterlife, to prove that he/anyone can, 1. Learn to be a complete demon, 2. Unlearn those truths and 3. Re-learn to be a complete angel, and hoping that the same lessons apply on 'earth'. Additionally, so he can prove to himself that both scaling the summits, as well as exploring the depths of humanity, is possible for any being, and that character is a fluid (goo) concept, especially given enough time and information. 

A step above Michael-Shawn a more ""evolved"" ""Michael"", is a ""Dave"": who's human, gets it, has no powers/magic, who's willing to love every bit of unique insanity that is humanity. He's gentle inspiration without judgement, enthusiasm without irritation, and invitation with requirement.

I think Michael wanted this so much, as he thought it would be a true and applicable test of himself/humanity, where no one else gets hurt/used, it's all a simulation for him, no one is getting physically tortured inside his head (they're all roleplaying per the script); but it's real to him/his character, he believes beings are in pain everywhere, that he and they have fears and unknown, and none of it is right or just under the current system. 

So, (going back, as promised) ""Angel""-Michael, to preserve the experiment, wiped *ALL* of his memories, so he won't know what he's planned for himself, and leaves himself in his own hands, he's the only being who's no lifetime history (the demons' back-stories are true, they were 'good people', just not good enough by our own collective impossible standards). He grows up from the beginning of time (day dot) in his simulation, is an apprentice, learns the confines of the existence he inhabits, believes it to be real (likely after extended solipsism), and is given his 'first' project (one he'd already designed, he designed it the same as before, but this time, he doesn't know Eleanor and Jason's origin. AM had planted fake briefed files, destroyed the originals, kept Eleanor's essence in a cactus while our-Michael was also ""growing"" (Jason lived as all the plants; each became their respective 'philes'). Janet voluntarily perma-deleted all her sex-files/sex-philes, (reproduces asexually now), and her knowledge of her relationship to Jason (thinking it'd prevent inevitable betrayal or rather an-Oe*dip*al betrayal!), and booted herself to join him when he was himself again.

A-Michael was going by his previously learned faith, that *he* would focus on *self*-improvement and not rely on future generations to fix things, but then, when he was born again as Our-Michael, and taught 'the system', because it is true on earth, so is as infallible (massive fallacy, he's in a simulation) as is possible in his worldview. In real-life where we identified the ""Just World Hypothesis/Fallacy"", consensus is unfortunately, that anyone who is not succeeding, is only 'failing' as a result of their own actions (they are bad people) and they earn and deserve their losses as much as their wins, it's our flawed model, but the only one that's real, it's still a popularity contest, full of biases, privilege, and loopholes. 

O-Michael has more 'recently' bowed to reason/logic, and identified an inherent problem with the afterlife, he is learning (being self-guided, in a sense, just by a better evolved him-self), and his nudges toward ""true-North"", in navigating with a moral compass before its settled are good; but all of it means little outside that examination, the tiny sliver of life-pie he can carve out. All the magic, is effectively cheating, and it can't be replicated on 'earth', either anywhere in the Schurverse for non-Janet's, or real-life for ""The Good Place's"" audience. The lessons are not applicable outside the afterlife (show) because there's not (movie) magic for us, we are not all gorgeous (""you can do it for free"" in your head only), we can't row out into a CG lake, or bond with a penguin, we don't control our environment; constructs like money exist, as much and as valued, as any social construct we've historically recognised and assimilated for Gen-erations. The experiment is doomed to fail, because the parameters cannot be replicated, and there's no evidence that there's a divine judge/guidance figure we should fear/follow to be on the right track, or for anything after our real-lives. As for deities, if we believe that/one/many/none to be true, ultimately it's still our own impossible standards halting progress, when we don't practice what good is preached; we are the reason people don't just ""pass the bar"" (P.I. -Pun Intended) for existing, one problem is in setting a proverbial bar at all, but particularly one so impassable that it's off its scales.

I don't think that suicide is always helpful (or always unhelpful) or that it's ""the (real) answer"", to the trolley, or any problem; the trolley problem isn't even a pertinent question, because those aren't decisions we make day to day, on such monumental scale (where our self sacrifice, means potentially saving others). 

It's a thought experiment for ""worst case scenario""/doomsday scenarios, but the things that rack us up 'points' (as and when we judge ourselves, the judgement we usually trust in most), and keep us moving at all; are the little boring choices and leaps/steps, like choosing to eat a sandwich that we believe doesn't mean further lining the pockets of a person who is a current bigot; and then repeating and improving that for every sandwich that follows. They're cumulatively 'good', but **collectively huge**. Consumer power works, yet we all feel powerless as individuals as we often want a bigger part/role/reward/dessert, above us getting a fair and even share of the figurative gold and/or glory. 

If we invite more people on board to journey an arc -I call it the friend-ship (tangent: the relations-ship *wiggles eyebrows suggestively* is fun, like a port of call, in a potentially infinite existence, but it's not a solid ""home base"" {I don't know baseball so you'll have to settle for ship puns, for the shipping we do to characters and ourselves})- it may be a terrifying body of blood, and not one of water, that we're navigating in our arc, but if we batten down the hatches when we need to, and manage to weather the storms, it might become the blood of our covenant (reportedly ""thicker than the waters of the womb"", sounds pretty goo to me!).

Fewer people cast aside/thrown overboard, means less work we have to do individually; we can swab the deck with a damp squib instead of using it as a dry writ and sinking when we blow up (too meta-four-ish? Mea culpa!)

We dock people ""points"" when we judge them without subjective understanding; they dock their own points, when they don't succeed in conforming. All the while we individually and collectively, judge, demonise, and condemn; we also show kindness, love, and loyalty. Problems with the first set are clear, I think, the problems with the latter set become apparent, when that high value to some beings, comes from/with designation of/resignation to, a low value assignation for others (accounting for the losses). We are all a grab-bag of genetics and chance, and cooked in privilege, we *are* all equal, we just need to start to treat people like that's true across all the boards.

Connection and community is important, but group segregation and superiority make us cross-over battle-ships, and we start seeing those outside our ranks; as flotsam and jetsom that merge, till what was knowingly thrown or jettisoned overboard is indistinguishable from wrecks that come about when things blow up in our faces (for the pun record, that's not yet canon, but it is representative of my 'cannon' for the purposes of this post). It's a cocktail, it needs at least some ""mixers"" to be successfully mixed; or a chilli/melting pot, some sweet-looking peeps are probably OK, but no one wants a saccharine serving every day! We're usually concerned only with 'lightening the loads' of ourselves and the others we associate with, but that begets seemingly irreparable divides/unbridgeable chasms. ""You're not better than me"", carries to ""I'm not better than you"", drawing arbitrary fixed lines for damnation, and holding impossible standards (interpersonally &amp; intrapersonally) leads to failure for all, regardless of whether or not the tests end, the experience can be *""Lost""* (per backlash for that show)

We probably really only need to learn the errors of *our own* ways, not the errors of everyone else and their ways (though either can become an unhealthy obsession), lest the weight of the world on our souls leaves us crushed down below. But we tend to avoid self-reflection (""Wait, I'm in there too? What is going on?!""- Maximum Baby-Derek), and introspection, especially on such a minute and detailed scale, because the ignorance of our ignorance is as close to bliss as we think is feasible; it's our dead-angle, and we need more perspective.

I think, for Schur and Co. they made a fantastic, detailed, and relevant show; the worry might be either that people don't understand the messages, or if they are not entertained by the messages enough at the same time, they won't watch it till the end and learn them all; if they feel they don't like where it's going, or don't relate to the subjects/see the improveable parts of themselves enough to change those aspects of their being. But the thing is, it's impossible to cover all the bases here, we can only cover the ones we know, and keep learning as well as teaching (while being mindful of the value of emotional labour).

I think the Chip Driver Mystery holds the same clues and hints as the Manifesto, but it'll be the accessible demon guide to 'be bad at being bad', they will tackle the Manifesto when they are able to absorb it, or, if and when it's relevant to them, maybe never at all, that's autonomy, baby!

Potentially Shawn-Michael, embittered from thousands of years of teaching without seeing success in the measure they wanted, believed their account of Brent in the manifesto was unfair (as he programmed himself to play him/Brent was his 3rd-life Doug Shellstrop-type existence); and Michael thinks it necessary as exemplary, because the demons need saving as much as the humans. 

Brent, in his existence, with his experience in learning about morals and ethics, despite not applying them by design, thought that people would get the absurd sexual references to Tahani  (""Scarlett Pakistan"" as much as the meta-fornicate ""Sexy Skyscraper"" we hear) etc. as satirical, and I think it actually is a good book, under the tropes and exaggerated characters, that are just tools of expression; but for the newmans and new-newmans (who doubtless didn't finish reading it), it'd crossed into being a negative dog-whistle. My guess is that only Michael finished it, but he didn't get half the earth references as he spent his time there only for other beings' good, but the book subversively taught him that learning from media is a good way for disseminating and dissimilation of ideas. He thought that meant *his* manifesto was needed behind 'enemy lines', but that's not what will show every being has value, having Brent's book of effort and redemption available to demons, will be like a ""Humaning for dummies"" book, and that's as necessary as are lengthy and detailed dissertations of speculation on unsettled science and reasoning.

My guess, Dave-Michael/Shawn-Michael or Bad-Janet, knew that the manifesto was not going to hold demons' attention, so they'll have sent down A Chip Driver Mystery as a jumping off point. The ""Demons"" will collectively ""leap into faith""/take their plunge(r), but progress may be slow, and that doesn't make it meaningless, it takes a lot of sandwiches to grow into a human.

If Brent came about as/was played by a now-somewhat-disillusioned Shawn-Michael, frustrated after thousands of years of waiting for himself (as Baby-Demon-Michael) to catch up to where he'd already got to before; his ""I'm sorr-"", could have ultimately been for not believing in (kind of) himself; if he had participated, he'd have given the incremental test a win, but they get the win they need (a not-loss, there's no big win, and nothing behind the velvet rope, we just have to do and enjoy doing the work whenever we can). 

Our-Michael, for once *not* being coddled into a win by outside forces/using magic, confesses *ALL* his lies and manipulations to and of his friends, and where they came from; they're all real to him, they've all changed him, and he doesn't know exactly where he's going, only that he desperately hopes he's on the right track, and wants to keep learning. He freezes, his experiment is over, and he truly learns, earth is what we make of it, and anyone good wouldn't want to be locked away safe, they'd want to spend their existence getting everyone up to par (""What a twist!""-Brent-Shawn).

""The Good Place"" and the Schurverse remain as binary stars, beacons and illustrations, of chaos and hope, that appear as one; in the form of the shows made and ones to come (and even immortalised again in the background of the unedited version of the new Joker movie in billboard form); right now, the 'verse shows us the **possibility** in appreciating art (also it's Tuesday, and sometimes never). 

Additional foil for my plan(t)s: If/when he retires, Michael evolves into/is borne unto Michael-Dave ,who heads to earth to try human-design, marries Eleanor's mum (effectively again, for 'good'), adopts the next-Gen as Patty (who will be Chef Patricia in the future-past of the afterlifecycle, I hear she makes a good dessert!. And the cycle continues 'ad infinitum', every character has a full story, if writing our own, we need to hang on to the patent-pen (patent pen*Ding*).

Whether there is till the end of time, or the end of *our* time, to get good, it's worth doing it the right way, as much and as well as we can.

If you've read all this, congratulations, and I'm sorry. I hope it makes some semblance of sense!

TLDR:

Always paddle your own canoe""
Stay goodly, be goo,
Canoes can carry more than two!

* She intentionally chose the meanest way possible to criticize Brent on his book, even stopping Elenore from going about it in a nicer way just to take out her own frustrations on him
* Her sense of humour was messing with people on subjects she knew they had sensitive feelings about
* She intentionally chose the meanest way possible to criticize Brent on his book, even stopping Elenor from going about it in a nicer way just to take out her own frustrations on him
* She secretly observed her fellow humans for a year, which would count as a violation of trust and an invasion of privacy
* She left Brent to die merely cause she didn't like him

And what good did we see her do? Warning her fellow humans about her suspicions, but only after the aforementioned secret observing.

And what'd we see Brent do that was so bad, just spent a year acting as a self-absorbed jerk and writing a crass book, but he genuinely didn't know how bad he was acting and the only part of the book he had any idea would be unflattering was the character he based Chidi off, and even then he thought Chidi wouldn't be able to tell

We are kind of led to believe that the Judge is basically a God like figure. She seems to be the ultimate authority, she is neutral, she is one of the original elements, makes sense. So it was odd when Janet was able to steal the Judge's human destroyer clicker thing and the Judge actually has to physically go look for it. Which means she isn't all powerful. As many mention as well, throughout the show there is no mention of God, which makes sense from a network perspective because bringing religion into this would make the show a little sticky. But then who is the strongest person in the universe?

Currently,  probably the judge. But I think after all the Janets ( Good, Bad, Neutral, Disco) side with humanity, they will combine to create a super Janet. All Janets are already all knowing and all powerful ( they know everything that happened and can materialize any item fron thin air). We are also reminded she is not man or woman or robot, kind of how many see God (beyond what we understand of physical form). 

This new super Janet will be a combination of Good, Bad, and Neutral Janet (and I guess quirky?). She will know good and evil and because of neutral Janet she will be able to judge fairly. She is also the creator, the preserver of life and the destoryer of life. Good Janet created her own ""babies"" and preserved her own neighborhood and now she has the device to destroy humanity (if she manages to keep it from the judge and she also violently ate all her babies). 

I think by the last episode all Janets combine to make some sort of supremem being and she will install a new system to save and judge humanity.",50,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have couple in mind. 

1. Posthumous Attorney system. Once a person dies, whatever his/her point is, the ""defendant"" gets an attorney who knows *everything* about your life and your personality. That attorney can be either someone who's been through experiment like our cockroach gang, or a million-time-rebooted Janet. The ""prosecutors"" are going to be another bad Janet AND one person from the bad place who also is an expert at ethics like Chidi. The defense attorneys are going to argue why the person either never had a chance to grow morality in their lives or ""did much better than the point indicates"", while the prosecutors are going to argue that the person doesn't deserve another chances, i.e. ""there are others that were in same environment who did better"", or ""one's innate personality is not other's fault"". This system may be able to help both genuinely good people and mild dirtbags who can redeem themselves like the Cockroach Gang, while weeding out genuinely bad people. 

2. After the trial, unlike the normal trials we are familiar with, the defendant will be placed in an artificial setting with a pending verdict. The person will have its memory of trial removed. Whatever that place may be, it will not have any factors in that person's life that the ""defense"" and ""prosecutor"" determined to have hindered the person's moral progress in their lives, and will have what they should have had, i.e. loving person, friends, someone with ethic expert like Chidi. IT DOESN""T HAVE TO BE A FALSE GOOD PLACE. It can be a completely different universe, parallel universe of our own, dystopian world.  

3. The person will be given challenges that reflect that person's defining moments that compelled him/her to be a bad person by bad place, but this time, there will be people to support the subject and even criticize the subject should that person rebound to his/her negative actions that the subject had committed. These will be significant part of progress report. The experiment can run for a year. 

4. If the person's moral progress came as net positive, the experiment will continue until the person becomes ""good"" enough for the good place. If the progress is net negative, then the person will be removed, regain the memory of the trial, given verdict of ""loss"" ,and be sent to the bad place.

I've seen dozens of upvoted comments calling him a racist, nazi, psychopath and so on.

PewDiePie has made mistakes in the past concerning the N word, that's absolutely true. But he owned up to his mistakes, apologised several times and started actively working on himself to get better! He got into asian philosophy, stopped drinking and started practicing a more meditative lifestyle.

And as for him allegedly being a Nazi, that's just untrue. He has made some jokes in the past that have been blatantly twisted into some sort of manifesto by the media.

He also did a shout-out to a small YouTuber who he didn't realise was also a Nazi sympathiser. A mistake on his part, 100%. He had to check thoroughly before advertising someone on such a huge platform.

He again apologised and admitted his fault.

From these two incidents forward he hasn't done a single racist or anti-semitic remark in a video.

So my question is, how can we, as fans of a series that celebrates self reflection, personal betterment and improvement, criticize someone that is so clearly working hard on himself and admitting his mistakes?

Now that all those pieces are in place, we got episode 8 where so much of the slow build-up pays off.

Each of these 4 represent what is wrong with the current system or how to fix it.

John got better when he was given a real friend. He had it in him to be good, he just needed a chance and someone to go through it with.

Brent got worse. Way worse actually. Positive reinforcement enabled his bad behavior. He ended at -1% after a huge positive spike in the end. It took him learning that he was a bad person and deserved punishment to understand he had to change.

Simone didnt change at all really but she still got a 12% boost. Why? Because she was removed from the evil happening around the world that she was unknowingly participating in. She is the control for the experiment to measure the bias which appears to be about 12% per year of living.

So what is Chidi? He is the answer. The answer is that there is no 1 answer. Indecision is actually a good thing when it comes to morality. Just like each of the three test subjects needed something different to improve, changing 1 single system for another is wrong and only Chidi will see that you dont need to change the point system, you just need to punish the bad and give others a chance to be good or remove the variables that they cant control and treat everything on a case by case basis but keep watching and see reward improvement.

The problem with the Judge is that she's too caught up in her omniscience to admit she could be wrong until it was shoved in her face via her trip to earth in season 3. She's the all-knowing Judge, after all, how could she possibly be wrong? And although she's willing to be flexible and reconsider the current points system up to her ruling...it happens again. Janet rebels, and the Judge is so convinced of her own omniscience that she fails to consider that her immortal, omniscient perspective might be out of touch with the people she's impacting. And not to mention, she's so convinced of her own infallibility that she never recognizes that her unwillingness to do the work necessary to rehaul the system is only perpetuating the problem.

The Good Place people are too concerned with following decorum in order to distinguish themselves as ""good,"" and therefore they fail to do anything of impact. Not a lot to say here because there's no Good Place representatives we can really dig into the same way we can the Judge or Shawn, but the exchange in The Book of Dougs about ""Of course we have to observe all these rules, or else we wouldn't be in the Good Place!"" is a revealing one.

The Bad Place people are the closest to self-awareness in that they know they're d-bags and delight in it, but they're too busy trying to drag everyone else down to their level that they forget (or try to ignore) the fact that they need to drag people down means those people were above their level to begin with. The ""Selection"" short is reflective of this, where Glenn suggests ""hey, if we're actively trying to sabotage people from getting better doesn't mean people being irredeemable isn't the norm?"" and people brush him off with laughter. The Bad Place has a very South Park, thirteen-year-old boy on the Internet kind of attitude where offending and shocking people is cool and sincerity is stupid. (And no wonder Shawn cites PewDiePie as an example then, if I understand that correctly.)

The Janets on average have the least ego, being the afterlife equivalent of the Clippit assistant from old-school Microsoft Word. Notably though, they improve and grow with each iteration which might mimic humans' overall behavior as well! Which might be why they adapt so well to the cockroach cause, with Janet and Bad Janet serving as the exemplars.

Given all that, I feel like the show might be working towards eliminating sides like the Good Place and Bad Place altogether. That's just a guess though, I'm mostly just here for the ride and wanted to share my thoughts.

Further baseless speculation #1: The four humans are intentional foils to the afterlife factions (Simone for the Judge, Chidi for the Good Place, Brent for The Bad Place, and...IDK about John)

Further baseless speculation #2: If the Bad Place is going to stay intact but with significant restructuring, Glenn will be in charge by the finale.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

First of all Id like to point out that the Judges decision to cancel Earth is wrong, and quite frankly, a little stupid. What the experiment has proven is that humans and morality are too complicated to measure through a points system, and this will be true no matter what the Universe develops into. 

However, she is right in that the points system cannot accurately judge the level of morality of a person. And not in the way the Cockroaches were trying to prove, but just on a general level. Weve all been thinking that what the afterlife needs is a recalibration of the points system, but thats not the problem: the problem is the points system itself. 

Michael himself pointed this out: the points will tell you who that person has been, but not who they couldve become. Brent is the prime example: he sucked on Earth, he sucked more in the afterlife because his motivation was corrupt, but at the very very end, he got better. He started down a path of redemption. A system that awards points based on ones actions would never have been able to predict this. Here, many people on this subreddit thought Brent was going to be doomed to the Bad Place a couple of episodes ago. So Brent is living proof that the points system doesnt work not because humans lives are too messy, but because humans themselves are too unpredictable due to their capacity to change. 

It sort of comes down to the argument Chidi and Simone had last episode: if you give someone a thousand chances to be better and the result never changes, does that mean that they are irredeemable? Weve seen that thats not true through Brent. But the points system, any points system, is much closer to Simones philosophy than Chidis. No matter how you spin it, a points system will always look at what a person has done, not at what they could do, because people are impossible to predict. Theres always a chance that they might get better, so shouldnt we try a thousand and one times, just in case?

This all means that the Answer next episode has to be something entirely different to the points system. A purgatory-type afterlife in a controlled neighborhood to attempt to improve humans (like the experiment this season) could work. The truly complicated part of designing it will be to determine when a person is truly beyond any help, and will never get better, and therefore deserves to go to the Bad Place.

Team Cockroach are radicals, they don't want to reform the point system, they want to abolish it. This is contradicted in the latest episode where Michael says he just wants to reform the points system, but everything else points to him being a radical who wants to abolish the point system so I'm just going to write that off as bad writing (sorry). You might think the Judge is also a radical, judging by her plan to cancel Earth, but what she really is is the equivalent of the people who think that Thanos was right -- she presents herself as the ultimate radical but she's not actually changing anything. She gives off the illusion of being a radical without actually being one. The Bad Place are the people who are actively trying to preserve a broken system because it personally benefits them, with little regard to how it affects others. The accountants are preserving the system not because they're malicious but just because it's what's there, it's all they know. The Good Place are the people who thinks that the ends don't even matter compared to the means. They don't like the way things are, but they're so caught up in being civil that they're unable to make any change. 

So judging by all this, how should the show solve these problems? Well, obviously Earth isn't going to be cancelled. And the point system has to go. Perhaps Earth itself could be changed but I don't think that's likely, not just because it'll be really controversial but also because it doesn't really fit the main theme, at least to me. The main theme of The Good Place I think isn't ""it's impossible to be a good person in this world"" (that's certainly a theme, but it's not the main one), it's rehabilitative justice is better than punitive justice. What I think is that the afterlife will be structured around rehabilitation. It will not be structured around rewards and punishments for things that you've already done. There will be no Good Place or Bad Place, it'll be whatever makes you a better person.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

We've seen that given the right opportunity or support, pretty much any human can improve.

So, what about a solution that focuses on opportunities to better one's self, such as a karmic solution?

A human is born and experiences life, making a series of choices until their life is no longer. Based on their choices--perhaps with an improved point system--they transition into their next life. If they did well overall, they are rewarded with a slightly better life, and can continue to improve. If they do not do well, they are given a more challenging life, attuned to their weaknesses (for example, a well-to-do person who looks down on those who aren't of means might be impoverished in their next life).

These cycles continue and continue until the end of the universe, at which time a soul is judged. Over time, given the right opportunities, humanity should trend up. Those who run The Bad Place would be adept at identifying opportunities to correct those in need at each life. Earth effectively becomes a giant new-and-improved Middle Place to play out this new system. Those in The Good Place (and/or our protagonists) become referees to ensure the new system plays out correctly, as well as fine-tune the system or improved lives.

And at the end of the universe's existence, all of humanity should be in a position to go to the legit Good Place. This would even include those demons of The Bad Place working on the new system, as that work serves a common good. And by that point, they should be in the right mindset to welcome going to The Good Place, mirroring the way even Bad Janet changed.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Demons shutting down the fake good place to make more giving no escape from real torture: 

Break into the Judges chambers or as Michael puts it attempt something futile with a ton of unearned confidence


Find out that you have been reincarnated by your Demon/BFF and his not a girl assistant from another afterlife to prove that you can improve but by knowing this youre now doomed:  

Try to do good anyway 

And finally when faced with the unimprovable Brent and an advanced Bad Janet:

Just keeping trying 

The answer to life (as the show puts forth) is no matter the odds, no matter how hopeless, just keep trying. And if you failed today try again tomorrow.

Humans in the afterlife should be presented with the same challenge to defeat the Bad Place, perhaps save a demon from their old ways, and then (in their minds)  save the human race by designing a new system for the afterlife. 

They can then be judged on how ethical/  kind / moral  their new system is and their motivations behind saving the human race. The system will set in motion limitless variations on the happenings of The Good Place.

No idea if its a common theory or not (but honestly everytime someone says that it is TOTALLY a common theory, so I'm assuming so) but if it's not, I'll try and make my evidence new and exciting.  


So I was casually contemplating life and the Good Place, as one does, and I realized...the Torture Never Stopped. Michael pitched a new, innovative idea to torture humans for 1000 years. I think it's not over. I think we're still In The Bad Place.

Let's Review some Facts!

* Michael pitched a new torture method that would last for 1000 years. By show admission, it has been nearly 1000 years thanks to all the reboots and the jeremy bearimy nature of the afterlife. Which means we might be coming up on his deadline.
* Even AFTER they ""escaped"" the torture scenario, the Soul Squad has NEVER been happy. Oh sure, for small stretches they've been content. They had the experiment in Australia which was a pretty chill time. And Eleanor had that one reboot where she was in love with Chidi...
* Except, even that happy memory, of her loving Chidi, was used to TORTURE HER because she knew how telling Chidi would affect him, and it threw her feelings all up in a wack.
* And let's not forget that the Australia Experiment led to them ultimately having to face their mortality, and the sheer panic and anxiety brought about by telling them none of their choices mattered and their afterlife was borked! More torture!
* And when they finally got to ""The Good Place"" it was actually just the Mailroom. Eleanor has a breakdown because of how close she was to the Good Place. WHY could that door not open except as a form of torture for her?
* Then they summon the council and they are useless.
* When they go to the judge, and only Eleanor passes her test to get into the Good Place, it again causes her emotional distress. THIS IS THE 'CHOOSE TWO' PROBLEM ALL OVER AGAIN, aka, the test that made Eleanor realize she was IN THE BAD PLACE! Only this time it was aimed at us, the viewer, and WE were supposed to realize she's still in the bad place!
* Then the Experiment. Oh boy. Eleanor finally reveals her love. She and Chidi are good. And so what do they do? They get him to MINDWIPE HIMSELF, so that, again, Eleanor is the only one who knows about the love. Again, distress.
* Michael even admits that he faked the Breakdown so she'd take over the Experiment, and thus, cause herself more pain. He's still manipulating her after all this time!
* But then. Then they tipped their hand. They revealed the ""This IS THE BAD PLACE!"" to Chidi and Brent, in an attempt to manipulate them. After having tortured them pretty successfully for a year. Only it was all a lie. A fake to force them to respond a certain way. A way they KNEW would happen. What if Eleanor's original ""Bad Place"" was sort of the same? That's when it clicked. Tortures within Tortures. Games within Games. Jeremies within Bearimies. THIS IS STILL TORTURE!

This is all pretty damning. The Soul Squad has never had a moment of peace. They are clearly still being Tortured or Forked With. By who? I don't know. But are you ready for the kicker? The real showerthought born out of all this?

It is Possible that Only Eleanor is Real.

Mic drop. The biggest tortures. The biggest burdens. The reason she became defacto leader. Because this is HER torture. What torture can be so great as to torture a true scumbag like Eleanor was? How about getting her to begin to care about people other than herself, to want to be a better person, and then, once she is attached to people, to keep crushing her. Again. And Again. And Again. For eternity? It's cruel. It's eternal. It's horrible.

Now, it may be possible that this is all an elaborate test, the truest test to get into the Good Place. The point system WAS flawed, so they made up this insane test, essentially ""okay, how would you design the afterlife"" as the test to see who was worthy. And the hardship is necessary to see how the selected human or humans respond in crisis to really test them.

It's also possible that this is an interview process to be an actual Architect. That Eleanor has been on the biggest job hunt of her life, and this is the culmination.

It's also, unfortunately, possible that this is all elaborate torture, for just Eleanor or the whole Soul Squad. And that when they hit 1000 years (in the next few episodes) that they'll reveal the 1000 year test of the new torture system to be a success. And everyone will cheer, and you'll see Chidi look at Eleanor then do an evil demon laugh. And Jason will stop acting stupid. And Tahani will make fun of her. And then maybe they reboot Eleanor, and the last thing we see in the series is her waking up to: ""Hi. Everything is Fine.""

It will be neighborhoods just like Michael's original one, except instead of being designed for torture, they're designed to improve people. 

As of s4 e8 all Janets are apparently now on Michael's side already, and there are likely also many demons like Glen, who were won over by Michael's speech at demoncon, or through the book or other general dissatisfaction with the old system, who could help support the new system. 

So basically instead of eternity of torture, it's eternity of being made better in neighborhoods specifically designed for that purpose and specifically populated by people chosen, not like the first four who were chosen to torture eachother, but to support, love, and improve eachother. 

As Michael says in s4 e8, humans all have the capacity to improve if they get the love they deserve. 

Maybe there will also be a place where demons have a chance to improve, too.",19,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1) Meeting people the normal way; when Chidi wishes he had met Eleanor a ""normal way,"" and then in the new timeline, that is how they meet.

2) Mailmen obsession; the mailman poster, the mailbox fire, Chidi in the mailman costume, and Chris the demon having been a mailman as a living human.

3) The Chaos sequence, two parts; the call-back for Brent is part a, but part b is Eleanor's easter eggs- being a girl from Arizona, she wears an Michigan shirt to bed, and having gone to college in Tempe with maroon and gold being the university's colors, the clothes everyone wore were blue and maize... the colors for MU. Bell is a Michigan native.

4) Chet; the flirting between Bell and her real-life husband, Shepard. 

5) Almond milk

6) Wedding music; the song played at their wedding is the song that plays when Jason asks for cartoons in Janet's void, and accidentally pulls up his and Janet's digital wedding album

This post contains spoilers for those who have not watched the funeral to end all funerals!

So the judge said that she was just going to restart humanity. This made me think about the fact that in the first season Michael re-started the neighborhood countless times and no matter what Chidi and Eleanor ended up together and the gang realized that they werent actually in the good place. 

This made me think if the judge pressed the button to restart humanity what if everything happened exactly the same? What if she restarts humanity and it leads the four of them in the courtroom with Michael trying to figure out a new point system? What if this is the millionth time that Eleanor has mad bad choices so that she doesnt have enough points to get into the good place? What if its just one big loop that has been going on for eternity? Its the same as when Michael restarted the neighborhood! 

My other theory is that all the characters are actually living out their bad place tortures. I think I have read this theory on Reddit before so please point me in the right direction if this is a thread somewhere! But Michaels Hell is that he cant make a good enough neighborhood to torture people, Eleanor cant be with the person that she loves the most, Chidi might be faced with the task of creating a new points and deciding who is good and who is evil, Jason is also unable to be with the person he loves, and Im not totally sure what Tahinis struggle is.

Season 1 Ep 9 (Someone Like Me as a Member)  introduced Shawn as the eternal ""judge"" as the way to rule over whether Eleanor would be allowed to stay in the fake Good Place, ultimately leading Eleanor to realize that the Humans are in the Bad Place. Importantly, the Humans agree that they should defend Eleanor because she has honestly tried to improve herself.

Season 2 Ep 9 (Leap to Faith)  introduced the shutting down of Michael's neighborhood and Michael's gambit to save the Humans from being sent to Bad Place, ultimately leading the Humans/Michael/Janet to fight their way to the judges chamber and argue their case that they have improved. Importantly, it showed the trust developed between the Humans/Michael and their belief that Humans point values did not reflect entirely whether they are good or bad.

Season 3 Ep 9 (Janets) introduced that Eleanor &amp; Chidi's love is inherent across reboots and Michael discovers that no Human has gotten into the good place in 500 years, meaning that something is wrong with the points system. Importantly, it sets up Michaels realization that the modern world is too complicated for the point system and that a new experiment must be conducted.

Season 4 Ep 9 (The Answer) obviously therefore has to set up the final conflict for the final 6 episodes based on what has been established in the previous episode. Importantly, it will pivot from what has been the plot/moral focus of the first 7 episodes of the season. 

The most likely pivot would be Brent, who got demonstrably worse throughout the season save for the final minutes of the experiment were he had a genuine realization that he was a good person. Chidi now has the burden devise the ""answer"" for a better afterlife. Chidi was both the only person who stayed to help Brent when he was stuck in the sinkhole despite Simone, his ""soulmate"", saying that he is lost cause and ditching both Brent and Chidi. 

So Season 4 Ep 9 will likely result in Chidi in some way concluding that the purpose of the afterlife should be to unite people with a new kind of soulmate, someone who can force people to confront and understand what character flaw they have and improve it because the individual sees the value of self improvement for themselves and therefore those around you. 

Chidi and Eleanor's relationships brought out Eleanors realization that helping others before yourself is the best action; Chidi learned that being decisive in uncertainty (sacrificing his memory for the sake of the experiment) is the best way to help others, Tahani has learned that playing a supporting role instead of taking leadership vanity leads to better outcomes, and Jason learned that learned that being proactive and disciplined is better for those you care about (alright that one is stretch).   

To bring it all together, this next episode will find Chidi realizing that the afterlife should be where people are paired with soulmates who can best challenge each other to overcome the worst part of themselves and become their best person, pivoting the final episodes of the season to explore how meaningful and honest relationships result in people becoming good.

TL;DR: The Ep 9 of every season is the pivot between the main conflict of the season and how the plot will resolve itself. Chidi will realize that the relationships between the Humans and the new Humans in the experiment were set up in way that led to everyone facing their worst character traits and ultimately understanding how they can get better to help those around them. The last 6 episodes of the series will revolve around the characters determining what kind of relationships between people cause people to actualize their best selves.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have some questions going into the final episodes of TGP that Id LOVE opinions on.

1- What is *actually* up with Chidis almost total lack of flashbacks? Is this for a reason? Is there an upcoming Chidi reveal? Was he once a demon (one theory)? or a murderer or someone that was given a second chance to be good thanks to some kind of afterlife self-improvement experiment and thats why hes so obsessed with figuring out how to lead a moral life- to avoid eternal torture? When his memory is restored will that actually include MORE than the last 800ish years? Was he in fact a good place architect that was doing deep cover trying to figure out how to engineer the afterlife? 

2-  People keep theorizing about how Chidi will redesign the afterlife but its not the afterlife thats getting a redesign, its the points system used on earth. Could we up the algorithm or whatever from simple addition and subtraction to a little calculus and just measure the rate of change while on earth? Or do we measure the impact humans have on *other peoples* totals? Do people get assigned guardian angels like Michael to give them a push in the right direction?

3- ALSO. We arent dealing with strict questions of morality when designing a system of judgement with punishments and rewards, are we? We are discussing governance- and the idea that TGP is planning to present a plan for a morally perfect system of governance seems a little far-fetched... right?

Hopefully this will be allowed since I've heard from a lot of people that TGP made them want to learn more about ethics which is great.

I just remembered last night that there's actually a free Harvard course on philosophy available on YouTube. Like most people I don't really look forward to reading a dozen 1000-page doorstoppers just to learn more about a topic, especially when we're talking about books as dry and dense as philosophy texts. But I watched this whole series like a decade ago and it's a really great introduction for an uneducated viewer. You don't need any prior knowledge, you can jump straight into this.

[Justice with Michael Sandel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6) is an introductory philosophy course at Harvard that I think I've heard is their most popular course ever. This I believe is the fall 2005 course that's been recorded and is available free to everyone. There's also a [companion book](https://www.amazon.com/Justice-Whats-Right-Thing-Do/dp/0374532508/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1MEKFL30XN8WW&amp;keywords=justice+what%27s+the+right+thing+to+do&amp;qid=1574213507&amp;sprefix=justice+w%2Caps%2C202&amp;sr=8-1) which is a terrific read for prospective students.

It's an introductory-level class so of course we're not diving deep into the ideas like some books might, but it's a fast and engaging watch, the class is Socratic dialogue style (instead of the boring lectures I got at school), Sandel is an amazing professor and philosopher, and it's full of real-life cases and examples rather than just thought experiments. I highly recommend a watch for anyone who wants to learn philosophy.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

I only started watching TGP about a year ago, but I immediately got hooked. My first time watching I just thought it was a really fun show, but it wasn't until I started browsing r/TheGoodPlace that I really started thinking deeper about the show's themes and commentaries about morality and being a good person. 

Since then, I have taken little things from the show into my everyday life, and once in a while I would think back to the show and think about the morality of my actions a bit more, but recently *A Chip Driver Mystery* and *Help is Other People* really hit me personally. Michael's message at the end of *Help is Other People,* that sometimes the best thing you can do is be a better person than you were yesterday,  along with Brent's epiphany at the end of *A Chip Driver Mystery*  were scenes that have made me reflect on all the times I've been a Brent in the past (or an Elanor, or a Chidi, or a Tahani, or a Jason). Something in these couple of episodes made it click in my head that I have the worst impulses of all of these characters in my to some extent, and I want to get better. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not a total Brent, but I feel like there are times when I have... I can also have the selfishness of Elanor, Chidi's anxiety, Tahani's materialism, and Jason's ignorance at times. What I think this show has masterfully done is helped me (and hopefully others) to look in the mirror and realize these things, but instead of making me feel bad and gloomy it is genuinely inspiring to see how far the characters in the show have come, and it makes me want to make progress like them, one day at a time... 

Without the positivity of this community, I don't know if I would have had these realizations and taken action like I try to do every day, so thank you! You really never know how much just being a good person can impact others around you, and I've been trying to think about that more lately (without being a total mess like Chidi ofc). Today I'm happy with who and am and especially where I'm going, which hasn't always been the case, and although obviously things other than TGP have come into play, this TV show I just started watching one day because I was bored has done a lot more for me than I would've ever thought, so I was wondering if anyone else had had similar experiences...",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

In the last episode, we saw how they were about to wake up Chidi to solve the problem/riddle they are facing. Now, how is Chidi gonna make it? How is he going to convince the Judge?

First of all, when Michael gives him back all his memories, all his ''data'', he will know everything he's come through, how we can actually decide things. And we must remember: *The Judge does like Chidi.* She has always liked him, and if she's going to listen to anyone, it's going to be Chidi.

So, how is he going to convince her that earth should not be canceled? Earth should not be canceled because, as Aristotle stated, it was unfortunate, but it can *improve.* Earth was great, but because of its people got worse, so people have to *improve.*

So, essentially, they can no longer deem people good or bad by the side effects of their actions. They can't get better at what they don't know they're doing wrong. So, once they are dead, they have to prove that those ''negative'' points were because they had no idea, not because they were bad. How? Easy, *The* *Experiment Place.*

Basically, everyone who is currently going to The Bad Place should go through the Experiment first. Obviously, not everyone can go through that; murderers, rapers, terrorists... Those people should not be deemed worthy of it. Who, then, should choose that? I said it in the title, The Philosopher King. 

Then, there will be three places: The Bad Place; The Improvement Place and The Good Place. Therefore, The Philosopher King, or the new Judge, should be someone who knows philosophy, who understands it. But he should not be alone; as Plato wrote, not everyone should vote, not until they are philosophers, so, as Chidi gave classes and guided them, a group of people, the cockroaches, should vote and decide.

Finally, I'm not saying it's going to work, because it sounds like an end, and we still have some chapters left, so we'll face some problems on the way, but I think this is what Chidi will propose. Maybe is accepted, but the four of them are put back to earth, and the system goes on with their memories erased and Michael puts them together to thank them, who knows, this part is unclear for me.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Isn't it reasonable to say that the whole system of sorting humans into a good and a bad place is immoral? What good is caused by torturing billions of people for eternity.
Even if they all are actually horrible people, why cause so much suffering? Nobody on earth knows it's happening so it doesn't change any behavior there.
And the shows whole point is that humans can improve. Even if that may not apply to truly vile people like a certain youtuber, it would be kind of inconsistent to still have people be tortured.

Okay there was something that the judge said in the last episode that got me thinking. This post contains spoilers for those who have not watched the funeral to end all funerals!

So the judge said that she was just going to restart humanity. This made me think about the fact that in the first season Michael re-started the neighborhood countless times and no matter what Chidi and Eleanor ended up together and the gang realized that they werent actually in the good place.

This made me think if the judge pressed the button to restart humanity what if everything happened exactly the same? What if she restarts humanity and it leads the four of them in the courtroom with Michael trying to figure out a new point system? What if this is the millionth time that Eleanor has mad bad choices so that she doesnt have enough points to get into the good place? What if its just one big loop that has been going on for eternity? Its the same as when Michael restarted the neighborhood!

My other theory is that all the characters are actually living out their bad place tortures. I think I have read this theory on Reddit before so please point me in the right direction if this is a thread somewhere! But Michaels Hell is that he cant make a good enough neighborhood to torture people, Eleanor cant be with the person that she loves the most, Chidi might be faced with the task of creating a new points and deciding who is good and who is evil, Jason is also unable to be with the person he loves, and Im not totally sure what Tahinis struggle is. I think Janet is the one thats actually running everything too, not the judge. Like I said this last theory is a bunch of complied theories that I have read on reddit and in other places so I dont want to take credit for this one!

I'm sorry if I misinterpret things, I am no expert and am still doing a degree so if there's any philosophy experts that have completed degrees and want to correct me or disprove stuff I say, please do so. Learning from others is a big part of the show and I always like to expand my knowledge. 

Consider this, the whole reason it's called ""The Good Place"" is because ""Eutopia"" translates into it, while ""Utopia"", pronounced the same in the English language, translates into nowhere. The whole show is about the philosophy of being a good person, which is very much linked to this idea of a ""Good Place"". What is a ""Good Place""? What defines it? The question of what a good person is, is the crux of the entire show and so it must be questioned what type of place can be considered good. 

Personally, I feel things are quite off with the ""Good Place"" people we have been introduced to so far. I don't think I'm alone in thinking that these characters don't seem to want to push for the good of humanity or the good of the world, only focused on petty, short term issues that only cause things to slow down. If we are to take the show literally, bureaucracy is the greatest good in the Good Place. Or at least, bureaucracy is the best method to set up and control the good place. Which begs the question, if we the audience can clearly see that the good place presented to us is imperfect, how can it really be said to be Eutopia. 

This links back to my point on Utopia, because I believe that the characters are already in the Good Place and at the same time, there is no Good Place. The way that people seemed to improve in how good they were was how much they helped others with no other motive. And so, what is the best place to live therefore than constantly helping others for no other motive other than to help them. This is what I think the show's producers want us to get from the show, because it's clear they have a philosophical viewpoint and want to show us it, and I believe it is that a perfect world to live in is where you feel accomplished by helping others for no other cause than to help them.   


Therefore, the reveal at the finale will be that ""THIS IS THE GOOD PLACE!""",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

She thinks Michael might be an archangel. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean like I know the good place doesnt rely off of religion but they havent denied the possibility of any religious influences. I believe they said everyone had a little bit right so I think theres a possibility theres room for him to be an arch angel.

Michael is known for being someone who helps individuals prevail over evil and develop faith. Although its usually a faith in God I think in this case it would be to develop faith in goodness/fellow humanity. 

He seems way older than any of the other demons, it seems hes the least connected out of the demons, he genuinely sucks at being evil, and Michael is the archangel as far as Im aware that biblically has the most interaction with humans.

In subtler ideas I feel might back this: Michael is always wearing blue in afterlife scenes. Blue is the depicted color of Michael the arch angel. The only time I havent seen him wear blue is when hes pretending to be a human. 

Michael is also the archangel of crisis which in this case would be humanities complexity making it impossible to be good by the strict rules set in place. Although that wasnt revealed in season one theres a chance he knew that was the case already.

Another sign is reassurance, he provides a lot of encouragement not only to the group but has also had encouraging moments with each individually on their restart time on earth. 

The other two signs are fulfilling life purposes and relationships rather than spectacles. Each character has found a purpose in the afterlife that they lacked in life on earth. These purposes are formed through the relationships they develop in the afterlife. Michael has never taken the lead in the experiment but has supported the humans into doing most the leading work.

It makes me wonder if the experiment was happening all along and in two phases

1.) would divine intervention push humans to be better

2.) could humans push other humans to be better

I mean not my best work but really, he pulled divine intervention with their lives on earth that worked a little but not as much as the humans wanting to be better for each other. 

So although religion might encourage us to be better in the short run its really people that encourage us to be better in the long run.

Ive used more of my catholic education on trivia and theory then I have anything else

It just kind of feels like the difference between cannon and non-cannon Catholics.

Like religiously intolerant people follow rules that just dont make sense because they want the good people points to go to the good place 

Cannon religious people prioritize other people, religious literature tells them to love other people and they do. They prioritize their relationships with others to become better people rather than rules written in a book long ago before the world got this complicated.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Judge seems nice, but she is just interested in humans (since she is sitting alone in her office for 14billion years) rather than having any sincere sympathy for them. Michael proved to her that humans can change for better in the last episode. But she already knew that. She said so herself after she tested them, sent them to the bad place without much thought since they didn't improve enough.  After that when it's apparent that system is wrong she just decided to reboot the Earth without much thought or compassion. It's mass genocide, it's worse than that, because it doesn't just kill every human, it wipes them out of existence.  Also she is not very competent to have this job. 

The Good Place people are just incapable to do anything, when something requires fast and decided reaction and can't be undone - they just hide and write a letter.  It's not necessarily bad, but they are hurting people through their indecisiveness - same thing Chidi got send to the bad place for. They weren't even interested why people don't get to them anymore for 500 years. Imagine same ignorance happening on Earth, would it be ""good""? Also calling all the bad place employees a disgusting monsters (something like that, I don't remember exact quote) is kind of racist. 

The demons are a easy target, they are pretty much jerks. The only one of them showing any improvement is Michael and Genn (although Genn was probably just fed of with Shawn bulling him). They torture humans with would give them tons of negative points. This is their job, it's what they were made for. But a child raised to be a killer would still be judged as a killer by the system. And they had much more time to realize it's not what they should do. 

The accountants are probably the closest, they just work, some of them very hard, judging every weird sex thing. They also didn't think that something is wrong with all the mail going to the bad place. So same applies as to the good place people. And they got all the information to figure out something is wrong. Even if their point's total is 0 (neutral) it's still not enough sice you have to be a high number above that to get to the good place. 

So if they are not meeting their own requirements why they are so judgy when it comes to humans. It's not like they are any better. Even worse, since they didn't improve in any way in billions of years.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

if humans just go to an eternal afterlife after death then there would be no reason to sort them at all if they were never going to do anything else.

i mean if there is no ultimate purpose then why ever do anything, why even have a universe in the first place

if its all just ""because"" then why not just let them die, why not just let the universe be a big flash of random stuff and then eternal nothingness.

but that can't be the case, can it?

no, i refuse to believe that everything is meaningless. maybe, after some unimaginably long amount of time, the ""post-life universe i guess?"" would end as well and everything will pass on to an even higher layer of existence.

or maybe every being, after it dies (both times) it will reincarnate into another life and all life is one being simply playing out different parts of the overall universe, like in ""The Egg, by Andy Weir""

or maybe all of this is just an experiment on life itself, and even if within itself its all meaningless, overall its important. perhaps some eternal being has decided to create its own universe but wasn't sure how to do it, so it created two, one that would simply live and the other to determine how the first would be governed. and once all of this is done, finally the ""True"" universe will be created, perhaps with all of the same life, maybe without life at all, maybe this is just the first (or one of the first) of many experiments to be done on the universe

or maybe it is all just a big accident from some other eternal being who may not even know of our existence

or, maybe it really is all pointless and purposeless, but even then, does it really matter? does it all need to have a purpose? cant it just, be? there are countless possible explanations for what it could really all be but, we will never be able to find out until its all over, and maybe not even then! so why stress about it, just live. if we ever do figure it out, great! but we don't have to, if we can never know the truth, then let's just believe whatever we want to believe but just except that we will never know for sure and that all we can do, is live.

just enjoy your life and let others enjoy theirs.

Make your flatmate  
 A cup of tea

without them having to ask  
 

Call your Mum   
 at least once a week  
 Tell her you love her  
 and little else  
 Go on, make her day  
 

Recycle  
 Reduce. Reuse. Recyle.  
 Be kind to the earth  
 Be kind to animals  
 Yes, even the gross ones  
 

Go vegan  
 and ponder the ethcial ramifications of almond milk  
 Or at least try  
 

Keep trying  
 Be a little bit better every day  
 That's all anyone can really do  
 Try  
 

Have empathy  
 Recognize we all have a different history  
 but that doesn't have to dictate  
 our actions in the future  
 

Accept you are biased  
 We all are.  
 Learn to recognise it  
 and correct your assumptions  
 when you can  
 

Give to charity  
 Buy from charity shops  
 Reject mindless capitalism  
 Acknowledge there is no ethical consumption under capitalism  
 and then (if you are up to it)  
 start a communist revolution  
 

Or ..  
 just  
 Vote bench!  
 

DO NOT  
 VOTE TORY  
 

encourage others   
 TO NOT VOTE TORY  
 

Hold a door for someone  
 Give your spare change to a homeless person  
 or if you can't   
 just stop and have a chat  
 Little things   
 can make a world of difference  
 

Don't do it for the glory  
 you may never even recieve a thank you  
 Be good for goods sake  
 Be good because you can   
 Make that choice every day  
 even if all you get  
 is a warm glow in your stomach  
 and the knowledge you have done the right thing  
 

Have hope  
 even when all hope seems lost  
 

Read philosophy books  
 ask yourself  
 'What do we owe to each other?'  
 and realise   
 the answer   
 is everything  
 We owe each other the world  
 

Love  
 Love as widely and deeply as you can  
 Love hard  
 Long long  
 

Help people  
 at every opportunity  
 People are all we have  
 Be selfless  
 as selfless as you possibly can be  
 Know that people improve with love and support  
 and that we shouldn't hold it against them  
 when they haven't had it  
 

Be selfish when you need to be  
 You are important too  
 You can't save everyone  
 They must first want to save themselves  
 

Support your friends  
 in all of their endeavours  
 big or small  
 Be their biggest fan  
 their coach  
 and their cheerleader  
 all at once  
 

See the world  
 in all of its randomness  
 It's pandamonium.  
 Accept that time means nothing  
 It's Jeremy Bearimy, baby  
 Accept  
 that all you can do   
 is be here  
 Now  
 Live fiercely in the present  
 that is your gift  
 

Welcome the possibility  
 that there is no answer  
 to the meaning  
 of life  
 Not a poetic one anyway  
 Maybe the universe  
 is just some big, dumb, food processor  
 and we are all just going to die  
 

Become a nihilist  
 but a positive one  
 If it all means nothing  
 why not do some good   
 while you are here

  
 Be a Good Person  
 Not for some intangible God  
 or for a shot at getting into to heaven  
 but just because  
 you can  
 

And above all else;

Please add anything I missed!

___

Okay, Im sure this list is going to be incomplete, but here goes anyway:

* What is the significance of Chidis name?

[This has been speculated on so much its actually in our sub FAQ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/wiki/faq/names) In this episode we learn that its real significance is in giving Chidi his very first stomachache!

* What is Chidis background, what is his family like?

Chidi was the only one of the four humans whom we never got any background info on when they went back to Earth. We met Tahanis sister, we went to Jacksonville and experienced Jasons absurdist family in all its glory, we witnessed a heartfelt Ya basic! between Eleanor and her mom.

But over four seasons, all we learned about Chidis family is that he had a grandmother who made him peanut butter fish that Eleanor refused to try back in Chef Patricias restaurant.

In this episode we learned that Chidi is basically a clone of his dad, another tortured academic, and that part of his anxiety comes from his parents tense relationship, and his early desire to try to fix it with logic.

* Why did Chidi become a professor? Why philosophy? Why Kant?

To fix his parents marriage. He thought he prevented their divorce through his presentation, when in reality it just motivated them to seek counseling and to remember why they got together in the first place.

But what little Chidi took away from the experience is that there are absolute truths in the universe and that through enough study and examination they can be discovered, setting him on the path to becoming a Kantian.

* Why did Michael torture Chidi by making him choose between puppies?

In the reboot where he eventually wound up with Spencer the Owl [](#Owl) he couldnt decide between two heaven puppies. Eleanor tried to get him to relax before settling in for the long haul with the iguana [](#Iguana) that kept pooping on her.

Anyway, Chidi briefly mentioned that one of the puppies reminded him of the one he had as a kid, but here we get the full storyhis parents got him the puppy as a thank you for healing their marriage.

&gt;It worked?

&gt;[](#Chidi) Perfectly. Theyre happy again, Uzo. Theyre even talking about getting me a puppy. But more importantly, I proved once and for all that you can always find the answer.

&gt;The answer to what?

&gt;[](#Chidi) To anything. Every problem has an answer. If you just read enough books and think hard enough, you can figure out the answer to any question.

&gt;I know youre really smart, but that sounds wrong.

So many character-establishing points in this conversation. We have the puppy, the first chronological mention of his relationship with Uzo, (who accused him of filibustering through recess when he couldnt pick teams; who was his best friend who was getting married that he couldnt plan the bachelor party for because of his indecision; and who was there to witness his death by air conditioner) and we have Chidi articulating his new outlook on lifethat everything is answerable, because he just saw how it fixed a relationshipand Uzo, his grounded, practical friend, immediately seeing the flaw that Chidi wont acknowledge.

* Why is Chidi so bad at relationships? Why did he think his soulmate would be books?

&gt;Its just, why are we together?

&gt;[](#Chidi) Because it it makes sense. I mean, you like Kant. I like Kant.

&gt;Were not a book group.

&gt;[](#Chidi) I mean, but were not *not* a book group.

Its a recurring theme that Chidi drives his girlfriends crazy with his indecision and his compulsive need to reduce everything to philosophical discussions. It was in his torture montage when he realized he was in the Bad Place because he drove everyone around him nuts (his girlfriend and Uzo.)

And the cockroaches did begin as a book group! For once Chidis rigorously analytical approach to life worked out in everyones favor. It made Eleanor, Jason, Tahani and eventually even Michael better people, and it bonded all of them together. They became friends because they were a book group.

* Why did Chidi compare his mind to a fork in a garbage disposal after Eleanor told him she had feelings for him?

Because he dropped a fork down his garbage disposal right after his girlfriend left him. :(

* Did Chidi keep wearing those awful red boots?

Oh yeah. He wore them the night after his girlfriend left him and his advisor rejected his thesis. [](#Boots)

* Why does Jason have zero fear of commitment? Why is he so quick to propose?

&gt;[](#Jason) I mean, where Im from, most things blow up eventually, so I learned that when something dope comes along, you gotta lock it down. If youre always frozen in fear and taking too long to think about what to do, youll miss your opportunity and maybe get sucked into the propeller of a swamp boat.

* How old is Janet?

&gt;[](#Janet) Im infinity, but strange things happen in the afterlife.

Admittedly this answer makes no sense to me Janet must have been created at some point, ***Janets are brought to you by the makers of light, darkness, and everything,*** so how can she be older than her creators? I know, I know, [Jeremy Bearimy](#Jeremy) but I still find that hard to accept.

Maybe this can be explained with different relative values of infinity, [some infinities being bigger than others.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0) \\\_()\_/

* Why did Michael give the cockroaches that magic blackboard in **The Snowplow**?

Because other than ***The Answer*** its the one thing Chidi always wanted.

&gt;[](#Michael) I knew what you expected to find when you got here: answers. Also, if I recall from your file, a magic blackboard?

&gt;[](#Chidi) One that anticipates your lesson flow. Thats the dream.

Chidi is to a magic blackboard as Eleanor is to an endless shrimp dispenser.

* Did Chidi learn anything from Eleanor?

Plenty, but specifically he learned the trick about using Janet as a way to store a note to yourself to find your soulmate. :) Thats how Eleanor did it back when they were originally about to be mindwiped, in a copy of Chidis favorite book, ***What We Owe To Each Other.***",21,1,False,self,,,,,

No one on Earth knows the moral weight of their actions, because life has become so complex. Michael explains with flowers: hundreds of years ago, you pick flowers, give them to grandma, she's happy: **GOOD**. These days, you buy flowers, subsidizing slave labor, subsidizing pollution: we've learned it's good but it's **BAD**. In the past we could reason the moral weight of our actions from the environment. But today we can't.

And Chidi's book^* turns out to be about ethics in actual practice:  how humans these days engage in *learned* behavior rather than behavior that's a response to the *natural* environment. So Chidi's life is *about* the same problem they're now facing.

But if Chidi truly did a perfect job summing up the problem, and he covered every labyrinthine impossibility of making informed ethical decisions, that would explain the un-readability of Chidi's book. Accepting that Chidi still has huge issues in making decisions, now the incomprehensibility of the book *isn't* due to Chidi, it's due to the fact he's accurately describing the incomprehensibility of the universe- and people find that incomprehensible to read. 

*
(*The title of of Chidi's book is ""[Who We Are And Who We Are Not: Practical Ethics and Their Application in the Modern World: Moral Reasoning and the Human Paradox of Self Preservation in relation to the Social Contract: a Treatise on the Value of Universal and Mutually Beneficial Ethical Responses, as Displayed in Everyday Interactions](https://i.redd.it/eskb6vpyu7041.jpg).""*

&gt; *There is no doubt that humans practice self preservation with every breath and action. This is particularly evident when engaged in a mutually beneficial social contract, where humans display ethical responses only when it benefits themselves. This is a paradox because humans think they are engaging in self preservation, when in fact, they are destroying themselves and others by engaging in behavior based on learned theories rather than displaying behaviors that are a response to the natural environment.*

It's so well executed, too. Pretty much every main character has character development to make them a better person.

Michael: This one is pretty obvious and had the most impact.  He was a demon whose only job was to torture people. Then, as we saw throughout season 2, he became more remorseful and realized his mistakes and became a good person. He is now the voice of reason and I  think that's such a big change from him in the first two seasons and that's awesome.

Eleanor: She went from a ""trash bag from Arizona"" and incredibly selfish to one of the most selfless people in the show. Not only did she help save her friends multiple times, she's also working on saving  humanity, which season 1 Eleanor would never have even thought of doing.

Chidi:  This one became obvious to me in the most recent episode. He spent his life worrying about choices and answers. Then, clearly, he told himself ""There is no 'answer' but Eleanor is the answer"". Bro, that's deep. The development there speaks for itself.

Tahani:  Tahani is similar to Eleanor is development. She went from selfish to selfless. She stopped caring so much about what others think of her. She even dropped her grudge against her sister in season 3!

Jason: This one took a bit of thinking. I personally believe that Jason's development is his caring. He hasn't had too much development, ngl. He genuinely cares for his friends. And, hey, he's not robbing things or blowing them up as much anymore. 

Janet: Not a human, but she certainly acts more human. Her romance with Jason has given her human emotions and insight on what it's like to be human.

As someone whose defended this point many times I reiterate, we NEED to have faith in the writers. For over 3 and a half seasons they have constantly filled us with constant laughs, tears, and kept us on our toes. They have exercised brilliant story telling methods to ensure that were constantly entertained and always wanting more, and theyve NEVER let us down. 

Beginning to lose confidence in the writers who have successfully shocked us for nearly 4 years running while were so close to the end would be a travesty. Id like everyone to keep in mind that the episode following last nights fall finale will be the 5th to last episode of the season, as well as the series. Many people have cited that compared to last years fall finale Janet(s) which admittedly is a masterpiece, The Answer somewhat feels disappointing. But as I said during the live discussion, this episode NEEDED to happen specifically at this point. Throughout this season weve seen more growth from Team Cockroach then EVER before. Chidi has been absent to this growth unfortunately, as he made the tremendous sacrifice at the end of the last seasons finale and had his memory erased. Although he was already one of the members of team with the least amount of growth still needed, at this point in the story he had fallen behind in comparison to the monumental shifts weve seen from Jason, Tahani, Michael, Eleanor &amp; Janet this season. We needed this episode not only to further humanize our lovable yet paralyzingly anxious nerd, explaining to the audience truly why he is the way that is, but also to demonstrate why it is only now, after over 800 reboots that he can achieve this moment of clarity, growth, and peace. 

In addition, this episode served as an answer to almost every question thats regularly asked on this sub, as if the episode was custom made for r/TheGoodPlace.

I still think it's one of the best shows on television and a truly great piece of american writing that will go down as a classic. That being said...Did they lose some writers for season 4? Directors, show runners, ETC? Something has to have changed for the quality to have dropped off to such a steep degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Say what you want about the quality of the joke writing (pretty hit or miss for me personally), the pacing and narrative appears to have taken a dive. S1-S3 were great for a ***lot*** of reasons, but my personal favorite reason was the pacing. They never felt like they were ""milking"" a premise or plot point. What would have been an entire season of another show, **The Good Place** would accomplish in two episodes. Now that we are in Season 4 though, the pacing feels more like any other show. We just spent an entire episode (S4E9) that literally took place in 30 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

The inverse is also true in a few places. The writing seems to be NOT drawn out in places where it should be. For instance when the show demonstrated that Chidi and Simone were a couple via them kissing; they didn't address it at all with Eleanor. No dialogue from her, no emotional anguish (aside from the camera cutting to her for one second), nothing. And when he woke up from S4E9, the first thing he should have done was embrace Eleanor but instead he...asks for a note he wrote? What?! You just spent an entire year away from the woman you love and the first thing you do is greet your ""soul mate"" like she's a casual friend?  Then you ask for a note you wrote instead of immediately kissing her?

I still love the show and will obviously shout its achievements from the rooftops. The weakest season of The Good Place is still better than 99% of other shows out there. The 1% being The Last Man on Earth (Which also was too beautiful to last more than 4 Seasons) ;-)

**PS**: If they simply wanted to show what was in the note, the more elegant way would have been; 

*(after Chidi and Eleanor share an embrace)*

**Janet**: Chidi, I have the note you left with me

**Chidi**: Thanks Janet but...

*(Chidi looks into Eleanor's eyes)*

**Chidi**: I don't need it...

In Season 4 Episode 9, the ""answer"" is that there is no ""answer"" but Eleanor is the answer.  I'm going to be referring to the first context in quotes throughout this post and the answer being Eleanor version of the context without quotes so that we can keep them straight.  I know that there were no quotes on the note in the show.  So then what are the questions?  If one part of the note has a solution and one doesn't then they aren't the same question.

In Chidi's arc the ""answer"" that there is no ""answer"" was to the question: ""What is the correct way to live?""  The answer of Eleanor was to the question ""Can I ever be happy?""  Chidi and Eleanor don't make sense on paper, there is no quantitative reasoning or way to pinpoint why they should be together, but they make it work because it is important to both of them and they keep trying.  They love each other despite their differences.  So Chidi letting go of the idea of perfection in the form of a perfect mate has allowed him to realize that he has already found the perfect soul mate, he'll just never be able to quantify why she is and that's ok.

Eleanor has an ""answer"" that there is no ""answer"" too.  Her first question is ""How can someone be redeemed?""  Eleanor's story has always been about someone who feels undeserving, trying to make things right.  She attempted to banish herself to the bad place to save everyone else, she studied philosophy, she has tried returning to earth to fix things before her death, she has championed the experiment, she wants to make things right.  But the ""answer"" is that there is no ""answer.""  What has happened has passed, you cannot fix it.  So if Eleanor were to write herself that note, it would say that there is no ""answer"" but Chidi is the answer.  What is the second question?  ""How can someone improve?"" Chidi represents the idea that helping others to improve is how you improve yourself.  Chidi helped Eleanor every single time without fail.  Eleanor learned that what her mother is doing for her new family is improvement in the name of love, and even though Eleanor won't be rewarded for her mother's improvement, her half sister will.  Eleanor has to let go of the idea that fixing the past is more important than having a better future.

The retelling of Chidi's story from the beginning also retold the story arc of Michael in the background to bring it back to the audience's attention.  Michael knew the whole time that there was no ""answer""  to either Chidi or Eleanor's ""questions.""  There is no one way to live and you cannot erase the bad that you have done after it has happened.  But Michael has learned that humans aren't ever done developing and that they can always change for the better if given the right help, usually from each other.  So with respect to Michael's character arc, there is no ""answer"" but Michael is the answer.  Michael's first question is ""How should humans be judged?""  The ""answer"" is that there is no ""answer.""  You cannot quantify everything, just like Chidi learned with his answer (the second one, remember no quotes).  But what is the answer (no quotes)?  Well I propose it is Michael, or what Michael's story represents.  The problem with the previous system is that it treated humans like parts of a system instead of as individuals.  Michael has gone from a cynical demon that believes humans are scum to an idealist and an advocate for humanity.  The answer is to the question ""Who is best suited to determine what to do with all these humans?"" It is Michael.  Someone who appreciates improvement over perfection, basically the same thing as Eleanor's answer (no quotes).  Michael is best suited to replace the Judge and gain the new title of the Counselor.  Michael is how to fix the afterlife, he has learned to understand and love humans without being able to quantify it and without demanding perfection, he is the god figure who has learned to love us even if we cannot live up to the image of our creators and Michael wants to help us improve instead of simply judging us.  There will be no more good place and no more bad place, just the next place where humans go after they die on earth, where they are organized into communities, given warmth and support or called out when they are being bad and guided towards improving themselves and others forever.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

What we have learned from the experiments, successes, failures, and valid points seems to lead to a compromise of sorts.  How do you hold it against someone if they do not get what they need in life to improve?  It's not just love and support.  It varies by situation and life experience.  There is cookie cutter answer to create a good person, as evidenced by our very different cockroaches and second batch of test subjects.  Different strategies got through.  The Judge said it was not the points that were the problem.  It was how much of a mess it was down here.  But rebooting earth will eventually lead us right back to where we are now.  

Our cockroaches have essentially lived 800 or so lives in different circumstances.  They had to learn to lose, to win, to hope, and sometimes, to take a chance even if it may all just blow up.  They improved a little each time, but they REALLY improved once Michael gave them back all their memories.  It took combining all of that experience for them to truly see each perspective and to be empathetic.

As we all know, each episode is a numbered chapter. We're not even given the episode names on the title cards. Just Chapter X ...

But even now I have no idea who's story this is and who's telling it? Is it Michael? Is it Eleanor? Shawn? Janet? Who's ""writing"" the chapters and from what book?

My working theory--based on how TV works--is that it must be either Michael or Eleanor because Danson and Bell were the two stars Schur pitched for their roles. As much as we love the others, they are all secondary characters. And since we know Schurhad the entire arc of the show from the initial pilot pitch, I have to assume either Michael or Eleanor is telling the story.

I just for the life of me can't figure out who. Sometime I think it's Michael because he is essentially the creator and catalyst of the ""sit."" But sometimes I think it's Eleanor because essentially we see the story from her point of view. (I.E., we didn't know about Michael and the Bad Place until SHE found out about it.)

So whattaya think? Michael or Eleanor? Or are you convinced a showrunner like Schur created a show being told by a character he hadn't yet cast?",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Let's consider how many Chidis there are.

Childhood Chidi: Intellectual child, who tries to be caring and thoughtful in a dispassionate way. Already indecisive.

Pre-Death Chidi: Completely dysfunctional and makes everyone miserable. Very thoughtful and ethical, but also, in practice, hard to live with.

""Everything is Fine"" Chidi: Better than he was on Earth; he is able to help Eleanor become better than she was. Still a bit unhealthy with the way his indecision manifests, but growing.

Eternal Recurrence Chidi(s): These are the Chidis that comprise about 300 years and 800 resets. Eleanor always finds Chidi and they both always improve each other, even going so far as to fall in love once.

Team Cockroach Chidi: This Chidi reformed Michael himself. He was even capable of going farther outside his comfort zone in the Bad Place infiltration. In the end, he fails Gen's test because he still cannot accept that you can't reduce every question to one answer.

Brainy Bunch Chidi: Capable of asserting himself. This Chidi covers a lot of ground, from when he decides to be more decisive, to when he decides a specific thing to do a paper on, to when he struggles through the existential nightmare of the Bad Place, to when he helps Eleanor realize who she is, and ultimately sacrifices himself for the good of the universe

Eleanor's Neighborhood Chidi: Demonstratively shows improvement over his original living self, willing to screw himself over to save a terrible person and also able to help that person reflect on his life and learn from his mistakes, which nobody else was even capable of.

Ultimate Chidi: Finally able to process all of the things he went through. He seems more serene and relaxed, able to bear the weight of the universe on his shoulders.

I love how the character has progressed. It's very well done.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

I've the first 4 episodes and noticed something, then went back to the pilot cuz i found something odd... The symmetry in scenery &amp; in the character's actions and behaviors...

All right firstly, please take a look at these pics:

[https://imgur.com/a/8FfAaYz](https://imgur.com/a/8FfAaYz)

You can see the recurring visual theme of ""balance"", ""symmetry"" is recurring. In fact there are more scenes where this is visually represented but i kinda picked just the more obvious/highlighted ones. 

Also, the circles in Eleanor room, the circular windows in her house, that art right above her bed, etc...A circle or sphere is symbolic of balance.

The scene where the ""big change"" is about to happen, meaning the events that anticipate her change ""deciding to become good"" is she looking throught a circular window, meaning looking throught a more balanced ""lens"" at the chaos she created by her actions while the background sound plays ""This is the part where i break free""... Free from what exactly? Free from unbalance. She doesn't like the world she created for herself and she wants to earn her spot in the Good Place. 

So she starts to act more selfless to balance out her selfishness.

She's the oposite of her soul mate (the black dude) who's all about duty and being selfless (spent 17 years doing some selfless work). But in the third or 4th episode he decides he wants to do something fun, cuz he needs that indulgence to balance things out too... And Eleonor helps him out on that side of things, just like he did to her. They're balancing each other out.

Also, the pakistanese girl is condescending because she thinks everyone else wants the same as her; To be noticed, recognized, and that's why she is so quick to make compliments and observations. To her it's a competition for attention and validation. All based on her past traumas. One particular scene that stuck with me was during the ""architect"" speech and she's all weird doing this gesture with her hands like over  emphasizing the guy... Lol that was funny. She's like.. ""Hey look here, this guy right here, pay attention to him, recognize him, validate him"" lol haha

Funny thing tho is that their bad sides is what drives them to want and become better - Eleonor knows she doesn't belong and wants to earn her place by becoming better. 

The pakistanese girl is somewhat a narcissist and is desperate to be seem, recognized, and her failure in relation to her sister (i'm not worth it, i'm bad) is what drives her to try and do so much  good on the earth. 

Eleonor realizes she doesn't belong there and decides she wants to earn her place, so her bad side drives to want and to do good things.

They both have a perception of what's wrong with them, and they act on it to perceive themselves as better people. 

If you think you're already good, either on one spectrum or the other (i'm good because i'm so altruist) - you tend to start shitting on everyone who has fun (indulges) as inferiors and start seeing your self as grandiose, someone who's supposed to lead others in the right path (extreme right, ""i'm righteous fuck everyone who's dumb and incapable of the right thing?) also, if you think only about indulgence and fun you go to the oposite extreme and become a nihilist/anarchist. 

So it's like they balance themselves out, and they balance each other out... I wanted to write something about the Monk guy but i couldn't exactly figure him out yet. 

That's it maybe i'm getting it all wrong but those are the first feels i got from this show.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Alright so I just got out of Frozen 2 and I have to say, Kristen Bell (Anna) was the best thing about it. I know shes excellent in everything shes in, i.e Good Place and Frozen 1. But theres something about her phenomenal performance in this movie that really struck me, and dare I say, made me cry. Not from sadness, but from her sheer emotion. THIS IS WHERE THE SPOILERS BEGIN. Ok so theres a scene towards the end of the film where Elsa basically dies or something, which causes Olaf to fade away (think infinity war style). This completely shatters Anna and she shows it. She desperately  grabs on to Olaf, begins to cry, and then begins to sing the best song in the whole movie. It conveys every emotion shes feeling, while hitting all the right notes. And this five minute clip from the movie makes me love Kristen even more. So I just want us all to reflect on her top quality acting throughout this show (and the Frozen movies) from Chidis mind erasing to the scene where she returns the wallet to that guy.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

A year ago, I almost died. I was in an accident that doctors told me could easily have killed me, had things been slightly different (we're talking inches). At the time, I was just happy to be able to escape without any permanently life-altering injuries. I felt lucky. And then, gradually, as I had more time to process the events and listen to more doctors tell me how lucky I was, I began to realize the magnitude of what almost happened to me.

Now it goes without saying, but the experience completely forked me up. I was left with questions that no one had answers to, and surrounded by people who were incapable of understanding why I couldn't just let it go and move on. I tried, but I couldn't stop thinking about the fragility of life and how any moment could be our last, and how that's true for all of us but few of us truly live like it. It was the first time in my life that I didn't feel invincible.

During that time, I was a terrible person to be around. I was angry that no one could provide the answers that I wanted. I didn't understand why this had happened to me, or what it meant, or what I was supposed to do now. And then one day, when I was sitting on the couch drinking liberal amounts of alcohol (because that was just about the only thing I could do while I was recovering), a friend recommended that I watch a show called The Good Place. At first I was skeptical, but I soon fell in love with this unusual half-hour of American network television, this story about life and death and everything in between, and its message - that it doesn't matter if we're good people or bad people, what matters is that we're trying to be better.

I'm not sure if what happened to me was complete luck, or if I honestly was given a second chance at life. Regardless, it made me want to become a better, kinder person and to make the world a better place for those around me and those who will come after me.

The one year anniversary of my accident has been difficult for me to process. Looking back on this past year, I'm worried that I haven't done enough, that I've slipped back into taking my life for granted, that soon I'll turn back into the person I was before. And so I'd like to thank this show and this community for being such a joyful presence in my life and in the world, and for the reminder that what really matters is that we're all trying to be better than the people we were yesterday. Who knows who I'll be tomorrow?",19,1,False,self,,,,,

Here's what I came up with:

1. Most obviously, don't have Eleanor be one of the subjects, since she was almost always the one to figure things out. She's too wily and cynical and good at sniffing out a rat.
2. Similarly, having a Good Place Janet in the mix clearly didn't work. She can offer useful information and assistance to the humans, she can keep secrets from the demons, she can form genuine and wholesome relationships with them. A Bad Janet in disguise would've been far superior - if you recall, this was actually Michael's original plan, but pretending to be helpful made the Bad Janet melt. Apparently this is no longer the case so long as you reboot the Bad Janet enough times, so problem solved!
3. Building off of that last one, don't have Bad Janet serve as the not-a-robot butler, able to instantaneously fulfill any petty requests the humans have. E.g., there's no point torturing them with foods like chowder or Hawaiian pizza if they can order their favourite meal from Janet.
4. I honestly think he should've stuck with the change he made for Round 2, wherein he spread the subjects out instead of clustering them together, having them interact with demons in human disguises instead of each other. It's breaking the parameters of his original Sartre-esque concept to have the humans torture each other, but it also allows the demons a far greater level of control. Anyway, the plan to have the humans torture each other was also a failure even aside from Eleanor figuring things out - yeah, Michael had set things up so their situation was causing them stress, but they also consistently ended up bonding and becoming a team and becoming better people.
5. Don't let Chidi give everyone ethics lessons.

My immediate thought was that he is a continental philosopher as evident by three things:   
1. His opinion that everything is connected and is solvable with ""the answer"".  
2. His theories are an essential part of his own life and cannot be isolated from his experiences  
3. His writing is a huuuuuuge his 3,600-page manuscript instead alone essays (which also fits point 1)

I kinda fell aground on season 4 though, and decided to take break and see how things go. The big thing I wasn't feeling was the show's focus on relationship drama (mostly Eleanor/Chidi and Jason/Janet) instead weird existential shit. I also felt like the show looked like it was lingering on one premise: repeating the experiment from season 1  rather than exploring or revealing dramatically new scenarios every episode.

I'm not saying the episodes were bad, I'm saying I personally wasn't feeling it. That said, how has it progressed from there? Does season 4 stay more focused on relationship drama? Does it stay in the bounds of the same scenario (repeat the experiment) or are there major turning points and reveals episode-to-episode?

I've tried to collect each appearance and to translate it, [here](https://imgur.com/a/YGC1EH9) are 3 almost complete alphabets that appear throughout the show. (Full credit for the third language and goes to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/ajzuuz/s3e13_okay_i_cracked_one_of_the_shows_secret/))  


[Season 2 episode 9- ""Best Self""](https://imgur.com/ekvO4Km)  
Janet pulls out the instruction screen for the hot air balloon there's a paragraph about ""Lorem Ipsum"", I'll refer to this language as the first, and it's appearing here mirrored. Lorem Ipsum is a placeholder text, gibberish, but appearing real, in order for the reader to focus on the graphics instead of the text itself. It's been used since the early days of print and it's origin comes from a work by Cicero that got mangled up.  
(The paragraph is copied exactly from the [first result](https://www.lipsum.com/) when you google Lorem Ipsum)  


[Season 3 episode 1- ""Everything is Bonzer""](https://imgur.com/a/IJDZQCV)  
1. Michael is handing the doorman his papers, there's a close up of a number of languages, and again ""Lorem Ipsum"" appears in the first language.  
2. Shawn watches the stressed demon (Guillermo from What We Do in the Shadows!) searching for the humans, there's a brief close up of his computer showing a second language. It shows part of the original text in Latin that ""Lorem Ipsum"" is based on.  


[Season 3 episode 9- ""Janets"" (pt. 1)](https://imgur.com/a/icD8nEy)  
This episode is full of easter eggs so I divided it up to two parts  
1. When Michael and Janet wait for the Neil the accountant they see a wanted poster for the four humans. Below their pictures are the names of their actors, in a third language (with some added compliments). To the right there's some text in languages 2 and 3 that without further context I can't really figure out what it's about (right below Matt's request for immediate suicide)  
To the left there's a memorandum in languages 1 and 2 about the hazards of leaving the coffee pot on all day.  


[Season 3 episode 9- ""Janets"" (pt. 2)](https://imgur.com/a/dImX5dr)  
2. Neil pulls up Doug Forcett's file there are some letters from languages 2 and 3, nothing here but it's a clear view of some of the letters (and the props and cg departments deserve their effort to be seen)  
3. Jason and Tahani find Janet's ""Search Screen"" Jason asks for cartoons, and the screen fills with cartoons listed alphabetically (Alf is a cartoon, apparently) written in the second language. On the sides it says ""Janet"" and ""Cartoons"" in the third language.  
4. Jason stands below the tube going to the good place, there's a circle showing the four winds labeled ""N E S W"" in the third language.  
5. A brief close up of the buttons activating the tubes going to the bad and good place, there's a sign that says ""this dumb sign thanks"" (upside down, prop flop I guess)  


[Season 3 episode 10- ""The Book of Dougs""](https://imgur.com/a/uxweOoq)  
Michael pulls up random files from the book of Dougs, some gibberish in the second language. Nothing here but wanted to add it anyway.  


[A day in the Life on Set (Digital Extra)](https://imgur.com/a/e34ZaBy)  
A behind the scenes [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSV8rFuyE2Q) that seems to be taken between episode 10 and 11.   
1. Kristen and D'arcy show a warning sign not used on the show, with some warnings about the door to the I.H.O.P in the first language, and above it ""A B and C"" labels in the second language.  
2. Some signs in the first language on the door, made up creatures from the warnings mentioned above.  


[The Selection (Digital Mini-Series)](https://imgur.com/a/K0Uwvsp)  
(Even though this mini series was considered a season 4 prequel, it happens prior to the events in season 3's finale ""Pandemonium"", so I added it here)  
The demons are planning on ordering food, one of them holds a menu written in the second and third language (Exactly the menu from JJ's Diner in Parks and Recreation!)  


[Season 3 episode 12- ""Pandemonium""](https://imgur.com/a/FSamDOe)  
Eleanor opens John's file, there are some bad actions he took during his life, written in the third language. When she flips the page over, there is a file referring to her as some sort of personality test (there are some typos so it's unclear why it's attached to John's)  


[Season 4 episode 4- ""Tinker Taylor Demon Spy""](https://imgur.com/a/Gm688LZ)  
Michael and Jason are on the cart heading to the bad place with Glenn as blue goo in a barrel (third language, and a sign in english so no need to translate anything)  


[Season 4 episode 5- ""Employee of the Bearimy""](https://imgur.com/a/v2Cphmq)  
Vicki is trying to torture Janet as Shawn watches, near him there are signs aimed for the prisoners, written in the first and second languages, encouraging them to act annoying and disgustingly (there's an english version of the sign behind Shawn but there's some slight variations between them)  


[Season 4 episode 8- ""The Funeral to End All Funerals""](https://imgur.com/a/2dDdjfG)  
Matt pulls up the files for Kamilah, Donna, Patricia and Pillboi, their names are written in the first language, and besides each name there's their first initial in the second language.

I think that they probably will rejudge them, probably by wiping their memories and placing them in lots of testing places. After all, it would be unfair to ignore the already dead. 

That means, therefore, that the Good Place itself could massively expand. And at some point, some philosophers would probable end up there. They might not want to change, but Chidi did, so who knows?

There wont be any new episodes for the next few weeks, so maybe nows a good time to take the temperature of the sub.

You can offer up any suggestion you like in this thread, and if it gets support, well try to implement it. But in particular, wed like your feedback on these two issues:

___

#Reposts

For as long as I can remember, certain memes have always, *always* been reposted to this sub. Im talking the trolley kid, existential Michael, Janet with Eleanors file. Its become part of the culture of the sub, but its also been a source of grief.

If youre seeing the repost for the first time, then its new to you and its great. But for the regulars, its the same old shirt again.

We get lots of reports on reposts. But we dont act on them because theres no rule against it. Should there be?

What about low-effort posts in general? Weve gotten a couple ModMails asking us to be more strict, at least while the show is still airing. After the finale, we could loosen up again. What do you think about that?

&gt;PSA: Remember you can always click shirtless Chidi in the sidebar to filter out all the shirtposts. (The shirtless filter is available on [Classic Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/thegoodplace) only, though. There isnt an easy way to filter them out in mobile, or in your feed.)

In the same vein, do you want us to take down FAQ that are covered in the Welcome sticky at the top of the sub? Im talking about Chidis French, Mindy being the best person ever, the fate of Doug Forcett, etc. Should we take down these questions and direct people to read the sticky?

Or would that be too mean for new people just coming into the show?

Thats the big concern, I think. The sub should be friendly and welcoming to new people but at the same time not torture regulars with tons of reposts. So what do yall think? Should there be a rule or should we keep the status quo? **Please mention whether youre in favor of a No Reposts rule for memes, for FAQs, or for both.**

Also please comment on whether we should step up enforcement on low-effort posts, or keep it as is.

___

#Politics

Heres another touchy subject. Not to state the obvious, but this is a subreddit for a whimsical NBC sitcom. There are many other places on Reddit better suited to debate politics.

However, the show does occasionally reference US politics, sometimes obliquely, sometimes explicitly. (What kind of messed-up place would turn away refugees?) And the cast is also politically active. (Jameelas social media campaigns, Ted and Mannys climate change protests)

Still, Id wager &gt;90% of the slapfights on the sub arise out of political discussions. Civil discussion is great, but for whatever reason, political discussions on Reddit seldom remain civil.

My view is that if it directly pertains to the show, then its totally relevant and fair game for discussion. The cast stuff I think is a bit more grey since its not technically about the show but the actors. On the other hand we do allow posts about their other films and projects and whateverso maybe politics should be considered just another one of their interests?

Practically speaking, allowing politics for show and cast would be more subjective, require more judgment calls, than allowing it for show only. No politics at all would be the easiest to enforce consistently.

The one thing we have consensus on is that if a political discussion has *nothing to do with the show or cast* then it doesnt belong here. And of course once *any* discussion turns uncivil, we enforce Reddiquette which means removals and/or locks if it gets out of hand. But as for the rest, we want to know your opinion. What do you think?

Should we have a No Politics rule? And should there be exceptions to it for the show or cast, or just an all-out ban? **Please mention whether youre in favor of a No Politics AT ALL rule, Politics just for the Show, or Politics for the Show and Cast.**

___

If you could answer the Reposts and Politics questions in **separate comments** that might make it easier to keep track.

This thread will stay up for a month, so everyone has a chance to weigh in. Well announce the rule changesif anyin the week before the next episode. Thanks for your input. :)

___

**TL;DR:** Answer in separate Q1 / Q2 comments.

* **Q1:** No reposts, period. No meme reposts, leave the FAQs. No FAQ reposts, leave the memes. Step up low-effort enforcement, yes or no?

* **Q2:** No politics, period. Politics for show only. Politics for show and cast activism.",43,1,False,self,,,,,

I think it's fair...

If an action is immediately good: +1

If an action is immediately bad: -1

Any neutral action that is neither immediately good or bad: 0

Any action that results in long term good or bad: 0
(Because humans can't predict the future nor can they be responsible for something beyond their immediate control/interaction)

If an action is done with altruistic motivation: +1
If an action is done for selfish/antagonistic reasons: -1
If an action has no distinctive motivation: 0

Examples:

*1) Planting a tree gets +1 point for immediate good. If the tree is planted for altruistic reasons (want a place for birds to nest), then +1 point is added for a total gain of +2 points. However, if the tree is planted for selfish reasons (to impress someone, hide the body of a cat you hit with your car....) then you lose -1 point so even though planting the tree was good, bad motivation knocks it back to 0. If the motivation was neutral (the tree is part of a new landscape design) then you get 0 points for motivation but still net +1 point for doing something good.

*2) Buying an apple is a neutral action that generates 0 points. If you buy the apple from a homeless person because you know they need the money to survive you get +1 point. However, if you buy an apple to throw at someone, you get -1 point. If your motivation is neutral (you're hungry) you don't receive any more points but you also don't lose points so the act nets 0 points.

*3) The Trolly Problem: It doesn't matter whether you switch the tracks or not. Either scenario results in one or more saved life, which is good, so +1 point no matter what you do. If you are altruistic in your decision (making an effort to do good no matter what you decide), then you receive an additional +1 point. However, if your decision is not altruistic (you switch the track to kill someone you don't like) then you lose -1 point netting 0 points. If your motivation is neutral (you flip a coin) then you don't gain anymore points but still net +1 point for saving one or more lives.

*4) Murder is bad, so killing someone is -1 point. However if you kill someone to save someone else who is being attacked, then you gain +1 point which cancels the two out, netting 0 points. However if you kill someone out of anger or malice, that's -1 point for a total of -2 points. If you kill someone by accident, the action had no distinctive motivation so you don't lose any additional points and it stands at -1 point.

*5) Stealing is bad, so -1 point for theft. But if your motivation is altruistic (steal a loaf of bread to feed a unhungry child) then you gain +1 point netting 0 points total. However if you steal out of greed, you lose -1 point for total loss of -2 points. 

A LOT of things humans do are neither good or bad so most things would be considered neutral, gaining 0 points. However some of these neutral things can gain or lose a point depending on your motivation. Peeing is a bodily function so it doesn't generate or lose any points. However, if someone pees on their neighbor's lawn just to be a dick, they lose -1 point. Peeing on someone's foot who just got stung by a sea urchin would gain you +1 point.

I've tried to collect each appearance and to translate it, [here](https://imgur.com/a/YGC1EH9) are 3 almost complete alphabets that appear throughout the show. (Full credit for the third language goes to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/ajzuuz/s3e13_okay_i_cracked_one_of_the_shows_secret/))

[Season 2 episode 9- ""Best Self""](https://imgur.com/ekvO4Km)Janet pulls out the instruction screen for the hot air balloon there's a paragraph about ""Lorem Ipsum"", I'll refer to this language as the first, and it's appearing here mirrored. Lorem Ipsum is a placeholder text, gibberish, but appearing real, in order for the reader to focus on the graphics instead of the text itself. It's been used since the early days of print and it's origin comes from a work by Cicero that got mangled up.(The paragraph is copied exactly from the [first result](https://www.lipsum.com/) when you google Lorem Ipsum)

[Season 3 episode 1- ""Everything is Bonzer""](https://imgur.com/a/IJDZQCV)

1. Michael is handing the doorman his papers, there's a close up of a number of languages, and again ""Lorem Ipsum"" appears in the first language.
2. Shawn watches the stressed demon (Guillermo from What We Do in the Shadows!) searching for the humans, there's a brief close up of his computer showing a second language. It shows part of the original text in Latin that ""Lorem Ipsum"" is based on.

[Season 3 episode 9- ""Janets"" (pt. 1)](https://imgur.com/a/icD8nEy)This episode is full of easter eggs so I divided it up to two parts

1. When Michael and Janet wait for the Neil the accountant they see a wanted poster for the four humans. Below their pictures are the names of their actors, in a third language (with some added compliments). To the right there's some text in languages 2 and 3 that without further context I can't really figure out what it's about (right below Matt's request for immediate suicide)To the left there's a memorandum in languages 1 and 2 about the hazards of leaving the coffee pot on all day.

[Season 3 episode 9- ""Janets"" (pt. 2)](https://imgur.com/a/dImX5dr)2. Neil pulls up Doug Forcett's file there are some letters from languages 2 and 3, nothing here but it's a clear view of some of the letters (and the props and cg departments deserve their effort to be seen)3. Jason and Tahani find Janet's ""Search Screen"" Jason asks for cartoons, and the screen fills with cartoons listed alphabetically (Alf is a cartoon, apparently) written in the second language. On the sides it says ""Janet"" and ""Cartoons"" in the third language.4. Jason stands below the tube going to the good place, there's a circle showing the four winds labeled ""N E S W"" in the third language.5. A brief close up of the buttons activating the tubes going to the bad and good place, there's a sign that says ""this dumb sign thanks"" (upside down, prop flop I guess)

[Season 3 episode 10- ""The Book of Dougs""](https://imgur.com/a/uxweOoq)Michael pulls up random files from the book of Dougs, some gibberish in the second language. Nothing here but wanted to add it anyway.

[A day in the Life on Set (Digital Extra)](https://imgur.com/a/e34ZaBy)A behind the scenes [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSV8rFuyE2Q) that seems to be taken between episode 10 and 11.

1. Kristen and D'arcy show a warning sign not used on the show, with some warnings about the door to the I.H.O.P in the first language, and above it ""A B and C"" labels in the second language.
2. Some signs in the first language on the door, made up creatures from the warnings mentioned above.

[The Selection (Digital Mini-Series)](https://imgur.com/a/K0Uwvsp)(Even though this mini series was considered a season 4 prequel, it happens prior to the events in season 3's finale ""Pandemonium"", so I added it here)The demons are planning on ordering food, one of them holds a menu written in the second and third language (Same menu from JJ's Diner in Parks and Recreation!)

[Season 3 episode 12- ""Pandemonium""](https://imgur.com/a/FSamDOe)Eleanor opens John's file, there are some bad actions he took during his life, written in the third language. When she flips the page over, there is a file referring to her, seems to be some sort of personality test (there are some typos so it's unclear why it's attached to John's)

[Season 4 episode 4- ""Tinker Taylor Demon Spy""](https://imgur.com/a/Gm688LZ)Michael and Jason are on the cart heading towards the bad place with Glenn as blue goo in a barrel (third language, and a sign in english so no need to translate anything)

[Season 4 episode 5- ""Employee of the Bearimy""](https://imgur.com/a/v2Cphmq)Vicki is trying to torture Janet as Shawn watches, near him there are signs aimed for the prisoners, written in the first and second languages, encouraging them to act annoying and disgustingly (there's an english version of the sign behind Shawn but there's some slight variations between them)

[Season 4 episode 8- ""The Funeral to End All Funerals""](https://imgur.com/a/2dDdjfG)Matt pulls up the files for Kamilah, Donna, Patricia and Pillboi, their names are written in the first language, and besides each name there's their first initial in the second language.

Obviously, this isn't what the humans want. But it did make me wonder:

The Soul Squad was very clear about what they wanted to come out of this experiment; *tweaking* the system used to judge humans instead of, y'know, *genocide*. How could the Judge make this ruling if she knew what the Soul Squad wanted to come out of it?

My theory is that Judge Gen isn't Judge Gen at all, but actually a demon wearing a Judge suit. Here's why:

Her excuse is that ""Earth is too much of a mess."" But, how could something be too complicated for the Judge of the Universe? This is the same being that experienced lives in numerous different countries on Earth in a matter of five seconds. And the same being that absorbed Eleanor, Chidi, Jason and Tahani's *entire existences* in less than a second. The Judge isn't this stupid.

Also, she points out how she thinks humans might evolve better than they did the first time. ""Maybe this time they won't have baby teeth, y'know? That whole thing is so weird, how they fall out and then the bigger teeth just grow into that same hole. Gross."" We've seen Bad Place demons repeatedly express their disgust and discontent with human bodies; Michael does this quite a bit in the beginning episodes of Season 2. 

Another point: Shawn clearly expresses how pleased he is with this outcome, telling Michael, ""Even when you succeed, you still fail."" The Judge seems apathetic towards how overwhelmingly her ruling seems to favor the Bad Place and not the Soul Squad. She's supposed to remain neutral and impartial; unbiased. 

Plus, why would she extinguish humans when she seems to enjoy a lot of the things that they've made? She does nothing but rewatch TV show after TV show in her chambers, and she even gave Michael a petition to reboot Ally McBeal just before the trial started. 

She also seemed extremely furious and frustrated with all the Janets; we know that she can be mad, but she just seemed *so overwhelmingly mad* at her ruling being overturned. Again, this isn't very out of character, but...still.

However, I *do* think that real Judge does appear in this episode. I think that in between the scenes in which she says, ""I'll have my ruling shortly,"" and the scene where she actually gives her ruling, the Bad Place might've had the chance to somehow switch the Judge with a demon in the Judge suit. As for who the demon is, it might be Vicky? We know she was turned into goo, but it has been said that demons come back from their goo form eventually. However, Vicky just seems the most likely to *pretend* to be someone else given her obsession with acting and her bad acting skills.

However, there is one flaw in this theory that does kind of fork with me: when the Judge entered Janet's void to get the Earth rebooter thingy back, Janet started acting like there was something crawling up and around her under her clothes. I don't exactly know how to describe what she did. This would suggest that this happens to her whenever demons enter her void, but Michael has entered her void and she didn't act like that (but! It might be because Michael isn't evil anymore. Maybe evil things in her void bother her?). 

So, yeah. That's my theory. The Bad Place switched out Judge Gen with a demon. :)",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I finished season two about a week ago and I started season 3 today and finished it and it was probably the best season in terms of story. Some of my favorite things were 


&gt;donkey doug being Jasons dad, and their little moment at the end of their episode 

&gt;Eleanor getting closure with her mom and tahani getting closure with khamila. Both were really sweet moments 

&gt;every single moment with chidi in the episode with jeremy bearimy. That episode is an absolute goldmine for chidi quotes and memes(put the peeps in the chili pot)

&gt;janet this entire season. Darcy carden deserves an award for the janets episode alone 

&gt;the world building by finally meeting doug and learning about how broken the point system is. That was so excellent and interesting

Two weeks later Im all caught up. I love it! I still have some questions though. 

SPOILERS FOR EVERY EPISODE SO FAR!!!






Im not taking these questions too seriously because its a comedy and these dont affect my enjoyment but just for fun:


- How is Mindy St. Claire the only person to ever get into the Medium Place? Out of 100 billion or so? 


- Also this means shes the only person to get even close to the Good Place in over 500 years, but how can that be? What about little children that die before they can do much of anything, or infants that die hours after birth?


- How is Doug Forcett not going to the Good Place? Michael showed that the main problem with the point system is the negative unforeseen consequences for each action, most of which are related to the environment and the global society. But he tried his best to live off the grid and grew all his own food, etc. so his carbon footprint and effect on the environment should be very low.


- In season 1, since it was actually the Bad Place, how come they still couldnt curse? I suppose Michael wanted to make it authentic as possible but the 4 humans wouldnt have known the difference.


- That weird black and pink prism thing that the accountant was in during the simulated neighborhood in season 4, I think I remember seeing that before in that episode that showed a montage of Michaels 802 reboot attempts. Does anyone else remember that and have an idea of what it might have been there for?


- Finally, for a show called The Good Place, how insane is it that we still have never once seen the actual Good Place? That post office doesnt count. 0/10 (Just kidding on this last one. Im guessing well see it in the finale)",21,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
