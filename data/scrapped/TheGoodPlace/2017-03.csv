[Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/5x1jux/what_was_micheals_plan_spoilers/,rain_parkour,1488433988,"So the end of the season was building up to the moral choice that they would have to choose who was going to the bad place, but then Eleanor figured it out. But what was Micheal going to do if they didn't figure it out? Two of them, probably Jason and Eleanor, would be sent to the 'bad place' and then the others would just live in the good place? The group would be separated so there isn't the torturing of each other as Micheal wants. Plus two of them would just be suffering in fire and brimstone. It seems like Eleanor's realization is a large ex machina to get the show out of what would happen.

Unrelated: in hindsight, if everyone else is actors and in on it, what was with Micheal kicking that dog in that early episode?",10,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

After watching the finale, it brings up a lot of questions because of the reasons given for Chidi and Tahani being sent to the bad good place. Tahani is a bad person who does good things, while Chidi is a good person who does bad things, yet both are labeled as bad. Considering the point system given by the angels, it is likely that this universe accepts some form of ethical altruism. However, why is it that in one case the intention is the decider of a good person, where in the other, intention is completely disregarded in favor if the end result. Could there be an ethical system in which intentions and results are both taken into account? If so, how is one weighed against the other? It seems like the writers set up this contradiction on purpose considering every episode is riddled with ethical dilemmas.",10,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

I only have an undergraduate degree in philosophy, so obviously I'm not an expert. But I do know a thing or two about how moral philosophy is supposed to run, and Chidi blatantly does a terrible job, both as a teacher and as an academic.

* The first book Eleanor reads for his class is *On the Way to Language* by Heidegger.  Heidegger is a notoriously horrendous author to read, especially for beginners, and this book is only tangentially related to practical ethics.  Right off the bat, not a good look for him.

* Then, Chidi just accepts at face value that Michael's bosses have figured out ethics.  He doesn't ask for any sort of rational justification, which is supposed to be the bedrock of philosophy.

* Even after he accepted that The Good Place has it all figured out, for some reason Chidi also teaches Utilitarianism as a valid theory.  In the very first episode you find that you get points for things like ""being a lifelong fan of the Cleveland Browns"".  Given that, and the fact that if Utilitarianism is true then only total happiness matters, then Chidi should have immediately concluded that Utilitarianism is false.  That's basic logic.

While watching the series, I sort of just played this off as the writers having never taken anything other than Intro to Phil, but then the ending happened and I had to think again.  Was this supposed to be a clue for people who knew a bit about the subject?  Chidi was supposedly in ""The Good Place"" because he devoted his entire life to the study of ethics.  But his actions in the show lead us to believe that he was really really bad at it.  I really hope it was intentional because that would just be amazing.",3,47,False,spoiler,,,,,
