At first we all thought that because of the glitch that brought her there, Eleanor's bad actions were corrupting the perfect neighborhood.

But knowing the final twist, either Michael was generating disasters deliberately based on her actions, or he some how created a link between her and the fabric of the neighborhood.

One noteworthy piece of information is that no harm seems to have arisen from Jason, which has two possible explanations that I can see. Either he, being silent and spending his time in his own budhole, managed to affect nothing, or Michael was not dealing with him in the same way at all.

Which makes more sense? And if Michael left Jason out of that side of his plan, why?",3,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

(Also, just note that I've only finished watching season 1 a few hours ago and have only begun reading subreddits. I've also haven't watched Schur's interviews re: this show.)


I've been on subreddits for a while now and I see lots of theories on how Eleanor, Chidi, Jayson, and Tahani got sent to the bad place. Questioning their morality and such. And how they could reach salvation through good deeds and be sent to the Good Place.

I think most people, after watching the season one finale, have forgotten the premise that the religions were only 5% correct. Michael could well be lying about that, but I doubt it. Anyway, here are my thoughts:

Mindy is not a minion of Michael. The Medium Place is real.
Someone from another thread pointed out that Mindy died 30 years ago, and Michael only began the construction of Fake!Good Place recently. The video they watched on TV was a message from two representatives, Adam Scott and that other one who I don't think we've seen anywhere in the Fake!Good Place. (Check out: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/5p0kec/episode_discussion_s01_e13_michaels_gambit/dcnz28p/)

Michael has implied before that there are dimensions humans simply cannot see/fathom. Although there is the Good Place, and there is the Bad Place. That doesn't mean those are the only places to exist in the Afterlife. Here's my theory.

Humans (normally) experience two simple dimensions/destinations: Life and the Afterlife. When people die, they transfer unto the next dimension, the Afterlife. Now, in all the dimensions, there are two powerful factions. The ""Good"" and the ""Bad"". So when people die, they don't automatically get sent to The Good Place or The Bad Place, those factions just.. get dibs on them.

I'm not sure if the point system is real, but I think they are some sort of basis for higher beings to judge a person. But that does not decide what's right or wrong. Because right and wrong, and even the truth, are subjective. Even if you say that there are opinions, and then there are hard facts... This is the truth of the universe we are talking about. People/beings cannot decide what ultimately is the truth. But I don't want to get into that debate.. 

I'm just saying that, the point system was used by Michael to further torture the four of them.

So, don't be fooled. This is very much inspired/influenced by Christianity/Catholicism. But keep an open mind to fully enjoy the show.

But what do you think?
