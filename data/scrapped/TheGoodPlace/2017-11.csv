1. Janet knows everything there is to know in the universe, yet a reset causes to forget what happened personally to it.    
2. Studying ethics doesn't make sense given that only good actions made with good intent have any non-negative value. This time would be best spent studying list of point values for every action, as we have seen fairly innocuous actions are considered automatically negative, i.e. being from Florida, liking EDM.        
3. As an academic, Chidi doesn't make sense. Academia is usually focused on rigorous research. Chidi seems like a ethics/philosophy teachers, and not interested in meaningful research at all. Imagine as a scientist you die, and have access to literally every piece of knowledge in the universe. Wouldn't you ask some questions? Which philospher was wrong? Which on was right? What is the solution to the train problem?     
4. Given an all knowing Janet, the entire crew is a set of idiots. They seem complicit it not knowing how to get to the real good place.         
5. Chidi says that Michael is unable to understand human ethics because as an immortal he isn't concerned with consequences. All things are forgivable given an infinite time horizon. But those things can now be applied to Eleanor, Chidi, Jason and Tahani. They are immortal spirits without any known way of being destroyed, why can't they adopt the same mentality show by Michael or any other immortal? Now they too have an infinite time horizon to act as they please.     
6. I don't know how you can have every atom of your being on the surface of a different star and still have testicles round with rope. 
7. If all religion is wrong, why haven't any of the crew asked any religious or meaning of it all type questions?     
8. Completely erasing memories seems like a complete waste given that selective memory wipe is possible. Each of the four had the memories of their death erased from the memories until Michael allowed them to remember them. Why reset at all? If Eleanor figures it out, reset the clock back one day, and continue.

Proving that you can change and grow while in The Bad Place and become a better person?

Where they are now their torture stems from each other (to a smaller degree) and their happiness also stems from each other. For all we know The Good Place isn't that great either because everyone is so happy and perfect with each other that it Eleanor is turned off, Chidi finds it unrealistic ethically, Tahani will probably find the overwhelming amount of white displeasing and Jason...

But think about it. Is it even possible to create a Good Place? Given enough time and even the best people will go nuts if closed in a small neighborhood.

I think that season 3 will be build around an idea, that our 4 humans and one demon will be heavily disappointed by the real Good Place. People there won't be that good. Even if they got to real GP because of their actions on Earth, they stopped caring in afterlife.
We will see bored people, that abuse Janet to do their wicked wished and a GP will be a very filthy place.

Tahani could met her sister and parents. Eleonor will get annoyed by the fact, that people worse than her got to real GP. Chidi will be stressed as always, and Jason will be torn between new, disgusting Good Place and loyalty to Tahani and others.

Michael could become creative and he could start designing clever tortures for those filthy inhabitants of a Good Place.

And of course our evolved Janet could have fun moments while interacting with much earlier copy.

There's a lot to work with.

It all could even end with our gang returning to Bad Place, because it was well organized. Maybe they could build a better ""Bad Place"" in season 4, because real good place was such a disappointment. It could all led to creating a purgatory, when mildly bad people are given a chance to improve themselves.

What if The Bad Place is located in The Good Place? What if afterlife = The Good Place, but within the Good Place, there's one section called 'The Bad Place', set up with the purpose of trying to help morally neutral/bad people to become morally good. I mean, that's what people in The Good Place would want, right?
For instance, in S1E13, when 'Real Eleanor' offered to take up one of the slots and go to 'The Bad Place', that got me thinking- if there is really The Good Place, then wouldn't the Good people try to do something about it? Like, why would they put up with The Bad Place? Theyve literally spent their time on earth being morally good and Im sure they would want to help the bad people to try to be morally good because, well, that is the moral thing to do. (I know that Real Eleanor ended up being a fake, but that point led me to think about the Real Good people in the Real Good place)

Now, what about Michael then? Is he an angel disguised as a demon? Not sure, but for now, it's probably a nope. I think he really is a demon. Along with the other demon characters, such as the big one in the conference, whereby he didn't even bother hiding his large fiery demon form, or even Bad Janet. They are all morally bad. But what if it's STILL a part of The Good Place plan? What if all these were allowed by TGP to make TBP feel like they have some control and power that TGP does not have? It makes it more realistic.

Then, what about The Middle Place? TGP was fighting with TBP over Mindy, but eventually, came up with TMP - warm beer, live versions of Eagle - perhaps this was again, a plan of TGP: to let TBP feel that they had some sort of power. 

Now, TBP has been torturing people for centuries or longer. When Michael comes up with this psychological form of torture, Shawn gives him a chance. Perhaps, Shawn is part of TGP, who wants to see if Michael would somehow, through this experience, become morally good? He/TGP lets Michael steal Good Janet easily, because this might help them in becoming morally good. We can see this when Michael does not want to kill Good Janet, even though that appeared to be the easiest way, because he was emotionally invested in her and treated her like a friend. 

What about Vicky? She seems to be unhappy with her small role in S2, and took over from Michael. Vicky is either sent from TGP to try and help Michael (because his countless of reboots aren't working), or she is genuinely annoyed and wants to torture the humans. Either way, I feel that Michael does not know about Vicky's real intentions - at the end 'Derek', we see Shawn at Michael's desk. Perhaps, Shawn wants to test if Michael has become a little morally better - would he sacrifice his friends (Eleanor, Chidi, etc) in order to be saved? Afterall, Shawn told Michael quite confidently that his plan would fail and there would be no third attempt. 

Some flaws to this theory would be that 
1) TGP allowed TBP to do physical torture for thousands of years without doing anything?
2) Perhaps the people in TGP cannot do anything - as seen in TMP - which makes us wonder, who is behind both TGP, TBP, and TMP in the first place (no pun intended)?
3) It seems like TMP is protected from TBP. So maybe there really is TMP?
4) Seems like TGP really had nothing better to do or no better plan than this. 

I also lean quite strongly to another theory whereby Vicky and Michael are in cahoots and is still torturing the humans as planned, but idk, this feels like a cheat. 


tldr; The Good Place is behind all of these shit so that everyone can eventually be good

Translated, it means ""God exists"", where ""chi"" means ""god"" and ""di"" can mean ""is"", referring to a place or location. Chidi is often the shortened version of the name Chidiebere, which means ""God is merciful"". 

The way you pronounce it is /Chi-deh-be-leh/, where the ""r"" is pronounced sort of like an ""L"". 

With regards to his last name, I'm not too sure. Igbo is my second language and my knowledge is from hearing it being spoken to me and not written. I don't really get to use it that often seeing as I live in the U.S. 

When I say ""Anagonye"" out loud, I am led to believe that it means ""we are going"" or ""I am leaving"". When you put it in google translate however, you get ""anguish"" and depending on how you space the letters in the word you get a different result. I will ask someone more knowledgeable than I am about the meaning of his last name and get back to you in a little while.

EDIT: so I asked some relatives and they don't know what Anagonye means even though it is an Igbo last name. It could be that Anagonye is in another dialect within the Igbo language that we don't know about, or that my relatives have never encountered an Anagonye. ",21,101,False,self,,,,,

For some reason IMDB only has info about three of these episodes, and even more strangely the episodes are 10-12 (the opener and finale are omitted).  Here's the tiny bit of info I managed to glean:

Episode 2-10 (""Best Self"") features Val (Michael's architect co-worker who warns him not to ""rock the boat,"" and likes pouring spiders into people's eyes), and a new character named ""Chork.""

Episode 2-11 (""Rhonda, Diana, Jake, and Trent"") features Tahani's parents.  

Episode 2-12 (""The Burrito"") seems like an episode with a bunch of Eleanor flashbacks.  It has cameos from her old boss (Wallace, played by Seth Morris), Madison (The Dress Bitch!), and her other roommate who was featured in the Dress Bitch flashback (Brittany).  But, there's also a new character listed only as ""Strange Man""(?)

In particular, I believe that there is more to the story than we have been told about how Michael acquired Janet.  We're told that the Janet room was unlocked, and he walked out with one.  When we see him stealing Janet, all of the shots are pretty close in on them and we don't get anything like a fun massive overview of 100s or 1000s of D'Arcy Cardens.  This makes me think the Janet heist did not go as smoothly as he told Sean and the rest of the Bad Place design staff.  I think we could be seeing either a new character of someone in the real Good Place who was involved, or else something like a ""Most Wanted"" poster with Michael's face on it for stealing a good place Janet, which may cause _issues_ if/when the gang tries to make a move towards the real bad place.

My other reasoning here is that Michael is very reluctant to marble Janet.  Maybe it's just affection, but I think not.  I think he doesn't want to destroy Janet because he _can't_ destroy Janet.  He can't get a new Janet because of whatever went wrong or allowed him to get his current Janet.  He can't tell her that cause she thinks he's a Good Place architect, and of course a real Good Place architect could just go down to the Janet warehouse.

Anyway, not sure exactly where they might be going with this, but I think we're in for more Janet origin story at the least.",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

We liked the characters, liked the premise, loved the twist at the end of the season and we were really excited and curious where they would go with it.


Season 2 has felt completely directionless and scrambled so far though. It feels like the creators don't really know what is going to happen and they're just winging it from episode to episode, much like the characters of the show. I'm having a really hard time staying interested. I came to this sub to see what the temperature was like here, but you all seem to be enjoying it and coming up with theories of what will happen next.... which is great but I'm just a bit surprised.

Are there others who are dissatisfied with Season 2 so far?

**EDIT**: OK great we've established that most of you disagree with my opinion. That's why I asked the question, I'm hoping someone can convince me otherwise because I WANT to like the show, but I don't anymore. You can't just tell me I'm wrong though you gotta give me some reasons. Reasons so far:

* Just because I don't understand the direction doesn't make it directionless.

&gt;a little insulting but you're right, it does have a direction and I just don't like it. They also took 3 episodes to establish any sort of direction, so it felt directionless for some time.


* Schur knows what he's doing cause Se03 was planned out during writing of Se02.

&gt; well I would sure hope so, but that doesn't mean that it's being done in a compelling way, which has ended up coming off to me as not really knowing what he's doing.


* The pace has been good for a sitcom

&gt;My memory is probably a bit off but: 3 episodes to establish Michael's new character, 2 episodes to show that he sucks at learning from Chidi, and 2 more episodes to randomly have Jason and Tahani fall in love so that Janet gets sad and the characters have something to do... that's a pretty slow and pointless pace if you ask me.

* It's a new premise and you're complaining about that? Ya basic

&gt; The new premise is that they're all kind of semi-working to be ""good people"" with the vague hope that maybe it will allow them to get into the real good place which might not exist. The way they're hoping to achieve this is by having Chidi, a person who was sent to the bad place with them, teach them how to be good people, including Michael who is literally a demon that works in the bad place. I say boo, that's boring and doesn't really make sense.

The most exciting thing that has happened this whole season was at the end of the last episode, and we'll see where that takes us because it could be an exciting way to pick up the pace and bring in new elements or it could just be another boring distraction.

**EDIT 2:** Ok you guys have done a good job of showing me where I was wrong. Season 2 has more clear direction than I gave it credit for, I just haven't been a huge fan of the new direction. I suppose my main issue is that the plot seems to be moving at a slower pace, but many of you disagree about that as well so I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree.

A lot of people have remarked that while Chidi &amp; Eleanor have chemistry, it's not really much of the romantic sort so this relationship may come off as a little forced, especially since it only comes about because of a recording on a tape. We also know that at least one of them isn't really as into it as they seemed to be in this cycle.

Here's something odd about the whole thing - the Medium place seems to be designed so nothing better than ""decent"" ever really happens. Any sort of highs would be few and far between. The idea of a relationship blossoming between two people like that, true love, and there being video evidence of it, seems incredibly momentous.

Unless it isn't - because while Chidi and Eleanor are more than capable of LIKING each other in a romantic sense to some degree, full on romantic love is maybe less of a thing. But - here's the thing - if there's any chemistry between them, which there is, it's something you could ""make do"" with. Just like you'd ""Make do"" with Cannonball Run II.
