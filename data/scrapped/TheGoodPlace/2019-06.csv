With that out the way, come in (and be quiet, Michael can hear you!). So starting for episode 1 we see Eleanor introduced to the good place which, as Michael states to be ""the next phase of your existence in the universe"". But going to be after watching that, it starts to bother me... Why'd he say ""next phase""... and not ""final phase""..? Is there something that comes after life AND the afterlife?
There's something else that bothers me to, when Eleanor and in turn, us is introduced to Chidi; he claims he's from Senegal. (Imagine, if you will Chidi saying ""Senegal"" multiple times in increasingly slow motion.) Now I haven't been to Senegal, but Chid's accent when using English seems.... strangely american. I'd expect him to have a stronger accent. Is Chidi even from Senegal? Is the good place translator filtering out Chidi's accent so Eleanor can understand him? Or is there something darker at play like there's someone on the inside trying to warn Elanor about Michel's gambit through subtle suggestion?
My third ""theory"" to use the term loosely is based on the nature of the good place. In an infinite universe with an un-determined number of planets, doesn't it seem a little weird that there is an afterlife would exist solely for humans? Surely other species, whether terrestrial, extra-terrestrial or even extra-solar can be able to do enough good or bad or order to be admitted to the good or bad place.

Back in May 2016, I went on one of the tram tours at Universal Studios. When we got to the what I think was called Little Italy, we had to stop since they were filming something. Our tour guide told us they couldnt tell us it what it was, but it would be premiering later that fall.

We waited for about ten minutes near a trailer thing, I think it was a bathroom. Several people went in and out and back to the set, one of them wearing a monk outfit and another woman, but none of them were people I recognized.

Later that night I went to go look up shows that were going to air in the fall, and I discovered The Good Place. It made even more sense because on the tour, we passed by a parking space labeled K. Bell who could only be Kristen Bell.

So knowing that I saw them filming the show led to me checking it out later that year. I also realized the two people I saw going to the bathroom were Jason and Tahani!

Its awesome to look back on it now, but I didnt take any pictures thinking I wasnt allowed to. So glad to have witnessed the making of such a fun show!",0,67,False,self,,,,,

My proposal would be to launch multiple experiments a la Season 4 but where Sean has drafted characters from other Mike Schur shows. The Good Place Characters have to teach them how to be better.  So, draft 1 from each show (B99, Office, Parks and Rec) and I guess round it out with a new fourth character.  Groups I would like to see:

Neighborhood 1
1.  Kevin (Office)
2.  Tom Haverford (Parks)
3.  Kevin (B99) - Bonus is MEJ plays the role which drives TGP characters nuts (Can see Ellinor saying you know who you look just like...)

Neighborhood 2
1.  Ron Swanson (Parks)
2.  Darrell (Office)
3.  Gina Linetti (B99)

Neighborhood 3
1.  Dwight Schrute (Office)
2.  Rosa Diaz (B99)
3.  April Ludgate (Parks)
They are kind of similar characters but they would drive each other nuts.

Neighborhood 4:
1.  Angela (Office)
2. Donna Meagle (Parks)
3.  Charles Boyle (B99)

* Since each season begins with an episode titled ""Everything is \_\_\_\_"" I think the perfect title for the series finale would be ""Everything is Good"" 
* I hope they don't get too wrapped up in the romance storylines. With Derek-Janet-Jason and especially Simone-Eleanor-Chidi, I hope they focus more on the characters and not the relationships (please no cheesy love triangle!)
* I think it should end with a 'snap' by Michael or the Judge (or God??) and the screen goes black right after that
* Looking forward to some more great restaurant name puns
* I actually don't want to see ""The Good Place"". I think it would be better left as a mystery. A good way to do this would be the opposite of the season one theme: Instead of learning that *""*Hell is Other People,"" they should find that ""Heaven is Other People,"" and that as long as they have each other, they don't need a good place

I assume that it is just a straight tent and 1 and 13 would be on the same level.

Sorry for the format, Im on mobile.

So, this is a theory of how it may actually end/what the final twist could be! Thinking broadly, and just watching a bunch of old episodes, and this thought occurred to me (apologize if others have written this before...):

What if the reason The Good Place seems oddly behind the times, no one was watching the Janet warehouse, the council is so bogged down in slowness/politics/slow thinking is because for whatever reason, there ARE NO EMPLOYEES LEFT in The Good Place.  No one has  gotten in because, for whatever reason, there is a skeleton crew running the entire good place...and, because of this? They needed to start recruiting Good Place managers/bosses. Theyve always been in the Good Place, but they needed to pass a blind recruitment test. So a plan WAS created, but not what we (and the 4) have been led to believe was the plan.... 

Because, then, in order for them to be approved to be the Good Place architects and management, they needed to make sure that they had the absolute perfect souls to handle not only the Good Places old backlog of souls, but also the new souls. They needed four people/souls like this - a new kind of architect maybe - these 4 souls that would understand with much more clarity how to design neighborhoods and make the good place calls for who gets in that is dying now on this current Earth. The only way to do that? The only way to make sure these 4 are the right people, because this may be the first time souls that lived on Earth are ever asked to be architects... would be to make them design THEIR version of the Good Place while being blind to the truth. They would then (I assume this will happen in the next season) have a final test which is: can these souls see through the fact that they once knew these new recruits picked as the worst for them (the 4) and still make the correct decision as to whether the souls belong in the Good or Bad Place.

This would mean that Janet and Michael are really angels, or Michael is, and theyve always been in the Good Place. They (the judge, Michael, Janet, etc) already know the final test is the souls brought in which the main 4 think are there because they are the best to torture our heroes.... are already souls that belong in the Good Place. If they complete these tests correctly. The series ends with these four heroes being the new leaders and runners and architects of The Good Place and they get to run it for eternity w Michael, etc. Happy and twisted ending! 

The secondary version of my theory here is that the 4 could all have always worked for the Good Place, but agreed to have their memories erased - LIKE CHIDI DID IN THE S3 FINALE - because they knew (Like Chidi did sort of) that the only way to be unbiased from DAY ONE was to erase their memories... 

This could explain a lot (Janet always evolving when maybe its just she needs excuses because she, in our hero 4s eyes, has to have reasons to explain her emotions, etc, why Eleanor kept figuring it out over and over - and Jason even once - its her angel or good soul pushing through, and why the Good Place seems so behind in the times, etc)

I know there are potentially holes you brilliant people here will find, but this theory seems plausible and I would love to hear what you all think if you agree - what other puzzle piece or pieces could fit here to prove this is a viable theory as to how it may end? I could be 100% wrong, I also am thinking of ten other things this would explain, but I wont make this insanely long because most here already know what I mean.  Something tells me this would be a possible direction, at least, for the series to go and ultimately end with.... or, its the same, but VERY dark, and the Bad Place and Michael really just wanted the people going to the bad place to design or walk right into designing the BEST own personal hell for themselves in the Bad Place.

Part of the reason I have this feeling is I SWEAR I read something about a six season plan after the first season had aired. Part of the reason I believe it is denial.

We have made it through season 2 and I began contemplating the direction the show is trying to go and the overall message they may be trying to send/convey. I had considered many different ideas such as the few mentioned on this and other subs but I've come to my conclusions and want to see what you guys think of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why hasn't anyone gotten into the good place in over 500 years?

A: The Printing press

In more broad strokes, the acceleration of technology. It past times before the printing press people couldn't hear the word of god prior except at church. Religion held the religious text's and getting copies was incredibly difficult. Not just because of the church's grasp on them but also getting one made was incredibly difficult. After the invention of the printing press the word was now available to anyone who wanted it. But that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. After all isn't more readily available knowledge a good thing? Yes but then no. What the printing press, and subsequently the acceleration of technology, caused us to do is not have to meet to hear the word or otherwise converse. We were no longer around each other AS much and thus the need to improve each other was lessened.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of season 2 Eleanor watches a lecture done by Chidi titled ""What do we owe each other?"". In it Chidi postulates the innate desire to be good does not come from a potential reward, because we have no confirmation of a reward. Instead it comes from our bonds with other people and our innate desire to treat other with dignity. 

&amp;#x200B;

However that has diminished. Bonds between people have lessened. As people have become more connected their bonds that truly connected them have weakened. South park explores this in their episode about friends on facebook. How many friends in your facebook feed truly are your friends? Is there a deep bond that forces you to treat them good and with dignity?

&amp;#x200B;

The invention of the printing press both made people more connected intellectually but less connected personally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What is the series pushing towards as their big reveal?

A: The maybe the reason the 4 have improved is because they have connected in a more personal form.

The biggest trait all four share with each other is that in their real life there was no bond between them and others. Eleanor purposefully shrank from creating bonds, Chidi shut himself off from the world severing bonds, Tahani create superficial bonds in the search for her parents approval, and Jason bonded with people who felt no obligation back. They all failed to create true personal connections that would push them to be good in a genuine way. The reason Doug Forcett is not making it too the good place is because he is following the letter of the law but shutting himself off from the world and not creating the personal connections which drive a natural desire to be good. He is treating it like a video game high score.

&amp;#x200B;

People as a whole slowly lost this personal bond over the years due to the advancement of technology. The world grew but the circle of people in which you created long bonds with grew smaller and smaller. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think this will be the result of the the series examination. All the question will be posed that can these types of personal bonds be achievable in today's technologically advanced society. I also believe the answer is yes and for the reason people have failed to get into the good place. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Q: How will they fix the point system?

A: By using it against itself.

We learned in season 3 that the point system is flawed because even a small purchase can result in misery for countless people. It is a cascade that seems impossible to overcome. However there is a side to that they have not explored. When you perform a general good there is a cascading effect that can result from that as well. If I shop at a Walmart yes the things I buy may cause countless people misery. However if I donate money to a charity then the multiple people that it may overall affect should could into the point total as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The old system is grading people base on this old system of personal bonds and individual actions and results. However the new world requires a new system. The American Cancer Society has helped over 11 million people enjoy life past the disease. If I raised 400 dollars for them then I have in some small way contributed to that 11 million people. It may not be directly but I have done it indirectly in the same way purchasing a t-shirt from target has contributed to the misery of others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Q: So what is the message?

A: Humanity as a whole has become much more good, but not in a well rounded way.

We as a species have become better. It may not feel like it at times the reality is we have. We no longer think of the personal bonds. We think of our species as a whole. How is my life impacting the world? What am I doing to make the world I live in a better place? There will always people who don't think this way but the majority do. But because of how easily connected we are to all the bad it's harder to see. It's hard to see how $1 towards children's miracle network does any good but we see the problems that are created by supporting irresponsible companies. Back before the printing press this was not easily seen. We are much more aware of our presence now more than ever but we certainly haven't gotten worse for it.

&amp;#x200B;

What we have failed to do is impact the world we live in on a much more personal scale because of thinking on a much larger scale. Much like Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason we haven't looked at the world in front of us. Eleanor takes a step in that direction after her near death experience. Jason Forcett does look at the world in front of him but doesn't consider the big picture.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to do both to truly become a better person. We need to think of how we affect the world around us on a large scale but remember that the small contributions to big problems have helped. However we also need to consider the every day things which we encounter. The person stranded on the side of the road. The person in line short on money. These personal bonds are what pushes us to be better in the end because they feel more impactful. They immediately show us that our good deeds have immediate rewards and that more longer last good deeds can have longer lasting rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I now need to get to bed but I had to type this up because I've been thinking about it all day. I hope you enjoyed the rather long post and feel free to give criticism, input, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: The message and final reveal is that the points system is old fashioned and needs to incorporate a technology rich world in which everyone is connected. The printing press caused people not to get into the good place because it removed the need to meet and create connections.",1,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

Then tahani says I have some right here and gives him a saltine.

Were just supposed to BELIEVE that tahani, the pinnacle of posh, just had a plate of saltines out at her fancy party in her mansion? Within arms reach??

No, the only explanation is that tahani is a demon who is torturing Michael who is ACTUALLY in his own bad place while also torturing the others!! 

But how deep does this rabbit hole go? 

In season two episode one Eleanor reads a note from herself telling her to find chidi. And she speculates that Chidi might be a soup. And you know what goes great with soup?

SALTINES.
