They could then maybe use this to argue that behaviour on earth shouldn't be the only indication of whether someone is good or bad and maybe convince the judge to take their progress after life into consideration. 

One of the arguments of the judge was that Eleanor has only improved because she wants to get to the good place. But wouldn't the same be true for most, if not all, people on earth? They are good because they want to get to heaven or they are scared of the consequences. Then once they get to the good place, they are faced with a system where there are no consequences, they can't die because they are already dead, they can't get arrested and no one is watching anymore. And at the same time they can simply ask Janet for cocaine at any time, for example... Plus, if everything is always great, people are bound to get bored.

* We will ""know immediately what they're trying to do with the season"" by the end of the first or second episode, so it'll probably be a familiar format

My guess is that Season 3 is gonna take the format and idea of a roommates/apartment sitcom like Frasier, Friends, Seinfield, New Girl, etc. It's an immediately recognizable sitcom trope that would definitely give us the feeling of ""ok yup i know exactly what they're trying to do"", it would obviously have a doorman character work very well, and it would be an arrangement that would be very easy to stably get everyone back together at the start of the season.

2. Tahani crushed by a statue
3. Jason suffocated in a safe
4. Chidi hit by an air conditioning unit
5. Mindy fallen into subway tracks and electrocuted by the third rail

I understand why these deaths were chosen - the four humans of Team Cockroach are essentially killed by their own vices and flaws, and the circumstances that lead Mindy to be in the Medium Place only work if she dies prematurely. However, this leaves us with a giant gap in the lore of the show. What happens to people who die of old age? Illness? What about people who die as children? Do you think well meet more humans with more diverse experiences, or do you think well continue to just see youngish adults who died violently because its better from a comedy perspective? How do you envision the afterlife works for people who die of old age? Do they stay that age when they die, or do they wake up in the afterlife as a younger version of themselves?

Hear me out. Doug Forcett was most likely in his mid twentys in the 1970s when his picture was taken which puts him in his late 60s in modern day. Eleanors dad is also called Doug and given his appearance during Eleanors flashbacks, 60-70 years old seems like a fair guess. Meaning the timeline matches up. We also know that both were stoners/frequent drug abusers. 
Now my theory is that Doug got in some sort of trouble and decided to change his name from Forcett to Shellstrop; being quite an odd name it makes it likely that he made it up. 
However this does bode the question of how Eleanor didnt recognise the photo, however during Doug Shellstrops funeral, Eleanors mum told Eleanor that the mug shot was the only photo they could find of him making us wonder why there were so little photos of him. Perhaps because he didnt want his photo taken to protect himself from whatever he ran away from. The photo on Michaels wall could be a replica of a photo long since destroyed. Perhaps a photo that Eleanor noticed in that first episode as a result of her subconscious recognising her father.

Michaels project showed humans (at least our 4 humans) are capable of changing from bad to good/ less bad.

Will Mike advocate for a place where humans can go after death to take lessons or try to learn to be good?

Isn't that what earth is supposed to be for?

Will they argue that a specific person or people are necessary to make a person good?

Will a good place Michael work with the bad place Michael to create an effective trial for the afterlife.

Michael says people might have ended up in the good place if they ""got a push in the right direction."" Is the goal that everyone on earth ""gets a push in the right direction""?

Basically what I am getting at is if time on earth is not good enough a trial, then what would the trial be?

Will humans headed to the bad place all be giving a second chance to go to the good place? Wouldn't people headed to the good place also be able to change for the worse?

When Eleanor goes back to ""earth"" and Michael pushes her out of the way of the shopping carts she does a 180 and starts being good up until her roommate finds out about the shirts, she gets sued and goes back to her bad people habits. If Eleanor dies right before that she would presumably go to the good place. if she dies after she would presumably go to the bad place. Sam Malone once again gives her a push in the right direction at the bar and leads her to Chidi. She will take ethics lessons from Chidi and if she died after learning to be a good person, she'd presumably go to the good place.

Mindy St Claire is in a similar boat. If she dies a day earlier, before trying to be goo, she would have gone to the bad place. If she dies days after turning her life around she would have gone to the good place. Because she dies at the moment she dies, shes sent to the medium place.

In my opinion a second chance plan would be a slippery slope. How many second chances are enough to prove a person deserves to go to the good place or the bad place. If people can't be proved to be definitively good or bad, then the after life in the show is null since the afterlife is supposed to be a consequence (either good or bad) to peoples actions.",18,17,False,self,,,,,

At the very end of ""Somewhere Else"" Eleanor stops to look at a map and a strange man approaches wearing a red bandana. [Who is this man?](https://imgur.com/a/KF3QdeZ) Do you know? [I didn't catch it on the first watch, but I started listening to the Good Place Podcast and then began a rewatch. In one of the first episodes of the podcast, Michael Shur specifically mentions that they avoided having the color red appear so as not to subconsciously tip anyone off to the big reveal. Now we have a strange, random person wearing a red BANDANA. Nobody wears bandanas seriously. Plus it's red.](/spoilers) 

&amp;nbsp;

[And what does this weird dude wearing the color that subtle is meant to remind us of the devil ask Eleanor? ""Do you want to speak with God?"" Eleanor rebuffs him like a creepy weirdo because who the fork would come up and ask a stranger if they want to speak with God...creepy weirdos... or the Devil in disguise. Isn't that the most basic trick in the Devil's toolbox? Convince the humans that the way to power, way to divinity, way to God is actually through Satan.](/spoilers)

&amp;nbsp;

[But why would the Devil appear at right that moment trying to distract our heroine? Eleanor was just about to find Chidi, therefore setting the team on a path to prove their goodness. Which would also, therefore, call into question the entire system of Good/Bad and the judgment that has been wrong for hundreds of millions of humans. Gen's ""Damn, that was intense!"" moment is what we're talking about here. ""I got goosebumps."" Now, what immortal being might be particularly interested in keeping the status quo of a broken system that nets him hundreds of millions of souls to torture? Lucifer.](/spoilers)

(1)  One of her angriest complaints against her parents was that they stole her college fund and kept her from going to university.

(2) When she started lessons with Chidi, it soon stopped being a matter of pretending to be good and she got genuinely interested in what she was studying.

(3) During their visit to the Really Bad Place, Chidi learns that Eleanor has read ahead in her philosophy book.

(4) Even when she is severely depressed in ""Somewhere Else"",  listening to Chidi's Internet lecture piques her interest.

What does this all amount to?  ELEANOR LIKES TO LEARN, even though she plays dumb at times.   And this particular virtue is what leads to her self-improvement in the Good Place, and maybe will rescue her in the current Earth-simulation.

I have taken a few sitcom writing courses and tried to make my own writing groups but its hard to find people with the same drive or schedule.

Anyway I made this post to ask for a hand from anyone has some pull at TGP and can get me on the crew in any capacity. Dont need pay. Ill sweep, shine shoes, change light bulbs, anything really, for the chance to learn on set. I'd be more than happy to introduce myself and go over my previous work experience.

We already have a pretty good idea of what Eleanor and chidi will be doing in the beginning of the season at least. He will be teaching her, and she will have difficulty becoming better, but she will end up being an incredible student and will learn a lot.

Moving on:
I believe that because Janet has been rebooted so many times, she will be considered a hazard by the creators of Janets so they will attempt to dispose of her, and Michael will have to try and deal with that. I also believe that because Michael did more than a push as he so rightfully put it, in 213, that Jen (Maya Rudolph) will punish him but because his intervention at the one year mark after the experiment began, was carefully worded, his punishment will be different. I believe that Michael will be put into the life of a human, he will be randomly placed on Earth, with memories of a life and he will be forced to do the same thing the four humans are doing. I think he is the one who will bring all four of them together. (More of this later.)

As seen in the photos, (entertainment weekly) Tahani is wearing an outfit traditional of travelers in Haiti, which goes with the storyline that was to happen before she died. The way she is looking at whatever she is seeing, is reminiscent of someone having a realization. I think Tahani will a realization that she needs to be more hands on with dealing with these problems around the world and stop worrying about her families approval, and this will lead her to florida. Jason appears in the photos to be leading his 60 person dance crew. Tahani will most likely go to florida, because, as Michael schur said in the podcast for episode 113, everything wrong that happens can somehow be traced back to Florida. She will go there, and they will run into each other, and she will see him as someone to rescue from stupidity probably. That is how they will find each other.

And on the return:
By Michael being in the simulation of life, he will most likely be devilish, since he will have no memory of the events of the first two seasons. I think he will go far because bad people tend to go far in this world. Tahani will end up getting money from him for a relief, and they will become friends and as she is starting to become better, she will infect him with goodness, and he will find chidi and Eleanor, and he will bring all four together.

This may be a little out there, but I would love to hear everyones thoughts or own personal theories as to where season 3 is going.",19,36,False,self,,,,,

Chidi and Eleanor eventually find each other, but I feel like we wouldnt see much of their travels to the medium place. Wed see Michael scrambling to torture whoever of the 4 is still left in TGP, while trying to find Eleanor (and whoever is with her) 

[B]Do you think we would like the 4 main characters? Who out of the four do you think we would dislike the most? [/B] I feel like from his prospective, the four would be unlikeable, theyre always interrupting his plans. For me, I think it would probably be Tahani, because out of all of them, shes the least aware of her wrong doings. Shes always shocked to find out shes in the bad place. Jason is stupid, but he knows he shouldnt be there so wed probably just be annoyed for his stupidity, not because hes completely unaware hes not supposed to be in heaven. every time Chidi finds out hes in the bad place he goes Almond milk - although hes wrong about the reason, deep down he knew he didnt belong there. I feel like Eleanor would still be one of the main characters, so wed see a lot of her and her smarts. People would dislike her for being a bad personality on earth, but theyd respect her perseverance and dedication.
