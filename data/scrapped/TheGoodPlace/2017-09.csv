I didn't think they were in our concept of hell, I just thought they were in ""a place"" and it was an experiment of sorts to see if people could be good because you told them they were good.

The actuality of it being a bad place for the four main characters specifically and everyone else being part of a Truman show type thing for the demons kind of soured things for me. It made some things in the past make less sense and it hurts the rewatch value of the first season.

All that being said things going my way would have made future seasons more like a traditional sitcom just set in the afterlife more so than the mystery thriller plot line it now has. ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's Limbo.

This is the place where Eleanor became a better person, the place where she was *happy* because she was becoming a better person. 

I believe this place is a stasis where people remain until they are worthy to go to the real 'Good Place.'

Either way, loving the show, just thought I'd throw that out there.

Each episode centers around a key conflict that needs to be resolved, and then in the next episode there's another, and then another.

Maybe after the issue with Mindy, some people in the Good Place thought there should be a place where people could come to the afterlife and redeem themselves but the Bad Place rejected the idea. They couldn't experiment with the idea in the Good Place because they couldn't get ""bad"" people there... so they had to figure out a way to do it in the Bad Place.  Insert Michael who is sent from the Good Place to the Bad Place (with a Janet) to become an architect and conduct the experiment. The problem with version 1 was that all four didn't redeem themselves before they discovered the secret. The reason Michael was so desperate for another chance was because he really is trying to save them and needed another chance for the experiment to succeed.

This could be a lot of fun as Michael would need to keep everyone in the dark, including his boss and co-workers, trying to convince them what he's doing is diabolical but also trying to nudge Eleanor and company towards redemption.

However, Eleanor has managed to inadvertently thwart his plans by confessing mid-season, which the show justifies her doing by saying she's learned from Chidi's lessons and example to be more ethical/considerate. She's grown. 

However, I believe that the Eleanor of the Good Place is completely inconsistent with Earth Eleanor. Her growth begins as a result of a decision that Earth Eleanor would've never made: trusting Chidi with the knowledge that she doesn't belong there.

What we learn about Eleanor through flashbacks is that her parents completely ignored her, to the point of willingly emancipating her. Other flashbacks show Eleanor aggressively pushing potential friends away - it is clear that Eleanor's experience with her parents has taught her not to get close to anyone, as then she won't be disappointed or hurt when they fail her, like her parents. Eleanor pushes everyone away.

Why then, merely moments after meeting Chidi, would Eleanor ask him:

ELEANOR: ""Chidi. If you are my soulmate, that means that you would never hurt me, for any reason?""

CHIDI: ""Of course not!""

ELEANOR: ""Promise me. Say, I promise I will never betray you.

He agrees, and she confesses. 

This is absolutely out of character. We're supposed to believe that Eleanor spends her entire life pushing people away - horribly, blatantly, vulgarly - because she's afraid they'll betray her like her parents. Then, she gets to ""heaven,"" realizes she should be sent to hell, and immediately decides to trust a stranger with that knowledge, instead of keeping it to herself? She actively exposes herself to betrayal after a lifetime of vigorously avoiding any chance of being betrayed?

That is just unbelievable. 

That decision is, unfortunately, a HUGE one for the show. It is what prompts her to take lessons with Chidi, leading to her redemption by confessing, the foiling of Michael's plan, and them all having their memories wiped. 

What's worse, the moment her memory is wiped, she attempts to repeat the same behavior with Chris the Mailman, asking if he will betray her. We can't even argue that she and Chidi have some deep, cosmic connection justifying her confiding in him. She was gonna tell whoever she was matched with. 

This inconsistency is a huge one, and makes it hard for me to enjoy Eleanor as a character. She is so comically mean in flashbacks, but normally cynical in the Good Place. She is purposely vulgar and nasty on Earth, but suddenly has a conscience in heaven. The two don't read like the same person. And that makes it difficult to invest in her redemption, or just understand who she is supposed to be. ",11,15,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Has anyone noticed that Michael and Glenn hate each other?**



It seems to me that just about every interaction between them belies this, and since next season will focus more on Michael's perspective than on our fighting foursome, we can probably expect to see this play out even more.



There may be additional pieces of evidence to support this, but here are the big three I found:


    
* When our crew sits down to eat at The Good Plates restaurant, Michael asks if anyone wants to share the story of their favorite meal. Glenn immediately volunteers, eliciting a sour look from Michael.


    
* In the final episode, we see a flashback of Michael proposing his plan (just before the entrance of the lava monster). Note Glenn sitting at the middle right of the conference table. The other three at the table are smiling, at least a little. Glenn, by contrast, looks bored and/or disdainful. When Michael mentions ""the lightning that tears off [bad people's] flesh,"" Glenn reacts by rolling his eyes and deepening his judgmental look.


    
* In *The Eternal Shriek,* when Michael says that he soon won't be around, Glenn happily explains, ""because of the eternal shriek!"", a fact that no one's in danger of forgetting, and which no polite individual would feel the need to shout.



* Tahani is upset by this (which is perhaps Glenn's intention?), but we also see Michael purse his lips and look away from Glenn's direction after this outburst. He then briefly glowers in a sinister-enough way before, upon being addressed by Tahani, startling back to his 'good guy' persona.




Whenever the spotlight's on Michael, Glen seems to try to insert himself. 
Why?



Maybe he felt upstaged by Michael's plan? Maybe he's just old school and doesn't support this new gambit? Maybe it's a case of a longstanding rivalry? 



Whatever the cause, there's some lost love between these two, and I hope we see more of it in the upcoming season.







~~ Bonus items I just noticed on this watch through~~


* It's been suggested (and possibly hinted at by the creators?) that the Medium Place was supposed to be a real place, and actually out of the Bad Place's control. I haven't seen anything on the show to directly contradict this.



* It's also been suggested that the final arch of the show will be a re-twist; i.e. Michael will turn out to be a ""secret agent"" from the Good Place, placed long ago in the bad place, in order to determine whether bad people can change their ""goodness"" levels after they die by helping each other. Nothing in Danson's performance would be out of place if this long scheme were true. 



* Guess who else was at that conference table during Michael's proposal? The woman (dressed identically in yellow) from the 1st episode's explanation of Good Place soulmates.",7,13,False,self,,,,,

The Good Place has a lot elements of the Wizard of Freaking Oz

* Chidi is the Cowardly Lion (lacking confidence and courage)

* Jason/Jianu is the Tin Man (lacking a brain)

* Tahani is the Straw(wo)man (lacking a heart; performing good deeds in order to fill her own neediness.)

Working together the 4 get each other closer to filling what they are seeking.

* Michael is The Wizard (You start off thinking he's this all powerful, altruistic figure, and at the end this is flipped on it's head)

Still working on this part:

* Janet as The Good Witch

* Bad Janet as The Bad Witch(?)

* Day Player Demons Neighbors as Flying Monkies, though you assumed they were munchkins

I love this show. The acting's wonderful, the set design is  just-so distinctive, but the one thing that really lures me in to watch episodes again is the show's writing. I think we can all agree, The Good Place writers are the forking shirt.

Every episode seems to have a lot of well-placed, clever details. With less than a week to go until the season two premiere, I thought it'd be fun to collect a big list of as many tidbits as we can find. I know there must be plenty I've neglected or overlooked, so if you've spotted others, please post them!

~~~

POINT-SCORING 

 -In the initial video of good/bad actions and their positive/negative impacts, ""Tell a Woman to 'Smile:' (-53.83 points)"" flashes by on the right side of the screen. 

No surprise, then, when in episode 8 and 9, Trevor twice tells Eleanor to 'smile' (1st time: ""Oh, also, you should smile more,"" as Eleanor's about to board the train; 2nd time: ""I'm still waiting on that smile,"" in Michael's office).

Other especially fun point-totaling actions from this and the next screen:

 -""Fix Broken Tricycle for Child who Loves Tricycles (+4.58)."" Directly below, ""Fix Tricycle for Child Who is Indifferent to Tricycles (+0.04)."" Pretty big point difference!

 - ""Began to Compose Social Media Post About David Bowie Dying and Then Thought 'The world doesn't need to hear my thoughts on David Bowie': (+215.89.)'"" Speaks for itself. Or rather, doesn't.

 - ""Helped Mom with her Printer (x339): (+60.09)."" How many times have you helped your parent with theirs? 

and 

 - ""Attended Cousin's Friend's Child's Jazz Dance Recital: (+27.04)."" So much unrelatedness.


~~~

**Other small, easy-to-miss consistencies**:

 - At the beginning of episode three, Michael bans flying, citing the unpleasant fact that one resident collided midair with a turkey carcass. 

Later, when Eleanor hears from residents impacted by her subterfuge, one specifically recounts the turkey incident in grievance.

 - Also in episode three, we see Michael criticizing Chidi's life's work. Just as Chidi flees the room, Michael puts a fist to his mouth to, presumably, stifle glee and, just before the shot cuts out, Michael's lip turns up at the corner in a smile. Early signs of Michael's true nature.

 ~~~

Bonus fun questions to consider:

1. In the first episode, Michael describes each resident's house as, ""a home that perfectly matches his or her's true essence."" What would yours look like?  


2. In Michael's Gambit, Michael claims he can keep the four fighting a thousand years, while Sean says he thinks Michael would be lucky to last 6 months. Their reactions lead us to believe that the season's worth of time was less than 6 months, but how much time exactly do you think has passed? Weeks? Months? Do you think season two will run the same length of time?

**Bambadjan** - Role unchanged as a background character specializing in law        
**Angelique** - Chidi's new soul mate    
**Chris Baker** - Already confirmed as Eleanor's new soul mate    
**Ken Luang** - My guess is a new background character or soul mate for Jason       
**Joaquin Ticonderoga** - My guess as a new soulmate for Tahani     
**The ""Real"" Eleanor (Vicky)** - does not appear to show in the next season at all, at least not the actress.

I actually really loved how they did it, especially for a show that has moved super fast the entire first season.

&amp;nbsp;


As I was watching the season 2 premiere, I noticed the classical music played at the evening gala was the same as in season 1 - of course this makes sense since Michael kept most things the same.

But the choice of music is probably not a coincidence - it's the aria of *Papageno* in Mozart's *Magic Flute*. Though there are only superficial thematic parallels between the show and the opera, the lyrics of the aria serve to introduce *Papageno* as a bird-catcher - telling us of his prowess of luring and caging them, how ""all the birds"" are surely his...

I guess a coincidence is possible - but the symbolic parallel between the deceptive catcher luring the bird into its cage and Michael's game is so stark, I'd be surprised if this wasn't a little easter-egg for people who listen to classical music.

Jason x Janet: The only 100% canon ship that is also perfect.

Eleanor x Chidi: This is the standard relationship of the show. It works, but I'm still not sure Chidi's even attracted to Eleanor at this point. We know she likes him, but she really doesn't seem like his type and apparently that's important to him. Still, this could work if they put more effort on Chidi's side of things.

Vicky x Chidi: Bear with me... this could work. We know she's jealous of other people that get to torture him, and she was really into her role as real Eleanor... maybe that could have translated into a sort of obsession that might become love.

Eleanor x Tahani: This is another one that seems one sided with Eleanor clearly being into Tahani despite kinda hating her and Tahani being into... mostly herself honestly. Once again, this could work if the writers put in time.

Season 1. This show was set up to make you comfortable in the idea that this was a trope-y sitcom set in heaven, BUT I think the promos could have highlighted the witty, clever humor and compared it to shows like Arrested Development in order to help the audience find it.

Between 1 and 2. 

- WHY WASN'T THIS SHOW REBROADCAST DURING THE SUMMER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?! WHY!

- Why wasn't the DVD released a week or two ago? Especially to create viral buzz via special features content!

- I've seen ads on tv that give a ton away, I've heard ads on the radio that lack any pull, the @nbcgoodplace instagram person sucks and doesn't seem like they have watched the show or realize the gif/viral gold mine they have.

- The new season premiere after the finale of AGT, in theory, to catch that crowd, but I'm on the west coast at it was so late at night! 10 pm on a WEEKNIGHT!

- Now they are going to move it to Thursdays. Isn't a very [basic programming rule](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ScrewedByTheNetwork/LiveActionTV) that NBC should know by now (cough, cough, Community) is to not shuffle shows?

It sucks I didn't get a chance to let the show bamboozle me, but I loved watching Ted Danson play the nice guy incredibly well (especially since Cheers is my favorite TV sitcom ever, hands down).


But to my point:  during the final episode, we see a flashback where Michael pitches The Good Place experiment to his bosses.  He quickly mentions he managed to steal a Good Janet to give his Faux Good Place an extra layer of realism.  But how easy would it be for Michael to get his hands on a Good Janet?  Is it a matter of ""hacking"" into The Good Place's mainframe &amp; downloading a good Janet, or is Janet's incubation form a tangible object which someone could conceivably steal?  Regardless, I doubt The Good Place makes mistakes very often - my guess is someone (or someones) let Michael take Janet.


But why?  Besides singlehandedly running every Good Place on their own, Janets are able to learn with every reboot.  But I can't imagine most Janets are rebooted as often as ours, making all the personality developments with our Janet uncharted territory.  


Michael also constantly tinkers with Janet's programming to give her the illusion of personality quirks and feelings.  But what if he unwittingly gave Janet the building blocks for true sentience?  By the end of season 1, Janet has verbally expressed Love (for Jason) and Hate (for walking), and even writes a failsafe protocol into her programming so she can be even more loyal to Jason.  And whether or not her Ride-or-Die protocol is still in effect in the second Good Place, the fact remains Janet learned a lot of human tendencies from Jason, good and bad.  Traits &amp; flaws like that are what make us human, and they'll likely give Janet individuality.

During the episode, I realized that every soulmate pairing on the show was in a heterosexual relationship- except for Jason, who was placed in a strictly platonic relationship with another man, which is very apt torture for a person like Jason. While Eleanor has had flirtations with Tahani, there have only been mandated heterosexual couplings in the Bad Place. While the Bad Place we see in the show offers a pretty small sample size- since the only people that we truly know have been subjugated to the Bad Place are Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason- it still informs us a little bit about what sexuality might be like in the Good Place. It's unlikely that the show would be going with the fundamentalist Christian ideology that the LGBTQ+ community would be placed in the Bad Place as we have not yet seen that represented in this show. So, it's entirely possible that the Good Place allows people to be with whatever partner they want. The Bad Place we are introduced to also sets things up so that the relationships are strictly monogamous, which might be something else that varies in the Good Place. However, it is worth noting that the show is based on the premise coming from Sartre's philosophy that ""Hell is other people"" and if hell is other people, then what does that make heaven? Other people might be completely removed from the Good Place and sexuality would be of little importance there. But the Bad Place informs us that monogamous, heterosexual relationships are consistent throughout this one grouping and it might be consistent throughout others too- depending on how it is deemed best fit to torture them.",11,3,False,self,,,,,

The only way forward is for Michael to accept that and work it into the plan. Therefore Michael needs to let Eleanor in on ""The Good Place"" and get her to work for him before she blurts it out to the others.

Based on the names of future episodes listed [here](https://www.tvtime.com/en/show/311711/episode/6141747) (Thanks /u/MadDoctor5813 for that link.) I'm guessing that ep. 5 ""Existential Crisis"" has Michael breaking down and coming to the above conclusion about Eleanor with the final scene being an ""Eleanor, we need to chat"" moment. At this point he probably recognizes that spark she gets in her eyes when she's about to pull ""an Eleanor"".

Also, I should note, I'm counting the hour long premiere as ep. 1-2 whereas the site linked just counts it as ep. 1.

Ep. 6 ""The Trolley Problem"" picks up with the recruitment pitch. Basically Eleanor has the choice between helping to torture the other three herself or allowing them greater torture (butt spiders and penis flatteners) at the hands of someone else. The kicker will be that she herself will be tortured as well if she refuses to cooperate but that motivation will fade in importance by the end of the season.

Ep. 7 ""Janet and Michael"" could be a flashback episode about Michael stealing Janet from a real good place, but I think it'll actually be about Michael needing a confidant of some sorts and Janet is as close to neutral as he can find. He still needs to torture Eleanor so he'll have to work that into how he forces her to torture the others. The other demons can't know that she's in on it so he has no allies there. Janet, although seemingly more aligned with the humans and Jason in particular, may be obligated to follow direct orders from Michael, him being the architect of her domain.

[Spoiler],https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7292xv/is_the_point_system_even_real_spoiler/,WifiLlama,1506300152,"This is something that just occurred to me. I could very well be reading too far into things, but here goes: do we actually know for sure that the morality point system seen throughout the show is the actual method used to determine whether humans go to the Good or Bad place? I believe it's possible that the concept of the points method is something Micheal invented as yet another way of torturing the humans.


The most example is Tahani, who for a while is horrified with her ""low"" ranking in comparison to the other residents of the neighborhood. Since we know the other residents are really just actors and as such wouldn't have morality scores even if the system IS real, it's safe to say that Micheal intended for Tahani to find those scores - why else would they exist? It also explains why he would leave such critical information just lying around. Admittedly, while this shows that the scores everyone has have definitely been faked, it doesn't *necessarily* prove that the points system itself is fake, as there could be ""real"" scores out there somewhere. 
It affects other characters too. For Eleanor, it's held over her head as a way of categorically proving that she's just *terrible*. In the finale, she has a line about how this must be her hell because she's surrounded by people who are much better than her, which the points system reinforces. When it comes to Chidi, this is just speculation on my part as I don't think there are any specific examples in the show, but you just *know* that as a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, he must be having a a lot of sleepless nights grappling with the fact that human morality is dictated by a purely binary good/bad points system.


A couple of possible arguments against this theory spring to mind for me: first, we see an actual points counter in the show, towards the end when Eleanor is trying to prove she's earned her right to stay in the good place. Now, Micheal could just be using it to taunt the humans with the fact that nothing they do seems to make it go up, but the fact that it suddenly jumps up when Eleanor decides to surrender herself to the bad place (which I don't think Micheal was expecting?) would imply that the point system is actually fully functional and is tracking Eleanor's actions, and not just something Micheal was controlling manually to torture the gang with. The other problem is that while in the Medium Place, Eleanor mentions the point system and Mindy seems to know what it is, implying it really is the system used. However, this one can be chalked down to Mindy simply assuming Eleanor was using a figure of speech in her line about whether or not Mindy should get the points for her actions. Also, both of these issues can be explained if you believe that the Medium Place was also part of Micheal's elaborate setup and that he planned the whole thing, though I, for the record, do not.


Anyway, if anybody's still reading this, that's my theory on the points system! I'd love to hear what you guys think!",15,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

In Version 2, we find out that it's Michael's plan to get Eleanor drunk, and Tahani ends up getting drunk instead. At no point do we see either character asking Janet about how to get drunk.

This brings up a couple of interesting inconsistencies between the two versions. I'm not sure if it's just an oversight in writing, or it actually indicates a difference in the way that the party in each version was planned.

Questions worth considering:

1. Was it Michael's plan for Eleanor to get drunk in Version 1?

2. If so, why did he leave it up to Eleanor to ask Janet how to get drunk? Wouldn't it have been much safer to just allow her to get drunk by default?

(long),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/72ma45/yet_another_theory_long/,Andalusian_Dawn,1506449845,"I just finished season 1 on Netflix, and I am so impressed with the show! I've been thinking about some things, and have a few theories, that may or may not be true.

1. I LOVE Trevor. He's probably one of my favorite characters, and I'm not so sure he's part of the Bad Place. I did read the earlier post 8 months ago about a Trevor theory, and I think the poster was on the right track.  I kind of am beginning to suspect Trevor (and possibly his crew) is way better than he appears. He says some genuinely nice things to Eleanor, especially about how he likes her smile multiple times. It wasn't done in sleazy, creepy dude way either. He also sat and pretty much gave her psychotherapy, trying to get her to leave, while they were drinking at the bar. Also, he ASKED her whether she would sleep with him. I can't see a demon asking.  It seems like he has flashes of 'niceness"" like Michael has flashes of ""evilness"" that aren't obvious until watching the season again.

  His crew, while doing karaoke, literally did not SAY the words that were on the screen.  Isn't that the point of karaoke? To literally say what's on the screen?  They just mouthed them while making mean faces. Like they were pretending. And I'll be damned myself if a demon doesn't know  how to tap a keg. They've never drank in their unlives. They're also snorting TIME???  They've never done drugs before either. They are the most awkward demons I've ever seen. It's like they're pretending to be bad and emulating the brattiest teenagers they could find. I'm not sure if Trevor might not be a rival Bad Place architect, but I'm beginning to wonder, since they're all so INEPT at being bad.

2. I don't believe Michael for a moment when he tells Tahani that she has nothing left to prove after she dies. Michael lies CONSTANTLY.  Of course he doesn't want her to improve! I'm also of the opinion that the point system is shows how BAD someone is, not how good.  Tahani is at the bottom because, really, the only things she did wrong were her motivation and her pride about how she was better than everyone else.  Jason/Jianyu is definitely the worst of the lot and highest on the list, with Eleanor close behind.  I do wonder how Glenn is the best of everyone in the neighborhood if I'm right, since he's a demon, right?  

My full theory is that people in the Bad Place can improve and get out of there. It's a place of rehabilitation, but of course, the demons don't want their neighborhoods depopulated and their amusement gone. They're going to prevent people from learning, by frustrating them and not letting them see any other good people. I believe that it is possible to get out, and Trevor and his crew (who may possibly be Good Place angels or the like) are interested because Eleanor is the first person EVER to have a chance at redemption. Which is why Trevor keeps telling her ""You don't belong here. You'd be happier with us.""  The reason the others don't have the same chance is because they each have to resolve their own issues, and they're not. Yet. 

3.  My wildest theory that I am just playing around with, is that Good Janet is God and Bad Janet is the devil. Religion has gotten more sophisticated over the ages, and so has Janet. And, she is in every neighborhood, Good or Bad, and is the only thing that can create objects, like a god does. I think she was there at the beginning of time, and both sides have disagreements on how to use her. This is pretty far fetched and I'm still working on it, so sorry!

So the whole ""point"" of this Bad Place is that Michael gets to make a hell where the people ""torture eachother"" and that's good and all, but then as it fails he plans to ""split them up"" and with Eleanor waking up to a new dude we're under the impression they won't meet eachother that easily, maybe ever (if all goes by Michael's plan)?

BUT, what's the point at the end of S1 anymore? 'Cause if the humans don't torture one another and they have to have all these ""workers"" there to fill in did he not just make another standard Bad Place? 'Cause these ""extras"" still have to work, but instead of performing ""classical torture"" they now have to work with this new type of torture.

Is his point of making a new type of Bad Place not in fact void at the end of season 1 as he now must interfere much more in his original plans?",8,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

From there I partially predicted the twist. 
And with the focus on moral philosophy from Chidi (and finishing an into to philosophy class a a month ago) I was primed to look for more.
when Tahani's life was shown I realized the inspiration NO EXIT! By Jean-Paul Sartre! 

 in the season one Finale when they were in the room alone andEleanor said ""this is torture"" I knew I was right! 

For those uninitiated no exit is a philosophical play about 4 people in a single room in hell torturing each other. Sound familiar?  
So I believe The final form of the good place project will be Michael taking groups of 4 Putting them together and moving people around if they ask. 

This system solves everything for Michael 

Humans torture each other 
it only takes one demon for every human ever, 

 if they realize what is happening it doesn't matter,

And best of all There is literally no way to mess up,

He's never tortured. His tortures are not tortures, they're inconveniences.

Jason places his hand on Michael twice in the show and it actually helps. There's no reason for Michael to be gas-lighting Jason about this, so what if it's actually working to calm him down?

When Jason is ""trying"" to have sex with Janet, he's off screen. He's off screen a lot actually. Even in version 2 of The Good Place, he needs to get away from his ""best friend"" to report back in to his boss.

So what brought him here? well, it's one small tiny thing that Michael said - they _stole_ the Janet and that drew the attention of the angels. So, they sent one who is pretending to be dumb.

Every time he has said or done something stupid, he has ended up pushing Eleanor to make a moral choice and she has always chosen to do the right thing.

So then let's analyse the trip to the middle place. Eleanor goes with Janet and Jason. Jason was at first not going to go he attempted to leave, but Eleanor was the one that insisted she wanted to go.

When there, she realised she didn't want to be there after all, she was better than this and needed to face the music. If you watch when they are leaving for the middle place it's Jason and Janet at the controls. Jason is telling Janet where to take them.

On the way back, Janet waits for Jason to give the go ahead for them to return. Jason is playing Eleanor and he made sure was choosing the moral path before letting them go back. He was testing her.

The Good Place experiment isn't just failing because it was a bad idea, it's failing because it's proving that the people currently going to the bad place can become better and now Jason has to stay and see how it turns out.

I believe that like others have suggested, version 3 will end in a mess once more as the season progresses the demons will start learning morality from our heroes and Michael will have to keep the charade going to avoid getting destroyed.

Jason will have to step in and save him and The Good Place from destruction because it will have truly become a good place, a new kind of middle place where lost souls can rehabilitate.",17,64,False,self,,,,,

If it were just a matter of her having the information but not being able/knowing to share it unless directly asked, we'd expect her to remember her marriage with Jason, etc. (Sidenote: I'm so curious whether they hooked up in any of the hundreds upon hundreds of reboots. You'd think so, right?)

But when Janet gets rebooted mid-season one, did she forget everything that had happened in the previous episodes? I'm having a hard time recalling any proof in either direction. Obviously, the whole notion of Janet being ""all knowing"" is fuzzy. Like Michael, she seems aware of everything about all four humans while they were alive, yet she needs to be told Jason isn't actually Jianyu. (Which--since Jianyu wasn't a real person, where is her information on *his* life coming from? Actually, since Janet ""knew"" both Jianyu's and ""Good Eleanor's"" favorite meals in s1, she seems to have fake knowledge alongside all her *real* knowledge without...knowing it.)

Also, remember how long it took Janet to remember her ABJanets? She doesn't seem to have that problem this season. Is that a kink that gets worked out the more she gets rebooted, or are there long gaps between Michael snapping his fingers and welcoming the characters to another attempt?

The twist was phenomenal, but theres one thing that's bothering me. *Why does the medium place exist?* 

If I'm understanding the lore correctly, there is no actual Good Place - it is merely Michael's twist of the traditional Bad Place, using humans to torture eachother. 

Nevertheless, the Medium Place is said to exist because the placement of Mindy could not be decided between the ""Good Place"" and the Bad Place.

Therefore, if the Good Place doesn't actually exist, how come the Medium Place exists? Because she keeps her memory, what is she? Also an actor? A human left there to be tortured by mediocrity? What's the point?",4,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

After watching Parks and Rec, it quickly became my all-time favorite show before even finishing it.  Then I began The Office, which I also love dearly, but Michael Schur's double-duty as a writer and Dwight's cousin Mose began to really solidify my admiration for the man.  And the Good Place began to take it up a notch even before the big reveal.  I mean, this man created a show about government that didn't get overtly political, and now a show about the afterlife where I'm not being talked down to about religion.  Any lesser showrunner would have royally forked both of those concepts up.   (Side note: Sadly, I have yet to begin Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  Didn't realize it was Schur until after I began TGP, but now it's definitely high priority on my list.)

Anyway, I've been curious since the beginning of the Good Place.  Which of the Pawnee Parks Department would have ended up where?  And for the sake of discussion, the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin?  The NYPD of B99?

Maybe the whole thing stopped at the first loop, and Micheal is now in his own personal hell, trying to roll that rock up the hill, only to have to start over, again and again, and again.

He annoyed the hell out of everyone when he proposed The Neighbourhood, and if the standard on success is so high that there's no wriggle room... Who's to say he wasn't caught on Loop Two and got himself reset?

So we know that Chidi speaks French, as he states in S1E1. However, we also know that he speaks absolutely perfect, unaccented English, as shown when he is working as a philosophy professor in Sydney. Despite this, he chooses to speak French in The Good Place, and presumably in all permutations thereof. Does he choose this because it his native tongue, or is it predetermined by the good place?

Similarly, we know that Tahani was born in Pakistan. This means that she may speak both Urdu and English, both the national languages of Pakistan, and as her parents are presumably from Pakistan, Urdu may even have been her first language (though she was schooled in London). Do we know if she actually speaks English or Urdu in the Good Place? Moreover, if she is speaking Urdu, does the Good Place simply know how to translate that into British English, accent and all?

Maybe I'm the only one wondering about this, and maybe I'm way overthinking it, but I wanted to see what others thought! ",12,9,False,spoiler,,,,,
