The possibility they're apparently not being constantly big brothered gives them breathing room to fight back.

One of the most popular debates in moral philosophy is: do good intentions make you good (Kantian morality), or do good results make you good (consequentialist morality)? This dilemma is personified perfectly with Tahani and Chidi. Chidi has excellent intentions but few good deeds, and Tahani has excellent deeds but poor intentions. We know now that both of them ended up in the bad place. Not only that, but Chidi was actually the closest to making it to the good place, so presumably intentions are more important than results. 

This throws a huge wrench in the point system. The moral system presented in the first episode is heavily skewed toward consequentialism. We see many examples of what gains and loses you points, all based on actions taken, i.e. hug a friend, tell a woman to smile. It doesn't appear to matter why you hugged the friend -- there's an objective point value attached to the action with multipliers applied for how many times you did it. That Tahani could be disqualified just for bad intentions even though she had an incredibly positive effect on the world would suggest that the entire point system we have seen so far is fake. All the times that we saw people's point totals were lies designed to manipulate them, as Michael hinted at when he mentioned letting Tahani see the scoreboard early on. This explains why the system suddenly skewed toward Kantian in What's My Motivation when Eleanor's intentions for doing good suddenly matter: all the better to torture her.

So if the points we've seen are fake, what was the real system used to judge the main four? We know that there is a real good place and bad place since Michael mentioned them in the flashback, and that the real top scorer of the four was Chidi, the best intentioned of them. But we have no idea what the actual rules are, just that they probably aren't as simple as we thought. Meaning we now get to explore morality even further as we watch the main characters rebel against a corrupt system.",7,22,False,self,,,,,

Michael created the place for these people to torture each other indefinitely. But is he the bad guy?

I believe Michael is still a good guy, ultimately trying to help these poor humans. Here's some thoughts:

1) He stole a Janet from the real Good Place to enhance authenticity. But why do they need to be authentic? Eleanor and friends could be told that anything is ""the Good Place"" and they'd have to accept it. By planting a good Janet, Michael gave the occupants a heavenly tool. She's already proven that she can help them to escape (to some degree).

2) In his flashback, Michael appears much older than his co-workers. Age is meaningless for these demon workers (we can call them demons for now), but I think the fact that he looks so much older than others is that he started this work later. Theory: He was rebellious, questioning why we need to have a Bad Place at all. At some point he realized the best way to fix the system was to join it and quietly make the changes he wanted to see. 

3) Michael is under close surveillance of Shawn and the other board members. Every action needs to be approved, so it all needs to seem like it's hurting the humans. But Michael knows that humans tend to bond in the face of adversity. They work together best when they are humbled. Michael is the hero they need.

There's a lot of possibility here, and I'm so glad Michael Schur is going this direction!

TLDR: Michael is pretending to be a bad dude, but really he's trying to help the humans. ",5,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tahani was sent to the bad place because even though she raised $60 billion for charity she did it to gain the love of her parents and upstage her sister, she did it for personal gain instead of doing it out of the goodness of her heart. So here's my question, if that's true then shouldn't most ""good"" people not get into the REAL good place? Many people don't do good things out of the goodness of their heart but in order to not go to hell a.k.a personal gain. 

Chidi was sent to the bad place, not because he did anything wrong but because he made his friends and family miserable by being so indecisive. But here's my problem, his indecisiveness was something he didn't choose to be , it was an unfortunate trait that he was born with, that he desperately wished to change about himself and they were punishing him for something he can't control. 

These would be my arguments as to why Chidi and Tahani should go to the REAL good place lmao

There does not seem to be any precedent or means for a typical happy ending where the characters end up in the Good Place. 

Maybe I'm overthinking it? Maybe a Good Place angel or something randomly ends up in the neighborhood (maybe to get their Janet back?) and takes a liking to the characters (of course, then we'd have to wonder if that was just part of Michael's plan).

I hope the premiere deals with the characters repeatedly reuniting and finding out the truth about Michael and them really being in the Bad Place and then having their memories reset over and over again. Essentially, every time they figure out what's truly going on they're immediately sent back to square one (and you could even continue to have Michael be tweaking small things in the background each time they're reset). 

Then at the end of the episode you could finally have Shawn refuse to let Michael continue resetting after his countless failures. Honestly, I have no idea where the show would even go from there (maybe have Michael being punished for his actions by being stuck in the ""Good Place"" and then over the course of the season he'll learn to actually be a better person through the other characters) but it would open up a number of possibilities and keep the show fresh by avoiding multiple episodes of things we've already seen (albeit slightly tweaked).",8,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

Elenor confesses to being the problem which is the first thing that messed up Michael's plan because it shows that Elenor is growing into a good person. He calls Trevor to come take her because she actually might belong in the good place. 

Now condensing a lot of what happens across episodes 7-9, Trevor shows up saying that Real Elenor is in the Bad Place instead of Fake Elenor and if she doesn't take the spot then he's going to keep this ""Good"" person. If Elenor would have gone right then, my guess is that she would have gotten enough points for non-selfishly taking someone's spot in hell that that train would have taken her to the actual Good Place. It was a test. Trevor even has a line somewhere explaining that Elenor would be much more happy where Trevor is from. When Trevor threatens to call the Judge, he's really saying ""I'm gonna call your boss. Your plan failed, accept it.""

Mindy St. Clair was the second test, Fake Elenor had always been asking for a Medium place and low and behold there is such a place with one person in it. Someone almost exactly like Elenor, who lived a terrible selfish life and riiiight up until the end when she decided to be a good person and got granted clemency for it. 

Elenor could have lived out the rest of eternity getting what she wanted, a Medium Place, but instead she acted unselfishly and took the dive back into what we now know is the Bad Place to save her friends.

Could those memories of her being a good person be real? Could Eleanor have a life altering event that eventually made her in to a good person, and if so is Michael erasing her memories so that he can have more people in the bad place? Remember, during the memories that Michael plays for her, we did see white hands. Sort of also explains why Eleanor actually started becoming good. If she was already on the way to being a good person when the shopping cart hit her, also where her memories cut off, then it's no surprise that she'd still try and be a better person instead of acting like Jason all the time.

""Eleanor,"" she writes. ""Find Chidi.""

Pretty vague if you ask me, though it serves the story's purpose and sets up action for next season just fine. My question is, what would you have written?

I figure a good season 2 plot would be for Eleanor to figure it out again halfway through the season, then Michael realizing his fate would have no choice to bargain with Eleanor.  The tables are turned and Michael is now tortured under this burden. As long as Eleanor and the gang publicly act as though they were greatly annoying each other, then Michael gives them extra perks.   But it becomes a game of chicken, Michael alternating between confessing or shutting up for self preservation.  So sometimes the five of them reluctantly work together as a team, other episodes they want to all kill each other.  

There are still many untouched areas left to explore.  We have no idea what a real bad place looks like, only that the evil designers went out of their way to make neighborhoods for them.  We also have no idea what a real good place looks like either, but it's possible the fake good place was modeled after a real one.  The middle place seems real enough, very likely it gets revisited.  And since Janet learns more each reboot she will likely fall in love again.

Really minor observation: Has anyone noticed that Janet's hair changes with every reboot? FirstJanet has her hair down in loose waves; after her ""murder,"" SecondJanet  the one who falls in love with Jason  wears her hair in a high ponytail. I watched to see if, after the entire Good Place reset, Janet would just revert to her first incarnation. But she looks like a slightly altered version of SecondJanet, with a slightly less severe updo. It's probably just a visual cue to indicate that it's a different Janet reboot, but I'm wondering if it could possibly indicate that she is closer in temperament and personality to SecondJanet  especially since we've discovered that Janet ""grows"" and ""learns"" with each iteration.

Aside from Eleanor's choice to be good/self-sacrificing, my suspicion is that Michael's theft of a ""Good Janet"" is part of the pivot his failure turns on, and will continue to turn on. Janet is the ONLY neutral source of information in the faux Good Place. She led Eleanor and Jason to Mindy St. Claire, effectively bringing them both beyond Michael's jurisdiction. Whether her ""ride or die"" protocol survived this reboot or not, it seems like we're being visually cued to expect that she won't just be the same Janet we met in episode 1.

Now, I'm not going to post any theory here. Instead I'm going to post some facts (where the selection process is obviously going to be biased (since I'm posting the ones I think are interesting)) about Michael, the religious figure. Then, it will be up to you to decide whether you think any of this might mean something (regarding what has happened or is yet to come), or if I'm just grasping after straws.

&amp;nbsp;

* Michael is the only angel explicitly refered to as an archangel by all Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) and their subsets.
* While Michael's specific role/actual identity/feats differ between the religions, all depict him as an **(arch)angel of mercy** and **the one who battles (and defeats) Satan/Lucifer** (the number of times varies however).

&amp;nbsp;

Since the most of the depictions of Michael are within Christianity, the majority of the remaining facts will be the views of its different branches.

* The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy have pretty similar views on Michael. Some of his roles here have been touched upon earlier (a military figure and a leader of the armies of heaven, as well as being the leader of the (arch)angels). The most interesting fact in light of this (so far wonderful) series would however in my view be this quote (copied from Wikipedia):

&gt; *""The second and third roles of Michael in Catholic teachings deal with death. In his second role, Michael is the angel of death, carrying the souls of all the deceased to heaven. In this role Michael descends at the hour of death,* ***and gives each soul the chance to redeem itself before passing; thus consternating the devil and his minions.*** *Catholic prayers often refer to this role of Michael. In his third role, he weighs souls in his perfectly balanced scales. For this reason, Michael is often depicted holding scales.""*

* Islam sort of agrees with this notion, saying that Michael is the one ""responsible for the rewards doled out to good persons in this life"".
* Most remaining branches of Christianity have either suggested/theorized (Protestantism (and its sub-branches)) or explicitly stated (Jehovah's Witnesses/Seventh-day Adventists) that **Michael is the heavenly form of Jesus (i.e. God)** (and that arch angel means the ""head of angels"" rather than head angel).
* The Mormons are the odd ones out here, and say that Michael is Adam.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally (and very unrelated):

* The [Mont-Saint-Michael](http://www.brittanytourism.com/var/crtbre/storage/images/media/images/decouvrir/emblematiques/baie-du-mont-saint-michel/baie-du-mt-st-michel/575658-1-fre-FR/baie-du-mt-st-michel_large_rwd.jpg) in Normandy, France, is almost certainly one of the coolest castles/monasteries in the world (I still hold [Neuschwanstein](http://i.imgur.com/FJnR2oH.jpg) one notch higher however).

&amp;nbsp;

Now if you for some reason have read all this way and have not watched season 1 (which asks the question; why are you even here? (finish the season and come back afterwards)), don't go into the comments. There is an extremely high probability that there will be spoilers.

But a guy that thinks an impressionist painting is art of Frank Caliendo, says pitbull changed the game when asked what music he likes while he's still trying to hide, AND has the wherewithal to keep silent, pretend to be a monk, and slyly get his room set up? No. You can't be nuclear levels of retarded and still have the sense for all those things. This is a person so stupid that he's asking if there's a 7/11 along the train tracks and doesn't understand how to have sex (either she has equipment or she doesn't). There's no way that guy thinks to pretend to be a monk. 


I know what this character is. I know he's *supposed* to be a loveable idiot that you all root for. But Eleanor was a snotty person that bullied people online. He's robbed (or attempted to rob) stores, he's tracked down someone's boat because he was embarrassed and blew it up, he's happy to send someone who really has become a good person to hell if it means that he, someone who doesn't give a shit, gets away with it for free. 


Why would I like this guy? Why would anyone? He's a legitimate criminal. He doesn't have any desire, at all, to improve. 


This is one of the best shows I've seen in ***years***, it's probably my favorite acting from Danson. He made me hate him INSTANTLY in the finale. But I've got such a hangup about Jason and I'm not sure how to let go of it. It's like I have this beautiful, fantastic meal in from of me, and in the center is a small, uncooked beet that's glued to the plate. So I can enjoy the meal, but I have to eat around the beet.

This is the first time a bad neighborhood was crafted like this so it's probably the first time a human has become good in the afterlife. We know points are real since Michael is working on stuff like that in his flashback, so was Eleanor's point counter sky rocketing a real thing? Did the real powers notice this? Are they questioning it? When will we meet them? 


Michael wants to torture them for one thousand years. Shawn calls six months. ***TIME STILL EXISTS THERE.*** That's huge, because what happens after one thousand years? Is that enough and they go to a medium place, do they go to the good place then? Why put a constraint on it? If time exists, but their state of being is eternal, where will they go after the experiment ends (if it worked this time)? If they DO get to move to a good place afterwards, that means eventually you're released from torture. If eventually you're released from torture, does Eleanor becoming better get her an early release? Does Chidi helping get him one? Tahani?

Both Tahani and Eleanor have told Chidi that they love him but maybe not in THAT way. Chidi of course hasn't made any decisions on who he loves. I really like Chidi but I can't see him as a serious romantic partner for either Tahani or Elanor. I see him as the one
who ties everyone together.
     Tahani and Eleanor are seriously cute together. It really starts after they bond over watching Tahani's show about unlikely friends and Eleanor giving her hair extensions. Eleanor starts to make comments about how hot Tahani is all the time. And of course Eleanor says she might be legit into the sexy skyscraper. I think it was the second episode when Eleanor was going off about the things she didnt like about Tahani and ended up getting turned on. And the way they ended the season with Eleanor being into Tahani makes me think that is going to be a part of season two.
     And I really hope Jason and Janet fall in love again! They are so perfect for eachother. They both have a kind of dogged and slightly ignorant way of going about things.

If we assume that Michael could still be lying and that the only truth we can state for certain are what occurs in the flashbacks, then the two ideas become possible:

A. Michael, and the show, gave off the impression that people remain in the Bad Place forever when talking to Eleanor, Chidi, Tahini, and/or Jason. But when talking to the other demons, only the first possible 1000 years of torture are mentioned. What if the Bad Place is only temporary and eventually those who reside there are able to redeem themselves and earn a spot within the Good Place?

B. The possibility that Michael is even further lying by agreeing with Eleanor that they are in the Bad Place. They might be somewhere else, but Michael finds it easier/better to just agree to Eleanor that then reveal where they truly might be (possibly some Limbo?). 

To me these explainations would make more sense as to why they picked the four that are chosen to live together. Yes they are designed to be able to torture each other, but the Fake Good Place didn't seem too terrible and all four of them were slowly becoming better people as the season progressed. This explaination would explain that they were chosen to suffer together because everyone's interactions with each other would slowly turn them into better people.",12,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

There were a few correct elements.

I have a new theory moving forward. 

Michael isn't evil. 

One thing we know almost nothing about right now is the Good Place and the hierarchy of the afterlife. Michael has been an apprentice for who knows how long. When he's finally given a chance to create his own neighborhood he creates The Good Place. Why? As Shawn said ""All this trouble for four people?"" 

It is my theory that Michael is actually from the Good Place or some sort of management tier above either place. He infiltrated the Bad Place because he aims to prove that the current system is unjust. Too many people sentenced to the Bad Place are still worthy of being saved. We all believed it must be the good place because Tahani and Chidi were so certainly good. 

There is a spectrum of people being tortured for eternity and some of them are decent folks.

Meanwhile you have the Good Place. What kind of people are there? In the first episode where Michael is telling Eleanor about all the people in the bad place she realizes that it's unjust for so many of them to be there. If the Good Place is full of people who go on hunger strikes and relief missions to the Sudan, there's no way they would be accepting that someone gets spiders poured in their eyes forever because they stuck gum in public places 226 times. 

Someone would try to change it, and sometimes you have to prove something's worth changing before anyone notices there's a problem.

As I am stuck in bed with fibro and using this show and research as a distraction from pain, I may have seen and had the ability to find more easter eggs than you guys. I don't want to be the big kid who gets all of the eggs. Ethically, I think I need to allow you guys to have the fantastic ah-ha from this one.

Things like Michael telling the towns people they couldn't leave their house seconds after Chidi decided to move back to his house (Ep5 Category 55...). I'm so used to shows where things just ""happen"" to fall into place, but The Good Place utilizes all these moments.
