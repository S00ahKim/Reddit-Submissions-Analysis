Every time the show seems like it's getting to a format (if that's the right word) that it will stick to, some event happens and it changes. At the start of season two, we get to the format of the humans being tortured unwittingly, but that changes in the second episode when Michael's allegiances change. Then, it gets to a format of team cockroach getting put through torture by three hundred eighteen demons while they gameplan to get to the real good place. But this format gets disrupted when Shawn (/Shaun/Sean) shows up. 

Then mayhem (not a format) ensues until Michael and the judge plan to retest them on earth. This format sticks for a few episodes until the gang walks in on Michael and Janet. Then, the format of the Soul Squad trying to help others happens for a few episodes until this is disrupted by the demons traveling to earth. Then, more mayhem happens until this current format of the new neighborhood test. 

This general thing is analogous to Hegel's idea of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. A format occurs (thesis) until it is changed by a big event (antithesis) and mayhem occurs until it dwells to a new format (synthesis).

Using this line alone I have the following theory:

Following with tradition of past seasons, the plan gets shaken up within a couple episodes. However, The Judge ultimately decides that the general idea: That you can put a small group of people together in a posh environment together and they will get better, works. The current point system is flawed, and so it is replaced with a new one. What will it be? I believe it will look something like this:

1. Take a small group (3-8) of people who lived relatively medium lives and put them in a relatively posh place.

2. If the architect is present, they will only be there briefly. They might take an active role, but this is unlikely. Maybe if they're new, like Michael was (so that they, like Michael, can learn more about humanity).

3. If Janet is present, she will be behind the scenes managing the background characters. She will not always give into the requests of the subjects, and if she does, the subject's requests will be met in an indirect fashion. For example, if someone wants a new car, an ad for the car may suddenly pop up on the television.

4. As is tradition, hurdles and wacky situations will be thrown at the subjects. Perhaps these will come from The Bad Place, or the Architect, or Janet.

5. Near the end of the run, the subjects' point totals will be re-calculated and all that to determine whether they go to The Good Place or The Bad Place. Perhaps (just spit-balling here) the points will instead be calculated by an ""audience"" of Immortal Beings. Perhaps they are kept in the Neighborhood until they become good enough to be placed in The Good Place.

6. So, what's the ""cameo of all cameos""? According to Jameela (same video mentioned prior) the cameo ""exists within the NBC family"". I predict one of two cameos: The cast of Cheers, or the cast of Friends.

7. The takeaway? Every single sitcom involving a group of friends that you've ever watched, be it Friends, How I Met Your Mother, or Parks and Rec, is an afterlife. The ""experiment"" goes on in the hopes that the characters grow to become better people, and achieve the goal of going to The Good Place.",10,38,False,self,,,,,

So in these scenes where the Bad Place demons are choosing the new bad people for the experiment, Glen is very obviously out of place among the other demons.

He is particularly uncomfortable with the Bad Place choosing people who with whom they are set up to fail; he considers it cheating, which he takes issue with.

Otherwise what was the point of that final scene?

I have a Theory Journal where I write down theories for different shows (sometimes movies) I watch.

Anyway I messed up and did not label Season 4 of The Good Place.

I have a theory that came to me at the end of watching the premiere for the season and after this episode I am MORE convinced. I mean, we all know there's another big classic Mike Schur twist coming, yah? 

At the end of 4.01, there's that really weird end shot of Janet walking off the shirtless demon off screen and then kind of weirdly walking back into frame a few moments later while Bad Janet arguably distracts Michael and Eleanor with some teasing. I thought, that's weird, it's a 20 minute show essentially, things are cut very deliberately, seems like an odd moment to waste on a wrap up that could've been thrown into dialogue, this framing feels weird. But it also felt deliberate in the way it was weird, like we the audience were being distracted too.

Then in 4.02, it opens with Eleanor saying ""it was so obvious"" what they did with the old lady and implying it was not that simple. THEN, later in the episode, it kind of seems like Janet instigates some in-fighting, probably planting the thought into Tahani, who then suggests it to Jason, that Eleanor wasn't a good leader, which of course set off her chain wallowing and stress and questioning herself. Remember that originally these four were chosen to inadvertently torture each other. 

THEN Janet breaks up with Jason and, arguably more devastatingly for him, also tells him about Blake Bortles getting cut. Why? It's almost like she's deliberately torturing him. OH WAIT, OH DANG

i.e. the real plan of the demons was to put in a bad and/or demon Janet to torture them from within and make them mess up. And it's already started. Not to mention her voice has dropped like an octave. Coincidence!! I think not!! 

(theoretically I also think it was also the plan to get Chidi back into the experiment to also torture Eleanor via falling in love with Simone but that's tangential)

I think that all the demons and whatever are in the good place are former humans, who are tested in their own personal hell and see if they can become a better person when having their mind set being the absolute worst possible. 

So theres also a theory that the cockroaches through reboots retained some basic info similar to how Janet evolved through her many reboots. 


My theory is that Michael was a relatively decent person during his time on earth, but the actual food and bad places were not sure where to place him, similar to mindy. 

Michael has his memories wiped and he was given a personality and they are testing him to see if he can work through all these terrible markers of his supposed true self and become a better person, like he did with the cockroaches. 

I believe that Michael was probably a kind and loving father, and the humans are reflections of his own children, or people he cared about in his time on earth and he had to go against his nature (or the one that he was told is his nature) and help rescue them.

Michael is not a demon, but an entity created by the Judge to solve the faulty point system. 
He, unlike other demons, really likes humans, talks a lot about being one and really seems to love everyday human moments, wants to try it himself. Not to talk about his extremely original plan for the bad place.
The Jugde herself, as shown, has the ability to travel to earth without the key or door, so she must have let Micheal and Janet escape on purpose.
She says she doesn't want to interfere in human afairs, but binge watching shows should have thought her many things about earth and people. So she probably understands, that points are too hard to earn these days. (anyways, I think she knows everything in the universe just like Janet).
She also made a montage with the four humans. I think it's just a ""checkpoint"" in her mission, because they are pretty important in her plan.

Last night after finishing A Girl From Arizona, I'm just tickled by how well this story fits into a larger structure and the Hero's Journey.  I saw it before last night, but as Eleanor needed Michael to Obi-wan her for her to rise to the occasion and face her biggest hurdle, I finally decided to post nonsense about it.  

If you consider S1 = Act 1, Season 2 &amp; 3 = Act 2 (which for non-writers and uninformed, Act 2 is half of your movie/story), and this final season is the 3rd Act ending they have worked towards.  Key points in this journey include Eleanor admitting to being a fraud as the inciting incident, halfway through Act 1, Michael joining forces with the soul squad and shaping their goal at the beginning of S2 acts as an end to the first Act, and getting to Earth at the end of S2 is a perfect midpoint in their journeys.

But as Eleanor got her heart to heart pep-talk from ~~Obi-wan~~ Michael at the end of the 2-part season premiere, her lowest point, it absolutely felt like our story is heading into its climax as our heroine rises to the occasion and overcomes her biggest obstacles.

5. Neighborhood can be adjusted.

1. Micheal designed a new neighborhood
2. Bad place choose to have the same 4 human subjects fooling the original 4 humans into thinking they are not the subjects. Having the same 4 subjects meets the 'similar level of badness' criteria.
3. No reboots tricks the humans into thinking 'no second attempts'.

4. Micheal gets 5 minutes of prep time. It doesn't specify when he has to use this prep time. He uses his prep time whenever he think the humans are in need of his help and swaps places with fake Micheal.

Is definitely one of, if not the, best TV show in my opinion. However, there are some things in the show that just don't add up. The main one being our beloved Jeremy Bearimy. Now although I understand that Jeremy Bearimy is a cheap plot device to make Michael going back in time to save the humans make sense, it still doesn't change the fact that it literally breaks the entire forking show. Here is how.

As it was used in the show, Jeremy Bearimy was used to go back in earth time. However, this also means that it could, logically, be used to go forward in earth time. Therefore, any time Michael made reference to something not having yet happened is complete bologna since everything has already happened, is already happening, and will happen at the same time since the timelines of the afterlife and the earth timeline are not synced. An example of this is when Michael told Jason that he cannot predict the future, but the Jacksonville Jaguars will never win the Super Bowl. This also leads to another big problem with Jeremy Bearimy. If there is no sync between time in the afterlife and time in the real world, and time in the afterlife is circular, then every reference to time made in the show is bullshirt because time is a loop in the afterlife and it would be impossible to gauge time. This leads me to the biggest problem with Jeremy Bearimy. If there is no sync between time in the afterlife and time in the real world, and everything has already happened, is already happening, and will happen at the same time, then everybody who will ever been born has already died. Therefore. there is no need for accounting, and there is really no need for the system at all because everything in the afterlife has been going on forever and everything is pointless.

To conclude, The show made a big mistake with Jeremy Bearimy. They should have used a plot device like ""The realm of the doorman is time neutral and can take you through to any year, but you need approval from the judge to get there"" or something like that. Overall I try to ignore the gaping holes in the show, but is is hard. Anyways, I hope they have a good last season, and wrap up the show nicely. Thanks for reading

It can also be said that the subjects do feel tortured.

**Chidi:** His soulmate literally doesn't think he exists. He is being pushed to teach the other subjects about ethics, even though they don't care. He may also face a dilemma if he realizes that he may have feelings for Elanor and she has feelings for him. Like in season one, he would feel conflicted that his soulmate may be someone else.

**Simone:** Her whole philosophy is being challenged. She thinks she has a total understanding of reality, but the longer she stays, she will start feeling doubts.

I am rewatching Janet(s) right now and just went through the accountant explaining the point system.

He said that when an action is done by a person for the first time, it gets sent to relevant departments, who evaluates the action based on motivations, effect it has on others, etc, which is verified by 3 million other accountants, and agreed upon. Then, any time the action is repeated, it's assigned the same amount of points.

So what if when an good action was done for the first time, it was done with malignant intentions? Anyone who performs it later, even with different motivations, could end up getting that amount of points.

In S2, when Janet realizes that the resets have made her more intelligent, she says, ""I might be the most sophisticated Janet in existence!"" The word that stuck out to me here is *might*. It's odd to me that Janet is uncertain about this - she's supposed to be know everything, but is unaware whether there is another Janet who's been reset so many times.

It's also established that Janet becomes more powerful with each reset. This is why she's able to pretend to be a Bad Janet, and also why she's able to *create forking life!!* (Emphasis on ""forking,"" as that was the purpose.)

Therefore....... the possibility has been left open for another Janet far far *far* more powerful than our Janet. Ours was only reset 800+ times, after all. (Derek was reset many more than this, but he is also brain damaged since birth, so there's that.)

We still have no confirmation as to whether Gen is the ultimate being in the universe. What if the Ultimate Being is a Janet? A God-Janet, capable of anything? Heck, with Jeremy Bearimy, it isn't even relevant that Janets are created in a warehouse.

It would also be a nice way of raising the stakes without having to introduce a whole new character for us to get used to in just 20 minutes - it would instead be another variation on Janet, which could potentially be more satisfying if they were introduce an Ultimate Being at some point.",8,18,False,self,,,,,

My theory is he knows that he will cave into Simone and ruin the experiment, meaning all of humanity is doomed to eternal life in The Bad Place. But I think Chidi saw that if he were to reboot his memory and forget about Eleanor and Simone, that there is a strong chance he can end up back with Eleanor. I mean look they always found their way to each other after 300 years and over 800 reboots with Michael as well as finding each other in the real world.  The catch is he cant tell her about it in order for them to reunite, sort of like how Dr. Strange couldnt tell Iron Man what path to take to defeat Thanos.

What we know so far.:.

-Eleanor died and became she lived selfish life, she went to some place which seems like hell aka bad place.
-Michael, (St. Michael?) just out of nowhere, started to like humans and especialy Eleanor, because reasons.
-Demons are meant to be evil, they do not have feelings, empathy, they just torture people because that is only thing that makes them happy, they love cursing, lie, deceive, hate, they are full of hate.
-Michael, one of those things, started to change and became good...because...why? Eleanor? They were plenty of humans he came in contact -with and he never had any inclination to become good. Very unlikely.

Why I only focused on Michael and Eleanor?
- because I think that every single person is FAKE and created by Janet customized for Eleanors afterlife...

I mean..
Chidi, is a moral compas, guy that she would never even talk to during her life, he is everything she hated about boys. 
Tahani - her role model maybe? Beauty, she is everything she Eleanor never become, smart, hot(from eleanor view), famous..etc...
Jason - is basically Eleanor, if you cut the dumb part...I mean Eleanors life was mess, Jason caused mess by molotov coctails, they are not so much different if you think about it.

I think this is her big test to redeem her soul, or go to bad place being tortured for eternity.

What happened -
-She turned herself in when place was collapsing because she did not belong. - sacrififed herself for Chidi because of his moral compas and stomachache of course - thing she would never do in her life - part 1 - chidi tried to change her point of view by philosophy and it worked passing the first trial.
- she refused to stay in medium place where she  could live medium...kinda not bad not good life...she came back for her friends. Passed second test.
- she sacrificed herself by allowing Chidi to remove his mind, basically giving farewell to her love of her ""life"" for the greater good - fixing point system
- in last episode she said, she could not control her own life, and somehow now is responsible for all lives in the world, doubting herself, where Michael came and gave her speech about her big heart# motivating her to finish her final test giving us the idea that anytime there was any big decisioning, it was Eleanor making decisions, or Michael pushing Eleanor to do so...

I think there are million situation when  eleanor did something for greater good, but just this comes after my mind after watching new episodes. I mean, even the new episodes are about Eleanor and Micharl putting everybody else completely out of sights...I mean, its wrap time, they need to focus on important things and characters to show us big ending..

-TLDR everybody is fake, michael is st michael testing eleanor if she belongs to bad or good place, I mean, thats what bible teaches us...everybody has a chance to redeem his soul, if the person is willing to do so...and thats what happenning.

Popular ones have been they get to the Good Place or end up in a new type of Medium Place.  I've read some interviews from the creator of the show and some of the actors, and while they don't reveal anything about how it ends in any detail, given the content of the show I have pieced together what I think will happen.

So in Season 3, the gang is sent back to Earth to see if their improvement in the afterlife translates to gains back on Earth.  The results are mixed as we saw, but it was notable that there did appear to be some transference of the improvements to their 2nd chance Earth selfs.  This is the whole reason we have the Season 4 experiment.

So one interesting thing the creator of the show has mentioned in interviews is he wants audiences to take away from the show that how we interact with people/treat people in life matters and at least trying to be good is better than not trying at all.  Tahani's actress has also mentioned the ending is ""devastating, but good"" to paraphrase.

So putting all this together, this is what I think happens:  I don't think they go to the Good, Bad, or even Medium place.  After the experiment ends, the conclusion that is reached is that improvement in the after life can translate to improvements on Earth.  So rather than everyone who dies going to the Good or Bad place, they create an adjustment to the system:  The super bad and super good people go to the respective places.  Everyone else goes to a ""Soul Rehab"" (run by Micheal/Janet) where they try to get them to improve.  After the ""rehab"" period is up, then they are reincarnated on Earth as different people (even if the soul is the same) and have to try again to see if they can do better this time.  The point system is also retooled so you get a cumulative total, the idea being that you can gradually gain (or lose) points to land you in the Bad or Good Place eventually.

I think the ""devastating"" part will be Team Cockroach has to get reincarnated as well, but because they helped make the change, they get the bonus perk of being able to pick their reincarnation parents.  Jason would probably pick Blake Bortles, Tahani would probably pick her sister, and Eleanor and Chidi would probably pick something where they grow up as neighbors or whatever.  Then all 4 reconnect later (when they are grown up maybe) and feel some unexplained connection to each other, but we see that they have all improved as people.  Or Eleanor and Chidi decide to stay in Soul Rehab to help others.",3,36,False,spoiler,,,,,

Tahani wants to create a Good Place where she is the demagogue of the world's most fashionable and elite, while still keeping them humble. 

Chidi dreams of running a Good Place where every action a person made on Earth can be explained with philosophy. His pursuit is absolute moral truth.

Then Eleanor asks if she can be the architect of a Bad Place. She is convinced that all humans need is that push in the right direction, plus maybe she loves forking with people a little. I realize this theory puts Chidi and Eleanor on separate planes of existence and not together. But perhaps they work closely together as he has taught her enough to be a philosopher in her own right, and sends him souls once they have accumulated enough points posthumously to be eligible for the Good Place.

Has it ever been tasked with rehabilitation?  On evidence, the bad place exists solely as a place of punishment.

It appears Michael began to question the fairness of this, why punish people if it's impossible for them to earn a kinder fate? If Michael has changed, then surely so can humans if they're influenced to do better.  But why does Michael care? Has he just become a better being when his whole eternal purpose was to torture humans, which he gleefully enjoyed doing so?  

On the surface, it seems so but does karma ever care about redemption? If person A was a scumbag but has a change of heart and vows to live better - and in fact does so, is A let off the hook for earlier wrongdoings?  Is the punishment lessened in the mind of A for he knows he once deserved his fate, or is it made worse for realising that though he once deserved punishment 10/20 years ago, the change is his being makes it now unfair?

I am wondering if Michael has played a very long con.  When he was given the chance, he came up with a creative way to torture - Hell is other people - but found that his selection of 4 kept on figuring out the jig. What if rather than battling for ambiguity, he leant into it, and helped the humans become better so that their futile efforts to avoid punishment becomes all the more tortuous?

Examples:

The Michael suit making people suspect everyone of being a fraud.

The theme of fake realities/people/identities. Is the whole system just a test? Was Earth a simulation? Are they still in TBP? Who knows?

Anytime Michael does or says anything and it's hard to tell if he really means it or if he's just messing with people for his own reasons.

It was all a dream

Think about it, Eleanor starts the show by doing what? Opening her eyes, and you know when else someone opens their eyes? When they wake up. Shes seen doing this what, twice, meaning she opened her eyes at the start in her dream, and must have opened her eyes to wake up in the season two episodes, but then like midway through season two into three when the shirt hits the fan, her eyes are closed again. In reality shes in a coma after her near death experience.

336,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2019-10-10,2019,10,10,6,dfnzsh,self.TheGoodPlace,(Season Four) Theory - Michael represents archangel Michael,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/dfnzsh/season_four_theory_michael_represents_archangel/,Vntus,1570657660,"I've had this theory for a long time now but never posted it until I saw u/EwanG comment on the post ""Good Place Theory - Michael is actually God"", you can find his comment here https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/dfii7c/good_place_theory_michael_is_actually_god/f33rrry/

Seeing that someone else had a similar theory encouraged me to post this so credits to him. Unlike him however I don't believe that Michael is actually the archangel Michael as he is known in Abrahamic religions, however, I believe he is meant to be a representation of him and that their stories will follow very similar paths. I will admit that this theory only started because of the name choice but I think with the creators of this show the name choice has to have been deliberate and the more I read about archangel Michael the more I believe this theory. 

In the Old Testament Michael is known as the protector of Israel and as we can very well see in the show Michael does take on the role of a protector to the soul squad by saving them from the bad place, but also most recently Michael is really acting as the protector to all of humanity. It also says in the Old Testament that Michael will arise during the ""time of the end"" and given the current circumstances in the show if the experiment succeeds there is no doubt that drastic changes will occur meaning this is potentially a very significant turning point in humanity and the afterlife and is the end of an era.

In the Book of Revelation there is a war in heaven between the armies of God and  Satan and this seems to be analogous of the current 'battle' between Michael and the soul squad and the bad place demons. (Here is where my predictions for the future of this show start.) In the Book of Revelation this war in heaven ends with Michael defeating Satan, which I think means that Shawn represents Satan and Michael defeats him in that the experiment will be successful. Furthermore after archangel Michael defeats Satan he sends him and his followers to Earth, which I think is very likely to occur in The Good Place, with the demons being sent to Earth so that they can learn what its like to be human and become more empathetic, in the same way that Michael and The Judge did. (Sidenote: Satan still tries to wreak havoc while on earth and I think it's possible that Shawn might never learn to be better and do the same.) 

Finally, and here is where things get interesting archangel Michael is often associated with the second coming of Christ and I think what this means for The Good place is that Eleanor will be the one to represent Christ and she becomes the new judge or even god if they decide to go that route. Obviously, this part is a lot of speculation but I think it will be something in this vein, it could be that Professor ethics himself Chidi is the one to become the new judge or perhaps it is not really a second coming of Christ but the soul squad is tasked with developing the new point system.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

But after watching S4E2 I can only think that the whole stream of events so far is making this a medium place with the chance to prove yourself to get into the real good place and a place where everyone who has ever died passes through.

Everyone gets the route to get into the good place. Some get there quickly and it takes others thousands of years. But overall everyone goes through this process of finding themselves and growing as people.

Overall everything that has been learnt forces people into test after test until they are truly ready for the good place.

The storyline of everyone that has died is the same, they think they're in the good place and find out it not to be, find out everyone goes to the bad place and then tries to fix it.

All 4 are together on their path to salvation which is earnt, not in their lives, but in the medium place, but the character they are in their life makes the path easier as they do the right thing quicker.

It would tie everything up nicely, everyone goes to the good place eventually, Michael isn't really a demon but a guide to smooth edges, everyone else are acting in the good place's best interests making sure that all are ready and no one ends up in eternal torment once you have completed your journey.

My final guess is that Eleanor takes up the architect role for real in the end for the next 4 people, helping them on their path to the good place.",11,14,False,self,,,,,

When Michael is telling Eleanor about how she beat him more than 800 times, and then said that you try and try again, because maybe the 1001st idea might work made me think about this theory.

So what if, this is Michael's 1001st idea, and is how he is torturing the original 4. Throughout the episode it is seen that Tahani is made to feel bad about doubting Eleanor. Eleanor feels like a failure. Jason got emotionally crushed by learning about Blake Bortles and Janet breaking up with him. Chidi is learning about soulmates, and is set up for eventual pain if he dates Simone, when he learns about him and Eleanor once dating.

Do not read if you havent watched the full show to date.








Michael and Janet have been replaced with bad Janet and Vicky.

Janet broke up with Jason and told him bortles was cut from the team, as far as we know (provided she hasnt been rebooted 800 times) bad Janet cannot pretend to be good so she uses her excuse of stress to cover up her nastiness - there was no need to rub salt in the wound right after breaking up with him. If this is true then of course she would be stressed! Bad Janet has never worked a day in her life.

She poorly handles the situation with Eleanor by using statistics to once again be outright nasty. 

Now for Michael. We recently got a preview clip of the new episode and Michael is joking about chidis memories being erased. He hated having to do that and it killed him. He then covers it up with a sarcastic its sort of sad for you to Eleanor.

Not only this, but we see chidi finally getting a break and what does Michael do?? He OUTRIGHT says that the problem is that chidi isnt being tortured. He is literally suggesting to torture chidi! He is also wearing a black bow tie which he never ever does - Vicky made fun of his bow ties in s2. She knows she cant put a regular old tie on the skin suit of Michael but she cant bear to wear something ridiculous so she puts a black one on.

Now, for the first episode. The demon granny has mentioned in season 2 AND in season 4 that he isnt a good actor. The bad place wouldnt put someone in deliberately that they knew was a bad actor - the demon granny was a huge red herring to disguise the real foul play - Vicky. And guess what she conveniently wants? A big acting role.

Now, heres the real kicker. 

They never left the bad place.

All the new humans are just another way to torture the original four. I reckon (it pains me to say this) that in season two Michael tried something new. Why not come clean he thinks. I can gain their trust and pretend to improve all while torturing them behind the scenes okay, so he does.

and what happens? He sends them back to earth to watch them be miserable with the soul squad and the undercover demon. They go on these long winded journeys to improve the people around them even though its painful - especially for Eleanor! Allll just to find out that The system is forked. All their work was for essentially nothing.

So they go to the accounting office and they get this long winded spiel about how there isnt anything that can be done. So they escape to the good place and set up a meeting with these overbearingly nice people who cant get a single forking thing done because theyre so nice theyre practically incompetent of doing anything - all while being two Oreo cookies away from heaven

So blah blah blah and they end up doing the experiment.

Eleanor is being tortured because everything she does blows up in her face - nothing she does works. She has to run everyones lives while also watching the love of her life fall in love with someone else.

Jason is being tortured because derek keeps annoying him trying to win over janet, and the whole breakup and Blake bortles thing.

Tahani is being tortured because none of her points are being taken seriously and she keeps trying to warn the gang about her suspicions and even when shes right they just ignore her.

Chidi I assume will be tortured soon but just having to try and teach Brent ethics is torture enough - let alone being so painfully unaware of everything because of his lack of memories.

Hell - even Mindy is being tortured because she cant even use her own damn house. 

So yeah. This is the bad place.",12,17,False,spoiler,,,,,

Michael and Janet were indeed switched out with a demon and Bad Janet in S4E1. Shawn is the demon in the Michael suit. The person at the end is Michael, kind of. There is no TL:DR but the important stuff is all in the last paragraph.

1: Everyone is miserable. To the point that Chidi almost had a holy motherforking shirtballs moment. Theyre torturing each other again, pretty obviously.

2: Every time the Brainy Bunch is close to a breaking point Michael and Janet point them in the right direction to ease their pain slightly. Eleanor even says it directly when she says Im doing better but still terrible. Janet gave Tahani horrible advice for helping John to start, then the right advice later when she was about to give up. Michaels speech to Eleanor on the couch in episode 2 was the same thing. Michael and Janet are smart enough to back off because Shawn is in the Michael suit.

3: Janets hair change is Bad Janet leaking through

4: the person at the end isnt going to be some new big bad guy. The writers wouldnt introduce a new concept like that at the end of the show. And they are clearly coming from The Bad Place, most likely escaping since theyre riding that cart thing.

The being at the end is Michael. The real question is, what form is Michael in? He could be his usual self, Michael in Shawns skin suit, or a demon like weve seen before with Todd.

Heres the big theory. Were at the point where its all set up, a twist is coming at some point. The being at the end is Michael, but not as weve seen before. Its his true form but Michael is no longer a demon. Hes an angel or something between an angel and a demon. In The Good Place: The Podcast there was a subtle line that referenced the test lasting for the first two episodes. Michael returning no longer being a demon is what puts an end to the test.

1. **Olenna Redwyne, Queen of Thorns**Eleanor once compared Tahani to Maggie Smith from Downton Abbey who was the fan favorite to play Olenna before Diana Rigg was cast. (This was during their downtime in Gens chambers after their tests to get into the Good Place.)

2. **Margaery Tyrell**Maggie Smith was Tahanis godmother, just as the Queen of Thorns was Margaerys grandmother. And Tahani shares many personality traits with Margaery, who also used her philanthropy to improve her social position. As she confessed to the High Sparrow, her motivations were corrupt. She was charitable not because she really cared about the smallfolk, but because it improved her reputation and that of House Tyrell. (Of course she was telling the High Sparrow what he wanted to hear, but I think its a bit of both. Margaerys a complex character who never does things for only one reason.)

3. **Sansa Stark**especially early Sansa, who was a social climber and snob, obsessed with the culture and elitism of the South. Never satisfied with what she had, she always wanted more. And she loved to be praised and pettedby her mother, her septa, her friend Jeyne Poole. Everyone is always calling Sansa beautiful, from Tyrion praising her long neck, to Cersei calling her Little Dove, and the Hound the Little Bird. Sansa is good at everything she does, she is the perfect ideal of femininity in the medieval world. Tahani loves to be called beautiful and perfect, she was Baz Luhrmanns muse. Mostly she just stood around while he threw glitter on her. And her name means Congratulations Beautiful. Shes also good at everything she does. I would say I outdid myself, but Im always this good. So I simply did myself.

4. **Arya Stark**who had an inferiority complex when compared to her perfect sister. She knew she could never be as good a lady as her sister, which became her prime motivator in becoming something else. She constructed her whole identity in relation to her sister, becoming the anti-Sansa, even going so far as to name her iconic weapon, Needle, for Sansas embroidery needles. From Tahanis perspective, Kamilah was the Sansa to her Arya. She spent her whole life being jealous of perfect Kamilah, and hating being reduced to Kamilahs sister, just as Arya resented being called a lady, and told Gendry over and over again her mother and sister were ladies, but thats not her. It took a long time for Arya and Sansa to find each other again, and just like with Tahani and Kamilah, their reconciliation represented deep personal growth for both sisters.

5. **Cersei Lannister**Cersei spent her whole life trying to gain the approval of her father Tywin, who was always disappointed in her and dismissive of her accomplishments. Tahani unfortunately had a toxic relationship with both her parents, not just her father, but she had the same fruitless yearning for parental love which was at the heart of her many issues, and what ultimately made her fail her test to get into the Good Place.

6. **Myrcella Baratheon**A born princess, all she wanted was to marry her handsome Dornish prince. But she wanted Trystane to admit that he wanted her for her, and not because their families had arranged their match. How many other girls have you walked through these gardens? I like the way your eyes go squinty when youre jealous. They do not go squinty and you didnt answer the question. She was just a girl, ~~*towering over*~~ standing in front of a boy, asking him to admit he loves her. Myrcellas life was like a song, and Tahanis life, from the outside anyway, was a fairytale.

7. **Shireen Baratheon**the lonely little girl who had almost no friends and spent most of her life alone. This was the reality of Tahanis life. As we learned in this episode, even when she was invited to exclusive parties, and the VIP suite of those parties, and then the exclusive PIN-protected room of that VIP suitewhen she entered, she was alone. She spent her whole life longing for human connection, for real friends. Poor Shireen just wanted the same thing. She may have been a princess, and one of the many disputed heirs to the Iron Throne, but there are few characters in ASOIAF who had a sadder life.

8. **Daenerys Targaryen**After losing their parents, Tahani and Kamilah became orphans of a great noble family, just as Daenerys and Viserys were the last of the Targaryens. Dany in Qarth also had her Tahani moments, trying to civilize her Dothraki, telling them not to rob Xaro Xhoan Daxos estate and to behave like proper guests. She wore the Qartheen gowns and enjoyed living like a princess before someone took her dragons, anyway. I could see Tahani living it up in the Great Pyramid, ruling as Queen of Meereen. That seems like a natural fit for her.

1) the whole encouraging tahani to use physical violence, literally hanging her the boxing gloves
2) telling her to go and gossip and mention the whole GOT character thing. Tahani is in the bad place because shes narcissistic and shallow, why would Janet encourage that in her?
3) the whole just go and confront him stuff, I think Janet knew he would react poorly like he did the first time at confrontation and thats why she said do it again but be more direct! Expecting the same results, and it backfired on her when it actually worked.

I were gonna get another big twist but it wont be oh theyve always been in the bad place because thats so cheap and predictable. 

I have two main theories 

1) the four original humans are being tested still and THEYRE actually the subject, not the four new humans, so thats why Michael and Janet seem to be pushing them in bad ways.

2) I also think that its possible the four arent necessarily humans at all, theyre some judge or accountant like thing who, when realizing that the point system doesnt work, had their memories wiped and decided to live human lives to see exactly what its like and how to fix it, similar to what the judge did by going down to earth. They never get anyone to help them fix it because THEYRE the ones doing the fixing, so the good place and accounting put on this bumbling bullshit act to keep pushing them forward and let them figure it out themselves.

I came across a section that made me think of The Good Place:

 

&gt;In his Kenyon College commencement address, Wallace described the human condition as daily crises and chronic disillusionment and warned against succumbing to solipsism, invoking the existential values of compassion and mindfulness:  
&gt;  
&gt;""The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day.... The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're going to try to see it. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't.... The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness.""

Here's where I'm at so far:

Out of all the demons, who took to acting the most that we know of? Trevor and Vicky.

- If Michael was switched, I think he's Trevor. Why? Because Trevor was there when Michael struggled to make a bad joke so he'd know that would seem authentic after the switch. He also is very good at seeming genuine (like when he was on Earth) but actually sabotaging. If Michael wasn't switched, I think his panic attack was real and he's falling into old traps because it's comfortable and he's terrified.

- If Janet was switched, I think it was Vicky. Because she's shown she's down to try to act like anyone and ace it. She also was in the fight scene so we know she's not beneath physical violence like Janet suggested today. She also would walk away from Jason after torturing him in the worst way instead of comforting because that's a very lazy way of torturing Jason. I also think if Janet was switched she's still somewhere in the neighborhood because I don't think a Bad Janet could run a neighborhood that complex, but I could be wrong. If Janet wasn't switched, she's going through an identity crisis of some kind like Eleanor in S3. I think this would eventually risk the stability of the neighborhood.

- Who is the person at the end? Well they have some kind of male dress shoe that the demons wear. It's also a taller person. My money is still on Glen backstabbing the bad place and outting the spies next episode. But it could be Michael too. I don't think they'd introduce even more new characters at this point and it has to be someone we knew.

My money is on the season twist to be in the next episode because that's usually when things start to change.",1,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

The purpose of this test is to determine whether or not our four OG humans (Team cockroaches) will revert to the previous bad habits and tendencies.

And no, neither Janet or Michael are switched... but they are both in on it. Their purpose is to direct our four humans into situations that further test their progress and improvement.

Here is my evidence/reasoning:

Eleanor

* Eleanor has been all over the place this season and is obviously under more pressure than any other character
* Her situation with Chidi is to determine whether she has truly moved on from her habit to hurt those she feels have hurt/taken-advantage-of her

Tahani

* Many people stated that Janet's behaviour has been odd lately; reasoning that she has been switched with a Bad Janet/Vicky. 
* Rather, I believe Janet's behaviour (e.g suggesting Tahani reference the GOT characters, or that she simply confront John) has been putting Tahani in situations where she must fight off her old tendencies to be selfish, self-centred and inconsiderate

Jason

* By forcing Jason to act his old self, they are testing to see whether he will unknowingly revert to who he once was

Evidence:

S4E01 - The demon revealed himself to stress Janet/so that they could switch her when she goes back in the train on her own.

S4E02 - When she broke up with Jason, she told him about Blake Bortals to torture him/try to depress him so he's out of the picture.

S4E03 - She's constantly giving Tahani bad advice.  I mean, look at the boxing gloves she tries to get Tahani to use.

I've looked around and I haven't seen it, but that doesn't mean I'm the first to post about it or think about it.   


Anyway, here's my theory.   


  
I think Michael is still torturing the humans. I think this whole thing is just another reboot, and it's all devised to screw with them because they KEPT beating him, so he decided to torture them as an inside man! So far, everything they've done has ended with one or more of the four humans being miserable. I don't think they ever went back to Earth, I think the judge is just another demon, and I think it's all just an elaborate torture. I think the end of this last season will be us finding out that they've been in the Bad Place the entire time being tortured in Michael's experiment, they'll be rebooted, and it will all happen to them all over again for the rest of time. I DO believe the Good Place exists, but none of the four will ever make it there.   


  
The only thing I'm not sure how to fit in to this theory is Janet. Maybe she IS a Bad Janet? Maybe she's actually a Good Janet who has been changing like they said and is just unaware Michael is actually torturing the humans? Maybe she's just a computer and Michael can program her however he wants, good or bad? Maybe she's another demon? Maybe she's a human and that's HER torture?

The Christian idea of Satan was that he was a fallen angel who had betrayed God.

Its the ultimate embodiment of what another Redditor had pointed out: when Eleanor asks Janet what the answer to everything/the universe is, Janet shows empathy, i.e. the actual answer.

Furthermore. each Good Place episode is labeled as a chapter because the show is acting out a sort of Bible/Ten Commandments/Manifesto-like writing catered to more complicated, modern times. The original Bible (and feel free to replace this with any other sacred text) was meant for simpler, more archaic times; evidently, we as a society have become way too complicated to be determined by old, more black-and-white rules of ethics.

Also Ted Danson gives such a nuanced layered performance. And it feels like there are little moments in there that are off. He was leaning in and laughing way too hard when they were talking in the first scene of episode 3, as though Michael was trying too hard. 

They also do an amazing job with quick cut away reaction shots. Its always someone giving a hilarious or emotional reaction face. Why waste one on having him fiddling with his glasses and his eyes.

So since all 4 subjects are living life in the Good Place as if they deserve it (Chidi/Brent/ John) and then theirs Simon who doesnt believe any of it, They should have sat them down in the beginning and told them that even tho theyre in the Good Place, they have to maintain their moral values and scores that they had on Earth because theyre still being counted. 

With Brent they should have made FAKE things he did for good on Earth and told him that theyll look forward to seeing the good things he can do there in the Good Place. And since theyre still being counted there, they should show him HOW he can see his scores and since hell see it go down (due to him not doing it for good) hell have a realization on why his score is going down and start panicking and possibly turn himself around for the sake of staying in the Good Place. 

With Chidi, hes acting like he deserves to be there at the beginning of episode 4, and again they should sit him down and tell him the same thing. Chidi will have to fight his moral battles with helping the other subjects and end up teaching them moral values. 

John will also be told the same as Brent and  realize the same thing Brent sees which is his scores going down but why? And then realize its because theyre doing everything for their own selfish purposes. 

Simones a little tricky but I feel if they had told her the same thing they would still get a better outcome than what they had in the beginning. Shes still not going to believe any of it but why not REALLY show her shes in Heaven, show her death, her funeral, something that really shows her that shes done for. And once she realizes shes really dead shell be able to maintain her points because she was a pretty good person on Earth.

Look at the Good Place Committee: their actions can easily be also classified as *indecisive* and *inactive*.  A committee to form a committee in 400 years, followed by a 1000-year Blue Ribbon committee to investigate themselves.  Indecisive.  Inactive.  Stuck on cerebral stages.  Who does that remind you of?  (And, BTW, who materializes something &amp;ndash; a mailman uniform &amp;ndash; in Heaven, perhaps without realizing he did it?)

Plus the Committee's demeanor was one-dimensionally cheerful and almost autonomic, but wouldn't that be the case if they were running off base 'programming' without leadership?

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7b2hoe/the_meaning_of_chidi/) even suggests that his last name could *possibly* be translated as ""I am leaving"".  God exists and he's leaving to take a walkabout ... as a human being.

And Chidi seems to know all of the philosophers in existence.  He's a fount of virtually every fact about morality ... plus, of all the four sinners in Team Cockroach (well, five, including Michael), his sins are the least 'evil' IMO, and we haven't really seen him be anything but kind and friendly for the most part in the afterlife.

Think also about the fact that a story element running through the series has been that supernatural entities don't understand humanity until they live life as a human.  The Judge is ready to slam the gavel on Team Cockroach until she goes down and spends a little time on Earth, and she does a complete 180&amp;deg; on her beliefs and attitude.

What if we learn that God decided to live life as Chidi Anagonye so as to get a perspective as to why ""we haven't seen someone in the Good Place in 500+ years"" and what problems exist in the system?",127,1465,False,spoiler,,,,,

There seems to be a common thread of disconnect, especially between how writers/producers/actors/crew see the development of characters &amp; ultimately the storyline and how we as fans interpret the show. Mike Schur describes the first season twist and the twists of later seasons in very different manners. In the 13th episode of the podcast he relates that the twist was a very deliberate subversion of the narrative and that is corroborated by other podcasts guests, especially Ted Danson who notes that he felt compelled to reveal the 1st twist because without it the show did not appear as fantastic as it was.

In podcasts where Mike Schur discusses the finale's of each season, he approaches them much more cinematically and character driven. In the third season finale Mike Schur details in depth the centrality of the film ""Cinema Paradisio"", a 1988 film from which he borrows idea of Eleanor and Chidi watching their past romance as a way to both culminate the arc of those characters in season 3 and set up further development of them in season 4. 

While teasers like that at the end of the last episode are exciting cliffhangers, they aren't indicative of what the intent of this final season will be. Based on the listing of Glenn's actor Josh Siegel in the credits despite not being in the episode (alongside his prominence in ""The Selection"" webisodes) we could assume reasonably its him. And more importantly, that  his inclusion in the credits was likely not a mistake in a show where every twist is carefully controlled.

Ultimately, I believe that this season's ""twist"" will parallel that of the past 2 seasons, Chidi and Eleanor reuniting through one of them realizing their personalities inherently match. 

Twists are a part of the show, and I don't know what exactly will happen obviously,  but the common thread is that Chidi's harmful indecisiveness and Eleanor's narcissistic self confidence are resolved through their relationship's with each other. We have in some form seen this flipped this season, with Eleanor's worry over unethically pushing Chidi too far in the last episode and Chidi having confidence until Jason is introduced to him. That is a stretch honestly, but not even the first season twist betrays the central theme that Chidi and Eleanor ultimately resolve their unethical behavior because they learn and support each other as opposites, and it would not make sense for some strange revelation that one of them is god or the entire series has been one experiment to over turn that relationship.

Also what a better way for the bad place to mess with Eleanor (and the experiment) than to force her to mess with Chidi? They can stall out the ethics lessons with a fake Chidi, keeping the actual subjects of the experiment from making any progress. (See his actions in this last episode, what Chidi do we know would choose a day outside over ethics?) 

Eleanor gets tortured with all of her emotions regarding his 'reboot' and all the things that go along with it. (He forgets her name in the first episode of the season, recall back to the first season, he literally remembered every detail she gave him when they first met) She also stands to lose the one thing that gives her an edge over the bad place -her confidence and self assuredness.

No in the sense they didnt see that coming but in the sense they know it, they always knew it, and they might be actively responsible for it.* 

So I dont know if it already has been explored, but I tried searching on the sub and I dont think I found anything like that. So let me explain a theory: the people rigging the points system are not the demons, but the accountants. 

Its kind of stretch, and I dont think Im pretty sure myself of it, but I want your advice on it, just to see if Im plain crazy or if something true can be find from this. 

Obviously, accountants are guilty of negligence. More than 500 years and no one, no one has ever question the fact that anyone went to the Good Place. If theyre accountants, they must have charts showing the evolution of people going to each place, and no one ever question that the curve of people going to the Good Place was decreasing, while people going to the Bad Place went to 100% (minus Mindy)? 

When I saw Matt (the accountant in charge of Weird Sex Things, now place as the accountant of the experiment) present, my first impression was Oh, good, I like the accountants. Like the demons. Not the heroes, but good support characters. But why is he here? Cant the accountants count the points from their offices? They are in the Medium Place, same plane as Mindys neighborhood. So is Matt only here to worldbuilding? It could be. But Im a little uncomfortable with it. 

First, Matt didnt say any joke. He just said he was here to count the points and then went into his pyramidal thing. Why? Cant the Judge says that Accountants would monitor this, as easily? Scenaristically, it makes no sense. No, writers are clever, and they wanted us to know that accountants are not forgotten and they will return. OK, they will return, but what for? 

Secondly, the pyramid is the same used by Michael in one of the 800 reboots. Maybe its just a common thing in the Afterlife, used by all Places. But why would they show us something that was blatantly used by a demon? Again, clever writers, maybe its some kind of clue. 

Third, Matt specifically said that nobody would be able to see the counting in real time. Why? Not even the Judge? What does that mean, why do they keep it secret? Is it because they want to look at the numbers and falsify them before handing them to the Judge? The fact that they precise this sentence is big, too big for me, and we know the writers are clever (did I mentioned that? Dont think I did) and that they let clues everywhere. Even in the most mundane sentence of the most mundane character. 

So, maybe the Bad Place have infiltrated the Accountant Department, but I dont know why, Shawn never really looked like if they did. He never felt like someone who rigged the system, but like someone who figured out how the system worked at his advantage and keeping the secret rather than losing all those souls to torture. I dont feel like demons are actively involved, I dont feel it at all. Maybe they cooperate (actively or passively) but I dont think they are the one doing it on purpose. 

When money disappear from an organization or a company, the first people suspected are, of course, presidents and such, but the next-in-line is the Chief Accountant, because he has access to everything. They can rig the system, they can change the numbers, and they can act together. What would have make all the accountants collude together to do it? I dont really know. But they have the mean and the opportunity to do it. Only the motive is missing, and I might have an idea : 

People said that the Good Place committee or the Judge might have never updated their moral codes. But when something new appear, they are not the ones saying if its good or bad. Its the accountants. They judge each and every new actions, according to some system we know nothing about. Theyre the one in charge. So theyre responsible. Maybe their motive is just that, one day, they figure that their way to calculate the goodness of a new action is bad, but since admitting that would make them look as incompetent, they kept the secret. And they will try to keep it, and they could, since theyre the one counting the points. They could change the points or (since all actions in the Good Place are new) change the way theyre counting and making them bad decisions. What if, when Neil is upset about Michael questioning the counting system, its not because he think its correct, but because he fears that Michael might discover the truth? What if his trust in the system is just because he knows its incorrect but fear that all the service would be marbilized because of his incompetence?

I had this thought yesterday and I am totally unfamiliar with philosophy, morals, and ethics, so please bear with me clumsily trying to explain.

T. M. Scanlon in What We Owe to Each Other talks about contractualism. And we hear references to this come up time and again. 

[Heres a helpful summary from u/huadpe about what Scanlon is getting at.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7ussqs/philosophy_friday_what_we_owe_to_each_other/)

Basically: by living in a society everyone enters in an agreement, or contract, about how to behave. Things that are right or wrong are all about whether you uphold those agreements. You can modify these agreements if everyone agrees, but the important part is that everybody gets an equal day in whats fair. So if were playing go fish and I want to cheat, then we can change the rules of the game so that everyone can cheat. 

If we all agree, theres nothing wrong with cheating, and actually it isnt even cheating anymore, because weve all agreed that its just part of the game. By all agreeing on what were ok with, and by all of us being equally able to veto what were not ok with (as long as theres an actual reason and its not just because I said so), *were* the ones who decide whats right and whats wrong, or more relevantly to the show, whats good and whats bad. 

Prior to Scanlon, Rawls thought that what was right and wrong needed to be decided in a hypothetical world, because we all have our own biases and baggage that we carry along whenever we decide whether something is an agreement or not. But Scanlon says that the rules should be determined based on the people in the group being who they are and that you dont need to try to do guesswork about the society you create, you can just roll with it.

So, what this means to me, is that sure, the points system is wrong. But thats because every society, every group of people, develop their own points system. Something wrong in one society is perfectly fine in another. There are cultural differences throughout the world, and it would make sense that something thats wrong in my culture is perfectly fine in someone elses.

This means that the neighborhood, or more accurately, the cockroaches, are their own society. By agreeing on their own set of rules that others, not in their society, may disagree with (torturing people is wrong, but making fun of Jason for being dumb isnt), theyve defined their own morality.

In addition, u/huadpe says that contractualism is about wrongness. And whatever is right, is simply just whats NOT wrong. The reason the points system doesnt work is because theyre not accumulating points for being good, theyre just not losing points. Its the absence of wrongness, not the presence of goodness.

Each time the cockroaches (including Janet and Michael) face a dilemma, its a moment that they form an agreement about whats good and whats not. In S1, one of the very first contracts they form, and the one that dictates the formation of the rest of the rules, is that they always help each other. Every decision made by every individual is the formation of their own morality. Each moment of torture, either intentional on the part of Michael or as something thats simply a hard decision that doesnt belong in heaven (like Eleanors decision to torture Chidi in S4) brings about another agreement on whats good and whats not, and the more clearly defined their own moral code becomes, and therefore the better people they become by agreeing to it. 

Its also clear that its only because of forming a society with each other that they make any progress at all. Every time someone deviates from what theyve all determined to be good, its remarkably unsuccessful; Eleanor having a selfish moment and reverting to me vs. us, as Simone says, is quickly acknowledged as being detrimental to the whole society, and corrected.

When considering the trolley problem, (which is what I think Chidis sacrifice by having his memory wiped fundamentally is), Scanlon says that its not as clear cut as kill one to save 5, and that [its the justification to others that determines whether its alright](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/). Can Chidis self sacrifice be rejected by a reasonable person? Does his contract to humanity supersede his contract to humanity? Is it a reasonable objection on Eleanors part that hes done this? Just some food for thought, I guess.

But basically, as long as they have free will (which Michael insisted they do in S3), the agreements theyve explicitly or implicitly formed are truly their own morality. They are good because theyve formed their own definition of good. It doesnt matter if their motivations are corrupt, simply because they all agree not to care. As they expand their society to include the 3 new humans, they can revise their agreements for whats permissible and whats not, but theres no way for them not to improve. Theyre all good simply because they say so.

TL;DR: the cockroaches must belong in The Good Place because theyre the ones who decide whats good.",4,22,False,self,,,,,

1) There was a switch on the train. Michael is still our Michael, but I'm going with others who have speculated that Janet got switched with an advanced, multi-rebooted Bad Janet. It would explain her strange behavior, plus I really, really want to see a montage of Shawn killing Bad Janet over and over (with apologies to D'Arcy).

2) What if the Bad Place was never meant to be the Bad Place? What if it's original purpose was much like our current experiment, to make humans better and eventually good enough for the Good Place? And just like Eleanor, they realized in order to make them better, they had to make them a little miserable?

Bear with me as I cover my original, then continue into madness... But the gist of it is  :
&gt;!""Eleanor is alone, surrounded by demons""!&lt; 
Previously, I supposed that :
1. Chris (or now I'm thinking possibly Brent) had nabbed Janet and replaced her with a Bad Janet. This explains Janet's change in behavior, stress, aggressiveness, etc.  I think S04E03 supported the Janet-was-replaced theory throughout the entire episode. But very much so when she suggested Tahani punch John. Janet's meanness towards Jason was also a dead giveaway. 

2. Bad Janet subdued Michael on the train at the end of S04E01. The Michael that exited the train was Vicky in a Michael suit. Since then Michael has said some off things. S04E03  ""It's so great he erased his memory.  But, but, it's also quite sad for you [Eleanor]."" Michael wouldn't have said ""it's so great..."" I wasn't convinced Michael had been swapped in Ep2, but Ep3 really made me believe this isn't the real Michael.

Now for the new... Chris Baker wasn't the only plant.  Shawn said to his team on episode 1 ""... and believe me, we are going to create some uh-Problems."" And it's worth noting that Vicky was absent from Shawn's team meeting. Now that Janet and Michael are compromised, the rest of the Soul Squad is being replaced.

3. Chidi was not himself in episode 3.  He was largely himself in episode 2. But he is Chillaxing in epsiode 3.  Last we saw Chidi in episode 2, he was with Simone. Simone was out of character from the moment she arrived in the neighborhood. Simone was a demon in disguise, and is now wearing a Chidi suit. Simone is absent in episode 3. No way Chidi would say ""Well honestly, when the weather is this perfect, I think that Kant would say who's up for some Frisbee golf?"" then proceed to make more Kant jokes.  Why wouldn't Chidi and Simone be spending that beautiful day together?

4. Jason is himself in episode 2, but for some, if not all, of episode 3, he's off as well. Jason staring at a fountain was weird. But the stuff Jason says throughout the episode is 'off.'  Like he's trying to imitate what Jason might say, but missing the mark. That whole peanut butter jar thing was just weird. Although maybe when Michael ""There you are"", Jason heard ""Peanut butter Jar."" idk...  And Chidi says ""No more meatball subs"" when they're hanging in his shiny new budd-hole. Jason has always been a wings guy. Shortly after Eleanor says to Jason ""Chidi isn't even dry heaving yet"", Chidi comes to her office and starts dry-heaving.  He was possibly body-snatched after meeting demon-Chidi?  When Jason threw his rock, he didn't yell Bortles. He always yells Bortles.

5. Tahani made it longer than the rest, but I fear she was replaced at the end of episode 3. Being at the end of the episode, it's really hard to confirm.  But she and John went for their walk, and I suspect that was the last we saw of the real Tahani. When she and Jason enter Eleanor's office, she starts with ""I win"" then corrects herself to ""I'll start."" She continues to say she and John are going to seek a genuine human connection by unironically watching Britney Spears 'crossroads.'  The movie has a 14% rating on RT.  Why would anyone watch that movie except to mock it?

I really think the verbal slips that the characters make with their speech and correct themselves are a flag that they aren't themselves.  

I'm wondering if when we see a couple 'leave' together, or be left alone together, that's an indicator they've been replaced?  
1. Janet was replaced when she left the scene with Brent in episode 1. 
2. Michael is replaced when Bad Janet and Michael board the train at the end of episode 1.
3. Chidi is replaced either when Eleanor leaves Chidi and Simone at the yogurt shop. 
4. Jason perplexes me... Maybe he was himself in the beginning of episode 3, and got switched somewhere in episode 3?  idk...  Chidi's place?
5. Tahani she and John take their walk.
 
Episode 4 is titled *Tinker, Tailor, Demon, Spy*.  The book *Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy* is a spy novel about hunting a mole in the British Intelligence Service. Eleanor is going to figure out there is a spy among the soul squad, and try to figure out who it is. The twist being that it's everyone but her.",7,18,False,self,,,,,

Alright, so if we know anything about TGP, its that everything is intentional. The GQ interview above from seasons past gives a huge insight to the intentional choices behind certain costume and color choices.

Referring back to the most recent episode, Chillaxing, Eleanor and Michael are seen matching in yellow. She is in a yellow sweater and he is in a yellow bow tie. But Janet, however, is still wearing purple.

Now, this can easily be boiled down to Janet perpetuating her basic S1 costume to provide consistency in the neighborhood. And lets not forget the Jason breakup element. But I still think she got switched on the train.

Heres why:
As Michael grew closer to Team Cockroach in S3, Michael started wearing more purples and blues, matching Janet. It was the 4 humans and then Michael/Janet. His bow tie would parallel her ascot and vest patterns. Now, hes matching Eleanor. Yes, Eleanor and Michael are growing closer, but does that mean Janet should be moving out? Also, if you read the GQ article, there is an intentional use of pink/red. The costume designer stated that red = bad. Janet has pink streaks in her hair. I believe this is Bad Janet giving us a clue that she is truly forking with the neighborhood. Also, our Janet has showed a strong evolution over 3 seasons. Wouldnt our Janet evolve with Michael and Eleanor, marching their costume colors to exhibit unity and goodness?

Regardless of how overwhelmed she feels in the neighborhood with Jason and Derek and the Janet babies, Janet has showed resilience in tougher situations (aka when everyone was in her void, when she portrayed Bad Janet, etc.) It wouldnt make sense that this experiment is the thing that makes her crumble, no matter how human she is becoming.

Although I object to the specific theory of the gang having never left the Bad Place as being totally against the spirit/message of the show, from some recent posts, it also struck me that paradoxically, any version of the twist would be too obvious, because the show doesn't really hide the fact that the mains are still being ""tortured"". 

Besides the fact that the Bad Place explicitly chose subjects this season to torture Team Cockroach, in terms of Michael's motives and actions, although Michael originally created the Good Place thinking it would be the perfect torture,  he accidentally created an environment that made Team Cockroach better people, and now that environment is being recreated with the goal of making humans into better people.  And if you believe (as I kind of do) that Team Cockroach are also subjects to prove to the Judge that humans can improve, then it also makes sense that they are being ""tortured"" as well.

Which is why I think that Michael accidentally made Team Cockroach better people to begin with- he created an overall pleasurable environment without many of the strains of mortal life, and then introduced scenarios which forced Team Cockroach to  reexamine themselves.  And that's why the same set-up works when re-created with the goal of moral improvement.

And I'm putting the word torture in quotes here, because there is a very thin line between a lot of the tortures in the Good Place and the kind of everyday struggles people go through as part of being in a society.  Similarly, the tortures play/played upon genuine faults of Team Cockroach which they needed to correct in order to be better people and to be happier overall. 

So, for example, Michael explicitly brings up this season how he chose to torture Jason by making him pretend to be a silent monk, because Jason's fundamental flaw is his lack of impulse control.  Now you could argue (and people have) that Michael is improving on the torture this season by getting Jason to happily consent to being tortured, but pretending to be a monk actually did help Jason learn some impulse control and as seen in the last episode, Jason actually wants to pull back on acting like his old self, because he realizes he's (unduly) hurting Chidi.

Similarly, John was explicitly sent by the Bad Place to torture Tahani, but she ends up making him a somewhat better person as well as further improving herself.

And you can see the same for Eleanor and maybe for Chidi too (he does seem more decisive overall).

Granted, if Michael is evil either because he has been all along or because he  and Janet were replaced (which I doubt), then ultimately, the rug would eventually be pulled back and the butthole spiders would come out (go in).

But barring that, it seems to me that any ""torture"" Team Cockroach is undergoing is some combination of what Shawn is explicitly doing (in an attempt) to torture them, part and parcel of being a good person generally and/or is being done to help them (probably by Michael and Janet and/or the Judge).",1,28,False,self,,,,,

I think the mysterious figure is none other than Glenn.  Okay, so I think the popular theories are Real Michael, Real Janet, Vicky as Michael, Trevor, Glenn, or Shawn. I was looking through this subreddit when I found a promo for the next episode. It shows the hooded person coming to the station. You could see their hands and they looked like they belonged to the arms of a Caucasian person. At the end, there was a shot of the figure facing the group with its hood still on. I zoomed on it. Theres a spot under the hood thats not covered by the cloak. I saw what appeared to be a black tie in a white collared shirt. 

If it was any form of Michael, it would be a bow tie, and that was not a bow tie. Its definitely not Janet, as we all know she hasnt worn a tie on the show. It might still be Trevor or Shawn. Trevor doesnt have a really normal outfit that he wears (He normally wears a leather jacket, but on occasions, it varies), so I think theres like a 3-10% chance of the cloaked figure being Trevor. 

Heres the reason why I dont think its Shawn: Shawn is under high surveillance by the judge. He is to be nowhere near this experiment. Also, in episode promo pictures, there are a few pictures of him in his office in The Bad Place, so I think thats where hes gonna be during this episode. 

Heres why I am almost certain it is Glenn.  

1. Glenns got the wardrobe. Glenn wears a dark tie on a light collared shirt a lot. It almost looks like theres a greyish beard on the hooded guy. 

2. Glenn has a motive. Glenn is going to switch to the good side. Glenn has always been the punching bag of the demons. At some times, he appear to actually have morals. In the web series, Glenn expresses doubt about the demons selecting Simone for the experiment. All the demons are horrible to Glenn. Maybe he just wants to get away from them to avoid harassment and The Soul Squad are the only people he think can help, or he genuinely thinks what theyre doing is right. 

3. This is the most damning part to me: On IMDB, Josh Siegel is listed for his role as Glenn on the episode, Chillaxing. We didnt see Glenn in that episode, or at least we didnt know we did. The hooded figure appeared in that episode, therefore Glenn appeared in that episode, therefore IMDB credited Josh Siegel for playing Glenn in that episode.

At first I thought it might be Eleanor but that ending just seems too simple (especially for a show like this). My reason for thinking it might be Chidi is because the entire show he is making decision and us viewers are seeing when it leads to good or bad. We also find that the point system of choices is corrupt by consequences which is what Chidi struggles with the most. I also thought it might be a prototype test for demons to see if they can be reformed to work in ""The Good Place"".

It really was a great title in the sense that one, it was a clever play on words about a espionage film where people working for the enemy provide information to the protagonists and ultimately find out that one person has been a double agent the whole. It also is clever in that it shows the misdirection of the episode, that the demon (Glenn)  was not the spy but instead someone who had been working with the Humans undercover (Bad Janet). 

The next episodes title is ""Employee of the Bearimy"", likely NOT a direct reference to the awful 2006 film ""Employee of The Month"" which starred Dax Shepard, but perhaps means that Jasons past success as pretending to be demon will play a crucial role in him saving Janet.

Jason and Michael could possibly run into Dax Shepard's demon character and inadvertently distract him from either torturing Janet or impress Dax's character enough that he gains an audience with Sean which would allow him to act on his plan of punching the bully back (probably a Molotov Cocktail) allowing Michael to rescue Janet. This also would act to rekindle the romantic arc between Janet and Jason.

In the good place the title could also implicate that Eleanor reveals some level of how much time her and Chidi have truly spent together because of how Jeremy Bearimy works, not necessarily in a way that would spoil the experiment but enough that it would introduce a conflict that would lead Chidi learning that him and Simone dated on earth or that Eleanor and Chidi have been in love before. 

Either way I think the title has to imply that some level of timeline trickery is involved in the next episodes conflict as well as some aspect of bad place/good place employee of the month scenerio.",3,55,False,spoiler,,,,,

While I by no means am trying to victim blame, as no one deserves to be sexually harassed, including Bad Janet, I'm thinking in retrospect that this is also a foreshadowing of Bad Janet, even though Bad Janet's apparent ""grin and bear it"" attitude didn't seem obviously out-of-character in or out of universe (and I'm mindful that physically harming Brent would probably ruin the experiment).

Basically, I'm thinking that Brent's harassment is conspicuously absent in previous episodes when Team Cockroach is talking about whether the new humans are improving, and this is because while the real Janet would have brought this up as something that needed to stop, in part because their goal is to make their new test humans better.  But since Bad Janet wants the experiment to fail, she doesn't really do anything except act mildly annoyed (and mildly annoyed is a Bad Janet's default state).

Not the same one from the judge that Michael and Janet, but one from higher ups who are puppet mastering everything weve seen so far.

To steal a quote from ""Good Omens"", another of my favorite good vs. evil stories:

You see, evil always contains the seeds of its own destruction, said the angel. It is ultimately negative, and therefore encompasses its downfall even at its moments of apparent triumph. No matter how grandiose, how well-planned, how apparently foolproof an evil plan, the inherent sinfulness will by definition rebound upon its instigators. No matter how apparently successful it may seem upon the way, at the end it will wreck itself. It will founder upon the rocks of iniquity and sink headfirst to vanish without trace into the seas of oblivion.

And while I like the idea of that, it just doesn't make sense - Eleanor became a substantially better person in the first season as well as the second - why would he mess with progress? So my suggestion is that the show isn't about Eleanor or Tahani's or Chidi's change - it's about *Jason*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Think about it. People complained that Jason didn't improve enough in the first and second seasons - which is true. Even in season 2, when it looked like he had improved, he still failed to pass the test that was set out for him, due to his impulsiveness. But in season 3, Jason does change. There's [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9ka2b3/theory_jason_is_actually_the_most_good_of_the/) that goes into much greater detail about how much Jason has changed, talking about how he is resolving his issues. And I doubt that it's a coincidence that this is the first season where all of their memories weren't wiped. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at what Jason has done in this season alone, he helped Chidi in episode 3 and actually was the first to object to making Chidi more miserable, claiming that he was going through a lot, and quite obviously actually saving them in episode 4. Jason is finally improving, and for the first time, this change may actually be permanent.

He is a genuinely kind-hearted person, but his lack of self-awareness and impulsiveness are character traits that really seem to impede any moral or ethical growth. And while he has made some progress, he hasn't made progress with the core traits that caused him to do a lot of damage. However, when he establishes a bond with someone, he shows them intense kindness and compassion - and if they cross him, or show their real intentions are bad, he doesn't hesitate to leap into action.

Having said that, one thing we need to remember - Jason has maintained total control for this entire season. Remember how he couldn't keep himself together for a week as Jiyanu in Test 1? Chidi is now seeing how bad Jason used to be, and he really was that terrible to deal with. 

But, he's totally fine now. He's maintaining Jianyu AND also double acting as Jason-Jason, while being normal Jason. When you take those into consideration, it's clear he's changed for the better, but is it enough to get a good place ticket? I don't think so. Which is why....

...He shouldn't go to TGP.

&gt;!He should replace Sean as the leader of the demons... he likes fire, he's a bit destructive and could relate to the demons (as shown when they went to TBP), but he's also wise enough to spot a genuinely good person, care for others and be compassionate when needed. Michael would also be there to guide and help him - since he'd need a positive influence to maintain a balance, he'd be a great agent of positive change to make TBP an actual bad place for BAD people - which he'd recognize - and make sure GOOD people stay out. And I think he'd make sure mildly crappy people get mildly crappy punishments, his sweetness but also lack of awareness might ensure he's fine with the job, especially with Michael helping him out.!&lt;

&gt;!I could see him being a great 'judge' of sorts to see who really is a BAD-bad person, or a good-bad person!&lt; since he has a very gentle, kind heart \[Underneath a loooooooot of Molotov cocktails\] and can spot that in other people.",8,39,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here are my little chicken nuggets of supporting evidence...

- standard biblical archangel name (low hanging fruit I know)

- Michael was an apprentice for 200 years before finally getting the chance to step up as an architect, Tortured the humans for 300 years putting his total bad place time just short of the 521 years since someone got into the good place. However we know that time works differently in the afterlife thanks to Jeremy Bearimy so we dont know if the 521 is earth years.

- Was able to steal a Janet from the good place Janet warehouse (I know this is explained as the good place simply being too trusting but what if its because hes permitted to be there?)

- Met with the good place council but their presence has been noticeably absent from the experiment, Shawn is invited as a representative from the bad place but no one from the good place joins - surely at this point Michael as a demon would be more neutral than good so the experiment would still be more heavily weighted to bad, Gen being the judge would likely have done more to balance the scales.

- wouldnt remove his skin suit to show he wasnt Vicky, yes he gave the classic giant flame squid excuse weve all heard soo many times before, but could be he actually doesnt have a skin suit on...

So with Jeremy Bearimy in mind (time loops around back on itself) is it possible, that the good place council, after theyd been called to the meeting and selecting the committee that would choose someone to go, picked Michael the very person who called them, to infiltrate the bad place posing as an apprentice and put things right?

The Angel Michael leaping from afterlife to afterlife, striving to put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap... will be the leap home.

\- First of all, I don't think the writers would use the same plot twist twice. It would also erase lots of emotional development and that would be kinda weird  
\- Michael has been genuinely helpful and thoughtful towards the team! He gave Eleanor two pep talks and they actually lift up her morale and help her see what she's worth. Plus he was truly worried and sad about Chidi being miserable in episode 3. Had he just been Vicky, he would have encouraged Eleanor to keep torturing him.

\- Comparing this to fake Janet, she hasn't had many emotional moments in the last episodes. The few times she was alone with the team she was delivering bad news (blake bortles) or awful ideas (questioning Eleanor's leadership, suggesting Tahani she punched John). Meanwhile all of Michael's interactions seemed sincere.

\- 'Take it sleezy', there is no way Vicky knew about that

The ONLY way the Vicky theory could work would be if she was actually starting to become a good person/demon, much like Michael. That would be a cool twist and could also maybe persuade the Judge into thinking that redemption can be achieved, even for a demon.

That being said it still wouldn't explaing how Vicky could have known about 'take it sleezy'.

* Michael is actually God. Because of the red tape that heaven is forced to go through, he is doing an undercover boss situation to expose it.
* They have still been in the bad place the whole time. Yea, we have seen it already, but it seems weird to me that some demon like Michael would up and become good. It also seems weird that they have been getting closer and closer to the good place, only to have it pulled away from them. I think it would be a cool twist that Michael didnt actually screw up at the end of season 1. This could also be a side scenario to Michael actually being Vicky.
* This is all in Eleanor's head. As indicated by Simone's ramblings, it seems plausible that an elaborate scenario like this could be thought up in someone's head while in a coma. I think it is plausible that Eleanor is in a coma from her accident and will now change her life based on her dream.

I have been back and forth on it for a while now and I have settled on a few main reasons why I think it's the real Michael

The first is ""take it sleazy"" now most people seem to be arguing that Vicky wouldn't know that phrase. But I think it actually goes deeper than that. Everyones minds have been erased 800+ times. And the only one who has any memory is Eleanor and unless we are to assume she saw every memory from her entire afterlife, which is obviously not the case. Then this wasn't meant as a nod for anyone to pick up. It was the writers speaking directly to the audience. Telling us not to fret, this is our Michael.

Next, comes the fact that Michael has been seriously helpful these past 4 episodes. He's supported Eleanor through this entire process. And genuinely hates seeing his friends in pain, something i dont think even Vicky the Demon could pull off. 

The final point is the fact that this show has a damn good writing team, and they wouldn't reuse the same plot twist twice. And I know other people have mentioned this fact, but I'm actually gonna take it a step further a predict why this is our Michael and where problems are going to arise. Jason has kinda been on top of stuff the whole series, subtlety and mostly accidentally but still a major help throughout the series. Now with the mention of the Fire Squid last week, and the fact Jason and Michael are going to the bad place. I believe Michael and Jason are gonna run into Michael and Shawn in the Bad Place. With Vicky acting as a prisoner and Michael stunned as to how to prove he's the real him. At which point Jason asks to see the Fire Squid form, as he's clearly dying to see. Providing the perfect distraction for Jason to save Janet, and punch Shawn in the mouth. Thus closing the is it Michael is it Vicky problem.",12,66,False,spoiler,,,,,

Said alternate reality is based on the premise of this song's musical, where the main guy finds out his wife has been lying to him about her identity for years, and they break up despite still loving each other. This premise (which I don't think would ever ACTUALLY happen btw, since in all the reboots Eleanor always seems to trust and confide in Chidi instantly) would be if Eleanor had kept faking who she was and stayed in a soulmates-relationship with Chidi. This song is what would occur after they fell in love, and far down the line, Chidi finally found out Eleanor had been lying about her entire life to him.

People get really excited theorizing about who is and isn't God and so on but the whole point of the system is that it's not what we are used to for afterlife. The idea that there's just one all powerful deity that overrides the Judge, all the accountants, and the councils seems just... Redundant.

Not to mention when Michael is saying who got it ""a little bit right"" in Season 1 (and remember this is one of the bits of truth to sell the lie) he mentions Hindus first, Hindus are polytheistic with many different gods and goddesses. And he mentions Buddhists too which have no ""gods"" in the traditional sense. 

I think so many of us are used to the idea of one God. Plus the use of demons for The Bad Place people get us thinking on a judeochristian track. We are all Tahani wanting to there to be a higher management that can be appealed to, but I believe the show is trying to nudge us away from that and instead into taking the afterlife and the good in people into our own hands.

My reasoning for this comes from season 4 where Chidi upon realizing he's in the (fake) Good Place finally relaxes and decides to do non-Chidi things like playing frisbee and wearing sandals.

I feel like this would go on to apply to many people in  the after life. Imagine you live a good life your entire life and are rewarded with a world beyond your imagination free of consequences, stresses or responsibilities. 

You would want to try something bad wouldn't you? It might not happen right away but it would be tempting to do so because now you can do whatever you want, you've already gotten your reward so why not choose what to do with it?

As such over time people in the Good Place would become more morally corrupt and since everyone up until recently believed that the point system was infallible it's not like these bad people would be sent to the Bad Place. 

Now I could be wrong and people in the Good Place are still good people but when the opportunity presents itself to do something morally wrong with no consequences they would take it.

In the end, somehow, Eleanor will have to make the decision to either save humanity (e.g., reforming the way it's decided how people either go to the Good place or the Bad Place) OR saving herself/ending up with Chidi/'living' happily ever after (a sort of ULTIMATE Trolley Problem). The whole show will have been a simulation, of sorts, a la (BLACK MIRROR SPOILER!) Black Mirror's 'Hang the DJ' episode. When she decides to save humanity, she is told that this has all been a test, which she has passed, and she can now go to the Good Place. We find out that many, if not everyone, is given a test of this kind after they die as a sort of purgatorial final exam. 

Breadcrumbs in the show that lead me to this idea ... 
1) The show made way too big a deal about Chidi's memory being erased at the end of Season 3. Sure, it's sad, but Chidi has been reset hundreds of times on the show already, and Eleanor &amp; Chidi still 'found' each other each time, so ... it got me to thinking that this might have been a sort of major ending for their relationship ... as we know it. 

2) Simone's belief that the Good Place is the fiction of her last neurons firing off just before she dies could be planting the seed that this whole thing isn't real ... but not in the way she believes.

3) Part of the humor of the show is that the universe is full of powerful, immortal beings, but that they all have the same scruples and hangups of regular earthlings (an almighty judge who enjoys Deadwood). However, it will be shown that 'the powers that be' actually DO know what they are doing.

So, when Eleanor decides to save humanity and is welcomed into the real Good Place in the end, is the whole gang there? Jameela Jamil said the ending is 'perfect' but 'devastating'. So as to whether Eleanor gets back together with Chidi, Tahani, etc.? No idea. (Though, come on, it's a sitcom, so happy ending rules apply.)

Tonight/tomorrow's episode (depending on where you live) will feature an 'Earth Day' where Eleanor will announce that while Janet is offline for 'technical issues', there will be a day where people can do the things they loved to do on Earth, but the four humans being tested will go on some lake house holiday which Brent really doesn't like (Eleanor torturing him/them maybe) Anyhow, the overall idea of the episode is that Eleanor finds running the neighbourhood difficult and Michael and Jason make a plan to rescue Janet

The episode after's description is: ""One of the new residents creates a division in the ranks"" I have no idea what this may mean, but I'd love to hear theories. The title is ""A chip driver mystery"" I can't really figure out what this could mean.

In Episode 7, there is an obvious big plot point of the season, because this is when the final day of the experiment is. One year is up. The description states that Chidi will face a final big ethical dilemma and the title is ""Help is other people"" A theory going around says that Chidi will choose between Eleanor and Simone, yet the title of this episode goes against this and I think this Chidi thing will happen but at a later stage - I don't think this is that huge final ethical dilemma thing that will happen, yet I don't know what it will be.

It didn't serve any purpose really. The writers could have easily made another reason why Jason doesn't throw a moltov cocktail. 
So perhaps there is another reason they brought it up? Maybe it's just planting that ability for a future plot twist/development?

I believe there's a homage to Radiohead's video clip for ""Just"".  
For those unfamiliar with the video clip, it shows a man walking down the street and deciding to lie down on the curb for no apparent reason. A man trips over him, asking him why he's there and if he's ok, the man lying down just tells him to go away and everything is fine.  
Throughout the video a bunch of people gather around him, trying to figure out what's the deal with him (the man who tripped over him asks ""You don't think there's any point right? What, that we're all going to die? Is that it? Is that why you're lying here?"")  
Eventually, the man lying down gives up and agrees to tell them why and adding ""But god forgive me, and god help us all, because you don't know what you ask of me""  
He starts to speak, the camera cuts to the band looking down through a window, and the final shot reveals everyone who begged the man for an answer lying on the curb.  
I simply couldn't imagine all the extras dropping dead after Derek reboots himself is somewhat inspired by the video clip, especially when Tahani said to Chidi his puzzle will reveal ""The truth about the universe"" or whatever.",0,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Every episode had a good dose of philosophy, morality, explanations of complex and important ideas.

But this season... what have we learned about morality?, what have we learned about ethics?.

When they introduced Chidi's magic library I was sure we would see him summoning books left and right as the characters discussed complex ethical ideas, but he's done it twice and he never even open those books.

I think the main problem is that the show is scared of 2 things.

The first one is to loose focus on the original group. We have to stay with Jason, Tahani and Eleanor, but as a result we don't see how the new humans progress.

It would be so interesting to have episodes dediccated to baby boomer for example, to understand why he is the way he is, same has we had with Eleanor or Chidi. Heck, we could have Eleanor experimenting the memories of the new humans in order to understand them. We could have each of the original humans living the memories of the new ones trying to understand them and help them, but that would require to split the group for several episodes and god forbid that.

Or I don't know, there are a million ways to write this, but I think that the one they are choosing is not as engaging as before

PD:

This show loves to change the status quo, to change the stablished dynamics just as we get used to them, right?, I hope they do that soon.

I hope Chidi figures out he's in the bad place, or learns the truth about Eleanor, or the humans escape, or something God please just make this show as interesting as it can be",9,8,False,self,,,,,

For the first time, were seeing a relaxed, happy Chidi. Obviously, as was stated earlier in this season, when he believes that hes in The Good Place and isnt being tortured, hes chillaxing Chidi. 

And Eleanor is seeing this for the first time, too. Its painful to see him happy without her, but she DOES like seeing him happy, so much so that theyve backed off a bit on the torture Chidi stuff. My guess is that at some point, Eleanor will have the option to give Chidi his memories back, but shell choose not to do it. This way, he can live in peace and happiness and not in a state of anxiety and stress. Eleanor can spend the rest of eternity taking care of Chidi and watching him be happy, spared of the memories of 300 years of reboots and anxiety. 

On the other hand, there are a lot of reasons why this wouldnt make sense - mainly that he loves Eleanor and that love is important - but theyve dropped a lot of hints that Eleanor would put Chidis happiness before her own. And Chidi and Simone are a genuinely good couple, and their relationship is free of all the difficult stuff that has come along with his relationship with Eleanor. Their relationship is simpler, they click, and they make each other happy. Maybe soulmates arent real, or we can have multiple soul mates since there are so many fish in the sea, so to speak. So maybe Eleanor takes on a permanent architect type role watching over humanity and Chidi for eternity.

On a cru que je voulais dire par l que nos rapports avec les autres taient toujours empoisonns, que c'tait toujours des rapports infernaux. Or, c'est tout autre chose que je veux dire. Je veux dire que si les rapports avec autrui sont tordus, vicis, alors l'autre ne peut tre que l'enfer. Pourquoi ? Parce que les autres sont, au fond, ce qu'il y a de plus important en nous-mmes, pour notre propre connaissance de nous-mmes. Quand nous pensons sur nous, quand nous essayons de nous connatre, au fond nous usons des connaissances que les autres ont dj sur nous, nous nous jugeons avec les moyens que les autres ont, nous ont donn, de nous juger. Quoi que je dise sur moi, toujours le jugement d'autrui entre dedans. Quoi que je sente de moi, le jugement d'autrui entre dedans. Ce qui veut dire que, si mes rapports sont mauvais, je me mets dans la totale dpendance d'autrui et alors, en effet, je suis en enfer. Et il existe une quantit de gens dans le monde qui sont en enfer parce qu'ils dpendent trop du jugement d'autrui. Mais cela ne veut nullement dire qu'on ne puisse avoir d'autres rapports avec les autres, a marque simplement l'importance capitale de tous les autres pour chacun de nous5.

I the first neighborhood he had to move in with Eleanor to explain their ethics lessons. So its hard to compare. But finding out you have a soul mate and living with them seems pretty natural. We havent seen much of Simone at all, or even her house. 

Perhaps the actress has other commitments? But even so if she was important to the story you would think they would work with her. Or at least make her appearances more meaningful? If she couldnt be there but they wanted to show they they are together they could have a scene with Chidi in her house while she is out. 

Also I cant take the credit for this observation: But Chidis paradise in season 1 was a row boat on a lake with his soul mate and French poetry.

But Tahanis original characterization was that she was good at tons of stuff, and only *felt* inferior because Kamila was better at everything. And, in addition, she moved on past that on 2 separate occasions, one when she made up with her sister and one when she confronted her parents. Michael says she already has her memories back so we know she has those experiences.

Additionally, in the earlier episode with the douchey Chad guy, Eleanor plan ends up being to trick him into doing nice things and hope that he ends up naturally changing for the better, and Micheal acts like thats a smart idea because it worked on Eleanor. But again, that seems to conflict with Tahanis characterization, because she spent her whole life doing good things to try and prove to everyone else what a good person she was, and clearly that did NOT make her a good person.

It just seems like the writing has stopped caring about Tahani as a character. She only gets used as a foil to talk up Eleanor as being super awesome. 

Jason similarly has been underdeveloped, but that's a bit more understandable because Jason had always been a fairly static character, for example not passing his test at the end of season 2. It's hard to do as much with a character like Jason other than comedy. Tahani, on the other hand, seemed to show genuine growth I'm both seasons 2 and 3, and I'm just a bit disappointed at how shes closer to Derek in the cast hierarchy than she is to Micheal and Eleanor.",6,20,False,self,,,,,

She's just a braggadocious bourgeoisie &amp; I get that is part of the reason she ended up in the bad place, but the way this character is written really goes out of the way to make her come across as a nuisance to the show. 


Episode 5 of Season 4 somewhat touched on how out of the other 3 main characters, she's had the least development and contributes the least to their current mission. Sure, her task was to help solidify the friendships between the test subjects, but since she's such a drama queen and an attention horse, she couldn't
even follow through on that. I'm going to miss this show once it ends, but I can't say I'll miss Tehani at all and will probably avoid watching anything Jameela is cast in.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

The Derek neighborhood was barely a big deal all that happened was the Janet babies just glitched out and he just had to Derek himself to resolve that issue like rebooting a PC. I guess they already did the whole collapsing neighborhood back in season 2 but that would have been more interesting to watch than this.

Janet spent all that time in the Bad Place and they didn't even get close to getting under her not skin, also Janet is immune to magnets now? Did she get rebooted between season 2 and now? Last I remember Janets should get loopy around magnets but she was holding herself together pretty well. 

I don't think it's a time thing either Bad Janet was cuffed for all of 2 minutes and was loopy, our Janet was in her cell for I assume much much longer yet she wasn't fazed at all unlike season 2 where she couldn't even remember where her infinite void was.

Well that went out the window a while ago, and this week's episode seriously triples down on the Bad Place characters openly referring to themselves as demons. So what gives?

My theory is that it's Michael specifically who takes offense to the word, because it carries the stigma of torture for the sake of torture. As we've since learned, while Michael loves torture, he only loved it because he thought that the people he was torturing deserved it.

It seems tenuous at first, but just stay with me here...

I think Tahani is exactly what God would act like if they decided to try to be a human. Everyone was made in God's image, so everyone should be at God's level or above, which seems to be what Tahani believes/ believed. She is basically living the best life any of us could imagine, she seems perfect, and yet she was/ is constantly surprised when people *don't* enjoy the privilege that she has, which seems like the attitude a God would have.

She also hangs out with all of the people who humanity worships in place of God, celebrities. I think the fact that she only names famous people is (possibly) telling, although it's obviously also just a funny running gag. Like a lot of theories I've read, I think God may have erased their own memory to live among humans, ala Janet and Derek's reset buttons, and it makes sense that God would naturally mingle with the ""Gods"" of our culture while on earth. We worship them, and God would naturally want to know why.

I also noticed that there have been theories about pretty much every other character being God, and it usually seems to be because they each represent some sort of attribute that we all think applies to God. My problem is that most of those focus on the good aspects of God. Chidi is absolutely moral. Jason is innocent and mentally pure in a strange sort of way. Michael and Elanor both want to be good and want others to be good. Janet is only there to help others. Derek is helpful, if insane.

But God needs to change and improve, and because no one gets into the Good Place anymore I think God knows it. God is full of themselves, and thinks that the people on earth aren't as good as her/ him, and that us humans don't deserve to be in the Good Place. God is an elitist. But they finally realized that they needed to change. They realized that they needed to see what it's like to not be as perfect as their creator.

And so Tahani was born.

Her parents, and more importantly her inconceivably perfect sister, are basically what control and guide her life. They're her religion. They are a trinity of (extremely judgemental) beings who everyone adores, and one especially stands out as a being who no one could ever live up to. Someone who is apparently just *perfect*. Tahani-God made a false idol on earth, and she couldn't even live up to that.

Tahani is God finally taking the steps to stop being such an elitist forkhead. By living as a an imperfect product of perfection God will finally be able to understand their own flaws and fix the rating system and The Good Place for our modern humanity.

After S04E05 in particular, it looks to me like they've made a point of showing us how each one has been facing - and overcoming - their old worst traits: 

**Eleanor**: 

On earth she was utterly selfish, incapable of trusting or relying on anyone else, lashed out at anyone who seemed like a better person, and always gave up immediately in the face of any real challenge.   ("" Do you remember once when your change oil light came on? You just abandoned your car in a parking garage."")    

By this point in season four, we've seen her not just agree to sacrifice her relationship with Chidi for the welfare with others, but have to set her own pain aside day after day, selflessly protecting him and the experiment.    She's not just become a part of the team, (impossible in her old life!), but she's become the leader who is holding that team together, and far from giving up as soon as the going gets tough, she's been rising to every challenge thrown at them.  And in place of her old inferiority complex, we've just seen her giving Tahani, her one-time ""better than you"" nemesis, pep talks to affirm *Tahani's* value and importance on the team. 

**Tahani**: 

On earth Tahani's whole motivation was to earn praise and affirmation for herself, and all her charitable acts were basically shallow and selfish.   She was obsessed with status, obsessed with trying to best her sister, and never looked past her own emptiness to see how much others were hurting too.  

By season three, she'd learned real empathy, with her forgiveness of her sister being a huge breakthrough.  This season, she proved that growth was real by finding common ground with John, (once again letting go of her very justified resentment and choosing empathy instead).   Where once she'd agonized over being 'second best,' she's now willingly stepping into a supporting role for the experiment, recognizing and respecting Eleanor's leadership skills.  And now, maybe for the first time in her life, she's recognizing how very shallow her life's pursuits have been, (throwing great parties!  Displaying perfect fashion!  Knowing which spoon to use with festive jellies!).  She's beginning to crave not *affirmation and praise*, but rather a chance to be truly useful and helpful to others.  It will be really interesting to see how this plays out.  On the podcast, Jameela hinted that this will be a major part  of her upcoming story line. 

**Jason:** 

He's always been the sweetest and most selfless of the group, but he had no impulse control.  He never looked farther ahead than the time it took to launch another Molotov cocktail.  He'd also never dedicated himself to anything more meaningful than dance competitions.   

Overall I think his growth has been harder to see so far, BUT he's been quietly doing whatever the group needs of him, and even doing it well.  For Jason, that's a big deal!  He played his role with Chidi flawlessly.  He was the one to suggest to Eleanor that they might need to rein things in, and it was Jason who realized Bad Janet had been sabotaging the team!   Possible biggest break through yet: when he and Michael broke into the Bad Place, Jason *did not default to blowing things up.*  Even with his (not a) girlfriend's freedom on the line, he played his part, held back, and followed instructions.  Sure enough, Jason is learning restraint and focus.  (Just given the shape of the season so far, I do expect more in Jason's arc, but so far so good!) 

**Chidi**: 

Chidi is where it gets tough.  His worst flaw on earth was his crippling indecisiveness, linked to an inability to commit, take risks, or step outside his comfort zone.    With his memory wiped, we're not getting to see the full 'season four growth' version of Chidi right now.  BUT: maybe Chidi has already passed his part of the test.  When he decided to have his mind wiped again, that was a huge, terrifying decision.  He was braver and more decisive than we'd ever seen him.  It was also deeply trusting of him, totally handing over control.   That was a pretty big deal too.  Sure enough, by episode 5, we learn that yes, he really does still trust Eleanor, even if he doesn't remember why.    

&amp;#x200B;

Questions I still have: 

\- How much of the Bad Place sabotage was expected and even intended by the judge?  

\- Where the Here does Brent come into this?   So much of the story has been about redemption, but how will they ever get through to such an actual cockroach?  \[Note: next episode is called ""A Chip Driver Mystery,"" which has GOT to mean we're about to learn more about Brent.\]

1125,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2019-10-27,2019,10,27,9,dnmceb,self.TheGoodPlace,On the powers of Shawn (/Sean/Shaun),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/dnmceb/on_the_powers_of_shawn_seanshaun/,Thisworksiguess7,1572136768,"Shawn (/Sean/Shaun) played by Marc Evan Jackson has been a character since S1E11. He is established as having one power, namely cocooning.

He has shown to be able cocoon himself (S1E12), others in the neighborhood (S2E8), and the people in his boardroom (S3E1). The cocooning is shown to have the ability to incapacitate, at least in the case of Vicky when she was caught midsentence for the entirety of the time between S2E8 and S3E7 (If you wish to dispute whether she was really midsentence, I will cite that in the podcast for S3E7 they say that she was in fact midsentence.)  It is established that, in these cases, he can use this power from a couple feet away. However, this is not unlimited power. In S2E10, Shawn (/Sean/Shaun) would have absolutely wanted to incapacitate Michael or one of the humans but didn't, either due to distance or some other reason.  Also in S4E1, the judge threatens to come down there if he tries to interfere again, so he must not be able to stop the judge with cocooning.

 And now for the reason why I'm making this post. In this past episode S4E5, Michael stood what was looked like only a couple of feet away from Shawn (/Sean/Shaun) with a demon gun. Of course, he was far enough away that he couldn't have just knocked the gun out of his hand, but still closer than Val was when she was cocooned in S3E1. If he could cocoon him, he could have done that while Michael was pointing the gun at Vicky as, worst case scenario Michael shoots Vicky before getting enveloped by the wall of goo. As he didn't, it would follow that, for some reason other than distance, he couldn't cocoon Michael at DemonCon. So, I ask, why not?

To be clear, this is not a plot hole, but rather a world building hole, something that has many plausible explanations but doesn't have one that is established. 

Maybe the neighborhood and the boardroom are just special, but why?

Maybe only can incapacitate in the case of Vicky, but why?

Maybe DemonCon and the Museum of Human Misery are special, but why?

Maybe Shawn (/Sean/Shaun) just didn't want to cocoon, but why not? And why try to get other people to stop them? And what about back in season 2?

All of these explanations, and others, do work but none of them that I've found are based on anything established, or are satisfying.

Is there some obvious established thing I missed? Is one of the explanations I said not as dissatisfying as I said? Or is there some other explanation?",19,4,False,self,,,,,

This is the first post I'm making on this subreddit so forgive me if I make any mistakes.

I just wanted to make this post to share with ya'll about how The Good Place has influenced me.

For a comedy, family-friendly show it really has managed to make a huge impact in my life. I'm actively trying to help people with their problems these days, listening to them and trying to make their day better. I can't pinpoint exactly when it started but I was talking to some people and just came to this realization a while ago.

I also don't know for sure whether it was TGP that has influenced me, but I like to believe that it was. There are so many great quotes about trying to be a better person and making a positive impact in this world and I'm genuinely grateful to Mike Schur and his team for this show. While there are some really hilarious and funny quotes, at times it's just wholesome and gives good tips on how to be good/a better person (some examples):

* Principles arent principles when you pick and choose when youre gonna follow them (S02E10)
* We are not in this alone (S02E13)
* The next time someone asks for help, say yes (S03E01)
* Our fates are sealed. But I think we have one move left: We can try (S03E04)
* I guess all I can do is embrace the pandemonium, find happiness in the unique insanity of being here, now (S03E12)

There are so many more great examples out there and this show is one of my favorites (beaten only by Brooklyn Nine-Nine).

Anyway, I'm just super happy that this show exists and that I've had the pleasure of watching it and being influenced by it to become a better person. Though I'm sad that the show is coming to an end soon, I know that it'll forever hold a special place in my heart -- because of it, I've begun to be a better person. (Not that I was ever an Arizona trash bag but I wasn't exactly perfect either)

Thanks for reading this post and I hope you have a great day!",0,11,False,self,,,,,

In season two when the Judge gave team cockroach a chance to prove they were good enough for the good place, the only one who had actually improved enough to go was Eleanor, and shes truly been the driving force for helping her friends improve throughout the series.

So I think that the real subjects of the experiment are the original humans. So far they have already shown massive improvement from who they were and theres been very little focus on the new humans, and way more on the teams interactions with them and everything theyre doing behind the scenes.

 Chidi was able to make a truly impossible decision, without a stomach ache, to sacrifice his memories for the greater good of humanity. 

Jason controlled his impulses in the bad place in order to save Janet and return her to the neighborhood for the good of everyone. 

And Im certain well see some kind of incredible improvement from Tahani in the coming episodes. 

So their improvements alone will prove that people can change for the better when given the chance, even though its taken hundreds of years since their original deaths to change what made them bad in the first place.",14,97,False,spoiler,,,,,

PLEASE DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'RE LIKE CHIDI AND CAN APPRECIATE TWISTS AND TURNS ON THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT.

Hey guys. I can't sleep. I think about this everyday.

I know a ""shirtpost"" flair would imply this to not be a serious topic, but it'd be inappropriate to put it as ""no spoiler"" or even simply blank.

Here's the question:
How are people who died of suicide admitted into the afterlife?

To clarify the sort of answers that I'm predicting you'll have answers about, some follow-up:
Perhaps based on the consequences solely? The reasons they did it? The degree of pain they were trying to escape? Based on the actions only up to the moment the thought enters?

What if it was a person who experiences such existential anxiety they decide to end life abruptly?
Maybe it's someone who has never intentionally hurt other people, but nonetheless feel a crippling fear of the uncertainty that will come to mankind if we do not ""shape up"" the way we think The Good Place and its show have thus far convinced us what it expects us to do in response to its existence. 

In other words, the show exists to break the bad news to us that we currently suck as humans and need to improve. Either that or it's another one of those attention seeking shows that just happened to exploit a very enlightening topic. But it's okay to be both - the show seeks attention in a good way.

Actions aren't intrinsically wrong, it's typically motivation or context that will help us truly and fairly judge an event. Moral particularism - in some situations, doing something you think is normally good can be bad only given the exact situation and vice versa.

So what if someone did it as a message?
I understand this is very controversial, so please if this bothers you, I recommend you look at a different thread, and keep comments respectful to one another. I don't mind if you guys have to be critical towards this post, this is my very first post and I just signed up 10 minutes ago while on my 4th rewatch of the whole series including up to what's on NBC of season 4.

People with opposing opinions, I dare ask that you please, if you could, respectfully and actively evaluate what reasons you have for those opinions and what coincides with your opponent in the argument.
Find similarities in your reasoning. Then work together to find more similarities in lines of reasoning and more and more until a new organically grown idea has emerged.
You have to build things together.

We cannot do things alone. There is a reason humans are especially social - it is all to help create a higher power - no not the traditional God you're thinking of - it could eventually be the birth of what we could say is a higher level entity, a deity even. I describe this as being in the same vain that as organ cells in your body are discrete to each other just as macroscopic people are ""different"" from other people. That you are you, and I'm me. But we are us. All of us. Even in the phrase ""we are us"" there are two ways to describe the same entity (at least in English).
This is a coincidental tidbit slightly related to the idea that a group has more properties than the sum of its parts - that corporate-zombie-abused term ""synergy"".

I just wish people could see that there's so much more to this show than just our favorite characters bonding. You know that feeling when your favorite sitcom characters are all becoming best friends for literally all of eternity? That's what I feel from watching this, but it's only so temporary. The only way to truly feel it all the time is to be best friends with everyone else you see, and to encourage them to also make everyone THEIR best friends. Then we could all be, essentially... voyeurs of happy people.

In the words of Bo Burnham from his comedic but existentially terrifying song ""God's Perspective"":

You pray so badly for heaven
Knowing any day might be the day that you die
But maybe life on earth could be heaven
Doesn't just the thought of it make it worth a try?

Can't we try to make each other happy? What true gain do we get in the end for making an enemy?
Whether or not there will be ""more"" after life, why spoil now for somebody else?
How would you feel if someone ruined your life because they didn't think you mattered?
Maybe in your head you think ""I'm not that person so I don't care"", or maybe you think ""Of course I'd feel upset so I would treat others as they treat me""

That's moral desert - the idea that describes you only do good because you think someone else deserves it or you only experience bad things when you do bad things.

Sadly, life is apparently random - that we shouldn't leave how we treat each other up to chance, to put the blame on the laws of nature or physics. That the first step in truly being a good person is to simply take the initiative to act for the betterment of everyone - while sufficiently prioritizing one's own survival - not so much it seems to be selfish self preservation, and not so little it is at one's own expense which would be a waste of moral inertia in a sea of emotionally developing humans.

We are so privileged now to, for the majority, disregard the primitive fears of being eaten by wild animals or of starving to death (as far as I know in the US, there are shelters specifically out there to feed you at the very least if you cannot even afford food, so food is not 100% impossible in poverty). It's actually hard to die here - it's even outlawed - killing yourself is bad for the population, based on the need to essentially forbid it.
So we don't have to worry about physical dangers - now we need to sharpen our emotional skills.

So why don't we all take this time to realize with the technological advances in all of the recent century, and with our growing numbers, we can be so much more powerful and happy if we all just worked together? If we all just made it so much easier to live together?
Why can't we just stop forking it up for somebody else, or even if we do to at least try to amend?
Humans fork up, but it's DECIDING to let it get buried to never be appropriately acknowledged can be an issue.

We need to understand bad things happen. And its frequency does not define whether we're good or bad - you can't blame anything or anybody. You just have to be willing to work to find a solution. That should be rewarding in of itself.

To know that you had the ability to overcome. To speak up in the world, to take the first step, to be the leader.

Anyhow I'm rambling.

""I thought to myself, Well, those people are smoking, they already dont care about their lives, and I ran at them with the bees,"" she said. But it shows you that Im going straight to The Bad Place, doesnt it?""

I was about five minutes in, at the point when Michael is walking through the neighborhood with Eleanor, reciting the list of people who did and did not get into the Good Place. And I noticed that Michael says that Lincoln got into the Good Place. Now, Lincoln died in 1865, which was 151 years before 2016, when The Good Place season 1 first aired. But later in the show we find out that no one has gotten into the Good Place for the last 500 years. This directly contradicts Lincoln's date of death, as previously stated.

Now, after all that scientific language, here is my theory, which is totally random and utterly insignificant. We know that the Good Place's structure of time is not linear like Earth's, and that it is shaped somewhat like the words Jeremy Bearimy, which loop and curl back on itself so that time in the Good Place doesn't always match that of Earth. Therefore, the Good Place, although seemingly making use of various modern references and things, often takes place in the past or the future rather than the present. So when Michael says that no one has gotten into the Good Place in 500 years, the time in the Good Place was in the far future, since Lincoln only died 151 years ago. 

The time jumps around so much that when Judge Gen goes down to Earth, we have no idea what she finds there, because it could have been any time at all. Who knows, maybe the whole experiment with the four humans is based on data from 400 BC or 3019 AD. The time on Earth doesn't have to match the time in the Good Place.

When we are introduced to her we are told the Bad Place and the Good Place battled over her. But when we saw the Good Place folks they were pretty indifferent and not at all concerned that no one had entered in centuries. Beyond that it takes them forever to even make a decision about making a decision. But they chose to advocate for Mindy and then did so in less than 30 Earth years (she died in the late 80s and had clearly been living alone for quite some time.)

And I know people will say Jeremy Bearimy. But then that means that what the Good Place Committee suggested to Michael wasn't *actually* that egregious. Their after-world timeline of decision making did not relate to Earth years. Meaning it didn't mean centuries more of all humans being sent to the Bad Place. It could be minutes or months for humanity. Just as I'm sure it took a long time to decide to fight for Mindy and then do so but it wasn't that crazy long in Earth years.

Given the Jeremy Bearimy of it all, we could conceivably meet a grown up (even very old) version of Patty. We've been shown time and time again Eleanor's crummy upbringing directly affected her behaviour as an adult and, back in Chapter 33 (S03E07) when we met Patty, Donna professed her desire to try and be a better parent and role model - and what if she succeeded? 

I think this would be an interesting bookend to demonstrate how much Eleanor has grown over the course of the show to help others become better vs how someone as (initially) dreadful as Donna could also help raise a ""good"" person (assuming that Patty is a beneficiary of some sort of revised afterlife system and is destined for the purgatory or even the good place.)

Working backwards, in S3:E8 when he and Janet visit Doug Forcett, Doug gives him a glass of water, which he notes has an unusual taste. During his second sip, Doug explains that it's purified water from his composting toilet, and a disgusted Michael let's the sip of water dribble out of his mouth back in to the cup. A demon would not have been disgusted by this idea, as demonstrated in season 4 by the disgusting dinner choices in the conference room in ""The Selection"" clips, and Glen's request for a glass of hot pig urine after defecting.

I think Michael is inherently not a demon.

The question is, was he ever a demon to begin with?

Maybe. In S2:E2, in one of the reboots, the neighborhood has a sushi cart with a dead tentacled creature hanging from it. In season 4 Michael says his true form is a giant fire squid and the the dead creature could have been symbolic of the death of demon Michael as he begins to realize that bad humans can change.

But there is still the possibility that he was always an angel. We don't actually have any evidence that he was ever a demon to begin as opposed to a secret angel agent who has had his memory erased. In season 2, when Shawn asks Michael how he stole a Good Janet, Michael say that he was able to just walk in to the Good Janet warehouse in the neutral zone, because the Good Place angels were too trusting and stupid to lock doors. 

But we know from Season 3, when the group ends up in the real Good Place mail room, that they actually do lock their doors, as we are told that the door from the mail room to the real Good Place won't open for humans and humans must use a different entrance. If it won't open for humans, it stands to reason that it wouldn't open for demons either, but probably opens for all angels, not just Gwendolyn. 

Maybe, the door to the Good Janet warehouse was locked and unlocked for Michael because he actually is and always has been an angel.

Also, in season 2 when the Bad Place crew arrived, he seemed put off by the fact that the pizza they brought was all Hawaiian.",24,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

But this season has been weak. I dont think Ive laughed out loud more than once. The motivations feel hollow and the new characters are one-dimensional and kind of annoying. They dont have chemistry with the original cast, and the core four (Eleanor Chidi Manny and Tahani) are split up too much to give me the chemistry that made previous seasons work.

Also, the episodes feel too chopped to the bone. The starts of a few of them have seemed to have jumped ahead from the previous episodes ending, to the point where twice now Ive started an episode and gone back to the one before it, thinking I must have missed something.

Ergo, no need for a new Good Janet for that long.

my little babble below is mostly for those who have seen a majority of the show or those who don't mind vague recalls of major plot points in a show they kind of watch, i appreciate both of you, and everyone who reads

Hopefully you like VSauce or seemingly nonsensical but actually later enlightening shirt because this is the best YouTube original licensed show I've ever watched and it's free to view until the end of the year, I've been binge watching it for hours and it's now 4:56am and now I want to study how to rage against machines and start a social revolution lol

You guys, since Michael once compared humans to cockroaches... and he's now trying to steer them in the right direction, what if roboroaches are the controversial neurology milestone that would eventually become the seed for psychological tools we can develop to help human beings learn to be morally good people through the use of electric neural stimulation?

Ethically, there are concerns of manipulating another living being, such as cockroaches, no matter how insignificant the creature. What if that's what will eventually happen to us?

then again these are two very unrelated pieces of media that I'm connecting because i'm crazy and try to apply what i learn from TGP into other things that exist

After all, you never know if there's a parallel universe where it functions on Jearimy Bearimy AND there's a universe within that universe where our timeline exists and that that show might actually be exactly what The Good Place universe looks like

Our Janet has only been rebooted 800 times, which up until this season was thought to be a ridiculous/intense amount of upgrades to go through.

Still, I'd argue that while Derek/Bad Janet have received physical (Derek) or ability (Bad Janet) upgrades that might exceed Janet's, she's still the most advanced out of the three. Why? She spent time on earth. There are three main reasons I think this gives her the advantage:

1) On earth, Janet's information wasn't updating. But, she also wasn't bound by the same restraints which she was in the afterlife. When they head to the Bad Place HQ towards the end of Season 2, Janet is initially unable to decline requests (although she advances enough to imitate Bad Janet in the next episode). On earth, Janet doesn't have to respond to anyone. She has autonomy in a way that neither Derek nor Bad Janet has ever experienced. After returning from earth, this seems to have stuck. She has ideas for the neighborhood, and confesses to Eleanor in Pandemonium the value in not  knowing.

2) Janet also says in ""Best Self"" that her operating system is constantly updating. This means that all of the time she spent on earth still gives her new abilities, even if she hasn't been rebooted. Rebooting Derek/Bad Janet seems to have diminishing returns; after half a million reboots, Derek still has only ""almost"" a fully functioning penis. Without new stimuli to respond to, there is no ability for either of them to really evolve. For this reason, I think at a certain point Bad Janet's reboots plateaued out. If Good Janet could imitate Bad Janet/Neutral Janet/make 300 people after 800 reboots, what further benefits come in the next four million? 

3) Janet says in ""Derek"" that she doesn't really experience the passage of time but ""does use it as a lotion occasionally"". On earth, Janet spent roughly a year experiencing time. Reapply the second argument that having a new experience to build off of gives her the ability to generate new abilities later on.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Janet is more advanced than Derek or Bad Janet, despite having rebooted less times, because she spent time on Earth.",10,28,False,self,,,,,

1279,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2019-10-31,2019,10,31,10,dpgc0a,self.TheGoodPlace,Hints about Chidi's real identity?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/dpgc0a/hints_about_chidis_real_identity/,HistoryHasItsEyes,1572484740,"I am not convinced that Chidi is who he says he is, and I am thinking that the next twist might be concerning his identity. Is he God? Is he the boss demon? Or is he Eleanor's little subconscious voice that tells her what she is doing wrong, something akin to the Holy Spirit? 

&amp;#x200B;

1. His name, Chidi translates to 'God exists' but more literally to 'God is here' (in this location, it is a positional word).
2. His last name, Anagonye, can be broken up in the following way, from igbo: ""ana"", the ground, ""go"", to make, and ""nye"", for. Is he the Maker/Creator Of Earth? (according to a bit of research, the direct translation would be ""Maker Of The Ground For You"".) Is he an architect, an angel who is supposed to ""make"" Eleanor's foundation, to help her find her way? 
3. Is the fact that he's mistaken for Trent in The Bad Place significant? I'm not quite sure that was just for comic effect and to add drama - we thought kicking the puppy in the sky was for comic effect, and it wasn't. We thought Michael torturing the characters was the usual sitcom-like blundery to make us laugh, and it wasn't. If Chidi is Trent, does he assume different roles throughout time and outside of it, for different people?
4. His backstory - unlike other characters, we see him interacting with people from his past, but no true in-depth backstory. Why would a child be reciting philosophical quandaries on the playground and already know so much? Is he clever, or is he more than just a kid in that memory (or as old as time)?
5.  Chidi is the first character Eleanor meets who comes \*to\* her, she does not go to him first. He knows that the language he speaks is translated to English and seems to have a good grasp of the intricacy of things in the Good Place.
6. Most of what we hear about Chidi's life comes from him telling Eleanor about himself - there is a parallel to Michael, as much of what we knew about Michael's life came from himself (before the big reveal).
7. Chidi is the group's ethical voice, always in pursuit of the fundamental truths of the universe and his focus outwardly is on truth, goodness, utility (but not mindless utilitarianism), etc. Is his job as a philosopher a cover because this is his true focus, due to the nature of his being? Or is he evil, and using this as a means to bring the group pain as well as knowledge? He keeps building Eleanor into someone better, but also someone who believes in things, but he also consistently takes them away and causes her pain - is the pain to grow? To torture? 

Have you noticed anything else about him that could be a hint?",16,18,False,spoiler,,,,,
