Therefore, by doing all of these things they are actually making progress to the good place.

I've always loved Jason, though, because he does represent a subset of the city and Florida in general.  This is a story about that subset.  This may be too show unrelated, if so, I understand the delete.

I lived in an area called San Marco, it was pretty walkable (rare for Jacksonville) and had good restaurants and bars.  My apartment was the converted second floor of a house by a small park on the river.  Next door there was a rowdy house full of party folks who generally had a late night schedule and lots of people over pretty regularly throughout the week.

I was about to leave for work one day in August when I noticed something strange in the side yard.

It was a dead adult alligator with some of the skin removed.  Not a lot, but the easy part to remove (around the joints).  It was weird.  Also, gross.  Also dead thing outside in August?

When I arrived home, the corpse was still in the yard.  It did not smell great.

One of my neighbors was outside.  I query the gator origin story.  Here is his tale:

""We were getting high and having a few beers in the driveway last night when these two redneck meth heads pulled up in front of the park in a pickup truck.

They snorted some and went into the bed of the truck and dragged something large and heavy out.  We went over to see what it was.

The meth heads yelled ""LEAVE IT ITS THE COPS"", dropped the large heavy thing, and sped off.

We thought it might be a body but were STOKED because it was an alligator, and, like, it'd be super cool to have an alligator skeleton or at LEAST a skeleton head.""

I need to point out here that just about every gas station near a highway in Florida has alligator skeleton heads.  They cost about $12 for a smallish one.

I mentioned the very, very questionable legality of this, the health concerns I had, and the general fact of what happens to corpses in the heat along with the interesting fauna that may appear due to said corpse.  Also the smell, which was already nasty.

That was Day 1.

Day 2 the smell was worse, and the torso....exploded.  The smell at this point was unbearable, and the neighbors were attempting to cut the head off the alligator with a cheap kitchen knife.  This was not successful.

Day 3 the bugs in the area were thick, the smell was tear inducing (I stayed at someone else's house that night), and the neighbors mentioned that they weren't sure they would be able to get the head off and were thinking about selling it.

""Someone might want the meat, or maybe they want the skeleton.""

SOMEONE MIGHT WANT THE MEAT.

At this point I called the garbage service who sent me to the right group to remove the corpse.

And if this story had ended with my neighbor throwing a molotov cocktail into a boat, it couldn't be more Jacksonville.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

His openness and willingness to dispense helpful advice just seems uncharacteristic imo. Of course he's actively been trying to change and do good deeds, but I wish we would get more glimpses of his instinctive urge to torture he's acted on for his entire existence up until now.

&amp;#x200B;

What made the series special to me is that it goes over and beyond what a normal sitcom would do. The show's concept already lends itself for creative storytelling. But every episode takes it a step further and despite the episodic nature, each one is a tight adventure and exploration of the characters and the human psyche in general.

&amp;#x200B;

In season 3 however,  our favorite demon and our favorite Janet are stripped off of their powers and everyone is on earth. It feels as if the earth setting grounds the group and by extension, the creativity to tell unique stories. I know it's only been a couple so far, but I'm not too fond of the monster of the week kind of episodes---in which monsters are the inner demons of the characters and the gang help their loved ones be better people. It's the first time I felt that the episodic nature of the show offputting.

&amp;#x200B;

And because of the grounded setting, it feels as if the show blends into the pack of numerous nameless sitcoms. There are moments where it feels like the show temporarily loses the things that made it special in the first place. Instead of a complex exploration of the character dynamics and human nature, it's become help other people be good. My personal issue is with the manner in which the episodic monster of the week stories play out. Not in the most literal sense, but you can replace the actors and put it as an episode of any other sitcom. And you can't say the same with the past seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I have unhealthy high expectations for the show. I totally understand that not every episode is going to be equally as good as the others. And I'm fully aware that everything could go off the walls at the turn of a dime. And I'm all for it. All I'm saying is that, at the moment, it feels like it's been a dry first half of the season.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the current episodes, they're still funny and the characters are still the dysfunctional bunch that we've learned to love. It's just that I personally don't enjoy the first episodes of this season as much as I have the first two seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I made this post in an attempt to offer a constructive criticism (not really a criticism, just an observation) and I'd like to make the point that I'm not just hating for no reason. I just wanted to throw my personal opinions out there and genuinely wondering if other people feel the same.",9,1,False,self,,,,,

Throughout my life, I try to make an effort to be open with people and be interested in my friends and sympathetic to their struggles, but so many people are reticent to even question their own reactionary responses to things, let alone talk honestly about their problems with others. Especially when it causes conflict with someone, in the UK at least the primary response is just to close up or laugh it off or get defensive about it or just straight up cut contact and never talk about it or them again.

It seems like sometimes there's absolutely no social responsibility now. People are hiding behind ""don't judge"" and other such crap and using it to become indignant when anyone even remotely acknowledges a flaw in someone's personality, even in a supportive and encouraging way, even if that behaviour damages people they become close to and causes them emotional pain, that's *their* problem, and they should just get over it and drink more. Feels like classic Shellstrop moves on a wider scale.

Everyone uses Facebook and other social media as a way to isolate themselves from society while pick and choosing the bits of it they want to take part in, and never forming lasting bonds with new friends because the people they're around changes so often. Their ""friends"" are measured by the amount of likes on a post and the comments beneath. Not the people that are actually there for them, to provide real support and friendship, to have fun and make time for, to grow close to and grow better with.

As someone who ""saw Facebook coming"" and never signed up for an account (though I'm sure they have several shadow profiles on me already) and doesn't use their services where possible, it's left me and the few friends like me I've managed to find along the way in a very difficult position when it comes to expanding our own social circles.

It's heartening to see a show that not only leaps head first into those meaningful interactions but has the characters respond from a place of genuine humanity and consideration for others too. Here's hoping it catches on again as people start to realise what a danger Facebook is posing not only to society but to the mental health of those susceptible to it's influences (advertising, fake news, etc) as well.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Like, if they all lived to age 80 or so, then the show would either need to show it (doubtful) or skip ahead to their deaths and re-awakening in the afterlife. The latter would mean that wed deal with very different people than the ones we were introduced to.

See, I have faith in the show. In the first season I didn't, so I thought the post-Elanor-reveal episodes were tone deaf considering the ""good people"" were utterly unsympathetic to Elanor possibly being sent to the Bad Place. These last two episodes feel exactly as tone deaf, given what we know about the points system. And so they need people to go through the motions, get their hearts ripped out when something let's them know none of their friends and relatives have any real chance to get into the Good Place, that will finally, FINALLY trigger the Rage Against the Heavens just about everyone in the audience has been waiting for since the first episode.

What if this season is more about acceptance, the final stage of grief? So far they've met the people that had the major influence on each of them in life and made peace with that person rather than correct them. The next step is to finally move on and break the cycle. No more of Tahani craving attention because she's not alone, her sister is in the same boat as she was in and didn't even realize that. Eleanor's famous line ""The only person I trust is me!"" is wrong because the cause of that mistrust is genuinely trying to be better, to be reliable. 


I think the rest of the show is them learning something new rather than correcting their flaws. Eleanor learns to trust others. Jason when to let go of lost causes (god knows that lack of impulse control is why we love him). Tahani that not every little things is a competition. My guess with Chidi is that mistakes are fine, make them and move on.


Season two focused on the flaws in each of their characters and this show is so good because it keeps changing things up. It would be odd to harp on the flaws AGAIN with the judge. It would be interesting though if the tests were designed to see the improvements and if the new things they've learned took. What do you think?  ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

In it, they have an 'aspiring angel' who is unable to get to heaven, but is assigned to be an advocate for the deceased person.  The deceased person is then sent to go back in time to the point where things could've changed for them where they can make better decisions.  Other than that I barely remember the episodes but there is a judge at the beginning of each episode and the advocate (the aspiring angel) who helps the person and sometimes other people during the episode.

&amp;#x200B;

If Michael and the team can convince the Judge and the other higher-ups to make changes it's possible that there may be a future 'advocate for the deceased' and maybe 'scenario neighbourhoods if they had a do-over'.  Where they would play out if the person can change themselves to make good decisions in the afterlife and thereby get into The Good Place.  I don't think this experiment will happen on actual Earth again, but maybe in a new neighbourhood designed specifically to test individuals after some soul-searching about their life?

I was really excited to watch the new episode after seeing that part of it will take place in my home country (Hungary).

I was surprised to see that there were some Hungarian texts and spoken lines in there as well, so I decided to give a quick run-down of what they really mean.

First, the text on the museum. The only part in hungarian was ""A fontos mvszeti mzeum"", which translates to ""The important museum of arts"", which doesn't really make sense.

Next, we hear a few spoken words (with horrible, horrible accents). These are ""Tipikus Tahani"" , ""s miutn Kamilah megmentette az lett?"" and ""Milyen ruls!"" which translate almost exactly to the subtitles. Then comes chidi, with ""Nvrek?"" , which does mean sisters, but nvrek by itself is the plural form of older sister, since hungarian differentiates between older and younger siblings. Chidi also says ""Igaz?"". This is used as ""Am I right?"" in conversations, but the word igaz simply means true.

Later on, the same two guys have these lines: ""Tojs a tojson! Zseni!"" and ""Kamilah megint megtette!"". They are translated pretty well, but Kamilah megint megtette sounds really weird, and I don't think any hungarian person would say that in real life.

The next instance is also the two hipster art lovers who constantly butcher the pronounciations. ""Engedi el ket!"" is just plain wrong. The correct order would be ""Elengedi ket!"" , meaning she is letting them go. "", milyen kedves ez a Kamilah"" also doesn't mean ""Oh, how merciful is Kamilah!"", but ""Oh, how nice is this Kamilah!"". 

These were all the instances I could notice. My opinion is that there are some weird translations, and the actors who portrayed the hungarians were definitely not native speakers, they were really really bad. But I appriciate the fact that the writers included them in the episode, it's really exciting to hear your globally insignificant language in an international series.

I hope my writing is not too long, and I could provide some useful information to others watching the show.",13,1,False,self,,,,,

My theory is that theyll be allowed to stay on earth with a sort of guardian-angel type of role, meaning they dont get to be in the Good Place, because they werent good enough for it, but they get to be together in a medium place and continue improving as people while also assisting the broken system that determined their fates for the afterlife. Also Michael could fit a good judge or leader role for these determinations as he has roots in the Bad Place and understands it, but also has ethical perspective on the other side. 

I just think itd be cool if they continued their adventures in influencing the world and the system for the afterlife, since they are improving but likely wouldnt be satisfied just being zapped to the Good Place

tl;dr Earth can be their medium place and they can have a newly built role in the scheme of the afterlife to give people a push in the right direction ",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, and though we don't know what she's like as a lover, 'confident' and 'selfish' are two words that perfectly describe not only Eleanor's mother, but Eleanor herself. And, not knowing what he wants is a perfect description for Chidi as well.

Were supposed to be seeing the humans become better people, but out of everyone Michael has had the most drastic change. 

What if Michael was some sort of controlling asshole boss on earth at an architecture firm, and he gets sent to the bad place. His punishment is thinking he is an all powerful demon who tries to torture 4 humans but cant get it right, and these 4 simple humans somehow keep foiling all of his plans, making him infinitely more broken down and tormented than he is.

Now my thoughts are all jumbled and Ill probably try to clean this up later because Im finally trying to write my ideas sporadically, but I also feel like this could be a test for him instead to see if he can become good, and maybe Team Cockroach are like his guardian angels in his corner. 

The connection to this episode was when Eleanor said something along the lines of What if theres higher level demons above you determining what you do? This show loves to throw in little hints that seem kind of inconsequential, like Jason thinking theyre in a prank show and being the most right so far, and the quick nod to Doug Forcett this episode and them most likely going to see him in the end.

Everything we saw in this episode that happened after Eleanor first put on the earplugs was a simulation.

Her baldness and hair regrowth was part of a simulation, both the library and burger joint were part of a simulation, the memories were happening in a nested simulation. Michael is using Janet's simulation machine to feed Eleanor information, and it's likely that some of it is false information.

&amp;#x200B;

Hints that this might be true:

Hair and teeth don't grow back within 20 minutes in the real world, no matter how many bananas you eat.

Michael was wearing a similar outfit in the Soulmates Aren't Real Ya Dingus scene as he did in the library. Except for the cuffs (the bowtie doesn't count), and that one difference was specifically pointed out to us. Almost like Mike Schur knew that we might suspect this memory wasn't real, and was adressing that...

Janet once asked ""Why is it that everytime something new is invented, humans immediately try to use it for porn?"" when Eleanor wanted to use the simulation machine. Both the library and the burger joint - the latter of which was referred to in the podcast by  Marc Evan Jackson as a ""cafe"", so maybe he got it ""confused"" with the cafe Chidi practised his breakup in (if I'm right and if you are reading this, Marc: try to be subtler next time) - are used to shoot porn.

Anyways, I just wanted to address a couple issues that I've seen in a lot with people's posts:

 - This season sucks because Earth is boring compared to the afterlife!!!

I'm assuming this was meant to be the plan, since the show was pitched to last 5 seasons. The fantasy and world building of the afterlife segued into their getting a second chance on earth, which is mundane and boring because we all live here (assumedly). Of course it's not going to be as entertaining as giraffes running around and shrimp flying through the air while Ariana Grande plays in the background.

 - Why did we have to go to Earth? This show has become so boring now!!!

We have determined through the show that the humans can't accrue good place points in the afterlife because of corrupt motivations, so how were we supposed to continue the story from here? Despite the crazy twists and turns, everything so far has felt like logical continuation in my opinion. Placing them back on Earth not only gives us a ""different"" world to explore, but also allows us to see the characters grow and develop outside of corrupt motivations and constant rebooting.

 - Why have we spent so much time on Earth? I want to see more of the afterlife!!!

Again, this ties into the last point. The humans have to learn and grow as individuals outside of the afterlife. If the first episode jumped ahead 5 years later and all of the sudden we got quick exposition on how they decided to become ""virtuous for virtue's sake"" and they're all perfect now, it would've felt cheap and dissatisfying. I guarantee once the entire season is on Netflix, it will be just as bingeable as the first two seasons.

 - Ugghh, this show has lost its creativity and direction!!!

Absolutely not. The entire world that Shur has created still exists, we're just not back there because we have to move the chess pieces around a little bit so the story can move forward. There is a master plan for 5 seasons and if you give up on it now, you'll be left with a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion upon its cancellation. Literally, think of all the story left to be discovered... Are their points now accruing again? What will happen now that the demons are on earth? Will they get to the Good Place? What is actually in the Good Place? Who can actually make it to there? Where will we go from there when we find out? Will Eleanor and Tahani finally get together? 

This story has a clear ending that Shur has devised and he's already clued Kristen Bell into it. Just don't give up on a story because a couple chapters are boring to you. If you liked the first two seasons, at least give it a chance to get back to where you're wanting it to go... delayed gratification turns out to be sweeter than instant.",16,1,False,self,,,,,

**Kamilah:** Not that I'd expect you to understand, but it's a commentary on the world's fascination with subservience, consumption, death, and pedagogy.

I've spent some time thinking about Kamilah and her damn exhibit. Credit to my partner for pointing out the possibility of seeing Kamilah's commentary as a lens through which to view the entire show.

On the surface level, Kamilah's self-importance is the joke. Of course she would describe her performance art in this really condescending and meaningless way. Yet, just because it's a grandiose way to describe someone cooking omelets in an art museum, doesn't mean Kamilah's wrong. The more I've thought about these four wordssubservience, consumption, death, and pedagogythe more that they hold meaning, not only for Kamilah's exhibit but for the show has a show. You could make a case that those four concepts make up a significant portion of the show's major themes.

**PART 2 - KAMILAH'S EXHIBIT**

These themes apply clearly to Kamilah's exhibit. But just to make sure, let's think through them.

**Subservience:** By producing an omelet to order for the guests, Kamilah puts visitors to the museum into the position of receiving a personal favor from someone who is (in this universe) a mega celebrity. Kamilah is a powerful, influential, person, but here she is in a position to take orders from any rando with the resources to go to this museum and attend her public performance. Yet, even though she is in a position to temporarily be ""subservient"" to the guests, she has the power to choose to stop at any timewhich she does, when she refuses to continue after Tahani won't take an omelet from her. In a more meta sense, Kamilah is dependent upon the people presentart critics, etcwho will analyze her work and enable her to pose her performance as high art. Yet, they are also themselves dependent on her as the artist to create the situation that allows them to share in this meaning-making. By writing this long-ass essay about it, I'm also basically doing this. Weird.

**Consumption:** A very literal reading is that the omelet is something that people can eat/consume. It's also perishableits only purpose is to be consumed, and if it isn't, it will be wasted. In a similar way, the art exhibit is a temporary performance meant to be consumed by the audience. The performance itself is perishable because it depends on Kamilah's presence/willingness to perform it.

**Death:** Weirdly, this is probably the most relevant to the show but the least relevant to her exhibit. At any rate, the death is the interruption of the chicken's life cyclethe sacrifice of an egg, which could produce new life but instead is consumed. Along with the bacon and whatever other things she wants to put in there.

**Pedagogy:** If pedagogy is about teaching methods/practices, Kamilah's performance is pedagogy because by watching her, a viewer may learn the techniques/skills of creating an omelet by seeing her do so right in front of them. Like any teaching method, it depends on the willing engagement of the student as well. Someone could just as easily receive their omelet while learning nothing, because they weren't thinking about the exhibit as instructive, but instead as a means to a celebrity-crafted meal.

**PART 3 - THE SHOW**

**Subservience:** The show explores the theme of subservience primarily through the characters Janet and Bad Janet. I see her character as funny, adorable, and wonderful of course. But you can easily read a critique of a service mentality into the character. The Janet that we know and love is presented as an ideal servant. She not only completes any request that you have of her to the best of her ability, but she wants to do so. In this way, she's a lot like the House Elves (minus Dobby) in Harry Potter. When Janet has to fake being bad, she suffers because she is programmed to want to help and being anything other than nice is emotionally difficult for her (at least at this time). As the series progresses, though, our Janet becomes more woke and starts to explore desires and wants beyond her programming. Important to this conversation as well as Bad Janet. Consider the following exchange:

**Michael:** Bad Janet, uh, where is the nearest caf? 

**Bad Janet:** Oh, um, that's a good question. It's up your mom's butt, you fat dink.

**Tahani:** What is even the purpose of a Janet who behaves in such a manner? 

I find this interesting for a few reasons. Even though we tend to refer to our Janet as ""good Janet,"" summoning her never requires you to specify this. It's just Janetand there she is. To make Bad Janet show up, you have to specify that you mean Bad Janet. This means that Good Janet is the functional, normal, assumed default, against which Bad Janet is abnormal and defective. Good Janet grows and changes, but Bad Janet is always broken, and never useful. Tahani's question raises the point of subserviencewhat is the purpose of a servant who refuses to serve? Michael forces Bad Janets to kill themselves multiple times by forcing them to pretend to be nice. (I use the term ""kill"" here loosely... it is Janet, after all). And when Shawn tells Bad Janet to scan the neighborhood, she has no choice but to comply. And while our Janet can grow and change, Bad Janet can't. The mere act of trying to grow into someone better causes her to melt. The theme of subservience also connects to notions of free will. Often, the characters on the show treat Janets as objects. And Janet has internalized this as well, referring to herself as luggage. But, through the show, we've seen our Janet learn, grow, and change. And though this isn't Westworld, there's something really compelling about seeing her arrive at something approximating personhood. Like Dobby, the servant we know best (our Janet) is the most radical. Yet, who's to say whether self-sacrifices for either of these characters are truly free will, or an artifact of their internalized attitude of subservience? 

**Consumption:** Though I wouldn't say this is a huge aspect of the show, there are definitely a lot of elements that could be interpreted through the lens of consumption. The first, most direct example, is Eleanor's behavior, especially in the moments leading up to her death. The emptiness of her existence is seen through her wandering through the grocery store knocking all kinds of random shit into her shopping cart. The ""lightly expired buzzer beater shrimp"" and ""Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters"" magazine are great examples of this. Similarly to how people argue that the mall setting for Dawn of the Dead is really about mindless consumption (thematically tied to similarly mindless consumers: zombies), the setting here is used as a shorthand for Eleanor's selfish, apparently meaningless existence. This is reinforced with Chidi's similar shopping trip in Australia, which calls back to this moment. Another example of consumption in the show is Michael's fascination with the useless crap that humans make and use (like a giant novelty pencil that says ""Lordy, Lordy, I'm over 40""; or the honorary human kit that team cockroach gives them). When he describes visiting a Lenscrafters as being ""touristy,"" he's really de-normalizing the material things around us by inviting us to observe the absurdity of it all. And as a fan of this show and the podcast and everything to do with it, I find myself in a deeply consumptive relationship to the show. I crave its content, and all of what it has to say, in the hopes that it, too, might help me find meaning. 

**Death:** The entire point of the show. I don't feel like I have to go into this much. But I will say I find it interesting that for a show about death, a lot of work goes into the writing to distance us from a deep consideration of death. Everything is so stylized, surreal, and funnyeven on earthand with deaths being reversed and the afterlives, death doesn't have the same stakes that it might otherwise have. In effect, the show provides a safe space to think about death without really thinking about death. I'd argue that is the function of a lot of media and philosophyto give us ways of thinking about concepts that are more abstract, and therefore safer, than the actual material consequences of death. Even the closest we get to thisMichael's existential crisis, and Chidi's peep chili trainwreckstill embed the points in so much humor that we aren't left with a deep feeling of dread.

**Pedagogy:** This is an explicit focus of the show. In direct terms, Chidi is teaching ethics to Eleanor (and everyone else). He uses a strategy of lectures, assigning readingsprofessor stuff, basicallythat sometimes work but often doesn't (at least during the reboots). In a more meta sense, though, the show is engaged in a pedagogy of teaching us how to be a good person, by again embedding the education in a digestible format. Just reading wiki pages on these philosophical points is probably bad pedagogy. But because of the humor of the show, I'll remember all these terms in phrases and the scenes that are scripted around giving examples in action. The most relevant example of this is the Trolley Problem. First, Chidi teaches everyone about it just by lecturing on what it is. Here, the show is doing the samethrough Chidi, lecturing us on what it is. Next, Michael asks for a more concrete example, and tortures Chidi with the endless simulations. But again, this is the show's pedagogy tooby seeing how Chidi reacts to these different situations, we are forced to see the moral ambiguity beyond the obvious solution (kill one, save five). Then, the show weaves the Trolley Problem into the overall narrative, with Michael sacrificing himself to save the humans. In effect, the show has trained us to see the trolley problem in all kinds of places we wouldn't have known to look for it without this layered pedagogy. Through the different characters, the writers voice different potential perspectives on philosophy, the fairness of this fictional afterlife, and in doing so gives us tools to examine our own lives in critical ways, should we choose to answer its invitation to do so.

Kamilah really is amazing after all, isn't she?

Damn her.

That said, I think his proof about free will was faulty.

He pointed to a number of incidents where Eleanor did things that broke with his manipulation significantly and thwarted his plans as evidence against Eleanor's copout of determinism.  But I don't think it's accurate to say that just because Eleanor's behavior wasn't what Michael expected or intended is proof that it wasn't reactionary.  It could still very easily be argued that the circumstances were causal both directly via Michael's manipulation and indirectly by Eleanor's experiential foundations.

392,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2018-11-14,2018,11,14,0,9wprg3,self.TheGoodPlace,My crazy theory (potential spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9wprg3/my_crazy_theory_potential_spoilers/,Palmquistador,1542121248,"Like most of you, I've been thinking about what the next mind warp will be or even the ultimate end to this incredible show. In the ""The Ballad of Donkey Doug"", Janet creates a simulation for Chidi to practice breaking up with Simone. The foreshadowing of this cannot be ignored.

1. You cannot tell the difference between the simulation Janet created and reality on Earth
2. Chidi not only ""resets"" the simulation multiple times, he does it the same way Michael does, and the same way the Judge does when she resets the timeline on Earth (snapping their fingers)

This got me thinking, as a lot of others have also pointed out, that perhaps this is all a simulation, perhaps even it's just for Michael. Initially I thought maybe this was a hell just for Michael, however, Season 3 has been all about his redemption (and the others too). Not only does Michael do everything in his power to help the gang, he doesn't even have any demonic tendencies left, he is, arguably, just as good if not better than the other four at this point.

Michael says it himself when he is trying to convince Elanor that her mother changed. He has changed. He is arguably no longer a ""demon"".

I did a little research going off of a hunch I got from, of all people, Kamilah. When Chidi attempts to talk to her about Tahani she tells Chidi the meaning of his name: ""God exists"".

Researching all of their names ([https://www.behindthename.com](https://www.behindthename.com/name/jason)):

Chidi - ""God Exists""

Eleanor - Named from a Queen (Royalty)

Tahani - Congratulations

Jason - ""To heal""

Michael - ""Who is like God"", also an archangel

This post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7330nz/character\_name\_meanings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7330nz/character_name_meanings/)) also mentions this along with a couple other meanings I hadn't thought to look for, which further supports my theory.

Now, Tahani, I'm not exactly sure how her name fits in but, there is a lot of going on here. We know the gang is technically ""doomed"" but with Chidi's name meaning ""God exists"", that is really interesting. Perhaps what we have been given as information regarding the Good and Bad place is entirely wrong / misleading / incomplete.

My current theory is that this is an experiment that is actually run by agents of The Good Place in a groundbreaking experiment to see if ""demons"" can be redeemed.

Chidi, Eleanor, Tahani, and Jason are not merely humans. They are ""angels"" helping with an experiment to see if a ""demon"" (Michael) can become a good person. The exact mirror of what Michael did.",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So at the end if the last episode, Michael said that he knew someone who could be their model human being to serve as an inspiration to humans and save their souls. He then says they have to go to rural Canada. I was thinking about this, and thought Canada was an interesting choice since we haven't seen any characters from Canada. Then I realized that we do know of one person from Canada: Doug Forcett.

For those who don't remember, Doug Forcett was the stoner from Calgary who guessed 92% of the afterlife while high in the 1970's. Michael has a portrait of him in his office, and is clearly an admirer. We also had a nice nod to him in the last episode when Eleanor asked Michael about the portrait in one of the memories. 

So my theory is that the Soul Squad is going to try to recruit former stoner Doug Forcett to serve as the model human. If he was a teenager in the 70's, he would be in his 50s or 60s now, so the casting for this could be fun. Someone like Will Ferrell could make a fun cameo as a former stoner who is chosen to save the souls of all of humanity. This series is so carefully planned out that I think the model human has to be someone we have heard of before, and Doug Forcett seems like the best option based on that assumption.

Presumably they would know that these 4 humans that were dead, are suddenly alive back on earth.   They keep track of points as well Im sure.

Ive gotten some mail about this recently, so I thought now would be a good time for a meta thread. Please feel free to comment on any of the topics below. Your responses will help shape sub policy.

___

#The Spoiler Policy

So the spoiler policy here is one of the laxest Ive seen on Reddit. What it boils down to is you cant put spoilers in titles. Barring that, its pretty much anything goes. We would prefer you put [Spoilers] in your title if your content is potentially spoilery and you should use a spoiler tag in comments if the OP implies no spoilers, but these rules are a bit fuzzy, imo.

So my question is, does the status quo work for everyone? Or would you prefer we institute a spoiler policy similar to other TV subs?

##Alternatively

u/AutoModerator could be programmed to boot any thread without one of these spoiler warnings:

* **[Spoilers Unaired]** For rumors, panels, or behind-the-scenes sneak peeks. This would be the broadest warning, potentially spoiling future episodes as well as everything that has already aired. No spoiler tags would be needed in these comment threads.

* **[Spoilers S#E#]** Spoilers up to a specific episode, e.g., **[Spoilers S2E4]** In these threads, people could talk about whatever they want ***up to that episode.*** Anything past that would have to be \&gt;!covered with a spoiler tag!&lt; &gt;!that would look like this.!&lt;

* **[No Spoilers]** The strictest tag. Anything referencing ***any episode*** would have to be covered up.

___

#Shirtposts

There is no official rule against shirtposting. Or at least its not enforced very strictly. The relevancy rule just says content must be related to the show, but there have been many posts on here that are just random pictures with titles quoting an episode.

On the other hand, these posts are often heavily upvoted. So if you all enjoy them, then we can leave it as is. But if you would prefer stricter moderation with more discussion-focused threads, we could step up enforcement in this area, and write a more specific rule prohibiting them.

It doesnt have to be all one or the other, either. We could do a Sunday Funday deal where shirtposts are allowed one day of the week. Maybe Tuesdays since nothing never happens then anyway

___

#Fun Stuff

Okay, enough Serious Business. Do you have any ideas for fun things we could do on the sub?

For example, there was Larry Hemsworth Weekend [after episode five.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9pef5c/episode_discussion_s03_e05_jeremy_bearimy/e819hwl/?st=joexantd&amp;sh=ceb44de2)

(Heres a [reaction thread](https://redd.it/9pvi89) and [heres another](https://redd.it/9psewh) if you missed it. u/Riddla26 had my favorite [Larry meltdown.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9pl221/i_love_how_this_show_takes_race_stereotypes_and/e846d60/?st=joewtffc&amp;sh=a00612ce))

I really enjoyed doing that troll, and Id love to do more if youve got any ideas. : (Maybe ModMail or PM me so it doesnt ruin the surprise.)

If you have graphics or CSS suggestions, this would also be the place to throw them out there.

(I know people want custom upvotes and downvotes, and I am looking into that, but thats not something Ive ever done before so Im still learning how that even works.)

She probably came up with the plan to allow the rest of the group to earn their points, while she knew she would still go to the Bad Place.

But here's the twist. Actually, two, either one is possible.

A) By knowingly doing so, she too earns some points for saving the other three.

B) She doesn't have to. She had already proven to judge she is a good person and she only decided to go with her friends, because the others have failed.

A big plot point that's been developing is that the whole points system to get into the Good Place is fundamentally flawed. So flawed that it makes you wonder if that's how it even really works.

All the information we have about how the afterlife works has been given from the Demons.

Michael apparently based his neighborhood off of a real Good Place one, but where do the demons get the information on how real Good Place neighborhoods work? Maybe that's not at all how real Good Place neighborhoods work, if they even have neighborhoods at all. Even a non-sinister version of that kind of neighborhood still seems pretty flawed, so much so that you have to doubt if that's how the real Good Place actually works.

Janet is (allegedly) a real Good Place Janet. In fact she's the only (ALLEGEDLY!) real respresentative of the real Good Place we've ever met. But she was reprogrammed. And there is other wiggle room for shenanigans in terms of Janet.

And the Judge is apparently an autonomous unit, but who knows what she even really knows or who she really works for.

Basically my point is that the points system, and the one version of a Good Place neighborhood that we've seen (Michael's fake one), seem so flawed that I can't believe either really represent how the real Good Place works.

The Bad Place is either working completely in the dark on its own, or The Good Place is kind of controlling it and manipulating it behind the scenes in the framework of a bigger system.

For all we know, the Bad Place might be so in the dark that it's not even as simple as just a Good Place and Bad Place.

So I have a theory about #TheGoodPlace (an AMAZING show btw): 

By now we know that the points system is flawed, and it's established that the Soul Squad can't go to the Good Place because of their knowledge of the afterlife and how it works, which prevents them from adding points to go to the Good Place. So I've been wondering... does that apply for all humans? I mean, I'm assuming only the Soul Squad and Doug know about the afterlife system, but what if it's not about how it works, but rather, that it just exists? What if that's the issue? 

As children, people are taught religion and morality systems to explain what's considered ""good and bad, right and wrong"". It's an essential social function. But what if from that point forward, every choice was determined by that person's belief in the afterlife or mortality system they were taught? This seems like Determinism, ""the philosophical idea that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes"" (Wikipedia). What better existing cause than being told that there's an afterlife and if you do good/the right thing, you go to the Good Place, or if you do bad/the wrong thing, you go to the Bad Place? It almost seems like a case could be made for atheism in this case because then their choices aren't affected by this pre-existing knowledge. Or is it? 

We live in a world where information is at our fingertips, and most people know about more than one religion. It makes sense that even if you were an atheist, you'd know the basics of how a possible afterlife could work, which would mean you'd still go to the Bad Place because even if you don't believe it, you know about it, and there's the potential that it COULD STILL affect choices, just on the off-chance that maybe there is an afterlife. That means that nearly all of our choices are for nothing because from a young age, essentially we're damned to hell. It's kinda like Original Sin, in that babies, if they died right there, would go to hell because they inherently have sin in them. And if happiness you cause is used as a measure of points, would a baby be born with negative points for causing their mother pain and suffering? That sounds like Original Sin. 

So... here's my big theory: if everything we do is rendered useless from a young age because we can't earn good points because everything we do is subconsciously just to not be tortured in the Bad Place...

...

What if... there are no humans in the Good Place?

Like Zero. Naddy.  None. 

I mean, the system is rigged against us from the moment we are born, and humans are so flawed and the system is so strict, I can't imagine anyone but an angel or a God-like figure existing in the Good Place. The Good Place is the unattainable goal no human can achieve. We suffer and waste our lives trying to ""earn"" our way to a place we were never going to be able to go. And wouldn't the demons in the Bad Place love it? They'd find it hilarious that we even TRIED to get in. 

It's a big cosmic joke that the demons play into because they enjoy the realization that our lives were for nothing, that we're going to be tortured anyways. Realistically, the only way we could get into the Good Place is for the concept of an afterlife to be erased from the history of mankind, and for the system to be made less strict.

Also the Medium Place exists to keep the lie of people being able to go to the Good Place alive. And the demons find it hilarious that EVERY human (except Mindy st. Claire), goes to the Bad Place even though clearly beings like Michael believe people do actually go there. It almost makes me wonder if this whole Good Place conspiracy is known only to the highest authority figure(s) in the Bad Place and the angels/Creator? In the Good Place. Is Judge Gen in on it?

 I might be totally wrong, but that's kind of the direction I'm seeing the show go in. It'll be fun to see if I'm wrong. What do you guys think? 
------------------------
Side note and this may be contradictory to mu theory above but: what if we're building towards a moral/message that the Good isn't an afterlife you spend your lives trying to earn enough points for? Rather, it's here on Earth. Earth is our Good Place.  We have to make our own Good Place by doing things not for moral dessert but just because we can and want to do good. And through those choices for the sake of trying to bring good and happiness to others, we built our own Good Places? We are the Architects. We build our Good Place with the people in our lives, the experiences we have, the good we bring to others. That's the Good Place. Not a ""heaven"" like place?

i get their explanation for tahani, because she had corrupted motivations and was just desperate for attention. but the explanation for chidi sort of contradicts things? they say chidi hurt people with his indecision, but he didn't have bad intentions- it was just that the consequences of his indecision were bad. so are they saying that tahani got into the bad place because her intentions were bad, and chidi got into the bad place because the consequences of his actions were bad? 

also, with mindy st.clair- she said herself she was a pretty shitty person, but her foundation helped to save many people, and the basis of the idea was when she was high, so u could argue her intent was a little cloudy. she got into a medium place. tahani did a lot of stuff for charity and surely helped a lot of people so surely she would have at least gotten a medium place too, even if she was self-obsessed?

There are multiple flaws in the Good Place system as described, but in addition to the overlying issues of ""Is a points system a good/fair idea?"" and ""Where do you draw the line to get in?"" we've seen that the assigned points appear pretty arbitrary.

Assigning point values to individual events seems near-impossible.  And a change in the relative value of certain events is the difference between people making it into the good place, and people not making it in.  Some people would end up in the bad place because donating a kidney to a stranger only got you 590,000 points, instead of 591,000.  So not only does the points system need to be a fair framework in general, all of the point values need to be perfectly assigned.  I don't think that's possible.

As funny as it might be for the Accountant to be a Jason-like character, arbitrarily assigning points, I don't think they'll go that route.  People like the Judge seem to have faith in the system, and I don't think that would happen if everything felt arbitrarily assigned.  

However, I think that they're going to show that any relative points system is going to be flawed, and essentially the same as Jacksonville-Style pool.  Even the best effort to assign points is going to have implicit bias in it.  For example, all of the Florida bias in the points system could come back in a serious way.  And who better to strike a blow against a Florida-biased system than the Jason, Duval County's Greatest Champion?  I think Jason is going to be the one who most effectively questions the Accountant.",25,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

From Earths timeline, she leaves for about 2 seconds and then comes back.  But in the Jeremy Bearimy timeline (I dont know how I can better explain it), who knows how much time could have passed.

Then she comes back through, and it seems suspicious how, after kicking Shawn, she seems to stand silently for the rest of the scene.  Even after the commercial break, she continues to stand in silence through conversations that it seems like she would have weighed in on.  At least once, Michael even turns to her as if to expect her to say something, but she didnt.

At the very end of the episode, more demons start walking in, including Glenn, Bad Janet, and it seems like a bunch of extras (I dont know if I may have missed any others weve seen before).  *Only then* does Janet start speaking.

Then I realized; the last time we saw Glenn was the cliffhanger at the end of the last episode.  He peeks his head through, says We all helped!.  We dont see him come all the way through; he could have just peeked through and come back.  I think that, with most of the main demons from Bad Place HQ on Earth, he may have used the opportunity to do some things behind Glenns back.

We know that Bad Janet cant pretend to be good without melting, so unless they fixed that somehow, its probably not a Bad Janet that came back through.  But I think maybe Glenn stole another Good Place Janet (straight out of the box and initialized), and found a way to control her.  He forced her swinging through the portal in a posture that would knock Shawn down, and then she stood there awaiting instruction.

The next time she speaks is right after Glenn walks in, and shortly thereafter Bad Janet walks in the other door *while texting*.  I think its possible that Bad Janet may be controlling Good Janet with her phone.

Given that the next episode is titled Janet(s), I think there could be a lot of interesting ways for this to pan out if any of my theory holds up.  Thoughts?",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Hear me out - Sean stated that he was pretty confident that everyone would be going to be the bad place, even Doug, but throughout the series, we have seen evidence that a Good Place exists i.e. The Good Janet factory, the angel in Mindys video, the entire premise of the medium place, and we have heard Abraham Lincoln went there.

Eleanor also stated this week that theyre in a multiverse when talking to Tahani and what if shes right but not in the way she thinks? What if theres two Eleanors, two Chidis, two of everyone and one of them are good and one bad, just like Good and Bad Janets? Also, Angel Michael, Angel Vicky, Angel Shaun etc. The reason that the gang cant get to the Good Place is because their good versions are already there and you cant have two in the same afterlife.

The Good Place is Earth, the life we're leading. It's all that matters.

I can't guess all of the bells and whistles that the writers' room will add, but essentially the system is this: You life your life. You die. If you lived a good life, you are reincarnated into another life. (H/T, Jen's comment about screwing up the timeline when Michael wanted to send them back to earth.) If you lived a bad life, you're sent to the Bad Place and tortured until you're somehow given another chance to live.

Plus, if I'm right, the ultimate payoff of the show will be Eleanor saying in the finale: ""THIS is the Good Place...""

I don't know anything about how Michael Schur runs shows, but it seems that he is NOT the kind of guy who thinks he has all of the answers. So him positing that The Good Place is the life we're living makes sense.

Before fleeing to Janet's void, Michael's plan was to head over to accounting to see what might be going on. I have two theories that begin with the same question: what if the problem isn't the point system, but the accountants themselves? 

We know that the accounting department exists in the neutral dimension, so we've probably been assuming that it's staffed by both Good Place and Bad Place employees. What if it isn't? No offense to any accountants reading this, but who would want to crunch numbers for eternity? Bad Place demons, of course - they low-key love torturing themselves (as proven by their affinity for hangovers and ball taps). So maybe The Bad Place volunteered to staff the accounting department and submit the reports on who belongs where. Why wouldn't The Good Place insist on having someone there to verify? Because they're trusting, to a fault - as evidenced by the unguarded Good Janet warehouse. So.....

Theory 1: Fudging The Numbers. Bad Place demons love one thing above all else - torturing humans. It's the reason for their existence. With the accounting department under their control, they've been fudging the numbers and filtering millions of people who belong in The Good Place into The Bad Place. 

Theory 2: A Hostile Takeover. This theory is more far-fetched as it assumes that the accounting department, in addition to tabulating the numbers, handles the physical sorting of humans. We know that Bad Place demons can take the form of humans and pull it off pretty convincingly - everyone in the Fake Good Place seemed like a real, good human until the reveal at the end of season 1. What if, slowly, over the centuries, the Bad Place-controlled accounting department has been sending good people to the Bad Place and sending demons disguised as them to The Good Place, as part of an eventual plan to populate The Good Place with enough demons to carry out a coup and take control of both dimensions? 

The wrench in these theories - why wouldn't Michael know about this? Good question.

It reminded me of a famous maxim attributed to the ancient Rabbi Hillel:

""If I am not for myself, then who will be for me? But when I am for myself, then what am ""I""? And if not now, when?""

 On one hand, when Eleanor is completely selfish, she harms herself and others, and her comment about deserving a tiara and sash for good actions is not a good way to think.  But on the other hand, we see in the episode of how it really is unfair and not right that Eleanor suffers and is taken advantage of despite doing good.

Which is why Michael's line stands out to me and reminded me of Hillel- it isn't about complete selfishness or selflessness, but instead being mindful of how other people's well-being/rights/interest/etc. matter.

And back to Hillel, if Eleanor's problem was that she previously lived only for herself, Doug Forcett's problem is that he lives only for other people, with equally disastrous results.

And I think there's definitely a connection between the two episodes, because (and I'm basing this partly on a comment I read elsewhere), the official podcast referenced Peter Singer when talking about the ""Michael as bartender"" episode, and that is who Doug is reading in the most recent episode.  They do reference in the podcast how being a ""happiness pump"" (forget if they used that term) is somewhat more extreme than Singer's actual philosophy, but it's obviously the way in which Doug takes it.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

She will be nice but also crazy.

I want her to be the opposite of a demon but also somewhat the same.

Her and Nick Offerman need to be in the show as serious but good Good Place people.

Maybe Janet is the only good one, and the Good Place is actually a dictatorship based on a very difficult set of rules. The Angels are fewer but they have a mentality of, For the Greatest Good and are the strongest beings but rarely fight. They believe strongly in the system and the ones who have made it there are actually less happy because the sacrifices they made and what they do - say they work in soup kitchens one day then do door to door sales for charity, etc.

Maybe The Good Place is actually just an endless volunteer work day. Maybe its better than torture but you never got a break and if you start to feel like you want things for yourself then you go to the Bad Place. So basically no one wins because you either live below your level, then spend your eternity helping others until you feel selfish then off to the Bad Place. 


Or maybe its all a lie and there just isnt a Good Place. I can see the Judge just casually smiling and saying Actually there is no Good Place. We thought it was a possibility but humans dont ever qualify. Michael created his own neighbourhood as a milder version of the real Bad Place, but aside from Mindy you really dont have a choice. I rule that the four of you will live in Michaels neighbourhood for eternity.

 Michael would give the four a VIP experience with less torture but they never get a Heaven. Theres a saying in Paradise Lost where Lucifer says, Its better to rule in Hell then serve in heaven.  

Or maybe the four become half demon and they are advocates and guides for humans.  Maybe the Judge says, You four have seen too much and if you agree to work with us I will not punish you. You need to be half demon.  I see Chidi being the best because hes the philosophy guy.

I am hoping that the show takes an absurdist take on life and I think we got foreshadowing of it. The Jacksonville style pool I think is our sign of this.

I think after speaking to the accountants they'll find that they are arbitrarily picking points like Chidi and Jason were during pool. I think the point system is inherently flawed as we can see with Doug's life. Doug Forcett lives to get as many points as he can which seems to wrong since in the past we have seen motivation as such is corrupted and our boy Kant would explain further how wrong that is. On top of his motives being corrupted his life sucks. He has a breakdown the moment he missteps and looses points. The realization of a point system for the after life corrupts us all and ruins our life on Earth. Destroying the point system would make it so everyone just lived life for the sake of life.

I am hoping that Micheal and the crew destroy the accountants system to record points for the crew and essentially become undocumented humans on Earth. They are already dead on Earth as they go to the void and I assume are their souls or whatever they were in the bad place. I am hoping the end will be the crew ending up stuck on Earth and not allowed in the good, bad, or medium place and they decide to make the best of living on Earth. Turning the Earth into the real Good Place. I doubt that they will end up fixing or even changing the point system.

So four main characters died and are in the afterlife. They found out they are in the bad place being tortured by demons. 

They fought and tried to escape, but ended up having their memory wiped and starting over for hundreds of times. 

They finally went back to earth, and right away they were doomed to eternal torture again, because their demon friend blabbed out the secret of afterlife. 

They had mental breakdowns. They tried to help other people, and then had to die, once again, probably to escape demons. 

Does this plot sound like a comedy show? This is the standard plot for a thriller/horror movie! 

How can they take such a dark plot, and turn it into something so fun, moving and deep so effortlessly? 

Since the producer says they plan to have a couple more seasons, I wonder, how many times will our four poor humans be resurrected and die, over and over again? 

I am excited to see more of this show, and I feel happy that I can never guess the next step is going to be. Not being able to predict what is going to happen is a rare and great experience while watching TV shows.

The likely answer is that the demons were cocky or incompetent, but why go to the trouble of building a portal and not bringing atleast 1 Bad Janet and more demons for the first engagement.
Unless its another Shaun blooper like the end of season 2, I think the Demons could have had a more elaborate plan and knew they couldn't beat Good Janet with the first squad. My take on it is Bad Janet was tactically left behind so the soul squad would end up forced to go to Janet's void, thinking they'd out witted the demons again, when in fact they'd be opening the inter dimensional space between the Good Place, the Janet Warehouse, Earth, the Bad Place and Accounting, so the demons would have the potential to have control over all space and apply a similar subtle model to the fake Good Place for maximum torture of everyone in Earth even before death.

Now I see how this goes so Im going to do a little lamp shading right off the bat. I know that what I am saying was probably said before. I know that I am most likely wrong and I may overlook something despite this here are my two cents.
   The series begins seeming like a simple premise a person dies and goes to the good place by mistake and must avoid being caught for fear of the bad place. We all know thats not true and the big reveal for that season was that they were in the bad place all along. 
   The second season follows the group as they try to prove themselves worthy of the good place. The third was about then realizing they were doomed and that they could only help others at first. Then the Doug Forcett episode happened and it changed the entire show.
    Until this point the whole show was a giant philosophical gumbo featuring the allegory of the cave as the signature ingredient. Now ( and possibly since its inception ) the show is about mans inevitable suffering and why you should be bad. You heard it here first the whole show is about why you shouldnt abandon Aristotelianism but why you should active fight against it. 
You see because of Shawn commenting that Doug will be damned to the bad place proved no man will ever get to the good place. Ive seen posts about how the point system in flawed and how the pool scene Alludes to it, but I have another idea. What if the scene wasnt trying to convey the overall arbitrary set up of the rules but rather that there are NO RULES! They dont even exist. There are no rules because there is no good place and there is no good place because BOMBSHELL ... there is no good. No action ever truly leads to good it only appears to but its bad in disguise and no matter how hard you try you will only bring bad into the world. In the scene where Doug gives the young boy his shoe he thinks he is doing good but hes enabling the boys bad behavior which will grow and spread onto others. Everything Doug does is bad in some ways just more subtle. Doug isnt going to the bad place because his motives are flawed, or that hes made his life miserable ( however that makes sense ) , but because he cannot commit good acts. 
  Flashback to when I recapped season 1 when Michael reveal the good place  as a mask for the bad place he was really foreshadowing that good is just bad in a mask. 
   Before I start to beg the question Id like to explain why this means we should actively to bad things. Its because at the very least we should earn our punishment thats it , really there is no other reason its the same reason anyone dows good to earn paradise but since it doesnt exist we should at least put in the amount of bad that the bad place does to us.
  It is my hope that in season 4 the gang makes it to the  good place  to find that it is just as fake as being good itself , asking the viewer a difficult question  Why be good 





Tl;Dr : The Doug Forcett episode proves there is no good at all only bad disguised  as good. And I want season 4 to hold a mirror to the viewer about that premise

Did Doug see the real system or the broken one? No one has ever gotten points because pure motives are impossible. Mindy was too high to have motives, and Gen doesn't fully follow the system.**

\- He has *no* idea motivation matters. His motives aren't mixed, they're entirely selfish, and it doesn't bother him at all.

\- He has no concept of a ripple/butterfly effect. He's concerned only with short-term good, ie making the sociopath kid happy without thinking about all the harm that kid is going to do to others or even his own soul.

\- It's never occurred to him that making someone eternally happy would be worth more points than making them happy on earth? He's never bothered to tell anyone about the afterlife?

\- (Side note, does Doug think it's raw points based or graded on a curve? Because if he's intentionally keeping the truth to himself so he can be in the .1%, he might actually be the worst human being on earth. He would also be intentionally sabotaging the sociopath kid.)

\- He also seems far more concerned with negative points than positive points. He spends so much time on harm reduction he often doesn't get around to doing actual good. He's essentially Chidi. Prime example, he's going to spend three weeks walking to the snail charity donation to: 1) make up the points he lost killing the snail 2) avoid harm to the environment by driving there. But he doesn't even think about all the good he could do in those three weeks.

So what does this mean? Did Doug see the way the accounting system is supposed to work, or the screwed up version they've been using? And is he still not good enough on the screwed up version?

My theory is, the system doesn't take mixed motives into account. An action only counts for points if the motive is 100% pure, which is literally impossible. Even for the soul squad. They do truly care about their loved ones' souls, and they're not expecting an eternal reward, but they do want temporal fulfillment and to get their minds off their impending doom.

How my theory explains

\- Mindy: She was so high that she was mentally incapable of thinking about what she would get out of starting the charity. One could even say her motives were neutral  she may or may not have cared about helping people, but she didn't have *bad* motives. The next morning when she withdrew the money, she probably had enough mental capacity back to have corrupted motives. However, her sister would have found the plans even if Mindy hadn't taken the money out. So maybe the dispute over whether Mindy should get the points, was really a dispute over which actions should be counted as leading to the charity. On this theory, the only way to earn points would be a complete lack of awareness about consequences to oneself in the moment of a good action. So only someone like Mindy or Jason would be able to earn points.

\- The tests, especially Eleanor passing: Gen could just be capricious and/or not aware the system is broken. She seems to be allowed to make fairly subjective judgment calls on a person's overall character, kind of like she has a veto power on good place/bad place decisions that might not exactly line up with accounting's decisions. Or she has the objective power to determine whether a person is fundamentally good or bad, but she's just never bothered to find out if accounting is making the right decisions. She said herself she learns as little as possible to stay neutral.",24,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sorry for formatting also on mobile! 

Seeing how Doug Forcett knows of the good place and how to get in there by accumulating points. The problem is his intentions are un pure, which was a big point made at the beginning of the season that since the intention to get into the good place is tainted.

I think when Micheal wants to use Doug as the representative of a good person he realized Doug isnt a good person. 

If they fully rework the point system I think they will use Eleanor and the whole gang as examples of people who deserve to get into the good place since they helped people even when they knew they would never make it in. The difference between the gang and Doug is that Doug doesnt know hes doomed to the bad place so his intentions arent pure.

I guess to circle back I just think Eleanor and them will be used as an example of people who deserve to be in the good place using a new point system which brings back the whole idea of the manifest that Micheal and Janet right which is being presented to some being, and we are watching that manifest unfold (I read that theory on here and I really liked it) 

I still think The gang will end up forked over some way, but because of them there will be a new point system using a new model of how to judge people.

Doug Forcett happened across a drug induced hallucination which happened to show him the Good Place / Bad Place. He changed his life to only do good for everything around him and sacrifice his own happiness. His own actions of making everyone happy was still a selfish act as he was doing it only for the points. His points do not matter because of this and he will end up in The Bad Place. 

The Bad Place only wants the 4 because as they learned they were not going to The Good Place, which in turn made their acts of Good, since there was no way to get to the Good Place, not selfish. Every person they help actually raises their score. Because All Humans are selfish in their Good acts these 4 would be the First people to go to the Good Place ever. The ""Rulers"" of The Bad Place cannot have any humans in The Good Place because it would mean that humans can truly be good, which they do not believe to be true.

(Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9y3soa/big_theory_does_the_good_place_exist_spoilers/,samblanes,1542521481,"I keep falling back on this theory every so often and I feel like I have enough evidence to support it. So here goes:

There IS no Good Place.

Here me out. The word Utopia, as coined by Sir Thomas More, is a weird combination word. Part of it is 'Topos' meaning place, but there isn't really a greek translation for the ""U-"" portion of the word. **However** there are two words that fit neatly in its place. ""Eu,"" meaning Good (ergo ""The Good Place"") and ""Ou,"" meaning ""No Such"" (ergo there is no place with which to begin). Thomas More's book about the peacefully perfect country is meant to be an ironic title: there is no physical way to create a perfect 'good place.' 

I mean, the show consistently relies on famous literature since it is based on Philosophy professors and their books. Michael is symbolically and literally a guardian angel (see ""The Bible""), so he is guiding the four humans through the afterlife. There is a precedence for using books to convey undertones and themes.

Enough literature, lets get back to the show. The title of our favorite sitcom seemed to make sense at first: Eleanor is a bad person in *The Good Place*. In season 2, it was all about trying to get to *The Good Place*. However, in season 3, the group has discovered the afterlife on earth and now can not ever go to *The Good Place*. So why the title? 
The Good Place doesn't exist, so the biggest fore-shadowy revelation was right in our face the whole time.

The show has a reoccurring trope of turning the synopsis on its head, and based on some new revelations, this seems to be a big one that is plausible. 

Exhibit A: There IS a flaw with the points system. This has been a reoccurring theme throughout the season, but why would this statement even be a revelation? If the 'Places' have been in operation since the beginning of the universe, this must have come up sometime.

Exhibit B: Sean's Statements. Sean throughout the most recent episode (3x08) has brought some things to light, mainly 
* Doug Forcett is (presumably) going to the Bad Place
* Michael doesn't know something big that Sean almost said before Michael pushed him through the door.

Why would these revelations be touched upon but never explained, if the characters were visibly intrigued or confused about them?
If the Good Place doesn't exist, Doug would default go to the Bad Place. 
Michael pushing off the revelation is the show poking our heads until later in the season/show when the big reveal happens.

Michael also is a relatively newer architect than Sean (who has a somewhat higher status), so it makes sense for him to find out and/or already know about the falseness of the Good Place. I mean, heck, he already made an illegal door to Earth, so maybe it is a higher-up secret to maintain balance.

Exhibit C: Michael's Lies
Based on (3x07), we now know that Michael fabricated much of the fake 'the Good Place' we saw in season 1. Therefore we should take everything with a grain of salt, including:
*The Soulmates
*Good Place Reps
I bring the latter up as a strong counterargument of this theory in the past was that Mindy St. Claire saw ""The Good Place Rep"" on her TV in the medium place. However, this can now be labeled a fabrication, just as Michael posed as a Good Place Architect in Season 1.

The only hole I can find in the theory is the presence of Janet. However, it is potential that 'Janets' could be a completely separate entity than the 'places' as we do not know much about how that all works. Luckily for us, the next episode (3x09, Janet(s)) should delve into this topic for us.

My hypothesis is that this season, ending with ""Pandemonium,""(the capital of Hell in Paradise Lost) will finally reveal that there is no Good Place, or at the very least, there isn't a functioning Good Place anymore.

TL;DR: The Good Place doesn't exist because of the show's usage of literature to convey symbolic themes, and season 3 is showing us how much we don't know about how their afterlife works.

Season 3 on the other hand goes through so many ideas and plotlines so fast that these moments that are supposed to be big (like, for example, them leaving Earth last episode instead of going to Doug Forcett's house), don't have the weight that the first twist did because they didn't take the time set up a foundation to subvert.

Jason likes things and likes that Janet's does not what he is says and gives him whatever he wants. In fact season 1, Jason was scared, confused, and a lonely at first. He ordered a Janet to give him things and it did, allowing him to have his bud hole. He'll told it to what he wanted to eat and it provided him food. He said what's games and clothes he wanted and Janet did what he said. Jason wanted sex and Janet's tried. Jason wanted a wife and Janet followed its programming and did whatever he said that it could do. The humans in season two were formed an alliance with Michael and Janet again followed its programming and did whatever their humans wanted. Janet was a computer following programming.

That Jason wanted a computer is cleared sign that he was just thinking about himself and history needs. He was not interested in all relationship that worked for both of ways. With the tahani, Jason but zeros effort into learning about art or learning about what to tahani liked so they could talk. He had no interest in even in helping her with her party planning or meeting her halfway. He never invited her to play Madden with her him. He showed up zero interest with having a real relationship with any of human at all first.

As Jason improved, he became better. With tahani he at l spent a few seconds listening about and game she liked and he he her with one of party. He taught her a game.

On earth, where janet had no powers, Jason has zeros interest in it. Jason liked stuff and liked in the afterlife liked it giving him whatever he wanted, but that is really it. On earth, Jason loved how Janet's knew the prices of paintings, but his interest in  it was nothing more than interest in Google or a book with a list of prices

A relationship should not just be liking what someone or something can do for you. Jason used to dig up flowers and give them a to Tahani, but he never did that for Janet. Jason never showed any indication that he like anything about Janet's beyond its body and it is doing thing he said first him. On the other hand, Jason took care of drunk tahani by seeing her back to here hotel as a gentleman.

Now, I do not actually thinks that Jason and Tahani is ideal either. I think Mindy St Claire or Eleanor's roommate would be better matches for Jason, better still Chidi's ex. I would like to seek Jason with judge Jen for a while. Ultimately, however, I think he should end up with Arianna Grande. If not her, someone who, liked Jason, is big with music and dancing, who likes the jaguars and will play Madden with him. Whomever he is ends up, however, should not be Janet.

Janet is not really built for human dating. Anyone human it is with, is someone it would be programmed to serve in the same way as other humans it would lack true free will because of its programming and thus could not truly love that person. Janet and Jason at first was greet because it shined light on how selfish some relationships were can be. It is not true love if you just like getting free stuff from someone and want a not exactly a magical slave robot lady incapable of free will programmed to serve you.

Janet and Derek are still possible if Derek can be fixed. Janet and another Janet could be interesting. Especially, a bad Janet and her. Still, Janet can not have sex she was not designed for sexual relationships.

Many people are single. Some choose to be. Others don't find the right person. Maybe it would be nice for a TV show to stand up for these people some and give an example of it being possible to be happy and ok single. Maybe have Janet's find a way to be truly happy and fulfilled single.

I do not know, but I one thing that I really hope is that The Good Place will not match Jason and Janet. I am really worried that such a match would make it seam ok to have a relationship that is based on a person liking free stuff and are servant programmed as pretty much a magical slave.   Jason was willing to kill Janet in season 1 just for the fun of pushing and button. When Janet thumb flies off, tahani expressway concern for it but not  Jason. When Jason and tahani are getting married and Janet is sad, it is again tahani who asks of it is ok. Jason never did anything to comfort Janet on that situation, but he did to comfort tahani. He apologized to her and talked about how much he liked her and he had a much more mature relationship with tahani than Janet.

At the the end of season 2, when Janet told Jason it was loved him, it was great example of how it is not love. Janet talked about herself. It did not say that it thought Jason was pretty, smart, caring, and considerate. It  did not say it wanted to build a life with him. It was basically only thought of about itself and how it was felt. It had been emotional feelings for Jason and that was it. Then Jason sad he loved her and Janet corrected me home saying it was not a girl. Imagine if a gay guy walked upto a straits guy who is drunk in a variety and says he wants to hookup and the guy says sure lady. The obvious miscommunication might cause some problems if they have vertically different expectations and then mechanics of hooking up. Janet does not have female reproductive organs and that is is a huge problem for Jason. Janet can not even kiss. Even in that situation, Jason continues to do the same thing as usual and refuse to accept Janet's as it is. In season one and two Jason continually calls it as girl, days Michael is its dad, and basically makes it clear that he is does not think it is worth the effort to listen to it or get to know it. This relationship is a great example of exactly how a relationship should not be. Jason treats Janet horribly. He does not listen to it, he only has rarely interacts with any con for its own feel. He mostly just orders its around and has it gives things to him. He has never given it anything. No one flowers, no poems, nothing. Then, he ignores most of what it says or asks. Janet says not to tell Michael, and Jason almost immediately does. Janet days Michael is not its own dad, but Jason ignored it and called him him that.

I get that Janet is not a human woman, but I am worried about what it would say having them together.

I think Janet and Jason can easily be seen as a plantation owner and slave. Janet seen as not human, and existing purely for the pleasure and to serves humans.

They one thing that the Janet's end Jason relationship is not  healthy. Janet should find someone who loves her for who and what it is. Someone who listens to it and respects it and cares for it or it should say single. Jason should find a wom who lives love's him without being programmed to love all humans. Someone with a things on common who helps respects and cares for for. Someone who has biological capabilities like kissing and meeting his physical needs. Someone with a soul who respects  him.

Janet didn't even hesitate when told her by the Eleanor to give Jason something distracting to excluded him from important conversations. She never stool upset for him and said that she was thinks that he was isn't smart enough andrea makes important intellectual contributions and should be respected and listened to. She is does not object whenever he is sent to away from so there group can deal with important things with out him. She is does not respect him.

Janet and Jason are a model of what a relationship should nothing be. They can't have sex or kiss. Jason does not accept her body as not female. Janet does not value Jason's, admittedly not great, intelligence. Jason refuses to do what Janet's asks, like keeping quiet about their relationship. While Jason did not keep quiet for tahini and gotten tahani flowers, he did not do that for Janet. . Jason liked it Janet purely for it doing what he said and its looks. Janet married Jason because he was there it did not go against her programming. On earth without its powers Jason's showed  zero interest in it. Janet, meanwhile conspired to the blocked a relationship between him and tahani that's might be have made them happy. It made a break from porn staring at him without his consent or approval. Imagine if a guys snuck into your house and posted spy cameras to rape you naked and made all vr out of it. I mean it used magic powers, but the point is the same that it violates his privacy.

Anyway, I realize that reasonable people can disagree, but I think Jason and tahani are not right for each other. They are just like those people who end up divorced because they are not really in love. Janet is having her f crush and that is cute, but it needs to do what most people do and move on. Jason is just the first person to express interest in it and that is really why it has a crush. Jason does not live her for who she is. He is never accepted its inability to have sex in the first reboot and an eternity of trying will not change its ability for that. Janet's does not help Jason to grow nor for him to be more giving. Jason deserves a real woman who respects him. ",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Since she's on earth she wouldn't be saying fork or bullshirt like in the afterlife - she should be outright swearing a lot.  Especially at the start of the season before the time jump right? 




Why are all the demons humanoid, even in private moments where they are all together scheming, when it is established that they don't like wearing the human outfits/disguises and they'd have no reason to stay looking that way. In fact it would be way more terrifying if they had turned up to that fight last episode looking demonic. If people argue that most just are humanoid then why bother sending those who are not to 'the good place' anyway? Just send the great supply of human looking ones for that neighborhood and keep the scary demons in hell torturing people. It does make you wonder why more wouldn't be scary looking to fit their purpose if that is the case too. 





Why did no one mention during the entire of last episode that it's impossible for Doug to get into the good place? This is because he's only doing good things in return for reward in the afterlife which has been established to make good deeds null and void. It doesn't matter if it's just a theory to him and that he doesn't actually know for real about the afterlife system - he's still doing good things for a selfish reason. Yeah the system is broken and that's the point but it still means Doug has no chance. Neither Michael or Janet seem to consider this.
Also why do they need to study what makes Doug tick? Janet should already know because she has all information from before she lost her powers. 
The trip was superfluous if Janet would just speak up but she doesn't. 


Note I love the show but just thought it'd be worth exploring some issues with it.

This is a theory about the Good Place.

&amp;#x200B;

First - I think it will likely still exist. We know that just over 30 years ago, they were still participating in the points system when Mindy St. Claire went to the Middle Place.  


I think instead of it being a ghost town, not existing, being infiltrated by demons...  


... that The Good Place might be filled with unhappy humans and Angels who just can't get it right.   


Mike Schur wants the show to explore ethic principals and pose questions. Considering that, regardless of their point totals, these are still imperfect humans who have been told they should be in paradise.. that's a lot to live up to, right? After you have everything and anything you want for however long... don't you think they'd get bored with that? The fact is, humans love one another AND drive eachother crazy.  


We've seen that in the face of struggle and peril, people can change for the better. But in the Good Place.. you're in LITERAL heaven. There's nothing after this. Is there a reason for you to keep being good? Also consider that because someone did something VERY good when they were alive doesn't mean they aren't uncomplicated and incredibly human.  


If the Good Place straight up didn't exist or if it was a ghost town, we would be exploring plot instead. Which isn't really the point of the show. I think having heaven overrun by human imperfection and chaos would be a great way for the show to continue to explore moral and ethical principals and continue character development.",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Based on where we're at right now, here is what I hope for in the final ending:

* Janet, who is now fully sentient, is the most powerful of all Janets. And at some point she understands the flaws in the system and how to solve them. In that moment, she uses her Janet powers to instantaneously reorder the universe. Because I think it would be awesome if the afterlife AI went skynet on them.
* by the end of the series, we have never seen the good place.
* The new world order is presented in a way that acts like a call to action for the audience to implement the main message of the series (that it's worth it to think about how to do good, and to do good), without picking a specific philosophical interpretation or providing an afterlife- based motivation (since either would make huge swaths of people reject the message outright). So I think this means that the main characters, and us, aren't told what the new system is, but are told that the in the new system there is not really a good and bad place anymore. So Michael or Janet  has to say something like ""don't worry about the afterlife; just worry about this life"".

At the end of the most recent episode, Shaun said that he knows that everybody the Brainy Bunch tried to save, even Doug Forcett, will be going to the Bad Place. This foreshadows a plot arc that I've been predicting since I first started watching the show, so I figure I should probably come out and write about it now.

My prediction is that, in the next episode, Shaun will reveal why he knows that all the people they've met will go to the Bad Place: in reality, *everybody* goes to the Bad Place. To sniff out any Bad Place architect that might turn soft on the humans they're supposed to torture, they tell Architects that they have a counterpart that doesn't torture humans, to catch Architects that may have a change of heart and try to defect to it (like The Brotherhood in 1984).

There is no Good Place.

Now, that's just my prediction for the next episode. If I'm not mistaken, Mike Schur has a couple more seasons planned out, and I know that this show burns through plot developments a lot faster than you'd expect, so I can't guess what the timeline on this next part would be. It'd be another twist that immediately recasts everything we thought we knew an a completely different light, so I'm imagining it'd be at the end of the next season, but, like I said, this show goes *fast*, so it could come later in the same episode.

Anyway, my prediction for the *next* twist that would come after *that* is exactly what Eleanor said, about all this actually being a test for Michael (like how Jason predicted they were on a prank show half a season before it was revealed to be actually the Bad Place). This hasn't just been a test for Michael, but for all the humans from W-12358.

The fake Good Place that was described to Michael was a world where people were judged at the end of their life for their actions on Earth, and assigned to one place or another for the rest of eternity based on those actions (which they had only been loosely told was happening). However, that would be an absurd way to run the Afterlife, as Michael has been discovering.

The *real* neighborhoods of the Good Place aren't about taking people as they were on Earth, and rewarding them in perpetuity for that brief period of time. When they first started doing Good Place neighborhoods, that *is* how it worked: Architects would make perfect neighborhoods for everybody, catered to all their exact wishes, and environmentally structured to never make them feel uneasy or bad about anything.

However (like Agent Smith described the first iteration of The Matrix), this kind of paradise ended up having a fatal flaw: even the most beatific people to come to the Good Place, after living long enough in this environment that never upset them or challenged their character, would become spoiled and cruel. (Why wouldn't they? There's no reason to be good any more: everybody's going to be satisfied anyway.) Despite all the seemingly-infinite power that control the Good Place, they still couldn't do anything to stop a ""perfect"" neighborhood with even *two* humans in it from turning into an all-out war zone within a thousand years.

In light of this, the Good Place convened a summit, and decided to rework their approach: instead of taking the *best* people and rewarding them for eternity with everything they ever, they would take *medium* people, just like Eleanor has been saying she was from

But Good Place architects started from a place of loving humans too much: like Janet being unable to not produce a glass of water when asked, they couldn't bear to make humans the least bit unhappy. So, the Good Place devised a new way to on-board new architects: The Bad Place.

The purpose of The Bad Place was to give eternal beings a starting position that *delighted* in making humans miserable, with only a glimpse of another way they could do things (in the form of the simplistic Good Place Shaun had been telling Michael about). If the Architects *start* from a place of wanting to make humans miserable, like Shaun would go on to say when telling Michael there is no Good Place, they start to turn soft, and to want to see the humans *change* in response to the ""tortures"" they throw at them.

The neighborhood Michael designed was, in fact, a *perfect* Good Place, in the real Purgatory-style vein Good Place neighborhoods are actually designed under, and by independently realizing this without being told it was what he was supposed to do, by caring enough about what's right to defect from the Bad Place and directly confront Shaun, Michael has passed the hazing ritual and is ready to assume his place as an actual Good Place architect.

Now, the question here is: how do they decide who goes to this Good Place? Well, from the very worst of humanity, to the very best, *everybody* has room to improve, room to be challenged, and to grow from these challenges. Everybody's a ""medium"" person, relative to the better person they can always become.

As Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani have discovered, all it takes is meeting the right people to steer you onto a better path. The algorithm Michael was told matches humans who die at roughly the same time is actually designed to find the people who will make each other better. Everyone gets placed based on that. This is where everybody goes.

There is no Bad Place.

Everything is fine.

Now, of course, this theory has a few loose ends: I'm gonna post the first one that comes to mind, and my best idea of how to explain it, but I'm interested to hear people's other thoughts in the replies.

## What about Mindy St. Claire?

Mindy is actually the worst person in the history of the Earth: she made her plan to start a massive charity as an impulse on a *cocaine bender*, and given all of Eternity to develop as a person, she's still just going around gardening naked, masturbating, and Jonesing for cocaine. It's possible that Mindy's been put into a few different neighborhoods, and they've never been able to change her (and she'd had a detrimental effect on every human they tried to match her up with), so, to just triage the problem, they invented the ""Medium Place"" single-residency neighborhood for her to just stay isolated while they tried to figure out what to do next. (It's possible that revisiting Mindy's case and designing a neighborhood that *could* change her could be a plot after Michael is accepted into the Good Place.)",10,1,False,self,,,,,

During my first viewing, I just assumed that these flashbacks were meant to establish characterization and provide moments of comic relief. These scenes do these things, but they *also* tell the viewer why the main 4 characters end up in the bad place before the reveal ever happens.

Eleanor is shown being a flaky, selfish person. Chidi's crippling indecision and need to be the 'nice guy' end up causing a lot of harm and frustration for everyone in his life. Tahani's flashbacks are all about her trying to one-up her sister and prove herself to her parents. Jason's flashbacks are just him being Florida trash. At no point in any of these flashbacks do these characters, even Chidi and Tahani, seem like people who could have met the impossibly high standards required to get into the good place.

I don't think he just forgot to. This is Michael we are talking about here.

He pretty much gave Gen access to Earth again by sending Shawn through the Blue Door with a spare key. I think Michael wanted her to be able to round up any stray demons so his friends would be safe at Doug's, and maybe make her pay attention to Doug's - very very sad - case. It's not the humans' fault that Michael and the other demons got involved in their new lifes, so to keep things fair Gen would have to save them from any demonic meddling. Psychologically, that's a brilliant move: If you help someone, you get attached to that person, AND while Gen was distracted doing that, Michael and Janet could have gone to the Accountants.

Like people have mentioned on this sub many times... we havent seen high or tail of the good place. I think its real, but I think everyone is sent to the bad place first.

I think everyone is given their opportunity to earn their way into the good place in the afterlife (when they have no idea theyre being tested, after it seems like theres no hope but to go to hell.) but if they meet the news of hell with non-humility and anger, then they are doomed to spend eternity that way.

A person is defined by the things that they do, and as we try to be better people, we see the results and usually try to multiply this results until they become part of our nature. Like, when Eleanor did her best to give back that guy's wallet she was rewarded with knowing of that she helped someone who really needed it. That good feeling is what a lot of people get when they do things they believe are good.

So, from this I can draw two conclusions. First, that we can start out with a corrupt intent and eventually we can find out the reason why we try to be good. It's like when we train children to play with others or to do chores for a reward. They will get used to it and eventually do it out of duty or habit, or just trying to avoid a heavy conscience.

Second, there is no such thing as a pure intent. Every time someone does something good, they do it out of a sense of duty or a reward. The reward might just be peace of mind or the feeling that you know you did something good. But still, you don't do good things just for selflessness, I don't think. Or you might do it out of a habit. But if so, doesn't that mean this good action is done simply because it was your nature to do so? Of it is your nature, can it be considered good? I mean, it doesn't require much effort, since you don't think too much about it. It's automatic. 

Now, Doug is different from Tahani in my opinion, because he actually cares. He might be a tool but does good the best he can, while Tahani only did it out of jealousy.

This was something I thought about before I listened to it due to the fact that she basically told the judge to drop it and fail her. Did she actually pass? If she did that means she would have gone to the good place but after that whole discussion where the judge says she believes they did it for a reward. What could Eleanor possibly have to gain by declining to go to the good place? She showed that she is her best self and that she cared about her friends. The tests were also sort of unfair, for example Jason had to ask to not play the game which was pretty unfair because it didnt actually prove anything. Jason did what she asked of him and ended up failing. The only fair test I can see is Chidi spending to long of a time picking out a hat. Tahani also showed that she grew by proving she didnt care what her parents thought of her. Tahani, Eleanor, And Jason are products of their upbringing. Eleanor never had a shot to begin with, her parents made her selfish due to their selfish attitudes, Tahani was pitted against her sister her whole life and was taught that self image is the only reason to be good, and Jason poor guy had a dad that loved to scam people (also I hope we learn about his mother because that would be interesting) 

I believe that Michael realized the points system was flawed due to their upbringings. Not one of them had a chance because all their lives they were taught to be selfish. The system doesnt account for bad parenting and Michael wants to prove that people like them need to be guided because of that bad parenting.

In an idea called the luciferian expirament, which is based around gnosticism there was the all. A chaotic entity that existed in a dimension where everything that ever was and ever could be was held at a single point and that point was the entity known as the all. The all is the creator of all creation. The all created many beings that existed in the same dimension that it existed in - one of which being is Lucifer. Lucifer was the greatest of all of the all's creations. The all intentionally created Lucifer to try to become like the all. With the Alls blessing Lucifer created a separate reality that was broken off of the oneness with the all. This reality was based around free will where as the all's reality everything existed with no free will and only the ability to percieve and be one with the all. Lucifer created this reality based around polarity. Supposedly there have been other realities created before Lucifers attempt, all unsuccessful. Michael the archangel created a reality in which was founded upon justice and it failed miserably. The philosophy later continues to say that we were one of the angels that went with Lucifer into a lower dimension, with the blessing of the all. Lucifer in our reality is God and satan rolled into one character, the true power over our reality.

Jason. 

* Raised by a dumb criminal in a city full of dumb criminals. (No offense to Jacksonville, I know nothing about the actual city and go by the Jacksonville of the show)
* Possibly has a disability. Either way is too dumb to know better.
* Poor with no education. No other options.

Conclusion: Jason couldn't have been a better person with what he was given. 

Eleanor

* Never loved or been loved. Mistreated and neglected by parents. Doesn't know how to care about other people.
* Raised herself from age 14 and arguably before that. Had to be tough to survive.
* Tried to be good when for 6 months and it sucked. Learns that there are no rewards for being good.
* However has self-awareness. Is able to improve in the Good Place. Learns to love. 

Conclusion: Eleanor didn't have a chance in the real world. However she is self-aware enough to improve under better conditions.

Tahani:

* Parents favor her sister instilling insecurities from a young age. Don't seem to love her.
* Sister treats her terribly and constantly publicly humiliates her continuing her parents treatment.
* The stress and expectations of a public life can make anyone lose touch with themselves.

However 

* Is very rich and could live comfortably without her family in her life. 
* Has travelled all over and met all sorts of amazing people. Could have learnt a lot from them if she wanted to and built a family of her own with better people.

Conclusion: Her parents didn't treat her well but Tahani had a million opportunities that Jason and Eleanor did not, and could have chosen to be a better person.

Chidi (keep in mind this is the character who's background we know the least about currently): 

* Possibly suffers from a mental illness. Has had problems with decisions since a young age.

However

* We can assume Chidi has an academic background. Is shown to be very academic already as a child. Thinking so much should to lead to self-awareness yet he has none and always blames almond milk. 
* Has his life together. Works with something he's interested in, has close friends (guy getting married, boots guy), has had serious relationships (in flashbacks there's a woman he seems fairly serious with). No bad circumstances excusing bad behavior.
* Is constantly called out for his lack of decision-making by people he cares about but still doesn't realize he has a problem.

Conclusion: we don't know why Chidi is so indecisive and that will probably change in the next few episodes, but so far he has no bad parents or other bad circumstances explaining his behavior.

mild cold. Id get Netflix, but only the kids section. Id get an unlimited number of art supplies, but theyd all be Cra-Z-Art brand. Id be able to listen to any song, but theyd all be plagued with an unskipable, four minute long rap section.Id probably be able to eat any food, but it can only be food I havent tried before I died. (Im a really picky eater, and I hate trying new foods.) 

As for my house, I imagine it would be the size of a standard apartment, but I would have a ton of pointless things that would take up half that space. Every day, Id lose something valuable, only for it to show up years later when I have no use for it. Since I hate the heat, thered always be a space heater running. Id have access to YouTube, but Id only be allowed to watch stuff on the front page (which almost always sucks). 
 
In the Bad Place, Id constantly be at a party packed with people. This party only serves my least favorite foods, and the guests force feed me until I throw up. If I refuse to eat, Id get rained on my hot sparks. After the party is over, a random cousin of mine would be sleeping over at my house. Id constantly be forced to entertain them, and everytime I think about resting, my eyes will be blasted with shampoo. After my cousin leaves, I take a shower with either boiling hot water, or absurdly freezing cold water. (Its randomized so I get surprised each time).
 Then, Im forced to attend a party, before the eternal cycle starts again.

The ideal Good Place Neighborhood for me would essentially be one big theme park. Everyday, there would be new rollercoasters and attractions, and Id be able to experience them all without getting a single bit tired. At night, Id spend my time drawing or browsing the internet, which I consider to be some of lifes final pleasures. Id also be able to travel anytime Id like to, probably through simulations with Janet. The neighborhood would also always be in the midst of the Christmas Season, with the streets playing Holiday Music, and the shops being decorated with lights.

Every 100 years, Id probably want to be rebooted. Id imagine even Heaven would get stale after an eternity, so Id want to be able to forget it, and relive it over and over for eternity.

I took it on face value at the time and never really thought about it til a couple of days ago, when I thought about how much the plot has changed and how Michael was never actually the weigher of souls (being a demon all along). So I read up (hello Wikipedia) about Archangel Michael and holy shirt you guys, I think A) Mike Schur is very clever and B) Archangel Michael's story is our story. 

Basically in every religion, Archangel Michael is the middle guy between God and everyday people. The demons always try to stop him and he always defeats them in the end. The details differ from story to story; sometimes there's fire, sometimes there's serpents. But he always defeats them. Michael always wins.

This is what Islam says about him: Michael is often depicted as the archangel of mercy. Therefore, he is said to be friendly, asking God for mercy for humans and is said to be one of the first who bowed down before Adam. Furthermore, he is responsible for the rewards doled out to good persons in this life.

Read it for yourself, it's interesting either way. But given how much thought we know goes into this series, I think going off this, Michael will change the system for his friends and all of humanity for sure.

Im going to put the **tl;dr** up front: There is no good place, the points system is intentionally flawed, and while Mindy St. Claire is a real exception to the rules, its because shes the first and only true Saint.  
From the opening of the pilot, weve had enough information to identify severe problems with the points system. Some could be written off as comedic license  harsh penalties for being from Florida, or liking a certain sports team, for example  but the fundamental nature of the points system is at best a terrifyingly obtuse implementation of deontological ethics. Its a form of deontology that is impossible to derive a priori, and thus entirely useless as an ethical structure. Its an arbitrary and unknowable system that could reward or punish literally any type of behavior.
But it gets worse. We eventually learn more about the points system, in particular through Chidi and Tahanis reasons for being sent to the Bad Place: intentions alone are not enough, and *actions* alone are not enough. Chidi, who spent his life trying to be the best person he could be, failed to get points because he had trouble deciding *how* to be good. Tahani, has the opposite problem: her motivations were not as pure as Chidis, even if she accomplished the good deeds that he could not. Requiring both good deeds and good motives isnt necessarily a terrible way of measuring things, but it leads to a major failing in the points system: being born with material advantages gives you a huge leg up on the afterlife, simply by being more capable of performing good acts. Note that material advantages can mean intelligence, good health, charisma, or other personal traits that are outside of our ability to choose in addition to wealth or privilege  a smart person who is born to a wealthy family with access to excellent education has a better chance of curing cancer for big points than a mentally challenged person born into slavery in a developing country. Keep in mind: the points system does not allow any room for context. Eleanor brings that up in season 1; having shitty parents made it *harder* for her to be good.  
&gt;!I am thrilled that the show is finally exploring the inherent problems with the system, and that Michael et al are beginning to fight against an unjust system. Doug Forcett is a great example of how the points system can fail if it *is* known, and it should be clear why Shawn believe Doug will end up in the Bad Place: just like Tahani, his motivation is selfish. None of his points will count if hes only behaving well in order to get into the Good Place. Our primary foursome is struggling with the same hard truth there  by knowing the truth about the points system, they are doomed to failure. Damned if you do, damned if you dont. Literally.!&lt;
These problems are *obvious* ones. Its shocking to me that Chidi, who spent his life studying ethics out of a desire to *be good*, did not spend more of his time in the Good Place learning about the points system. You know, the absolute fundamental truth about ethics in the universe? A completely unambiguous system which, once he died, was no longer hidden behind the irremovable goggles of mortal life? The best explanation for his disinterest in the points system that I can come up with is that on some deep, subconscious level, he has rejected it. The points system may be a fundamental truth of the universe, but it is not a *moral* system. (Personally, I believe that any system that allows for infinite punishment for finite sins is an immoral one, but thats beside the point.) Even Michael, a demon who delights in the results of the points system, recognizes its failures.
So if the system is so obviously failing that the audience can spot its problems in the pilot, some dead humans can recognize them and form valid complaints about it, and a demon can rebel against it, why has nobody noticed those problems before and tried to fix them? Easy: its *supposed* to be a broken system. Humans arent meant to make it to the Good Place. We are born to suffer. And for hundreds of thousands of years, we have. Michael isnt actually the first demon to come up with the idea of inventing a fake Good Place, hes just the first one to bother physically creating one. The Good Place has always been a myth, a fact hidden even from the Bad Place demons.
Think about it. Weve only ever seen Bad Place demons (with one exception) and neutral entities. And while there are clearly such things as Good Janets, weve never seen an *activated* one except for the one Michael stole (but weve seen at least two Bad Place Janets). The only evidence we have of the existence of a Good Place is a recording of part of the trial of Mindy St Claire, in which a Good Place entity argues on her behalf. But just because there may be a theoretical infrastructure for a Good Place, that doesnt mean that anyone has ever gotten in.
I posit that the true battle for Mindy St Claire was never about whether or not she deserved the points for her plans. She got the points. Points are automatic. The problem was that the system never expected for any human to ever actually earn enough to get into the Good Place. The bar was purposefully set too high. Mindy just managed to pull off a miracle and clear it. (Side note: drugs allowed Doug Forcett to guess the afterlife at 92% correctly, which even demons couldnt believe, and drugs allowed Mindy St Claire to draft up revolutionary plans for doing good on Earth. Not sure if thats meaningful.) She was the first person to technically deserve the Good Place, but since no such place exists, the powers that be were forced to create a new space just for her. St. Claire is a true Saint.",26,1,False,self,,,,,
820,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2018-11-27,2018,11,27,3,a0lxm7,self.TheGoodPlace,Is he still hiding something?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a0lxm7/is_he_still_hiding_something/,locojoco,1543256560,"""he"" being Michael, but you probably figured that out from the title.  

I think that Michael is still hiding something.  

When he kicked Shawn into the portal before he could speak in ""Don't Let the Good Life Pass You By"", he acted as if he did that because he didn't want to hear it. But what if instead, he didn't want the humans to hear it?  
  
  
More thoughts: during ""Worst Possible Use of Free Will"", he very much did not want Eleanor to see how that reboot of her afterlife turned out. He explained that he didn't want her to see Michael torturing them, but it isn't as if him being a demon is some revelation, he told them pretty much the day that he met this incarnation of them. You could say that hearing about it and actually seeing it are different stories, but once he finally gave the the memories, he was just acting like a bit of a dick. Nothing extreme.  

So, I think that him giving her that memory was a classic case of covering up a major misdeed with a minor misdeed, in order to make it appear more believable.  
  
  
Even more thoughts: he turned over to the side of Team Cockroach *very* quickly. I originally thought that started caring about them over the 300 years of reboots, but on a recent rewatch, I realized that this is not the case. Even after all of the reboots, he still referred to the humans as creatures that scuttle on the ground in their own filth. He joined their side not because he cared about them, but because Vicki threatened to rat him out to Shawn. And then somehow, he became a virtuous being who cares deeply about all four humans over the course of two or three episodes. (If you disagree my use of the word ""virtuous"" remember that he even felt guilty about framing Vicki). This seems way to fast for someone to radically change their worldview, especially when this someone has existed since forever.

IT seems like it is a common fan theory noew- but I haven't agreed with this, and as a somewhat obsessive fan of the show I thought I'd put together some reasons why I don't think that's supported by the show:

-In Mindy St. Claire's Orientation video, we meet Beadie a representative of the good place: http://thegoodplace.wikia.com/wiki/Beadie 

Beadie explains that they tried to get her, but couldn't, and they had to reach a compromise, and that the Good Place provided all of the good things about the Medium place- subject to Bad place modifications

While Mindy did thing a good thing- start a charity- she isn't the only human to ever do that, so it stands to reason other humans who have done similarly good things would also get into The Good Place.

-Janet, of course, is affiliated with The Good Place. In the episode of Michael and Janet, where the neighborhood is created, she believes she is creating a Good Place Neighborhood.

-Val references The Good Place when she meets Janet- ""Where did you get this? Did you actually into The Good Place somehow?""

-When Michael shows the gang a map of the Neutral Zone, it includes an arrow showing the exit (presumably via portal) to The Good Place: http://thegoodplace.wikia.com/wiki/Neutral_Zone

-When team cockroach arrives at the Judge's HQ, they are given a test to see if they have improved enough to merit getting into TGP. It all involved if they had overcome their character flaws- if it didn't exist, or if it was such an incredible thing that nobody had ever gotten in- it's hard to see how those tests could have merited getting into TGP.

-From this season, &gt;!When the Judge catches Michael and cancels the experiment, she says the four are now regular humans and they are on their own for getting enough points for the TGP. This implies that it exists and that it is possible they could get in. !&lt;

-Michael and Janet do seem to be aware of who is in The Bad Place- Janet mentions Columbus is there, Michael says that Victor Hugo is there(and this after he has joined Team Cockroach). If everyone, or almost everyone from all of history was there- they would know it- and if nobody had even gotten into the Good Place, why would they be so hopeful later on they could help the Humans get enough point to get into The Good Place? Michael and Judge Gen did the experiment because Michael thought the Humans under the right circumstances had a real shot of getting in.

-When Glenn questions Shawn on why they care so much about these four humans, he says they already have 60 billion people to torture. Estimates on the number of people to have ever lived is 100 billion. 

You could question any one point, but taking everything together- I think there is enough in the series already that shows evidence for The Good Place. Plus- from a storytelling perspective- where would the story go if there wasn't one? Or if nobody in human history had even gotten in, how could they ever justify it for these four?

Now, I'm sure there will be more twists, and I am sure part of it is going to be something has gone horribly wrong with the point system or The Good Place- but I am pretty sure that it isn't going to be that TGP doesn't exist or nobody has ever gotten in. They have good writers on this show, and whatever surprises they have in store will be one we aren't going to see coming. ",13,1,False,self,,,,,

My only question is what would this show be categorized as? My other favorite shows House and Community both fall under Postmodernism where they reference themselves and other entertainment to find meaning, understanding, and identity. So a lot of paradoying other shows, introspection, and references. This is my understanding from a limited education but vast consumption of the arts. So shows like the Office, Parks and Rec don't fall into this category to my understanding. Can't really say because to be honest I can't stand those shows. I've tried many times but just can't take Amy Poehler's character nor Steve Carroll. I feel like I have to endure them to enjoy the rest of the show which I usually do enjoy. 

Anyway I find that The Good Place fails into this unknown category. It doesn't rely on references to tell jokes even though it does use them on occasion it is not part of the plot. Examples would be Michael acting as a bartender referencing Sam Malone. It doesn't even matter to the plot that he is behind the bar just kinda funny he is. Where as Community has episodes or almost every episode dedicated to a certain movie or show. The other main difference is that unlike Dexter, Community, or House the goal isn't trying to find the true identity of one's self but instead The Good Place is trying to find meaning for us as a people and who we can become. Where House or Community finds meaning for the individual characters and tries to accept them as who they are with minimal to no growth shown, The Good Place seems to take the flip. Look at the characters as individuals some, but primarily look at their growth amd development as individuals and a group.

I guess the short version is past post-modern shows look for the true self and the characters true core as if they don't know who they really are. The Good Place assumes who people are and focuses on who they want to become instead or who they want to become with a group. Such as The Good Crew wanting to be good people with humanity. I guess this could be called the humanistic movement in television.

Hopefully someone smarter than I can decode my ramblings. Really I just want to know how we would describe this show artistically, because I think it is a new thing though I am probably wrong.",30,1,False,self,,,,,

Mindy St. Clair is not that great a person, but did one really good thing and apparently made enough points to get in. There are plenty of people who live better, more selfless, more helpful lives that make a bigger impact that Mindy St. Clair did.  Heck, Eleanor choosing not to abandon her friends was enough for Gen to send her to the Good Place. I dont think Mike Schur is cynical enough to just say nobody makes it in. Getting into the real Good Place is difficult and rare, but I fully believe that many have made it. 

That said, I dont think the real Good Place neighborhoods are anything like we expect they would be. Imagine waking up after your death to find out you were an objectively good person, and now youre in literal heaven with a Janet to fulfill your every desire and with functionally no consequences for the decisions you make. Youre not striving to make the world better, because its already perfect. Youre not hoping to improve your soul for an afterlife, because youre already there. You won the game, and no one can take that away from you for the rest of eternity. What do you do?

I would suspect that, given enough time, you would turn to a life of total hedonism, nihilism, debauchery, and selfishness. Nothing matters any more, we dont need each other to survive, theres no punishment waiting for you, so why not just go absolutely wild? Theres no reason to be good anymore when you dont need anyone, no one needs you, and you absolutely know that theres no bad consequence from your actions. 

Remember, Architects tend to leave behind the neighborhoods they design fairly quickly, and theres no reason to suspect they would ever return to check in on their guests. I suspect that well visit a real Good Place neighborhood sometime soon and discover that its descended into an ethical hellscape. 

This is ultimately just one more reason that the system as designed is fundamentally flawed. The basic concept of an infinite afterlife is problematic, because it warps and distorts the finite time we have here on Earth. The promise of infinite punishment or infinite reward means Doug Forcett is absolutely right, and the only rational action is to sacrifice everything here to hope for a reward later. The afterlife itself needs to be either scrapped entirely, or transformed into a soul refinery dedicated to continuing to help people grow ethically and spiritually after death.

This world exists in a place where hell exists and the criteria for not going there are implied to be extremely hard to meet, as well as super arbitrary. When you have a baby, you are condemning them to a probably &gt;50% chance that they will be tortured for literally eternity (unless you're French or from Florida, then it goes up to 100%).

Since the next episode has a longer wait, I started to think about what happens next.

My question is how will they get out? What is the void? Because being stuck in an empty void forever is pretty boring for a TV show.

Here's what we know so far: 

1. There are multiple Good and Bad Janets.
2. Janet is not a girl, robot, or human, she is a BEING.
3. Janet has things in her void (you can hear all the stuff she has when she was ""drunk"" looking for Derek in her void)
4. Janet has powers only in the not-Earth Place, but her powers come back with contact with the doorway.
5. Janet can make a mini-Janet (I'm calling Derek a mini-Janet because he also has a few powers.)
6. Our Janet is a very advanced Janet.
7. The next episode (s3e9) is titled Janet(s)
8. Michael (ex-demon), the humans, and Janet are all in Janet's void.
9. The humans are officially dead on Earth.

Could it be possible that Janet's void is the Good Place? Could all Good Janets share the same void? Could this be at least 95% accurate?",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

After all, their favourite meals were usually based around what they ate when helping others. 

This leads me to two ideas about the real Good Place:

1. They just die. It's a choice between being tortured for eternity, or getting to stop existing.

2. They are reincarnated back on Earth, to help more people (although given that that's a specifically religious idea and no one other than Doug got more than about 5% right)

**Chidi and English:** the post so common even the official [twitter](https://twitter.com/nbcthegoodplace/status/1046060028744978432?lang=en) pokes fun at it

This has been around since the season 2 finale. The premise is way back in the pilot Chidi says what is said in the good place is translated so everyone can understand each other, but in season 2 he speaks English. Season 3 episode 1 clears this up: He speaks 5 languages including Latin just in case

For discussions here is a sample: [8 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/84nhzk/two_questions_about_chidi/), [11 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9y94p7/why_isnt_chidi_speaking_french/), and [5 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/8twbn0/why_chidi_speaks_english_in_s02e12/)

**Chidi does not belong in the bad place**

This has been around for a while and the argument goes: indecision should not be enough to sentence someone to eternal damnation with a side comment about mental illness. Although no definitive answer, it's probably the almond milk. My thoughts are more he didn't do enough good as never acted or indecision is ok, not thinking about the impact on others is not ok

For past discussions a sample: [develop selves](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9ramqj/what_chidi_being_in_the_bad_place_might_mean/), [went to destroy point system](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/8r3cp4/theory_spoilers_why_chidi_is_in_the_bad_place/), and [feel weird about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9ovsm1/does_anyone_else_feel_a_bit_weird_about_the_fact/)

**Good place doesn't exist**

Once again, been around for a long time as all information we have could be lies, and there isn't a lot of evidence it does exist (except good Janet, what people say, and girl in Mindy's video). Some say there is enough and the twist would feel cheap.

Samples: [doesn't exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9y3soa/big_theory_does_the_good_place_exist_spoilers/), [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a0r91q/evidence_for_the_existence_of_the_good_place/), [doesn't exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7tdjew/there_is_no_good_place/), and [exists but no one gets in](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9p3tau/theory_regardless_of_whether_the_good_place/) (my personal preferred idea)

**Michael is an archangel**

Rather than our little demon, Michael is actually the archangel Michael either in bad place incognito, Shawn kidnapped him, or he fell from grace. Doesn't come up as much but is part due to name similarities, reports Schur changed name after seeing angel Michael in an art piece, Michael's torture method not being so torturous, and Michael being a pretty swell demon with an amazing Australian accent and talented with disguises

Samples: [Archangel Michael](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9z87h7/convincedmichael_is_the_archangel_michael/), [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a079v0/archangel_michael_a_theory/), and [smaller thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/87cyn0/my_michael_theory_possible_spoilers/)

Alt: Michael is [god](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9zutr1/what_if_michael_is_actually_god/)

**Michael is the one being tortured:** the big brother theory of they are still in a simulation and the torture never stopped

The theory goes Michael is actually human and is being tortured as his bad place with the soul squad demons in some theories. This basically comes from Michael's plans all failing and never really having a good time. He gets his neighbourhood but humans ruin it, he gets reboots but Vicky is demanding, he gets Janet who brings him cacti and loves a human, he gets threatened with retirement, and now he's off with humans being redeemed (Michael still lying to them I'm leaving off this list as less frequent).

Samples: [pre-season 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/778slk/maybe_michaels_the_one_being_tortured_in_the_bad/), [theorising](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7wdh4u/the_michael_theory/), and [what if?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7tk636/what_if/)

**Why Doug is (not) going to the good place**

Once again, after the last episode I swear there was one of these posted every 2 hours for a day and have since dropped down to just every few days. The premise of the idea is Doug is living a minimum harm life so does not belong in the bad place. People have argued nope, he's getting butt spiders because he minimises harm not maximises good, has corrupt morals, pee water, and some of the dogs have collars. Others argue as he doesn't know he's right the morals aren't corrupt

Samples: [bad place](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a0qfrd/shouldnt_doug_forcett_go_to_the_bad_place/), [good person?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9zvgxa/discussion_is_doug_forcett_actually_a_good_person/), and [going to the good place](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9z6p6x/spoiler_doug_forcett_is_going_to_the_good_place/)

Similar but way less frequent post: [How did they not know](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9xrl9z/really_dont_get_how_michael_and_especially_janet/) how Doug lived?

**Season 3 isn't so great**

This is another post that is starting to die down but was regularly posted a while back. Season 3 was very different to the previous seasons, it was slower, less Janet powers, less overarching plot or sense of urgency or end goal, we get it. Personal taste and preferences. Don't need that many posts about it saying similar things.

Samples: [friends lost interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9u1yic/help_most_of_my_friends_have_lost_interest_after/), [disappointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9wlgej/five_episodes_into_season_3_and_so_far_its_been/), and [we're in the bad place](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9w4fzc/season_3_feels_like_we_are_living_on_the_bad_place/) 

**Honourable mentions:**

Bad Australians accents thank god they are gone

Simone is from the good place, judge, or a corrupting demon

When is the next episode? Where can I find it? Season 3 Netflix?

Not a post, but Shawn being spelt 3 different ways sometimes within the same post. It makes me smile.

&amp;#x200B;

None of this is trying to say 'don't discuss this' or this sub is shirt or mods delete and ban all reposts. I love this sub. You guys have great ideas. Occasional reposting with new ideas can be interesting as we get new info. Just...we don't need another Chidi speaks French post (triggered this) and some of these can get repetitive when no new information is added or posts nearly identical. Especially with posts about release dates as 2 seconds on this sub or google would give the answer. Maybe just dial it back a notch or have a bot that says ""-13.44 points for repost""

Mods, feel free to delete this

Accountants, feel free to minus 4036.231 points from me. I've already accepted I'm going to the bad place

I mean, yes, they are wearing human suits to mimic human appearance, but shouldnt they be a lot heartier underneath it all?  Theres no way they should be evenly matched against actual humans.  In fact, they seem to be even frailer than real humans.  Tahani is able to completely knock out Chris Baker after a moderate whack of the pool cue.  It doesnt even seem like that would be enough to knock out a real human.  (For someone who has been going to the gym, a lot, he sure is bested rather easily!)

Compare that to Gunnar in episode 1.02, who had a dumpster fall from the sky on top of him and he didnt miss a beat.  Clearly being on earth affects their constitution.

But I also got to thinking: what is even the point of fighting an immortal being?  Obviously escape is the first priority, but given their apparent frailty on earth, I wonder if their bodies could somehow die (or some process akin to death) while they are here?  What would that even mean and how would that work?

And I know Janet is pretty badass at fighting, but why isnt she even better?  Even without her powers, she has all the knowledge in the universe.  Knowing everything about every type of martial arts that ever existed should allow her to dominate the room pretty quickly",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,
