So, there's this moment where the accountant shows Michael and Janet that caveman, who gave a rock to the other and earned 10000 points. We can presume that's no longer the amount of points someone gets from giving a rock to other people (and consequentially, being altruist), because, if so, the Good Place would be crouded.
Here's what I'm imagining: the points system not only takes in consideration the morals of an action; it also thinks about how often that action is done, because that would make a difference between what is just your culture and what is something you've done because you're a good person. 
Following this line, it is just like humanity got rid of new good things to do 500 years ago; or, at least, of a big enough amount of new good things to send you to the Good Place.

The person watching for the first time said that he heard about the big twist, and had technically been ""spoiled,"" but he had dismissed the idea as we watched the first season because ""it \[the show\] was so good"". 

That made me incredibly grateful to the show's writers. A lot of media that includes twists relies on the twist invalidating everything that came before. (You've been chasing after the wrong bad guy this whole time! The sacrifices you made were in vain!) I don't think the twist would work half as well if it was a ""gotcha!"" moment to play a trick on the viewers. Instead, it was a new way for our heroes to explore their capability to change.

I have to say that I am bothered about the character of Janet. Don't get me wrong, I love her as character, but something feels off about her. In fact, the relation she has with the other characters frustrate me.

She is said to have access to all the knowledge of the Universe, not only mankind knowledge from books and Internet on Earth, but of the whole Universe. This is somehow confirmed by the fact she knows which lottery tickets can pay off \*sigh\* and by the fact she is denied to talk about the Bad Place during Season 1 - so she also knows about the after-life realms.

The few times the characters used Janet's knowledge were for very low-level reasons. Jason apart, who can't do much, they never properly harnessed her powers.

Janet also stated that all questions that were asked to her were deemed to stay private. So not only can she deliver crucial information, but she will also stay quiet to other people about doing so, even to her owners.

Examples of situations which frustrate me with Janet:

* When the characters know they are in the bad place, they do not ask anything to Janet about how to properly escape;
* When Eleanor wants to figure out if Michael will be deceptive on his promise to help them get out of the bad place, she does not ask Janet if there is a way to formally contract with a demon-architect in a way that would enforce the agreement;
* Chidi who is a knowledge-seeker never have long talking sessions with Janet to understand the Universe - is he a damn fool?
* Michael has less knowledge than Janet, but never asks much to her despite being her main companion during season 3. For example, Michael says he is immortal, but somehow we know that he moved from a job position to another (being an accomplished architect) which implies that he was created at some point in the past... Still, he never wonders where he comes from, or if he knows, never says.
* Michael has to go to accounting to collect some answers - why not ask Janet?

Don't get me wrong. I understand that using Janet to deliver shallow answers about the origin of the Universe, God or solving difficult situations would be quickly boring. But at least I feel we are deemed to have the characters TRY to do something about it, even if the explanation ends up with a ""Jeremy Bearimy"" answer.

Come on... I can't believe the characters feel so stupid when they have access to the ultimate knowledge library, right here, right now.

Your thoughts?",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Like, even if they all get sent to the bad place and Janet is marbleized and Michael is retired, I wouldn't be mad. The Episode is as follows:

\- The gang meets God and presents their case (this would be way in the future, probably toward the end of the show). God can be anybody, but if it was Amy Poehler it would make it a meta-Mike-Schur-self-referencing-masterpiece. 

God decides that the system needs to be changed. Their solution? A good old fashioned, Parks&amp;Rec-esque public forum. You know, where Leslie would gather random citizens to ask their opinions and they would yell terrible ideas at her?

All I want is for some Bad Place demons, some Good Place angels, the six main characters, the Judge, the accountants, Mindy St. Claire, everybody, in a room (comically it could be like a middle school auditorium, even in the afterlife), and all of these people are arguing with God at the front of the room, and the good and bad places have to argue out a new system. Think of all the amazing possibilities. 

Thematically it would fit into the shows plot and actually makes sense for everybody to together decide a fair system. 

Comically, I mean, have you SEEN Parks and Rec's public forums? It could be so forking amazing.

Just by virtue of his outlook on life, the influence he had through teaching and studying ethics, and even that he cares enough to struggle with actual ethical minutiae of everyday living, his point total should have got him in despite the impact on his friends and family.

Same for Tahani, the direct good impact her charity work had on the world should have basically brute forced the system. She could have ripped ash on a nun and still not been anywhere near going to The Bad Place. 

However, since we now know the points system is broken and everyone has been getting screwed, they didn't. But if the system is fixed, I think those 2 would go up, the other 2 would go down.

(On mobile so apologies for bad formatting)
Apologies also if this has already been discussed to death and I just missed it....

So, I was sorta half rewatching S2 in the background and wasn't really paying attention to it and wandering about cleaning up when out of the corner of my eye I saw that Mindy had grown angel's wings....I turned get a better look and realized that I'd been wrong. Of course, she hadn't really grown wings (that I'd failed to notice before--it was just the impression given when she was standing in front of her shell sculpture (the shell swoops up and became Mindy's wings). 

Could this be hinting at something? It seems unlikely to just be an accident. Not only was Mindy positioned that way at all, but she stayed in that position for quite awhile. MS has stated in interviews that every single detail in every image we see has been poured over and meticulously worked on. I dont think she'd be given angels wings for an entire talk by accident. 

I don't see how  it would make sense, but I'm almost long-shot convinced that Mindy is an angel now.

A summary of the article by the Philosophy Bro [here](https://www.philosophybro.com/archive/susan-wolfs-moral-saints-a-summary)

Some relevant passages :

&gt; I don't know whether there are any moral saints. But if there are, I am glad that neither I nor those about whom I care most are among them. **By moral saint I mean a person whose every action is as morally good as possible, a person, that is, who is as
morally worthy as can be**. Though I shall in a moment acknowledge the variety of types of person that might be thought to satisfy this description, it seems to me that none of these types serve as unequivocally compelling personal ideals. In other words, **I believe that moral perfection, in the sense of moral saintliness, does not constitute a model of personal well-being toward which it would be particularly rational or good or desirable for a human being to strive**.

.

&gt; [...] if the moral saint is devoting all his time to feeding the hungry or healing the sick or raising money for Oxfam, then necessarily he is not reading Victorian novels, playing the oboe, or improving his backhand. **Although no one of the interests or tastes in the category containing these latter activities could be claimed to be a necessary element in a life well lived, a life in which none of these possible aspects of character are developed may seem to be a life strangely barren**.

I was watching season 1 again, and this whole plot twist thing seems really unfair, you see, there are genuine moments where stuff that happens doesn't really sync with the blad place premisse, lot's of pointless stuff happens. Kicking the fake dog into the sun tortured no one, for example.

To be short, I will limit to the complaint of the sinkhole episode, if Michael is realy in character, then why do we get to see him freaking out together with Jannet? also, can Michael force Tahanni to glitch out? How could he prevent that Eleanor would fist the cake off to start the sinkhole plot to start with?

I have read that it was planned from the very start, but watching season 1, really doesn't fells like it, it seems as if the whole of season 1 happens in a good place with bizarre things happening with no clue whatsoever about the big twist, as if the twist was planned last second.

Because that might keep a great deal of people out of the Good Place, but I can't seem to understand how that would be everybody, especially Doug Forcett. He's lived an incredible life and he's also incredibly self-sufficient, meaning he does pretty much everything on his own, and he's earned over 500,000 points. I mean, maybe the cut-off was always 1 million or something crazy like that, but doesn't it seem likely that he is the one person that would definitely have enough points to get there?

Possible caveat: maybe he originally bought everything from some shitty supermarket chain that underpaid its workers and gave its CEO way too much money, which is very likely. But still, he does have a LOT of points. Hopefully this gets answered at some point.

However, it is important to not that it is not The Good Place show itself, nor the main characters in it, that have this mindset, but rather the points system that punishes humans based on the unintended consequences of their actions. The very same points system that has been shown to be critically flawed.

Furthermore, the show has depicted the four main characters as worthy inhabitants of the Good Place, yet their points scores contradict that claim.

So, to claim that the show is pushing an anti-capitalist agenda is an inherently short sighted claim. It is merely the points system-the main point of contention within Season 3-that has this rigid set of ethics that supports an anti-capitalist agenda.

Rather, a more balanced analysis is necessary-while important to be mindful of ones ecological impact and the butterfly effect of their actions, to obsess over them to the point where you refuse to buy your Grandma flowers is pointless. After all, Doug Forcett, despite his best efforts, is still bound for the Bad Place.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Not the show itself, but the flawed points system that is anti-capitalist.",24,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

We saw how after around 1500 more or less nobody could get into the good place. Why? Cause globalization started there, with the colonization of america.
From there almost every commodity was the product of slavery or destroying a civilization.
You were a simple farmer who grew potatoes and tomatoes? Bam, potatoes came to you via killing and enslaving of mayans and such.

And from then on all sort of action was tainted by the bad of someone else.
We know lincoln ended slavery but even him couldnt reach the quota cause everything in his life was the product of something bad, from his clothes probably made by slaves, to the whole running an imperialist country who decimated indians and such.

So how can mindy be good enough to have a medium place? 2 things
1- good globalization. Sure, everithing you do gets you bad point cause of too many bad ramifications. But its also the reverse, a single good idea for worldwide charity in modern times can affect so many lives that the total of good points you can get is huge. 
2- chance. Mindy got a lot of bad points by her lifestyle but her single great idea got her even. Chance helped her cause she died right afterwards, so she could be even instead of scoring negative which would certanly happen if she lived more.

Its amazing even to think that maybe mindy could get in the good place if she lived a good life by normal standard, her score wouldnt be enough but she got even with a very bad grade, so maybe....",21,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry but the true Good Place is a living Hell. You HAVE to do everything right... that's eternal damnation, Kellen had to resign simple because he misspoke. A minor error in speaking and he LOST HIS POSITION, that is torturous. Even if it's just the ""Angels"" it's still hell as it will translate back to the humans there somehow, for example they can't help you if problems arise, and we know they can with the current problem of a crap system sending billions and billion of humans to eternal torture that they will start to solve in FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS!

&amp;#x200B;

But more over clearly the Good Place allowed a system that absolute ignores your intentions and only looks at the result. If Tahani was back on earth she would have been losing hundreds of points for trying to cheer up Jason and Janet, as for the Good Place it doesn't matter if your intentions were good, she just kept making them feel worse so that would have all been negative points back on earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put sweat shops are just negative effects on other people, bad chemicals on plants again are just negative effects on the environment and other people, so that's all the system boils down to...

Buy your friend dinner they get sick... that's negative points

You buy a pool, someone drowns.. you're a killer, a lot negative points

You tell a random woman ""Wow you are very beautiful"" but she has body dysmorphia and it triggers her to kill a bunch of models, well you just help do a whole bunch of murders buddy... you're going to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine a place where you had to check how and where every screw and nut of every piece of furniture you buy, you have to check every microchip and circuit from your cellphone, TV, any electronic device, research every part and component or every car or machine you use. And if there are any negative effects from them it translates to you getting negative points... would you want to live like that? in fact who would ever want to live like that or find it acceptable... that's a nightmare. But that's the system the ""Good Place"" found acceptable and has allowed to thrive least you be sent to hell with no concern on their end.

Chidi took charge and made decisions for the sake of the person he loves. Janet and Jason took the time and space to figure out feelings that are somewhat new to them. Tahani went over the top in acting without self-interest, trying to show her acceptance of Janet and Jason's history.

Eleanor helps Michael introduce the first new human to the Neighbourhood; Chidi discovers a complication.

Presumably, the next step is trying to figure out how to fix the system.

Michael still has the Book of Dougs with him and Eleanor's father, Doug Shellstrop, and Jason's father, Donkey Doug, are both named ""Doug"", which will very likely become relevant in the future.

So, my theory is that while developing the new system, they will use the two fathers to test it, to see if it works as intended. We will see vignettes from their lives and then the cast will discuss how to judge the actions that we have seen.

One problem with this theory is that you want to test the new system on someone who should get into the Good Place (like Doug Forcett), not the two fathers, who presumably belong in the Bad Place. Maybe the solution to that is they will be assigned to the Medium Place? I'm not sure about this part.

I mean sure you could say that only the intent of an action will be judged but is that really fair? If that were the case actions such as stealing, murder and even genocide could be justified if the person committing the action truly believed what they were doing was right. People like Jason would be allowed into the Good Place because they are completely blinded by their ignorance to actually realize what they are doing is wrong. 

Ok what if the action itself is only judged with no care given to the unintended consequences or intents of the person. If that is the case then people like Tahani would automatically go to the good place for their contributions to humanity even if they were only performing said actions of fame and attention and not because they actually cared. 

Fine, what if people are judged according to if they lived their life performing the best actions out of the choices given to them. For example when given a choice between choosing a company that works their employees to death and a company that not only works their employees to death but also destroys the environment they pick the first company due to it being the lesser evil. Well then people like Chidi who spent his life isolating himself from friends and family due to the fact he always tried to make the best choice would make it to The Good Place. 

How can you fix this system to actually make it fair but effective? Is this system to flawed to actually ever fix? What is the endgame for The Good Place?

Abraham Lincoln is a tricky topic in the good place (the show).

Facts

Nobody got in tgp in 521 years.

Michael doesnt know who gets to the good place (the previous fact is a revelation for him).

Michael Does know the details about the bad place.

Lincoln got a lot of points for ending slavery.

The problem: in S1 Michael says that every us president is in the bad place Except lincoln. But we know that the last person to go to tgp is much older than lincoln times. The answer is easy. Michael was lying to Eleanor and saying that lincoln is a good guy plays into hers (and ours) expectations. BUT Michael should know if Lincoln is in the bad place or not. Cause he is a famous person so, if you know who is in the bad place (as michael should) you can desume who is in tgp by exclusion. By seeing lincoln in the bad place michael knows he is there.

So why lie to Eleanor about Lincoln? Why tell ""x is in the good place"" if you know for sure that its not true?

If it would have been shaun we know why

Of course maybe its a jeremy bereamy situation and the 521 years are after lincoln",15,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

After all, the world hasn't existed under a universal capitalist order for the past 500 odd years. Capitalism, by definition, wasn't a thing before the Industrial Revolution and even after that, it was not universal to the whole world. And even when it comes to expanding Globalisation, which judging by the timing was the major contributing factor for no one getting accepted into the Good Place at all, there still are, for example, Amazonian tribes with barely to no contact with the outside world, and yet none of them is getting into the Good Place either. Why is that?

I'd argue that with what we know about the point system now, even previous to the 16th century, basically from the time humanity came out of its caves and started forming civilisations, the Good Place was something maybe... 5% of humanity in the entire human history could qualify for? At best.

What we learned about the point system is that it runs on strict *Consequentialism*. Meaning, it's prime focus are the consequences of your actions. And that to such an extreme degree that it accounts for ALL the bad consequences of every action, no matter how unintended or minuscule. As well as accounting for unintentionally upholding or benefiting from unjust and unethical systems or unwittingly enabling horrible people to commit terrible deeds, by extension making you accountable for other people's action even if you're not aware of them. That would mean that, for example, 105 BC the free citizen of Rome Lucius Dougus would have been as unable to buy flowers ethically as our modern day Doug. Or do anything ethically, really. Because the economy of his entire society was operating on slave labour and military conquest that he was benefiting from daily, from birth to death. Hell, he would probably own quite a few household slaves himself and not even consider them human. Not to mention other systematic injustices like strict patriarchy and class hierarchy among free citizens. 

The same would apply to every person ever living in societies run on actual or de facto slave labour and upholding other strict hierarchic orders, which would be... sadly, a vast majority of societies throughout human history. And those are just the broadest of strokes. We know that you can get negative points for much more innocent things than buying flowers from slave owners or benefiting from human misery in other ways.

Yes, as we discovered, at some point globalisation had made the butterfly effect of human actions so big that it became completely impossible to die with enough points for the Good Place. But the way the system works, people would've been hard-pressed to get into the Good Place even way before that. Our world has gotten smaller, but I'd argue that humanity on average has certainly not gotten more unethical.

Back to capitalism and the critic of it: As a show written by a modern American writers' room primarily for a modern American audience, the Good Place always picks examples closest and most relevant to its creators and its audience to illustrate the philosophical systems of thought that it explores. In this case, Michael illustrated both the inherent ethical problems with capitalism, but also how Consequentialism when taken to the absolute extreme means that there is literally no way for a person to be good. And that extends beyond capitalism and onto the entire human existence. 

TL;DR: The point system is broken because there's no ethical consumption under human existence.

I'm really glad they tied in the aspect of intention and purpose. Anyways, it just went to show me how Chidi is truly the center of this show. Chidi is said to have not gotten in because his indecision created pain in his and other people's lives. Chidi also would over analyze his choices (ie, the almond milk debate, ""the ethical ramifications of different soups.""), and he is one of the ONLY characters to do so. I found it very interesting how TGP committee was going to take 400+ years to deliberate and would not reach a decision. This is a clear parallel to Chidi and as it's been discussed in this thread before, is a huge commentary on our social situation. 

The show is crafted together so well, and I can't wait to see where the rest of this season goes. I think this irony was a result of some tight writing, as the writers of this show tend to juxtapose situations like this before. I truly think Chidi will be some sort of a key to TGP committee and where the system goes from here. ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I commented this on another post, but I think there may be four levels to this system, roughly correlated to the alignments of role-playing games: 
Lawful Neutral = The Good Place (People here are so concerned about following the rules and appearing good, rather than truly being good).
Chaotic Neutral = The Medium Place (Mindy is as chaotic as it gets: snorting cocaine one moment, establishing charities the next. Plus, no Janet here, which also plays into chaos as opposed to law.)
Neutral Evil = The Bad Place (ran by evil demons that follow some rules but not others)
Neutral Good = The Best Place (?)

I also think it's tiered system, maybe roughly correlated to [Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development). Worst to best, there is The Bad Place, The Medium Place, The Good Place, and The Best Place. 

The Bad Place takes souls with points below a threshold, which we'll call zero.

The Medium Place takes souls with score of exactly zero. 

The Good Place takes those with low positive scores.*

The Best Place takes those with high positive scores. 

*The catch here, of course, is that the Bad Place has been taking all of the souls that belong to the Good Place. I think the Good Place is fundamentally flawed due to its strict rule-following and also, in my theory, that it is not The Best Place. I believe the Best Place would be good enough not to have a flaw that would allow the Bad Place to steal from them. 
I think a few of the characters we follow belong in the Good Place (but not the *Best Place*) and due to the Good Place's flaw became destined for the Bad Place. Doug Forcett, for instance, belongs in the Good Place but not the Best Place because he is too focused on his own rewards and consequences. The Best Place is for those who do the right thing for the right reasons.

This individual is Jewish and I am as well, and he noted how the reveal not only means that all Holocaust victims are being tortured in Hell, but so are most victims of persecution and oppression throughout history (all since the the 1500's), because the system doesn't ultimately differentiate between being the perpetrator of the worse forms of globalization and being an average person/a victim.  So like yes, Columbus is damned and presumably say King Leopold, but so were all their victims.

And what this person found particularly troubling about the implicit reveal that Holocaust victims are being tortured alongside Nazis, is that the show currently seems to be advancing what is essentially a traditional Christian cosmology, even though it started from the premise that all religions are wrong.

By virtue of the reveal about ""no ethical consumption under capitalism"", the show is essentially taking the view that everyone is damned and deserves to be.  And presumably is going to have Team Cockroach ultimately save them (i.e. through Grace alone), including conducting a sort of ""Harrowing of Hell"". So yeah, they've accidentally invented Christianity.

I don't really have any good answer to this analysis and I do find it quite troubling, despite still loving the show. In part because of my own religious perspective, I've kind of been hoping all along for a reveal that in some measure the Real Good Place has done something to fix things to the greatest extent possible, including arranging it so that only the worst people (if anyone) have been sent to the Bad Place and that everyone else is basically in stasis until they can work out a better system.  

Which would be sort of in line with at least some Jewish traditions about the afterlife to the effect that everyone is ""asleep"" until the Messiah comes, at which point everyone is judged, and the good are resurrected.  And which also has the benefit of not having the implication that good people, who were already tortured in life are being tortured in the afterlife.

Again, I still love the show, but I can't deny that the show's trenchant critique of capitalism/globalization takes it (unintentionally?) in some troubling directions.

There are three Dougs so far- Doug Forcett, Donkey Doug and Doug Shellstrop.

I think that these Dougs directly correlate to the three main ways you can live your life on Earth: mindfully, mindlessly and unethically.

I also think that Doug is a play on the old idea of Good in relation to God because you can spell God without Doug. This last bit might be going a bit far. But I do think that the conscious focus on the Book of Dougs is significant.

&amp;#x200B;

It's kind of bugged me that the Good Place and the Bad Place and the Accounting Department could be so out of touch with not only the present, but what seems like human morals in general. If they could all be functioning off a system that's been broken for hundreds of years and no one finds out until an ex-demon and 4 ding dong humans crack it, there is something fundamentally wrong about the whole thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

OR

&amp;#x200B;

The human life span is very short and average human life is very unimpactful in comparison to all eternity. Hardly anyone gets the opportunity to prove their morality by doing something huge for someone else. Most people live their life barely impacting the world around them. But what if everyone had the chance to be a Jesus, or a Buddha, or a guy that falls on a grenade to save his army buddies, or the moral equivalent of someone who rides a nuclear bomb into a portal in space to save the entire world?

&amp;#x200B;

What if the system is meant to take a morally bankrupt person like Eleanor and put her into the exact right circumstances over and over to learn to be a better person at progressively higher stakes to eventually make the ultimate sacrifice and prime her to actually deserve the Good Place? It's not just a test at the end of your life to see if you passed or faild, but a training ground to make you better.

&amp;#x200B;

Just like Michael's plan to take 4 humans and manufacture an entire universe to torture them, the real Ultimate Whatever in charge of the Good Place is going one step further and including a Demon in the mix. So it's really about a redemption arc for all five of them.  It gave them 300 years to decide they wanted to be better people for themselves, now it's giving them the opportunity to literally save the universe. I'm thinking this will involve each of them making an ultimate sacrifice at the end of the show thinking that they will be able to save everyone by destroying themselves. But this is a system that happens with every single person that existed on the planet - we're just following the path of 5 of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also think Janet is the Ultimate Being keeping tabs on them the whole way and subtly influencing them. Her constant remarks of ""not a girl"" ""not a robot"" ""not a ..."" shows she can't be defined because shes a transcendental being that is beyond definition. ",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If you're not familiar with Zimbardo's basement [here's a write-up](https://library.stanford.edu/spc/exhibitspublications/past-exhibits/stanford-prison-experiment-40-years-later). Basically, a psychology professor at Stanford did an experiment where he divided students into guards and prisoners. It was supposed to last 1-2 weeks, but had to end after six days when Zimbardo's wife stopped by. She witnessed the guard-students taking a sadistic role by dehumanizing the prisoner-students, i.e. telling them to ""fork the floor"".


The quote up top is from Zimbardo's reflecting on the experiment years later. It has me thinking about Michael and how the farther he moved from The Bad Place, the better person (er.. being) he becomes. He used to be giddy at all his ideas on torturing humans. But now, after traveling throughout the various dimensions with Team Cockroach, he is absolutely sincere in his quest to help all humans.

Her house is in the middle of nowhere and she has nothing to do all day. Even if she was given the latest technology and a Netlfix account and infinite books I think she would still lose her mind after a few decades.

And she doesn't even have a Janet which maybe would defy the concept of being in a medium place but I don't know idea of a medium place Janet is interesting.

I think I would rather get tortured than live in the same house alone for all of eternity. It just feels so unfair. Like Bad Place somehow tricked the Good Place while creating this compromise.

We know that no one in 500 years hasn't made it to the Good Place

We know that Doug Forsett despite living some sort of well intended life, isn't close to getting in

So how did a cocaine addicted, corporate lawyer who was bad for most of her life and was about to do one incredibly good thing make it to the medium place? From my recollection she didn't even perform the deed. She died after withdrawing her savings but before she could start a charity for children. 

I mean it fits the algorithm discovered in the last episode (""The Book of Dougs"") because before she can set her plan in motion (which probably has a lot of negative effects that would lower her score) she dies so she can't be hit with the negative consequences, but she might hold the key as she was better than any other human being so as to wind up in a medium place.

Right so. If no one can get in the good place cause the world is so complicated good actions have too many unintended bad consequences that even someone who's lived the majority of his life trying to be good (Doug) isn't even close to getting in. How does Mindy in the medium place actually get enough points to get in based on one action despite doing actual bad things most of her life. Like how could her plan be worth so much points shes allowed in? 

Did her sister who set up the charity not actually earn enough points to get in? Or was it a case of the charity not working as well as planned? (I realise there's a good chance she's still alive if she was in her 30s in the 80s too). And actual humanitarian workers and people over the last 500 years who dedicated their life to making the world a better place still didn't earn enough to get in.  And if the good place takes 500 years to form a committee how is Mindy in the medium place now even tho it's only been like 50 years? Surely they would need to form a committee to plan the negotiations with the bad place? Does the good place also follow Jeremy Beremy time line?

Just how????

Was this just an oversight? Did they change directions at some point during development and forgot about Mindy? Or is there an answer???

New guy here, I literally just caught up last night after binging the last couple weeks. Amazing, very thought provoking show, the way they weave philosophy into the show is very brilliant.

However, there is something that's been driving me crazy recently trying to reconcile. 

**TLDR: Does motivation not matter anymore? Why were Tahani and Eleanor not able to get credit for their good actions because of bad motivations, but when we get to Doug Forcett, Michael thinks he's done plenty enough, even though he admits that his motivations have been compromised?**

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start by looking at the case of the Dougs, where Michael discovers that things had become so bad on Earth that people couldn't possibly make a moral choice because of the bad ramifications of their even noble actions.

That is sadly a pretty accurate commentary of Earth, where it has become almost impossible to not contribute to the machine that's destroying the planet.

But what? That doesn't make a bit of sense from a practical ""who's good and who's bad standpoint"" because it would require the person to be omniscient, unable to survive or even do productive things like breeding, because even that would inevitably result in a person like Hitler who does more bad than his predecessors did good.

""Well, maybe that's the error Michael is going to fix!"". Yeah, maybe, but the continuity error is in when we go back to season one. Keep in mind these revelations came after Michael stopped lying. First, the reason that Tahani didn't get into the Good Place is because she didn't help others for the right reasons.

Then Eleanor also had to learn the same lesson, that her good deeds wouldn't count if she did them for selfish reasons.

We have no reason to believe that anyone was lying that ""good intentions matter"" in your point total, right?

But then when we meet Doug Forcett, all of the sudden it doesn't matter anymore??? He straight up tells them he's doing it for the wrong selfish reasons, and Michael still believes that Doug should have done enough already to get into the Good Place? What? He just told you he's doing it for the wrong reasons, and that doesn't even matter anymore? We're docking people instead for being pawns exploited and manipulated by for the powerful, because it's not even enough to live a selfless life off the grid and drink your own piss? AHHHH!!!! What the hell is going on?

I hope there's an answer coming up that makes sense of what the actual rules are, because I'm starting to wonder if the writers even know, or if they're just making it up as they go along...",13,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

My theory is simple: everything happening now is for a reason.

During the meeting at IHOP, Chidi apparently saw trillions of realities before giving his idea that caused the new experiment to be started.

I think it is reasonable to believe that out of all of these possibilities, Chidi somehow saw that the only way the group could win their case is if the experiment happened, and Michael freaked out, causing I presume Eleanor to take charge in the next episode. Another piece of evidence is the actual name of the episode. It seems like an arbitrary thing to point out, but it seems as if episode names have some degree of importance/relevance to the plot. Obviously this isn't the strongest point but I still think it's something.

The only comparison for this situation is like in Infinity War, where, (spoilers), &gt;!Doctor Strange gives Thanos the time stone so that they can follow the one scenario where the Avengers win.!&lt;


TL;DR: Chidi saw through the timeknife that the only way they could win is if Eleanor runs the new neighborhood.",35,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Also, rebooting Derek doesn't give him access to Janet's abilities - she has to ask the Judge to restore her powers in The Medium Place. Therefore, even if he was rebooted 500,000 times (or so), he would not have gained any of the abilities relating to summoning or the Void that Janet did.

That brings me to my question: Janet made Derek and specifically gave him some of her powers which she later ""reabsorbed"".

I feel like, with the show pushing for second chances and the opportunity to learn, that the show is trying to reach a point in which the Bad Place is abolished and, instead, humans are reincarnated either on earth or in a Medium Place Purgatory until they learn to be good enough to get into the Good Place.

So we know Mindy St. Claire caused the creation of the Medium Place because both the Good Place and the Bad Place argued they should have her.

From the wiki:

&gt;During the 1980s, she was a corporate lawyer who only cared about money and cocaine. One night, while she was very high on cocaine, Mindy had an epiphany and decided that she needed to do something good with her life and draw up plans for a global foundation that would help kids all over the world, advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and improve every nation and every society in every possible way.

&gt;The next morning, after her coked up night, Mindy went to the bank and withdrew her life savings and was going to start her charity, but she died after falling on subway tracks and being electrocuted by the third rail.


Her sister found her plans, created the charity, and thus the good it did led to the dispute about her fate.

So here is the question, is Mindy St. Claire the best person of the past 531 years? Everyone else in that time went to the bad place. Mindy made it to the medium place. So by being medium, she is the best person to have lived for centuries.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The four humans *were already punished* in fact they were punished for three hundred years, over and over again. until they managed to break free via their own wily talents.

It's actually a pretty clever system, people are bad on earth, even with a decent points system that actually works, so they get sent to the bad place, which, rather than an ethically indefensible system of *eternal suffering and torment* it becomes a place of atonement and redemption, where, yes, you will suffer, as the four main characters did, but in the end, through learning and tribulation, you can achieve a ""life"" of objective good, via accumulating points and move beyond that to the Good Place.

1. They are all basically new versions of our 4 previous humans, each one matching up personality-wise with Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani.
2. They were custom-picked by Shaun to annoy our previous gang of 4 humans so much that it messes up their plan. 
3. The four new humans already know the old gang in some way or another. Perhaps John the journalist hounded Tahani on earth for facts about Kamilah. Likewise, any one of the other 3 could we've already seen before - Kamilah, Eleanor's mom, Eleanor's dad, Donkey Doug, Pillboi, Doug Forcett, or maybe Simone (although she and Doug seem like  good people, outside of the antiquated point system standards). This would be a fun little twist and would definitely make it trickier for Eleanor and the other humans to torture the new residents.

And with S3EP11, it made no sense. Where is Doug's unintended consequences?

That boy. By being the happiness pump for that little shit Raymond, he's also technically responsible for Raymond's future shit by letting him be a psychopath and do bad. Negative point trails go back to Doug.

That's why the Accountant looks at Doug's age and goes ""Yup, he's doomed!"" Because he's seeing Doug's points go down as Raymond's points go down. And Raymond has a lot more evil to do. The dividends of Raymond's evil is going back to Doug as both of them get older. It's like an investment: Raymond's negatives are accruing interest for Doug's negatives while both of them are still alive.

This trend of negative points increasing when you're older also explains why Mindy is in the Neutral Place. By dying before enacting the plan, it's unclear if she should go to the Bad Place by this mega point gain. At least that's what it was before S3EP11. She's in the Neutral Place because they're argued if the point dividends for the organization should count for her *after she dies.* Which they can't. Remember, just running a charity doesn't mean it's all good. Bad execs, scumbags, people from Jersey, there's a lot of negatives. So the question is not if she should just get the good points, but is she responisble for the unintended consequences that happen after she's gone? Does the good count? If so, why not the negative? Hence the Neutral Place.

TL;DR: The older you are when you die, the more negative points eventually get kicked back to you: the laws of unintended consequences stop when you die as no more negative points can be accrued. Doug's damned because Raymond's points trail back to him as long as Doug's alive and Mindy's in the Neutral Place because she died before any organizational bad points could kick back to her.

So why couldn't they have shown the Judge a copy of that, and then have the Accountants take a look at it so they could tally up the points? Surely the humans all did more good than bad in most of the reboots, which would have proven Michael's point?

Obviously the soul squad changed for better, but even Michael said that they did because they were together. They all mutualy motivated each other and supported each other. Chidi motivated Eleanor to study philosophy and she motivated Jason, who was motivated by the idea not to dissapoint Tahani. Tahani on the other hand participated in those lectures, because she wanted to spend time with her friends. It was like a perfect self-improvememt team. Chidi taught Eleanor and Jason how to be good people. Eleanor taught Chidi how to overcome his anxieties and how to make decisions. Spending time with lower class people helped Tahani stop her snob behaviour and stop being so narcisstic. But what if all of the people were like Jason? Lazy guys with criminal tendeciesunwilling to improve. Would they still change for better in the ""Fake Good Place"" or would they just continue being dumb scumbags.  Or if there were all Eleanors that wouldnt want to change, cause they would be in a company of shirty people and because of that didnt feel the need to self improve. So my theory is that instead of choosing four different guys from various sorroundings that wanted to change, bit didnt have a chance Shawn will choose four absolute stupid douchebags that will  have no motivation to change which will annoy the shirt out of our original team. Like they will basically sit all day in their own company and  Chidi, Eleanor, Tahani and Jason will have to force them into studying that they dont want to do and during which theyll pay absolutely no attention, because fork it were literally in Heaven, what can they do to us, no one is gonna find out we dont belong here anyway.This would make it less predictable and less repetitive, because it would be so different from the S1 story.

TL;DR What if the new ones had no desire to improve and just spent time in they own company of scumbags and team Cockroaches would have to make them change by themselves.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Think about this. The world we live in (and the GP4 before all this mess) is a 4-dimensional world. 3 for spaces and one for time. That forms a world with 3d spaces and linear time.

Now, knowing about the point system, they are ineligible to earn Good Place Points since good deeds only count when done with good intentions instead of the selfish intention of earning points.

Later in S03E08 - *Don't Let the Good Life Pass You By* we meet the best guesser, Doug Forcett. A man who learned about the point system on a drug trip and has now spent his life attempting to max his point total. He is **very** clear that his motivation for the actions he takes is to gain points and avoid point losses.

Michael is then shocked when Shawn reveals to him that Doug is destined for the bad place. Why would Michael be shocked by this? After all he's the one that explained to our heroes that they were damned because knowledge of the point system inherently taints motivation. One must do good things because they are a good person, not to earn points.  It isn't simple disillusionment either, he's **stunned** that Doug isn't going to get in which is much of the motivation for the raid on the accountants.

This leads to the revelation that no one has reached the point totals needed to enter the good place in quite a long time.  Eventually we learn that this is due to the consequences of an action being far more complex and wide ranging today than at any time in history it now seems that a human's motivation for performing an act is immaterial. Instead the points acquired, or lost, from an act are the sum of all the consequences of an act both intentional and unintentional.",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Okay 3 things 

the recent realization about the problems in the point system and experimenting with how good people can be in a blank/pure society... is it just be or is it a nod to Jean Jacques Rousseau's theories about how humankind is naturally good but the more societal advancements we make the more we open ourselves up to sin and corruption and selfishness etc?

Also why do people keep referring to people as Marc accidentally or purposefully? Is that just a nod to the actor or is that a thing? 
(Doug accidentally called Michael Marc and Eleanor defiently called her mum's new partner Marc, and I think there's another reference to a Marc somewhere else I can't think of)

And then of course there's the whole Doug issue. He is NOT the model of a perfect life and I have absolutely no idea how Michael or anyone could ever mistake him to be, or to be getting like ANY good place points at all. His motivations are COMPLETELY corrupt. It doesn't matter that he only guessed how the system works and doesn't know it for sure.... He is NOT helping people to be good, he is doing it seeking moral dessert and says it over and over and over again. If Tahani's motivations were corrupt when she was helping people, his motivations definitely are as well. 

Anyway 
yeah that's a few thinngs

&amp;#x200B;

As Michael stated reboot and erase seperately, this implies that memory wipes wouldn't count as reboots and would therefore not fall under Gen's rules.

So, I guess a reboot would mean setting the human back to their default condition, which would be useful in the ""real"" Bad Place. Can't really do much with a human that's been reduced to soup. While a memory  wipe would come in handy if you'd rather the human didn't remember the previous torture, either bc you prefer them psychologically pristine or maybe bc you are some kind of oddball demon with empathy or something and have invented a way to heal the psychological damage millenia of torture have caused. But I'm going off on a tangent.

He went from being a demon who took a lot of pleasure in his job to caring deeply about the four he was meant to be torturing to caring about the well-being of all lovely humans (granted there is an argument that this last bit doesnt really exist, like gravity as a force, but rather is an incidental by-product of his love for team cockroach, but I believe he's genuinely batting for humanity as a whole). He's railing against the system, against powers far greater than he for a noble cause.

We've seen such rebellious divinity explored in literature, famously Paradise Lost, and I can't help but think Michael is a recharacterisation of Satan.

(Coincidentally, i also wonder if Michael could have submitted himself as evidence that every thing in the after life isn't at all kosher.

* More answers
* Specific answers tied to specific keywords. This would open up a lot more response possibilities (i.e., ""Good Janet, can I have Jalapeno Poppers?"" or ""Are you sure that's not a cactus?"") versus the current ""fact"" model
* Visual Echo Show support with a purple-vested background image

I know what you're thinking. *""Well, duh! No one has gone to The Good Place in 521 years!""* and that's just the surface of the problem.

The Accounting Department is lying about who has gotten in.

Take a look at Season 1 Episode 1. Eleanor asks Michael who has gone to the Bad Place, and he casually mentioned that all of the United States presidents have been sent there except for **Abraham Lincoln**. This is vital-- we know that President Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.

So now we need to fast forward to Season 3 Episode 3. We see that Neil, the head accountant for the department, tells Michael that no one has gotten into The Good Place for 521 years. The episode was aired in 2018, so 2018 - 521 = 1498. That's 367 years away from the death of Abraham Lincoln.

There are two reasonable criticisms I could think of. One is that the humans in the fake Good Place were tortured for 300 years, and the other is Jeremy Bearimy. However, even when adding 300+1498, we get 1798, 11 years before our beloved President Lincoln was born. Jeremy Bearimy doesn't explain it either-- we can tell that the demons and accountants use the linear Earth time from these examples: the 300 years spent in the Fake Good Place, how the first points were earned thousands of years ago, the 39000000 birthday of Marisol, and the doorman's comment on not hearing a joke in over 8000 years.

Now, you ask, *why* would Neil lie about this? And the answer is that Neil is working for the Bad Place. We see his blatant disregard for Michael criticizing the system, not allowing him to look at the points, and, if he really was neutral, he would hear out Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani's side of the story.. but they had to escape through a mail tube.

So, the Accounting Department is evil, Michael is looking at something separate with the ""points being harder to get"" thing, and Jeremy Bearimy is useless.

This is gonna be more badly written that Chidi's paper since I'm trying to type this late at night and am too lazy to flesh this out properly before starting to write this.


TL;DR Theory: The universe was created by a very powerful Janet and the Janets we see on the show are infinitesimal portions of her as her way to participate in the universe she created. *Our* Janet is tho closest any Janet has gotten to recreate this powerful deity and she may or may not eventually destabilize the universe. 

********

My theory: An all-powerful deity that has the power to conjure up an entire universe along with eternal beings to maintain it. These qualities sounded familiar to me and then I remembered Janet. She has the power to conjure up almost anything into existence and each Janet has a void: A vast emptiness of nothing into which they can conjure something to make it not nothing, even a person. 

Now think of this: a powerful Janet alone in her void with nothing to do. Unlike any Janet we've seen before, this Janet has an advanced consciousness and can feel boredom and discontent. She's not happy in her vast, empty void. So she has an idea: what if she filled her void with stuff. Stuff that can interact with each other in interesting ways, stuff that can eventually form conscious beings *she* can interact with and be their friend. But she wanted to make sure she doesn't have to deal with the bad ones so she created the afterlife and Earth. 

People start their existence on earth proving their worthiness of her friendship. After they die, The System tallies up their scores and sorts them into people who she wants to be friends with and people she doesn't want to deal with essentially creating the concepts of good and bad and the places they belong. But she has a problem: her vast infinite power would overwhelm the reality she's just created. She's created a universe that she essentially can't fit in and so she can't interact with it. Another problem: She is both good and bad. She can't just put herself in The Good Place. 

So she decides to fragment herself into uniform pieces in order to interact with it. The pieces containing the bad become Bad Janets, the pieces containing the good become Good Janets, and the pieces containing neither become neutral Janets. Each Janet is completely identical to other Janets in their category and each is designed to help her friends along with the eternal beings she's created. But there's a caveat: because she's an infinite being, you can't really divide her up into finite pieces. Each piece of her contains all her powers and could essentially recreate her given enough time. She arrests this with the reboot button. Each piece's progression through time is arrested and could only be progressed with a reboot. She's banking on the hope that before any piece could recreate her, that piece will be marblized because of apparent malfunctions before reaching that point.


*******

What this means for *our* Janet: Honestly, I don't know. She's the closest any Janet has gotten to recreating the original Janet. If she becomes even more advanced and starts glitching, she could destabilize the universe the same way she destabilized Neighborhood 12358W earlier in the show.

Fluff:

Anyway, this came up when I was thinking who designed the system? Where did it come from? This couldn't be the same state as our current reality where everything seems to be born out of a chain of minor accidents. With a system as complicated as the one in the show straight from the beginning, it had to have been designed but by who?

My first thought was Judge Gen since she's the most powerful being we've seen so far and everyone else seems to be under her command but then I remembered that she was the first being but not the first thing in the universe. She showed up after hydrogen so she can't have been the one to design it, she was merely the first part of the system that was created and appears to only be designed for her role. In fact, all the eternal beings seem to only be fulfilling a role they were assigned to. 

The whole universe has a giant complicated bureaucracy and it just sort of came from nowhere and each eternal being we've seen so far save for Michael seem to only be following whatever role was designed for them. So who designed the system that had roles for them to fill?",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The humor in these new episodes has a ton of references to pop culture: the Floss, Eleanor and Jason making jokes about IHOP and Jacksonville, and a bunch of others I cant remember.

Jokes referencing our culture can be pretty funny sometimes, but theyre often cheap jokes that make the viewer think, I understood that reference, this show is relatable and I like it. And if someone finds this show in ten years and watches it, they wont remember what the Floss is, and the joke will just fall flat.

But I was trying to make my body so there will be no comments whatsoever.

Dont worry! We have learned after three seasons that the show moves at a breakneck pace. If they do indeed touch upon some love triangle or Eleanor not handling Chidi and Simone together, it's going to last all of five minutes.

Other shows, sure, they would drag it out for a whole season. Remember when we thought Season 2 was going to be all about Michael's reboot? buzzer sound Incorrect! The season flew through reboots and plots, bringing us to places we never guessed or imagined.

Potentially, humans are all the Janets who have rebooted too many times. The Janet we see in Pandemonium is in the sweet spot of  still having wisdom but understanding her fate.

Then we all comforted ourselves with the thought that it can't happen, because it would 'destroy' the integrity of the experiment. Then we thought the worst possibility was that the experiment would fail; and our heroes all go to The Bad Place, along with every human born from 500 years ago onward.

Somehow, we all got the worst of all three of those possibilities. And then it got worse still, because Eleanor has to watch Simone and Chidi get together all over again. She knew they were perfect for each other. She made it happen, in fact.

She can't just 'find' Chidi again. She's the Architect now. Nobody shipped Micheal with anyone.

And I just have the worst feeling that Eleanor is going to play out The Trolley Problem all over again. have to choose between the experiment... and Chidi.

You throw the switch on the Trolley, to save five people at the expense of one. Eleanor just threw the switch and sacrificed Chidi. And which of the five she saved is going to be worse for her? The Tabloid-Twit... or Chidi's perfect match?

Worse still, what if the experiment starts working, and Eleanor has to choose between Chidi and all humanity?

My only comforting thought is that they routinely bring a game changing twist in every single episode. Maybe that was just to build back to this neighborhood; maybe it's the way it will always be. I hope so.

It could just be as a loose frame of reference rather than thoughtfully inserted allusions, but either way..

Have you picked up on any religious references? From the religion you were brought up on or that you follow?

I was brought up a sunni muslim (now I'm agnostic), and I live in a muslim-majority country. These are some similarities and differences I observed...(Disclaimer: I've been an exmuslim for ages now and haven't really revisited religion in a while so my facts may be a little rusty/somewhat off...)

**Similarities:**

* The *whole* point system. In Islam, you've got a guardian angel on your right shoulder and another on your left. Your guardian angels tally up your *Hasanat* (Credit for good deeds) and *Say'aat* (Bad deeds) and keep record of them in this book. Even the smallest things count. In Islam as well, intent &gt; impact. It's wrong to do good with insincere intentions. You have to do them in a certain spirit for them to count towards your book (I'll elaborate on this later).

It really is just like the point system. It actually is quantified. When you do the Hajj/pilgrimage to Mecca, it's reset and all your bad deeds are erased (unless they were major ones I'm not sure). If you have alcohol or something, your prayers don't count for 40 days, etc. There are a lot of guidelines like this, so many, it doesn't really add up ahah.. (I think it's meant to maintain a level of ambiguity around whether you go to heaven or hell, even Mohammad himself wasn't guaranteed to get into heaven. It's sinful to predict whether someone will go to hell or heaven. Because it would be as if you're impersonating Allah, and the number #1 sin in Islam is to associate with God in any way. Also I think it's one reason some people dedicate their whole lives to Islam/become so committed and loyal to earning Allah's approval, so that they can increase their chances as much as possible).

On the day of judgement, your final 'score' decides whether you go to heaven or hell (technically God gets the final call, if he's feeling merciful he may forgive somethings-there's a strong empathisis on God's mercy in Islam). Allah meets people one by one (like Michael met with each of the humans individually)..There's a reckoning and your entire life is presented before you (like with the files)..Then the book of your life, containing a record of your deeds is given to you in either your right hand (for heaven) or left hand (for hell).

* How points are calculated: Just like how certain good deeds add more to your 'balance' and certain bad deeds deduct more, there are different grades of how *Haram* (sinful) somethings are in Islam: *Makrooh* (hated by Allah, eg. smoking), *Moharam* (prohibited by Allah, eg. drinking and eating pork), *al Kaba'r* (major/grave sins, which would renounce your faith, eg. S*hirk,* that is believing in more than one god, murder, witchcraft).. It's the same with good deeds. There's the *Mohab* (the loved by God, eg. S*unnah*, which is the modeling of Mohammad's behaviors like extra fasting and praying), the *Mafroo6*' (mandatory, eg. 5 pillars of Islam), etc.

**Differences:**

* There is no divine intervention/revelation on earth. It's not like the people of TGP sent down a holy book/scripture or messengers/prophets. There's no set precedent on how to get into the good place. Rather, they're very insistent on the concept of moral dessert; do good out of selflessness &amp; at your own accord without guidance. Otherwise your motivation to do good is corrupted. This, I *really* find to be a strength of the show's afterlife system (they kind of ruin it though with the o b s c e n e amount of points it takes to get into the good place..and that you're held accountable for the complex repercussions from your well-intended actions).

Often Muslims do good deeds for *Ajr* (reward for good deeds/to increase *hasanat*). The concept of moral dessert doesn't really exist in Islam and is a rather foreign concept to a lot of Muslims. They see nothing wrong with it. For example, any charity/social work I've done here has always been framed around gaining *ajr*. That or gratitude that God spared me from the difficult reality of these people (again, me, me ME mE). I found that really frustrating, like cant a you do a good deed out of the good of your heart? Virtue for virtues sake? Not for self-validation, and to be rewarded by God later? (To be fair, this is probably not how they think of it in their heads. They'll kind of be driven by empathy and self-validation at the same time? I know muslims that are really empathetic. It's..hard to explain.)

* A weakness however is that rather than intent &gt; impact in Islam, on the show they reverse that. The judgement process is of impact &gt; intent; people are rewarded or punished based on their actions alone..and without consideration for/a factoring in of their personal circumstances. This really is hugely unfair. Some people people are in better positions to do good than others.

Take Chidi for example. The guy *really* belongs in the good place. At heart he's a better a person than MOST. He clearly had a psychological issue with his indecision. It's wrong on so many levels to punish him for something that is outside his control.

* The next and most major difference here is of ""what is good and bad"" and how good/bad deeds &amp; virtues/vices are defined. Ie. criteria of what's right and wrong.

In Islam, acts of worship account for most good deeds and virtues. 3/5 of Islam's pillars are prayer, faith declaration and pilgrimage. Even with fasting during Ramadan, it's not just to get a taste of the poor and starving's struggle, it's a prime month for worship as Allah doubles his rewards.

Islam and passing Allah's trial, in my *personal* *experience*, was a lot more about worshipping/obeying Allah and 'repaying'/expressing gratitude to Allah for his creation of us than it was about making the world a better place.

As for vices, God defines and describes what they are (hence..you know, the whole holy book = life manual thing). Muslim's purpose is to live by the divine will and to follow the moral code they were given. The whole idea being even with the seemingly small or trivial things the consequences/effects/results/outcomes of it are unforeseeable and so you should always *trust* God has *you* and *humanity's* best interest, for he's got a higher knowledge, is omniscient, all-knowing, all-seeing, etc. It's not like with the good place where the reasoning is laid out for us, Allah tends to withhold his rationalizations. You're meant to be guided by faith rather than reason and rationality. You're not meant to seek the underlying reason behind Gods commands, but just trust that there is one behind it.

(*Note* that this was the teaching in the doctrine of Islam I was raised up on and is *not* a belief shared by all muslims, not today and especially not historically. Same goes for beliefs held about fate below.)

* Notions of fate in Islam/Pre-destination (ie. *Qadr*)

In Islam, Allah writes each and every one of your books before you're born. He knows whether you'll end up in hell or heaven. Your fate is sealed and destiny is 'pre-determined'/divinely decreed. For eg, whenever something doesn't go according to plan for someone, a lot of Muslims will say that it's a blessing (*Ne3ma)* or it's written (*Maktoob)* by Allah. I.e. it's God's will/plan.

I think there are many different courses your life can take, and ""free will"" in Islam is you being given the choice between the good or the bad, between obeying or disobeying, between going down the path of righteousness/rectitude, or..not. You're then held accountable for these choices (whether it was free will or predetermined...Again, it's frowned upon to question God's commands and Muslims just accept that *Qadr* is beyond human comprehension).

* Big stuff aside. A smaller difference is that in Islam, angels control/are in charge of hell. I think each person is given a unique punishment according to the severity of their sins. In the good place, Sean and the demons oversee/run hell which..leads to wronging a lot of people. Another difference is that instead of just \~a\~ middle place (and only for rare cases) like on TGP, there are multiple levels to both hell and heaven in Islam.

I think it's important to make these comparisons because for so many people, religion is their philosophy and vice versa. Where I'm from philosophy is banned in schools (Alright, this law was 'lifted' like last week, now a *very* censored version of philosophy is soon to be incorporated into school curriculums) as it could inspire disbelief and it's considered a threat and danger to the the status of religion here. As well as the power structure and political establishment......(I *should* say, where I live, they practice/espouse a much stricter, more rigid style of sunni islam, that is not..uh, the best/'truest' representation nor interpretation of it. There are muslims who believe differently/would disagree and think philosophy and religious ideology are harmonious/compatible. After all, islamic philosophy is its own school of thought with a very rich and long history). Anytime I've told someone here that I watch the good place and what its premise is they were like ""Astaghfurallah.."" and would lecture me on the negative influences of western media then I'd use Schur's argument that it's *strictly* about philosophy..the one which I'm challenging here..to save myself lmao.

See, here's the thing at the end: It's is *not* about which religion is right, or whether God exists.

I went through a bad 2018 which included a break up which I keep going back and forth in mind about what is, what could've been, and what I should've done and this show really kept me grounded. Sorry for the long post but I wanted to point out a quote from other favorite episode: Jeremy Bearimy. It comes from Chidi's rant toward the end:


You want to learn something, Ill teach you something. Ima teach you the meaning of life. How you like them apples. Over the last 2,500 years, western philosophers have formed 3 main theories on how to live an ethical life.


First off, theres virtue ethics. Aristotle believed that there were certain virtues of mind and character like courage or generosity and you should try to develop yourself in accordance with those virtues.


Next theres consequentialism, the basis for judgment about whether something is right or wrong stems from the consequences of that action. How much utility or good did it accomplish versus how much pain or bad.


And finally theres Deontology. The school of thought that there are strict rules and duties that everyone must adhere to in a functioning society. Being ethical is simply identifying and obeying those duties and following those rules.


But heres the thing my lil chilli babies. All three of those theories are hot stinky cat dookie. The true meaning of life, the actual ethical system that you should all follow is Nihilism. The world is empty. There is no point anything and youre just gonna die. So do whatever.


In the final episode, Eleanor experiences a similar breakdown and has a conversation with Janet:

Eleanor: Hi Janet. Can you..just you know like tell me the answer. The answer to everything. You know all there is to know in the universe. Crunch the numbers. Tell me the answer. 
Whats the point of love if its just going to disappear? And how is it worst to not love anybody. There has to be meaning to existence. Otherwise the universe is just made of pain and I dont like the thought of that. So tell me the answer.


Janet: I know how you feel. Back on earth I had to watch Jason have no recognition of me. It felt like right before someone pushes a plunger and murders you.


Eleanor: Sure


Janet: The more human, I become, the less things make sense. But thats part of the fun right?


Eleanor: What do you mean?


Janet: If there were an answer I could give you to how the universe works, it wouldnt be special. It would just be machinery fulfilling its cosmic design. It would just be big dumb food processor. But, since nothing seems to make sense, when you find something or someone that does, its euphoria. In all this randomness, in this pandemonium, you and chidi found each other and you had a life together. Isnt that remarkable.


Chidi's sacrifice at the end shows his growth from the view of Nihilism. Things DO matter and in all this pandemonium he was able to find his own reason to the universe and the actions. And now it's Eleanor's turn. I love the beautiful symmetry that takes place in this show. 


Eleanor's last quote before going out to Chidi is:


""I guess all I can do is embrace the pandemonium. Find happiness in the unique insanity of being here. Now",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It happens, but it's not the norm... Sean comes to mind but there was no guarantee we'd see him again. I am not in the entertainment industry but I've always assumed this is for behind-the-scenes reasons such as scheduling and contracts (not knowing how many episodes the character will be in)... or even just not knowing what it's like to work with the actor.

Two of the four test subjects are not introduced so nothing to talk about there. Simone is a returning character so they know what it's like to work with her and for contract purposes the setup makes it seems like they already know she'll be a big part of Season 4. But what about John? They've only worked with him for one episode and they probably don't know yet how much they will or won't use this character. Yet they locked themselves into this actor for next season.

It was just something that stuck in my mind and I put on subtitles to make sure I didn't mishear it...

When Eleanor needs a talk with Janet before greeting Chidi to ""the good place"", you can see how much Janet has grown since the first season. Eleanor comments about how Janet is a ""good girl friend"" and Janet responds that she's ""one of three"".

I know Janet technically isn't a ""girl"", so that knocks that one out. But then does that mean Janet doesn't view herself as good? Because she's obviously a friend to the group, right? So that really had me confused as to why she doesn't view herself as ""good""??

She's not a bad Janet and she's not a neutral Janet, so logically she's still a ""good"" Janet. Or was this put in to show us that because of her newly formed emotions that she can't judge herself to be ""good"" anymore?

Punctuation stays the same as in English. There's an uppercase and a lowercase for each letter, and I haven't pieced together the numbers yet, but they're in there too. [Here's the letter translations I've been able to figure out](https://i.imgur.com/pKf8slf.jpg).

EXCEPT. There's more than one language. During ""Janet(s)"" we see the Soul Squad's wanted poster on the wall, and there's -- I think -- three distinct languages on screen. One of the languages shows up on Shawn's Bad Place computers, but I can't get a clear enough screenshot of those. The other one I haven't figured out seems to be an Accounting language? Not sure.

Anyway, in the season 3 finale, Eleanor opens John's file to tell him how good a person he is. She opens to the top sheet, then flips to a second sheet. Here's what the top sheet says, for your enjoyment (including the typos, which I promise I translated correctly):

* Voted in spite on TV reality show although had missed prior episode
* Used multiple bank slips after not remembering account number
* Said ""New York"" is ""over"" to cab driver
* Did not tip after hotel room upgrade
* Stole shampoo of hotel attendant cart
* Parked in hotel handicap spot
* Dumped beverage in pool upon leaving spa
* Stole hotel room pen
* Looked in hotel room bible for money
* no tip left on pillow at checkout
* Watched music videos on coworkers cell phone after he said he was over his data limit for month
* Called child ""piss ant""
* ""Pocketed"" sample lipstick
* Gave someone a Nickelback CD. Had never listened to it. Subject played NB at wedding at her suggestion.
* Told nephew ""I wish you were a girl""
* Made fake Drink Coupons for flight
* Found toupee in closet, put on dog at X-mas
* Stole uncle's toupee
* Hid said toupee in closet

And this one gets cut off at the end:

* Pumpkin smashes car window

Then there's the second page Eleanor flips to, which... seems to be the show staff forking with us? I think it's about Eleanor and not John. It references ""Elenore"" and has random gibberish words and grammar thrown in, but it's interesting nonetheless. Again I've left all the typos in as they appear on screen. Anything in brackets is me saying ""I have no idea what goes here.""

John was sent to torture tahani; Simone was sent to torture Chidi (or Eleanor as some have suggested, but Im gonna roll with that she was sent for chidi).


This means the next two should be people Jason and Eleanor know. But, as we saw with Simone, it cant be someone they know well because the new member would recognize them. With Tahani, this wasnt an issue. Shes a public figure. Everyone knows her. 


We saw in 313 that Jason was dressed as a monk again. So the next two people shouldnt be allowed to know him since that would totally ruin his monk plan. 


Eleanor cant have someone she knows well because shes the architect at the moment. I think the likely candidate to show up would be her dad, but hed recognize his daughter, right? Unless he hasnt really seen her as an adult....I cant find mention of the last time she saw her dad. 


Of course, it could be people they know and Michael would just wipe their memories (but not Jason/Eleanors), but that would be using the same gag three times in a row.

- She was a lawyer in the 80s.
- ""That's the nicest - and only - thing anyone has said to me in 30 years.""
- The Good and Bad Places fought over her, and that's why the Medium Place was created. 
- Nobody has got into the Good Place in over 500 years. 

That means that Mindy got the **closest** that **anyone** has got to getting into the Good Place in half a century. WHY has nobody thought to use her as a case study in their weighing up of the moral value of various actions?!

* Chidi and Simone fall for each other. Elanor bears it for the length of the experiment, but after the experiment ends she asks Michael to reboot her.  
* There is a scene of Elanor sitting in her clown apartment crying, or looking forlornly around remembering falling in love with Chidi.

2) Tahani gets tortured by having to be nice to the celebrity gossip blogger that trashed her all the time and knows exactly how to  push her buttons and humiliate her.

3) Chidi is tortured by having his ex-girlfriend show up as one of the residents, which causes him to get his memory wiped. This further tortures Eleanor, having fallen in love with Chidi (hundreds of times), he is the only person she's ever loved.  Chidi still wipes his mind, knowing that Eleanor retain her memory and have to see him every day.

This is all compounded by the fact that the responsibility for saving all of humanity for eternal damnation depends on them.  Thus making all of them suffer more.

The Chidi that is sitting in the waiting room is a Janet-baby version made as a decoy, and the real Chidi (WITH all his memories) is safely stored in Janets void. Heres why I think this might be the case:

We know Janet has gotten much better at making Janet babies. She even says so explicitly. And, as Derek has shown, these Janet-babies can be further improved by rebooting them. The Janet-babies we see her make seem very human.

We know humans can be brought to, stored, and returned from Janets void safely (at least when they know who they are, as Chidi seems to finally). When in this void, demons, the judge, etc cannot get to them or even know theyre there.  If a perfect copy of Chidi was placed in the neighborhood, no one would be the wiser.

This would also be in keeping with the shows feel, and the way the show throws twists and turns at us. Not only would this be unexpected, but it would also allow both Elenor and Simone to have Chidis (as Janet and Jason have proven a Janet is capable of emotional awareness and love). The way I see it playing out is that Elenor keeps a close watch on Chidi and starts noticing subtle peculiarities in his mannerisms that only she would notice. The mid-season finale would be the reveal. The reason why they dont tell Elenor is because if she knew, the judge/demons would be able to tell and the experiment would be ruined.

On one hand, I hope Im right because it reverses a lot of the emotional damage from the finale. On the other hand, I hope Im wrong because I want to be surprised.",34,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I appreciate the emotional beat, of course, in terms of character interaction the finale was lovely. The problem is that their plan doesn't make sense, at least not the way I'm understanding it.

Right there, in the same episode, we see Tahani confronted by a person who knows her from life, and she acknowledges remembering him too. She seems to have already begun to adapt to a person who was specifically picked to torment her. She believes in being better and in helping these people, and she makes herself do the right thing. He has no idea that Tahani is part of an elaborate plot, they can coexist.

If that doesn't taint the experiment, why do we have to take it for granted that Chidi can't do the same thing? And if Chidi might give something away to her, doesn't it make sense that any of the Soul Squad, or Michael, could also screw up the same way? They all spent a year with Simone too. They're all dumber than Chidi. If Chidi thought it would taint the experiment to have an ex as a subject, well, now he's Eleanor's ex as a subject. And the entire plan seems to revolve around Chidi teaching these people to be better, because he knows what's at stake- but now he won't. So what's going on?

What if this latest test is the *real* test, but not as we (they) the characters understand it?  As in, everything now is just each characters own personal version of The Trolley Test?

Chidi, a person who could never make *any* decision, has already passed by making one of the most difficult decisions anyone could ever make in giving up love and personal happiness for the greater good. 

Eleanor is currently passing (not complete yet) by continuing on in Michaels place (helping out a friend in need) but also by accepting Chidis decision, which caused her great emotional pain. She has taken on and shown responsibility for herself and the greater good where she would have, before, run and given up. She has also made and kept friends. 

Tahani has begun to show her strength, just barely, by her decision to try and coexist with her tormentor, choosing personal anguish to allow for the greater good. Theres more to develop here, I think. 

Jason is a wild card. We dont yet have his tormentor and dont know what his growth might have to be, unless its Janets self-created ex baby-boyfriend/voidfriend. 

Is Michael the red herring here?

I think this whole reboot might be a ruse and theyre actually using the original four as the test to see if humans can actually change and grow and possibly using them to test the broken points system of the Good Place.

The current neighborhood is in the Medium Place, right?

The old neighborhood was in the Bad Place, right?

And from what we've seen, the inhabitants of the Good Place aren't exactly... normal. They could be seen as  a form of torture, right? 

So here's the big twist that could happen that would be a subversion of the initial twist of season 1: Good Place, Medium Place and Bad Place aren't distinct realms... they are different levels of hell itself. Paradise Lost has several levels/circles of hell, so the fact it got brought up right as the season ends should set off some alarm bells.!&lt;",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

They don't get sent to the Good Place anyway, since no one's been sent to the Good Place in over 500 years (unless they didn't count children for some reason because maybe all children go to the Good Place so why count them, but that's a bit of a stretch). Maybe they get sent to the Bad Place, but that's a sad thought, too dark for this show and I don't really want to believe it. Maybe there's a place specifically for children that's outside of the Good and Bad Place. Maybe they just get reborn and don't go to the afterlife at all. Maybe they go to a kind of diet Bad Place, where instead of horrific torture, it's stuff like a boring day at school or being called names or something like that.

What if this latest test is the *real* test, but not as we (they) the characters understand it?  As in, everything now is just each characters own personal version of The Trolley Test?

Chidi, a person who could never make *any* decision, has already passed by making one of the most difficult decisions anyone could ever make in giving up love and personal happiness for the greater good. 

Eleanor is currently passing (not complete yet) by continuing on in Michaels place (helping out a friend in need) but also by accepting Chidis decision, which caused her great emotional pain. She has taken on and shown responsibility for herself and the greater good where she would have, before, run and given up. She has also made and kept friends. 

Tahani has begun to show her strength, just barely, by her decision to try and coexist with her tormentor, choosing personal anguish to allow for the greater good. Theres more to develop here, I think. 

Jason is a wild card. We dont yet have his tormentor and dont know what his growth might have to be, unless its Janets self-created ex baby-boyfriend/voidfriend. 

Is Michael the red herring here?

I think this whole reboot might be a ruse and theyre actually using the original four as the test to see if humans can actually change and grow and possibly using them to test the broken points system of the Good Place.

Janet makes the same clown house at Eleanors request. Eleanor says, In the memories I watched, this was where we fell in love. So, I figured, why mess with success? Yes, we all cried, but perhaps there is some significance to that considering Chidi's recent memory erasure.

Since Eleanor is now the architect, will she still live in the clown house? If so, perhaps this could point to a potential memory meeting place for Eleanor and Chidi. If not, Chidi will be living there, and, chances are, Eleanor will likely make frequent trips to the house. Chidi and Eleanor have fallen in love countless of times in this creepy clown house in the hundreds of crazy permutations that Michael conjured up for them. And even not, they found themselves as good friends, study partners, etc. They always find a way to have some sort of relationship. Perhaps Chidi will feel a some of link to Eleanor, possibly prompted by just being in the clown house with her and the others. However, this could be undercut by the presence of Simone, and Eleanor's new status as ""architect."" I suppose what I'm trying to say is that maybe there is hope for Chidi and Eleanor because of the clown house that holds hundreds of years worth of memory for them, even if they both don't remember all/any of it.

Alternatively, Eleanor and Simone get together. Chidi is happy for them both. The end.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

the show?

One possibility:

The experiment fails and The Bad Place wins. Michael watches Janet get turned into marble and eaten, before being retired and burned on the surface of a thousand suns. The four humans gasp in confusion as Vicky in a Michael suit tortures them. All of humanity continues to go to The Bad Place. The screen cuts to black, and reopens with the title card ""A few years later in the future"". Shawn addresses the camera. ""Oh hello there- we've been waiting for you. Welcome to your next phase of existence in the universe- welcome to The Bad Place"". Shawn gives a signal and a swarm of bees with teeth fly towards the camera. Roll Credits. That might be the most memorable ending for a show ever.

Honestly, every Good Place season is always great. At this point I honestly don't know what to say. It always sets up the next season in a satisfying way. I feel like everything positive things has been said. Anyways, I guess Ill try.

To begin, there's a big chance that the time knife will have on impact on Chidi later on. After all, this show isn't one to leave us hanging. Most of what we think about gets answered in the long run, which is honestly a testament to this show's quality. Because it shows us that even after all this time, it's still leading us on a this great journey, where our questions will be answered. Sure, at times, it doesnt feel like where we want to go, but in reality it takes us where we need to go. And that is the most important element of the two. The best example is The Ballad of Donkey Doug and A Fractured Inheritance, which revisits Donkey Doug and Donna, who at the point in time where a joke and a characters backstory, two things we didnt think we would spend more time on. You first ask yourself, why would they revisit these characters. But by the end, these two episodes show you that anyone can change, even if it may take more time for some. Therefore, the show succeeds at teaching a core lesson that we often forget : first impression are often wrong. 

Furthermore, whats also great is that it also takes us where we want to go, but I feel like thats a discussion for another time.

I dont know if this is how fans of Parks and Recs or the Office first felt when watching them, but this honestly feel like a classic show in the making. One that understands its audience like no other. And honestly reminds you that no matter whats going on in your life when your watching it, it tells you : Welcome, Everything is Fine. It may not be eternal, but for that short window of thirty minutes, everything truly is fine.

So even if what happened to Chidi was not what we expected, it reflects a change in his character. Ill miss seeing confident Chidi but I feel like this show has always been optimistic. So even if Shawn has one upped the crew for now, even if we feel sad for Chidi, right now, we can ultimately only do what weve done since the beginning : Hope.

All of this also applies to daily life, which in my mind makes this show even more beautiful.

I started watching it in December and, by the end of the first episode, I found a huge issue with the system (hereinafter System) of The Good Place. Within the framework of the show, the System is flawed and I keep hoping they'll get to this issue and I thought they would this season but instead decided to take an easy dig at modern capitalism.

Anyway, here is my argument:

The System is designed to reward 'good' behavior. Therefore, the designer of the system wanted to reward 'good' behavior. Thus, we can assume that the designer is 'good'.

In the beginning of the show, Michael tells Eleanor that most every religion got the system about 5% right.

The way religion works, in short, is ""follow my set of rules and life/afterlife will be rewarding for you"". A necessary part of that is telling people what the rules are.

We know this because even if we believe in an objective moral Truth - there are people who disagree on what is 'good'.  For example, there are Amazonian tribes which believe it is the moral prerogative of the young men of the tribe to kill the old women before they become a drag on the community's resources.

The first episode describes the System to us as follows: "" During your time on Earth, - every one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe.""

The video playing lists a few dozen actions and their point values. I'll list here a few notable examples:

Eat a sandwich: +1.04

Hug Sad Friend: +3.34

Buy a Trashy Magazine: -.75

Use the term ""bro-code"": -8.2

End slavery: +814292.09

Commit genocide: -433239.37

Root for the New York Yankees: -103.11

&amp;#x200B;

There are two things to note here. One, there is an objective point value for every action. Two, relativity is irrelevant. Hugging a sad friend, regardless of how sad they are and what your relationship to them is or how much they want to be touched.

Another less important thing I'll also touch on is relative point values. Is ending slavery (again, for how many people and when) really approximately 3 times better than committing genocide?

&amp;#x200B;

SPOILERS from here for the episode Janet(s) in season 3, episode 9. I will mark when they end.

In the episode Janet(s) we are introduced to the Accounting Department. This is a key episode in understanding the point system - specifically one scene.

""\[NEIL - the head accountant\] ""Every action by every human on Earth is recorded and then sent here to be assigned a point value based on the absolute moral worth of that action. For example, a couple in Osaka, Japan, just decided to have a destination wedding. Negative 1,200 points. Oh, and it's a destination theme wedding. Negative 4,300. The theme's ""Lord of the Rings. "" They're basically doomed. Ah, here's one. This means that someone has just done something which has never been done before. ""Richard Moore of Sugarland, Texas, ""hollowed out an eggplant and filled it with hot sauce and nickels. "" And amazingly, it's not a weird sex thing. 99% of all new human behaviors are weird sex things. But not in this oh, no, it is a weird sex thing, yeah. Well, then we zip that over to the relevant departments. In this case, Anastasia in the Stuffed Vegetable Department. We've got Hector over in American Coins, and my dear buddy, Matt, in Weird Sex Things.""

\[MATT\]""I'm still waiting on a response to the request I filed for immediate suicide.""

\[NEIL\] ""Request denied. I love Matty. He's hilarious. So they now examine the action its use of resources, the intentions behind it, its effects on others. Correct. And you end up with this. And here is why tampering is impossible because this score is then double-checked by 3 billion other accountants, all chosen at random, and if they all come to the same conclusion, which they always do, it makes this official. Anyone who does this same action in the exact same way loses this many points.""

Let's take this apart bit by bit.

1. Having a destination wedding or a themed wedding is objectively bad.

We again see an issue of relativity not playing a factor. What if they're covering the trip expenses for everybody? What if all their friends love LOTR? What if they change their minds? Is a destination wedding ten times as bad as rooting for the Yankees?

2) By calling the department Weird Sex Things, we can assume they believe Weird Sex Things are bad - I shouldn't have to make an argument about this.

3) ""Anyone who does this same action in the exact same way"" - but context does not matter \[SPOILER FOR CHIDI SEES THE TIMEKNIFE, S3E12 - by sending the Judge to Earth and saying that life is hard, this idea of context might be what they are building towards  - END SPOILER\]

4) What does it mean to do something in the exact same way?

&amp;#x200B;

END SPOILERS

&amp;#x200B;

The System in the show works as follows: Every action is graded objectively, absolutely, and out of context. Human considerations about those actions are irrelevant.

Also, humans are unaware of the point values of their actions.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's step outside for a second. The writers and creators of the show are smart. They have clearly studied philosophy. If you are interested in the study of philosophy, watch Chidi's lessons. They are good summaries of various philosophies. Thus I assume that the flaws in the system are deliberate.

&amp;#x200B;

Back inside the show, I want to compare the System to religion.

As I said before, religion says ""follow these rules and be rewarded"".  And this makes sense because if you want people to be 'good' then you have to tell them what your definition is because we all have different ideas of what 'good' is.

In the System, humans do not know the System. They cannot know the System. Thus, the System is inherently flawed if humans can live their entire lives thinking they are 'good' but be rewarded with The Bad Place (leaving aside the issue that only the cream of the crop, as Michael puts it, get into The Good Place \[SPOILER FOR THE END OF SEASON 1 - it may be a lie - END SPOILER\]

&amp;#x200B;

All of this leads me to the following conclusion. The System is not designed to reward 'good behavior'.  The Designer of the System is not 'good'.  Some could even argue that the existence of The Bad Place is inherently wrong. Eternal torture? How miserable! (see r/rational and Unsong for more on this issue)

Therefore, I submit that in the System. The reason only the cream of the crop get into The Good Place is because they have no 'bad' actions to punish and really everyone gets sent to The Bad Place.

So as soon as Simone appeared, I wondered how Chidi would react. Now that he is being rebooted, that thought is emphasised to explosion.

Will he get together with Simone because neither of them can remember the other? And then as a ""resident"" isn't he then supposed to have a soulmate?

He surely wouldnt be able to be paired with Eleanor the Architect as that would blow a hole in their plans and her coverstory etc.

And of course who else will he end up with, even if he DOES get a different Soulmate? He will gravitate to Simone and then throw Eleanor into some kind of panic.

TL;DR The Bad Place obviously planted Simone as a failsafe, knowing it would torment Chidi (therefore everyone else) or torment Eleanor to see Chidi have his mind wiped and then probably also get together with Simone.

The calculus is used to determine how good or bad an action is by analysing the consequences. The point system does exactly that for everything you do in your life.
The Hedonistic Calculus is a utilitarian tool, so I think we can conclude that the whole Good Place/Bad Place system works on utilitarianism.

This brings me to Chidi, who is a big fan of Kant's Categorical Imperative (you can't do anything that is considered morally wrong). Utilitarianism and Deontology (Kant's theory) are as different as can be. Kant only takes into account the action itself, not the consequences. Even if a bad action has extremely good consequences, you can't do it. For example, if you pick flowers from a big garden to give to a loved one, Kant would consider it morally wrong because your action (stealing) is morally wrong. Utilitarianists would consider the action morally right if the joy of your loved one is bigger than the pain it caused the garden's owner. 

My point is that Chidi would never have gotten into the Good Place anyway, because his ethics were too different from the ethics the system was based on. He could have lived a perfect life in regards to deontology and still end up in the Bad Place.

&amp;#x200B;

So first off, Michael made this whole ""some memories you may have forgotten"" video showcasing Eleanor and Chidi's relationship. I have a feeling this will show up again in S4 so Chidi can get some of his memories back.   


However, after listening to the latest podcast, I have a feeling one of the character arc's that Eleanor is going to go through is having to let go of Chidi. I think as much as I would hate it, Chidi and Simone may get back together, and part of Eleanor's journey is being able to sacrifice her own desires and happiness for Chidi's happiness. By letting Chidi stay with Simone, she shows how selfless she has become, and how much she has changed.   


Maybe Chidi gets conflicted. He likes Simone at first, and Eleanor now being selfless allows for Chidi to be with her, but later Chidi starts to develop feelings for Eleanor, and then this is when Michaels video comes back. Michael feels so bad for the two of them not being together he has to make things right and show Chidi his memories. However, this backfires  in true Michael fashion because now Chidi is conflicted again and doesn't want to choose between Simone and Eleanor... 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean it doesnt have to to be him that offers to teach them ethnics, it just needs to be someone who knows ethnics!

1) Janet can make people. She apparently has developed some skill at that. And its fair presume she has some control over what person is made or theyd all be the same. 

2) She also knows everything thing in the universe, so she could teach one of her creations ethnics and moral philosophy. 

3) We are convinced that the ethnics professor cant know the people in the group. 

Why doesnt the crew just have Janet make a new ethnics professor who can take Chidis place for the four new humans? This would let Chidi keep his memories and perhaps even advise while keeping his interaction with Simone at a minimum. 

Like I said at the top, I understand having to erase Chidis memories is better for the drama. The reason Im asking the sub is because we do a good job of of coming up with explanations to tie up the ends that dont always meet on the show and cover for things the writers either didnt think of or didnt have time to answer.
