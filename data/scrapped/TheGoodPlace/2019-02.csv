&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that Michael worked with Janet to create a ""Janet Baby"" Chidi for purposes of continuing the experiment.

I also believe that the whole point of showing Janet create all her ""babies"" was to show off just how realistic of a person she could create.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the real Chidi is locked up somewhere (One of Shawn's Pods maybe) in suspended animation and will be released at the end of the experiment.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember we've been fooled by ""Fake Chidi"" before (S2 The burrito) 

&amp;#x200B;

Another variation of this theory I thought about was Michael figuring out how to like erase Chidi memories, but store them as a backup for later reinsertion.

So what Im basically inquiring after is a list. The last season of The Good Place Just finished and I am wanting to read about all the ethics discussed in the last 3 seasons. I studied philosophy as a minor at university/college with a focus on moral philosophy... I know about the basic 3 codes of ethics... but Im interested in exploring them seperate from each other as my textbooks and research just gave me the basic idea on moral ethics and not an in-depth study or much info about the philosophers/thinkers behind the concepts? Such as Peter Singer, or even Jonathan Safron Foer (i think thats the right spelling)? 

Does anyone have a list of all the philosophers and all the ethics covered so far in The Good Place?

He's an eternal being from the Bad Place who is eternally evil, and decides to turn good after \~300 years of torturing our four main protagonists? 300 years is a drop in the bucket to someone like him and it seemed like in one episode he was still evil and then in the next episode he all of a sudden wants to risk everything to help them. 

It's an interesting dilemma, because how do you turn an evil being good in a short amount of time (because it's a TV show) while making it believable? I'm totally fine with the idea of Michael being turned good and wanting to help the protagonists, it just happened way too fast for me and I would have liked them to spend more time ""turning"" Michael.

Eleanor's equivalent will be the new journalist (trashbag, obsessed with shallow things, will generally be ""himself"" but also realize he doesn't belong)

Chidi's equivalent will be Simone (academic, generally tried to do good things, will think she belongs)

Tahani's equivalent will be someone who also thinks they belong due to good works

Jason's will be someone who knows that they don't belong but wasn't intentionally malicious

Jason's equivalent I won't speculate on too much, but it did occur to me that for Tahani's equivalent we do have someone who has spent their life doing good things who will definitely think they belong and who we know for a fact is hitchhiking through rural Canada right now.

If I recall and can explain it correctly, it's the thought that you shouldn't perform a bad act, intending to perform the bad act.  It has to be a side effect of a good act.  I believe they first discuss it in S2E7 (unless I missed it somewhere earlier).  Scene starts at about 9:41, if you're looking on Netflix.

&amp;#x200B;

The winking in that scene was hilarious lmao.

Michael - ""We should tell Jason that he used to be married to Jason, and it sure would be terrible if it ultimately led to Derek's death...wink.""

&amp;#x200B;

Chidi - No.  Winking is bad.  You should not be winking.  Or saying the word wink.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I loved about this scene

\- Michael saying wink and winking, as if that doesn't spoil his motivation.

\- Eleanor winking with Michael and saying wink aloud as she's running away lmao

&amp;#x200B;

I also really like utilitarianism.  It raises interesting questions about the trolley problem if you know about the people involved (e.g., what if the one individual is a medical doctor who's temporarily working on trolley tracks and the other 5 are factory employees).  Would killing the medical doctor who intends to return to the practice of medicine result in a worse outcome, due to the lives he or she would impact?  What if the 5 employees are an integral part of trolley track safety and as a result, the company will be understaffed - which results in injury or death to future passengers?  In a vacuum, the trolley problem is straight forward for utilitarianism; it gets interesting if you have/consider more information.",4,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

-	Both are feisty, petite blondes
-	Eleanor is clearly derisive about environmental activism and is inherently selfish.  Leslie has devoted her life to the environment and to public service. 
-	Eleanors favorite food is shrimp, also likes jalapeo poppers. Leslie has a notorious sweet tooth.
-	Both women constantly make up adorable but absurd nicknames for their attractive female friends (cartoon giraffe, ,sexy skyscraper, beautiful tropical fish, beautiful, talented, brilliant, powerful musk-ox)
-	Eleanor hates office parties, hates birthdays.  Leslie loves to throw extravagant parties for her friends to show them how much she loves them.

We know Janet can make more ""human"" people now, and because she has got to know Chidi so well, she was able to recreate him as a way to make the experiment seem valid to The Judge i.e Chidi falling in love w Simone again &amp; teaching a new squad about Ethics. New Chidi is literally a clone. 

This way, Eleanor is tortured for the sake of the experiment and they all get into The Good Place. Or, Michael tells her about original Chidi, she finds him and they chill in the dot of the I forever.

I feel like the last few episodes of the season, he barely interacted with any of the other characters, and the only jokes involving him were about his indecision, which I felt had mostly gone away and were just throwaways. Also, why didn't we get to meet any of his friends and family? Jason was barely noticeable as well, except for the brief moments in the Book of Dougs with him, Janet, and Tahani.

The thought of this happening to Eleanor, Chidi and Simone is terrifying, especially with Simone possibly being the only human in this experiment to actually deserve being in the Good Place (until we meet the others, ye Gods.)

-
In this essay he describes four clown archetypes - Whitefaces, Augustes, Tramps and Ringmasters. Here is a truncated overview - 
Whitefaces cause trouble, it doesnt befall them. They are the wiseguy, the ringleader. 
Augustes are the ones who have pianos fall on their heads. The Auguste is the Poor Schnook.
The Tramp is the Eternal Innocent, not quite connected to reality. The Tramp is the Smiling Child.
The Ringmaster is the straight man, the Frowning Parent. 

For example: the Marx Brothers - Groucho (Whiteface), Chico (Auguste), Harpo (Tramp) and Margaret Dumont (Ringmaster)
or Seinfeld - Jerry (Ringmaster), Elaine (Whiteface), George (Auguste) and Kramer (Tramp). Come up with your own. It's fun!
----
So, here is my Good Place analysis -
Eleanor - The Whiteface full of rage.
Chidi - The Auguste or poor Shnook. Even his death is on brand.
Jason - The Tramp who is not quite connected with reality.
Tahani - The Ringmaster or Frowning Parent. Tahani often channels Margaret Dumont as a representative of high society.

I'm just making this post to commend the voice acting in other languages. I like to watch the series with some subtitles sometimes just to practice other languages and get used to the translation differences, but I've sometimes accidentally changed the audio instead of the subtitles and, honestly, I couldn't be happier with this little happy accidents! (I never change audios of the series I'm watching. It's always the original.)

Not only the translations are top-notch, the voice acting is amazing, sometimes I feel like they could be the characters's real voices. And that goes to all languages available. I'm rewatching the show with one random language at a time, with different subtitles too.

Thank you.",7,1,False,self,,,,,

## Who else is tired of this Chidi Eleanor relationship and mindwiping

It seems like every single season has gone back to one thing for the plot, they get their mind wiped and Chidi and Eleanor have to fall in love again or whatever. I just wish the writers could go a different direction then falling back into the same spot they were just in. Because of this Im not very excited for season 4 (of course Im going to watch it) because I dont want to see the same plot of the same love triangle we already saw in season 2 and season 1.",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

During my most recent rewatch I was thinking about how Janets work. In Michaels neighborhood Janet appears the instant any character calls her, whether its on purpose or on accident. But the only characters we see call Janet are the humans and Michael, we never see a demon call Good Janet. 
However, in a real neighborhood there all of the inhabitants would be humans looking for Janets help. So what happens if Janet is helping person A and person X calls for her? She cant leave person A hanging, shes be popping all over the place and never have time to help anyone. But she also cant leave person X on hold, waiting on hold would be the opposite of The Good Place. So how does Janet work? 
In S3 when they first get to the mail room Michael references how he researched the real Good Place, so I am assuming that Michaels neighborhood works similarly to a real one. 
My first theory is that Janet is omnipresent within the neighborhood shes assigned. Shes a single entity who appears in multiple places to help multiple people simultaneously. These separate Janets are not Janet babies (which I cant imagine that even the writers know where Janet babies is headed). Her onmipresentness would allow her to serve all the residents with no waits and constantly update all of the knowledge in the universe simultaneously. 
My second theory deals with our Janet specifically. Our Janet, through all the reboots and growth, has only spent time helping 4 humans and 1 reformed demon. I think this close proximity and lack of other people has allowed Janet to connect to our humans like no Janet has before. 

TL:DR - Janets serve everyone at one by being omnipresent with their neighborhoods and our Janet has been able to connect to our 4 humans by being able to focus just on them.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Would this not be the expected result from his actions?

Yes, he does good. No denying that. However, what turned his life around and inspired him to live so well was his revelation about the point system. He realized one gets points for doing good things, loses points for doing bad, and these tallies determine if one goes to the good or bad place. So that would mean that hes not being a good person to be good, but rather for the reward of the good place. Weve already seen with Tahani that good actions with less than wholesome intentions is still negative points. Would this not also be the case with Doug Forcett? To me it just seems odd that the show has overlooked this so far or am I reading too much into it?

I hope there's a reveal at some point that our afterlife is somehow whatever we make it, and that things like angels and demons don't really exist.

It just strikes me as odd that Michael Schur would ultimately spread a religious message like that.

Fuck. Fork. This is amazing. Holy shirt. Okay. Okay.

So FORKING SHAUN said it was case number three. 000000003 or whatever the fuck. Minor detail? FUCKING NO

Case number three is Eleanor and pals. They made it clear that was the first time they reached self awareness. They were not acting.

Holy fork. Okay so case number two. MINDY SINCLAIRE is case number two. They said it in the show! That they met to discuss her fate. Holy shit. SHE IS AN ALLUSION TO LILITH FROM THE BIBLE. Here me out.

Okay okay so Lilith was an independent wooooman. She didn't want to Adam to pin her down and she REFUSED HER OWN PURPOSE and became completely and utterly independent. It's reminescent of Ayn Rand's moral philosophy. BUT because wrong or right hadn't been invented yet, and SIN had not been invented yet, she couldn't have been held accountable for disobeying God. BUT she disobeyed God. TRUE FORKING NEUTRAL

CHRISTIANS WROTE HER OUT OF THE BIBLE BECAUSE SHE WAS INCONVENIENT FOR THEIR HOLY STORY JUST LIKE THE GOOD AND BAD PLACE DISOWNED MINDY AND ISOLATED HER. Lilith represents ungodliness and temptation and she tried to tempt the protagonists into staying in her neutral place. Even though she is shown as neutral in that story, she is still the villain because she manipulates people and inhibits them from realizing their hopes.

It GETS CREEPIER IN THIS ARTICLE OH MY FUCKING GOD IT EVEN TALKS ABOUT THE DESERT SHE LIVES IN JESUS CHRIST SHE IS LILITH READ THIS ARTICLS:

https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/people-in-the-bible/lilith/


SO WHAT WAS THE OTHER FUCKING CASE?

Adam and Eve. MANKIND'S ULTIMATE MORAL DILEMNA. How could Eve know it was a sin if the serpent lied and said it would help her get closer to God? How could she have known right and wrong and sin if sin had not been invented yet?

AND SO I just cracked this entire fucking show. I am Chitty and Eleanor combined. Feel my wrath. And I've only seen season one. Bow at my feet. I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA BITCHES

THE SHOW IS A COMMENTARY ON WESTERN RELIGION AND I AM A GENIUS

Also please other people with different religions experiences please share your interpretations. I'm very open minded I promise. Just excited as fork. Make me a writer of this fucking show.",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I wanted to talk about the show a bit, and I didnt really have a good place (heh) to talk about it, so I thought Id try this sub. This show has really forced me to think about whether I am as good of a person as I think I am, and also consider what I think it means to be truly good - and each character sort of plays a role in that (no big spoilers in my post, just personality discussion). 

For the most part, I see the show as juxtaposition between Chidi and Tahani, alongside juxtaposition of Eleanor and Jason. 

Chidi represents good intent, but with unintended consequences. An analogy I remember from my own philosophy classes was a guy who really wanted to be a good doctor, so he offered to do a lot of operations with the intent of saving people. But if he killed those people accidentally, having good intent isnt enough to claim he is a good doctor. By the same token, Chidi spent his whole life debating and studying what it means to be good, and arguably may be farther along than the rest, but the unintentional pain he causes others from his personality means that he isnt always creating a net gain of good. 

Tahani represents good action without good intent. The good things she wants to do are tainted by motivations of spite, self-legacy, or other insecurities. Here, the takeaway is that doing good isnt the same as being good. 

Eleanor represents willful ignorance, at least before she asks for Chidis help. Her justification for not being in The Bad Place is that she isnt as bad as the truly awful people, and therefore doesnt deserve the same scorn, ridicule, or other punishments and tortures. I feel like the takeaway here is that being good isnt a competition, and being better than others (or less bad) isnt the same as being a good person. 

Jason represents unwillful ignorance, for lack of a better way to put it. In many scenarios he is the most kind of the four; he is quick to forgive or trust, he doesnt really put others down, and doesnt have many ulterior motives. He might have been a good person had it not been his upbringing and environment. More often than other characters, the bad he does seems like he genuinely doesnt know any better. He might not know that something hurts others as much as it does, or he might not know fully the reason why one should strive to be good. Jason exists to remind the audience that ignorance isnt an excuse, despite this being one of the tougher pills to swallow when we look at ourselves and what we dont realize is hurting others (insensitive jokes, for example).

I feel like the show is trying to tell us that, regardless of whether a Bad or Good Place exists, to be good is to understand that these four types of people are very common, and can overlap. The show has made me think that if I truly want to be a good person, I need to reflect on times where I am like the main characters, why that may be, and if I can do or be better. 

Anyway, thank you for reading. Id love to hear your thoughts on the show as well!",2,19,False,self,,,,,

At the end of Season 3 of the Good Place, it was part of the plot that the improved Derek was going to assist Janet in creating a town's worth of background characters for the Good Place experiment.

Derek had also shown indications of a contentious relationship with Jason, some jealousy, and a desire to impress Janet.

I believe that he may have implanted character traits in the townspeople to either dislike Jason or infuriate him. Whether it might be everyone in town hating the Jaguars or just simply hating Jason, I believe Derek will turn the people against his rival for Janet's affection. 

Derek's eagerness to help and Jason's uneasiness with him assisting is potential foreshadowing for an inexplicable ""Jason was right"" scenario.

In the new simulation, Chidi is the lynchpin. Without him, the humans will be unable to become better versions of themselves. But even then, Chidi struggles with making ethical decisions, which in turn causes people misery. Maybe God felt that way, that he was sitting up there, unable to make decisions that would affect humans (because he can't). Maybe he created Chidi-Essence on Earth, but then realised that Chidi-Essence was debilitated by the number of possibilities and consequences of his actions, most significantly death. Thus, he thought that maybe Chidi-Essence could help people in the Bad Place (the afterlife) become better. 

The one thing that stays constant in Michael's version of the Bad Place is that Chidi helps Eleanor. He can teach morals and ethics (or his disciples on Earth do), but his Essence-hands remained tied even on Earth. Maybe by placing his Essence in Michael's simulation, he's able to directly help humans in an easier way because the possibility of his actions leading to their deaths is no longer a concern. Chidi-Essence is now able to put to use some of the ethical and moral actions that he normally would be unable to engage in with those on Earth.

Chidi-Essence does not retain God's memories or powers, and is thus able to have his brain reset just like the rest of them. Him falling for Eleanor is, in a sense, real.

Most of what is written here is not new information but I have attempted to write all the facts we know about this show and some theories &amp; questions came up.

&gt;!**Theory**

**The rules of the universe have changed and now there are multiple Gods. These beings will be tasked with creating new versions of the Earth/world/universe since God's point system doesn't work.

Derek and the Janet Babies are the new Gods. The show will end with an Earth created by literal committee with an upgraded point system.

The committee will comprise of Janets/Janet babies (as 188 architects), the 4 humans, the judge, Michael and Sean (who will debate on the new point system)

The 4 humans can't go to BP, GP or MP and will essentially become the perfect architects due to their understanding of flaws.**

**Canon**

1. Good, Bad, Medium place and the neutral zone are real therefore God and Satan exist. Though conspicuously absent, God created the universe + humans + real good place. Probably all Janets too as there exists three types of her/it.

2. The only other beings not alive are in the universe are: a) The Judge.  b) The Demons/BP employees.  c)The Angels/GP employees.  d).Janets (killable)     e). Derek/Janet Babies(killable*). f). Humans in the afterlife.  g). Michael suit (new BP creation). h) Neutral Zone employees

3. Michael is the only demon architect and the neighbourhood project is the first of it's kind. His powers only work in BP and the Neighbourhood. He is a lower level employee in BP (lower than Sean)

4. The Judge is the 2nd most powerful being in the universe. Her powers dont work in IHOP only. She can travel through time. Her word is final. On s3 e12 she gave orders Sean &amp; Michael around and grants Janet the ability to use her powers in MP.

4. Michael's Janet was from GP and her power is limited to the neighbourhood, GP and the void. Her powers weaken or disappear on Earth and medium place (MP) In the Janet's episode it is shown that she is not perfect at creation.

5. Derek is a new type of being (janet baby) that might be more powerful than Janet. 

On s3e12 he reveals he has been rebooted more than Janet at around 500 ,000 reboots and already had powers in  MP, which Janet didn't have. 

6. The new Janet Babies (186 total) of the new neighbourhood as per s3 e 13, will be created better than Derek (more human like)

7. Janets are not omnipresent. She/It has a birth day. She does tasks in fractions of a second in chronological order and can get tired from creating (New and old neighbourhood).But she can freeze time and exist in no time and nowhere.(void)

8. Nobody has been to GP in ~500 years.

9. Eleanor is currently an architect with powers only in the new neighbourhood in MP

10. Other realities/timelines exist as seen by Chidi in the Time Knife outside of BP, GP and MP. 10 dimensions exist in the universe.

11. Chidi, Eleanor, Jason and Tahani are no longer human. In the Janets episode, actual Janet states that they are the first humans to die without automatically going to GP, BP, NZ and MP despite visiting all 4. They are interdimensional beings awaiting punishment. Their powers work only in Janet's void (excepting Eleanor) 

12. Murder is at least -1,000,000 points.

13. Technology can improve beyond creation. I.e. new inventions Michael suit, device that sees timelines, portals to earth.

14. Demons had never been to earth until they built a 2nd door except Michael.

15. Sean is against revising the point system because the Bad Place will lose humans to torture


**Questions**

1. Where is God?

2. What is the difference between God and Janet/Derek? 

3. Does God know about humans in the afterlife? (records stop at death) 

4. Do GP angels know about their stolen Janet?

5. Where do Janet Babies go if they die?

6. Where is Satan?

7. How human is Janet?!&lt;",2,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am mad at myself for not listening to it sooner! It's just as delightful as the show and provides great insight into how the show is made. But the main reason I love it? Marc Evan Jackson. He is a wonderful host who always gives all his guests time to talk and never interrupts them. I've only ever seen him as Shawn and Kevin. So I'm used to seeing him as the comically stoic type of guy. Why did nobody tell me he was so sweet and adorable?! I also love how big a fan he is of the show he is.

1. The Good Place has accountants that assigns points based on actions taken while alive.  You gain points for positive actions and negative points for negative actions.  Your total points decide. 
2. The points gained and earned do not make sense.  Points are lost for being from Florida or being french. 
3. Chidi is going to be tasked with teaching ethics in the experiments. This is due to Chidi studying philosophy, morality and ethics his entire life.   

Here is my problem!

1. Teaching Human ethics and morality should not matter. They are pointless concepts. It would be like having a 17th century scientist teaching science to students to get ready for a current day physics test. Only a fraction of concepts would be useful. 
2. Chidi should abandon the human derived morals and ethics system and make one based on the rules of The Good Place. There are the only ones that matter.  Given how wacky the rules are this is the best course of action. Chidi should basically teach to the  test.  The rules do not make sense. They dock points for the things beyond your control , beyond your knowledge or beyond your ability to comprehend. Chidi should sit down with Janet and do some hard work with the rules. 
3. The show states that no one has made it to the good place is ~500 years. What about children, infants or premature infant deaths?
.


CRAZY Theory!!! 

I think Chidi pulled a Dr. Strange when he fell through the floor in the IHOP episode. I think he saw all possible futures and found a way to make this work! I also think we may see two Chidi's in the future where one is the current Chidi and one is IHOP Chidi.  That is why he had his memory erased. He did not want to tell Elanor the future events or ruin the only way to make the experiment work!",9,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

What physicists suggest is that there is an equivalent ""anti-matter"" Universe to ours, that spurted out on the ""other side"" to our Universe.

The laws in this ""anti-matter"" Universe are similar to ours. The key difference (or complement) is the nature of time: the time in that Universe flows *opposite* to ours. It has to, considering the laws of Physics for anti-matter are simply time-reversed version of ""regular"" matter.

Now from the show, we know they have easy access to anti-matter coffee. It seems to be a hit among the demons and guardians of Earth alike.

So ""Jeremy Bearimy"" is simply tunnels between the two Universes. Time can flow backwards and forwards, because Demons and these higher dimensional beings have access to tunnels going between the two universes. While we cannot comprehend the ""other side"", they can, through the vantage point of higher dimensions.

That only leaves the matter of the dot above the i in Jeremy Bearimy. That seems to be a closed loop between only two polar opposite points in the two Universes. Completed isolated from rest of the convoluted time curve.

It would be kind of cool if Michael Schur knew about this research and decided to include it as a plot for the show.",3,23,False,spoiler,,,,,

Evidence for this abounds: the point system giving equal weight to actions at any point in one's life, the concept of Neighbourhood 12358W, even just the idea putting all the emphasis on a century or so of someone's existence when determining how they'll spend eternity. This is, obviously to anyone who lives around humans, completely false -- but the Afterlife existed for billions of years before humans started going there, and much of its infrastructure was in place from the start (Judge Gen, S02E11:""[Hydrogen] was the only thing that was in existence at the time that I was born"", and there's not much use for a judge without separate Places to mediate).

I propose that, when humans started showing up in the Afterlife (maybe because their souls had become complicated enough to resemble those of Eternals?), there was no protocol for dealing with them. Of course, the Good Place wanted to care for them and make them happy, whereas the Bad Place wanted to torture them and make them miserable. This, presumably, was Case #00001, in which the Judge ruled that a team of architects from both Places would design a system to judge humans during their lives and determine who would get to keep them once they entered the Afterlife. Presumably the Bad half of this team rigged the system to get the vast majority of humans, but even so, neither the angels nor the demons really understood humans -- they were new, after all, and even during the events of the show most Eternals only have a superficial understanding of human life. Thus, to determine how their actions corresponded to their true nature, they looked at beings they understood: themselves. Therefore, we can assume that the fundamental assumption of the Afterlife is based on an observation: that Eternals don't have the capacity to change their nature.

Now you may be thinking, ""Well, duh. They've been around for billions of years, they'll be set in their ways."" However, they designed the Point System *knowing* that humans are only around for a century or so before they get to the Afterlife, and we know they were either angels or demons from the outset, so it must be a fundamental difference between Eternals and humans. This is important, because it means that not only is Michael's arc unprecedented in the Afterlife, it's not actually possible. I propose: it's not happening, at least not like we think. This has actually been Michael's true nature the whole time, he's just never realised because he's lived his whole life in a world of pure evil, with no real concept of someone like him. He learned how to act like a demon to fit in, but never really clicked with it, because he literally could not.

There's evidence for this: it's well known that, even before meeting Team Cockroach, he was genuinely fascinated by humans and designed Neighbourhood 12358W to actually interact with them and not just to torture them, even if he also wanted to do that. And even in his torture methods he's much more empathetic than any other demon -- the others just want to cause pain for its own sake, whereas he wants to really understand the person and deliver a misery that's tailored exactly to them. Plus, the accountants, who have presumably seen both an angel's and a demon's aura and should be able to distinguish between them, believe him when he says he's a Good Place architect.

But perhaps the biggest clue is, as previously mentioned, his arc in the latter half of S2 and into S3. Once he's good, he has none of his former demonic traits, even going so far as to be more ashamed than proud of his labour of hate, Neighbourhood 12358W (S03E07: ""I didn't want you to see how cruel I used to be."") It should be noted, it wasn't just 300 years of reboots that did this, as a. the 318 ""residents"" lived through the same 300 years, and interacted just as closely with the humans, but they all stayed evil; and b. Michael was actually still evil after that time (S02E05, take your pick) -- it was interacting with the humans *without a specific plan* that eventually made him realise which way of thinking was more natural to him.

So yes, I am essentially saying that Michael is Eleanor in S1, but for real. (Maybe there's a demon Michael in the Good Place who made Neighbourhood 85321M, for people who would get bored in the traditional utopia?) Honestly, with everything above, and the crazy shirt this show has pulled off in the past, I'm half-expecting this to actually be the plan.",15,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

(Possibly Janet neither) Or she somehow did something after her death that allowed her to be there, in opposition to her single good act balancing everything.
I mean- unlike the good place (real one), the medium place can be accessed by the bad place train. There's no Janet for there (well..  Derek is, now, and he seems up to no good to me), no portal in the Judge office for there either. And you can access it fairly easily. Plus, Shawn had no problem going there, and it's not so much in terms of rules it's troubling- but with how troublesome it seems to be to actually travel from a realm to another.

It's... just an idea, a sketch, for now, though. Maybe there's something I completely forgot or misunderstood. What do you think?",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

*Actually, I think the biggest clue that Michael is an Angel is Jason.

Jason is known for foreshadowing events throughout the series. In S1E11 when he and Janet are in Michael's office, he calls Michael an Angel.

Honestly, that's proof enough for me. At first, it was a throwaway, funny comment. Now, knowing how Schur builds his show and how Jason is somewhat clairvoyant, Michael being an Angel is incredibly possible.*",10,18,False,spoiler,,,,,
