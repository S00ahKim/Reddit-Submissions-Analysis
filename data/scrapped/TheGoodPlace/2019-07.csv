I'm so new to posting on Reddit so I have no clue if I'm doing everything right, so apologies in advance!

I'm an avid musical theater composer with a few major works under my belt and in development (including one featured by Jenna Marbles), and for the longest time I've wanted to develop The Good Place into a musical.

So, I did just that!
This isn't a full-fledged musical with a script and everything. I suppose it's more just ""fan-made songs,"" but I like to write in a musical theater and dramatic style. I'm taking some of my favorite moments from the show and turning them into full-length songs. Then, I'm also doing character solos for everyone that sort of introduces them to the world. I'm writing these as I'd see them play out if the events of the show took place in a musical!

Here is my first song in this ""series!""
(idk if this is a spoiler so just in case this is a Season One spoiler)

It's called ""How To Be Good"" and is the classic ""I Want"" song in a musical. It details the moment Eleanor asks Chidi to teach her ethics to become a good person!

I have many more songs written and ready to record, so I'll post those too as I make them. I just wanted to share it with you all because I figured you'd like it!

Also, I low-key wrote this in Kristen Bell's range, just saying :O

Hope you all enjoy it!

I'm not a spiritualist, but actually someone who has studied science for most of his life.  I always thought there would be a theory of everything and recently (last year or so) realise that these questions are basically unanswerable.    Enough about me, though.  The Good Place started off as almost a cliche of heaven and I was actually taken by surprise that the whole ""this is not the good place, it's the bad place, we've  been trying to torture you this entire time"".   I started getting suspicious around the time Tahani looked up the list of people in the park.  Anyways,  I still don't understand some of the basics of the show's universe - not sure what Michael's true intentions are.  How are memories being created, what is a soul, what created this etc.... 

My theory is that Michael is a spirit that is just continuing the human experience for the main characters.  He doesn't work for the good place or the bad place, but is merely a guide 'god' persay.  He wants to see the characters of the show improve, and giving them an experience to help them be a better them, all the while they figure out the real point of existence.  There is no heaven and there is no hell, our perspective in the universe is all that matters.   I'd like to note here that the show will never be able to end on the perfect note, it's just that good.  

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more I could get into, but the important part is that I think the show allows for my imagination to go wild.  I can theorize about the big picture we actually live in and how I could never really test them.  It lets me explore my own spirituality while giving an exciting story.",0,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've only seen the 3rd season once, so excuse me if I've missed something important!

&amp;#x200B;

So, as I understand it, at the end of Season 3 they are starting a new fake good place in order to determine and prove to the judge that humans can change and grow in the afterlife. They need to prove that A: any random humans can do it and B: They can do it without the motivation of wanting to get into heaven. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, it's not like the demons will only send people to the fake good place who would have gotten into heaven 500 years ago, before the system supposedly broke. They are sending scum-bags that would have gone to hell at any point in time. 

I think, if our gang reaches their goal, they are going to prove that almost *no one* deserves to be in hell for eternity, and that anyone (or at least a lot of people) can change for the better.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say they prove their point, and 'win'. It's seen that the majority of people in hell could be good if given the chance.

Will they expect the judge to provide fake good places for everyone? How much micromanagement is required to ensure that everyone is getting the right kind of torture/help they need to improve? Will people in heaven at the moment be recruited to help? Will demons be recruited to help? Because we've got proof they can change as well, with Michael. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will they make massive fake good places to accommodate everyone? Earth was supposed to be the filter that determined where humans go in their afterlife, so will it be destroyed as flawed? 

I can imagine a scenario where fake good places become so big and so complex that they are basically Earth 2.0. Maybe Janet becomes the focus of a new religion. Maybe the complexity becomes so much that humans get hemmed into the 'no good choices' scenario again. Maybe that's what happened with Earth 1.0 in the first place? 

Or maybe they will give reincarnation a shot.

However, we had little information on the actual good place or its guardians until **The Book of Dougs** (S3E11).

The representatives of the good place are slow and over-deliberative regarding the fundamental flaw with the points system, in that every action has negative roots in an interconnected world.

However, I believe that they're perfectly content with the current system, as it *stops more people from ever entering the good place,* even if that person deserves a place based on the intention of their actions.

Now, why would that be? If Michael based his experimental ""Good Place"" in S1 on an *actual* part of the Good Place, then heaven is set for instant failure.

We human beings are not designed to coexist in perfect harmony with each other for an eternity, no matter how pleasant our neighbours or surroundings could ever be. We fight, we argue and fork around in other people's business. And this would apply just as much to the people who have earned the good life from their deeds on earth as it does to shirtheads like Eleanor.

In fact, those who earned a spot in the good place have it even worse: they won the game of life. They got an eternal spot in heaven, so why the hell should they keep acting good? Nothing can stop them from being selfish bullies, so why not be one?

Given all that, the guardians of the Good Place are happy to let the system prevent any more people in, while they try to fix this mess. But how can they possibly fix this? They can't possibly bring this embarrassment of an outcome to the judge, in front of all the meanies from the bad place? Besides, the Bad Place are delighted with this outcome, too! They get to punish every single person in the world for all eternity once they die.

The answer to this lies with the soul squad, specifically Michael. He understands more than any other immortal being what it means to be human. The value of love, compassion and what we owe to each other. He'll be the architect that allows the Good Place to live up to its name.

**TL;DR: The ""Good Place"" turns good people bad because it's eternal and doesn't encourage good behaviour. Therefore, the guardians of the good place are happy to stop allowing anyone into the good place**",5,12,False,self,,,,,

This theory explains that Tahani doesn't necessarily ""choose"" to have the accent we hear in season 1, as Eleanor theorizes. This theory assumes that, besides the torture aspects, Michael's original neighborhood operates under similar rules to the real Good Place; especially the highly analyzed language rule. Like almost half the theories on this sub, this theory hinges on Chidi's explanation that The Good Place translates the speaker's words into a language the listener can understand. When Chidi speaks French Eleanor hears English. My theory is that the English Eleanor hears is being *projected* onto Chidi's words, like it is being heard through a filter. 

Later in season 1 Eleanor complains that no one else has an accent but Tahani ""chooses"" to have hers. But I believe Eleanor is *projecting* that accent onto Tahani. If French-&gt;English has to go through the filter then English-&gt;English also goes through the filter and wouldn't generally change. But, because of how many preconceived notions Eleanor has about Tahani she *projects* the accent onto Tahani's words, just like she *projects* English onto Chidi's words. 

Now, hopefully you were able to follow that because here is the Good Place level twist. Tahani was choosing to have that accent. Eleanor's projection was just correct. In season 2 on Earth we see that Tahani has the same accent on Earth as in The Good Place, so it is her real accent. On ""The Good Place The Podcast"" the writers often talk about Eleanor's ""antennae"", her ability to know when she's being screwed with. Part of that is her ability to read people. When she judged Tahani by her cover Eleanor guessed the whole damn book correctly, including Tahni's accent.  Most of Tahani's flaws that Eleanor saw ended up being very real things that Tahani has to work to improve. This deep understanding that Eleanor has of Tahani is a major catalyst for their now deep friendship when coupled with Eleanor's improvement on emotionally opening up to the rest of the squad. 

This theory can then also be applied to Chidi's English. In season 2 we see that he does speak French, he just also speaks English with a damn good American accent. Yet again, Eleanor guessed Chidi's accent right further proving her deep connection to him. It could even be applied to Jason's accent, he sounds like a failed DJ from Jacksonville! But I think most of us would get that one right.    

TLDR: Eleanor is so good at judging people that she correctly guessed Tahani's accent.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

This is a pretty common character trope, and just like characters like Kevin from the office, people theorise that he's a lot smarter than he lets on.
If you were going to design a place to torture people, how would you do it? By making them think they are in heaven? People are pretty untrusting and would eventually figure it out. The best way would be to convince them they were in the bad place but escaped. 

Even after Micheal, who tortured them, joins their side each charecter is still sad. This includes Micheal and Jannete, who shouldn't even be capable of being sad. I think that each charecter, except for Jason died on Earth, and has been convinced of their role in the after life. The real way to make humans torture each other is to make them think they aren't human.

And it started off great, the first episode I was hooked. It was a really cool concept for a series that isn't over saturated and Kristen Bell is always amazing, so my expectations were high. But then, the twist came..

Eleanor stated that she didn't belong in the good place. And at first I was like, hmm that's an interesting twist, let's see where this goes. But then as the series goes on we find out more and more about Eleanor when she was alive and all the things she did, and I started to hate her as a character.

It wasn't even so much that she did bad stuff, cuz we're all guilty of doing bad stuff. But the fact that when confronted she refuses to take responsibility, she's only looking out for herself, even at the expense of other people's misery, and just quite frankly being a stuck up bitch. And that carried over into the afterlife..

She takes advantage of Chidi, is always finding ways to weasle out of problems, and has no intention of taking responsibility for the shit she's causing in the good place. Even the times when she does show signs of being a good person, comes off as fake as deep down I know she's just tryna cover her ass to not get kicked out of the good place.

Keep in mind I'm only on S1 E7, but I've struggled to continue watching tbh. Every couple minutes of watching I pause and force myself not to punch the screen. I just can't get behind and support a character that is very clearly morally wrong. And the same goes for Jason.

I'm pretty sure things get better and they do change as the series goes on, and if so don't spoil it for me please. But 7 episodes in, I've found out that I'd rather support a villain that can morally justify their own reasons (like Thanos in Avengers, or Pain in Naruto), than support a main character that is just an asshole and only justifies their actions by saying ""well I don't wanna take responsibility"".",10,3,False,self,,,,,

But he doesnt belong there: he did all of these good things SO that he would go The Good Place. Surely that means he cannot get to The Good Place because he knows about it so his motivations are corrupt, just like how Eleanor couldnt increase her points total in S1 and how the experiment on Earth by Michael had to be abandoned once the group found out about the afterlife.

Question: why does Eleanor act differently in her return to the real world?

Potential answer: so many reboots, like Janet! She was in the same loop over and over. Some took less time or more time, but it built her to become more moral.

This isnt exactly from the show, but I found comparing people to Janet's reboots an interesting thought experiment. Janet doesnt retain memories either, but she retains her intuition.

I found this to be a great example of how our subconscious is formed from seemingly arbitrary moments in our lives, yet those arvitrary moments spoonfed our decision making process.

(because, not to wax my own car, but I have a pretty good track record of my fan theories about other shows being right....) 

&amp;#x200B;

The thesis of the show right now is that the entire system of judging people on Earth to determine placement in the afterlife is bogus, because humans are capable of improving, and becoming good, Good-Place-worthy people after death. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem: This is apparently a revolutionary concept to the Immortal Beings who are supposed to be running the universe. Certainly Michael was not at the top of things, and we can assume Shawn isn't either -- but the all-knowing Judge Gen? If Gen knows the highest moral standard in existence, and is using it, and the existing system is unjust, then there's no reason for Season 4. 

&amp;#x200B;

(This is why everyone hates metaphysical philosophers, too.)

&amp;#x200B;

My theory: 

&amp;#x200B;

Shawn and Michael are being judged. All Immortal Beings at Bad Place HQ are being judged on an ongoing basis by the ultimate judges, by putting them in a situation where they can run the ""afterlife"" however they want. But they are failing to advance to the Good Place by continuing to be evil bastards -- except, perhaps, Michael. This is one of the \*true\* purposes of the Afterlife.

&amp;#x200B;

As for who the ultimate judges are, it may be Gen who has been playing dumb this whole time, but I think the ultimate judges are a race of beings we haven't met yet, except for their larval forms, whom we know as the Janets.",5,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I already had a plan and was very close to actioning it several times.

But I told myself that I needed to watch the last season of Game of Thrones (which was a bummer) and the next season of The Good Place (I didnt know that it would be the last season back then) and I just wanted/needed to know how it continued and shoved the negative thoughts aside, thinking that I only needed to resist those thoughts until september and then Ill see what happens, what Ill feel, see if something has changed.

In the meanwhile I got so very desperate and realized that I was in a seriously bad place (no pun intended), that I am now on antidepressants and will be starting therapy again soon and now know that if its not this TV show then Ill find something else that keeps me alive and give me a positive outlook, because I guess life throws shit at us but also those good moments happen and there are good people in my life that make it worth it.

I like where the show is heading in a direction showing that the point system is not fair and inaccurate. However, I believe it goes beyond that.

Season 4 will be the start of them actually being in the Good Place. They will be able to enjoy things and live happily ever after **_forever_**... Is that it, is all of their progress just them going to a place that is better for all of eternity? Is eternity even an actual realistic thing? If you remain 'human' in eternity, you will eventually do everything you can think of and still have an endless amount of time.

No, I think in Season 4, Eleanor and Chidi (and maybe Tahani and Jason(?)) will realize that while the Good Place is amazing, they have ultimately changed as people and want to continue helping others on Earth guiding them and encouraging them. Eleanor will be helpful and kind, Chidi will be more decisive in teaching ethics, Tahani will actually run charities for the purpose of saving other people, and Jason... well I guess he will be providing a life for the sentient Janet that loves him(?).

What's never addressed is why there is one? What do these ""angels"" and ""demons"" get from maintaining and judging every single human to ever exist? If it were to encourage good behavior wouldn't they 1) make sure every human knows about it and 2) not care what your motivations are since, without careful, direct interference, they are rarely in our control?

And also, side note. Why is it that the cream of the crop are the only ones who go to the good place? People who get a positive point value but aren't the highest get to be tortured for eternity? There doesn't seem to be any end goal or overarching motivation for this afterlife that is usually around in other afterlives.

And maybe that's true. I can't disprove it, although I honestly doubt it because this show is unusually focused on attention to detail in worldbuilding and often reminds me of Community, also a process-heavy NBC comedy dealing with shifting allegiances that bring deep moral implications.

(Refers to this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/c8a0d1/doug_forcett_should_not_have_so_many_points/esly2no/)

I, too, wondered how Michael could conclude that Doug is as close to good as possible, given that he admitted to acting out of fear of torture. However, there's a very subtle distinction here that many redditors are missing. Doug guessed that the afterlife probably works a certain way, and felt very strong about it, so he restructured his life to reduce his negative impact on others. When Michael asks him to consider that he has already secured moral dessert, his response does refer to the possibility of eternal torment, yes. But it's not like he's chosen to do these things purely out of fear. He just doesn't think ""maybe it's time to chill out"" is a compelling argument when the stakes are eternal damnation. And he has a point!

He has no reason to doubt Michael; of all the journalists in Alberta, this one is most interested in Doug's point system, and it has to cross his mind that it's possible he is only there to test him. But however you worded Michael's suggestion, it is doubtlessly one he heard many times: ""Why don't you just chill, man?"" ""Why are you like this all the time?"" ""What's the worst that could happen?"" ""Just turn off the good-guy act for a minute and answer the question."" Etc.

His response to all of that is probably fairly consistent: I don't judge you for living your way, but I have to live my way because it seems best for everyone. He refers to losing just enough points to slip into the Bad Place only because that was the explicit theme of Michael's suggestion: Don't you think you've racked up enough points? It is perfectly sensible to reply: Actually, for all you know, my moral compass will slip to the point where I hurt people just to make my life on Earth less torturous, and then I'll earn the Bad Place. It is reasonable for the viewer to conclude that Doug puts this in terms of the immortal soul of Doug only because he thinks of Michael as a thoughtful and worldly man who has a real concern about Doug's life, but as an Alberta journalist, probably not morally pure. (For those who don't know, Alberta is kind of like the Arizona of Canada. Explicitly racist blackface was THE form of entertainment there until pretty recently, and the province actually eliminated rats, basically the opposite of Doug's relationship to small gross animals.)

One phrase that popped into a lot of western US/Canada viewers' heads (and urban US/Canada in general) when watching Doug drink and offer filtered piss as drinking water had to be 'lifestyle anarchism'. TGP can't actually say the word anarchism or get into sectarian left-wing debates because the point of the show is to examine good and bad from a lofty place where they can appeal to universal or culturally shared values without being politically alienating. But that's the sectarian term for people who use composting toilets on the left. In that way, the r/tgp debate about Doug's motives is essentially parallel to the real life left-wing debate about whether modeling a thoughtful and egalitarian way of life is actually helping people or just an exercise in moral masturbation for anarchists.

If Doug were really a moral masturbator or seeking moral dessert, it would be incredibly tempting for him to try to fix the sociopath kid in his neighborhood. Boys of his age are tough to work with, but ultimately still malleable minds that have not necessarily formed permanent habits of thinking. If you think of yourself as a good person doing maximum good for the world, you could easily fall into a narcissistic fantasy of fixing teen boys with your magic good-intentions. Even the cynics on Criminal Minds would admit that a teenage sociopath makes choices in life and could theoretically become good. Remember, this man has a COMPOSTING TOILET. He has a very high threshold for discomfort and irritation, certainly comparable to a local gym teacher or child psychologist. What could more surely save your soul than saving someone else's soul?

Yet he shows absolutely no interest, even though most men in his position would intervene just out of worldly fear (the kid will hurt them, smash up their garden, torture someone's cat, etc). Doug doesn't even take the risk of getting involved. You could argue that makes him medium, but I think it's more that he sees the low-grade sociopathy as mostly harmless in and of itself. He reasons that if he plays along, the kid will be content with that level of mayhem and won't escalate to torturing animals or attacking people. If that is the logic, it seems to be working. After all, the kid could do just about anything to Doug or his radishes; and he knows Doug would just smile, shrug and work on getting back to normal. But all he wants is a quick laugh and a feeling of omnipotence. He doesn't want to wallow in the misery like a demon.

Which brings me to my larger point. It's not just that modern life is so complicated that it's impossible to earn enough points for the good place anymore. That's an issue, but the squad's real problem is that there is a system for automatically sending people to the Good Place if their points are in green and a system for automatically sending them to the Bad Place if their points are in red, but no one wants to do the hard work of deciding how much green or red is actually just medium and it may be impossible. Honestly, I think the Judge is complicit. Remember, she originally agrees to Tahani's appeal on the basis that ""I'm stupid bored"". If the Medium Place had a claim over some mass of humanity like the Good and Bad Places do, there would almost never be a reason to call the Judge about anything and she'd sit in her chambers forever waiting for the next NCIS spinoff.

I don't think that's a conscious choice she made- after all, she purposely chose to know as little about humanity as possible until they forced her hand. She is genuinely concerned to learn about the treatment of Black women on Earth, so she probably wouldn't choose to send every single one of them to the Bad Place for 500 years just to feel needed. No, I think the writers chose 500 years as the interval for a very good reason and haven't made Michael and Gen aware of it yet.

I think this show is about how deep the decolonization struggle goes into the heart of man and everything we've learned just to get by in our world. 500 years ago is when Columbus raped and enslaved his way across the Atlantic, and I think that's why they had Janet pause the conversation between Michael and Chidi when the latter mentions Columbus, giving that lengthy summary of stuff any Senegalese-Australian ethics professor surely knew about European explorers already. In other words, it's foreshadowing, and goes with Chidi's response to Tahani about France: ""They enslaved my country for hundreds of years"". This could not have and did not shock Tahani, who is familiar with colonialism through her own family- who also drilled her on French military history. So I think that was for the audience too.

Which brings us back to the anarchist tension (or whatever you call it when you're immortal and formed your morality before the rise of the State). What the squad is working against is not just some demonic plot or judicial oversight, it's the fact that systemic rape and genocide were compatible with the moral system that got people into the Good Place for millennia before colonialism, then took over that system entirely and locked all of humanity out of the Good Place. Warped values became baked into the fundamental structure of our cultures and minds, much like today's anarchist critiques of the State. In other words, the squad is deeply in conflict with the order of the world in general, and this conflict can only end in the destruction of either their souls or the world order. The Good Place of the last 500 years is basically a legacy Medium Place that obsolete souls experience together as a group. If simply being born into this world order brings all kinds of evil, good doesn't really exist anymore and the struggle is between medium ('I hate the impact of showering/caffeine/blueberries, but I avoid offending and distracting my moral philosophy students') and bad. That's the real problem with calculating Doug's score: everything he does exists in the context of sharing a wicked world with amoral people, who he has no power over, probably because seeking power over them would automatically make him bad.

TLDR: Doug is an anarchist who has lost all hope of fixing society; Michael is so lost in abstraction that he doesn't see the most obvious thing about the 500 year period (yet); the Judge basically has no concept of [de]colonialism; Chidi's grandparents are in the Bad Place despite upturning a colonial regime, because as humans of the colonial era they had no concept of good; and the whole thing is an accidental coup for a Bad Place that has been so focused on torment they didn't even notice that they won the struggle for Earth (probably where TGP makes the cleanest break from Christianity). Chidi and Tahani should have been sent to the Medium Place immediately upon death, but that system doesn't exist. Jason and Eleanor are piggybacking: they learned to do bad stuff to survive a bad world that didn't give them legitimate opportunities (I think that's the significance of Florida and Arizona) but are willing and able to become moral when they understand it's a real thing that matters. The Judge is stalling out of a combination of politics and blissful ignorance.

Side note: Lincoln murdered 38 Dakota men and another random Native in an act of genocide, and it was actually a compromise to pacify his opponents in a country where politics was still debated exclusively among land-owning white men. On first watch it drove me nuts that Michael didn't get that, but now I think Lincoln was sent to the Medium Place by the Judge and Michael just doesn't know much about it- like how he wasn't an expert on Mindy, or he would have prevented the humans from escaping to her house 15 times. Maybe he inferred from the absence of exactly one president that there was exactly one good president, and then he didn't actually go and bother Shawn about it because he didn't want to risk cocooning.

TLDR^2: It's not just that the points system is broken. Humanity broke it by establishing the system of colonialism leading to the transatlantic slave trade. Like how Michael was always stumped that Eleanor and Chidi inevitably linked up and resisted his torture, this move by humanity is incomprehensible to immortals. I think the point is that we humans are the 'blue and orange morality' species (https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality), and any decent or even morally consistent alien would find our ways utterly bizarre and nonsensical. 

TLDR^3: The main conflict in TGP is whether the world itself is beyond redemption. Their actual souls are just details.",19,9,False,self,,,,,
