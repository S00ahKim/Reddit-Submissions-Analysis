So while I'm not ruling out that Jason/Jianyu Li could have somehow been a similar mix-up (perhaps it'll even be revealed that they died in the same accident in Phoenix as the Eleanors), it seems unlikely and there may well be other factors at work here besides innocent mixups.  Here are my hypotheses:

* Jason Mendosa, while clearly an idiot who made poor life choices, didn't seem like a bad person in the same way as bad Eleanor.  So I'm not convinced that we'll discover Jianyu Li to be in the bad place.
* The Good Place/Bad Place paradigm seems to be somewhat flawed and skewed to a degree of moral elitism.  And Michael seems to be a cog in a much larger, semi-hierarchal system.  So I'm inclined to believe that we'll come to find that someone at another level has been steering these ""mistakes"" in order to buck the status quo, making bad Eleanor (and Jason) guinea pigs in a grander experiment.
* I suspect that there will be other ""misfits"" yet to be revealed within the neighborhood.

I also have some hopes for the direction of the show:

* I hope that despite good Eleanor now being in the Good Place, I liked the inkling of Chidi and Tahani becoming closer.  So while I don't typically ""ship"" these shows, I'm inclined to ship those two.
* I hope that what was started with Chidi working with bad Eleanor and Jason will grow into a new paradigm in this neighborhood and will be embraced by others as a worthy pursuit to reform more souls.
