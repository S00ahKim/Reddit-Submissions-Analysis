We already know that they will probably team up with Mike. 

My guess:

1. The four main characters have meetings with Mike secretly about how to fool the demon crew together and they write their own torture plot. They have fun with it (it is going to be hilarious), but their feelings get hurt sometimes like Eleanor and Childi would probably pretend to fight each other and say mean things. 

2. Shawn comes to this neighborhood to see whether Mike's plan is working out as promised. The four will pull this off, but some crew demons might find out that they are acting (Vicki, some other people). They might have to kidnap him/her to prevent whistleblowing. The crew would start to become suspicious of them. It gets harder and harder to cover up. 

3. We will probably see some previous reboot flash-back. Some of them will be hilarious, and some will be super touching (like how Eleanor and Chidi end up falling in love with each other time and time again). You caught me. Yes, I ship the two. Big Time. 

4. In the process of working with Micheal, they find out more about the real rules of the good and bad place and probably figure out a way out of this nightmare situation (stuck in the bad place colluding with Mike to avoid memory erasing).

5. Eleanor finds some weakness of Shawn and uses that to blackmail/negotiate with him. She will probably offer to sacrifice herself to save the other three (like the end of season 1). The three go to the medium place with memory wiped. Mike keeps his job. Eleanor stays in the bad place experiment with the memory of what happened.

7,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2017-10-1,2017,10,1,16,73kgwl,self.TheGoodPlace,The show's rules of the afterlife are (almost) the best,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/73kgwl/the_shows_rules_of_the_afterlife_are_almost_the/,kamilgregor,1506844649,"Imagine that the rules of the afterlife described in the first episode of the Good Place are a doctrine of a religion that actually exists. I argue that a very similar model would be the most effective system for discouraging people from committing immoral actions. Why?

Lets compare some models of the afterlife to see how the Good Place model is more effective than the alternatives. I assume that the following is true for every model:

- Theres a predefined set of moral and immoral actions that everybody is judged on after they die. Their actions determine whether they end up in a Good or a Bad place.
- The afterlife last forever, i.e. its not the case that people live in the afterlife for a limited amount of time and then cease to exist.
- Only actions are important, not their motivations  this assumption is in place to keep it simple.
- How the afterlife works is known to people during their life.

Lets go through the models of the afterlife to see what their problems are:

*Model 1: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place forever and are not offset by moral actions*

In this model, theres a fixed threshold of immoral actions and if you exceed it, you go to the Bad Place forever. It doesnt matter how many moral actions you committed. If you dont exceed the threshold, you go to the Good Place.

The problem with this model is that the person who already exceeded the threshold is free to be as immoral as they want because theres nothing they can do avoid going to the Bad Place.

*Model 2: Duration of your stay in the Bad Place is limited*

This is similar to the idea of the Purgatory  grave sinners go to Hell but most medium people spend some time being punished for their limited amount of sins in the Purgatory and then get to spend the rest of eternity in the Good Place.

The problem with temporarily limited punishment is obvious: Even if the punishment lasts extremely long time from our mortal perspective (e.g. youre punished for 10 billion years), its nothing compared to infinite amount of time you get to spend in the Good Place afterwards.

So this model doesnt really discourage immoral actions at all  many people would probably conclude that its worth it to act immorally, suffer for a limited amount of time and then enjoy infinite amount of time in the Good Place.

*Model 3: Immoral people stay in the Bad Place forever but severity of their suffering is proportional to their immoral actions*

This is similar to the idea of a Medium Place in the show or to the first circle of Hell in Dantes Divine Commedy reserved for virtuous pagans. In this model, the more immoral you are, the more severely youre punished in the afterlife.

The problem with this model is that it encourages mediocrity. Given how difficult it usually is to act perfectly morally, a lot of people would probably settle for living somewhat immoral lives and then spending their afterlife in less than perfect conditions.

We can do better than that.

*Model 4: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place but its possible to erase their effects*

This is similar to a lot of Christian models  sinners are send to Hell, but its possible to erase effects of your sins during life in some way, e.g. by asking for forgiveness or by buying indulgences.

The obvious problem with this system is that a lot of people will act immorally because they know they can get rid of effects of their actions later. There are many examples of this in the history of Christianity, e.g. priests often asked for preemptive forgiveness for soldiers before battles so that the soldiers could go on and kill their enemies and not end up in Hell after theyre killed themselves. 

Moreover, the idea that even extremely immoral people who ask for forgiveness shortly before they die end up in the Good Place together with people who were not immoral at all seems very unjust.

*Model 5: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place but moral actions offset their effects*

This is essentially the model presented in the show. The problem with this is that it doesnt really discourage people from acting immorally, it only encourages them to keep their score balanced.

In this system, a person contemplating murder could conclude that its ok to do it as long as they act sufficiently morally afterwards. A person who has been sufficiently moral so far might even think that they can murder freely because they can afford it.

This is how apparently a lot of Christians thought about morality in the Middle Ages  rulers often believed they can offset effects of their unjust wars by donating to the church. Think of Henry V in Shakespeares play, who built churches to offset negative effects of his father unjustly murdering Edward II and seizing the throne.

In the show, this problem doesnt exist because people dont know the model is in place so they cannot game it. But that violates one of our assumption  people need to know that a model is in place, because a model they dont know about will hardly discourage them from committing immoral actions.

*Model 6: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place, moral actions offset their effects, but people dont know by how much*

*This is my proposed system and I would argue its the most efficient one* (in terms of discouraging people from committing immoral actions during life).

This is very similar to the model presented in the show with one very important difference. People know they will be judged for their actions, they know that moral actions offset immoral actions, but *they dont know by how much*.

Theres a final score of your moral and immoral actions calculated after you die and everyone above a threshold goes to the Good Place and everyone below it goes to the Bad Place. But people dont know what this threshold is (and therefore dont know how difficult it is to get to the Good Place) and dont know by how much a moral action offsets effects of an immoral action.

For example, if you commit a murder, raising 1 million dollars for charity can be more than enough to offset this, or it might not even come close to it. The point is that nobody knows, and nobody knows *on purpose*.

This fundamental uncertainty built into the model is a great motivator for people to try to commit as few immoral actions and as many moral actions as possible. Its difficult to live completely morally. An occasional immoral action isnt the end of the world in this model, because you can always at least try to rectify it by enough moral actions. But because you dont know exactly how many moral actions is enough, you can game the system by only being sufficiently moral by save yourself from the Bad Place.

In this system, people would try to commit as many moral actions and as few immoral actions as possible all the time and theres not loophole out of this system.

But even before the first-season twist, I've been trying to suss out his endgame. So here's my best shot at a Doug Forcett moment.

Eleanor isn't dead. She's dreaming, specifically having recurring dreams of, or is daydreaming in, her ethics class. Which is taught by Chidi. The Good Place? It's a college campus.

Let me make some ""hide in plain sight"" observations:

1) We have no definitive proof that Eleanor has died--or, in fact that anyone has died. We don't see it. We see the set-up for Eleanor's death, but not actual deed. We never saw Jason die, either. We saw a set-up, yes, but not the actual death, either. Of Tahani, we know nothing.

2) Yes, we did see Chidi ""die,"" but in the most ridiculously comical, I-dreamed-of-this-moment way possible. Think about it: Who hasn't wanted to drop a heavy object on a professor's head?

3) One of the constants of all Michael's reboots is that Chidi is teaching a class. It's right there: No matter what else seems to happen in each attempt, we know Eleanor learns about ethics because Chidi is teaching her.

4) Literally the first shot in S1E1 is Eleanor opening her eyes. And that shot has been shown several other times in subsequent reboots. She keeps waking up from dreams (which, of course, are Michael's reboots.)

5) The Good Place looks like a college campus. Everyone is about the same age, which is the demographics of a college campus. We see no old people or children in the population. It's notable that Schur himself went to Harvard. The Good Place seems very much like a stylized sitcom version of a place like Harvard.

6) The events we've seen in the 16 episodes are all dreamlike: Ridiculously named shops, awful clowns, attacks of ridiculous wildlife, sinkholes, flying, dogs booted into the sun, old-timey trains going nowhere, parties that go ridiculously off track, lava monsters and assorted and vivid silliness. This is the stuff that dreams are made of to paraphrase Sam Spade.

7) Michael's open-air, public-square orientations? They've reminded me of something since the beginning. Find the S1 E1 of Community. The very first scene is an open-air, public-square orientation conducted by Dean Pelton of Greendale Community College. It's a cool TV trope now.

Sadly, I'm not as insightful as Doug Forcett. It occurs to me that even in this Eleanor-is-dreaming-and-this-is-college scenario, there's an alternate explanation: Michael could be the ethics teacher. See, especially, the scavenger-hunt episode of the Paper Chase where John Houseman's character teaches his students about contract law by constructing a scavenger hunt that can only be won if the students work together and write a contract. The core four could be a study group trying to ace Michael's ethics course. The Good Place may be Schur's inspired variation on Dan Harmon's Community. 

But I think, at heart, this could be the answer. Schur is a master of ensemble comedy with a single ""sit"" where diverse people interact: the local government in Pawnee (Parks &amp; Rec) or a cop house in Brooklyn (Brooklyn Nine-Nine). He honed his sitcom skills on a show about an office in Scranton (The Office). A college is a similarly perfect ""sit."" 

Or, of course, I could be wrong and, like Eleanor, everyone gets run over by a truck ... Or, for us older viewers with a darker outlook on life and ethics, Schur could be reimagining the dreamy, repeat-it-over-and-over lesson of Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner.

* Considering the welcome video that portrayed Michael as good and Trevor as bad. So it's obviously a fake video, as Michael isn't good. It may be a clue that it isn't a real middle place.

* Mindy compares herself to Eleanor making Eleanor feel worse about herself. 

* They are miserable whenever they are there. 

* They get into arguments with each other.

* They always have to begrudgingly make a big decision which means going back. 

* Mindy grosses them out, and is mostly unhelpful.

* Jason couldn't figure out how to sleep with his wife

* Elanor gets freaked out by the I love you (And this pretty much forces them together very early in the show, so I think that the point was to upset her).

* They are always forced to leave. 


* Sean and Michael knew they took the train, and they know they can take the train in the future. Why would they allow them to just take the train to the middle place if they figure it out? Also if it was really a train out of the bad place, and could possibly get to the real bad place or a better place than the middle, then last thing they would want to happen is for them to get on the train.

I think that there are the same type of clues about the Good place being the bad place, as there are with the middle place. But ultimately I think that the way the bad place works, is that it is more like Dante, with various levels of hell. They all got sent to not the even worse place, and they find an better place. But ultimately they are just the various steps of hell.

Michael Schur shows tend to have some of my favorite relationships (Ben &amp; Leslie from Parks &amp; Rec, Pam &amp; Jim from The Office), and I'm loving the Eleanor/Chidi dynamic.

There have been a few moments over the course of the show that really stuck out to me: 

1. I loved how the first thing Eleanor thought to write down when she was about to be re-booted was ""Find Chidi."" I'm sure there are a multitude of things that she could have written down or different people she could have chosen to find, but her instinct was to find him. I remember reading an interview with D'Arcy Carden when she said that she kept all of those notes from the different takes because that had strangely affected her. 

2. I found it interesting that when the reveal occurred, Eleanor volunteered Chidi and herself to go to TBP. She was taking a risk and if she was wrong, she and Chidi would have ended up in the bad place together. I love that out of everyone she could have chosen, she chose to have them stay together.

3. When Eleanor revealed to the entire neighborhood that she wasn't supposed to be there, she did that for Chidi. In her time on earth, Eleanor was notoriously selfish. Up until that point, she did everything possible, no matter how crazy, to protect herself from being found out. But she basically threw that all away for Chidi. And I love that Chidi chose to help Eleanor in the first place and even stood up to Michael for her, despite the repercussions. 

4. I'm not convinced the points that Eleanor got for giving Chidi advice about ""Real"" Eleanor were because she gave good advice. I think they were more for her being selfless and being supportive, despite her own feelings. 

4. I love that even though they've been rebooted multiple times, they seem to find each other over and over again. 

5. And even though we didn't see the lead up to how it happened, I love that Eleanor was her most vulnerable admitting she loved him in that video. And I love that Chidi, Mr. Indecisive, was able to easily tell her he loved her back. 

Chidi and Eleanor seem to bring out the best in each other and compliment each other pretty well. Their feelings for each other are done pretty subtly (i.e. looks, glances, smiles, etc etc), but I'm really loving their unconventional, yet sweet dynamic. I think the ""I love you"" scene was huge for Eleanor's character development and I definitely want to see how these two got to that place.

What *was* Michael's original plan? When he's pitching his ""Good Place"" to his bosses, he says he can get them to torture each other for 1000 years. Does this mean they all would continue to believe they were actually in the Good Place? What was he going to do if Eleanor had not figured it out at that moment, and they actually did pick someone to send to the Bad Place since, as Eleanor points out, they can't send them somewhere they already are? Do you think he was planning some kind of staged Deus ex Machina (heh)?

I know it all went off the rails after Eleanor confessed, and he said he was basically improvising from that point on. I'm just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on what his next move would have been, had Eleanor not figured it out. Since he erases their memories every time they figure it out, he must've originally designed it to keep them in the dark about the reality of their situation, but I'm wondering if the whole *Groundhog Day* set up wouldn't be torture enough -- it's kind of *Black Mirror* -ish as well (if you've seen it, you know which episode I'm referring to.) What is his endgame, and why 1000 years? Where do they send them after that? The more traditional torture pits?

Each week there seems to be a twist that creates chaos for him, and in Season 2 he has to keep the secret of his failures from Sean in the same way that Elanor had to keep her secret from him.

Additionally, Sean had an interesting line in the finale of Season 1 that they've been trying to get humans to torture each other for a very long time.

Which with 802 attempts means over 40,000 days or 109+ years.

Which means that conservatively, over a hundred years have passed on the Earth while Eleanor and the gang have been looping through. Possibly MUCH more.

While Janet's memory is wiped each attempt, her knowledge is not. Janet knows everything, although she may not have specifically memories and meaning. Like someone with brain damage may lack their memories of learning the skill, but still have the skill.

We see this in several attempts. Janet is asked by Eleanor or Jason for help, and Janet interprets the question broadly and widely to get them them help they need. Eg. Bringing the 4 humans together. With Jason she was even very creative in interpreting his request, in such a way that suggested she knows exactly what he wants.

A PSA from your friendly neighbourhood mods that we've put a few light rules in place on the Subreddit, primarily around spoilers, so please read!

We've added three simple rules:

**1) Content must be relevant to the TV show The Good Place.**

*Pretty straightforward - we'll remove content that's not about the show, or is only very mildly related.*

**2) No spoilers from the current season in titles**

*Given the nature of the end of Season 1 twist it would be hard to enforce no spoilers from any seasons, so for now we'll go with no spoilers from the current season.*

**3) Spoilers in comments must be spoiler tagged depending on context**

*If you're in a thread on a general topic where spoilers might not be expected, please spoiler tag your comments. Otherwise, it's safe to assume that comment sections may contain spoilers.*

Now that the show is on Netflix and we're getting an influx of new viewers I've gone back through the episode discussion threads from season 1 and deleted any comments that were spoilers from future episodes. There weren't many, except for [episode 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/5p0juq/episode_discussion_s01e12_mindy_st_clair/), since (AFAIK) eps 12 and 13 were played back to back so the episode 12 thread contained spoilers from the finale.

Please let us know if these rules seem sensible, or if you have any other requests for the mod team!

The Good Place? I watched the first seaso and loved it, but a few things irked me in a minor way. Like how convenient everything was, or how when Eleanor was trying to earn points that intention mattered, while tahanis intentions for doing the right thing were decidedly self-centered.

ALL of my minor criticisms of the show were addressed in the finale. Literally everything that has irked me suddenly made sense. It was SUPPOSED to irk me.

So when I think things while watching season 2 like ""how has Shawn not caught onto the fact that Michael is most definitely not on attempt 2"", i rememebr my problems with the first season and realize that I for once have total confidence in the writers to explain everything.

At some point Michael told Shawn about rebooting and Shawn was OK with it, if Micheal could manage everything in a way that officially Shawn isn't aware of it.

Good Place is an experiment, so with every reboot, every minor change they put is giving good or bad result. Reboots should improve how this neighborhood works, even if humans keep figuring it out.

Version 3 ended after an Bad Place obelisk was introduced and it's a dead giveaway that Eleonor will figure it out like in version 1. This fact is a proof that at that point Michael wasn't concerned about another reboot.

The plan was to reboot so many times, that there would be a mutiny in demons, so Michael can team up with humans. Why? To get new research data and find a way to further improve the neighborhood.

Just think about it, there's only one critical flaw in his design. Humans keep figuring out that they are in the bad place.

So, Michael will team up with humans, he will learn with them, or to be honest he will observe how they learn and interact with each other while in class.

Then at the end of the season, there will be a big escape plan to get to a ""Good Place"", then will be trial that will prove that those humans become good enough to be in a real good place and Michael will come with them as he invented a tool to improve medium-bad people to become better persons.

But... it will be Michael and Shawn plan all along. The new Good Place will be just a torture 2.0. They will just eliminate that one design flaw. Humans will now know that they were in a bad place and they earned a good place.

Those 4 humans can even work as a ""judas horse"" for others. This new neighborhood could be populated with more humans, and Eleonor or others could serve as example of souls who escaped the bad place that was supposed to be a good place. It's really hard to justify ""We're in the Bad Place"" when there are 4 people who already been there.

Anyway, I'm just certain there will be a new neighborhood for season 3.",1,3,False,self,,,,,

It was clever, the twist caught me off guard, I fell in love with the characters.

Then CLICK, the reset. We get 3 episodes of do-overs. It was quite cleverly done, showing the different perspectives. But something didn't sit right.

At the end of the last season, Eleanor confessed to being attracted to Tahani, if in an offhanded comment and that it'd be explored later. Jason grew a bit as a character, and his relationship with Janet(and her development) was honestly touching. Chidi and Eleanor gaining a degree of mutual affection that felt natural, and they weren't forced into a ship.

But in S2? Both Jason and Tahani have become flanderised, the focus is much more on Chidi and Eleanor who are now pushed into a ship that feels pretty much confirmed by the sex tapes, Janet's been reset again(and ""growing"" through each iteration, but still without her memories that made her ""our"" Janet)... 

I felt like Season 1 was quite clever in how it portrayed Tahani where she started out as a believable but slightly obnoxious person and the seams slowly came undone. But you still sympathised, and you never felt she was a truly bad person, just petty, and it made you question in turn the pettiness of the system that someone like her would be there.

In Season 2 the emphasis seems to be that everyone's just as bad as each other. In some ways, I don't mind this, I'm glad Tahani was knocked off her pedestal as a disingenous privileged rich girl but it also felt like she started to own herself towards the end of Season 1, only for that to be taken away.

I'm feeling really unsure about the show going forwards. I'm exhausted from all the queerbating, especially when it's *outright declared* rather than the teasey stuff like Swan Queen in Once Upon a Time etc., in getting invested in characters only for them to be reset to a point, which in according to interviews has them at about Episode 4 of Season 1. 

I really want the characters to get their memories from the first Cycle, so bad. I thought this was going to happen, but they wanted to focus on the idea that they'd find each other. I'd LOVE if part of the reason for this was that they were somehow all soulmates together(including Janet), and we got a decent Polyamorous relationship on TV for the first time in maybe forever. 

But I'm really worried that we've already lost the development of Season 1 and the characters we fell in love with. The S1 characters, even Jason, just felt so compelling, sympathetic in their own ways. Now they feel like caricatures, and like Michael's pushing everyone out to become the main character.",4,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

- There is a real 'Bad Place' separate from where #TeamCockroach is now. It actually has people who are being tortured and they are not enjoying it. 

- Mindy St. Claire and TMP are REAL. And it is a neutral zone between TGP and TBP. 

- TGP also exists, and Mindy St. Claire's house is the point between them.

But doesn't Michael need all four of them to reset the neighborhood and start everything over again when they find out? 

Mindy said that ""It's always at least Eleanor and Janet, usually Chidi's in the mix, sometimes Jason is here. One time Jason and Tahani were here."" I'm making the assumption that this means all four of them have never been at Mindy's at the same time (Chidi and Tahani absent the first time, Chidi absent when Jason and Tahani were both there,etc.). I dont think they'd have any reason to leave if all five of the group are safe at Mindy's. But based on the fact that Michael needs all four of them to make the neighborhood work, couldn't they outsmart him and ensure their memories aren't erased again by just leaving someone at the Medium place? Jason isn't exactly necessary for any plans, so couldn't Eleanor have just left him there when she tried her rescue missions, and then if it failed Michael couldn't reset them until he found Jason,  giving them time to formulate a new plan for everyone to escape back to Mindy's? We don't even know that Michael can go into a different neighborhood, we've never seen him do it, but even if he can he'd have no idea where to start looking unless someone snitched.

In this episode, we see Tahani's cause of death was when she tried to tople over a statue of her sister, but it crushed her. 
Being a fan of *Harry Potter*, I have been trying to figure out since about a week before season two started, (which was about a week after I completed my first watch of season one, thanks to Netflix and a professor at school mentioning the show) which Hogwarts house each of the four humans would be in. Here is what I have so far, so I would appreciate feedback on my thoughts and how close or far off base I am:



* **Eleanor**: I believe that Eleanor would be in Ravenclaw. This is particularly because how how in the 802 attempts Michael has made, Eleanor figured it out in almost all of them, with only two or three we know of where she didn't. One of those would be the reset Michael did on accident. On top of this, the ethics lessons were her idea. Eleanor is also very adept at telling lies and deceiving seeing as she was the top salesperson for her company that sold the drugs that didn't work. She was also never was the ""it"" person to be the designated driver, and it was heavily implied she lied and said another's name when she pulled hers, or maybe she always said a random name, who can say? She also Janet to help her do things. So I could also alternatively see an argument for Slytheirn. 



* **Chidi**: Chidi is a tough one. Since he was ""*literally* a college professor"" (his words) you would think that he too would be a Ravenclaw. However, as in the last episode (at the time of posting) Michael said that in all of those attempts, Chidi never refused to help Eleanor. He is a kind soul, he doesn't want to hurt people, (which, despite this hurting people is exactly what he wound up doing because of his  indecision.) So, I would ultimately say that Chidi would be in Hufflepuff. I would then put Ravenclaw next, since as he was a college professor and writer in life, learning must have been important to him. So I would say he is a Hufflepuff with Ravenclaw tendencies (Personally, I am the flip of this).



* **Tahani**: As we know, while Tahani did good deeds in life, she was doing them for a selfish reason. She was despreate to get out from her sister's shadow. But in doing all of those noble things for the wrong reasons, such as raising  5,000,000 for charity and planing on going to help the less fortunate, but it was all to try and outshine Kamela, if only for a brief moment. I fell that Tahani would ultimately be in Slytherin, for her cunning ways, such as that she snuck into the Hall of Fame Induction for her sister, and the fact that she was trying to positively influence her points with a readout stating she was next to last in her neighborhood back in Season One. I am not sure how to offically rule this for her, but I am thinking that she might be a Slytherin with Hufflepuff traits.



* **Jianyu/Jason**: This is the only one that I am not entirely sure about. Jason is an idiot, so he likely wouldn't be in Ravenclaw. He doesn't seem to be all that cunning, (unless he later reveals that he has been playing dumb, which I do not really see coming. Let alone the fact that it would resend my arguments for him to not be in Ravenclaw or Slytherin,) But from there I am stuck.

So, what does everyone think? I'd particularly like to hear from other fans of *Harry Potter*. Do you think I am right on what I have laid out? Do you have any evidence to contradict my claims?

Additionally, I was not initally planing on including Michael or Janet in this. But, if I had to pick I'd say Miachel would be Slytherin with Ravenclaw tendencies and Janet would be hard to place since she is essentially an AI unit. She has infinite knowledge and is able to get just about anything for people. She also has become very human-like with those 802 reboots. I would say that she would like be a Ravenclaw with Hufflepuff tendencies.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Elanor - Comes from a family who pretty much didn't care 2 shirts about her. This will result in Elanor moving out to live on her own at a young age as she vrutually been rasing herself on her own up to this point anyway. The fact that she is had to do everything on her own and her parents were no help to her is the reason she is so selfish and mean to others around her. Eleanor feels she can't rely on anyone to support her or be there for her for anything as its wired in her brain that in the end she will be dissapointed and can only rely on herself.

Tahani -  Her life seems perfect with a nice house, nice life with everything she could want granted to her no problem. However, Tahani parents care more about the accomplishment of her sister Tahani feels like she isn't apart of the family almost like the unwanted step child. This resentment not having the apprecation of her parents starts to build her jelliousy and hatetread from her sister. In adult her she goes out and does all these big events and charitys not because she cares about anyone she helping , honestly deep down I think living Tanhani could care less about people she finds benith her but she thinks doing all these things will give her attention and a public status that puts her equal or better. Unforcentlly none of this does any good. When Tehani talks with the Interviewer she will get to talk about herself and how great her accomplishment is only find out the woman (or anyone really) cares about her and what she does it's still about her sister. Tahani becomes so overwelmed she stoops as low as to sneak into the party just to cause a secne and ulterimently cause her own death in anger. 

Living Eleanor did not care about anyone but herself but was dying for someone to love and care about her no matter what. Living Tahani would have not cared about people like Eleanor and only acted like this loving supporting person to gain the love and appreciation she felt nobody was giving her.  Tahani did charity acts in order to be liked and noticed meanwhile Eleanor (for a short time) a person who did simlar acts just to feel accepted in The Good Place. 

When the two meet for the first time and through the reboots it's expected the two will hate each other. Elenaor still being selfish and careless of others feelings and Tahani still acting like she is the greatest thing to exisit. Overtime they learn that the people around them love and support them. That neither of them are perfect and both are falwed for the same reason just with altered takes. Chidi help Eleanor see not everyone is like her parents and caring about other people will make them want to care about you. While Jason in a weird way showed Tahani she needs to stop trying to impress people to be cared about just be you and do what you love (what ever she really likes doing). The right people will give you the appreciation and love that you need...if anything love yourself. Jason is a complete idiot who fails at almost everything he does but he makes the best of it and manages to stay postive. The dude got a Jennet to marry him. 

Shortly these two are a perfect balance of the same and different. Each has somthing to offer the other and connect on a emotional and personal level. There was also that one notion when Elenaor said she had feeling for her. ~~If anything they are best friends~~

I was thinking about Tahani being used as one of Eleanor's soulmates in the many different resets. Basically if they can use one of the four - or literally anyone - to be Eleanor's soulmate that kind of renders the concept meaningless. There isn't actually a soulmate for anyone, considering everyone else in town is an ""actor"", and they can use a freaking dog if they want. No matter who Eleanor's soulmate was, she found her way back to Chidi, Jason and Tahani. 

So my thinking is these four are actually all soulmates. Perhaps this is something Michael overlooked, or something he just never considered. But it might solve why so much effort was allowed to be put into this whole experiment for just four people. 

(side note: since ""real Eleanor"" was a demon too, that could mean Michael is just telling the four some random stories about how they died, as real Eleanor was not actually trying to save Eleanor at all, she wasn't even there, obviously. We know they don't seem to recall their own deaths so Michael could literally tell them anything)

So what if the main four somehow all died in a way that connected them and they're actually ""destined"" to always end up together somehow? 

And furthering that, now that Michael is agreeing to join them in ethics, maybe he too will discover he actually needs them or it'll be revealed he was assigned to them for a reason? 

(Also I'm going by the concept of soulmate not being a romantic thing btw, just a general destiny/fate thing)",18,24,False,spoiler,,,,,

Like Michael knows everything about everything, right? And Janet's database contains every fact in the universe or something.

Yet Michael can't predict the future when Jason asks him if the Jaguars will ever win the Superbowl. So it's not unreasonable to assume they only know facts as they happen on Earth, or at least Earth's realm/universe/whatever. After all, the demons point out a few times how unpredictable humans can be and it's an interest of Michael's (at least when he was acting as a Good Place guy) to learn about human stuff because of unpredictability and what not.

Anyway, the mindfork for me comes to the fact that they've been in a loop for anywhere from 200 to 300 years in all 800ish attempts. And Jason asked him if the Jaguars won the Superbowl *last year*. Like what is ""last year"" at this point? Wouldn't Earth be centuries ahead of them by then? 

But another thing to note is how Michael talks a lot about ""timeline"". So say they died in 2016, maybe every time they get rebooted another timeline adjacent to Earth's 2016 time is created?

But that's still a huge mindfork, as Mindy never gets rebooted and remembers all their previous visits... Someone in another thread suggested that Michael's neighborhood is in some sort of a time bubble, such that they always get rebooted to the same day so that regardless of the attempt number, if they go to Mindy's on day 14 of their attempt, and on day 16 in a different attempt, to Mindy's perspective, they would have popped up 2 days apart and would explain why she's pissed of always seeing them even though it's only like 15 times in 200-300 years and yet she's heard the same stuff enough to quote them verbatim.

But I'm not sure if that makes sense, cause the very first time they saw Mindy it was weeks into attempt #1 so Mindy would have told them ""you guys again?"" or something.

Did I miss any detail that would make sense? Obviously on a more ""this is a show"" level, the Jaguar thing was just a throwaway joke, or might just have been a freebie for Michael to slightly torture Jason, who knows. But still how does time work?",3,11,False,spoiler,,,,,

But at the end of Team Cockroach, she shows that she clearly *doesn't* know everything. She didn't realize she'd been rebooted 802 times, and she seemed to just be figuring out that there were only 4 humans in the neighborhood.

So my question is this. 

Why didn't the gang just ask Michael to give them back the erased memories? 

I figured maybe the reason why Eleanor figured out they were in the bad place every time except for that one instance was because part of her memory somewhere deep inside had inklings of the first timeline. But wait there's more, here's another question. 

Does anyone else think that Michael is in a prison of his own making now and that those in the real bad place do actually know of his multiple failed attempts but erased his memory allowing him to believe they don't know?

Why would it even be possible if it wasn't meant to occur?  Michael goes so far as to state that getting to the Good Place isn't even a real issue, the problem is convincing them to let you stay.  We've also seen evidence that someone's points are still tracked and can change after they go to the Bad Place, which (again, assuming it wasn't trickery) wouldn't make sense if someone was eternally condemned there.  

If being tortured is normally a way for souls to make up for their sins/negative points/etc until they're worthy of the Good Place, then tricking them into torturing each other would ostensibly mean they could never leave. What else (besides sheer eternal boredom) would explain why so many demons are willing to spend decades going along with Michael's convoluted plan, the kind of time/effort/resources devoted to it, and the accolades Michael believes he'll receive?  It would all make sense if the Bad Place is constantly losing souls, and Michael's experiment could potentially lead to a truly grand prize: a way to torture and hold onto people for eternity.  

Many people have pointed out that the fake ""Good Place"" doesn't really seem so bad compared to what other condemned souls are being tortured with, but if Michael's solution exponentially delayed redemption into the Good Place (or prevented it outright), then it would represent a much more significant advancement.  It would also be the kind of twist that seems consistent with the show thus so far.

Theres something much broader happening that will be revealed in the last episode of s2, lets put our heads together and see what we come up with.       
  
Here are all the odd things out in my opinion, that could be clues to something:  
  
Janet- She being stolen from a real Good Place, how can she be stolen if shes this robot-like thing that pops into existence when you call her name. What ties her to this area, and what are her boundaries if she is capable of going to The Medium Place?  
  
Jason- Theres just something fishy about him. Hes almost too stupid, like hes faking. Is he a plant to keep an eye on things from the inside? Isnt he (in most attempts) the one to always reveal himself to Eleanor first so she realizes she isnt the only mistake in the Good Place. Two mistakes in such a perfect place might be the reason she figures out its actually the Bad Place.  
  
Points System- If you take everything at face value, I think we can all agree the points system and the sheer 1% v. 99% thing going on with the Good/Bad Places is ridiculous. Our 4 humans are in no way deserving to be tortured for eternity. I think they took a broad spectrum of Medium people to test. Is Michael not actually an architect, but a judge of purgatory to see how these people truly are to decide if they belong to the Good or Bad? Is the points system bullshirt, and everyone is tortured in the afterlife? What is going on with that.  
  
Population of the afterlife- It seems unreasonable that a Good/Bad place even exists in the afterlife, and theres only one person in the Medium Place. How many architects are there for such an insane amount of dead people, and why does Michael only get 4 to play around with? Seems too inefficient. And I find it fishy that weve only seen and know about this fake Good Place.

I always assumed, though I don't think it's ever literally spelled out, that she died on her birthday.


Why: 

1) Her birthday is repeatedly brought up in different ways leading up to her death. (Her emancipation - her parents didn't remember her birthday again, bringing her own cake to the office, crashing the Quinceanera, fudging her birth year as older to get a job or younger cause ya know, Janet's discussion of her birthday smash cake (to continue thematically), I feel like I'm missing one or two.

2) The shittiness of her birthdays triggers her to binge crap food and shrimp, plan her weekend of binging -ending with ""falling asleep on her vibrator and be super shitty at the grocery store in the finale (just like at the Quince).

3) She checks her horoscope in the grocery store line. People do this on their birthdays. The horoscope itself makes her remark upon her own immortality.

Perhaps her death day is her 2nd rebirthday; a 2nd-800something rebirth at being reborn as a new and better Eleanor?


Do we assume she died in 2015 or 2016?

So Officially:

Eleanor Shellstrop
10/13/1982 Phoenix, Arizona - 10/13/201x Phoenix, Arizona?

(Alternative Factually:
10/13/1986 Phoenix, Arizona - 10/13/201x Phoenix, Arizona)

...That they are actually in The Good Place?
It really makes very little sense that they would be in The Bad Place. Firstly, after finding each other and falling in love countless times, I think it is fairly safe to say that Eleanor and Chidi actually are soul mates. Chidi and Tahani are both basically mandatory for the experiment due to it being such a rarity for bad people to genuinely think they are good like they do, but Eleanor is certainly replaceable. It makes no sense at all to stick Chidi's soulmate in there with him if it genuinely was The Bad Place.

Secondly, if it really was The Bad Place, Michael's entire plan would have to rank in as one the most stupid decisions ever made. It would always be doomed to failure, resulting in his own demise - that certainty is so extreme that one would have to assume his only intention when starting out was suicide. No amount of mental anguish could hold a candle to a good old fashioned liver pecking - especially when it has limitless free yogurt, cocaine, or whatever else the humans want sprinkled in there. Even if it was The Bad Place, there is simply way too much good sprinkled in there for it to ever compete with more traditional torture methods. It is also horrendously inefficient - his method takes more than 300 people to torture 4. Traditional torture methods could be pulled off with a single torturer (or even less! In mythology, the hells devised for the titans were all automated).

Michael's plan could never even come close to the effectiveness of regular torture, even if it was achieved flawlessly. Therefore if everything was as it seems to us, he would be bound for a most unpleasant fate the very minute he devised his plan and that truth is obvious enough that he would have to know about that certainty himself.

And there lies the problem with how the story has been presented - torture is just too easy. It really doesn't need a reinvention of the wheel. The opposite is true of eternal bliss. The problem with eternal bliss is that eternal anything becomes a whole lot like torture once you do it too much - you would feel every second of that eternity and it would drive you insane. The only way to prevent that eventuality would be with regular mind wipes. That is what I believe Michael is up to - he isn't inventing a new Bad Place, he is inventing a new Good Place. His plan is to mix a slight amount of drama with the regular combination of soul mates and Janet satisfying all of your wants; in order to create a Good Place that never gets stale enough to warrant a mind wipe.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

I hate theorizing using minute cues, because, just like The Office, things are so subtle, that you have to decipher between the writers' intentions, the actor's ability to pull off an amazingly subtle facial expression. I trust Ted Danson's abilities, but that loops around to the writers' *intentions* and also the actor's *interpretation*. I mean, I know that doesn't sound like anything terrible, but if you then take that and add this incredible sense of anxiety of what this realm even is, who's bad or good.

* *Regularly and definitively talks about how he's in paradise, ""I'm in a perfect utopia and I'm getting a stomach ache"".*

* *""Eleanor, this place is a perfectly made Swiss watch, and you are a wrench in the gears. Actually, you're a hammer, just smashing the gears into dust.""*

* *""No, you don't belong here. And in this place, everyone is better than you. It has been proven by an infallible formula.""*

The demons get to be as outlandish with the torture as they want without tipping their hands, because the humans already know.

The humans will bug the crap out of each other with their inherent personality conflicts.

Think about it: The logic of the current situation is that Vicki will do no better a job as boss than Michael. Eventually Shawn will find out. And then I think we can look to what Michael said: The best lie is one that is close to the truth.

What happens when Shawn finds out? He reports up the org chart and the Bad Place bosses send a REAL judge to decide if Michael should be retired.

The judge decides that, yes, Michael must be retired. Michael then arranges for the crew to escape to a good place neighborhood.

In fact, it probably should be pretty easy. For starters, Michael must have some connection to the good place since he stole a good Janet. And why can't Michael just tell Janet they want to visit another neighborhood? Since Janet technically doesn't know this is the Bad Place, she takes them to a Good Neighborhood--and we start again with the original premise: People who don't belong in the Good Place have to hide and try to fit in...

Mindy St. Clair died in the 1980s (shown by her outfit, house decor, pop-culture items in her house, and her obsession with cocaine). 

Michael is shown to MAYBE know the future. (I forget which episode it was, but it was implied he knows what happens in the ""future"" on earth because the concept of time does not apply to an immortal demon). 

The four main characters on the show were born in the 1980s. This is exactly around the time Mindy St.Clair died. 

When Mindy died, they hd no idea where to put her. She didn't belong in The Good Place and she didn't belong in The Bad Place. The Medium place was created. 

What if Michael is actully trying to prove there is no need for a ""Medium Place,"" and that he could force humans to make each other better and be eligible to go to the real Good Place (meaning the characters are in Purgatory of sorts) OR that they actually belong in The Bad Place? Meaning, Michael knew from the moment these four characters were born that they would end up in the Medium Place and started to create this experiment to ensure no one would ever get placed in The Medium Place again, they would have to prove where they truly belonged. 

If Eleanor finds out too soon that they are in The Bad Place (in the experiment), then it ruins Michael's plan. Once the four characters find out they are ""bad,"" they will give up on trying to be good.

I definitely want to start another thread just to laud the brilliance of the many great one-liners on the show.

That said, I've been rewatching S1 to try to catch possible nuances I missed the first time around and a few things are bothering me:

* Why didn't anyone call out the fact that Trevor (Adam Scott's character) started the train back to the Bad Place with the ""good"" Eleanor still on there? From the perspective of an exchanging of gold and bad Eleanors that wouldn't have made any sense.
* Anyone else feel like we are missing a lot of Chidi's backstory? Being indecisive doesn't seem like enough for eternal damnation, and the indecisiveness didn't even seem blatant enough to show up til the end of the season, for the most part. In contrast, Tahani seems pretty arrogant from S1E1. 
* The good things Mindy did don't seem nearly good enough to counterbalance the bad, not to mention based on what we know about Chidi, Tahani, or Jason, she doesn't seem any less good/bad than them. They haven't really sold me on why she'd be special enough to warrant her own special Medium Place with no one else in the same bucket.

Eleonor wakes up and she's ""I had a really weird dream last night"" and then she would go to Chidi, who would deny this, like others.

I think that, as the series progresses and the characters develop (particularly with stronger senses of morality), we will see different character adopt different philosophical stances. In fact, I think this can already be seen happening. As a result, I would like to attempt to predict the stances of the main five based on the evidence we have seen so far. 

I feel I should warn you: I am an ameteur philosopher. I have not studied any of this formally, and mostly have vague knowledge on these subjects. I apologize for any mistakes I make.

**Chidi**

While Chidi is the professor of philosophy, he does seem to favour the teachings of Immanuel Kant. In addition to a lost notebook of Kant's being Chidi's present in the most recent episode, one of Chidi's core beliefs is that lying is *always* wrong. This is a belief that he shares with Immanuel Kant, who also believed that lying was always wrong, even though there are instances where lying would do more good than bad (lying to protect a good person from eternal torture, for example). Chidi frequently holds Kant in high regards, and I believe that Chidi's overall philosophy is most similar to Kants', particularly when compared to the other characters.

**Eleanor**

Eleanor's philosophy seems to be primarily utilitarian (you remember utilitarianism, right? The outcome that results in the most happiness for the most people is the best outcome) This is easily seen in her reaction to utilitarianism - she basically flat out says it's her favourite philosophy, questioning why they had to learn all the others. She also demonstrates utilitarianism as a second instinct in the most recent episode when considering the Trolley Problem, with her first instinct being to kill someone she doesn't like. Utilitarianism seems to suit Eleanor, and I suspect as she develops, she will be more and more utilitarianist.

**Michael**

Michael has only really shown any signs of ethical growth in the two most recent episodes, but it distinctly suggests that he will be an existentialist. Existentialism is a very complex subject, but from browsing the Wikipedia page for it, there are a few points. First off, as the name implies, existentialism is very firmly tied to existential dread and existential crisis, which were the focus of the episode by the same name - Michael had an existential crisis, beginning his journey as an existentialist. As well, existentialists typically think of normal teaching methods as too abstract, which easily relates to his attempt at learning through actually experiencing the trolley problem (regardless of what Chidi thinks, or how it turned out, I do think that the initial attempt at least was driven by a sincere desire to learn.) Finally, one of Michael's biggest challenges if he does take the path of the existentialist is that of the Absurd, and the idea that there is no absolute meaning in the universe. This seems to directly conflict with the points system that Michael holds so dearly, and will likely be a major source of conflict.

**Jason**

I have difficulty pinning down Jason and Tahani with firm philosophies. The best I have for Jason (after five minutes on Wikipedia) is Idealism. Essentially, idealism questions the reality of reality itself. This does vaguely fit with his constant assertion that they are on a prank show. As well, Jason seems to be the most accepting of wackiness around them, often contributing to it (Magic Panda, anyone?) Honestly, part of the reason I chose this is that the wikipedia page for idealism mentions Buddhism, and I think it would be ironic if the guy pretending to be a Buddhist monk adopted a philosophy related to Buddhism.

**Tahani**

Again, really hard time with this one. Going with materialism. She seems really focused on physical objects, including focusing more on the results of her actions on Earth than on the intent behind them. As well, her present from Michael was a diamond, again reinforcing her focus on physical objects. Probably not the best fit, but I would prefer to have something for each character so as to spark discussion.

**Janet?**

Honestly, Janet so far doesn't seem to really concern herself with Ethics. Based on the ending of the most recent episode, I suspect that may change next week, but for now, I have less for her than I did for Jason or Tahani.",3,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

I literally had to stop watching and come back after a huge brain thingie. Probably wrong. All my gambles are. Pants-heavying epiphany though! 

===

My prediction is **Eleanor is the next Michael**. By season's end she will, through some scheme or another, succeed Michael's role as architect to 1) save Michael from ""retirement"" 2) save everyone else from the Worse Place/hard reset and 3) save herself in her fashionably self-destructive, manipulatively good-hearted way.  Everyone will be staring down the barrel of damnation toward the end and this will fix it as an obviously terrible stopgap that promises a whole new cascade of hijinks and redemption in season 3. I even believe this could happen an episode or two before season's end, just to pre-twist another twist, but I absolutely believe it's going to happen. IT'S FORKING KISMET.

I shuddered when I played back the scene and saw Eleanor realizing it again when Michael kept talking to Chidi.

It's a silly show at times and the ethics teaching plot gets stale fast so it's difficult to always be inventive enough to keep it funny and entertaining but the dark humor is too much at times. It seems every episode is like this and repetition doesn't make it any less unsettling. We're in psychopath territory and they could ease up a little. 

I don't know though, maybe this is what keeps this show from being completely average, and I do like it but it's really scary sometimes. People complained about not being being able to watch Westworld but it seems like this show is worse than Westworld in that regard because when after the first few episodes of Westworld I was over the feeling bad about the robots' humanity.

So a number of folks here (myself included) believe that Janet's glitching is due to her Ride or Die protocol, and how her couple's counseling of Jason and Tahani is violating her wedding vows to Jason in Attempt #1.

I believe that The Trolley Problem is a setup for a genuine ethical dilemma that Michael will face in next week's episode.  Michael, as the only person on the team with memories from Attempt #1, will figure out the reason for the glitches, and be forced to take drastic action in an attempt to save the neighborhood (including all of the demons like Vicki).  Either he'll have to kill Janet once more, wipe Jason and Tahani's memories (including memories of their relationship), or somehow expel them from the neighborhood.  So does he sacrifice a couple of people (or one not-robot) to save the entire neighborhood?

I'm still skeptical that Michael is really trying to help the humans, but being forced to face a genuine moral dilemma could really put him on the path toward a greater sense of empathy for humanity.",12,77,False,spoiler,,,,,

It was integral to the plot - Tahani was the person you were most sure actually BELONGED there. She was a little annoying and occasionally pompous, but for the most part a generally nice and considerate seemingly person. As the show goes on, we realise how much she does for appearances, to better her sister, etc. generally for the wrong reason. And then we find out they're in the bad place, and we(and the characters) still wonder if she REALLY belongs there.

In Season 2 Tahani seems almost hedonistic in a sense, lusting after large diamonds and sex with Jason. But above all the stereotypical spoiled rich girl, which I don't really think was Season 1 Tahani or I would have hated her. She gave that impression at first, maybe, but then you get to see she has layers - both getting you to realise why she's in the bad place but also sympathising with her and rendering her more likeable as a character. 

Obviously I dislike the Jason ship as a Jason/Janet and Eleanor/Tahani(or Eleanor/Tahani/Chidi?) shipper but something about it really bothers me aside from it throwing away a lot of S1 character development(which is why the reset plot annoys me - I hope Janet gives them back their first cycle memories). 

People were expressing concerns over Jason's character, and he seemed a bit more like his S1 self this episode, which I was thankful for, but both Jason an Tahani still had those ""moments"" with the reverse tortures. 

The way in which Eleanor and Tahani became best friends in Season 1 despite all odds was so good and so believable somehow despite them being very different people.

I'm a really big fan of this show but new to this discussion, so forgive me if this has been posted or asked before. I just really need help understanding the character of Chidi, I don't get him at all, and I was wondering what clues and contexts I missed out on here. What follows is my all my personal perspective/assumptions about Chidi.

Chidi, from what I understand, is a  big time moral philosophy geek. So much so that he has dedicated his whole life to understanding moral philosophy, a complicated subject that asks questions like ""What does it mean for a person to be good?""

Except in this universe, we have an extremely concrete answer to this question. Chidi has never questioned this once (or has he??).  He has accepted an extremely simple solution to basically every problem in the subject of moral philosophy. You get plus points for good actions, which I assume are stored in some sort of grand list, and negative points for bad actions. If your net score is above a certain threshold then you are a good person, as seen by admittance to 'the good place'.

I think there is a real good place (I use as evidence the existence of a medium place) and that the point system is actually the law of the afterlife (I use as evidence Michael's discussions after he has been outed, and once again, the existence of a medium place as told by Janet, a 'good' character). 

Why does Chidi never question this once? Why does he express desire to continue work on his manuscript when he knows the answers to these fundamental questions? I'm a math student myself... if someone told me they had the answers to the greatest mysteries in math beyond a doubt, I would be skeptical. I would challenge them. I would at least want to take a look at how they did it, because I really care about math.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the last episode, the trolley problem.  From what I understand, the trolley problem is an impossible moral dilemma because there's no 'right' answer. Do you willingly kill someone? Or do you passively kill even more people? There are arguments to be made for both. Chidi says this himself.

But not in this universe. In this universe, the trolley problem has a solution. It's no longer a dilemma. Compute the total points for each action (switch tracks versus do nothing) and determine which is higher in order to select the objectively 'better' option. If both totals are the same, then you can say without a doubt that the choice is essentially meaningless. How can Chidi still say there is no right answer? Why has he accepted the 'reality' of this point/place system so readily??

It's archaic... I think anyone can tell you that there is more to moral philosophy than moral spreadsheets. So I don't get how Chidi is on board with this at all.  It makes me question Chidi's identity and the entire premise of the show. Please help me understand!!",12,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

I almost walked out on the show after Elanor outed herself, and the other members ers of the neighborhood were indifferent to the prospect of her being tortured in the Bad Place. I said ""These aren't good people, good people would never willingly give up someone to be tortured for their convenience."" I still didn't get it, I thought it was obtuse writing, because there are a lot of people and some theologies which teach that people in Heaven have no problem with people being tortured because they are so in line with divine will.

But there's another question, along these lines. Is the show ever going to address that the very notion that people aren't ALLOWED to change, not ALLOWED to grow, not ALLOWED to ever be worthy. Whether the humans are having their memories erased or being brutalized in normal bad place.

Should I assume that Shur is comfortable with people being subjected to SAW like tortures for the crime of being fundamentally inadequate. Shur's trying not to step on any toes with this being ""The Good Place"" but the doctrine of eternal damnation, as opposed to Hell itself, is smug, it's mean-spirited and so cruel that genuinely good people would reject the Good Place as a moral imperative. To give sanction to such a system goes against everything we as human beings consider truly good.

Or is that the last test? Even Chidi isn't truly disturbed by the vast disappropriate retribution the Bad Place is supposed to enact. Is the last test to truly be a good person, to understand that that the system as Michael has decribed it, is so unjust that partaking of it is corrupting in and of itself?

3. Constantly tempt them with the possibility that they could get something better like a better spouse, a better widget, a better abode, better food, better friends, better leaders, etc. but have all attempts to change make your life worse.

4. Remind them daily that their existence is finite.

5. Have others constantly trying to take their time/stuff/safety/independence.

My theory is that each glitch isn't random, they are puns or references that illustrate how she is feeling/what she is doing. All of this  is working under the assumption that A) Janet is Good and B) Janet wants/is programmed first and foremost, to make people happy. 



1) She loses her thumb (it floats up into a balloon over her head? Although it reappears on her hand later) when she agrees to be Jason and Tihani's couples therapist.
---- Possible reference: Losing her thumb could be a reference to the classic magic trick where a thumb appears to disconnect and reappear on a hand- using slight of hand. Often used to trick small children and amuse them. 
 --- Therefore, Janet might be humoring or playing with J+T. Perhaps she doesn't really think their relationship will work?

2) A frog in her throat, upon seeing J+T's first real breakthrough, and they embrace and kiss. 
---- A Frog in your throat is an American idiom. It means to sound hoarse, or have difficulty speaking. 
--- This seems like the most obvious but bare with me. Janet is unable to express her emotional response to seeing the two kiss, and is therefore temporarily unable to express herself. 

3) and 3 the entire place shakes with an apparent earthquake that appears legitimately dangerous. 
--- Janet's glitch is about to ""Bring the House down"" as it were, an idiom meaning getting a cheer or applause due to a great performance. 
--- Janet does such a good job making T+J happier in their relationship she is getting a standing ovation? Honestly I want more help with this one. Any ideas what this idiom could mean? Or is the shaking a reference to a different saying?

All of these have to do with T+J's growing relationship, and could be a reflection of her feelings watching Jason move on to someone else. Even though rationally she must know that Jason doesn't remember the reboot where she marries him. Also, if she is programmed to firstly try and make/keep humans happy T+J should be a good thing- but if her own feelings are starting to strain her first line of programming (her 0th law if you will) that is the source of the glitch!

It is the only show i am currently watching.  I have a TON of questions that i would liked answered.  

1. Can Michael go to the medium place?

2. What would happen if they ask Janet to take them to the Good place?  This irks me a little. They know she can go to the medium place but have made no attempt to be taken to the Good Place. 

3. Why have they not asked to talk to loved ones that have died or may have died? They seem quite selfish not asking at this point in the game. 

4. If Janet has all the knowledge of the universe, why has none of the characters tried to  ask her anything.  like: Who shot JFK? What is god like? Are there other intelligent life besides humans?  It seems like Chidi should be asking Janet a lot more questions. 

5. Is Chidi being in the bad place a mistake?  Fan theory, Chidi is in the bad place because Elanore is his soul mate.  

6. Is the Good place outside of time or running concurrently with time?

7. Will we see the actual Good Place?

8. Will we see people from the characters past life?

9. Does the medium place have a janet? 

10. Is reincarnation possible? ",18,16,False,self,,,,,

Michael wiping their memories has to do with their mental cognition (and it's interesting that that continues in the afterlife, along with physical sensations like enjoying the taste of food or sex)...

BUT I don't think we necessarily have to worry about ""all the season 1 character development"" being thrown out just because he kept resetting their memories. Everything that I've seen so far seems to suggest that they have retained the most important thing, something which may go deeper than their memories... their souls! 

And along with it... the *character* of their souls, and their soul connections.

Why else is Chidi so much more decisive and bold? Why is Tahani more honest? Why is Eleanor so nice and buddy-buddy when her whole life she was antisocial and selfish? Why does Tahani find herself attracted to Jason beyond all reason?

Still thinking about this, but I think there's something deeper going on behind all the reboots. Another comment on this board pointed this out re: Janet -- amnesia is one thing, death is another. Michael's only been resetting their memories, not their souls.",4,31,False,self,,,,,

i think TGP people set up this whole thing, somehow put the idea of the fake GP neighborhood into michael's head and made it easy for him to get a real janet, because they knew being around something so good like janet would help him see the error in his ways. if you're surrounded by shitty people, it's hard not to be shitty. but meet someone (like janet) who challenges your worldview and shows you what true friendship is? that can be a real game changer.
