As long as you don't fall into negatives, you end up in the good place. 

2) We're taking for granted that Eleanor and Jason don't belong there because they kinda seem like bad people. But they both could have barely squeaked by. 

3) The goal of the good place is for everyone there to be happy for eternity. Neither Jason nor Eleanor were happy as the people they were.

4) The neighborhood is perfectly crafted. Not just all the frozen yogurt shops, but each of the people is perfectly selected for the betterment of each other person. 

5) They know how Eleanor died. It wasn't how someone who goes on hunger-strikes and brings aid to Africa died. It seems how she must have actually died. 

--

My theory based on above evidence.

Michael (or God or whoever) intentionally made Eleanor, Jason and potentially others believe they were in the Good Place accidentally so that they would try to better themselves because that self-betterment will inevitably lead to their true happiness.

He didn't have to fudge everything. Perhaps her video memories were visions of what could've been. Her house was an obvious red flag. Michael told Jason he was a monk before he could ruin it for himself and even got his name wrong. (Because Jason is stupid and they had to be even more obvious.)

The people in the neighborhood all work together like interlocking gears.

Chidi loves to teach ethics. 
Eleanor needs to learn to be a better person.

Tahani needs a friendly rival. Competition makes her better.
Eleanor needs someone envy to drive her to better herself.

Eleanor needs Jason to feel like she's not the worst.
Jason needs Eleanor to help him make better choices.

TL/DR: Eleanor belongs there. They made her think she doesn't because becoming a better person is what will make her happy. And it's the role she needs to play to help make others happy in the neighborhood.

Remember when Bernie Sanders was invited to the Vatican to speak on the urgency of injecting morality into the world economy? This is the bottom up application of that from the inside out because it is hard to force someone to be good. This is our responsibility, our part in the revolution, to be masters of ourselves. The meritocracy rewards those who excel in either an area expertise or marketing those skills but does not care how we do that. People are judging how much the ends justify the means from a very bias personal position. This meritocracy does not reward merit, rather it rewards exchanging merit for money. Other areas, including morals, are being neglected for that purpose. Let's pay ethics the attention they are due.  Let's be civil and see how it works out into civics and our civilization.  
~  
It's like how a private school in an area will utilize the best teachers, resources, and some of the brighter kids that would have otherwise been helping the public schools. The rewards for other areas are not as subsidized and they atrophy, operating on a break-fix mentality that tends to hollow us out until we are a house of cards. Family has biological drive going for it and it's hard to beat love as a motivator, art has legacy for ego, but in general society's energy and resources are concentrated into financial merit. That's probably because money is seen as a representation of skill, effort, and time. It's not that we started out taking from other areas, such as personal character, it's that we paid them lip service and then after a while, basically ignored them.  
~  
There is a real decline in religious affiliation, and I think that we as a culture may be inadvertently getting rid of too much along with it such as community and morals. Morals are not an opt in position, they happen if we tend to them or not. We can put effort into them and reap the benefit; We might as well make this bed, because no one else is going to do it and we have to sleep in it.  We, in general, have dismissed a lot of regular time and energy that used to be put into such endeavors with the decline of religion as a cultural institution (sociologically). Too much focus on boundaries can be fixating and there is a lot to be said for tea, a hike, and a good book, but it's not how we used to run things. It's how the culture was balanced. Now there is a loud silence when it comes to talking about fairness and kindness. There is something being lost in transition. I'm not arguing how effective religion was and is at attending to society's morality, nor how ethical individuals are able to do for themselves. But tv, movies, music, and the books studied in school are apparently not up to the challenge of the dog-eat-dog mentality. It is the drive of western cultural ambition that has lead to great leaps and bound for health and science, but we dismiss the downside at our peril.  
~  
Technological advancement is unbelievably powerful in both beneficial and detrimental ways. Fertilizer exploded both food production and, by way of fostering survival, demand. The earth is not 'supposed' to have highways, but few laments the creation of motorized vehicles. The internet is literaturarily awesome, however it shapes us as much as we shape it. The big counter example would be the printing press, codifying our ideas may have accelerated their competition for human thought space, but we have been in conflict with each other way since time immemorial. I hope the internet (and its' cellular capability) to be like the printing press and not the auto. There is a lot of shirts online, but that fertilizer creates the chaos for order to emerge from, an excuse to get out of our cells and come together in interest. Remember all the stuff we had to stop doing because we found out how bad they were for us? How great would it have been to not start doing those things in the first place? I'm saying we stop politely ignoring that there may be a downside before people forget how to be polite, not individuals that already know, but in generations to come.   
~  
The bad doesn't take away from the good nor the good from the bad. There are acceptable ways to act even in the worst human societies, but whether it's chicken or egg, there are beneficial ways of acting that only exist in civil societies. Starting interactions with the intention of goodwill for example creates an environment that fosters our communities.  
~  
Humanity experiences in one second more life then any individual will in their lifetime. That vitality produces a wealth of potential. The problem comes when people start to borrow, sacrifice, and take the energy from developing their character to concentrate on getting ahead individually. We need to take a longer look than our retirements, but more than that we need to take the blinders off and share the experience with others. Why not come in second or forth, or fifty third, with a community around you? Speaking of company, companies sometimes attend to this in a reflection of how much the people that generate their wealth care about it. The Good Place, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are two examples of how our corporate intuitions are trying to help us to eat our vegetables and fill the void. And of course charities are our emergent altruism. Altruism and love are, in fact, self-interested drives. Great ones at that!. They help us improve our environment for the greater good. I can feel the desire in the zeitgeist for the health of our communities. It allows us to pursue endeavors in the environment they provide, including financial merit.  
~  
Human activity scales. We act more maturely but in the same ways when we are five years old that we do in the rest of our lives and we could use options for external correction. Self oversight has been known to be a issue in our intuitions and in some ways we all fight a battle against personal corruption. We also scale in that how we act inwardly is reflected in how we act outwardly (and vice versa) our personal circles, our communities, our nations, and indeed humanity is patterned how the sum of the parts individually act. It appears the mental health of our culture is a bit stigmatized and neglected. I'd be content if morals replaced religion alongside money and politics as something we don't talk about. That way it would at least be in our mindset.  
~  
So in that spirit, what ideas do you have for fostering 'artisanal' (vs corporate) ethics in our communities? Not what morals, but rather how to integrate them into our lives. We are all in this together, and how we treat each other can either make it seem like an ascending elevator or a park. I want the park to be seen as a valid option, so that we can find a balance between the two. It's not us verses each other, it's us verses the problems.

1) The Others - from the very start they make it very clear that this place is meant for only the best of the best kinds of people who, to keep things short, for the most part did all they can do bring good to the world. Which is great and all but they refuse to talk about 'the others' the people who never fought world hunger, tried to save a struggling nation, developed some life saving drug or device, the average people who lived decent human lives are simply shafted. From that point alone I knew something can't be right, not everyone can be that perfect and as we saw from Chidi and Tahini not even them were that great as Chidi spent his life working on a book that was supposed to be for the better but In the end not even Michale could figure out what he was talking about. Which comes off to me almost as wasted time as for all we know he could have been thinking complete rubbish and the opposite of what he was going for. Meanwhile Tehani grew up in the shadow of her sister, at least from her  parents. I would think all these great things she's done was simply out of spite a way to prove to her self, her sister, and her parents that she's better and everyone should pay attention to her.  

2) Tehani - Falling off where I left off, it bothers me to have the idea that all she's good for is trying to show that she can be better, richer, nicer, and simpler more popular than everyone else. Even in this ""after life"" she still acts like she's this wonderful, glamorous girl who everyone loves and adores. Volunteering to clean up the neighborhood, going door to door talking to the neighbor's to feel like she ""belongs hers"". Her entire persona just comes off fake. Also why does she still have her English accent? Everyone comes from across the world and they all speak different languages, for example Chidi is supposedly speaking French and we just hear everything through what the other can understand in this case English (American) for Eleanor.  At the party we saw and heard several different people, supposedly all from different countries and we heard them speak fairly with an a American accent all except for Tehani. I thought since its still English she might have gotten a pass but why hasn't anyone else we seen have another?  

3) Soulmates -  How are soulmates calculated and if you died married and get paired with somebody else would that mean that person you could have been married to for say 40 years wasn't your soulmate after all? When I think about this none of the known parings add up.  You have Eleanor and Chidi, one who's a rude, disrespectful, and couldn't care about anyone feelings but her own and the other is a grad who over works himself trying to this perfectly nice and intelligent guy. Then and Tehani and Jianyu (Jason), Tehani grew up with all the big things in life being from a wealthy family and she loves to talk a lot meanwhile her soulmate is presented to be a monk who doesn't say anything (who in actually is a vandalizing wanna be DJ) . The two of them clearly don't belong together, Eleanor and Chidi are are different pages many times and Tehani almost broke by the fact Jianyu not speaking to her ever.  There is still no explanation to what about those who been married for generations. 

Edit : I later thought what if they're meant to be opposite, like this is supposed to be an opposite attraction type deal like Tehani helps Jianyu be more open to the world now that he's not really on it anymore and he helps her stop trying to focus on being so perfect and just relax and enjoy the comfort of your own self minding. While Eleanor helps Chidi stop trying to be Mr . Perfect and right with the world and he helps her to think about others for once becoming a nicer person without needing to change all of who she  since as we can see she's becoming a lot more knowing of the feelings of those around her and not leaving them to dry as she would living but she still hasn't completely changed her way of thinking. However, what debunks this the fact we don't know what the girl Eleanor's is posing as with her memories would be like with Chidi , for all we know they would get along great and Jason is nothing like what  Jianyu so who knows how Tehani could see him. She might think he's some  childish scrum and want nothing to do with him or she may find his way of living refreshing as it's another way to stop being so perfect. 

4)The database -  Janet is said to know just about everything there is to know,  in the pilot Eleanor asks Janet about an ex/guy she knew. Janet then goes over briefly who he was and how he felt about her. Weird thing is if Janet knew that then what happened that in her database if all says she loves clowns and favorite meal is nothing, and has done a bunch of things she never actually did?  

5)Death of age - everyone besides Michael is shown to be relatively young, I know there's different neighborhoods for everyone and this one is somewhat new (how new we I don't know could be many years) but I will assume they will be at least 1 older person 40s at least who can be there as some kind of guidance  and besides for Eleanor we don't really know how these people died. When you consider all these great things they have done seems ironic they'll just suddenly die at young age. 

6)The rest of the land - in one episode Chidi is advised to go explore as Michael tells him there's more out there just beyond where they stand and he wants Chidi to discover it as supposedly they have no idea.  While how cool that will be to venture out and see what else the place offers, shouldn't Michale have some idea of what's else is out there? He says this neighborhood is his first but hasn't he seen others and had a mentor or something teaching him and showing him what's currently out there and of Janet is supposed to know all why doesn't she say anything ? At the very least I'd expect Michale to have already read a book about the place as he's read just about everything else there is . ",3,5,False,self,,,,,

We also see that Jianyu is second-from-the-top. 

If you imagine a tournament bracket, they'd be paired up. If you extend this logic, knowing that Eleanor is sixth-from-the-top, it's possible that Chidi is sixth-from-the-bottom. And perhaps the pairs continue on in that way.

So ... we know Eleanor was pretty bad while she was alive, but we absolutely know for certain that Jianyu was worse. I mean, she can at least string rational thoughts together. If the list is really a ranking system, it's possible that it is ranking in order of worst to first. And since Jianyu is in second place, that would mean that whoever is in first place on that list must be an absolute disaster of a (former) human being.

Does anyone have a screenshot of the list? Can we see if Chidi is sixth-from-the-bottom? And who is at the top? 

Anyway, let me know if you all think there may be something to this. And as a side note, I'm so happy I found this subreddit! I absolutely love the show.

EDIT: Never mind to all of this. Someone posted a screenshot of the list in a previous thread and you can clearly see that Chidi is ranked 15th.

Also you have to keep in mind that people from the Bad Place aren't honest.  It is possible that this second Eleanor is an impostor as well.  A ploy being used by the people from the Bad Place to get what they want.  

If this second Eleanor is false I think the one who may notice is Jianyu/Jason.  He is from a less than reputable background like Eleanor.
