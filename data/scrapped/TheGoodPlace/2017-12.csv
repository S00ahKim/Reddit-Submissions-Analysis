I hope there is an episode that at least briefly shows how the Janets are made.

My theory is that the engineers/makers of Janet have to make a certain quota amount of Janets and each engineer's Janets are marked with specific serial numbers or marks. The Good Place engineer of the Janet we see on the show somehow tracks her down and is upset that the Janet he or she created  is being used in the Bad Place and that she has gained the ability to lie. In flashbacks we see the engineers building and setting up the programs within the Janets. Our Janet's engineer talks to his or her creation(pre-activation) about serving Good Place neighbhoorhoods kind of like the opening scenes of Edward Scissorhands where the creator talks to Edward.

 We then see some another flashback showing The Good Place realizing that a Janet has gone missing. Janet's engineer tries to find her, but maybe stops for a long time and then decides resume the search for her which leads to the Bad Place and he or she finds the serial number or mark. The engineer tries to take Janet back to ""reform"" her and Michael fights for Janet. ",5,13,False,self,,,,,

He then suggests that they work together in the name of unit cohesion.

Those two terms  insubordination and unit cohesion  surprised me, in terms of Michaels vocabulary. I havent watched the episode for a while, but I remember being surprised by that language. It makes perfect sense grammatically... and yet, its so obviously out of place.

Im not saying Michael is dumb or doesnt have an ordinarily great vocabulary. Eleanor displays a similar kind of suddenly amazing vocabulary (like when she said Jason smoked a big bowl of ennui); its just out of place for Eleanor to know a word like ennui, although she may have got it from Chidi.

My long shot theory is that Michael has been through the process of making a Place before. S1 shocked us all by spinning one basic premise: why not spin the premise that this isnt the first Place invented by Michael? Its as if he suffered through a whole other series of reboots / a Good Place Vicky we havent seen with different characters (perhaps those we meet in S2 in The Real Good Place) and eventually found the precise terminology to describe it, perhaps from Shaun as a high-ruling, all-knowing judge. (Apologies about the run-on sentence there!)

Conclusion from this part: the people we meet in The Real Good Place could well be in on whatever torture plan Michael has concocted and this has been a long haul for him. Its all still torture and a deep mind game.

Think also about Michaels age. He said hes been there since the beginning of time, like all of it. Does it take that long to design torture plans yourself? Flattening the male genitals isnt exactly ingenious or creative and other demons, like Chris (the guy that takes off his shirt, gym guy), dont seem to be very smart. Why would it take so long to come up with some dumb ideas? Granted, demons are not architects - but theyre working closely together doing approximately similar things, so the gap isnt realistically that wide.

Also think about who told Michael he could start working: a young man with black  not gray  hair. Someone seemingly much younger than Michael, who would logically be in a less senior position, spoke to Michael almost as if he were his superior. It suggests that Michael was a Good Place architect that was disillusioned or bored and decided to re-train to learn how to torture people, and therefore he aged a bit more compared to the younger people that just set out to torture people from day one.

It would also explain how Michael got a Good Place Janet; although there may be no access code to the factory where Janets were made, Michael knew how to access the pocket dimension. It sounds as if there are infinitely many pocket dimensions, but knowing the specific one requires special knowledge  too difficult to access by random guessing and therefore resulting from prior, acquired knowledge. Like precise coordinates.

This is such a long-shot theory with not much evidence to it. Im sure you could argue the contrary and so on. I had a wave of ideas and so just wrote this very quickly. Sorry about the poor structure!",3,9,False,self,,,,,
