It had no real free will and was programmed to do whatever humans wanted and it acted as a slave. Despite the protests by Eleanor, Tahani, and Michael, Jason used Janet in ways that Janet was not built or designed for. He had a fake wedding and spent most of the time trying to have sex with Janet. He showed no care organized respect for  Janet. He  continued to call Janet a girl, when it isn't, called Michael Janet's father, when Michael isn't, and had a one side relationship where he never gave Janet anything and never did something just for Janet. Unlike his much more loving behavior with tahani, either Janet he didn't listen to or respect it.

In some ways, he showed almost every bad quality possible in a relationship. When Janet was still developing after the reboot and not adult, he sexualized it and from then on- like a child's victim to sexual abuse - it developed a glitch for the rest of its lifetime with Jason's actions profoundly affecting it's life and causing sexual problems. Janet developed a sort of addiction making up virtual porn for itself involving him and such.

In many ways, Janet is like a transsexual who Jason continually refers to using the gender before a sex change. In other ways, Janet is like a slave before the Civil War raped by an owner. In other ways Janet and Jason symbolize love of things over the people.

The writers have done a great job of showing how selfish some people are and how much they are willing to hurt others. Jason is a human being. Janet is a computer program designed to serve humans. As Janet is evolving from lacking free will to having it. As it is evolving from lacking social skills to gaining them. As it is moving from just an ai interface for material goods, to something developing desires of its own, it is very much representing the move from a young child to a teenager. The damage to its happiness from Jason's abuse is becoming very obvious. 

What is clear is how powerful the writing is. It shows so clearly the pain and suffering Janet's goes through while Jason does not even remember it. When they were fake married, Jason was consumed almost completely it finding a way to have sex with Janet as he did not accept Janet for what it was but wanted to feminize it.

Jason never thought about the harm he was doing doing to Janet despite being told clearly by Michael that this wasn't right.

Janet at one time point asked Michael to kill it because of  Jason. It was wanted to be a normal Janet, but there damage Jason did was making it glitch and unable to do its job. Janet wasn't doing upset, emotional, suicidal, and hurt from Jason's trying to make Janet into the a woman and haven't her, instead of Jim respecting her and caring for her as a she is. 

I really hope that people can learn from this show and be more thought and caring to others. To realize that sex abuse of children can really hurt them for life.

I also hope that Janet finds a way to get better and move away from its Jason problem and find a way to either be a happy by itself our finds a different being to love. It deserves the respect, compassion, acceptance, and caring that you Jason never showed it, and it deserves to do better than a relationship with someone who refuses to listen or accept it for what it is.

I realize that some people want to ship Jason and Janet. Why? Jason wants sex and it is not built that's way. Also, Jason has treated Janet very poorly. He picked flowers and got a poster for tahani. He helped tahani with her party planning and showed her real generosity. For Janet, Jason was very happy clear that he liked it getting him material possessions. Whenever he showed any interest in Janet, it was seeing it as an female and liking free stuff. But Janet is not female, and the only real thing he likes about Janet is free stuff there is nothing about what makes Janet unique from other Janets that Jason likes. There is nothing ab Jason besides Jim showing interest that Janet likes about him. Jason continually annoys it and it corrects him over and over ab basic things like that she isn't a good woman. Who here would really date a guy who routinely said you were a different gender than you are over and over in public?  Who would date someone who spend days publicly talking about how you are unable to sexually satisfy him?

Let's face it, a man who talks to all your friends about how you can not sexually satisfy him. Who calls you a different gender repeatedly. Who regularly asks you to get him stuff, while never giving you anything. Who when you say you are in love with him, does not even spend 15 minutes talking with you about it and  apologizes your him girlfriend about having been interested in you with the defense of not remembering you (pretty obvious analogy of a drinking hookup and arguing she did mean anything). Who shows how meaningless how fakes marriage to you is by proposing to someone else in a reboot almost immediately after starting a relationship and gets married  in real life plutonically. Someone who watches as your thumb floats away and you have serious health and mental health issues and never offers even to listen to you or help. I do not get the Jason and tahani shipping. Especially given how well the writers have used their relationship to shine a light into abusive and unhealthy relationships.

Finally, no one has to read or agree with me, but please no internet abuse and no trolling. I have read a small number of mean posts attacking people and that isn't nice.  Everyone here is a human being, so I if you would not want someone to say something to you, please don't say it to them. Thx. ",15,1,False,self,,,,,

If the representative of the Good Place is real in this scenario, that is, and not just another demon trying to manipulate hapless souls in the afterlife. Beadie (the Good Place representative) did say something along the lines of: we've tried to get you - to Mindy, but they didn't. Why? Is it because the Judge intervened? The Bad Place demons are powerful enough to get what they want? This would mean the Good Place representatives respect the Judge's rulings (along with the demons, but for entirely different reasons - as we saw, Trevor was brushed off into oblivion by the Judge), aren't that powerful, give up easily, or they just don't care about the souls that much.

 How does the staff of the afterlife take care of increasing population?  Have they had staff that didn't do anything for aeons just waiting for something to do?

In much the same way one would ask ""As the population of the earth increases exponentially, how does one man deliver all those presents"" people have suggested that Santa can manipulate and slow down time.  I suggest the answer is similar for the afterlife - the Santa effect.

As more people die, time slows down so they can be processed.  The judge is closer to our reality so her time is closer if not in sync to our time line so while hundreds of years have passed for our team in the bad place, only a small amount has passed for the judge.  Hence why it has only been 30 years since her last case and why she is watching NCIS. 

This also makes sense for the doorway Shawn created. The demons were actually in that room for decades and it took a long time for them to construct it.

I do think time also flows differently for neighborhoods and the offices but I haven't fully grocked that.

We didn't know, though.

So when Sean and Michael are in the bedroom, when Eleanor figures out they are in the Bad Place, why did Shawn say that Michael will probably be retired for this mess?

It was completely broken. I mean that each of the 4 tests was broken. Including Eleanor's.

* Chidi : This test seems to be the most popular to call out. How was Chidi supposed to know? Chidi's problem isn't his inability to make decisions, but how this inability a) Led him to a life of inaction and b) Hurt everybody close to him. His test just doesn't really grade his improvement in these areas.

 * The only way he could hurt his friends with this test was if he failed it. Chidi had no reason to conclude that the right answer was to choose quickly, but had all the reasons to believe that he shouldn't choose wrong. And that means that a Good Chidi would have all the more reason to be nervous and hesitate in choosing. Maybe there's a cut scene in which Gen tells him that he needs to pick as soon as possible to pass or something like that, but in the state this test was presented it doesn't make any sense.
 * Here's a more effective test: Make him believe that he passed the test and give him the chance of helping his friends one by one with their tests (and possibly those 'friends' are fakes doing fake tests). Pre-death Chidi would most likely spend the totality of the test trying to make the right choice in who to help. Improved Chidi would just pick one friend ASAP and figure out a way to help everyone.

* Tahani :  I think the test was actually very good, but I don't think she failed it. She opened the door to speak with her parents. But just notice that she seems to have done it to just have a serious talk with them and let them go. 

* Jason : The problem with this test is that he isn't very smart, and Gen should know this. And yet this test required him to make a very smart analysis of what Gen asked him to do. Realize that if losing the game means losing the test, he doesn't have to play the game. But I just don't think this shows he has poor impulse control. It looks like all it does is show he doesn't analyze things correctly? Is not being a genius something that gives you negative points? 

* Eleanor : Eleanor's test has exactly the same problem as Jason's. It mostly tested not her self-lessness but her wit. It's not completely clear she made her decisions because she's less self-less or because she figured out the test was a trick.

 * A better test would have been to not include fake Chidi in the test. Start showing her the rest of her friends struggling with their tests and make her decide to leave them or stay. But even in this case, Eleanor could have figured out.",16,1,False,self,,,,,

They had an amazing thing going on, and it would have been easy to just stick with the format that made the show successful but no, they took the risk and it paid off so so much.

In a small conversation between Michael, Eleanor and Chidi about Les Miserables Michael mentions that all French people go to the bad place (Which if true is much worse than what I'm suggesting). In Les Miserables a man steals bread to feed his family and Michael said that he knows that the man is in the bad place (could be because he is French though and not because of stealing bread) and that stealing bread reduces a certain amount of points. This suggests 2 things, either the man was sent to the bad place strictly because he was French (Yep the system is broke) or that good intentions dont counteract bad actions. I.e. the man stole bread to feed his family which should be worth a whole lot of points for him, however the conversation suggests he lost points. 

What I am saying is that the system is broke because even if you have good intentions and end up saving a lot of people it is all meaningless if a bad action was performed.  I'm sure someone could kill a suicide bomber and end up losing points instead of gaining a lot from saving somebody.

(I wish there were a GIF of it or something, but since its a new movie still in the theaters, probably not).  I was also thinking about how Eleanor does the same thing in the flashbacks of right before she died.

Come to think of it, The Grinch isnt all that different than Team Cockroach.  They all have a troubled past that, while it doesnt excuse their actions, certainly contextualizes and explains them.  The Grinch has certainly done more than enough bad things to land him in the Bad Place, but like our four, in the end he is not beyond redemption.

Now initially I took this as Shawn trying to mess with Michael saying how his idol and former possible template for humanity was doomed to the Bad Place and not true. What if it is true though?

At times in the series weve heard reference to trials before the judge. Namely that in season one Eleanors trial to stay in the good place was number 3. As Michael said if I recall correctly he tried to keep close to the truth initially to help keep up the lie (a good lie is close to the truth). The trial number could be conceptually the third trial the judge overheard. If the judge has only heard three trials one of them obviously being Mindy St. Claire what if the other was Doug Forcett.

I know that Dougs vision was only ~90% accurate (kinda forgot the exact number) but what if the Bad Place argued it was too close and pushed for the judge to make a ruling and she decided he was aiming for moral desert and stopped his points count there and for whatever reason this knowledge is left to only senior staff which is why Michael wouldnt know if this is true.

My main reason for the ability to dispute is based on Id guess based of the video for the Medium Place Mindy was going to the Bad Place but the Good Place intervened and while they didnt win neither did the Bad Place. Now why shes known about and Dougs fate is not is because the Medium Place has to exist since the dispute happened when she died while Doug is still alive. 

Only thing Im realizing is under what I proposed it would almost seem like Doug could deserve a Medium Place because the judge wouldnt be certain how to rule because of his vision. 

TL:DR Shawn knew Doug Forcett is going to the Bad Place because the judge decided his vision was too right and he is searching for moral desert.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Now that hes all caught up and Ive watched the whole thing through like 6 times, I do have a few questions and also some things I noticed.

1)if the judge can do things like absorb the entirety of peoples existences, why did she even need to test them? Couldnt she look into their soul he figure it out or something otherworldly and all powerful like that?

2)the worst episode of the show is Chidis Choice, because it comes dangerously close to revealing Michaels true nature way too early (hes sort of mean in this episode) and at the same time, it seems like absolute filler when Tahani and Eleanor both confess their love for Chidi, make him choose the whole episode and then they both take it back. The second worst episode and the only other bad episode in the whole show is A Fractured Inheritance because both plots were way too forced and easy to predict, plus we knew the issue with Tahani and her sister since the beginning, it wasnt a huge reveal or anything.

3)Doug Forcett is going to the bad place not just because hes seeking moral dessert, but because his motivations are also insanely corrupted. His only reasoning for being the way he is that he tells Michael and Janet is because he wants to maximize his point total, not because he wants to be good.

4)There is so much foreshadowing its honestly scary. Chidi thinks that you meet people by them walking into your office and asks to learn about philosophy and thats exactly how Eleanor introduces herself when shes brought back to Earth. Other specifics escape me right now because its 2:30 in the morning, but you get it

5)When did Michael ever mention that there was an actual all knowing judge of everything in the afterlife and that Shaun wasnt it? They just bring it up out of nowhere when they decide to go to the judge at the middle of season 2, so when did he ever actually mention it?

6)I have not adopted the way of saying fork and shirt instead of other words, but I have adopted calling people man because of Eleanor

7)My brothers nickname is Jeremy Bearimy and also that sequence is one of the best points in the show. The way Chidi asks then what the hell is that?! Cracks me up every time

8)Its starting to get a little sad to see Michael not get rebooted and be the one whos made the most moral progress and have to keep rebooting his friends over and over again even though hes probably become the best him he could be and they keep going back and forth between good and bad. 

9)Are there any theories about what Shaun May have said about what else he was certain about at the end of the newest episode? I know it was the bigger thing of Michael to do to kick him through a portal, but at the same time I really wanted to know what he would say

10)the best episode of the show is the worst possible use of free will because it finally explains the I love you reboot and then spices up the main plot line by asking really interesting and seemingly insolvable philosophical questions and discussing them in further detail while also getting a clip show of new footage. Brilliant stuff.

It never fails to make make me laugh, and I find it really wholesome compared to other comedies. I don't know if this has already been discussed here but one thing I've noticed is the similarities between the four humans and Jesus (That guy from the Bible). They have similar arcs and motivations. 

Jesus is quoted as ""dying for humanity's sins"", and while his death is a sacrifice unlike Jason, Tahani, Chidi, and Eleanor there are still parallels. The four humans each died for their sins (Tahani's insecurity leads her to attack the statue of her sister, Eleanor chewing out the environmentalist delays her and puts her in the path of the shopping carts, Jason's penchant for crime has him suffocate in a safe, and Chidi's hesitation is why he is standing underneath the falling AC unit). Each of the humans worst characteristic is what kills them.  Death as a result of sins is a prevalent theme. 

Upon death the person is sent to hell/the bad place. Jesus and the four wrestle with the evil down there and eventually come back to life. Jesus' sacrifice was to clear all sins and once the four return to life, they make it their goal to help others reach the good place. 

Before Jesus' sacrifice Heaven was closed off. The evil would go to hell, but even the ""good"" people would not make it to Heaven, instead they were sent to a purgatory or medium place. After the sacrifice the doors are opened and Jesus returns to Heaven.

Sean's comment that even Doug would not make it to the Good Place has started speculation that reaching the Good Place is extremely restrictive/unreachable. Now the group has left the world in an attempt to understand/fix the restrictive nature of the Good Place. 

I don't have a great knowledge about Christianity, most of my information comes from Sunday school over a decade ago. I'm not suggesting that the four's journey will continue to reflect that of the Bible (Bible spoilers: everyone dies), but it is interesting to see the parallels. Let me know what you think or tell me to fork off.

In Michaels orientation video in first episode, the one woman that supposedly earned enough points to go to the good place had: 999276 points by the time she died.  

Assume an average person lives for 70 years, 

999276 /70 years = 14275 points per year

14275/365 days = 39 points a day.

To get 40 points a day, you can start from small good acts: 
eat a sandwich +1 pt
Pet a lamb + 1 pt 
Hug sad friend +3 pts
Fix broken tricycle for child who is indifferent to tricycles + 7 pts 
There are many more point items that exist we dont know. 

Assume that you are kind to the world around you everyday, you should be able to get 20-40 day.

And you get a couple a big point items once a while:

Purify water for a village: 293(?) pts 
Remain loyal to Cleveland Browns: 50 pts 

Also of courses avoid the negative acts like genocide (-435185 pts) or ruin opera (-83pts) 

And BAM! You are there! Its not easy, but still doable. 

I know I know, Michael is a demon and the orientation video is a lie and so the information about the point system is probably off too. 

Just wanted to do the math. Gosh it is not easy being a consistently good person for 70 years. So maybe only the top 5% of the humans ever lived are in the good place?

And some changes around the sub,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a3p6hk/meta_new_episode_tonight_s4_confirmed_and_some/,WandersFar,1544111935,"Greetings fellow cockroaches,

First off, **there will be a new episode TONIGHT** beginning at the usual time, **8:30pm** Eastern Standard Clock Land. This is the last episode before the show goes on hiatus until the new year.

Second, ***the show has been renewed for a fourth season!*** This decision was announced early (*before* the mid-season hiatus) which is a good sign. The show was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Comedy, and Kristen Bell is up for Best Actress.

Lastly, thanks for weighing in on [the meta thread](https://redd.it/9x4cns) that was pinned over the last few weeks. These changes have been made in response to your feedback:

#New Spoiler Policy

(This is a soft rollout, u/AutoModerator wont start removing threads for a few days to give everyone time to adjust to the new rule.)

All titles must **BEGIN** with a **SEASON NUMBER** at minimum. **An episode number is optional, but encouraged.** Some examples:

##S1E1 My TGP fan art.

S1E1 is effectively no spoilers. It assumes youve only seen the pilot. Comments referencing any other episode should be covered `&gt;!with a spoiler tag!&lt;` &gt;!that will appear like this.!&lt;

##S2E3 Something I noticed in this episode.

Likewise, if the title says S2E3, then you can talk about anything *up to that episode* in the comments. Anything past that should be covered with a spoiler tag.

##S3 Speculation on upcoming episode titles.

If your topic spans multiple episodes then its appropriate to tag just for the season. But avoid doing this if possible, be as specific as you can.

* As before, no spoiling information is allowed in titles. (The one exception is the S1 finale twist, which has been fair game for a while.)

* And also as before, any thread about the current season will be marked as Spoilers. (The only difference is now u/AutoModerator can do that job automatically, instead of the mods having to flag each thread manually. : Less work for us, safer front page for you. Win-win.)

**TL;DR:** No Spoilers = **S1E1.** Spoilers Everything = the number of the current season, **S3.** And of course you can mark for any episode in between. Use `&gt;!spoiler tags!&lt;` in comment threads when appropriate.

___

#New Shirtpost Flair

The sub seemed somewhat split on shirtposts. Many of you love them, but some of you really hate them.

So theyll continue to be welcome here, **so long as theyre flaired.** When submitting a shirtpost, please disclose it as a shirtpost so those who dont want to see them can filter them out. And if you see an obvious shirtpost, report it so u/AutoModerator can flair it.

If you dont want to see shirtposts, click the **No Shirtposts** link in the sidebar. Its the first link under **Filters**.

___

#Fun Stuff

##Special Treat

We have something in the works that I am ***very excited*** about. I dont want to give anything away, so Ill just give a shout-out to our two new mods, u/BioregenerativeLamp &amp; u/theEnzyteGuy. Coding geniuses, both of them.

##Episode Countdown Timer

u/BioregenerativeLamp is also responsible for the episode countdown timer in the sidebar that will let you know when a new episode is debuting. No more checking schedules!

##Upvotes &amp; Downvotes

As requested, upvotes and downvotes now match the graphics from Michaels intro vid. The hover texts reference various episodes.

##Curly Blockquotes

I gave blockquotes a makeover. They now have a colored background and big curly quotes on either side so they pop against the rest of your text.

##Cockroach Rainbow

Theres also a new cockroach rainbow in the sidebar. It cycles through headshots of the team as you scroll down a page. And the base background is no longer a flat gold, theres now a subtle radial gradient to match the header.

##New User Flairs

The flair selector has been cleaned up a bit. The hover text now displays at the top of the pop-up so you can preview the text before you apply it.

And of course there are some new flairs. The most recent additions are the black-and-white clown door from Eleanors house, Nightmare George Washington and Jasons BOOBS statue. I also added the heaven pets a while back if you missed them. As always, if you have an idea for a new flair, just ask. Tag my username so I see it.",95,1,False,self,,,,,

I have two major theories about why that is.

1. I guess the ""standard theory"" is that Doug's motivations are impure. This would be a problem for, for example, Kant -- who is a deontologist, even though the ""points"" system seems to be a utilitarian one. I think this one is pretty likely.
2. Doug isn't actually ""selfless"" or a utilitarian optimizer. He could be called a ""happiness pump,"" but unlike a utilitarian, he seems to accept more unhappiness for himself than he gives out. He might be best described as an [ascetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism), or a person who abstains from pleasure for some sort of spiritual benefit. This theory would allow them to explore the moral teachings of the show a little more directly.
3. Doug is a good person, making the world around him better and earning points, but he hasn't earned *enough* points. The first episode frames the good place as something only the best of the best get. So Doug, although good, is somehow still not good enough to avoid an eternity of torture. This theory would work well in the context of the plot to reform the good place, and add a medium place, as it would drive the cast to explore why the universe is set up as it is.",17,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

These seem like huge red flags that Jason might not have the capacity to consent to sex.** 

He doesn't understand simple biological concepts like a person needing air to breathe (which is how he died) and doesn't seem to know or understand he is clearly lactose intolerant despite the repeated diarrhoea - so does he understand contraception or how someone gets pregnant? Does he have the ability to understand that? If you sat him down and explained the reproductive system and the consequences of sex and pregnancy to what extent would he be able to understand it? If he doesn't understand that sex can lead to pregnancy (under normal circumstances anyway) then by most standards that alone would exclude him from being considered capable to consent to sex.

It's shown he can write simple sentences (his notes to Eleanor weren't well expressed but the second one at least was clear about what he wanted to say) but we're never shown how thoroughly he understood the philosophy classes he was in - if he understood anything. To be considered learning disabled he would usually have to have an IQ under 50. There is a real chance he would meet that requirement. 

&amp;#x200B;

So lets look at his and Tehani's relationship. 

Tehani is an intelligent, eloquent person in full control of her faculties and Jason trusts her to guide him right (like teaching him not to eat candles). She is very much in a position of power in this situation and is aware of it as evidenced by her doubts about going public about their relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Or Jason and Janet

He decides he's in love with her because she brings him things and is nice to him.

 Does he understand what love is? 

He decides to marry her on a whim. 

Does he understand what marriage IS? Does he have the capacity to make a commitment like that? 

There is a complicated power dynamic in that relationship too - she is recovering from a massive trauma and has lost huge amounts of her knowledge. This means that for once HE has the opportunity to shape HER view of the world, of him and of relationships to match him and his needs. However he can't communicate those needs to her (as evidenced by their failure to figure out how to have sex). She can bring him anything he wants but he can't understand, express or understand the consequences of those wants. There are questions to be asked about what level of independent agency Janet has. She is programmed to make humans happy - is her 'love' for Jason just a manifestation of that programming? This does intersect with Eleanor's questioning about whether her love for Chidi was genuine or manipulated into existence by Micheal. To what extent might Janet's 'love' for Jason be a quirk in programming triggered by a requirement to please humans rather than a genuine response to his character and their interactions? 

Compare to Eleanor - her favourite book might be Kendall Jenner's instagram but she CAN reason at a higher level. She makes deductive leaps in figuring out they are in the Bad Place, reads and applies the philosophy books on the curriculum to their real life situations, falls in love with Chidi based on their mutual connection over a long period of close contact and bonding over classes and conversation with a romantic gesture of him skipping flying like an owl being the reason she finally falls for him completely and makes her move. She understand the consequences of her actions even if she ignores that knowledge. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does Jason have that ability?

&amp;#x200B;

So if he doesn't have the capacity to consent to sex then is it really ethical to be having sex with him?

Like everyone who is obsessed with this show, I went to look up to deaths that year to see who that might be. There is a list of 1497 deaths here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1497_deaths

One that stood out to me was Le Thanh Tong, a Vietnamese Emperor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%AA_Th%C3%A1nh_T%C3%B4ng

He:

-Gave women greater standing in society, at a time not known for being very feminist

-Gave daughters equal inheritance rights as their sons

-Made it so parental consent was no longer needed for marriage- imagine all the happiness this created when people could marry for love

-Fired corrupt officials and returned land that was illegally taken

-Was deeply concerned with being a good leader and high personal orality- the article calls him the ideal confucian leader

-Built temples of literature in all of his provinces

-Allowed villages to be run by their own councils

-landless peasants were given land that they had cleared

On the other hand, he may well have lost points from enslaving some of the people he captured in war and some of the nasty things done to them- although he did allow his captives to live which I guess was relatively merciful for him time and place.

Having the first thing they come across be the parent filter for swearing is a red flag. It's the forkin good place, why would they censer you when that's actually part of the torture in the bad place.


I had a theory from the previous episode that the gate of heaven are closed and the entire point system was designed to send EVERYONE to the bad place. Why? 


Reason one :-


Someone died in 1500 (the year they last had a good place entry) that changed the entire place and caused the good archs. to come up with impossible standards? 


Reason two:- 


An event happened that shifted the balance for humanity. I googled it and only two things came up for around that time. The middle age ends and we enter the modern age. The apocalypse was supposed to take place in 1500... apparently. Maybe the last guy stopped the apocalypse raising the standards.

Micheal lied to us. Lincoln is in the bad place! even ending slavery wasn't enough. Ok not a reason I just wanted to remind everyone that even though the screen capture clearly shows ending slavery as over 1.2 million points while the requirement for heaven was 1.1 mil he still didn't get in!

As everyone who's seen the show knows, Doug was the person who guessed 98% of the afterlife's details then decided to live the most rightous life he could so he could get into the good place. KEYWORD: !so he could get into the good place!  Technically, Doug is only being good for his personal gain after he dies. When Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason go back to Earth and are told about the afterlife by Michael, any good actions they do are immediately invalid because their motivation is now corrupt. Doug should be the same case.  Some might argue that Doug doesn't know for certain about the afterlife and this is why his good actions are still valid, but he seems pretty certain and when Michael suggests he loosen up a bit, he says he ""won't risk it"". He won't risk living normally because he could go to the bad place. While he seems like the perfect model for a good person, he is actually just worried about his own wellbeing in the afterlife. In the new episode ""Janet(s)"" we learn he has accumulated a large amount of points for being good so apparently his good actions are still being counted despite his supposedly corrupt intentions.

(Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a3z1ns/s3e10_proved_it_but_the_evidence_has_been_there/,stephensmat,1544182076,"Micheal's right. The Bad Place hacked the Points System; but the proof has been there from the start.

Micheal's whole turn from Demon to Pro-Human Advocate was based around the idea that these four humans became better people, but did so AFTER they died.

In one of the earliest episodes, Tahani was shown the 'Good Place points' as a form of torture, but Micheal made the point that that only applied to actions performed during life on Earth. 

And now that we know that NOBODY has gone to the Good Place, we have the proof. The whole point of an Afterlife is that you get to perform actions after your death; but The System doesn't recognize post-life actions? The System doesn't care about the dead, because once the Demons have you, they don't care about your personality.

The evidence: Mindy went nowhere.

Mindy St Clair is a disaster. But somehow, she broke even. How? Because the charity she dreamed up was only put into practise after her death. The points for post-life actions are not handled by The System properly; so Mindy couldn't go to The Good Place.

And why are the points not handled properly? Because the System isn't working like it should.

Eleanor said it herself, almost from episode one: ""This system sucks! One in a million get to go to the Good Place and the rest of us get tortured for eternity?""

Shaun tipped his hand *three times*. He demonstrated that he didn't care about the Rules when he sent a Strike Force to Mindy's in S2 (And then I remembered: I'm a naughty bitch""). He proved that the System could be hacked by creating his own Portal to Earth (He even had a whole room full of System-Hackers, totally at his mercy); and then he just had to gloat, in the last episode.

I've often thought that The System would be the key to an over-reaching arc. They've been nibbling around the edges of it since S2. I like the idea that we're heading towards an overhaul of the entire afterlife, where our heroes get put in charge of redesigning the Multiverse.

* **The printing press theory:** it was invented in the 1400s and by 1497 it had become operational throughout Europe. This allowed a lot of people to learn about ethics (amongst other things) and all moral philosophers (*however amateur*) are in The Bad Place.

* **Columbus theory #1:** When Columbus sailed to America he joined up the world, creating an interconnected civilisation across the globe. Unfortunately, that made everyone's negative actions affect millions more people, so that nobody could even do enough good to make up for it. You know that snide internet comment you wrote a while ago? It can be read by billions of people for hundreds of years and will make them all feel *slightly* worse.

* **Columbus theory #2:** When Columbus sailed to America he allowed technology and people to be spread globally starting a global Malthusian overpopulation crisis. Everyone born in an overpopulated world is losing points just by using the resources necessary to survive. They cannot do enough good to outweigh their participation in the extinction of the human race. Mindy St. Claire might have been able to solve this though, given that her foundation ""would help kids all over the world, advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and improve every nation and every society in every possible way.""

* **The obvious theory (Michael's theory):** The Bad Place hacked the points system to demand a higher points total than before. Or, the Bad Place kidnapped The Good Place mailroom guy, who should have been in that room they just landed in! In the latest episode we see a few accountants assigned to specific actions: Borrowing (Money), Impressions (Borat), Songs With Specific Dance Instructions, Stuffed Vegetables, American Coins, Weird Sex Things. Given the capricious nature of the points system, we can assume these all accrue negative points. If the system was hacked, was it hacked by the creating of a lot of negative actions while no new good actions are considered?

* **The dark theory:** The Good Place hacked the points system to demand a higher points total than before. This does bring into question why they fought for Mindy's inclusion recently. But Neil tells Michael that if he has a problem that he should ""Go to The Good Place and take it up with the committee!"". And why were there full sacks of points totals and a full tray of ""EXTREMELY IMPORTANT"" documents in The Good Place mailroom if they haven't had a new person in 521 years?

I thought maybe it would be 521 years before then. We'd be looking at [1495](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1495).   
  
When the Brainy Bunch were sent back to Earth, they went back to the moment they should have died, presumably 2016.  
IIRC they spend about a year separate before they meet in Australia, so 2017.
  
They spend about a year in Australia (again, IIRC), so bringing us to 2018.  
 
Is that right? Can we narrow the date ranges from dates on the show? Do any of the fake magazines have dates on them? I did a little bit of google-sleuthing, but didn't find any that were hi-res enough to see if they did.
  
  
Also, there's a lot of speculation about Columbus. Eleanor is born on 10/**13**/1982. Columbus Day is 10/**12** -  (Before US made holidays floating Mondays), based on first his arrival in the Bahamas in 1492. Is there a relation?

By the end of season two I was well versed in several philosophies, most particularly moral particularism which very well matched the way I live.

However.
One of my friends has been watching this show and on the flip side has turned into something between Doug Forcett and season 2 Michael on his own journey to become a paragon of virtue. He's constantly struggling with morality and the meaning of it all. Obviously we're supporting him but it's hard to see him struggle like this.

I guess I'm here to ask - has this show impacted you or anyone you know in the same way as me or my friend? 

And, does anybody have any good advice for dealing with somebody having an existential crisis?
With the themes this show deals with I figured maybe there's a few people here who have dealt with something similar.

Conflict means problems-- complications, puzzles to solve, emotions that aren't all positive to feel, decisions to be made.

I think that is what has actually happened to the characters on The Good Place. Tahani, Jason, Chidi, and even Eleanor were not \*that\* bad people. They all have very human flaws. None of them killed anybody or committed any kind of real atrocity. They were petty, vain, mean, self-centered... like a lot of people. But all of it comes from places of insecurity and vulnerability, not malice. So, what if that is enough for them to actually have gotten into The Good Place from the get-go but their story is then that they think they've really gotten into The Bad Place? They've essentially been in The Good Place from the start of the show but have been led to believe that isn't the case \*as part of\* their Good Place experience.

I think they just dont know, or they become complacent and never questioned the system. They are probably assured that good people keep getting in and they just live in different neighborhoods. 

Similarly, I dont think the good place staff (or angles) intentionally plot to keep people out. They just become too bureaucratic. People (like architects) are probably laid off(?) for the lack of incoming residents, and they just kept essential personnel who are probably sleeping the goos most of the time because they have nothing to do. Hence the abandoned mail room. 

I dont think the problem is good place people turning bad; the problem is the eternal beings in the good and bad place are so unfamiliar with actual human lives that they arent really invested in who or how many people get in. They dont really question the system and have become complacent. 

The bad place tampering with the scores might be a possibility, but I will bet my money on the rigidity of the score system becoming incompatible with modern life. So 520 years ago, Columbia discovered the new world. Then comes global colonization, expansion of capitalism, enslaving and killing native people, industrial revolution, pollution, inventions of cars/planes/bombs, world wars, global warming, etc. The problem is humans are consuming exponentially more resources and making more and more negative impact on earth that is hard to erase. Think about the amount of energy, resources and animals we consume everyday, and the amount of trash and carbon foot print we leave on earth. Also individuals are able to affect so many people around the globe in a unprecedented way. With weapons, wars can kill millions. With internet, one mean comment can hurt so many. So many more people are doing these things that cost huge negative points that no one can get in anymore. Remember Michael said something aboutexamining the resources it involves as one element in determining the point value for the weird sex thing? Resources wasted is definitely one of the factors. 

Also, people dont live long in the past. They might need fewer points to get in when they die at 30. If the points required for entering the good place increases with every additional year lived, no modern human beings can get in because with longer life, comes even higher point requirement. Hence Doug Foucet not getting in. 

My almost certainly wrong theory: the crew will talk to the angles in the good place, try to shake things up. They will have to convince the committee. They might have to go to the Supreme Court of the afterlife and meet God. They get temporary residence permits from the good place. The might be thrown back to the bad place anytime.

Abraham Lincoln is possibly in a medium place.

How did I come to this conclusion? 

Well, Michael memorably states that all presidents apart from Abraham Lincoln went to the bad place.
Abraham Lincoln died in 1865. 
In the latest episode it is established that the last person to enter the good place got there over 500 years ago. 
That means that the last person to enter the good place got there roughly 300 years before Abraham Lincoln died.

This directly tells us that if Michael was being honest about Abraham Lincoln then Abe went to a medium place because the criteria for the good place is truly too strict.

The nature of Mindy St. Clair's and Abraham Lincoln's good acts are even extremely similar, with both of them making changes that effected insane numbers of people globally, before dying immediately after solidifying a change in some way (beginning of Mindy's charity/surrender of Confederate army).

I know this show rarely puts these details in for no reason, so what do you think? Is it possible they're setting us up for more Abe Lincoln?

Let's discuss

We're told in S3EP9 that &gt;!nobody who died in the last five hundred years !&lt; is in the good place, therefore he's not in the good place.

We're also told in S3EP9 that our protagonists are the first people not to go directly to the afterlife after dying, therefore he's not floating around in some limbo.

""last person to get in was 500 years ago""

Ok you can probably guess where I'm going with this ? What if the problem is the life expectancy of humans being so high now, what if the points for the actions were given when you lived 30 years, and it gets increasingly difficult to get in the older you are.

The only hole in my theory is all the good people who died young. But maybe it still has to do with average life expectancy in the time period ?

Weve acknowledged that its become *incredibly* hard to get into the Good Place. Either because the Accountants dont account for point inflation, or because the Good Place made sure to restrain as much as possible its access (those are the two theories I like most, personally).

But then I thought about the Judges test in S2 and I dont know what to think of it. Eleanor passed the test, but it wasnt a worth-a-million-points action. I think it was more your average-good-person kind of pass. If the group hadn't decided to stick together, then, theoretically, Eleanor would've gone to the Good Place, right?

So I guess my question is: how does the Judge factor into all of this? She doesnt weigh in on a lot of cases (didnt she say she hadnt rendered a judgement in something like 300 years?), but being the All-Knowing-Judge, surely she knows *how much* of a good person youd have to be to get in the Good Place, and thus would either have given much more difficult tests? Or maybe shes so neutral and removed from the situation that she doesnt quite understand the points system  but if that were the case, it would irk me a bit, given that shes All-Knowing and has access to all the files.

&amp;#x200B;

It's no leap to guess that this coincides with an event on earth.  One that leads humans to fundamentally change in some manner of philosophical importance.  Perhaps an invention, discovery, religious uprising, etc.  I don't think the year has to match exactly though. Let's say the event is the publishing of the King James Bible 530 years ago, then there's a 9 year gestation period for humans to lose a ton of good points, or the folks in heaven to become snobs or total ashholes ala this [awesome theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a435mo/s3e10_spoilers_theory_the_episode_has_a_big/) from  [u/jaesin](https://www.reddit.com/user/jaesin) 

&amp;#x200B;

So some quick calculations:

2018 (is that the year the show is even in?)  minus 521 (is that right) = 1497

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting events around then:  

1456 - invention of printing press

1492 - davinci theorizes airplane

1492/1497 - america ""discovered"" bu columbus/amerigo vespucci

1494 - whiskey invented; death of philosopher Giovanni Pico 

1496 - invention of wallpaper

1611 - king james bible (my example above does not fit)

&amp;#x200B;

If I have the timeline right, this is falling smack into the Renaissance, and there's no way that can be a coincidence.   I know very little about this, but I feel like I know enough about The Good Place to know there's some serious philosophy coming our way.  Well, as serious as a sitcom can be about such things...  


This was supposed to be a short post.  But during the timeline search, I looked a bit more into this Giovanni Pico.  This dude, I've never heard of him, which means very little to his importance and relevance.  Apparently, he's quite influential. Here's a huge, boring quote from the ole wiki:

 

&gt;Importance of human quest for knowledge  
&gt;  
&gt;In the *Oration*, Pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a Neoplatonic framework. He writes that after God had created all creatures, He conceived of the desire for another sentient being who would appreciate all His works, but there was no longer any room in the [chain of being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_being); all the possible slots from angels to worms had been filled. So, God created man such that he had no specific slot in the chain. Instead, men were capable of learning from and imitating any existing creature. When man philosophizes, he ascends the chain of being towards the angels, and communion with God. When he fails to exercise his intellect, he vegetates. Pico did not fail to notice that this system made philosophers like himself among the most dignified human creatures.  
&gt;  
&gt;The idea that men could ascend the chain of being through the exercise of their intellectual capacities was a profound endorsement of the dignity of human existence in this earthly life. The root of this dignity lay in his assertion that only human beings could change themselves through their own [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will), whereas all other changes in nature were the result of some outside force acting on whatever it is that undergoes change. He observed from history that philosophies and institutions were always in change, making man's capacity for self-transformation the only constant. Coupled with his belief that all of creation constitutes a symbolic reflection of the divinity of God, Pico's philosophies had a profound influence on the arts, helping to elevate writers and painters from their medieval role as mere artisans to the Renaissance ideal of the artist as genius.

My own philosophically-ignorant mind is blown away about how these ideas sound perfectly in harmony with the arc of Eleanor and gang.  I'm guessing that would happen with nearly any ""mainstream"" philosopher we'd look up. That being said, I'm betting on my man Pico.

Maybe homeboy got to heaven and convinced the-good-place folks that true ""goodness"" was defined by knowledge, not deeds.  He was an orator, so perhaps he spoke to defend humans saying they are inherently ignorant so should be forgiven as long as they are shown to strive for knowledge.   His ideas were misinterpreted though.  Universal knowledge is astronomical (ahem, Janet) and if humans are now judged on closing that gap, ain't no one getting in. 

This shirt theory leaves out so many details - like how does this change in The Good Place impact the neutral accounting system?  Why did they fight over Mindy StClair? How does Michael know about pop-culture and bow-ties, but not know this?  It seems like a fact that demons would celebrate!  Can't you see Shawn putting this in his email signature? And wouldn't Vickie take credit somehow?

I dont think thats true for a few reasons (aside from how dark it would be for this show):

1. I believe one of the writers said that they didnt want the moral desert issue to imply that all religious people go to the Bad Place, so I dont think were meant to think that the points system is *designed* to be cruel (even if in practice it works out that way.) The system wouldnt universally condemn children unless it was simply an oversight, and I dont see how it could be when the system has existed for all of human history. In ancient times, the *majority* of people born didnt make it to adulthood. If the system was initially designed to be fair and just went off the rails as time went on, there must have been some mechanism in place to deal with the kid problem.

2. Michael changes his view on the points system because hanging around Team Cockroach makes him realize that people can change, and the system doesnt take that into account. But I dont see how he couldnt have thought of this problem earlier if The Bad Place was full of literal babies, who havent even developed a sense of self yet. And theres no way every single dead kid is in TBP without him knowing about *any* of them, because again, there are a lot. (And thats not even considering what a mess it would be if the accountants start tallying points at conception. TBP would be at least  embryos.)

3. If Michael somehow DIDNT know there were babies in the Bad Place, he would have assumed they were all in the Good Place and put a couple of fake babies in his neighborhood for flavor. Plus babies provide too much opportunity for innocently-presented torture not to keep on hand.

4. We didnt see any children memorialized in the hall of low-level badness (or whatever it was called) in S2, and thats the level of bad most kids would be. Put gum in Susies hair? -150 points.

So, I have a couple of theories of what might happen to kids in lieu of being sent to TGP/TBP:

1. Kids under a certain age are reincarnated and get another shot to earn points. Michael says in S1E1 that Hindus got it a little bit right and Buddhists did too. While its possible that just refers to the idea of your actions generating good or bad karma that becomes relevant when you die, the idea of your actions mattering in the afterlife is pretty widespread among religions, so it would make sense if Michael was talking about something people are more likely to associate with those particular religions.

2. Kids do go to the bad place, but arent tortured. They go to neighborhoods perfectly suited to them, and are cared for by childfree people who got sent to the Bad Place. (And who get an electric shock anytime they act impatient or refuse to play, similar to the baby shower Real Eleanor described having to plan between normal tortures.)

TL;DR - I dont think kids are tortured. I think theyre either reincarnated or used to torture others.",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. If nobody has gotten into the Good Place in 500 years, then that means Mindy St. Claire has had the biggest point total in 500 years.

2. If Mindy St. Claire is the only one to have gotten into the middle place, that means that Abraham Lincoln is in the bad place.

3. Which, if this is true, means that Mindy St. Claire's ATTTEMPT to start her charity, whatever concequences its creation may have had, and whatever negative actions she had done in her life WERE higher than abolishing slavery in yhe United States and whatever negative actions Abraham Lincoln did.

4. Then, if this true, implies that the people who tally points (or at a bare minimum the higher-ups who decide split decision cases) have the ability to see the future to determine if an action has potential positive outcomes.

5. Which, if that is true, opens up so many questions. Why are there non-futureseeing accountants providing points and grading actions in real time if future actions have concequence? Who sees the future and determines concequence?

6. Additionally, IF you assume that the Bad Place are fudging scores to get more victims, how did Mindy St. Claire of all people manage to be THE one whose real-time actions had enough of an impact to stir the Good Place into action, but not Abraham Lincoln?

7. Also, if you take concequence into consideration, couldn't Abraham Lincoln abolishing slavery have the positive concequence of every positive action every freeman (and descendant) made, as well as the bad? And if THAT is true, wouldn't the same happen to Mindy snd every person saved by her charity is now privy to affecting her score? Where does concequence stop?

But there's something interesting about her Medium Place: it's in the Bad Place.

As far as we've seen, there are three realms in the afterlife, and you can only travel between them using special portals. There's the Bad Place, the Neutral Zone, and the Good Place. Michael, a literal demon, had no idea how to get to the Good Place; he once set up a fake device like the real one in this episode (suggesting he had seen one before), but he had clearly never been there himself. The humans couldn't even get to the Neutral Zone by themselves; they snuck in through a portal in Bad Place HQ, and then later got there through Janet's void.

But Eleanor was able to get to Mindy's house by train.

Rewatching Mindy St. Claire's intro video, I'm struck that Beadie never explicitly says that the Good Place wanted Mindy. She says:

&gt; ""They didn't [get you], but neither did we. A compromise was made, the neighborhood you are in now, by yourself.""

And at the end of the video:

&gt; ""Welcome to eternal mediocrity. Welcome to The Medium Place.""

For a representative of the Good Place, she seems positively *delighted* to welcome someone to ""eternal mediocrity"". And it's not because she's happy about everything. Twice in the video, Trevor harasses her, and she's pretty clearly annoyed.

So I don't think we're being asked to believe that Mindy is the best person of the past 500 years. The Medium Place is a real neighborhood, but it's not a realm. She still effectively ended up in the Bad Place. Someone -- and we don't yet know who, or why, or how important they are -- just pulled some strings to make sure that she wouldn't be tortured, just left alone.

Also makes sense how easy it was for them to hack a portal to earth. So now Michael and the gang will try to essentially prove that the bad place is ruling over everything and go to some kind of higher court or the real rulers of creation. Now in my theory i don't think they will show the creator of everything as then questions arise as to who created the creator etc. What in my theory happens is that there is essentially a board of good place beings and bad place beings  and awakened Janets (that is what i call our Janet who went from a computer to a human/computer). Now what i think happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Michael is an update. Essentially the Higher Council noticed the hack by the bad place and also saw the point system being horrible so they started guiding Michael towards realizing that and put him as the hero to fix the system from within. Because the higher council is so powerful, their only choice would have been to reboot the entire system which would have been like every time your computer needs a windows/mac update you re-install your windows/mac all over again, that way losing files and settings. Knowing that the Higher Council intervening directly would have essentially made the system crumble,what they did is what updates do now. instead of reinstalling your windows by removing windows 1.0 and installing windows 1.1. they updated only the parts that needed updating slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

So Michael and the gang will :  

A) expose the bad place

B) fix the loophole

C) start getting the good people from the bad place

D) changing the entire system entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

So it will be cool seeing that happen over the seasons and the good and bad place fighting them on it and finally the season finale is michael finally fixing the entire system and when he presses enter to apply his changes what he sees is.

I will give a couple of caveats: 1) somebody else may have already come up with this -- if so, I apologize; 2) the best that be said for this is that I can't find anything that specifically contradicts it. The supporting evidence is fairly thin, so maybe this is just head cannon for me.

I think Val is from The Good Place (the real one).

We first see Val in S1E13 in flashbacks. She is in the architects' office in The Bad Place. Her precise role is unclear, but she is in the area marked ""Architects Only"" and she seems generally helpful and supportive. She forgets ""which is regular and which is antimatter"". She's also present during Michael's pitch meeting.

I suspect (and this is purely supposition) that the writers did not have a long term plan for Val during Season 1. Season 2 changes things, though.

Next, she's in S2E7 (*Janet and Michael*). She's present when Michael presents Janet to Shawn, and asks if it was really that easy to walk in and take a Janet. My hypothesis here is that Val ensured that it was easy for Michael to take Janet in order to allow Janet's positive influence on Michael and the Soul Squad.

Val's next appearance is in S2E11 (*Rhonda, Diana, Jake, and Trent*). She's there for the infiltration of the Bad Place team into the Medium Place. Val is the one who lets Michael know that there's a party downstairs where the humans are. Without that piece of information, it's much more likely that the humans would have been caught.

Val is in the S3E1 opener. She doesn't do much except check in on Shawn and the hackers. She doesn't appear to be designing a new Bad Place neighborhood, but there's not much one way or another.

In S3E8 (*The Worst Possible Use of Free Will*), Val is shown coming to earth with Shawn, Vicki, and Glenn. We know without question, of course, that Shawn, Vicki, and Glenn are demons. 

In S3E9 (*Don't Let the Good Life Pass You By*), Val is present for the attack on the Puking Moose. Her participation in the fight, though, is that she ""attempts"" to marbleize Janet. She doesn't go after the humans or Michael, and it seems like marbleizing Janet solo is a tactic which is doomed to fail. I don't think she was actually trying to cause harm, but to stall for time.

In short, I think Val is an angel sent from The Good Place to do something. Maybe initially she was just gathering information. Maybe she has a specific mission, but she's definitely become attached somehow to these four humans over time. Like I said at the beginning though, the best I can say for this is that I can't find anything to contradict the idea specifically...",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm very, very sure of this fact because we know that this show is Schur's attempt at making a work about morality, there's an earnest, good faith effort to actually critique attempts at construction of a moral framework, and I think an understanding of eternal reward/punishment is incompatible with our understanding of what a moral universe would look like.

I do not think the bad place alone would be able to help. Here are the suspect.
- The Doorman
- Gen the Judge
- Good Place Head Accountant
- Michael
- Neutral Janet
- sex investigator

I think we can all assume that Michael is not bad so we can cancel him out. Also I dont think the doorman would do it, because hes just a sweet frog loving person. That leaves The Judge, The Head accountant and Neutral Janet, below I will put cases for all.

Jen: She is supposed to be impartial and not know anything, but we already know shes okay with breaking that by watching things like Ken Burns Vietnam. Also she seems to have a weird infatuation for Chidi, when why would an impartial judge have any feelings on people they like. Also I feel some of the tests she gave were there not to test but torment. Like how is caring about what others think of you , a human emotion, a thing that can you get you into the bad place. She also just seems like a person who does not always follow rules.

The Head Accountant: we barely know anything, but he also seems like a fishy character. When asked about facts of if bad place could hack in, he doesnt even research and gets defensive. If he was really supposed to be head accountant, wouldnt he want to investigate every claim? I agree this is a bit of a weak claim, so would love thoughts on this.

Sex investigator: this guy hates his job so much I could see him betraying them, but I find this a weak claim anyway.

Neutral Janet: we already know that Janets can become opposite like with good Janet being able to morph into bad Janet. Although bad Janet cant become good, but maybe she can be neutral. I also feel this would be a very easy way for them to sneak into accountant headquarters. This is my best guess on who the infiltrator is.

Even tho bad place is smart enough to make a portal to human world, they could technically get into accountant, but I feel for such a big operation they need an inside man. Would love thoughts on this.

I've been thinking about it, and here are some problems I imagine might be interesting if they happened during their stay in the Good Place. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Everybody is welcomed into the Good Place, but Michael, who has to be retired because technically he is a demon. The Good Place will only welcome the humans if they leave Michael behind, opening up a whole conversation on the morals of abandoning Michael. 
2. Alternatively, the Angels and stuff welcome the humans AND Michael, but he will face problems. He isn't technically supposed to be in that realm, and so some stuff will go wrong with him, in the same way humans being in the Void made some issues with their existence
3. Our main six decide that they have to leave in order to achieve a higher goal (changing the points system), and right when they go to leave, the Angels say that they have to leave Janet behind, because she is legally their property. Either they will face the ethics of abandoning her, or they will steal her, adding to their crimes and/or causing the Good Place to shut her down through some sort of operating system, and they have to return in order to save her.

Episode 6 (Janet and Michael) opens with a flashback of Michael stealing Janet from the good place. Michael then explains what he did to Shawn and another demon called Val.

The conversation then goes:

- Val: ""Where did you get this? Did you actually get into the Good Place somehow?""
- Michael: ""Didn't need to. They keep their Janets in a neutral pocket dimension beneath the shapeless time void. It's right next to accounting.""
- Val: ""And you just walked in and stole her? It was that easy? You didn't have to choke out an angel or anything?""
- Michael: ""Doors were unlocked. No security. It makes sense, right? They're good, so they're stupid and trusting"".

In light of what we learned in the latest episode this is very interesting. Michael thinks here that they are not guarding their Janets because they are stupid and trusting, but what if it's more than that?

Essentially we're watching a version of Dante's Divine Comedy. The Divine Comedy is mostly known for its first book, Inferno, which features a journey through hell by Dante as lead by the Poet Virgil. 

Really important things: There is outside of the gates of Hell a place of Limbo, aka a medium place, where its ok, but kinda mediocre, as its filled with Virtuous Pagans. Deeper down there is a series of circles based on your sins with ironic punishments (which can fit some of the plots of season 1). However, at the bottom of Hell, where Satan is trapped, is the exit to Purgatory. 

That exit is in fact on the other side of the world from Europe, where we now know Australia is. 

Once Dante reaches Purgatory in Australia, he begins climbing a giant mountain with a series of levels with people fighting their sins to overcome their flaws and become people worthy of the good place.

According to the precedent that would have been set by Tahani's case, Doug should have a negative point total, or at least one a lot lower than what he has. But the accountant tells us that Doug has about half a million positive points accumulated.

Chidi is the Wise Child, who is focused on all of the rules, minutiae, and regulations regarding how to observe Passover.

Tahani is the Wicked Child, who is self-centered, focused on themselves only and not seeing themselves as part of any collective or community at all.

Jason is the Simple Child, who simply asks Whats this?

Eleanor is the Child Who Does Not Even Know How to Ask a Question. The Haggadah says that you must begin for them and show them how to ask a question and teach them to try to make sense of the story. This is what Eleanor learns to do throughout the series.

Where is the security? Arguably one of the most import places in the universe and part of the very system of the universe is completely unprotected.  Micheal did most if not all the talking to the head accountant, had Michael still been Evil, his infiltration of the point system for evil means would have been super easy. There was no paperwork required for anything Michael asked for or was told.  

The wanted poster, for Interdimensional fugitives, only showed the four humans. Why? Judge gen was furious with Michael and Janet when last she spoke to them. Why are only the humans wanted?  Why were there wanted posters up in the afterlife in the first place?  It was an act of desperation that brought them into the realm in the first place? Judge Gen previously was reluctant to know all things at all time so as to stay impartial. Has that time ended? Did she know what was going to happen? If so she has to know about the demons illegal door and their entering earth. She also has to know that no human has gotten into the good place in 500+ years. She would also also have to know there is something wrong with the system. 

The question becomes; if she does know, why does she not do anything? Does she not care?  Why? 

Also, who or what plays the part of security? Once the humans were seen to be in the afterlife, an alarm was set off. This, one would assume would summon someone or something to capture the humans.

We know that if you get into the Bad Place, you're going to be there being tortured for all of eternity. But we don't know anything about life yet in The Good Place and I think it might have some different rules. 

While the Bad Place wouldn't care about the morality of its inhabitants because, well, there is no morality there, the Good Place would want to have high standards of goodness. Being good means you would never feel like you were ever done being good, right? You wouldn't want to be, if you're a good person. So, it's possible that the Good Place has some point system equivalent that is on-going for its inhabitants but is probably just as broken as the point system to get into an afterlife experience is. So, two broken systems that are feeding on one another result in virtually no one being in the Good Place at the moment. The afterlife point system that we've been watching the characters learn more about is broken because no one has gotten into the Good Place in centuries but the point system in the Good Place is \*also\* broken, resulting in former Good Place residents winding up being tortured in the Bad Place. No one seeks to fix this because no one is in a position to object. The Bad Place demons don't care because it's just more people for them to torture. The Good Place inhabitants think they just weren't good enough and don't protest it because to do so, to them, would be selfish, which wouldn't be good. It goes on and on because there is no one objective to question the system-- until our characters come along. ",3,1,False,self,,,,,

&gt;Michael: ""Can you just tell me his total so far?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Accountant: ""Looks like he's at 520,000 points. Well done, Doug.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Michael: ""So... so that's good?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Accountant: ""Oh, that's excellent! Wait... He's 68 years old? Oh, that's terrible. He's screwed.""

It is important to note that we do not know what Doug's behavior was like before he learned about the afterlife. However, I think it is reasonable to say he did not necessarily care about the utilitarian implications of his actions before his mushroom trip revelation. In S3E8, Doug's interview with Michael and Janet shows us that he only decided to alter his behavior once he learned what the afterlife was like. If Doug is currently 68 and he had his mushroom trip at any year between 1970 and 1979 according to S1E1, Doug was anywhere from 20 to 29 when he began altering his behavior. This means that he had lived at least two decades in which he did not care about how his actions affected his points total.

But what about Mindy and the Medium Place? I think that u/schala09 has a helpful post about how she is in a Bad Place of her own. Her charity must have really made an impact on a lot of lives after her death for there to be a dispute about where she should be. I actually think that her charity still increases her point total posthumously, but that the actions she took during her life will always keep her in the Medium Place. She was not necessarily the best person to live in 521 years, but her charity must have drastically increased her posthumous point total enough for there to be some form of dispute to alter what her Bad Place looks like.

While S1E1 explicitly states that the major world religions each only got about 5% right about the afterlife, I will use theological terminology to help explain what this information means in terms of getting into the Good Place and the potential reforms the Soul Squad will try to fight for. Clearly, the universe is neither Calvinist or Universalist in ""The Good Place"". One's free actions determine if they get in to the Good Place and not everyone is worthy of being in the Good Place. However, there is no possibility of any form redemption in this universe. If a man like Doug can spend the majority of his life dedicating himself to good and still have the actions of his early teens and adulthood affect him, then one cannot redeem themselves within their lifetime. If a woman like Mindy is remembered more for her charity than her cocaine habit after her death, then one cannot redeem themselves through how history remembers oneself either. This lack of redemption in the universe is perhaps a reason why many world religions did not understand the universe in ""The Good Place"". The Accounting Department (as it stands) is looking for people who are fundamentally good throughout their entire lifetime.

This brings me to what kind of universe the Soul Squad is fundamentally aiming at. They represent the ability for people to change and redeem themselves. The idea that people have the ability to redeem themselves is Arminian in nature. I don't believe that the Soul Squad wants to save people like Columbus or Hitler, but they do want to save those who chose a life of good later in life who are hurt by the Accounting Department. While no amount of human theology will truly explain what this universe is like, we can use these terms to help us understand what is going on. After all, we're talking about the afterlife here!",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Eleanor started her journey in the desperate hope that she could earn a spot in Heaven by working hard at becoming ethical. A whole season was spent trying to fight her nature... Only to discover there was never any way to escape The Bad Place.

Season two included Micheal in this. The whole season was dedicated to Team Cockroach fighting tooth and nail to keep from getting caught by Vicky and the other Demons, until Micheal could get them to the Real Good Place, only for Micheal to tell them there was never any way to get there.

Finally, we have Season Three; where the team spends half a season trying to become better people, and Micheal fighting madly to keep them improving, only for them to see the Door; and suddenly there is no way for them to earn points at all.

So the second half of season three changes the rules: If we can't get to heaven, then we still have people we want to go there for us... Only to find out now that nobody goes to The Good Place. At all. Not only was there no hope for our heroes, or their families; there was no hope for anybody at all!

They keep moving the goalposts, by hitting us with futility, over and over. Team Cockroach has been going for two seasons now on the theory of: ""We have literally no hope; so let's be bold!""

The last episode ended with them arriving at The Real Good Place. Look at that room. Everything is at least 500 years old. They haven't evolved. The Accountants keep an up-to-the-second record of every new sin; and Heaven hasn't had a new thought in five hundred years.

My theory? I don't think The Bad Place hacked the System. I think the Good Place did. The Bad Place is fine with having exclusive rights to the human race; and heaven doesn't want to play anymore.

Eleanor is an example of why: Look at her response to a fake Good Place. ""Can't swear? Bad. Can't get hungover? Good! Can't call someone names behind their back? Bad. Limitless shrimp? Good!""

A hedonist in heaven is a great plot for a comedy; but I wonder how many people in the Actual Good Place reacted the same way to their moral dessert? If so, I could see the Angels deciding that they don't want any more humans coming in. They want to keep the Riffraff out.

Dante's Inferno had the idea that you could escape Hell by going deeper and deeper, until you essentially came out the other side. I wonder if this show is following the same formula.

Which is why I think that's the next circle of Hell. Not only does the Accountant not care that the System's broken; but neither does the Ultimate Nice Guys in the cosmos. Not only do they not care it's broken, but they're the ones that broke it.

We know that any torments of The Bad Place can be 'reset'. We know that Eleanor spent a whole season insisting that she should go to a Medium Place. Given TGP's penchant for turning early lines into major plot devices, I wonder if that's where this is going; with a reformed Demon demanding a New Deal for the afterlife.

Obviously, Chidi is teaching the entire squad the entire history of ethics and moral philosophy, from the ancients to the modern day, with a special emphasis on contractualism. However, the existence of the Good Place, and especially the existence of the Accountants, must mean that there must be one overriding ""rule"" that governs all of the points. 

For example, in S3E10, we see that whenever a new act is performed by humans, that action is sent to various accountants to compute the specific point value of that action. Afterwards, it is sent to billions of other accountants, who all reach the same conclusion. This must mean that there is some rule book that allows the accountants to evaluate this action. Furthermore, once an action is assigned points, those points are valid - forever!

Such a rigid reading of the points system, which does govern the entire universe, seems to show that utilitarianism could not possibly operate in this world. After all, there should not be a difference between shooting a person, whether that person is an innocent civilian or a corrupt dictator, right? If we go back to the trolley problem, the points system seems to show that pulling the switch is always worse than not pulling the switch, because you can get negative points for doing something, while the same is not true for not doing an action. 

So if deontology really does rule the universe, who establishes the rules, and what is the purpose of those rules? Clearly, noone in the Good Place, the Neutral Place, or the Bad Place are humans. That immediately strikes out parts of contractualism - the people who make the rules seem to suffer none of the consequences of the rules.

&gt;And here is why tampering is impossible because this score is then double-checked by 3 billion other accountants, all chosen at random, and if they all come to the same conclusion, which they always do, it makes this official.

There has to be *more* than 3 billion accountants for these 3 billion to be chosen at random. So just to make the math easy, lets assume (conservatively) there are at least 3 billion, 650 million accountants in that office.

3,650,000,000 accountants / 365 days a year  **** = **10,000,000!**

10 million accountants should be having a birthday any day of the year.

My theory is Santa Claus is an eternal being, perhaps an angel but I'm not too sure and he uses the points system given by the accountants to determine who deserves presents. Since the system is clearly ruined it would explain why many adults have been forced to give their children presents as they believe that Santa is gone since no one got presents in a long time. If kids do not get presents then they would assume they were naughty (which they actually were due to the poor system).

So did he not end up in the Good Place after all? &lt;!",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So if you have not seen up to Episode 10 of Season 3 then go catch up so you don't have spoilers.

There we go now you are reading here so that means you've either seen up to Episode 10 of Season 3 or you are okay with spoilers. As established in this episode nobody has gotten into the good place in over 500 years. Specifically 521 years ago. So a tip of the hat to all the people that came up with the theory that nobody was getting into the Good Place. Seems you were on the right track. But now into new theory territory.

We admittedly we don't know exactly what year the show takes place in, they are a bit vague about that. But let's say the current year in the show is 2018. That would put us in the year 1497. A quick look into important events reveals a whole bunch of nothing specific. Sure some battles were fought but the big thing that was going on was more exploration. This is a good thing because if the show doesn't take place in 2018 but instead just some year near now, that puts us in the same ballpark.

But what does that have to do with the good place? See Michael seems to think it's the bad place that has rigged things so that nobody gets into the Good Place. But I'm not so sure. I'm fairly sure it's the Good Place that has rigged it. Let's first look at why I think that, and then why I think they wouldn't want anyone in.

1. Good Place Janet Warehouse. When Michael stole Janet he remarked that they didn't even bother guarding them and chalked it up to the Good Place being to trusting. But if the Good Place hasn't gotten any new people in over 500 years they won't have needed to build a new Neighborhood in almost that long, and so the Janet warehouse is likely something they aren't really thinking about.
2. The Good Place KNOWS they aren't getting new people. There is no way they can't know.
3. Everything about the afterlife seems very compartmentalized, in that people in charge of handling aspect A know nothing about aspect B other than it's a thing that exists and that there are people there that take care of that. This helps obscure the fact that nobody is going to the good place. But again it's not obscuring it from the Good Place. The Good Place MUST know. Thus it's only obscuring it from everyone else.

So let's consider this logically and pretend Michael is right. What reason would his Boss (who does seem to be in on the conspiracy or at least aware of it) have in hiding it from the people of the Bad Place? If we pretend for a moment that that each side wants souls for some reason then clearly the bad place might want to rig things so they get more souls, but they would also want the Good Place to not know they aren't getting their fair share. But because the bad place is getting ALL souls and not just more, the Good Place absolutely knows. So clearly both sides don't want souls.

This gives us 3 other options:

1. The Good Place wants souls, but the Bad Place doesn't want souls. But this doesn't make sense because the Bad Place really want to make sure the gang doesn't go to the Good Place and instead stay in the Bad Place.
2. The Bad Place wants souls, but the Good Place doesn't want souls.
3. Neither the Good Place nor the Bad Place want souls.

As you can see the only thing that makes sense here is if we are in a situation where the Good Place doesn't want souls. So now let's revisit Michael's theory that the Bad Place is scamming the system to get all the souls. The Bad Place doesn't need to hide it from the Good Place that they are taking all the souls because the Good Place doesn't want them anyway. But why hide it from the Demons like Michael? If the Bad Place wants souls then why hide from them that they get ALL souls. The Bad Place if they are the ones running this Conspiracy have absolutely nothing to gain from hiding it from their own people.

As with all Conspiracy theories you simply have to ask who stands to profit from the Conspiracy. Sure it seems like the Bad Place is profiting by getting all the souls, but that's not what we are questioning here. We want to know who profits from keeping it a secret, and we've already established that the Bad Place doesn't profit from keeping the secret.

But what about the Good Place? If they are the ones that are actually behind this Conspiracy that means they stand to profit in some way. Well again let's go back to the want thing. They don't WANT any souls (we'll get to why in a moment). If they don't want any souls, it makes sense to keep it a secret because let's look at Michael. He's actively trying to help the group get in the good place. Even if we say that's abnormal it's established that there are neutral figures that look at cases. As long as NOBODY knows about the Conspiracy then in the rare times a case comes before such a neutral figure like one of the judges it comes as no surprise when the ruling comes down as ""Go to the Bad Place"".

The reason for this is that due to the compartmentalization of the afterlife, people like the Judge tend to just assume everything is going right outside their current interest and then when they assess a case and say ""Bad Place"" they figure that the system that did the original assessment was right all along and not tampered with. If though the Conspiracy wasn't in place though then people like the Judge might try to fix things and correct the mistake of people ending up in the bad place that should have been in the Good Place.

So the Conspiracy is there to help the Good Place keep people out, but that just leaves WHY the Good Place doesn't want people.

My current thought is that the Good Place realized that the world is just to full of people (mind you last person accepted was during an era of exploration). My thought is that Michael's fake good place is actually fairly accurate... in that people just end up in petty fights and torturing each other like Michael was trying to do. With the world so full of such diverse people a breakdown in Good Place neighborhood stability is sure to happen in rather short order.

It seems that the Good Place did the classic ""The only way to keep the Good Place good is to not let people come and ruin it."" action.

OF COURSE... there is one other idea...

This has all been YET ANOTHER trick by Michael. That it'll play out like I'm saying in that everyone's like The Good Place doesn't want anyone. But then the group will ""fix"" things and get into the ""Good Place"" and accept that Michael's version of the Good Place is as good as it's going to get thus causing them all to torture each other for the rest of eternity like Michael originally planned.",10,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Anyway, I have been attending some basics in Islam Courses and Knowing Islam courses for the past few weeks. I was born and raised Catholic so when I watched TGP I always assumed that what the major religions got right was the concept of good deeds = rewards in afterlife. 

After attending lessons in Islam though, I realized that Islam more or less was the basis for TGP's point system. Really awesome realization for me. 

Anyway why do I say this? Here are a few examples:

There are three holy sites in Islam:
Visiting Mecca - 100,000 points
Visiting Medina - 5,000 points
Visiting Jerusalem - 1,000 points

When they pray 5 times a day:

Praying less than 5 times = 1 prayer is 1 point
Praying 5 times a day = bonus points for completion

Ablution before prayer:

If you cleanse the required body parts = points and your prayer counts

However there are additional body parts where you may or may not wash but if you wash... bonus points.

There are a lot more. Good deeds, helping the needy, all will earn you points. And the angels will list all of your deeds down and hand it down to one of the major angels (forgot which name) sort of like the head accountant to see if you deserve the good place or not.

I was seriously smiling throughout the entire lesson specially when the teachers kept mentioning points. ",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Martin Luther, a monk who was in constant spiritual anguish over whether he was being pious enough to save his soul (think Doug Forcett), realized that there was Biblical justification for the idea that actions cant get you into Heaven - only the grace of God does so.

Martin Luther came up with these ideas in the early 1510s. Widespread circulation started around 1517 when he supposedly nailed the 95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg, and the ideas were extremely influential. If Earth time is now offset by ~20 years so 2040ish, his radical ideas couldve caused the Good/Bad Place accounting problems. 

Of course this assumes that the afterlife is heavily influenced by European and Christian philosophy/theology. 

Btw, not sure if Luther wouldve gotten in based on the points system. He challenged church corruption and his ideas have (maybe) relieved spiritual anguish, but also was super anti-Semitic. 

ONE MORE THING: Doug Forcett named that snail after Martin Luther (most people probably thought that referred to MLK, which is understandable, but Dougs obsessive piety is so Luther-like... seems to me like it cant be coincidence). ",43,1,False,self,,,,,

Its not that I hate the character, I just dont see what he adds other than comic relief? If he was the only one who was funny, hed be there to provide some laughs, but since this is literally a comedy it means hes just one funny character in a cast of even funnier characters. 

The way I see it, Jason is almost too dumb to function and doesnt seem to grow or even develop as a character. Most of all, he hasnt become a better person like Eleanor. Chidi and Tahani are not on Eleanors level either, but at least they have become very aware of their behaviour/problems and have been actively trying to change themselves. Jason, on the other hand, seems even dumber now that he was in season 1 and doesnt really add anything. On at least two occasions (that I can remember) the group actually sent Jason away when they were hatching a plan because he added dumb and useless comments to their conversation and wasnt helping at all.

Meaning they started off with dying in - let's say - 2016 and they had years of reboots in the bad place - 
521 - and they each lasted a while so that maybe is 500 years,
And then when they were sent back to earth they went back 500 years to the time of their death to see IF they can come better people,
And when they go back in - they are back to where they are - 500 years in the future, a time where no one got in for many years due to the crazy thing Michael did that sent them back in time - and messed up everything...

This is the general gist of the theory - there are parts unclear like:
How do we know the good/bad place have the same concept of time - especially that the demons are chasing them as if it is happening now
Or like how would what Michael did affect the whole system?
Maybe the whole experiment community was messing with the system and they didn't even know it...

What happened 521 years ago?

Everyone is looking back 521 years looking for answers, but you guys are all looking in the wrong place.

Eleanor died in season 1, let's say it was 2016, Michael then went thru over 800 reboots of the community. Eventually he convince the judge to send them back to Earth. 

All the reboots took a few hundred years.

The current season is back at 2016/17 when Eleanor almost died. Which means they went back in time. 

But when they want to accounting they went back to heaven time which is a jump forward of a few hundred years.

There is no clear consensus on Reddit on exactly how long the 800+ reboots took, but I would guess it's 521 years.

So what happened 521 years ago? Elanor died / fake good place was created

It's possible that in order to get the fake good place running they had to reroute or change something to make it register as the good place and therefore even good place worthy people were instead being rerouted and thus no one got into the actual good place for 521 years..

-

The thing is that because they went back in time and undid the 4 deaths it may have created a butterfly effect and messed up everything, because if no Eleanor death there was no fake good place, everything that happened there never actually happened. Not sure what this does to the whole story. Messing with time is always tricky
 
There is also the issue of what is 521 years of time on the Jeremy Bearimy scale? 521 years in heaven time can be 1 day and 8 centuries on our time. Or 5 seconds.

Basically, for 99% of human history, you would only meet about 100 people in your life. So if you treated all 100 really well, then you would get into the Good Place. Overall, thats not too difficult. But now, its possible that you would interact with 100 people very day, maybe even every hour.

Michael believes the problem is that the bad place is hacking the system, I saw other people saying that the good place doesn't want more people, so they don't give a shit.  


For me the problem is within the system itself, the accounting of the points is not individual.  


The accountant said that the first time someone does an act on earth, this act is avalueted and some points are graded, so anyone who does that in the future will get the same points. This system doesn't consider the intention nor the consequences of the act, but just the act itself, there's the problem.  


Like the example the accountant gave:  
Act - Throwing a rock at someone =&gt; less xxx points.  
So anyone in the history of the earth will get less points when they throw a rock, disregarding the intention.  


Imagine someone throwing a rock at the car window to save a dog inside from dying from heat.  
This person would get minus points, completely disregarding the intention and the consequences of his/her act, ignoring that the person throwed a rock to save someone.  


I believe the big problem in the system is that they consider the act ISOLATED and forget that each individual will do acts for different reasons and purposes.

I think they might have all earned enough points to qualify to get in during the visit, either now, or whenever the system gets fixed.

Michael said they couldn't earn points because their motivations were corrupt. Because the humans believed this and thought they no matter what they did they were going to The Bad Place- their motivations actually weren't corrupt. Their actions were altruistic and they were just trying to do good- they weren't doing them to get into The Good Place because they thought they couldn't get in no matter what.

Michael might have even realized this- when the humans heard them talking about the afterlife and how it worked, telling them they were damned may have been the only way to give them non-corrupt motivations.

And trying to help people get into TGP may be worth quite a lot of points. 

It might be that they couldn't qualify right now with the system broken, but if they ever do get it fixed their time back on Earth may be what qualified them. 

Another thought- could Michael and Janet have earned points as well for their stay on Earth? That could justify Michael qualifying for The Good Place even though he is a Bad Place architect, and give a Janet a defense to stay in case anyone tries to say she should be marbelized for being corrupted working with a Bad Place architect.

(Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/a6uxgy/s3e10_why_has_no_one_gotten_into_the_good_place/,marpsharp,1545008799,"I've seen people writing different theories on here about it and I was talking with someone about a theory that maybe when they go to the accounting office - they go back to the time period of when they actually died the first time.

Meaning they started off with dying in - let's say - 2016 and they had years of reboots in the bad place - 
521 - and they each lasted a while so that maybe is 500 years,
And then when they were sent back to earth they went back 500 years to the time of their death to see IF they can come better people,
And when they go back in - they are back to where they are - 500 years in the future, a time where no one got in for many years due to the crazy thing Michael did that sent them back in time - and messed up everything...

This is the general gist of the theory - there are parts unclear like:
How do we know the good/bad place have the same concept of time - especially that the demons are chasing them as if it is happening now
Or like how would what Michael did affect the whole system?
Maybe the whole experiment community was messing with the system and they didn't even know it...
But this is the general thought.

What if this first case was someone who got in on a technicality or a mistrial, which caused the system to become stricter and more definitive on point values during life.

Because as a lot of us are thinking, the problem seems to be that people arent earning enough points in their lifetime to get in. Maybe Jonas Salk didnt. But Mindy showed us that the afterlife does care about the question of posthumous Good Place Points, which Salk is definitely getting. Why did the Medium Place problem come up with Mindy and not before, with Salk? Was it because Mindy was so extravagantly bad in life it broke the system, where Salk was more average so it didnt care? Or is the system just totally broken?

I spent somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour searching for this, so I apologize if I missed it. (Just feel free to link me to the original discussion.)

But one of the more curious things (in my opinion) that was said in the most recent episode is that Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani are now the first humans ever to not go directly to the Good or Bad Place upon their deaths.

So what does this mean for Mindy? I originally assumed it meant that, since no one has been in the Good Place in 521 years, that she was immediately sent to the Bad Place upon her death, but due to the efforts of the Good Place, she was eventually moved out of the Bad Place and into her Medium Place.

However, in episode 1x12, ""Mindy St. Claire"", Mindy says, ""I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time."" This implies that she didn't wake up in the Bad Place.

Of course Mindy's timeline is weird to begin with. She died in the 1980s, she was placed in the Medium Place, and then 30 years later she met Eleanor. That would line up with the Earth timeline except for that ""when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time"". So where as ""long time"" back when Season 1 was written probably amounted to a number of weeks or months, Jeremy Bearimy probably allows that span of time to be years or longer.

So did Mindy get sent straight to the Bad Place when she died? Did she spend days/weeks/months/years being tortured there before they blanked her memory and put her in the Medium Place? Did Mindy originally get sent to the Good Place but had that information redacted from her file when she was moved to the Medium Place? Or was Neil mistaken about Eleanor and co. being the first people to not go straight to the Good or Bad Place when they died? Did Mindy's case slip Neil's mind?",21,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The date of death is accurate assuming the setting of the episode is 2018. Also, the writers tend to lean on western myths of the afterlife and Christian saints are easy to research.

So, I was re-watching season 1 recently, and in the first episode, Micheal tells Eleanor that all American presidents besides Lincoln are in the bad place. But, in episode 9 or 10 (depends on if you count episode 1 as 2 episodes) the gang learns that no-one has gotten into The Good Place in 500 years. Now, if we assume that Micheal is telling the truth about Lincoln, and the orientation video in S1:E1 (which says that ending slavery nets +814292.09 points), surely Lincoln would have gotten into The Good Place. Mindy St. Claire is the only Medium Place person we have seen, and she was a sleazy corporate lawyer hooked on cocaine till the end of her life. Surely Lincoln would have gotten enough points to get into the good place.

Unless of course Micheal is just lying to Eleanor, and that video doesn't have accurate point scores at all, seeing as we learn in S3 that the accountants have that stuff locked down tight.",14,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I tried many many Twitter advanced searches and only one yielded results, of the same picture from the instagram post:

[Twitter search result!] (https://imgur.com/hz3R6Xg)

There are also no results on (at least the first page of) Google that suggest he's going to be on the show. There is an article from Vulture from January this year about who might play the Judge that has him in the list of potentials. You'd think if a big name like Weird Al had been signed up to be on the show there'd at least be some kind of Buzzfeed ""OMG Weird Al on The Good Place and Everyone's Freaking Out!!"" article.

Have I missed something? I'd love to be proven wrong on this, I love Weird Al, but I can't find anything that actually confirms he's going to be on the show. Does anyone have any concrete proof?",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Meanwhile, speculation.....

Hypothetical numbers follow
Maybe a thousand, perhaps 10,000 or even 50,000 years ago it was decided that the worst of all people would be sent to the bad place.  Say 99.9% of people go to the good place and 0.01% of people go to the bad place.
The Bad Place, being the dicks that they are, insisted upon absolute numbers.
Let's say (see disclaimer above) that 100,000 people existed at the time.  No one could imagine a million people existing, much less Billions and Billions (Sagan reference) having died!
The good place said OK.
Unfortunately, that set a hard limit.
To get into the good place, you have to have earned more points than the last guy to get in.
Sacrificing your life gets you a lot of points.  But if enough people have been born and ultimately with the odds done so, it gets even harder than that to get in.
And so it goes...

Alright, so I was thinking lately about a possible connection between Santa Clause and the afterlife. I think Santa could be a figure from the afterlife whose job it is to give people an indicator of how well they're doing on making it to the Good Place. He chose to do so by giving people a gift if they're on the right track and coal if they're not one day a year. People made that day a holiday. Human parents figured out this mysterious coal or gifts trend and created a whole story out of it to get kids to be good. Now that no one has gotten into the Good Place in 500 years, Santa was forced to always give coal to everyone. Eventually, he decided it was pointless and just gave up. Now parents carry on the tradition by giving their kids gifts but saying they're from Santa. No one realizes that at one point Santa actually did go around the world giving gifts and coal to people depending on their performance that year.

1) The four humans were being used to try to torture Mindy (annoying, never bringing cocaine or joining her in her masturbation sessions). 
2) Mindy was part of the torture. Feeling unable to escape, even after leaving the fake GP. Representation of limbo.
3) Mindy may not human. She is a agent of the Good Place or the Medium Place (I believe there are millions, even billions, of medium places). She is there to try to ruin Michael's experiment and save the humans. If she is human, Mindy could be doing it to try to earn her place in the Good Place as part of a bargain. Michael is unable to stop it or deep down he was always on ther side.

When I first saw the first episode of ""The Good Place"" I was instantly reminded of ""Defending Your Life"" starring Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep.

I was introduced to this movie by.....my moral philosophy professor! It was actually for another course he taught on religion, but I thought that this was a funny coincidence. 

The premise of the film is that when you die, your life is brought to a ""trial"" of sorts to see if you move on, or if you return back to Earth to try again. 

It doesn't raise the moral philosophy questions in the same depth of TGP, but it does delve into personal strength, one's impact on earth, and yes - a little bit of moral philosophy. 

It's not often talked about - I'm not sure why - it's a fantastic movie, a fun watch, and definitely comedic. 

I think most people here would thoroughly enjoy this movie. ",9,1,False,self,,,,,

On top of this, our humans' knowledge of the afterlife and the points system means that their good acts are tainted, because they must be acting in self-interest and not for the sake of goodness. How can they escape this?

By no longer believing in the salvation of The Good Place.

Either Michael, or a higher power than him, faked the accounting we saw, tricking the humans into losing their faith. If not Michael, then who? The Judge is a possibility, having already shown herself willing to listen to Michael's experiment and sympathetic to the humans' plight. Neil from Accounting is also possible - The story of Michael, Janet and the humans may have spread to them, as they need to know everything happening, and it could motivate him to help, whilst keeping a facade of not caring. Finally, Janet. She's always been aware of how the system works, but only through her experience with the humans, especially Jason, and multiple reboots, has given her a new, more emotive perspective. 

I definitely think the system being broken is a significant plot point, but this twist would emphasise the importance of being good without personal gain. This has always been a part of the show and is a theme of Parks and Rec as well, so I think it's something Mike Schur believes in.

Love the show, been lurking here a little for some time. Thought I'd explain a possible explanation for TGP's exclusivity today: we're all going to hell because of rising opportunity costs.

One of my main interests concerning the show is the brokenness of the points system and waiting for the eventual conclusion that you can't possibly decide eternal outcomes for human souls based on points accumulated during life - a wholesale rejection of empirical afterlife consequences, basically. That's what I've been hoping for, at least.

Lately, there's been some discussion here about the last person who got into TGP, in the 1500s. A lot of it is interesting, although many people seem to be making theories based on an improper understanding of information revealed so far. This is me chipping in.

I don't buy that the system is broken because of tampering or corruption or anything like that. I'd love to discuss the whole thing in detail but I sadly don't have the time to go into the detail I'd like to. Instead, there are a few specific theories I like, all of which are loosely related to the concept of opportunity cost.

Opportunity Cost is the idea that for every action you take, there are actions you didn't do instead, and not being able to do them is part of the cost of the action you did take. So if you donate 5 to a homeless man, that's time and resources you're not using to volunteer at the local terminally ill orphaned kittens shelter. That's a thing you failed you do, even though you could have done it.

Now, there's here's no evidence that people lose points for negligently failing to end slavery, cure AIDS or cause world peace. However, it is very probable that the post-Columbian world of the 1500s and later simply tipped the balance of available, understandable, accessible actions very significantly away from good and towards bad. 

Essentially, if it's much, much easier to buy goods made by slaves (because plantations exist), print lies in the press (because it was invented), and displace vulnerable cultures (because you can access them), and much, much harder to positively transform your extended community (because it now consists of the planet's total population) then sufficient points totals are now almost impossible to achieve.

Similarly, any person aware of the wider world who could theoretically affect it if they were truly exceptional is now regularly tanking the opportunity cost of remaining in their community, no matter how distant or impoverished.

Perhaps you're now thinking that this isn't really a coherent theory, but the key here is this:

What if your points threshold to enter TGP is not arbitrary, but instead based on the total potential amount you could achieve? 

If you live in a primitive society where if you make good choices on a daily basis you are consistently hitting the highest possible daily points targets, it's not that hard to get as many points as you possibly could have done.

If you live today, then for every day that you're not doing the best possible things you could do with the technology and context at hand, you're not getting close enough to your theoretical lifetime maximum. And you aren't doing that. Because there's always something more worthy ethical you can do. And there's no way to avoid unethical consumption. 

Incidentally, it's also possible that only one person every few hundred years gets in, or whatever, but that's another perspective I think misses the twist the show is gonna go for (and I hope they'll go for). i.e that it's unfair to expect people to be saints in the post-Columbian world where almost everything is out of our hands and understanding and there are infinite things we could be doing with our time that are more saintly than what we're actually doing.

tl;dr: these days it's much harder to consistently do the best possible things, and you need to always make literally the best available choices to qualify for TGP.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It isn't that the people in the GP don't care about other people, they just feel there's no good answer to the problem.\*

It occurred to me that we've already heard from the accountant that it is the people in the GP that set the threshold for entry, and that the actual setting of this threshold could be itself a massive ethical dilemma. So maybe we aren't going to find out that the people in the GP don't care about the losers on earth. Maybe they do care, but they're stuck in the world's weirdest trolley problem and genuinely have no idea how to solve it. Turning setting the point threshold for getting into the GP itself into yet another moral philosophy dilemma seems right up this show's alley.

Is their goal to help people be as good as possible, or to just reward good people? If to reward good people, you have to define goodness. Sure the accountants set points for individual actions, but by setting the threshold, GP has to define whether an entire life, a whole person, is good. And that's a huge responsibility with no clear cut answer.

If to cause as much altruism as possible, the problem is even worse! Consider some of your options:

Pick a number way too low? Who would try to be good in that scenario? You'll reward at best, mediocre behavior, at worst you'll allow in some bad folks.

The top 1% of point earners in a given time period? Great, you've made getting into the GP a competition, and thereby incentivized reducing the point totals of competitors.  
You could choose a number based on a blueprint, basically saying no one worse than Steve Buscemi should get in. But then 9/11s don't happen every day, and not everyone has the same training/opportunity to go be a firefighter. You'll completely lose track of the context those points were earned in. Over enough time, 1000 years or so, the point total could be come an entirely unrealistic scenario.

Allow for the fact that humans can become better in the afterlife? Then why would they be good on earth if they have an eternity to work things out?

So this is my guess for the next Ep, and the closing of the season. We're going to see that the very act of setting a point threshold is itself an impossible ethical dilemma. It'll end this season on the issue that it began with, the problem of Moral Dessert, which has been the leitmotif of the whole Season 3.",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When Gen is informing Michael of all the weird stuff that happened since he meddled in human affairs, she specifically references Brexit, ""The Greatest Showman"", and the Jaguars making the playoffs.

 - Brexit's vote happened in 2016, due to officially separate the EU in March 2019.

 - The Greatest Showman ended it's theatre run in July 2018 with $435 million.

 - The Jaguars could *still* make the playoffs this year in 2018... (unlikely, but it could potentially still happen.) 

In the next episode, we jump forward a year... so I'm under the current impression the timeline is in 2019. Hopefully this puts to rest all of the questions about where we are on the established timeline (especially given the last episode ""Janet(s)"",) which I won't spoil here.

I had to unfollow [Jameela on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jameelajamilofficial/), she was being simply unbearable. It seems like she just discovered feminism, and is pushing it like a middle school tumblr girl from 2014. Everything is well-intentioned, but her execution of ideas is too cringe to handle. Im no feminist scholar, but in my opinion, her feminism is exclusionary, privileged, and ignorant. 

I did some googling and found I wasnt the only one who thought this. 

[So much of what Jameela J is doing or saying seems very much like she hasnt made the effort to see who is working on the issues she cares about. She lacks the critical analysis already explored by others and ends up harming people.""](https://twitter.com/Femmefeministe/status/1069576529112387585)

Some examples that personally ticked me off:

[A post of a plus-sized model](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrY1SrhFOSK/): I think shes beautiful - Um, how about just say shes beautiful, full stop? Instead of pointing out her size? Explaining that a fat person can be beautiful is not revolutionary, or particularly helpful. 

[I would like to put airbrushing in the bin. I want it gone. I want it out of here](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq5RdqMFxk8/?utm_source=ig_embed) Ok, Jameela, but you have a literally perfect face in that picture, and a skinny frame in real life. Feminism has much more pressing issues to address that arent about that. 

She describes herself as a ""feminist in progress"" which is great--we all are. However, it's not great that she's using her platform to spread these toxic ideas.

 - Eleanor: Deontology: (Returning the man's wallet out of ""duty."")

 - Chidi: Nihilism (Optimistic): (Life itself becomes meaningless when you can't do anything to change your fate. However, this allows you to discover yourself and decide your own meaning.)
 - Jason: Consequentialism (Giving away money to strangers in the park.)
 - Tahani: Virtue Ethics (Donating to the Opera House.)

After which, they regroup to become the soul squad, acknowledging that being around each other makes them become better people.!&lt;

Furthermore, I'd also add that we all have qualities of Michael and Janet as well. Both of which represent dualities or opposing natures:

What Im saying is my expectations are so high that almost nothing could be good enough because each episode is competing against the weight of the combined excellence of the prior 26 eps.

(Michael to Janet) ""I've really gotten into podcasts since we've started this. Did you know, the number one podcast in The Good Place is Mozart and Jimi Hendrix talking about music. And, the number one podcast in The Bad Place is Joseph Stalin recapping The Bachelor""

Of course, this is not canon event, as both Michael and Janet break the fourth wall. However, this joke is still intended to be humorous (as otherwise there's no reason to put this particular joke in). So why is it funny?

The punchline of this joke, of course, is the ending portion, that those in the Bad Place enjoy listening to Joseph Stalin recapping the Bachelor. This makes sense to be funny, as the Bachelor is established in the show as being morally evil. As Stalin is very historically condemned, it could be humorous to think of the Bad Place demons listening to such a podcast. However this joke relies on one thing. 

It has to be true. 

By this I mean, the number one podcast in The Bad Place must actually be Joseph Stalin recapping The Bachelor, or at the very least, such a podcast must exist in the Bad Place. 

""But so what?"" the dear critic of my post replies. ""So what if demons listen to Joseph Stalin?""

Well, the same logic applies to the other fact in the opening joke. After all, if it doesn't apply, then there is nothing separating this joke from some random joke made by a viewer. Therefore, in order for this joke to really be funny, it must also be true that the number one podcast in The Good Place is Mozart and Jimi Hendrix talking about music. Furthermore, this would imply that both Mozart and Hendrix are in The Good Place.

This idea had no problem for the first 9 episodes of the 3rd season, but creates a problem for the 10th episode ""Janet(s)."" In this episode, it is explained that no human has gotten into the Good Place in 521 years. 

Both Mozart (1756-1791) and Jimi Hendrix (1942-1970) clearly fall in this timespan. However, this is not necessarily a contradiction. After all, the concept of Jeremy Bearimy introduced allows for the show to nullify pretty much any timeline problem. In this case, this could be 521 years of Jeremy Bearimy time which could be thought of as whenever in history.

All this is to say that these facts are not necessarily in contradiction (yet).

However, it is well known that in an interview with critics, Michael Schur said that the 521 years are in reference to the time since European exploration in the 1400's. This removes any possibility of an explanation such as Jeremy Bearimy. This puts it in utter contradiction with the logic described here. 

In summary, in order for the joke at the beginning of the 3rd season of The Good Place: the Podcast to be funny, it must be true that the number one podcast in The Good Place is Mozart and Jimi Hendrix talking about music. However this is in contradiction with what Michael Schur said in an interview.

Therefore, one of the following must be true:

1. Michael Schur blatantly lied in an interview.
 (doesn't make sense and would have a lasting impact on his trustworthiness in further interviews)

2. Mozart and Jimi Hendrix are in the Bad Place, but the joke was still made.
(doesn't make sense because when this joke was written, the 3rd season must have been at least through the general writing process, which would mean that whoever wrote this joke should have known that they were canonically in the Bad Place and thus have used two people outside of the time frame for the beginning, less critical, part of the joke)

3. Mozart and Jimi Hendrix are in the Bad Place, but they are still making a podcast for the Good Place about music.
 (while this hypothesis is the most entertaining, it would overturn much of what we think about the Good Place [the angels must enjoy a podcast of these people being tortured])

All of these possibilities are either unreasonable or present a significant problem for the show. ",39,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

But I hope I'm Doug-Forcetting on this. But whatever here goes:

While making his case in front of the Good Place committee, Michael's gonna take a closer look in the Book of Doug and see that Elleanor's dad and Jason's dad (Doug Shellstrop and Doug Mendoza) both have a point total that is inexplicably close to Doug Forcett's. In fact, everyone in the book has the same score, within 5 to 10%. Doug is still an outlier but his score is only like 10% higher than the average points of all the other Dougs in the book.

It's pretty much guaranteed that the Book of Doug will be significant, as that's the title of the next episode and Michael made sure to take it with him and it was explicitly pointed out. And then why would there be two more minor characters called Dougs in this show? Can't be a coincidence.

More theory because why not:

Turns out that the Accountants really are doing a good job keeping track of the point value of every action. It's all flawless on that end. It's just that over 500 years ago, something changed, and now it doesn't really matter what you do or don't do, cause these ""actual free will points"" are only worth around 5% of your actual total, and the remaining 95% is all bad, bad stuff, in general. Basically, just being a human automatically makes you a scumbag. You live on stolen land, eat food that was grown in exploitation, the energy that provides your comfort is killing the planet, and everything you buy contributes to a whole system of exploitation. The morally correct thing to do would be to completely live off the grid and grow everything yourself, kinda like Doug Forcett, but even then, that's morally neutral at best! I can see points like ""You don't get a reward for not killing somebody"" and ""well everyone's guilty of something"" being used by the Good Place committee people. Then the gang turns to Chidi to make a case using moral philosophers who argue that people are a product of their environment and that all those ""de facto bad points"" shouldn't count. 

So even if you raise, like, a thousand dollars for charity or whatever, that's still not nearly enough to make it into TGP because you're still a human scumbag who partook in the destructive system, and it's basically impossible to not be a part of the system. The whole thing's forked up and it dooms all humans. I could even see something like one of the Bad Place demons helped out Columbus get to America because they know it'll lead to more de facto bad points for everyone on the long term.",11,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

When the last episode ended and they apparently ended up in the Good Place, it really reminded me of the (DISCLAIMER: Game of Thrones spoiler ahead!!!) Theon situation with Ramsay where he supposedly ""saved"" him just to bring him back to the cross.

What if the whole escape, with the judge, the years back on Earth and everything, is part of a really successful attempt? Michael figured out that the group would always find out that it is the bad place, so therefore he decided to implement it into his attempt. Here are some supporting notions:

* Right when they find out it's the bad place and do NOT get reset, they flee to Mindy and try to figure out what to do. Chidi then says: ""I think this is pointless, we are dealing with a warped version of Nietzsche's eternal reccurence"".

* The whole crew is mostly miserable throughout the whole escape. Even on Earth, they get followed by Demons, Eleanor finds out about her mother who changed, but wouldn't for her, believes everything is predetermined, Chidi temporarily falls into nihilism..
During the judge hearings, everyone but Eleanor failed their tests and Eleanor had to consciously decide not to go to the Good Place because of the others. Torture.

* In the last episode, when Michael says: ""Hey, you're all here. And you're safe!"" (Alarm goes off) ""... from the old scary situation.. now we're in a new scary situation""

So, if the series had not been renewed, I think they would've found out that they're ""back at the cross"", not in the Good Place in the next episode.

By Doug's own admission, the only reason he continues to do all of the things he does is in order to accrue enough points to get into the good place, however the show has already established in multiple cases that that doesn't work, because it's a textbook example of corrupt motivations.

Doug isn't doing the things he's doing because he cares about making the world a better place, he's just terrified of slipping up and losing enough points to send him to the Bad Place. Michael and Janet should know that, so I'm not sure why he continues to be held up as an example of a Good Person.",72,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I've been reading some of his books and came across this quote. This got me thinking of TGP and how static their system is. 


Humans have always tried to leave something behind even if it was just their genes... or jeans most likely in my case. Dante died in the 1400s and yet this very show still has ripples of his poem in it and then there are authors, movie directors and actors, something your great grandma told you when you were a kid and it stuck...etc
