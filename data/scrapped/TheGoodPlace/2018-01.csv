&amp;nbsp;

Profiles:

Eleanor Shellstrop -    
An only child. Arizona born &amp; bred.     
Petty and selfish    
Lacks empathy

Chidi Anagonye -    
Professor of ethics    
Wracked by indecision, paralysed by choice.    
Writes endless, confusing manuscript he believes is brilliant.

Jason Mendoza -    
Drug dealing DJ from Florida    
Below average intelligence    
Zero impulse control

Tahani Al-Jamil -     
International socialite    
Mega fundraiser     
Major family issues

&amp;nbsp;

Eleanor's torture:    
Tahani will seem perfect and flawless to Eleanor, causing her to feel inadequate.    
Chidi will point out Eleanor's mistakes and continually illustrate how much she needs to improve (which will never happen).    
Jason will cause Eleanor to live in fear that his impending public admission will send her to The Bad Place.

Chidi's torture:    
Eleanor will cause Chidi to live in an eternal ethical dilemma.    
Tahani will provide Chidi with the nightmare of a third option on top of the other two Eleanors.    
Jason will torment Chidi by being his exact opposite: stupid, impulsive and inconsiderate.

Jason's torture:    
Eleanor will frustrate Jason by trying to hold him back and control his behaviour.    
Chidi represents all the things Jason despises: intelligent nerds and the educational process at large.    
Tahani will heighten Jason's paranoia by throwing *numerous? enormous?* parties at their house &amp; parading him around.

Tahani's torture:    
Eleanor will get the attention that Tahani craves, both from Jason/Chidi and in public.    
Chidi will cause feelings of unrequited love for Tahani.    
Jason will make Tahani miserable by never talking or giving her the attention she craves. ",7,46,False,self,,,,,

10,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2018-1-4,2018,1,4,13,7o0o1o,self.TheGoodPlace,[SPOILERS] synthesis of some season2 theories/analyses (up through ep. 7),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7o0o1o/spoilers_synthesis_of_some_season2/,gay-chordata,1515041545,"Some people have suggested that the ""Good Place"" Bad Place is actually MICHAEL'S Bad Place, and maybe he is a human... My theory is, Michael is indeed who we are lead to believe he is - an architect for the Bad Place bureau - but after he initially fails, his boss decides that Michael should be tortured pre-retirement, without him realizing it. 

However, at some point, Michael realizes that HE is being tortured by having to secretly keep rebooting over and over to continuous failure + facing insubordination from Vicky and the other actors, and then being forced to obey someone who comes up with 'lame' forms of torture (ex ""just needles"").

(Furthermore, perhaps ALL the actors are being tortured by being assigned to this repetitive, unsatisfying job... but I digress.)

The bit that made me really consider all of this was in Existential Crisis, when Michael (after 'drunkenly' giving his 'birth is a curse' speech at the party) says to Vicky, ""Mi torture es su torture"" to which Vicky had a strange expression on her face. I wouldn't be surprised if Vicky had actually teamed up with Shawn to plot against Michael; after all, they both had motive against him when the first attempt failed (Shawn believes the whole thing to be a waste of time, whereas Vicky was bitter she didn't get to deliver her big monologue) ... 

I don't know, I just find it suspicious that 800 attempts would go by without Shawn being suspicious, or even Vicky being in control for weeks but not realizing what Michael is doing. Then again, Vicky is a lower level being than Michael, and while she is a great actress, she is shown to be incompetent at times. Who knows.

There IS definitely something deeper going on... I think it's also likely that Michael HAS purposefully been torturing 'Team Cockroach' even after he joined their team (and not just slipping into it like he claims he did with the Trolley Problem)... I'm honestly thinking more and more that he was faking the existential crisis/midlife crisis deal. Eleanor makes a good point, that wow, he's supposedly some sort of wise old superior being, but briefly hinking about death ONCE sends him into an utter tailspin? And then he like, gets drunk somehow and nearly outs Chidi and Eleanor with his antics at the party? Yeah, it seems suspicious... like it was all part of an elaborate form of torture. AND his apology to Chidi, in the Trolley Problem, seems supicious as well to me... Idk, I don't trust Michael at all now lol. AND FOR GOOD REASON; Eleanor said from the beginning that Michael was continuing to fork with them, just like she said some things at the beginning of season 1 that ended up being true (such as, Tahani is a condescending bench. And look how accurate and obvious that became!)

Sorry for such a long post! (I'm new here and have a lot of thoughts...) I binged the whole series the other day and I'm obsessed now, and I had to keep rewatching and analyzing parts!

I hope we get some good reveals in tomorrow's episode!

**TLDR; I think it's possible that Michael has been intentionally torturing the humans, on his own, since he joined their team, and/or Michael himself is being tortured by other member(s) of the Bad Place Bureau.**",3,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

Remember when Michael got the Good Place Janet? ""It wasn't even locked up."" Yeah, that's right, it was an eventuality that a Bad Place architect would try something like this, and the Good Place basically made her available - after all, they are going to need her to get there.

That romance is what lead to Janet taking them to the Medium Place, and ultimately, forcing the confrontation that let them realize where they were.

Jason was also the one that inspired Micheal to realize that his only option was to switch to Team Cockroach. His liaison with Tahani also directly resulted in the creation of Derek; a part of the puzzle that was instrumental in tonight's episode.

Jason was also the one to bring up Derek's name at the pivotal moment, thus setting the plan in motion.

Now, why am I bringing this up?

The Eleanor gang knows about the Bad Place. So if they want to live in the Good Place, they can't tell anyone. And I don't think the boss of the Good Place wants to take a chance, specificly when they are ""bad"" people. He will want them to forget.

So they will have a choice: Be rebooted and forget everything again, but go to the Good Place, or to keep running from the Bad Place.

So everybody except shawn, janet, and derick in the good place is a real person being tortured. Now why do I say this? Characters like Michael have shown emotion and anger toward their job in the good place. You can see all of the ""demon characters"" hatting their jobs. Michael Has shown that he cares for the group that we know if human so he cannot be a demon it would be against what the show has been saying the whole time. We do see that Micheal and the ""demons being actors"" hate doing the good place routine over and over again right at season 2 episode 1. Now if you say that Michael is a demon and I am overthinking, then read this: 1. Michael has a pattern that he hates failure and cannot control a big organization as in the good place. 2. he shows emotion when characters like Shawn and mostly Janet do not (I think that janet is just doing things like hating jason just to break up jason and thiamine.) 

So if anybody actually read this then can you share your thoughts on my theory.",2,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

So, when the episode first opens, Shawn tells Michael he is getting a massive promotion, which as Michael pretty earnestly says ""is all [he] ever wanted"".

Then during the comedy roast, Michael says ""Eleanor and I have a lot in common, now here's how you can tell us apart. [She] is a manipulative who's an expert at making other people miserable"", and when he gives the clue ""You're bad Eleanor, this is exactly the place you should be"", there is a closeup and a slight smile on his face.

At the end of the episode, when Tahani is excited they might actually get to The Good Place, Michael has a faltering, obviously-fake smile.

 
Now what I think will happen, is at the end of the season Michael -who as we know is gonna be promoted- will offer Eleanor to stay behind in The Bad Place with him and help him run the show.
This mainly hinges on the fact that unlike the rest of the human gang, Michael is an Eternal Demon who likes to torture who never really wanted to get to The Good Place because he didn't want to stay in The Bad Place, but because it was his escape route should Shawn find out what happened.

In addition to this, we didn't really see a moral improvement in Michael, he did just throw Vicky under the figurative trolley, but we did see him getting very close with the group, especially with Eleanor whom he actually had a long chat with just to chat.

Lastly, Michael is, or at least used to be, a very selfish person, and now he is conflicted because if he helps them get to The Good Place he can't stay and achieve his dream, but on the other hand he knows what the humans really want is to get to The Good Place and they are his friends now.


It only seems logical to me Michael would prefer to stay behind and be the big boss, and have his best friend do it with him.

---

This part is much more speculative and less supported by specific scenes and dialogue from the show, but by my own understanding of the characters.

While Michael did not actually show concrete moral improvement or a selfless willingness to improve, we did see it in Eleanor, who began her path as a selfish person only wanting to improve so they could improve their personal comfort, and ended up a selfless, caring, trusting person who wishes to improve because they think it's the moral thing to do. She is (in my personal opinion) the person to grow the most on the show.

Because of this, I think during the confirmed season 3 Eleanor will turn down Michael, and either leave for The Good Place and Michael will stay behind having achieved his lifelong goal, or compelled by the strong bond he has created with someone for the first time, and a human at that, Michael will somehow be redeemed and leave for The Good Place with Eleanor having finally improved and become selfless.

And except for Jason, all of them could dodge their death if they had enough time.

They're not going to get to go to the good place, imo. Or if they do, they won't be able to stay. But I could see them being given a second chance. They've shown that they are capable of changing, so what if they're brought back to the moment of their death and given a chance to continue from there?

However, we are already on the 802nd reboot, and according to the Attempt Log that briefly appeared in 2x04, each attempt is on average 6 months in length. So we might reasonably expect this to be about 400 - 500 years into the process of torture. 

Isn't this to be preferred by the demons? Even if the humans can't remember their past iterations of being tortured, they are still being tortured for a majority of each session, and likely at a more intense level than the regular physical tortures. To Shawn, shouldn't this still seem like a success even if it requires regular reboots?

People arrive and are told theyve been paired with their ultimate soulmates. Same as before, but Michael and Janet are paired up and both are now trying to act like humans. 

Possibly a new guest star plays the neighbourhood designer in the Real Good Place, someone to cast suspicion and cause conflict with the cast. 

One issue I see immediately is that Janet would be recognizable. I feel she still needs to be involved and Im not sure casting a character for Michaels soulmate is the way they would go. I dont know how they would resolve this, maybe Michael joins them in another context.

S02E09 Best Self&amp;nbsp;

Michael gets into a bind; Eleanor has an idea that leads Chidi, Tahani, Jason and even Janet to put their feelings on the line.&amp;nbsp;

S02E10 Rhonda, Diana, Jake, and Trent&amp;nbsp;

Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, Janet and Jason go to a place with *potentially lasting implications*.&amp;nbsp;
supporting cast: Val(from the bad place design center)&amp;nbsp;

S02E11 The Burrito&amp;nbsp;

Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani and Jason consider how much they have (or haven't improved); Michael must deal with the consequences of his recent actions.&amp;nbsp;
supporting cast: Manisha/Waqas Al-Jamil (Tahani's parents)&amp;nbsp;

For the last episode S02E12, I think I read somewhere that it was titled ""*Somewhere else*"" or ""*Some Other Place*""? I'm not quite sure. And I never found the synopsis for this episode. Although Imdb indicates the episode featuring Brittany,  Madison (Eleanor's roommates), &amp; Wallace (Eleanor's boss at the fake medicine company).&amp;nbsp;

From the supporting cast in E11 &amp; E12, we could only suggest the episodes will contain past plots in Tahani &amp; Eleanor's previous lives.&amp;nbsp;

From the ending of S02E08 ""Leap To Faith"" current status of everyone is:&amp;nbsp;

Vicky: trapped in a cocoon by Shawn&amp;nbsp;

Shawn: headed back, but will look for the four humans in Mindy's&amp;nbsp;

Other bad place crew: headed back, maybe to HQ&amp;nbsp;

Derek &amp; Mindy: at Mindy's, with cocaine &amp; sex&amp;nbsp;

Michael, Janet, &amp; the four humans: stayed in the fake good place&amp;nbsp;

---&amp;nbsp;

Here's my thoughts:&amp;nbsp;

The main problem for Michael now is to cover up the reason why the four humans are not at Mindy's, and where they are. As the ""bind"" goes, I'm not thinking about the Vicky problem, cause she's imprisoned now. The promotion may stir up the inner contradiction in him, if there's still evil in his heart - I bet he still does. And from the look on his face at the end of E08, I predict their trip to the real GP will be *arduous*. So E09 may focus mainly on Michael, and talking with Eleanor will eventually bring up a bold and *human* solution.&amp;nbsp;

E10 suggests that maybe the five are going to the real GP. But Michael is not in the mix, so the place they're going to is not available for Michael. On the other hand, four aliases in the title indicates that one of the five people (including Janet) is not using an alias. I'm suggesting Janet, because there's no need for aliases if they're going to the real GP. Otherwise, Janet has to be disguised as human, and an alias may be needed just like the four.&amp;nbsp;

E11 will show us the confrontation between Shawn (or someone with higher levels) and Michael, as well as judgment for the four people. The flashback will reveal another selfish aspect of Tahani (as with all previous flashbacks).&amp;nbsp;

As far as ""potentially lasting implications"" in E10 mean, I have another theory as I typed the previous two paragraphs. The four may go through a sort of purgatory, or tests, to verify their qualification into the GP. Thus leading to the consideration part of E11. Val's presence may indicate one of the following scenarios: (1) flashback of Michael; (2) scenes in the bad place design center, as they discuss the future of the four humans; (3) judgment of Michael, hosted by Shawn, which leads E11 including plots of Michael fighting against the decision of Shawn.&amp;nbsp;

But E12 *will* be a wild card. They could build a new place for the four (with Janet maybe?), or they could lead to the journey into the *real* GP (providing E10 is in purgatory).&amp;nbsp;

Just messy thoughts and not organized, and open for discussion.&amp;nbsp;

Think about a few points:
 How do you actually reboot a human, and yet need to dissect their brains to study their memories? It seems inconsistent, as of the last episode. It suggests that Eleanor and the gang arent really human anymore. Theyve died and its their souls that are being tested.

 One philosopher said something like not everyone has the same starting/initial conditions. Some people are born into rich families and do good in life thanks to that in large part. Its unfair to compare them to a homeless person that stole loaves of bread to feed himself and his family. Its therefore unfair to go to Heaven or Hell eternally. Instead, you get either one for 1000 (I think?) years depending on how life went and then youre gone.

 Why would it be fair to judge actions alone, rather than your principles? Eleanor had a bad upbringing and so she behaved in a certain way due to psychological conditioning. Not her fault.

 Instead, lets test the very core of a person. A true psychopathic serial murderer doesnt deserve to go to TRGP. If they dont show remorse when stuff happens or own up to accidents, etc. thats a reason to go to TBP and so on.

 In the end: everyone gets another shot to prove themselves and wherever they go is where they deserve to go. TGP is like a simulation/entrance exam to see if you qualify for TRGP or TRBP.

The twist is that its not a simulation designed to prove something thats already established theoretically. Its not like rolling a die and seeing thats it a fair die in the long run (distribution isnt skewed one way or the other). Its running the experiment, seeing what happens and then going from there to make the decisions.

Why make it so elaborate? Well, remember when Michael set up The Trolley Problem: that was like a literal simulation. Except he said that their pain is real, but the people arent real. Its confusing, but we *specifically saw* Michael teleport Eleanor and Chidi in an instant to a trolley, a hospital and he was about to generate a volcano and a cute dog, etc. Where else could you do that but in a simulation? The answer is staring us in the face, really: Michaels abilities give him away. Where else could you destroy the second floor of a house with the snap of your fingers (Tahanis house with the doctor)? Again, a lot of things are pointing to a simulation.

The only thing is that saying its a simulation sounds lazy. TGP isnt a show that goes for lazy and Im hoping they take this idea further than I have one season one day!",12,18,False,self,,,,,

His characters are always a little comedicly over the top and on the nose for my sensibilities.  He is like a weirdly human comedy robot.  I can *feel* that he is funny, and yet I don't laugh.  I'm even a little squicked out like he's showing me the uncanny valley of comedy.   

_S02E07 &amp; 08 spoilers below._

So my initial reaction to Derick, what feels like a million years ago in episode 7, his eponymous episode, was a little sour.   He was funny. It was good.  But I was worried.   

But in episode 8 Derick's role really works out.  And he become such a valuable, maybe long-term side-character.   He is practically playing a comedy robot!  He is perfect.   

I have rewatched the same 20 seconds near the end of the episode about 30 times now  (19:50-21:10 in my copy.  From ""all aboard"" to ""maximum Derick"").   I laugh hysterically every single forking time I watch it.  

The Good Place is usually dry funny.  But it's not always laugh out loud funny.   That 20 seconds is constant laugh out loud funnny.  It's pure comedy ~~gold~~ Derick.    ",18,51,False,self,,,,,

I knew the Good Place wasn't actually good, I just thought it was tone deaf writing instead of clue it was all a trap.

How are they ever going to justify a Good Place that passively allows people to be tortured, rejects people at an arbitrary cutoff (death here is very arbitrary), judging people by moral standards they have no idea they even have to comply with (I would look at the world, in and of itself, and say there is no morality to be had so it's better to be the tyrant than the oppressed). I mean, I even fear bad for Columbus, because treating heathens like that was.....pretty much expected. They were not Christians and therefore beyond the realm of law.

He was rather firmly right as he understood it, to do what he did. There is a problem in judging people by a standard they do not know about nor do they have any reason to believe it to be the true way even if you told them. It's one thing to seal Columbus in the Bad Place if he would CONTINUE to do those horrible things, quite another to punish him for transgressions he now knows to be wrong.

From the concept, it seems no one is interested in repentance and change. And if these four are the first to bring this up, well, that would be tone-deaf writing. It seems that if the writing is going to be as good as it has been, it seems the only answer is that Michael must be absolutely wrong about how the sorting process works.

Or is there something else I'm not thinking of?",19,6,False,self,,,,,
156,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2018-1-15,2018,1,15,13,7qhfjf,self.TheGoodPlace,my thoughts on Michael and shawn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7qhfjf/my_thoughts_on_michael_and_shawn/,rose_the_wolf,1515992172,"**Michael** - *Who/What is he? What does he want?*  

I keep thinking about Michael's purpose and his motivations. Let's racistly suppose that he is a demon and he's telling the truth about everything. As we saw in the flashback, he always wanted to design a neighborhood where humans were tortured emotionally and not physically. *Side note: Why? He's the only one who seems to want this. The other demons at most show intrigue in the idea, but the majority love physical torture. Even with Vicky in charge, they reverted back to physical torture by sticking a bunch of needles in Chidi and calling it acupuncture. Anyway...* As he said in the recent episode, accomplishing this new type of neighborhood is all he ever wanted. He says it out loud to Shawn. Then if that was his one true goal, why would he put that at risk with no hesitation in order to save his human friends? Here are my thoughts:  

When he initially decided to help the humans, it was solely to save himself. He was worried about ""retirement"" I think he called it (where he would be essentially killed and cease to exist. He had a whole existential crisis about it). I feel like at that moment, when he realized that he could die, his character transformed and he went from being a demon with no compassion or fear of consequences to a mortal being, very human-like, who feared his own demise. This fear and change of values caused him to re-define his goals (survival, not torture), which lead him to care about Chidi's class, which caused him to actually learn morality. Also take into account that this guy is obsessed with humanity. He loves human stuff. So it kinda makes sense that he would slowly start to emulate one. But I feel like that moment when he came to grips with his potential impermanence is where he changed, he went from being cold-hearted to caring about his actions and realizing that they mattered because his life mattered to him. Now he loves his human friends and I feel like it's because he wants to be one of them. He wants to be good now.  

Then again, [this article kind of throws me off](http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/the-good-place-michael-schur-season-2-premiere-interview.html) because the creator Michael Schur says that Michael's character is named after [an archangel who weighs peoples souls and decides whether their souls are good or bad.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel)) Actually if you read that Wikipedia link, they say that Michael was like the ""advocate"" and savior of people and was mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Quran. Michael said that all religions got it 5% right, maybe he's part of that 5%? And maybe he's not conscious of his role, so what I said before is still true - he is a reformed demon who is the advocate and savior of the four humans. It is interesting how people bring up that he was able to find a Janet so quickly, so it wouldn't surprise me if he really was an undercover angel but I like the idea of him being a demon with the capacity to change (just like Eleanor did).

**Shawn** - *What's this guy's deal?*  

This guy is a huge question mark to me. I really don't buy any of the things he says - for example, can we talk about how he pulled Mike into his office to be like, ""Your neighborhood is a huge success! The humans are exhibiting the same (or maybe it was more) levels of torture from this experience."" Um, how did he measure that? And also, no they're not! This dude talks about people having their skin ripped off of them and stuff in the real bad place. Sorry, anxiety sucks but it's not as mentally anguishing as having my skin ripped off. That's a fact.  

Either the writing for this character isn't good and they need him to say unbelievable things to help push the story along, or he's not who he says he is. Maybe he's a double agent like others suggested, secretly working for the real Good Place to help bring more humans there or whatever. I don't know, does anyone have any ideas?",4,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

I don't remember which episode it was [EDIT S01EP13 MICHAELS GAMBIT] but I remember that when Shawn first turned down Michael's plan was because in his knowledge humans were really reticent about torturing each other. At first I chalked it up to writing and needing someone to be dubious  about Michael but weirdly it stuck with me. Ok, as others have said before there's something really not moral about having a good place and bad place organised like this, and it's deeply unfair that people like chidi, tahani etc should be condemned to eternal torture - something they don't deserve. But, after all some people are perfectly capable of torturing each other. We've done horrible things to each other while on Earth like enslaving, committing genocide and eradicating civilisations plus the universe of the Bad Place should be a place effed up enough to drain a person (even a normally flawed one) into obedience and cruelty (just think about the milgram experience or the stamford experience, while their execution can be frowned upon they still show that people are capable of stepping out of a preconceived normal zone). So you'd expect that some people in the Bad Place would be down for that. 

So, the fact that the people in the bad place believe humans aren't capable of following simple orders makes me believe that: 

-there are significant differences in the psyche between devils (BP employees) and humans (michael is the one more capable of understanding them tho) 

- people in the bad place still hold a lot of mental autonomy (they might need it after all, they do endure some rudimentary form of psychological torture like having philosophers wake up in a strange class naked or something like that) and even a sense of morality for not torturing their fellow humans. 


So people in the bad place are capable of some form of tacit civil disobedience and this makes me seriously wonder about what kind of person goes to the good place ...

I think when they finally end up at the judge he will make a compromise. He will send them all back to earth right before their easily avoidable deaths to give them one more chance to prove they are good people. The judge will also give Michael a chance and send him back as a human. Everyone will have their memories wiped, but Michaels wont actually get erased.  He will assume this is a mistake because he was a demon and something went wrong. Michael will try to help everyone else become good because hes actually their friend. This will  bring everyone together after Michael explains what happened. At the end we find out that The judge had Michael keep his memories on purpose to see if a demon really could become good. 

I like this theory because we get to once again get to see the shitty versions of everyone which are usually the best (funniest) ones. Michael is at his best when hes complaining or over excited about being human so it would be great to see him actually be one in the real world. I also hope they still cant curse and that actually is a mistake left over from the bad place. It would be a great way to have them finally believe Michael and keep one of the best reoccurring jokes.

What are humans actually being used for?
Earlier in season 2, Michael said ""I'm basically an exterminator, and you all are basically cockroaches,"" Implying that the best humans are being singled out and the rest are being tossed like imperfect produce. This implies that the best of humanity are being collected for SOME reason, while it's apparently important that anyone who didn't make the cut is tortured for all eternity. 
The Demons seem happy to torture, but never ask why they're doing it. Chidi suggested that the reason Michael was having such a hard time understanding ethics was because he was immortal, and therefore didn't have to face consequences. This means that ""Angels"" would probably share that mental state, though, and we know that can't be possible because if ""Angels"" were just as immoral as demons, the Good Place would be an impossibility. So I'm guessing Demons were designed to torture imperfect humans by whatever power controls the whole thing. 
This also leads to another conclusion I've been ending up on which is that humans are apparently even more immortal than demons. We know that demons can be ""retired"", effectively killing them. But humans literally can't be killed. They're born on Earth, and depending on how they behave in their first cosmic stage, they spend the rest of eternity either in bliss or in damnation, but their timelines can't end. We've seen no indication that human spirits can be ""retired"". 
So why is it the Demon/Angel's responsibility to look after humans in the afterlife? What do they gain? Why does Michael say that they're 'exterminating' bad humans? What are the good ones being rewarded for?

At the museum, demons kept mentioning the ""bad"" stuff the humans did, in this way like, saying why the humans deserved their torture. Like, while we (probably) think of demons as evil, that they might torture someone whether they ""deserved"" it or not, I don't think we've heard anyone saying they want to torture someone ""good.""

Like, is the reason they only torture ""bad"" humans that those are the only ones they're allowed (by who?) to torture? Or do the demons actually value goodness?

The existence of the museum is also interesting. Michael didn't expect anyone to be there (and his fascination with humans is presented as unusual), but there is this museum of humans being douchey, while meanwhile the demons, who torture douchey people, also act super-douchey. Like, if the demons were humans, then one would assume they would end up in the bad place too, based on how they act. 

So, if not for that, one might assume that they're punishing people because they value goodness (that Real Good Place and Bad Place ""employees"" agree on who is good/bad, I mean, that they have the same moral guidelines), but since the Bad Place demons act just like douchey humans, maybe the museum is actually like, ""Look how awesomely bad these people are."" Do they think ""bad"" people are awesome, and they also think torture is awesome? Do the demons torture each other for fun too?

Did Real Good Place and Bad Place ""employees"" all start out with similar ideas of morality, and the Bad Place employees have just gotten horrible over time in a Stanford Prison Experiment sort of way?

Why would one design Bad Janets to be rude to demons? It really seems like Bad Place demons enjoy being treated badly, that they value badness. Are Bad Janets something stuck on them by Real Good Place employees (who I imagine might have felt superior to Bad Place employees even when it was all starting, if it all started with them being the same kind of being, with the same idea of good/bad, but maybe upper class angels got to work in the Real Good Place, and so they looked down on lower class angels who got stuck working in the Bad Place? That whole idea is sort of out of nowhere; why do any of them even need to work at all?) or have Bad Place employees chosen to be treated badly?

DJ Bad Janet definitely adds to the they-genuinely-like-bad-stuff idea, although it's also kind of like how many of my generation (I'm 34) ironically likes so much stuff that it's hard to know what one genuinely likes and what one ironically likes. Do Bad Place employees just ironically like bad stuff even though they don't morally value it?

Alternatively maybe it does exist but there's only like ~100 people there. I feel like a major point of the show thus-far is that no one is perfect, everyone has their moments of being terrible humans, and their moments of being honorable good people. Also toying with the idea that maybe since the numbers were so low in the Good Place that it has been taken over? Like there was one giant after life that was shared and the bad place took over?

And that will out the fact that Shaun's breaking the 'Medium Place' treaty, or whatever they call it.

And here's the killer ending: The Judge decides to look closer at what Upper Management is doing in The Bad Place, and finds all sorts of rule violations... Because let's face it: They're demons.

So the series ends with The Bad Place being temporarily shut down, and our heroes having to redesign it.

Utilitarianism takes the position that the right thing to do in any situation is the thing which produces the greatest amount of happiness and least amount of sadness in total.^4  So, for example, if the question is whether you should charity auction a lunch date with your sister/Banksy, a utilitarian would ask whether the total happiness produced by the money it raises, plus the happiness of the auction participants would outweigh your crushing sadness at being forever in her shadow.  If it does, then the bidding starts at $1 million.^2

* **Utilitarianism doesn't care *why* you do the right thing**

Tahani on Earth is the paragon of utilitarianism.  She raises $6 billion for charity, never taking a dime of it for herself.  We don't know specifically if she's raising for very good charities, but I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  Under a utilitarian theory, she's followed the rules very well.  She of course has petty and envious motives, but utilitarianism cares not one bit about motives.  You do the right thing, you're good.

* **Utilitarianism is purely forward looking**

Judgment about past actions is not a big thing in utilitarianism.  The entire utilitarian theory is about doing the right thing right now.  What you did in the past is irrelevant.  Punishment for past bad actions should only be done if it is expected to produce good future consequences.  So for example you'd want to imprison a young, healthy murderer to stop them committing future murders, but if they're old and disabled, there's no point to keeping them unhappy in prison so you should let them out.

The whole scheme of the good place and the bad place is very non-utilitarian.  Eternal punishment for being bad, especially when nobody knows it's coming and could adjust their behavior, is very much against the utilitarian ethos.

*  **But what if I frame someone's girlfriend for theft so my 48 person dance crew can keep their best pop-and-lock-er?**

Pure utilitarianism (called ""act utilitarianism"") does not say that any particular action is inherently right or wrong, it just depends what outcomes it produces.  So if the framing makes the dance crew members at least 1/47th as happy as it makes the girlfriend unhappy, then it's the right thing.

* **That seems rife for abuse, and like people could claim that throwing molotov cocktails was the best thing for their situation.**

Yes, that is a problem, which is why there's another theory called ""rule utilitatianism"" which says you should act by the set of rules which, if followed, produce the most overall happiness of any set of rules.  This makes it harder for someone to justify selfish things by a claim they're for the greater good, since you have to show that the rule you're acting by produces the most happiness.  So a ""no molotovs"" rule would probably be best, even if sometimes it lets you get out of a _really_ bad cocktail party.

^1 Also, I apologize for any errors in these posts, and invite corrections or helpful notes.  I did my undergrad in philosophy, and did a lot of classes and such in moral philosophy, but it's been a while so I'm kinda rusty and may mess things up.

^2 Utilitarianism doesn't count your happiness as special compared to other people's happiness.  So one crushingly sad and envious Tahani counts equally to one of several hundred people receiving significant benefits from charity.

^4 There is a closely related idea called ""consequentialism"" which says the right thing to do is that which produces the best consequences overall, but leaves unspecified what 'best' means.  Utilitarianism is basically consequentialism where 'best' is defined as happiness.",12,46,False,self,,,,,

227,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2018-1-20,2018,1,20,6,7rli1t,self.TheGoodPlace,The Wizard of Oz theory expanded,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7rli1t/the_wizard_of_oz_theory_expanded/,jeeco,1516395861,"So we've all seen the theories relating this show to The Wizard of Oz. There's countless references and parallels, most notably with the 4 humans. Eleanor as Dorothy, Chidi as the Lion, Jason as the Scarecrow, and Tihani as the Tinman. That's all good and well and I won't beat that dead horse.

There is one part of these theories that I disagree with and this is that Michael is actually Oz, which I can understand the thought behind this. He is the one that our main cast turns to as an answer to get them into The Good Place, he even crafts them a balloon to bring them there. But in that same episode we find out he does not have the power necessary to give the humans what they desire most, which is something that Oz WAS able to successfully offer the heroes.

But who DOES have this power? The Judge. The Judge has the power to get our heroes into The Good Place and The Judge is this mysterious presence who our heroes know of through tales from Michael, who as far as I'm aware is also not familiar personally with The Judge. We don't know much about this character yet, but I'm postulating that The Judge is Oz and is going to become a much bigger character during Season 3 (which I will get to later).

Now if Michael isn't Oz, who could he be? Well I'm placing him as Glinda, The Good Witch. Think about it, The Good Witch advises Dorothy to visit Oz when she hears of her plight, much like Michael urges the four characters to see The Judge in order to get them to The Good Place. During Dorothy's quest to reach Oz, her and her friends are tested time and time again by various obstacles that push them to their limits yet allow them to utilize the very thing that they lack. This is exactly what Michael does during each of his resets (although he is initially doing it out of the badness of his heart). With each reset comes new obstacles that the humans must overcome, yet each time they overcome it by using the very things that they believe they lack. And in the final reset Michael decides to guide them, acting as their Morally Ambiguous Witch. And if Michael is our Glinda, then we have to have a Wicked Witch who is directly related to Michael and who is out to foil our groups plan, and who better fits those shoes than Shawn? He's Michael's boss, meaning it is someone Michael knows intimately and has some information about which he shares with our heroes to protect them. Michael is constantly in pursuit of them, showing that he is and will continue to be a threat for our heroes. And he's the main antagonist, so that kinda puts him in that role anyway. So right now I'm saying Michael is Glinda and Shawn is The Wicked Witch of the West. And to further support this, Michael directly fends off Shawn in order to get the humans to The Judge, which, no doesn't happen in the original story, but the fact that Michael does not reach ""Oz"" with the main cast further strengthens the point that he is Glinda as she never sets foot in Oz and just assists the heroes on their journey.

As for the bearing that this has on the story, I'm thinking that each season is going to follow a different part of the story of The Wizard of Oz. My theory is that season 1 is Dorothy still in Kansas. Which I know is another point that goes against some of the theories I've seen. But think about it, this is the season that sets up our normalcy. This is the season where we find out exactly what type of world our characters live in. Kansas is ""The Good Place."" And the season ending with us and the characters finding out they are actually in The Bad Place, and this is the tornado sweeping them away to the land of Oz. Season 2 has been a parallel to Dorothy and Co. making their way to meet the Wizard in order to help them get what they need and to get Dorothy/Eleanor back where she (thinks she) belongs. I touched on the more specifics of this point when discussing Michael so I feel pretty confident with this thought.

Now what this means for the rest of the show? My guess is that they'll meet The Judge who will tell them they will need to, for one reason or another, take down Shawn due to the illegal acts we have been shown, in order to prove themselves worthy of moving on to The Good Place, much like The Wizard requesting Dorothy and Co. take out The Wicked Witch. Season 3 will be all about the war and them taking out Shawn and maybe even changing the way The Bad Place is run ala Monsters Inc? (As far as we're aware there's not rules saying there HAS to be a Good Place and a Bad Place being run exactly as they are, they just exist)

And that would lead to Season 4, the end of the book. In The Wizard of Oz, The Wizard offers Dorothy a balloon ride back home but she misses it and ends up stuck again in Oz. She is advised to visit Glinda once more for assistance and after a long, difficult journey, Dorothy and Co make it to Glinda and Dorothy is told how to get back to Kansas (""The power was in you the whole time,"" ""The real Good Place was in The Bad Place all along""). I believe that after taking down Shawn they will be presented with the opportunity to enter The Good Place but will choose to seek out Michael instead as he may have been imprisoned or he might have just resigned himself to a life of hiding or just chose to stay in The Bad Place for one reason or another. Regardless of the reason they will seek him out to either have him be put in charge of The Bad Place or in order to bring him to The Good Place with them. I'm not sure exactly what will happen during this part of the story or how exactly it will end given the show's twists and turns, but I have a feeling this is generally how the show is going to pan out in the future.

I don't know how much of this will be true, but I am confident in the comparison of Michael as Glinda and Shawn as The Wicked Witch of the West. If things will play out similarly to the books is yet to be determined. Hell, all of this can be thrown out the window the moment we are introduced to The Judge, but for the time being I think we're in for an even more wild ride and I have a feeling that these last two seasons have been primarily for world building for a greater story that will either take place in these next two seasons or even longer.

TL;DR Michael is Glinda, Shawn is The Wicked Witch of the West. The Judge is The Wizard of Oz and will request that the humans apprehend Shawn due to his misdeeds to prove their worth in The Good Place. They'll do it after many trials and tribulations, be offered a pass into The Good Place but turn it down to rescue/retrieve Michael.",6,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

Just think about it. He suggested to tell Shawn what Michael did in exchange of better treatment. Michael and Eleanor changed a lot to better, Chidi never changed even a few. And why he would be the only one to look like another demon? When asked a new way to torture, he told what he did to Eleanor. Also, he doesn't correspond Eleanor's love. (torture)

The writers don't let anything pass by, I think that that ""Trent"" history was a hint.

By the way, along the reboots, it passed kind of 300 years, the demons said the last time they saw Trent was 800 years ago. (And it was 802 reboots, kind of round number, maybe a hint?)

And, Michael and Eleanor are the only ones who changed to better.

Jason and Tahani didn't change also.

Remember when the show's creator said that the Relationship between Michael and Eleanor were closer than it seems?

Ps: till now, only Michael and Eleanor sacrificed themselves to save their friends, that's why they are the only ones who deserves the good place.

I'm fully prepared for my theory to be smacked off creation by someone. But, Jason is a demon. He's the only one who's remained hella stupid. Michael, Eleanor, Tahani, and Chidi have all shown to somewhat change. Michael and Eleanor being the most noticible. Chidi breaking out of his comfort zone and being ""bad"" during the party. And Tahani, well she was better when she was pretending. 

Jason hasn't changed at all, nor has he made any attempts to be good. It could be that he's just that dumb. So dumb he can't grasp anything, yet he can be smart at times. Like when he knew it was a prank show, sort of. The one time he was smart with the philosophy. Or when he threw the Molotov cocktail to get out of the party. It's not much, but he's remained pretty consistent.Even being the most relaxed at the hell party in the last episode. 

But why is Jason there if he's a demon? Pure boredom? He's a spy? No, it's all because of Janet. He called Janet sexy in the last ep. He probably still has feelings for her way deep down. And Michael stole a good Janet. Maybe this means Jason in from the good place and went to rescue his one true love, but got tangled up in Michael's new place. Or maybe he caught a glimpse of her in hell, and had to go find her. Because Michael didn't correct him on pretending he was going to work in Molotov Cocktail department. So he got that right off the bat. 

Now this is where the theory starts falling apart, because I got lazy. It doesn't explain why he can't just take her and go, because he'd know how to use Janet. Maybe he's just super dumb, and hasn't been able to think of that. Or the numerous reboots he's gotten stupider. Or...something else I dunno. 

Anyways, I think something is up with Jason. He just hasn't changed at all, and he deserves the bad place more than the others. He really hasn't done much at all to be good. Not that I can recall. 

EDIT: Holy forking shirt, I think Jason is from the good place. He hasn't done anything ""bad"" per se. Because he just can't do it, like Janet. Jason would know about the Molotov cocktail torture through the grape vine. I mean, he is in the good place, possibly. And he worked on the good Janets. The good Janet he liked was stolen, and he found out Michael took her, made up a fake name and backstory to gain entrance. He hinted at Elanor they were on a prank show, because it's in his nature to help/be good. For the keg stand/Molotov cocktail, maybe he just knew how to.

A universal judge would almost have to be out of time. They could have seen some glimmer of hope in Michael's neighborhood, maybe some doubt about the absoluteness of the scoring system. They could have watched it play out then gone back to the beginning and inserted themselves.

This ads in another ethical dilema, maybe the reason that Chidi has been neurotic. By inserting into the process, the Judge is actively influencing the outcome. But if it can prove that humans can be rehabilitated then maybe the ends justifies the means.",12,17,False,self,,,,,

However, I've realized that this is only true if you ignore the season up until Chapter 24. None of them are perfect, but they've all improved noticeably.

Chidi: The last couple of episodes have shown him only taking a few minutes at most to make decisions in very high-pressure situations, whereas before he needed hours of thought to make even minor decisions when stressed. Granted he usually needs some help from Eleanor first, but he's still clearly improving. He also had very little hesitation about agreeing to teach Michael ethics, contrasting with his hand-wringing about teaching Eleanor and Jason in the original reboot, whose immoral acts were a lot less extreme than Michael's.

Tahani: While she still brags a lot, she's more or less lost her condescending attitude towards Eleanor and Jason. And she's shown repeatedly that she can admit to having problems, something the original Tahani never did until the S1 finale. The whole arc of her relationship with Jason definitely shows her to be a considerably different person than she was in Chapter 1.

Jason: Yes, he's still an idiot, but he hasn't really done anything immoral in this reboot. The original Jason was perfectly willing to throw his friends under the bus for his own benefit, whereas the current one seems to be genuinely interested in helping the rest of Team Cockroach. When Michael showed them the hot air balloon thing he was willing to stay in The Bad Place until Chidi and Eleanor could get on instead of just trying to leave without them.",14,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

But one question that hasn't been really answered is- why are they taking their Janet with them? Obviously she's a main character so she needs to be around, plus others have grown connected to her. But should they get to the good place, they would have their own Janet. And it was shown previously that once Janet leaves her neighborhood, she's not the all-powerful siri god she once was.

I honestly didn't think they would take Janet through the portal, until Micheal made the (admittedly funny) joke about her being a carry-on (""I'm luggage!""). If they get to the judge and make their case, what would they say of her? After all, Micheal STOLE her from the neutral zone in the first place.

It's very possible the judge just says ""whatever, take her, who cares"". But what I hope happens is there has to be some sort of appeal to keep her on the grounds of her and Jason being in love. This would be a great opportunity to develop her arc with Jason, and provide a heartfelt moment for two characters that get less plot attention.

It could also happen that the judge says she can't come. Maybe they sneak her away, maybe they have to say goodbye, maybe something I haven't even thought of. But I would be very surprised if this isn't even brought up next episode (or, I guess, by the end of the season).",22,15,False,self,,,,,

-the judge sends them to the real bad place and Michael is to be retired, they escape and try to rescue Michael

-the judge is now faced with a large moral dilemma and needs to bring it to a board, or discuss with higher ups, leaving them in limbo

^side guess Eleanor pitches some sort of moral paradox that creates this, Tahani pitches that there has to be someone higher up than that, Eleanor capitalizes on the judges fears like she
Does with Michael in season 2

Plot trajectory/end prediction

-the humans reveal the inconsistencies of the system and note that they can't use a point system that places people between the good and bad place.

Eleanor is bisexual (i mean not really a headcannon, more canon). I know straight women that acknowledge that other women are attractive though and we don't see her dating any women in her lifetime but I'm sure she's bi. She's down for swinging with that one couple. It could be considered self preservation but still.

Mini not so mini theory- this is their very complicated way of proving themselves to get to the good place. This is the fire that they walk through so to speak.

Eleanor is supposed to make Chidi anxious because he has to keep the truth that Eleanor belongs in the bad place a secret, and Tahani was miserable because she couldnt talk with Jason (Jiyanu), making their relationship not-reciprocal. The reason that this plan failed is because Eleanor took Chidi classes and made themselves better people, and they managed to solve the conflict that was the Tahani-Jason relationship.

Had Michaels plan worked, these four humans would be torturing each other for centuries to come. But since it didnt, he managed to twist the original plan into the new situation that was created with Eleanor revealing herself: He brought Vicky to act as the Real Chidis soulmate, making him completely confused about who he should spend eternity with, and causing unrest among Eleanor, Tahani and Chidi all at once.

We can also see how this soulmate stuff was used to torture people latter in attempt two: Chidi gets bamboozled about his double soulmate decision, making him nervous as hell, Jason is tortured with his new Buddhist pal, Eleanors hot soulmate is just a distraction to make her not realize the truth about The Good Place, and worse of all, Tahani is forced to live in a small house with ONLY ONE FLOOR (GASP)!!

So yeah, every time someone is assigned a Soulmate, there is always a cruel reasoning behind said decision.
But wait, (You, the redditor, suddenly asks) if there is no soulmate, how come Tahani and Jason/Chidi and Eleanor got together if theyre not supposed to be soulmates?

Easy: They socialized with each other, found out that they had attributes they liked in each other, became inseparable friends who needed to stay together against terrifying odds, and realized they really liked each other. Theres also the lack of options there too (4 humans in a devil neighborhood) but come on, they started their romantic relationships just like we do here in real life.

So yeah, I think this Soulmate deal is a total lie created by Michael to torture people.

But watching the aforementioned made me see a pattern in setting, character and a little humour? 

The shows have an office setting and tend to have: 

* A character that is generally mocked and belittled (Kevin, Jerry, Scully &amp; Hitchcock)

* A stern boss-figure (Ron Swanson, Captain Holt)

* An Indian character that is very deep in American culture and Hip-Hip (Kelly and Tom)

* A flawed but persistent protagonist who gets things done (Leslie, Jake)

* An outsider with a low rank (Ryan, April, Gina)

and i think i made my point, but The Good place manages to have really engaging character archetypes never before seen in a completely different environment and you feel the Michael Schur in the quality of the show but it took such a wild direction and it paid off so much with the great visual gags, situational humor and philosophy.

You could watch tgp as a show within a show. What i mean is that the fake good place is a setting for the ""show"" that michael (also the first name of the writer michael schur) wrote, in which the main characters have to maneuver around awkward situations. Just like in a sitcom!
Like in sitcoms the 4 characters are very different from each other. And for those people michael (the demon) wrote basically a show also with him as an actor in it. Also the other people in the fake good place are basically actors. He also once said this torture/show could last thousands of years/seasons. 
He also had to pitch the idea to the executives of the bad place just like a writer pitches his ideas for a sitcom to network executives.
Where im going with this is that maybe this show is semiautobiographic and is about michael schurs idea of showbusiness/sitcoms. the other demons just want to torture the humans always in some really generic way but michael (the demon) tries to be creative and do something outside the box just like michael schur who is trying to create something very unique like this show within the sitcom genre.

But my interest in whether it was heaven/hell started in the very first episode. When Micheal is explaining to Eleanor who ""got it right"" in terms of religion, he says that every major religion got it about 5% correct. Except, of course, for the one stoner kid.

This seems like complete bullshirt. Maybe Micheal was lying to Eleanor (maybe Doug never existed), but that seems like it would be pointless. So assuming he's telling the truth, where are the other religion's 5%? Because I see no hints of any religion except basic Christian belief.

I could be wrong but I believe that Christians (and Muslims?) are the only ones who believe in a Heaven and Hell type afterlife. Buddhists, Hindus, they don't have anything like it. I believe Judiasm has no specific hell, even though they're generally similar to the structure of other Abrahamic religions...

So what happens in the show, ever, to imply that any religion is influencing this afterlife besides the Christian ideas of heaven and hell? My guess is that they just threw in that joke about all religions being ""right"" because they didn't want to make the show about religion. But wouldn't there be plot implications considering they're not making it a little more transparent that it's actually heaven and hell?

Here are some reasons why they shouldn't be allowed in the good place.     
**1. None of them were good in life.**     
Eleanor lived a life of only thinking of herself and never caring about the consequences of her actions. Tahani's motivations were corrupt. Jason had no inhibitions in violation any sort of law. Chidi caused people around him to suffer because of his inability to act.    
**2.Purgatory doesn't seem to exist**     
None of them have atoned for their sins on earth. They may have been in the good place for hundreds of years, but with constant memory wipes there ""real"" time is only a couple of months. A couple of months is nowhere enough time to fully counter a literal life times worth of mistakes and habits. Sure when pressured with eternal damnation they might put on a good farce of acting good, but 2 days in real ""Good"" place is going to have them back to their old ways. Tahani will still be name dropping while hosting a new party. Chidi will still have issues of making any decision at all. Jason will still performs activities deemed worthy of going to the bad place. Eleanor might have changed some, but I am not convinced that an inconvenience down the line or a harsh flashback will cause her to lose all her progress.      
Michael mentioned in the first episode that only the most amazingly good can get in the real ""Good"" place. Even if they attoned for their sins on earth, essentially negating the bad stuff, would they have enough points to satisfy this high requirement?     
**3. Mindy St. Claire ruins the idea of redemption, and nothing done in the afterlife matters**    
Essentially Mindy is in the Medium place because the amount of good and bad she did essentially ""cancelled"" each other out. We can also believe that they canceled out in a way that made her a candidate for neither the good or bad place. Think of a score of less then 10,000,000 points gets you in the bad place, and a score greater than 10,000,000 points gets you in the good place. She finished life with a score of exactly 10,000,000.  They created an entirely new place just for her because it only happened to her. Why does this doom the four crew? Well essentially, if anything mattered in the afterlife in determining the fate of an individual then the medium place wouldn't exist at all in the long run. They could have easily monitored Mindy for a hundred years to gather more information about her in order to determine which place she belongs for eternity. Given enough time (data) Mindy's good/bad nature will eventually become apparent even if smaller sample sizes still give an indifferent response. The four is essentially screwed because they don't allow post life good/bad monitoring to determine a salvation and damnation.    
Can you imagine if they allowed post life point determination? The slightest drift toward the otherside would eventually lead to a change in fate when we consider probability given a time span of eternity. If the not-good four can do good acts in the afterlife, what stops the ""good"" from accruing  enough negative points to go to the bad place? The moral rules of the universe were never clearly explained to the four. What would give us any indication that they have been explained to anyone else without prompting? Enough flossing after dinner in the communal lounge will eventually send anyone to the bad place given a finite life span and points, i.e. no infinite point scenarios for curing aids, righting the wrongs of the apartheid and so on. 

**Random thoughts**    
Without question, Jason is unfathomably dumb. Should he be held accountable for his actions were he clearly doesn't understand the consequences of his actions?     
All religions got ""it"" wrong, then what reasonable being would hold people accountable to a moral code or standards for actions they clearly don't fully understand or know that exist?   
I don't understand for the need to push a Tahani/Eleanor relationship. Clearly it is a running gag in the show and nothing more will come out of it. People point to the 0.5 second flash referencing soul mate action in season 2 should also remember Eleanor was paired with a dog, and Jason was paired with a ""twin"" soul.     
It's interesting that given enough time demons (Michael), Angels (assuming equivalence), and Janets can eventually cease to exist, but there have been no mention of how humans can permanently disapear.    
If the pancakes at IHOP devour people, then would Michael suggest of ""getting some"" in the latest episode?

They will go through many troubles and finally see the judge in E12. The judge will give them a test or mission that requires self sacrifice. They passed the test.

They finally agree to build a place called somewhere else as a temporary place for the four. The judge will hear their case again in 100 years.

The bad place takes Michael away. 

Eleanor will sacrifice herself in order to save Michael from eternal retirement. she leaves the group in secret and follows the demons and Michael to the bad place.

Janet is going to be recycled by the good place because she is malfunctioning and too advanced. Jason will risk his life trying to save her.

To create ""Good Place"" neighborhood Michael had to get a Good Janet. How to get a Good Janet? You have to go to a Janet warehouse and as we seen in last episode, portal is through judge's court. So even if it wasn't suspicious that some demon come to get a Janet, it was when he took the good one. This surely caught judge attention.
We can assume that judge don't like to show herself to incomers, or even she likes to test or play with them in some way, like it was with burito. So in my opinion she was aware of what Michael was doing.

We don't know how Michael chose those 4 humans or how humans are evaluated to see where they fit. Judge has the final word of where humans are going and maybe she somehow pick those 4 humans for Michael?

Just think how this season will end. Our humans, Michael and a judge. The same setting as in the first season! There will be a plot twist in next episode... but, not about their current position, but about how ""Good Place experiment"" was arranged.

I suspect that in our group one of people wasn't meant for Bad Place. Who it was? I suspect that only Eleonor should be in a Good Place. It would pretty much ingenious, since the whole show started with the premise that she don't belong in ""The Good Place"" which now it might have other meaning, since ""The Good Place"" was a Bad Place neighborhood.

Judge might go along with Michael plan out of boredom. Why would she framed a picture of random people to a wall? As far as we know only really groundbreaking events are immortalized in afterlife.

This all fits together so well that it can't be a coincident. Next episode will be about judge explaining of her role in all of this.

And what about ""Somewhere else"". Well, she can't send them to the real Good Place, but since they have a Janet and architect in their group, they can make their own neighborhood in the boundless void. Or there are other places beyond Good and Bad?

One more thing. Judge said that she can't send them to a ""Bad idea place"" in a manner that this place really existed. The important thing is that there are things that judge can't do, so maybe there's someone higher than Gen?

To me, it seems that going back to the Bad Place (real or fake) doesnt necessarily allow for a lot of room to write. Michael has burned his bridges, and with our characters knowledge of the Bad Place known to all you have to either a) wipe all memories again or b) put them in the real Bad Place. Erasing memories would just be a retread of season 1, and the actual Bad Place would be tough to portray (all demonic torture on the show is only alluded to or briefly described for a joke).

I think its more likely the cast DOES get to the real Good Place, but context is important. I think the Judge doesnt change her mind in the finale and still condemns them to the Bad Place, but in some manner the cast succeeds in getting to the Good Place anyway (Michael included), albeit secretly/illegally.  They now need to hide/fake their way in the real Good Place until they earn their actual right to be there.

Its a parallel to season 1, while still mixing up the formula somewhat and allowing for different character interactions (ie interacting with actual Good Place people).  Thoughts?",15,31,False,spoiler,,,,,

[Part 1, on utilitarianism, is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/7rjbfu/philosophy_friday_utilitarianism_or_why_tahani_is/)^1

So let us once again gather round Chidi's chalboard and get ready to give his favorite lesson.

---

Deontology is a moral philosophy which traces its roots to a number of sources, but the most prominent is surely the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.  

* **Deontology is focused on motivation, not outcomes.**

Deontology is almost a mirror opposite of utilitarianism in this respect.  Utilitarian or consequentialist theories are solely concerned with outcomes as opposed to motives.  Deontological theories are the opposite, and exclusively concerned with acting for the right reasons, even if it may not always produce the ""best"" outcome.

So if you're helping people out by holding the door at the fro-yo place, but it's only because you're trying to selfishly earn points to be allowed in the Good Place, that doesn't really count as good.

* **Kant's ""categorical imperative"" is one of the most famous rules regarding motivation.**

Kant's most famous rule is this nugget of forking impenetrable language:

&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.^2

So what he's saying here is that you should only act by rules of action which can be universalized.  So: ""what if everyone followed that rule?""  

This is where Chidi gets his big stick up his butt about lying.  Kant is clear in his writings that things like lying to get out of a bad spot, or breaking your promises when they become inconvenient, are not rules that you could want everyone to follow.  So they're against the rules.

* **Deontology is also what's up with the Doctrine of Double Effect when they wanna kill Derek.**

Chidi has a major freakout when Michael and the rest of the gang want to kill Derek, who is totally gonna get them caught. Killing, as we have been told, is a moral no-no in Chidi's deontological world.  However, because Deontology is concerned with motivation, it can be OK to kill if your motivation is purely to do something in compliance with the rules, and the killing is a necessary side effect of compliance with proper moral thinking.  But if your goal is killing, then that's not cool.  So when you wink, or even worse _say the word wink,_ you are not following the rules!

* **But, so *why* is killing a moral no-no in this system?**

One of the other most well regarded deontological rules is that you should treat other people as ""ends in themselves,"" and not a means to an end.  This means that you have to treat them as moral entities whose goals and motivations and happiness are just as important as yours.  So if you do something which harms their wellbeing, even to benefit the wellbeing of yourself or others more, you're treating them just as a means to that end of bettering your wellbeing.  Killing someone is pretty clearly against their ends, and killing them for some ancillary benefit is therefore treating them as a means to that end, and not treating them as ends in themselves.

* **This seems really rigid and like it doesn't account for a lot of possible situations.**

It does, doesn't it!  It can produce a lot of stomach aches.  But the best defense of it is that without meaningful and tough rules, we're likely to end up poorly justifying anything we want in a game of calvinball.

^1 As I said in part 1, I am not a true expert in these subjects.  I did my undergrad in moral philosophy, but it's been a while, and I'm not active in academic philosophy today.  If I make any mistakes I ask that people point them out so I can correct them.

One school says that the purpose of punishment is to reform people (and is often against the death penalty/harsh prison conditions for this reason). The other school says that the purpose of punishment is revenge, an ""eye-for-an-eye"" sort of mentality. This is a massive oversimplification, but whatever.

I tend to go on the ""reform"" side a lot of the time. For this reason, the concept of hell doesn't make a lot of sense. The torture has no purpose. It just is. There is no way to ever get any mercy. You will never get to change. For eternity. That is an incredibly harsh punishment. Even if you err on the side of ""revenge,"" I think there are very few things that you can do on Earth that would make you deserve burning in hell for eternity. In addition, the torture is sort of purposeless, again. The people who you have hurt and want revenge aren't the ones who get to see it, the only things that ""enjoy"" it are the demons who are torturing you. 

From the Good Place perspective...Eleanor is very rude and selfish, Chidi is indecisive and causes people pain with his actions, Tahani does good things for the wrong reasons, Jason is a thief. Would anybody actually say that these people deserve to be tortured until the end of time because of these things? Jason is the only one who would actually be subject to human punishment.

I thought that it was fascinating when Michael said that they had been REFORMED and that they deserved to go to the Good Place because of it. He is quickly rebuked, because that's just not how it works. I think that this scene, and the show as a whole, works as a critique of the very concept of how hell works in various religions. I am curious to see whether the Good Place and the Bad Place are actually ""reformed"" themselves and changed because of these ideas. ",6,16,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's a brilliant and funny exploration of the philosophy of ethics, but this one thing is starting to really bug me- it's been pointed out a couple of times by the show that the afterlife system shown is terrible for two reasons: 

1.  It condemns people for fairly minor things (in Chidi's case for a possible mental health issue, which is even more disturbing) 

2. People can change after they die, so making them stay in the same place forever is wrong.

However, the show has totally failed to address a third problem: Humans are inherently finite beings, and therefore are incapable of infinite good or evil. But they get punished or rewarded infinitely. This seems utterly bizarre, especially since the system seems to determine goodness mathematically (admittedly, the mathematical nature of the judgement system does come from Michael, who wasn't the most reliable source, but he mentioned losing points after he joined Team Cockroach.)

Also, with regard to point 2, when Michael points out that this particular situation is unfair because ""they've become good people"", he doesn't make the leap to considering that if one situation in the afterlife can be unfair, it indicates that there are issues with the whole system. It's odd, as the characters constantly acknowledge that their situation is unfair but never seem to make the jump to ""the system is a whole is wrong"", apart from when Eleanor argued that there should be a Medium Place, which there is.

I just find it frustrating that though the unfairness of what counts as good or bad is pointed out in the show, the fairness of the reward or punishment being infinite and eternal is never brought up, ad for such a philosophical show, it really feels like it should.

Sorry if this is incoherent, I'm ill.

Not a real theory.

Ok, so picture this: It's the show's finale. We're all waiting for some crazy twist, and lo and behold, Michael gets up to speak. 

""Humans, you've come this far. I have to tell you something. It's ok, you won't remember it."" 

The humans get wide eyed. Is he going to erase their memories again? Is he still evil, is this still torture??

""When you die, before deciding where you go we're given a brief summary of your life. The really benchmark moments."" 

(Someone asks if they saw them losing their virginity, Michael assures him that only the Bad Place demons watch those ones. It's not too reassuring) 

""But what we really watch for is the best moment of your life. The moment in which you feel as happy and fulfilled as your tiny mortal bodies can."" 

We flash back. The dull colors let us know it's an earth flashback, a la season one.

Tahani is in one of those escape rooms, the ones people go to with friends or as team building exercises. Her sister is there, as are a bunch of celebrities or socialites. They're all over analyzing a puzzle the point of making it make no sense. Kamila is explaining ""how it works"" when Tahani realizes that they're all too obsessed with themselves to see how it actually works. She solves it quickly, and continues to be the MVP of the escape room. For that hour she's the most valuable member of the group, her sister is relegated to being a mere follower. 

NEW FLASHBACK. Chidi is in a different escape room with some professors he works with. They all make fun of him for not being able to choose what to do. Eventually, they make a decision that would not fly morally in the real world. Chidi resists, and they say that it's an escape room and therefore he doesn't need to be so uptight. In a rare moment of decisiveness, he outright does the morally right thing and prevents them from doing theirs. Surprise! It was a double-trap, Chidi's decision was right. For once in his life his morality helped him make the right call.

NEW FLASHBACK: Jason is in an escape room. His friends kind of wandered in, none of them are paying to be there, but whatever. They kind of get the gist and are having fun. Jason suddenly see's a bottle on a table and gets an idea: molotov cocktail! He scrounges up the supplies and blows the door off the escape room. Sure they get ""arrested"", but they technically won! He did it!

NEW FLASHBACK: Eleanor is forced to do an escape room with whatever company she's temping for. She sits in the corner and rolls her eyes. Her co-workers and smiling and laughing and scrambling to figure out what to do, which is so obvious to Eleanor it practically hurts. ""Hey dumbasses,"" she calls to them. Never looking up from her phone, she explains what to do. It's right. She goes on to lead them through most of the escape room. Maybe it's lame and stupid and she rolls her eyes a lot, but it's nice to feel needed. Though she never lets them acknowledge it after the fact, by the end she's smiling. She may even give someone a high five. In a moment of weakness.

We're back to the present. Michael continues talking:

""Your best moments on earth --the moments when who you are helped you through, when you felt liked and needed, when you reached your full potential-- were all in escape rooms. So we gave you an eternal escape room. Welcome to the Good Place, you've been here all along.""

He snaps his fingers and it flashes to white. Fade in to the opening shot the season one.

Eleanor smiles.

&amp;nbsp;

 1 This goes almost without saying: this is a GREAT SHOW.  

&amp;nbsp;

 2 I believe I read somewhere that there will indeed be another twist at the end of this season. Whether that means that there will be a twist every season remains to be seen but I do think there is merit in thinking about what the truth is (especially with the clues we've received so far)

&amp;nbsp;

 3 That being said, I think something is up with Janet. Im not just saying this bc shes my favorite character. I think it is very suspicious that Michael was able to get a Good Janet without much effort. I dont know what this implies but we just seemed to gloss over that point and I think there is something there. 

&amp;nbsp;

 4 Not to spoil much, but we know that the last episode of Season 2 is called 'Somewhere Else'. I read on here somewhere that Janet will most likely use her new powers to create this new place. They are after all running away from the bad place which no doubt is going to persue them. 

&amp;nbsp;

 5 Does anybody else think its weird that they are all trying to be ethical AFTER THEY ARE ALREADY DEAD? This was confusing for me when they were in the Bad Place HQ and when they were trying to get rid of Derek. They had to do it in ethical ways, which just makes things unnecessarily difficult. I understand that they need to show growth/development but its not as if someone is keeping score on their actions in the AFTERLIFE. That being said I think the scoring system introduced by Michael also has some things havent been revealed yet.   

&amp;nbsp;


 6 I think Jason gets a bad rap on here. There is something very valuable in being able to look at something from a different/critical angle or at the very least being able to see things when you are not so heavily invested. I think besides Eleanor he is for sure the smartest one (Michaels knowledge of Jasons passion for Blake Bortles was the starting point for the clues in the roast, Jason figured out they were in the bad place that one time, and he said they were on a prank show). 

&amp;nbsp;

 7 For that reason I think Chidi is probably the least intelligent. He may be EDUCATED but he can't seem to grasp differing/surprising ideas/actions even a little bit. (Try counting the number of times he says 'What??' in each episode). I think hes very judgemental. Tahani is...acceptable.  

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for a great sub. You guys are all awesome.

Think about it - his whole idea was that terrible people would become worse and worse and poison each other's existence. Instead they banded together, improved and literally redeemed a demon. 


This idea seems so ridiculous, that Shawn dismisses it outright and the Judge only gives the four a shot for entertainment. It seems safe to assume that The Good Place works the same way - good people get in *and never change*. 


But what if it's wrong? If the show's protagonists can improve in hell, why can't the high-scoring philanthropists get rotten *after* they got to the good place? No architect is present in the neighborhood to keep them in check and Janets won't rat anyone out.


This might seem like reaching, but I think there is a very good reason to think that it's true. Remember backstories Michael invented for all the demons, particularly fake Eleanor? They were supposed to be the people who willingly lost everything to help the less fortunate. Staying in paradise while the rest of humanity is literally being tortured is a direct antithesis to that. To a kind of selfless compassionate altruist that makes it to the good place, such existence would be absolute torture. Unless they change.",8,62,False,spoiler,,,,,

* Good Janet has now evolved enough to create a neighbourhood ~somewhere else~.

u/RandomePerson :

* My theory is that they do end up in the actual Good Place...and it sucks!

Everything is super boring, there is no pleasure anywhere. All things deemed pleasurable have been disallowed, so as not to taint anyone's ""purity"" with greed, envy, lust, or overindulgence. There's nothing to do or see; everything is just a bright, stark white. Life in the real Good Place is just sitting around and listening to some revered prophet talk about how awesome it is to be good. It's basically an eternal board meeting or church session.

The four of them realize that The good Place is so sanitized that it lacks any depth. So the next season will be spent with the four of them trying to break out of the actual Good Place.

Stalemate has been the whole theme of the show.

S1: 

Stalemate between Tahani and 'her' soulmate.

Stalemate between Eleanor and Chidi, between Eleanor being Good, and The Good Place holding together.

Then S2 happened:

Stalemate between Micheal and the humans working it out, between the demons wanting to play at all and Micheal keeping it going; and finally between Team Cockroach and Vicky.

At every episode, they throw the status quo away completely, but we always have a new stalemate. Two episodes ago, the stalemate was in three directions; between Shaun and Micheal and The Laws of the Afterlife. Because Shaun couldn't let word get out that humans had escaped, and Micheal couldn't let them get caught.

Now, after The Burrito, we have a whole new Stalemate. Eleanor doesn't belong in the bad Place anymore, but she won't go to The Good Place without the others. The fact that her selfishness extends to not letting the others find out that she can go 'up' by cutting the rest of them loose is proof positive.

But the thing is, we have a whole new stalemate now. Every time they've taken a step further up 'management'; the answer has always been the same: Nice to meet you, and you belong in the bad place, case dismissed.

The fact that this certainty requires absolutely no thought or consideration of any kind tells you just how tight the rules are on this case. So if a person who went to the Bad Place now belongs in The Good Place, what does that say about the whole system?

Behold the ultimate Stalemate. If Eleanor cuts the others loose and goes 'up', then she's being selfish, and that's the end of that. But if she doesn't change her mind, then it means a Good Person goes to the Bad Place when she doesn't deserve it.

Michael argues that the four of them didn't have proper representation. He will represent them in another trial which they will probably fail, but.. the judge will be touched seeing how far a demon has come because of these people. That in combination with the fact that they have all improved, will somehow show the judge that maybe the system is a bit off. 

Through this experience, the judge will decide that they all should go to an entirely new place which will be designed by Michael and created by Janet. 
They will then run this ""new"" place, where improvable people go to get better before entering the good place. They will have to successfully change some number of people ( or some particularly bad people? ) in order to get to the good place..

What kind of sociopath believes that theyre so much better than everyone else that they, and their tiny minority of friends, deserve eternal bliss while everyone else deserve to be tortured forever? Not people who deserve it - as Chidi and Tahani show.

Thereve been a couple of theories here that Team Cockroach will inspire the Judge or the system to reform and turn the Bad Place in to an opportunity to learn and earn their spot in the Good Place. I think thats where they already are; all the humans and demons are in a _Next_ Place learning to relate to others and themselves. Or Elenors the only real person and shes going through something everyone goes through after they die.

If Im right, then the arc of the show is about expanding circles of compassion. In the first season, Elenor learns to have compassion for herself and for others shes impacting. In the second, she and the team learn compassion for their friends. In the following seasons theyll learn compassion for people in a similar situation (other normal people being tortured in the Bad Place), and then outward. The series finale then will be the team, and everyone else besides, stepping in to the _Next Next_ Place. 

The next next place could be the actual Good Place and thatd be a lovely finale. But I think itd be more in keeping with the spirit of Season 1 and Tahanis journey - that acting good in search of a reward isnt actually good - if its not bliss but nothingness, nirvana.

So where? And how could it constitute a season twist that we won't have seen coming, yet a bunch of clues were there?

Let's see where they could possibly go:

1. The Medium Place with Mindy, or another Medium Place without Mindy, as long as all 4 are together

2. Janet's void - She is able to create an entire person in there, so an ""Other Place"" neighborhood isn't too far-fetched.

3. Some kind of entirely new Rehabilitation Place of which Gen puts Michael in charge, with Chidi giving ethics lessons to give otherwise Bad Place goers a chance to turn good.

Thing is though, I see those 3 things as kind of a series ender. The entire show has been about avoiding the real bad place, and if they do go to a relatively safe Somewhere Else next episode, that main plot is done, and the conflict is over. So where would Season 3 go from there?

This leads me to believe that this special Somewhere Else has to be temporary, maybe lasting up to 3 episodes out of Season 3, with the threat of ""oh shirt guys, if we fork this up we're all going to the bad place for real""

1. A kind of purgatory with extended tests? Like a do-over of Michael's initial Fake Good Place neighborhood, except this time there's more actual humans and no demons

2. A temporary second chance at life, to see what they end up doing different?

The thing I do wanna see is a reform of the Bad Place and point system, seeing how incredibly unfair and arbitrary they are. And more background on the whole mythology of the show.

But this ""Somewhere Else"" thing is really making me think they'll end up creating an entirely new place like they did with Mindy. Whatever it is, I'm sure the writers will surprise me.",6,26,False,spoiler,,,,,

Neither am I great at analyzing plot hints and predicting what's coming up next, nor commenting on the complex moral philosophy in the show. But I'm sure that most of us can agree on these fundamental facts, as ""truths"":

&amp;nbsp;

[A] Most plots shown on screen but away from the four humans are truths, if not, they are explained in the same episode.

In ""**Michael's Gambit**"":

* Eleanor, Chidi, Jason &amp; Tahani *ARE* the four humans tortured in Michael's plan.

&amp;nbsp;

[B] Mindy is not part of the plan, and all of the plots at Mindy's are *NOT* part of the plan.
In ""**Dance Dance Resolution**"":

* All of the previous plans set up at Mindy's failed, so they're all truths, stating that:
Michael is *NOT* in the Bad Place (although this one needs more proof)
Doug Forcett is somehow unreachable by the humans

&amp;nbsp;

[C] Mindy's middle place *IS* real, so does the orientation video in her episode.

* The raid in the BP episode supports this as a fact.

* But the orientation video in the MP did not mention the Judge. There's no new direct evidence to support that.

&amp;nbsp;

[D] Both the GP &amp; the BP are real. Supporting evidence are:

* GP: in episode ""**Jane And Michael**"", Val asked about the GP Janet: ""*Did you actually get into the Good Place somehow?*""

* BP: all the Michael flashbacks happened WITHOUT human attendance and hence, not as a narrative towards humans, but a fact.

&amp;nbsp;

[E] The fight between Shawn and Michael indicates that Michael has already been on the humans' side.

There's no way for Michael to act ""good"" behind the humans just to spite and misguide the audience, because he needs to put his own job/life on the risk to act against Shawn(and he almost did). So it's true that Michael thinks the GP4 really belongs to the Good Place, and he may act as the advocate for the 4 in the next episode(""Somewhere Else"").

&amp;nbsp;

[F] It's almost impossible for the judge in ""the Burrito"" is part of human torture, but in case that IS, it's NOT part of Michael's plan.

&amp;nbsp;

I mean, I get it if y'all think this way, but:

* There's no reason for Michael to throw himself in rebel against Shawn for this.

* He's kind of a fugitive in the BP now, bridges are already burnt down with him aiding the GP4.

&amp;nbsp;

For someone who might say ""these are all part of a dream/ruse"", I mean, we've all seen so many shows with this stereotype. I doubt this show would also. So far I still hold my bind belief for the show writers.

I've seen theories indicating that it's part of Michael's torture, I think it's plausible but far-fetched. This show had already thrown many comedy stereotypes behind, hence a s1-like twist will be a huge bummer for a spectacular season.

First she has to put in the effort to fight her selfishness and question her choices, and then she's able to question the situation itself. Here's where I saw that in the first season:

- Episode 1x01: Chidi suggests her mistaken identity might be a test of whether she'll confess. Eleanor spends zero seconds considering this. Her instincts say that self-preservation is always the answer. She can't even follow through on the self-preservation by avoiding alcohol.

- Episode 1x02: Chidi tells her that garbage cleanup is a test of her unselfishness, a way to prove that she's worthy of his help. Eleanor tries, for a while. Suddenly there's five minutes left! She knows that her selfishness sends the neighborhood off the rails, so she should know that she's going to get caught, but she goes flying anyway.

- Episode 1x11: Eleanor concludes that in order to be a good person, she needs to go to the bad place. Suddenly a magic train appears - the judge's train no less! - to transport her to a magic medium place that she's been asking for all along, that's conveniently populated by one whole person. It's very obviously too good to be true. Eleanor's like, ""Sweet, let's go.""

- Episode 1x13: Eleanor is at the pinnacle of her growth so far. I can do nothing and let Chidi and Tahani go to the bad place? No, this isn't right. Jason tries to blow up the train? No, this isn't right. Janet won't start the train? No, this isn't right. Everyone's volunteering, demanding even, to go to the bad place? No, this isn't right. If she'd given up and said ""Well, I tried, guess I'm staying"" at any of these points, she wouldn't have figured out that it was all a setup.

That's why I think her test was so perfect. She had to get through multiple rounds of rejecting the easy out, and really struggle with doing the right thing at each step. Individual pass/fail? No, this isn't right. We can go to the good place, but they can't? No, this isn't right. Judge says this isn't the test? (believable since if they were gonna test only two people on selfishness, Chidi wouldn't be one of them)
 No, this isn't right. We've gone over tons of ethical theories, and some of them say it's okay to go? No, this isn't right.  Chidi wants to forget about ethics? No, this isn't ... hold the fork on, this isn't Chidi. It's only when she's her best self that she's able to withstand that many layers of test and figure out what the real trick is.

Elanor often says that there should be a medium place for people like her - selfish, but not outright evil.

Micheal is trying to build a bad place where the torture is existential, not physical.

And here and there, people on these forums (myself included) have suggested that this is more like purgatory where people are cleansing themselves of their bad behavior and trying to become better people.

The proof that the afterlife (as presented in the show) is broken is that the characters actually consider that the burrito might be the judge. They are so turned around by the surreal nature of their environment that they now second guess everything around them.

When you think about it, there's a lot of psychological trauma involved in getting people to a point where they think that a burrito is in charge of the fate of their souls.

I think it's more likely the show swerves by giving her a ""Yeah, seems unfair, but my job's to interpret the rules, not make them"" sort of attitude.

What Michael *does* have in his pocket though is proof that The Bad Place has been breaking those rules left and right for who knows how long.  The most obvious was Shawn's raid on Mindy's house, but for most of the Season 2 the show has been dropping hints that the entire hierarchy of The Bad Place has been sneakily breaking the laws of the afterlife.  With Michael turned informant, I think the Judge starts taking a deep look into what's going on in The Bad Place and clears house.  

After she's done, the only demon left in a position of authority left will, ironically, be Michael, who Shawn gave a big promotion to in ""Leap to Faith"".

There has been a lot of talk about points and torture (ironic and horrible), and what constitutes bad behavior. Its mostly very cathartic, little things that irritate everyone are punishable by eternal torment, who wouldnt get a little spark of joy out of that? That said, its kind of absolutely internally inconsistent in a way that I think is absolutely intentional, and is probably building to a crescendo this week.

Consider these Points:

* Tahani is punished because her good deeds, however numerous, were undertaken for fundamentally selfish reasons. She goes to the bad place because, taken together, she spent her life being irritating, selfish, and conceited. The people in the real Good Place are there because they completed good deeds selflessly, out of pure kindness. They are supposed to be the best of the best. Now tell me how literally anyone that good would accept a system where they get to live it up eternally while others are being tortured for EXTREMELY minor crimes. They arent evil, just flawed. No one weve seen in the bad place has brought horrors unto the world, theyve just been a little douchey, selfish, impulsive, or irritating. What life-long human rights lawyer could know that, and then ever enjoy their place in the afterlife? Even with the little clip Janet can play of the Bad Place, they must know whats happening there.

* As described the points system still sends fundamentally good people to the Bad Place. People who net zero, or who end up in the hundreds or thousands dont reach the levels supposedly necessary to go to the Good Place. Thats a pretty fundamental flaw in the system.

* We never see anyone get tortured. The tortures described are horrendous, but there is no evidence in the show of any of that actually occurring.

* When The Judge tests Team Cockroach, she tests them on minor personality flaws. Are we meant to believe that Tahanis need for approval is a manifestation of her inherent evil? That Eleanor being selfish (which arguably isnt even her fault) means that she deserves the same level of punishment as murderers? That Chidis indecisiveness should be tantamount to genocide?

* Michael, a demon that exists only to torture, is capable of significant personal growth, eventually being able to sacrifice himself to his own eternal damnation for others.

* Why on earth would the Judge need them to have representation? How could that even work? What demon would come and argue for humans in the Bad Place? After all we know that folks from the Good Place can't go there.

So heres what I think: There is no Bad Place, at least not as weve been led to see it. Points are a lie to facilitate a narrative of punishment for the bad and reward for the good, but don't exist and aren't a basis for jack shirt. All of this so far has been a test, or a punishment, that is building up to a jump into a different sort of test. The point of the afterlife presented in the Good Place isnt punishment and reward, but personal growth. Morality isn't necessarily a component in the first place, a tool for pick apart flaws, maybe, but not the root cause of/solution to their suffering (well, maybe Chidi's, but he brought that on himself). Maybe Michael is in on it, maybe hes a fundamental, unwitting part of it, maybe hes being made to go through it all as well (a different sort of life form needing a different sort of scenario). In the end, everyone has improved, and as a result gets to move on to a different sort of test, and another opportunity to grow.",12,18,False,spoiler,,,,,
