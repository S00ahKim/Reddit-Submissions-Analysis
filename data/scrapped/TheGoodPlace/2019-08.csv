(Cont. below),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/cotl1f/theory_on_the_good_place_janet_and_her/,celestialrage44,1565505763,"Lets get the obvious things out of the way first. Janet is all knowing. As long as she is in the afterlife, she knows everything that happens on earth. Janet Can also create any object from simply nothing. She can bend matter to her will.

Not only this, but Janet is seemingly the only character in the show who is both all knowing and all powerful. Characters such as Shawn, Michael and the Judges are not only not all knowing, they cannot summon any object either. Every other afterlife character is seemingly uninterested in human affairs, in some cases, they are even disgusted with humans, they truly do not care. But not Janet.

From the very beginning, Janet was always there for the humans. She would be helpful, kind and courteous. Anything the humans needed, was provided for them. Any questions that they WP had were answered.

So lets assume we are working off the premise that good Janet is god. That would mean that neutral Janet and bad Janet are her counterparts. Bad Janet runs all human affairs in the bad place. Im assuming that if they need bees with teeth then bad Janet is the summoner. Neutral Janet is truly neutral. She handles all the human files, and gives them to the department to make a decision on the point total.


Not only this, but as far as we are aware there are only 3 places. The Good Place, The Bad Place and the Medium Place. 3 places. And how many Janets do we see? 3.

We have only ever seen 3 Janets and that is it. Weve seen void Janets but they were completely unaltered. For the sake of argument, lets just say that void Janet is a backup of every Janet. If Janet gets marbleised, the backup in the void is activated to whichever Janet is necessary. 

So lets rewind slightly, we have established that Janet is all knowing and all powerful. The thing is, Janet can create PEOPLE. Honest to goodness, real people with real souls. Janet has the ability to create a soul. I think this reason alone convinced me.

First feature is actually pointed out in season 3 - unforseen consequences, yada yada yada, I won't explain it, because it was already explained better than I ever could. I will just add, that this always seems to work in favour of the Bad Place. We haven't actually seen much examples, so it's admittedly a pretty weak point, but I feel like unforseen negative consequences are considered more deeply than positive ones, and I have at least kind of a reason to feel that way. Due to butterfly effect, most actions should have about the same amount of both, and certainly with many actions we should see positive and negative unforseen consequences zeroing out. This, however, is not the case, as we are explicitly told that unforseen consequences ruin the point totals of all people so much, that literally no one have gotten into the Good Place for over 500 years. And if negative unforseen consequences are considered more deeply than positive ones, this pretty obviously ticks the scales in favour of the Bad Place

Second feature is pretty obvious and I'm pretty sure it has been pointed out in many other rants and has been touched by Eleanor in the first season - Bad Place is basically considered the default. There is a ridiculously high point requirement for getting into the Good Place, yet there is no corresponding requirement when it comes to negative points and getting into the Bad Place. Every person, that fails to reach impossibly high standards of the Good Place, automatically gets thrown into the Bad Place, unless this person is literally one and the only case in all history of humankind that both sides couldn't agree on, and, importantly, even if this person has done more, or even far more good than bad. This is probably the most obvious thing working for the Bad Place

Finally, the third feature is that the Bad Place is considered the default not only when it comes to judging people based on their point totals, but also in the very proces of awarding points. Let me explain: every action can essentially be treated as a sum of three factors - intentions, consequences and the action itself. Which elements are judged? Well, we know that actions themselves are judged - we are told that in the very first episode, and this is repeated in the third season by the accountant - every action has a point value associated with it. But that's not all - we also know that consequences of the action are judged, we get a pretty obvious example of that in the Book of Doug and it is literally the point of season three finale. Lastly, we know, that intentions are judged - they are, supposedly, the reason why Tahani ended up in the Bad Place (though, as we learn in the third season, even with good intentions she'd probably end up there) and, in case this evidence is too flimsy, we also see at the end of the first season, that Eleanor's point counted doesn't award her positive points for good actions made with bad intentions - although it very much grents negative points for bad actions made with good intentions. We come to the conclusion, that only good actions, made with good intent that have good consequences (which I will from now on refer to as actions GGG, as I will be coding all actions with three letter combinations G for good and B for bad, in order Intent-Action-Consequences) grant positive points, whereas actions BGG grant no points, and all other combinations grant negative points. Granted, not all combinations are equally likely, I can imagine that actions GBG are pretty uncommon, but we may assume that GGG and BBB are equally common, and all other combinations have at least non-zero probability of occuring (with, as we learn in season three, actions GGG being exceptionally common), so we still have a system with many opportunities for getting negative points, and getting positive ones being very unlikely. This means, that most actions will lead to people getting negative points, which in turn riggs the system in favour of the Bad Place even more

I started watching this show because Game of Thrones was over and I wanted something lighter in the aftermath. Then I'm hit with all this moral philosophy! I looked into utilitarianism and particularism and mostly landed on the former. I found the academic Peter Singer who calls himself a Hedonist Utilitarian. While I'm not sure if that's an actual field or if he's making an offhand remark, it resonated. Do what is good for everyone, but do what makes you feel good. So yesterday I bought a bunch of vegan food to try and will be making my tiny bit of good for the world. Has anyone else had their sense of morality amplified since watching?

And when they got sent back to Earth, Michael/ the Judge had to reset the timeline, go back all that time to when the four humans died? Millions of people had to have died and been sent to the Good or Bad Place in those few hundred years during all the reboots, so what happened to them when the gang got another chance at life? 

For the people who were alive during the four humans' time on Earth, they could have just gotten their memories wiped and been sent back down as well. But what about people who were born after the four humans' deaths or the people that lived in the few hundred years time frame during all the reboots? Would they stay in the Good/Bad Place until they would be born on Earth or would their entire afterlife existence just be wiped out until they were born again? In case of the latter, when the humans are sent back to Earth, does that mean millions of people just vanish from the Good/Bad Place all at once? 

Also, what if the four humans dodging death affected someone else's deaths somewhere else (like the Butterfly Effect)? They would be sent to the Good/Bad Place for a second time (whether or not they died in different circumstances) so would whoever is in charge of everything remember them?

I was confused for a bit but then figured out it was about season 3 coming to Netflix U.S. 

I love this show and I think it's kind of ridiculous that you guys have to wait for so long (considering we get to view it as it comes out). I also noticed no one was talking about using a VPN to view the show (this may have changed since then). 

I just wanted to throw out there that it is most definitely possible to view The Good Place when it comes out. I personally use NordVPN (I am in no way affiliated with them but since it's the only VPN service I've used it's the only one I can vouch for). If you select a server in The Netherlands (where I am from) you can watch the episodes as they air.

Since her introduction in S2E11, we have never seen the judge, Gen, alone. We know that the producers are very meticulous about what scenes are in the show and the fact that she has never been shown alone in her thoughts might mean something. If I were to bet on it, I would say there is about a 75% chance that there is a narrative reason for this, namely that she has something in her thoughts that the producers have decided should not be known at this point. 

Here are my reasons. 

* We know that they have in the past specifically not shown a character alone, namely Michael in the first season. 

* We know that judge is smart enough and willing to deceive people to prove a point. This is shown in Eleanor's test  (S2E11) where she lies and says that she can go to the good place if she's willing to leave Tahani and Jason behind. This, of course, was a part of her test and she passed.

* On the fact that Eleanor passed her test, she knows that fact and has not revealed it to anyone even when it might have made sense. One particularly relevant instance is in S3E11 when she is hearing debate over Michael's complaint that the point system is flawed. Michael argues that since Eleanor and crew improved in the fake Good Place, it shows they shouldn't have been condemned. However, Shawn (/Sean/Shaun) counters that they don't know whether they actually improved. The judge is shown thinking on this, but rather than reveal that she actually does know that Eleanor improved, she just lets the conversation go on to creating the New Fake Good Place.

* This is the last season, and it might be a more satisfying ending to see the judge smart and meticulous with her ruling rather than forgetting about relevant details (Eleanor's test) and relying on an abnormal test to determine the fate of humanity

Notwithstanding, there are some counters to the idea that the judge is hiding something

* I can't think of an obvious scene where she should be shown alone. It very well might be quite uninteresting to see the judge alone. 

* Maybe the judge is less willing to do trickery when it comes a legitimate meeting with other immortals than she is with an afterlife test which practically requires trickery. 

* I don't know of an obvious thing she could be hiding. I definitely have doubts on the idea that she wants everyone in the Bad Place. More likely, I think, is the idea that she is also testing Eleanor and somehow in this experiment she will show legitimate altruism, like letting Chidi fall in love with Simone in order to keep the experiment intact.",3,9,False,self,,,,,

1) Chidi and Simone are back in mix, with no memory of what came before. They're a good pairing. But now Eleanor has to fight her selfish instinct. What's good for Chidi is bad for Eleanor. So suddenly the rest of Team Cockroach has a problem. They want to help their group more than hey want to help their new charges. I mean, if you were Tahani, who's soul would you care more for? Your friends, or your paparazzo?

2) Janet and Derek have created a world now. Let's not skip over that. There's a few hundred new people in the cosmos. This puts the weird square of Mindy/Derek/Janet/Jason into a new phase.

3) Micheal hasn't told Eleanor about Shaun's threat to have 'Micheal' roast the four humans forever, has he? I can see him keeping it a secret, since Shaun would just wipe their memory of any confession on his part, so why bother? Micheal has a history of keeping scary truth to himself.

4) The greater plot is whether or not humans are fundamentally good or bad. If they're good, then having them be away from Earth will prove it. If they're bad, no amount of effort will make them turn it around. That's what the whole S4 experiment is based on. So I could see a scenario where at least one or two of the new residents just won't learn.

5) Possible ending? Eleanor and Micheal are the core of this show. The battle of wills between the Demon Daddy and the Arizona Trashbag has gone from 'cat-and-mouse' to 'worthy-opponent' to 'we're-so-alike' to 'honorary family'. I could see the two of them rounding out the show's main plot. Not as an item, as a partnership. 

If the experiment only half works, then the judge has to respect that it's possible, if not certain. It would be in character for the show to make a major callback to S1, where Eleanor would tell anyone who listened that 'she deserved a medium place'. I could see the Judge ruling that the Afterlife should be able to decide, rather than leave it with the Accountants.

So I could see Eleanor and Micheal making a Medium Place, for new arrivals. Maybe a permanent one, maybe just to see what they're really made of, away from the Unintended Consequences.",3,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

1.	No one has gotten into the good place since 1497, including the isolated tribesmen from places like Sentinel Island or the Siberian tribesmen (who certainly wouldve have had limited contact with the Europeans or Chinese in 1500). Also, Doug Forcett having 500,000 points at 68 means that the points qualification for the Good Place is ridiculously high. This suggests that you cant simply not have any harmful impact on other people, but that you also must have a big positive impact on those around you and the rest of the world. If you were a medieval serf tied to your lords land for your entire life, and you lived out your average, exhausting existence, youd still go to the bad place, because you didnt do enough good for the world.
2.	Literally any consumption action a person undertakes in the modern world incurs negative points. But thats bullshirt, whether you live in the capitalist system of the West or an anarchist commune a la Catalonia or the totalitarian management style of the USSR. No matter what your political beliefs are, any economic system needs people to work in systems against their will so that your society can function. Whether thats being paid or working for devotion to your system/union or literal slavery is immaterial, but Im sure in all of these societies many people work in their companies or co-ops because of their social contract, not because they truly think spending a third of their day in a factory is their prime directive. So by buying a dress or bartering for it with tools in a commune youre still incurring negative points in this trade because of people having to engage in society, plus whatever negative environmental pollution was produced by making the dress. You lose points either way, even if youd admittedly lose less points if people were bribed or guilted into making that dress instead of being forced.
3.	The truth is, the world has improved so much since the world became interconnected. The decrease in child mortality, the death of smallpox, the increasing global prosperity, the increasing exchange of ideas, and the other nearly infinite multitude of aspects that the world has improved by are testament to this. Even though Jonas Salk gave away his polio vaccine rights to the public, he lived in a society where private property was ok and benefited from the philanthropy of rich people like the Mellon family, who gave Salk the grants he needed to continue his research on the polio vaccine. The excessive selfishness of our world is the cause of much pain and misery, but the moderate selfishness has been a big driver of human progress in our modern world. Solar panels would not be so ubiquitous if they werent so cheap to make and import from China.

I think the real point the show is trying to make is gauging the amount of selfishness that is ethical for us to live. If everyone was as selfless as Doug Forcett or that Good Place investigation team, the world would not progress because of how distant everyone would live, how inefficient everyone would work due to the lack of economies of scale (that would result in more hungry mouths due to less food produced), and how much evil would be abetted due to the unwillingness to do selfish things to get selfless achievements accomplished. 

I personally know people that went to trade school to learn how to operate an oil rig, not because they hated the environment but because it was the best option for them given their socioeconomic background and geographic location. Should they have stayed idle and unemployed and not helped out their families? 

Should the WW2 soldiers of the USSR not fought against literal genocidal invaders due to the fact that it wouldve extended the political will of another tyrant? Should the French Resistance not have destroyed key bridges, railways, telephone lines, and munition depots during Operation Overlord, as that wouldve counted as destruction of public property and indirectly lead to the deaths of more Wehrmacht soldiers?

The world is too complex to boil down to selfish = bad / selfless = good.",11,7,False,self,,,,,

She walks into his office and sits down in front of his desk. Still confused, she asks What is this place? 
Well, to put it straight, Eleanor, you died, the old man white haired man replies. 
How did I die? She asks. The last thing I remember I was at the grocery store. 
Well, be begins. You dropped a bottle of margarita mix and while your bent down to pick it up, you were hit by a line of grocery carts. 
Yeah, that totally sounds like a me way to die... 
Wait theres more. You were able to grab onto the side and pull yourself up, but you were dragged into the streets and were struck by a truck advertising a male genitalia erection pill called Engorgio.
Huh, thats how I died. Eleanor, while embarrassed, is not surprised. 
I just have a few more questions, she says. Who are you and.... where am I?
Oh, I totally forgot to introduce myself, how embarrassing, the man looked exhausted, as if he had been through this same procedure hundreds of times. My name is Michael, and Im the architect of the neighborhood you will be spending the rest of eternity in. 
So, am I.... up there? Or down.....there? 
Well, theres no heaven or hell like you were raised to believe, but in the afterlife, theres a good place, and a bad place. ...youre in the good place.
