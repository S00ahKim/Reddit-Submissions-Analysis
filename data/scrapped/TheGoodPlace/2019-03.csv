She has less of a need for the approval of others.  She name-drops less often, for example.  My question is this: is she also deriving more *happiness* from life (or experiences, or being, or whatever you want to call it)?  On earth, being close friends with all those celebrities didnt seem to bring her happiness. She was never satisfied or content.  Is she deriving more happiness and contentment from life now that shes improving?

Relatedly, Ill mention that the philosophy of the show seems very externally oriented.  Its all about the impact you have on others (e.g., points) and the influence others have on you (e.g., punishments). There doesnt seem to be much room for the idea of Victor Frankl: The one thing you cant take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of ones freedoms is to choose ones attitude in any given circumstance.   Honestly, in real life people seem to vary a lot on that dimension. Some people would probably be happy even in The Bad Place, and some people would probably be unhappy even in The Good Place!  So, Im wondering if Tahani is changing from the latter to the former.

When you're born, you're of no utility to anyone. You have a great many needs, and no qualms about making them known, loudly and indiscriminately, but nothing to contribute, yet. In fact, for the first decade and a half or so of your life (depending on circumstance), you take much more than you give. Of course, we humans understand this as taking the necessary time to grow and develop into better, hopefully more useful people later, but what does the afterlife see? A whole lot of negative actions, resulting in a huge negative total, which presumably you don't work off until well into adulthood in the best of circumstances.

If you die before this time, you're below the threshold, even if we assume it scales with age. Which means, every child, every infant who has ever died, is in the Bad Place. Think about that: you've just barely gotten started with your life, everyome talks about the big and weird and exciting things you'll experience in the future; then one day, something scary happens that you don't understand, and suddenly a lot of bad people are doing horrible things to you for some unintelligible reason. You wonder if it's your fault, if this is punishment for something you did, and maybe your parents will come out and explain exactly what; but slowly, it sinks in that they're not here, you'll never see them again, and happiness fades to a distant memory, if it stays at all, as you realise that this is the way things will be, forever. Or worse, you were only a few months, or a year or two old when you died, and you've never known happiness. You've never known compassion. You've never known any of the good things fundamental to human life, and you don't even have their memory to hold on to through the ceaseless pain and misery which is the only existence you've ever known.

I've tried every way I possibly could have to get out of this. Maybe the system has some shred of compassion? No -- it's not human, there are no humans behind it, and eternal torture is apparently perfectly just under any circumstances in this universe. Maybe the Good Place pushed hard to keep anyone under a certain age out of the Bad Place? No -- S03E10 shows they're A-OK with eternal torture as well, and obsessed with process above all else. They wouldn't do anything about this, and wouldn't be able to in any case. Maybe there's some preexisting provision anyway? No -- it's been established that all Places are either Good, Bad or Medium, that each Medium Place is single-occupancy (S02E12), and that no one goes to the Good Place anymore.

I can't get this out of my head. I may have genuinely ruined this show for myself.",4,7,False,spoiler,,,,,

In this article, Mike Schur says two very ironic things. 

1) He says the best comedies are low concept, not very intense plots

2) He says every comedy should have a real theme song, and that short tunes aren't effective. he says it would be a mistake to not be willing to carve out twenty seconds of air time for a theme song. 

Kind of ironic that he created essentially the most high concept comedy ever, and it doesn't have a theme song",4,32,False,self,,,,,

He can't argue that the subjects are somehow better than the average human and he can't argue the gang got lucky. Assuming the gang is remotely effective, Mike is going to have a very easy time of arguing his case, because he can argue that practically any other subject can be expected to do even better - and bear in mind here that the judge privately already knows Elinor would of made the cut, she just can't act on that officially, and she knows Shawn tried to sabotage the experiment.

Now maybe the 6 don't get into the good place because a bunch of greater good or good place being ducks reasons, but Shawn will be beaten at least as a personal threat. He's lost and he's going to start losing loads of bee nostrils, he just hasn't seen it coming yet.",1,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

But, the differences between that reality and our reality are so great that it is becoming a problem.

The Good Place is saying everyone goes to the bad place in that reality because of unintended consequences such as product sourcing for what they want buy. The Amish do not have that problem at all. They do not use electricity and they basically live in their own area and farm and grow and make their own stuff. Likewise, many communities of Catholic monks and nuns lived the same way during parts of the time period in question except for more prayer, donating more stuff, and having less diverse diets such as giving up meat 6 days a week. In the good place universe, it is pretty obvious given their score formula and no one getting enough points that many famous people in our reality do not exist in theirs. Many inventions should get massive points. The huge points for eliminating slavery or changing the socal consciousness of an nation make it hard to imagine how some people in our world history would not qualify. Medical procedures used to be extremely painful. Anesthesia, antibiotics, and similar had to be worthy huge amounts of points, especially given the the inventor of the first antibiotic around the time of ww2 opted not to patent it, giving up huge amounts of money so as to make it more available and accessible.

The thing is that so much of our way of life is reflected in the show as being the same, but none of the heroes and saints that made it so exist in the good place universe that it is distracting

I mean I can seem how Lincoln mightily have not made or because of war canceling out ending slavery. But people like Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa are universally seen as amazing heros by people across the world of every religion, race, and culture and their points would be extremely high. In polish workers movement that John Paul II basically created and animated ended up ending the USSR peacefully. Not to mention when the pope blessed AIDS sufferers. He wrote about aids and developed the official Catholic position that they be respected, loved, and given medical care and fought strongly to help them to the point where it was estimated that 27% of all medical care for aids victims was provided by the catholic church. I mean his impact on the lives of aids victims was huge and the amount of points using the good place point system would have been massive. There are hundreds of other people who have have shaped society and it is hard to imagine life being as similar in that reality but lacking any of the people who would have the points needed for the good place.

I have heard some people argue using their own views of right and wrong. That is not what I am talking about. I am not using my own scale orange views. I ask that people please don't use their personal values. I am talking only about those stated on the show or directly addressed by it.

The good place has never said points are won or lost by abortion or contraception, don't please don't reply like some have on past threads to mention these at all. The podcast and interviews make very good clear that going good due to seeking salvation still full counts as a points. Please understand that I am using the shows point system, so do not argue with saying that religious motivations negate the points. There show runner said that isn't true. I am well aware that in our universe and to me personally, by the way, I see doing good to help someone as having a different intention than doing good to try for a reward in the afterlife, but there show runner explicitly said it doesn't work that way in the good place.

I, personally, don't think our universe or salvation is in real life the same as the point system. I am not arguing for it. Please don't do that either. I am just saying that using the Good Place point system and adding up those points for many real life deadly people, results in them making it to the good place. We know that because of the points or has shown us for various things and how or has defined intentions.

Anyway, my main issue is with groups like the Amish. Prior to refrigeration and the 1900s transportation road system, we didn't have the type of interconnected lives that there good place is talking about. Most people outside of England didn't have the same type of reliance of outsourcing. Yes, in England they had oppressed much of the world and their lifestyle relied on And contributed to slavery, oppression, and lots of bad stuff. The same is true of Wallstreet and northern united states cities relying on us southern slavery. But, most of Southern states had relatively close votes on the issue of ending slavery every year or two. It isn't possible to know exactly how many people in those states opposed it, but when a state legislature has 45-55% votes on bills to end slavery, it is reasonable to guess that opposition to slavery is real. Many parts of the US were still rural small towns and banking was contraversial. Many people did not buy Northern or English textiles, did not buy slave picked cotton, didn't use Wall streets banks that were involved with southern cotton or northern textiles thar used southern cotton, and such. My point is that southerners who formed the underground rail road, who had nothing to do with slavery and related stuff, and who lead decent lives should have sufficient points easily. Slavery is lots of negative points. Helping to free slaves despite the serious risks involved significant costs of time and resources. Housing them, feeding them, hiding them, etc. Plus the costs and risks associated with getting the politicians elected that voted to end slavery.

The same is true for some small town Germans. Not just people liked Maximilian Kolbe who was put in a NAZI death camp for his continued speaking out against the holocaust and then when the NAZI guards decided to kill 10 prisoners in retaliation to opposition by other people, Kolbe volunteered to take the place of a man with kids because he had none. He gave his life for another person. Not only him, but many people saved lots of jews. Jewish authorities have the pipe of thats time an award after researchers found that the underground secret catholic effect to hide and protect jews saved about 1 jew from capture for every 5 the NAZIs were able to capture and kill. Hitler was sold upset at protestant and Catholic subversion to him killing the jews and disabled that he made it official policy to try to destroy both protestant and catholic churches. Small towns with local farms in rural areas were not given as much NAZI attention in many ways. In fact, a major German flaw was not having a serious farm policy and that greatly hurt their war and is a big part of why they lost against Russia and thus the war. Small town people could well have gotten lots of points for saving jews and not had any sourcing issues with nazi stuff. 

Anyway, my point is that the sourcing issue is not a global thing even now. Some groups are likely the Amish. Plus some people should have more than enough points to make up for for just about anything. Eleanor was listed as only about negative 4k points buying the flowers shows pretty few negative points compared to the high gains for stuff like ending slavery.

Ghandi and most others who ended colonial oppression, slavery, etc were nonviolent. Martin Luther King was inspired by Ghandi, Jesus, and others who were nonviolent. Lincoln might be explainable as not making it due to the carnage of war and how slavery ended here, and maybe even FDR who helped people with socal security and the new deal can be explained not to make other from political power, war, intentions and such, but there are so many many people who can't be explained away.

My point is that I think that the good place is wrong in saying that humans all have done more harm than good or have been about even. There are lots of people in recent history who have been really good point bosses and have done lots more good than bad. The good place universe might apply to the lives of big city rich people, but it does not match up with this universe. In our reality there are lots of people who did much, much more good than bad over the past few hundred years. ",8,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

1)in the first season we learn mindy is a medium place, and sure at that time it made sence. Now , however, when we know no one gets in the good place for 500 years, it does not make much sence for only her ,that led a very selfish life untill the point that she had her epiphany, to be the only human not to go to the bad place. The only reason i could come up with, would be that her ideia was so fantastically good that someone in the goodplace interviened with the point system.

&amp;#x200B;

2) The part that bothers me the most is how the show deals with the ""human suits"". I understand they want to use actors to play the immortal beings in the after life, however, they only explain why the demons use human form(good enough for me), they say it is because they want to know how to torture humans better. This explanation , even if not expressed by the show, could be extended for the good place guys in the opposite direction, they could want to know what makes humans happy or just to relate with them. The problem i have is why the accountants(that just use data objectively), that mailwoman, and mainly the judge who they especifically say never went to earth to remain impartial(if she is supposed to be impartial she cant be in their skin or watch human shows that will make them relatable, and i know it is a joke) are in human forms

&amp;#x200B;

3) the final thing that confuses me are the time lines, michael says that time in the after life does not pass as it does in earth, however when he visits accounting he asks what will happen with doug forcet, well if their times is not equivalent, why the guy only refers to that earth timeline that michael altered. The timeline thing i can give a pass because the show smartly refers to the jeremy beremy thing as way to say that humans are no supposed to comprehend how time works in the after life, so why could I?

&amp;#x200B;

if someone have more decisive answers to this questions i would aprecciate it, also sorry for the english mistakes, im not native. ",13,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

Chidi &amp; Simone fall in love, come to Eleanor and ask if there's any way they can officially get married in the Good Place. Eleanor, being the Architect is asked to be the one to officiate. This is extremely painful for Eleanor and she can hardly bear it. Eleanor rises to the occasion and officiates, performing the ceremony, she's torn because she sees how happy Chidi and Simone are, and she loves Chidi and loves seeing him happy. And Simone is actually sweet and she likes Simone, but she has to keep secret her love for Chidi -- which makes her question -- wait a minute? This is absolute Torture, I'm actually in the BAD PLACE again, this isn't a test, this is just another way to torture me.  
But she turns it on the bad place, because she is able to be at peace with it all and just let's it go. And that's not fun for the torturers. It infuriates them. She's risen above them by not allowing / feeling tortured by it all. She's OK. She's actually OK losing Chidi so long as he's happy.  
And it turns out that the judge's decision wasn't the judge's decision at all, the whole thing was staged by the Bad Place somehow, to setup this new, very clever torture scenario, which didn't work.  
And somehow -- Chidi isn't really Chidi. It's a fake Chidi. Chidi's memory isn't wiped. This is Eleanor's torture we're watching. Chidi has his own torture going on they've planned for him. What we're watching right now is Eleanor the Tahani's torture conjured up by the Bad Place and painted as if it's a test (but it's not, it's just the bad place).  
Michael has actually been kidnapped and the Michael that fell apart and forced Eleanor to step in as the Architect is actually Vicki in the Michael suit. Somehow the judge is also either kidnapped or severely distracted.

Eventually the judge and/or the real Michael breaks loose and comes in to break it all up.

Not sure how it would all fit together, but that's an idea.",16,157,False,spoiler,,,,,

*That* is predicated on the concept that the people have to improve- Soul Squad/Brainy Brunch/Team Cockroach had to improve because they were garbage people; a narcissitic giraffe, an Arizona trash bag, a human indecision, and literally the dumbest person we've ever met; but Simone isn't a 'bad person', she's just subject to the unintentional consequences of 'being a human' that make everyone go to the bad place immediately, do not pass go, do not collect $200.

We were never introduced to any evidence suggesting she's a bad person in really any way; or someone that needed 'fixing'. In reality, we're actually exposed to data suggesting she's a pretty seriously *great* person by every metric- she spends her time studying the human mind all toward medical advancement, goes out of her way to help her friends, and is a strong and pretty badass lady all told. We even see her during a time of personal strife when it would be easy for her to revert to being a hurtful/vengeful person (her breakup with Chidi) and she still is a stellar human being throughout it.

**Theory: Chidi doesn't have to be rebooted to keep him from ruining the experiment because he really wouldn't have to educate Simone on ethics and ethical living; she's already doing a pretty baller job of that on her own, and Chidi could avoid her for a year until the experiment wraps.** 

The gossip columnist (and theoretically the other 2 people brought to torture Eleanor and Jason) are probably going to require his help; but there's no reason to think Simone does. If she could be kept away from Chidi (as Michael notes is totally possible) for a year the study's integrity could be maintained and he could still educate the others on ethics to ensure they become better people in the afterlife.

I *will* admit part of this is because I ship Chidi &amp; Eleanor way too hard and to break them up after all this time trying to get them together makes me so sad it hurts. But I also think there's a continuity problem here that should be addressed; the bad place chose Simone because she'd torture Chidi, but neglected to note that she's a great person and doesn't need Chidi's mentoring.

His voice sounded very familiar so I immediately went to IMDB to confirm my suspicions only to find out that this character is uncredited. My big guess is that it's Jon Barinholtz, so I also checked his personal page and it shows no credits for The Good Place. If you don't know Jon, he is on the show Superstore and plays the character of Marcus (boob cheese anyone?) Everytime my girlfriend and I watch this episode now I tell her that it's absolutely Marcus even tho I have found no way of proving it. Does anyone have anymore information? Is it really Jon? Is it someone else? Hopefully someone knows or can at least do some better research than I can. Plan on crossposting to the Superstore sub and hopefully this can be resolved.

When the judge made arrangements to set up the latest neighborhood to test Michael's theory, she brought in Shaun from the bad place - but nobody from the good place. That's an obvious conflict of interest, considering Shaun is out to get them - so, at the very least, it would have made sense for the judge to have had someone from the good place pick half the people for the neighborhood. She's the judge for both worlds, so it's not like she couldn't have snapped her fingers and brought a representative from the good place like she did with Shaun. 

We've seen a supposedly sectioned-off part of the good place, which featured one person. Then, we also saw someone from the good place in Mindy's orientation video for the neutral zone. That's all. What's to say the two people we've seen from the supposed good place weren't actors? And then you wonder why Janets - which are supposed to be for the good place, aren't actually stored in the good place - and why they're so readily available for the bad place to take from. If there was an actual good place, the Janets would be stored there instead. That would only make sense. The writers obviously thought about all of these absurdities, which means there's something extra that hasn't been revealed. What I'm getting at is that some of it doesn't make sense for a reason: the good place does not actually exist.",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Then in S3, in the soulpet reboot, Chidi again picks a(n Arizona) trashbag over flying.

But why is no one talk about, that a demon is changing for good? 
A demon is a creation of pure evil, and so was Michael. 
But because of getting contact with humans and becoming they're friends, he put all of his energy to bring them into the good place. 

But no one is questioning the consequences of that in the series. It is only used as a thread. ( You know: Michael suit)

Much like TGP, it is an entertaining exploration of the realm of gods and devils.

The basic premise of the series is that there are various offices that oversee certain aspects of life: Death, Time, Fate, War, Nature, Evil, Good, and Entropy. For each of them, the office is held by humans selected to occupy them for a time.

Much of the series wrestles with the nature of Heaven and Hell, much like *The Good Place*. Because some of the ideas in that series intersect with what TGP is exploring, and because it gives away a bit part of the overarching plot of the series, I've spoilered the following:

&gt;!In the *Incarnations* series, Hell is broken. It was originally intended to rehabilitate evil souls and give them a path to Heaven. But, for some reason, it became a gratuitous, purposeless torture pit. The overarching plot of the series deals with what might have gone wrong both on the part of God AND Satan to allow that to come to pass.!&lt;

Give it a read! I've been inspired to re-read the series, because of the themes that *The Good Place* has reminded me of and given me a fresh perspective on.

Maybe this has been brought up already and truth be told I'm not going anywhere with this but it's something that's been on my mind for a while and I feel like this is the place to ponder out loud.

So, we're told that Michael devised a Good Place as a form of torture. In order to do so, he went to great lengths to ensure that the f(alse)Good Place was as close to the r(eal)Good Place as possible, even so far as stealing a Good Janet.

And my question here, to which I have no real answer, is... why? Humans have no idea what the (r)Good Place is like. Everyone else in the (f)Good Place is either a demon (who are in on the joke) or Janet. Now you could say that the (f)Good Place had to resemble the real one in order to fool Janet into cooperating, because otherwise you couldn't replicate ""good"" conditions (Neutral Janet doesn't care and Bad Janet would ruin everything). But all of that is happening because they wanted to replicate the (r)Good Place from the beginning, something that they did not have to do, because humans don't know what the Good Place is like!

Am I making sense here? It seems futile to replicate something when that has no bearing on how humans perceive it.

We also know that it didn't replicate the (r)Good Place. The little we know for sure about the (r)Good Place is that it smells like happiness and that it's run by Lawful Good bureaucrats who are slow, ineffective and gullible. And the (f)Good Place was often filled with signs that it wasn't the real one, I mean, frozen yoghurt? Clam chowder fountains? If human trashbag Eleanor can tell it wasn't the (r)Good Place, then Janet could have told much faster, and the plan would be ruined from the start.

Anyway, my question is: what gives? And I don't know the answer. Either this is a simple plot hole and I should suspend my disbelief (there's bound to be plot holes in a comedy show about the afterlife), or... what if this is actually significant? What if, and stay with me here, the idea of an imperfect heaven was the goal all along? I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but I wanted to share my... lengthy... thoughts.

TLDR: Michael didn't have to replicate the Good Place to torture the humans into believing they were in heaven, because humans don't know what heaven is like. He could have invented any ""heaven"" he pleased, but he tried to make his experiement as similar to the real Good Place as possible, and I wonder why.",5,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

So, I was re-watching some of our fav show after finishing my Kant reader and some associated texts when it struck me that Chidi seemed to be a bit of a, to but it mildly, lame Kantian (If he could be described as one at all). On the outside, the Categorical Imperative seems to be right up Chidi's alley. Universalizing a maxim seems to really speak to him due to his social anxiety and on the surface it seems to fit. But, things turn fishy when you take Kant farther. Kant famously Corresponds with a woman about the morality of lying to her boyfriend, ending with her (perhaps apocryphally) falling into a deep depression and sent to a asylum.

Kant's primary idea, The Categorical Imperative, the idea that to be moral all you needed to do is respect the autonomous rational minds of others, and not infringe on their autonomy or rationality. This leads to Kant's hard and fast rule about lying, and how its the number one Kantian no-no. The problem comes in in how Kant treated this woman (Maria von Herbert) after she was committed. He spread her letters around, turning her into an object lesson about what NOT to do. And when people called him out on this, his response was very logical and self consistant.

""Well, she lost her rationality after she went insane, so all moral responsibility is absolved.""

This is one of the more glaring issues with Kant, as his philosophy has scoping problems. Everyone who doesn't hit the litmus test of 1. Be rational, and 2. Be Autonomous, becomes a non-person and all moral responsibility is absolved. This includes namely children and the mentally handicapped. This seems to not be Chidi's thing, as his morality would no doubt scope much larger, and have problems exploiting those who can't thing for themselves. he seems to be a natural law theorist with a strange adherence to Kant's lying rules.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my favorite lines is in S2E8, from Tahani.  Looking at IMDB and the show's podcast, it's not entirely sure who was the primary writer of the episode.  But kudos to everyone that worked on it and contributed.

&amp;#x200B;

""No one can ever truly turn over a new leaf.  

Sure, Ben Affleck told me he matured as an artist after he directed Argo...but then, right on schedule, it was *\*'Guess what, Tahani, I'm gonna be Batman'\*""*

First was Simone in Chapter 30: ""Good Point, counterpoint these are delicious free cupcakes get over yourself and eat one.""

Then Eleanor as Janet to Chidi as Janet in Chapter 36: ""Counterpoint... that's the dumbest thing you've ever said, and you do not deserve a puppy!""

The prosecution rests.""

#Link Flairs

No more title requirements!

Just choose a link flair to indicate up to what season youve seen, or what the spoiler level should be for your thread.

Link flairs have several advantages over titles:

##**1. They can be changed** ***AFTER*** **the post goes up.**

Unlike titles which cant be edited, with link flairs your post wont be deleted if it fails the spoiler check.

Instead, youll receive a PM asking you to pick out a link flair, and if you reply with the name of the flair you want (or just click the **FLAIR** link on the thread) it will automatically be approved. (You have **five minutes** to pick out a link flair on your own before the bot sends you a PM and takes down your post until you reply.)

As a reader, if you come across a misflaired post, you can hit the **REPORT** link to send it to the Mod Queue for review.

* **Example:** Memes that are flaired as `No Spoilers`. All memes should be flaired as `Shirtpost` to warn users that these comment threads are **not monitored for spoilers.**

##**2. They can be filtered.**

Click shirtless Chidi in the sidebar (careful, hes ticklish!) to filter out all Shirtposts in one step.

If youre not up to date with the series, click the season youre up to and everything past that will be hidden so youre not tempted to spoil yourself. :)

##**3. They support CSS.**

Apparently no one in 500 years has been good enough to get into the good place because living in todays world has so many negative consequences.  Buying a tomato is the example we were given.  Mindy wouldn't be any different.  The 'she died so her good points went up and she didn't keep accumulating bad points' is bullshirt and you know it.  She's at least in her 30s.  You're telling me no one in the last 500 years did anything equality good in their teens?  No one set up a good charity or invented a good tech that saved lives in their teens then died?  Nah.

So it's either a timeline thing where the main characters end up succeeding in their goal and Mindy is a beneficiary and they get to interact with her because the timeline loops and moves backwards and whatnot, or it's a plot hole.

Ive decided to put this behind a season 3 spoiler wall in order to preserve the glorious twist that is The Good Place. My meta theory is part philosophy, part meme, and also regarding the show. However, I hope the Good Janets of this community (the mods) will tell me if this is the wrong subreddit (hopefully it isnt). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fascinated by philosophy in general, and after reading on this very subreddit, thinking about the simulation hypothesis and remembering some key facts, I came to a kind of funny conclusion. 

&amp;#x200B;

We know that people in the Good place is tortured all eternity. That means that there will be demons torturing each person forever. To put this in perspective, this means that each person tormented will be subjected to each conceivable and inconceivable way. That there is a novel and new way of torturing someone for each grain of sand on earth, nay each particle in our galaxy, nay each atom times googleplex of the unobservable universe and more. At the end of it (imagen a supertask) you will be tortured in every, single way thats possible, most probably with parts of hope and joy and love to (because it will hurt more when it's taken away). We also know that they can create simulations, make fake realities and now (thanks Michael...) take away our memories. We also know that each and single one of us is going to the bad place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's leave that for a moment and go back to the simulation hypothesis that I mentioned. In the simulation hypothesis poses that one of the reasons we might be in a simulation is that we are far more likely to be in a simulation, just based on math. Feel free to Wikipedia the whole thing. Ill clumsily sum it up. Excuse my paraphrasing but: If there are one million simulations that simulate reality in a wayindistinguishablefrom reality, there is one chance in a million and one that we live in the real world, and about 99.99999% certainty that we are in a simulation. Of course, we cannot know for sure, all we can do is hypothesize. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now to the reason why I made this post at all, I will (again, clumsily)make some similar argument to the simulation hypothesis. Since one is tortured for all eternity... the chance of us actually being alive (and not already dead) is infinitely small. Just think about how shirt this place is sometimes, it got me thinking... 

&amp;#x200B;

Either the bad place isn't real. 

The soul squad succeeded in saving the universe. 

Or... holy motherforking shirtballs 

THIS IS THE BAD PLACE

Apologies if bad format, writing on mobile.


Something I picked up on: Eleanor has never said the words I love you or even felt real love until she met Chidi. More often than not they always fell in love during their time at the fake good place, but it always had to come to an end. Even in their second chance at life they fell in love but that unfortunately had to come to an end too with erasing just Chidi's memory. 


It absolutely broke my heart for Eleanor because she's been through it so many times and (one of) the main focuses of the series seems to be their romantic relationship... I just find it odd that it always has to come to an end and Eleanor has to go through the heartache again. It's torture and the worst kind of it, over and over.


Maybe it's my distrust due to so many resets it's hard to tell what's real but in the back of my mind I can't help but think all the other humans (Chidi, Jason and Tahani) are fake and this is just all about Eleanor and her ability to love.


Her relationship with her parents was shirt (Michael is now a paternal figure so she learns to love and be loved)


Her friends didn't even care about her almost dying (Tahani's character shows her what real friendship can be, platonic love)


Jason is a straight up hottie so love for the hotties (sorry I've not come up with an evaluation for Jason yet)


And Chidi is not like any other guy she's dated before so pretty self explanatory.



I don't know, maybe it all sounds like a bunch of bullshirt but I particularly find the pattern of her relationship with Chidi ...interesting.",8,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

From it I think we can make out a few basic details about the first episode. Potential spoilers for season 4 below. 

&gt;!* The [title of the episode](https://i.imgur.com/D8jI2xF.png) is faintly visible through the paper. It looks like it reads ""The [?] Truth Ceremony."" I can't figure out what the second word is, but maybe someone here has some ideas? 
* The [writer of the episode](https://i.imgur.com/fGYd4oE.png) has a name that starts with Ai and is moderate length. Based on the [previous writers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm), this means the first episode is probably written by [Aisha Muharrar](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3429611/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr14). 
* The [directing credit](https://i.imgur.com/XNodoYM.png) is a bit harder to decipher. We can tell that their first name has a letter with a sarif in the upper left and we can see parts of a few letters through the censorship. It appears as though there may be a k inside the first name. We can also get an idea of the length of the name, not too long. If I had to guess among the previous directors I would say [Tucker Gates](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003163/?ref_=ttfc_fc_dr10) but he has only directed one episode so far and it was in season 1. !&lt;
