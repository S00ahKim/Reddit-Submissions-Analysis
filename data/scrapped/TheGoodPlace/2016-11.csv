There have been many different theories I have seen for the entirety of the show, but after the most recent episode, there is so much opportunity.

However the thing I noticed that seemed to be the most off was...

 * Real Eleanor and Fake Eleanor both died at the near exact same moment, while in the same place, with identical names.

 * It was stated that they have no way to view people's appearances.

 * Jianyu and Jason Mendoza were not at all remotely similar, and it's highly unlikely that even if their deaths intertwined. Even if they did, their names don't share similarities.

 * Originally, I thought it was going to be forgotten about, it's not as important as Eleanor's plot line, but it seems that this IS the most important part.

 * We left on a closing scene where Tahani is waiting for Jason to return to his mancave, her posture is rigid and she has that look [from the Skai Jackson meme.](https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gotdressed2.png)

My Hypothesis

 * A. Jason Mendoza's real name is Jianyu Li, and he simply went by the name Jason

 *  B. He was, although a rambunctious person and slightly odd person, he may have also legitimately been a good person.

 * C. There is more to it than we know!

The first two are not much more probable, but my last point has me convinced well.

 * Eleanor will be likely sent to the bad place, but then they will find out about Jason and more investigating will be done until they can find out the REAL problem. There is also the possibility that they will intervene at the right time and Eleanor will never be sent to the bad place, but that kind of defeats the purpose of suspense.

Conclusion: No matter how we put it, Jason Mendoza will play a significant role in the later part of the film, but there is too little info to make a sound assumption.

Comment any ideas as to what could come next!
