I don't think that ""The Good Place"" exists. I think that it was just made up by the ""Bad Place"" in order to torture the people who end up there. They wanted to taunt everyone being tortured with the idea that if they had been just a little bit better, they could've ended up in paradise. And I know, you're probably skeptical, I was too at first, but lets consider some stuff together.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the first things we learn in the show is that the bar for getting into the ""Good Place"" is unbelievably high. Only the absolute best of the best of the best can get in. In fact, the standard is so high that we do not even know of a single person who has made it into the ""Good Place"". At various times in the show Michael states great people who ended up in the Bad Place for comedic effect, but never once do we ever learn of a person who went to the Good Place. However, we do know that there are many great people throughout history who have ended up in the Bad Place.

&amp;#x200B;

Second is the fact that there's no known way to travel to the Good Place. Supposedly the Judge has a way, but I'll address that later. We know that there are many ways to travel to the Bad Place from outside of it. You can take a train, or just teleport in as some people have. But when trying to travel to the Good Place, Janet, an all-knowing being FROM THE GOOD PLACE, has no idea how. We also know that Mindy St. Claire's house is halfway between the Good and Bad places. You can easily travel there by train from the Bad Place, but it is seemingly impossible to get to the Good Place from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Janet, let's talk about her (It?) for a second. At first, I thought that her existence as a Good Place Janet also subsequently proves the existence of the Good Place. But in rewatching the Season 2 episode ""Michael and Janet"", I realized something, Janets don't actually come from the Good Place. When Shawn asks Michael how he got her, he stated that the Good Places houses them in a warehouse out of the Good Place. Why is that? Bad Janets are housed in the Bad Place, why don't good Janets come from the Bad Place? Again we have an example of when the writers specifically and purposefully avoid confirming that there is an actual Good Place. It's small, but purposeful.

&amp;#x200B;

As I stated earlier I think the idea of the Good Place was made up by the Bad Place to further torture the humans who end up there. If this is true, that would explain why Shawn is so angry about the humans trying to earn their way into the Good Place while being resurrected on Earth. Sure, it makes sense that he wants to catch them because they deserve to be in the Bad Place, but what if there's another level there also? What if he's terrified of his entire system, the big lie about the Good Place, getting found out? It would explain his overly sporadic and almost scared behavior in the Season 3 premier. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I picture this twist being revealed. At the end of either Season 3 or 4, our heroes have finally earned their way into the real Good Place. Everyone is happy and celebrating as they step into the portal in the Judge's office. They step out of the portal, and there's nothing. Just blank space, every way you look. No people, no buildings, just emptiness. And then they realize, there's nothing here. Even Michael didn't realize the Bad Place's greatest trick of all; the Good Place isn't real. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still have mixed feelings about this theory. For one, it just makes sense. Rewatching the series this far while thinking about this theory feels a lot like rewatching Season 1 after knowing the twist at the end. You see that the writers put in a lot of small bit and details to make it all fit, right under your nose. It also feels like the kind of big long-form twist that this show would do. On the other hand, the idea that every person goes to be eternally tortured after they die would be kind of a dark twist, especially for a show as traditionally lighthearted as this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really curious to see what everyone else thinks about this too. I think you'll find that the more you think about it, the more it just seems to make sense.

It got me thinking about the discussion that popped up throughout S1-S2 about how the system was unfair, weird, etc., and how points stop accumulating after death, which is why the humans get returned to earth.

But it makes me wonder, maybe the endgame here is that the proof of the four humans to be able to evolve and grow creates a purgatory-type place, where your soul effectively gets more time to right the wrongs of your life...this is something the Bad Place would hate because they'd lose a ton of souls. And Michael would be perfect as the being to run such a place, since he embodies that sort of change over time.

It would explain why the Bad Place is SO concerned about the outcome of this experiment. It's not just that they hate missing out on humans to torture, it's that they might shift in the hierarchy of the afterlife if the experiment works. ",3,1,False,self,,,,,

The Season 3 premiere shows us Michael doing the Same. Exact. Thing. We see him repeatedly returning to Earth to make minor adjustments and at one point, we see his Earth Visit Paperwork covered in ""accepted"" stamps, while he hides his misadventures from Judge Gen. What's even more noteworthy is that these two parallels happen at the exact same time as their counterpart (Each a two-part season premiere). I am curious to see just how many parallels there are over the course of the season. Is this strictly thematic, or is there more foreshadowing going on than we thought? Could this just all be an elaborate ""Bad Place"" for Michael himself? Regardless, I'm really excited to see where this season goes.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

So over the course of the show we've seen people improve slowly. And of course as they improve the trajectory of the series seems to be about getting the gang to the Good Place (the 4 humans). 

However those are just the souls, but what about Michael? He isn't a human being but he's been learning to be human and learning to be ethical and has been doing everything he can to help the gang. While the story seems centered on the idea of ""can anyone change for the better?"" It feels like the story extends itself to Michael who was literally made to not be good. So with this growth it feels inevitable that even he will be risking everything to reach the good place with his friends.

My theory is that even if the gang ends up in the good place they might need to postpone it to help Michael join them. With the final moment of the series being Eleanor sitting across from Michael at the big deal welcoming him into the Good Place.

I agree that something isn't quite right with Simone, but it seems more likely that she's a human somehow being manipulated by Gen, maybe because she's dead herself, and if she succeeds at her mission, then she'll be redeemed.

Michael has always said that the key for bringing the team is Eleanor meeting Chidithat always worked in the reboots. But, he forgot one thing: in those reboots, Michael was also torturing them by trying to get them to torture each other, and as Eleanor said in the season 1 finale, all he succeeded was to bring them all together.

But now, Michael's doing the opposite: he's trying to bring the team together. Michael and Janet are now on Earth, so they'll definitely try anything to keep the four humans together. But what if it backlashed?

One story I can think of: Michael will eventually have to reveal to the four humans who he really is, but the team won't buy it. He'll explain everything, from they were actually dead and were in the fake bad place, to the fact that they've been given a second chance. However, without any power to bring back their memories, he just can't make them to trust him. Now since each of them has seen Michael previously in different occasions, they'll think that he's some kind of a scammer/con artist who brings them together to Australia to engage in some kind of a cult or whatever, which will make them go back to their homes and old selves.

Knowing how surprising and unpredictable the plot of this show could be, I might be wrong. But if I'm right, I can see it as the plot of the mid-season finale, with a huge cliffhanger of courseor maybe, even more surprisingly, this could be the plot for next week's entire episode.",6,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

As of now, Janet and Micheal can't go home. We've got two new mortals walking around. Trevor got tossed into the void, and Mikey took the Frog Key, which makes it almost certain that nobody else can come through.

This is good for Janet. Janet won't have her powers, but maybe she can do human stuff like find Jason and break out those diagrams they worked on so earnestly in S1. But she'll never find out if that guy finished his sandwich. She'll feel as dumb as we do, so Jason might actually have a shot to teach her some things.

Also good for Janet, I think that Tahani/Jason ship sank when Jason admitted he had a lot of fun *and* slept in a dumpster. Tahani will never look at him twice, but there's no 'regretful drunken night' behind them.

But this is terrible for Micheal. Earth is a fun place to visit, but now he needs a job, and a place to live, and figure out taxes. Earth is a nice place to visit, but we all hate to live there.

If Mike has a Really Bad Day, then he'll wind up in the Bad Place himself. Remember, what's Heaven for Humans is Hell for Demons, and Vice Versus.

With Trevor gone, Team Cockroach has three months to get their unofficial leader on-side. But if Mike can't keep his eyes off them, then sooner or later they're going to notice him; and I have no idea what happens then.",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Essentially, Doug Forcett wasn't 92% correct, instead he was 100% correct it wasn't what the angels and demons wanted to hear so they couldn't understand it or outright rejected it. Doug may or may not be an ultimate being who was just hanging out and happened to get high, or if he wanted to set things in motion. (We don't know if there's a big boss man or Architect like in the matrix who came up with the good place / bad place idea or if they just came up with it on their based on their nature, being good or being evil is fun, or if there's some greater purpose.

Ultimately, the 6 together as a unit are each others soul mates or it may be even include Trevor or a few others going forward. Michael unwittingly comes up with a great idea to torture humans and comes up with the design and criteria for the neighborhoods populace.

Michael can design, but he can't seem to create, he needs Janet to actually produce his vision and run it since he just seems to be the idea man, and as they work together they start creating a natural bond with each other, Michael from learning what it's like to be human, Janet through her long series of reboots and reincarnations.

In turn Michael brings in the 4 humans, each who died based on their major flaw, the deaths can be assumed to be due the fact that their counterparts / soul mates haven't been with them in life:

* Eleanor died because she didn't have a moral compass, which she desperately needs to guide her as she knows deep down she wants to do the right thing and be a good person. Chidi fulfills that balance.
* Chidi dies because he understands ethics and philosophy so much that his compass is too strong and dies from indecision. Chidi gets better when Eleanor can take in and translate his knowledge to make right decisions.
* Tahani dies from her vanity and jealousy, which is the opposite of Jason, who while an idiot; deep down is still humble and kind and ultimately just doesn't understand right from wrong. Jason and Tahani balance each other out, which explains the hookups in the season.
* Jason dies because of his lack of right and wrong, or basic understanding of simple things (snorkel in a safe), he loves the underdog (Bortles Rules!), and he's simplistic or ""Ya Basic!""

This is the original mix, all being soul mates in their own way and when they interact with each other they only get better, no matter what the condition is since they are always the same mix. Michael already sees this in season 3 commenting that Eleanor and Chidi always find a way to work together and solve problems. He's not understanding the interaction that he's been having with the group has also profoundly changed him and Janet and will continue to do so.

I could see season 3 they come to see this understanding more and maybe in season 4 they go to the good place or maybe the group starts getting some of Janet's powers and start running the place where the Demons and Angels seem to interact with each other.

Think about it. Michael is permanently trapped on Earth as a human now. He can't ever return to the afterlife because the Judge will just send him to the bad place. 

But as we saw in the conversation between Michael and Janet, when they're in human form, they're actually fully 100% human. Their bodies and minds follows all the rules that human bodies and minds do. They feel human emotions, human physical aches and pains, they obey human limits (Janet loses all her powers), etc. So if Michael and Janet are humans now and have to *stay* as humans because they'll be sentenced to eternal punishment if they ever return to their old positions in the afterlife...what happens when they die? Wouldn't they be judged upon death like other humans? 


This is important, because since coming to Earth, literally all Michael has tried to do is help people. If the point system judges every human according to their conduct on Earth (and explicitly doesn't factor in anything they may do in the afterlife, hence why Eleanor and co could receive no credit from the Judge for all the progress they made in the bad place), and Michael is a human now whose conduct since the day he set foot on earth has actually been purely and entirely good, then if he dies, wouldn't the system find him deserving of the good place? 


If that happens, wouldn't that kinda cause a crisis for the entire afterlife, if a demon earned entry into the good place? it could prove that everyone, even a pure evil being like a demon, is capable of change if given the right sort of moral guidance.


I think whats going to happen this season is that Michael is eventually going to sacrifice his life in some way to save the others, and that noble action combined with his exemplary moral conduct ever since he appeared on earth, will be enough to qualify him for the good place....and that is gonna trigger some sort of massive existential crisis for the entire afterlife system.

(Note: normally, awareness of the afterlife invalidates good actions because they're made selfishly to get into the good place. But I don't think that would apply to Michael, because he fully believes that he's going to end up being tortured eternally, and he's still do everything he can to help others. In other words, Michael is aware that there's a good place, but his actions aren't motivated out of a desire to get himself into it, but rather to help his friends).


What if the big twist this season was that it was never really about whether bad people could become good people, but whether a demon could be truly redeemed?",41,1,False,self,,,,,

So here's what I think. (and it's probably waaaaayyy of base) Maya (In forever) realizes they can do whatever they want, there are no real limitations except for the ones they put on themselves. So one of two things happens:

 1) Maya [In forever] was in the good place (Ocean Side) and when they leave at the end of the last episode they end up meeting some of the original architects of the entire universe. Upon meeting them and befriending them they give Maya the position of The Judge [In the good place] since she has in a sense broken free of both the good place and the bad place after realizing the nothing is really holding them there except for their choice to stay.  

2) Fred and Maya (In forever) realized the power they posses, and decided to create an entire new universe. Becuase it's like the one they are used to they make things similar, but the earth, good place, and bad place the characters (In the good place) are in is the creation of Fred And Maya (form the forever). Fred will come into the picture this season or next, and Maya made herself the judge of the after life.

Essentially forever is the precursor to the good place. Why do I think this? Well 1 Maya is in both, and two Alan Yang worked on both parks and rec and the good place with Micheal Schur. Matt Hubbard also worked on parks and rec. These three must be in cohoots. 

Id' love to hear other thoughts or connections. I think i'm going to rewatch both for other possible hidden connections. ",0,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It was said that this would create a new timeline, but how this affected the afterlife?

In last episode Gen said that Michael actions changed many things. So what this means for afterlife?

We would either have two timelines now:
1. Original timeline at about 2800 year.
2. New timeline at 2015.

or

Old timeline was deleted and every soul that died since 2015 erased from afterlife.

First option will lead to many duplicated souls, at least for people who were alive in 2015. Population born after will be increasingly different from original timeline due to butterfly effect.
Anyway we will definitively have souls that ended up in a Good Place in first timeline and in Bad Place after new Timeline. Our four humans are a prime example if they end in a Good Place in the end.
But... think about morality of Michael actions and those people who would end up in a GP but became bad after all the changes in events. It's a trolley problem once again.

Second option will result in erasing all the dead people from afterlife, which could be even worse. In first option we would have duplicated souls, but in second one we could end up in erasing a GP souls and replacing it only by a BP ones.

There's also a third option. That even though many changes in the world occur, everyone will end in the same score in the end. Leading to a point where, free will is an illusion and everyone has it's own destiny.

No matter what will happen, there's no good choice or a good ending. Every possible outcome is morally questionable.

The only logical explanation is that our humans, Janet and Michael never really left the Bad Place and this is all a torture for them.

Also keep in mind, that on Earth Michael and every other superior being  are just regular humans. So possibility to turn regular human souls into angels or demons is more plausible than ever.

Anyway, there's a lot of questions to be asked about events in third season. At the end of second season I though that this ""sent to Earth"" will be boring, but there's so many possibilities now.",30,1,False,self,,,,,

Not to mention how arbitrary the grading system is (dont even get me started on original sin). 

Its all being brought up in me again when thinking about the fact that the four main characters are each only about 30yo, making conscious adult decisions for just over a decade. With the exception of Jason throwing homemade bombs and selling drugs, they didnt even do anything to harm other people directly or physically. They werent actively good, sure, but they definitely do not deserve an eternity of torture. Especially since we get to see that with different conditions (and possibly with increased maturity), they can actually become better people.

So my idea for the show is that this is not some failed experiment for a new kind of bad place, but rather an actual purgatory where you get to earn a second chance (without knowing that you can earn a second chance). After that, I sincerely hope that theres some system like the one described in Dantes inferno. And Cincinnati for the truly medium people.

My guest is that Michael and Janet escaping to the human world Wil result in a cataclysm event that will involve both the good and bad place, and we'll never see it coming until it's too late.

I agree with these theories, and I offer some more evidence which I havent seen mentioned before, though forgive me if it has and I missed it.

In the orientation video from Episode 1, Michael says that every action you take is assigned a positive or negative value, based on how much good or bad that action put into the universe.

Later, Tahani finds out that she didnt make the Good Place because her motivation was corrupted, and this is also what helps Eleanor decide she has to sacrifice herself for the others.

However, these two pieces of information are contradictory - if points are awarded based on how much good or bad was put into the universe, why does motivation play a role? Whether or not Tahani truly cared about the people she helped, she still helped them. Does this not count as putting good into the universe?

The logical explanation here is that Michael simply lied in the orientation video, but Im not convinced of that. He had no reason to lie about how points were awarded.

But what do you guys think? Is this a continuity error? Is this another flaw in the afterlife waiting to be fixed? Is there a simple explanation Ive completely missed? Leave your thoughts below!",7,1,False,self,,,,,

2. Are we putting morals and philosophy into question? 
3. Are our characters being true to themselves but also evolving?

While struggling with a particularly sleepless night, I got on kind of a jag thinking about various details of the show made sense, especially now that we know demons can travel to earth.  Specifically: what actually makes demons and other immortal beings different from humans?  


The best clues we've been given seem to be contained in what we're told about ""retirement.""  It was apparently an important enough concept that they decided to make an entire [cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP1DqABvvN8) about it, and I don't think it's coincidence that it keeps being brought up.  We don't know if it's *quite* as bad as ""the eternal shriek"" (which they may have made up to mess with the humans), but its existence has been confirmed multiple times in conversations strictly between immortals.  Even if parts were exaggerated, I don't see why they would lie about the details concerning demon anatomy: that they're divided into an immortal soul (that remains aware and even able to process pain even when broken down its smallest ""molecules""), something called ""essence,"" and an immortal body.  


Another fact that gives us some insight into the nature of the immortal beings in the show is that they can consume antimatter.  Since all matter is instantly annihilated when it comes into contact with antimatter, this confirms that all of the creatures outside the world of earth must be made of pure energy.  This is also hinted at by the origin story of the Judge, or ""Gen,"" when she tells us that hydrogen was the only form of matter in existence when she came into being.  


Sidenote: I'm sure some of you are thinking (as I did) ""but wait, since antimatter can be contained in a cup from earth when it goes through the doorway, maybe antimatter doesn't work the same way in the immortal realm?""  This is definitely possible, but I believe the most likely explanation is that passing through the doorway actually converts energy into matter (and vice versa when exiting it from earth).  I feel as though that best explains how it allows demons to seamlessly blend in and interact with our world, but also strips them of any powers.


So, what does all this mean for how immortal beings and demons come into existence?  It seems to me that they must arise from some basic energetic molecule of consciousness, formed by the same stochastic (random) processes that caused our entire universe to form from a random instability in a single point of energy (ie, ""The Big Bang"").  Beings like Gen spontaneously emerged from energies released by the birth of the universe, and could rapidly grow in complexity at a rate that's impossible for something made of matter. 


It also seems as though the immortals who have been around longer develop a more powerful ""essence,"" and I would suggest this is what gives them their powers. Additionally, since it seems as though humans have immortal souls similar to demons but are powerless against them and cannot alter reality after they die, I would also suggest that ""essence"" is what separates humans from immortals. It makes sense as a differentiating factor which allows immortals to alter reality around themselves, create constructs, and project their will onto humans with a snap of their fingers. It's why a being as evolved as Gen can whisk away a powerful demon like Trevor with a wave of her hand, and why Sean can create a cocoon that's impenetrable to other demons at will.  


Based on those facts, here's how I would breakdown the 4 types of beings in ""The Good Place"":


Immortals, who have an immortal soul, immortal essence, and an immortal body/shell made out of energy.

Janets, who are beings of pure essence without a soul.  

Humans, who have an immortal energy-based soul contained in a mortal body made of matter. 

Animals, who have bodies made of matter but don't seem to have a soul which carries them over to the immortal realm.  (Note that the only time we really see one on the show, when Michael kicks the puppy into the sun, he remarks ""don't worry, it's only a construct"")  


When you think of the show's universe this way, the evolution of the afterlife and ""points system"" flows kind of naturally.  For most of the history of the universe, conscious beings formed only sporadically and randomly by chance energetic reactions.  However, at some point, souls started being ""born"" on earth at a massive rate.  Perhaps our brains evolve to the point where their electrical activity assembles something akin to the conscious and immortal energies contained in demons, and maybe it's even selected for by evolution (because, eg, having a soul confers a superior ability to survive and reproduce).  


Whatever the case, entities created by biological processes on earth are suddenly showing up all over the immortal realm, and probably fascinating and/or bothering the beings who reside there.  However, unlike those beings, they lack any powers and can't summon constructs or affect the universe around them in any way.  They would inevitably end up pestering immortals to build things for them or entertain them, when they aren't shuffling around crying about their lost loved ones.  It makese sense that some of the immortal beings would probably take pity on them, trying to make nice little homes to comfort them and keep them amused.  Meanwhile, others would probably just start messing with and torturing them, out of annoyance or simply because it gives them something new to do with the rest of eternity.  Eventually a conflict ensues:


""Hey, stop torturing that poor human, they don't deserve that!  If they're bothering you, let me take them off your hands.  I'm working on a project to find the optimal way to keep them content without bothering us, and they're always lonely and looking for more of themselves.""
""Bugger off goody two-shoes, I'm having fun with them.  Besides, how do you know this human deserves spend eternity being catered to?  Maybe they spent their whole life making everybody else miserable.  That means if you put them in your little ant farm, they'll just make all the other humans there more miserable as well.  Is that fair to the rest of them?""


Eventually, after a while of both sides increasingly fighting over who should get which souls, they seek out one of the most ancient immortal beings to provide arbitration.  Gen thereby helps come up with the point system as an objective way to determine which humans can play nice, and be placed in neighborhoods without making things worse for everybody there.  The beings who want to torture humans will get all the souls that show antisocial and malevolent tendencies, and the beings who take pity on humans get the ones that are most able to live in a self-contained community for all eternity without destabilizing it.  Gen also decides to remain neutral and serve as an arbiter for resolving any future disputes, since she's been around for so long that she's used to just sitting back and watching everything unfold (which translates into her love of binge-watching human TV in the present).  


However, all of that is predicated on the idea that humans do not change after they die, and can never learn how to be more sociable and less self-centered.  Mindy's story was the first time they had any issue with this system, in that she was literally on the precipice of devoting her entire life to helping others and had taken meaningful action toward it (emptying her bank account) immediately before she died.  However, everything was thrown into question when Michael inadvertently created a new paradigm: put toxic humans in what they perceive as ""The Good Place,"" make them feel like they have to learn how to stay there, and (most critically) give them the chance to help other humans become better in the process.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Not that she's from the bad place, and also not from the good place, but is actually part of the test from Gen (but isn't actually Gen).

This is bouncing off the fact that part of what Chidi said made him start to fall for Eleanor was that she anticipated his needs. So here comes Simone, perfect for him in every way, anticipates his needs (Ordering the car etc) and has started to figure out how he interacts with the world. Perfect for him in most ways, but...

She's missing that Eleanor wildcard quality. It's Eleanor who he had the connection with, and Eleanor who pushes him towards Simone, like I assume Gen knew she would. We've seen Eleanor time and time again sacrifice her wants for what others want (Getting into The Good Place being the big one). And with her completely dropping out of the project because she didn't still have her connection with Chidi means that it's not just 'a project' to her, it's 'Chidi's project'. Chidi is her go to example of a good ethical person, so for him to want to toss aside their friendship so easily because it would get in the way of the study, like she were a 'trash bag', must have throw her back into the 'what's the point of being good' frame of mind, because good people suck too (I'm spit balling here, can't get out the words I want to due to 3 weeks of non/improper sleep).

So I think it's going to end again on a series of tests, and for Chidi, it will be Eleanor or Simone, In that it won't be an ethical test, but a big 'Yes Chidi this one absolutely matters' test. Knowing the show they're going to put a twist so it's not the typical woman vs woman test, at which point after his decision is made she'll be revealed to be the judges underwriter or something maybe? (Would explain the not so perfect accent, because my other theory is all of the people from the good/bad places are crap at the Australian accent).

Dax being in hell and recognizing Chidi as being the best torturer. Seems odd to randomly add that to the story line. I think there may be something more there, like maybe the 4 are all demons, deep undercover. I mean who really is being tortured on the show? Michael. He is trying so hard to do a thing, and is thwarted all the time. Is Shellstrop the real devil? 

Another hair brained idea, why is Michael so interested in trying to game the system to get into the good place? Does he think he deserves to be in the good place and is looking for a way to get in? Is he working to try to get a way in so the bad place people can invade the good place?

Think about it. There is no struggle, no pain, no challenges, no achievements to unlock and no psychological demons to conquer. You are given everything you love, want or could ever dream of having. 

**What. Now?**

There is the concept of a hedonic treadmill. Basically:

&gt;"" According to the hedonic treadmill model, good and bad events temporarily affect happiness, but people quickly adapt back to hedonic neutrality. So even if you get what you want, you will eventually go back to the stage where you want ***more***."" 

Another thing to keep in mind all these superior beings (The demons, The angels and The Judge) see humans as weak, stupid and simple creatures. Even though the angels in the Good place want to make humans happy, their simplistic understanding of human nature and the human experience could lead to them presenting a very shallow version of  ""happiness in heaven"" . So there's a chance that the residents in the **Real** Good Place can't lead genuinely meaningful and fulfilling lives, because the journey is over. They have found that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 

I think it would be a fun twist if our gang actually gets into the Good place and it turns out that they are ***even more*** miserable in the actual good place than the bad place that Micheal made for them, because at least in Micheal's bad place everyone had a personal struggle or purpose. I think the recurring line in Season 2, ""It's all I have ever wanted"" could be foreshadowing because once Micheal gets what he ""wanted"", he risks sending the very people he has grown to care about to a more tortuous bad place.

Anyway, Im in the middle of S1 E7 (the episode Michael talks about retiring, Tahani plans his retirement party, and we see some of Chidis life) and I feel like Im noticing some pretty substantial plot holes. 

For example, Chidi seems to be in a place in the US working at a university, and he has the exact same accent and speaks English just as he does in the Good Place. I swear in the first episode he mentions he doesnt speak English and hasnt really been to the US and the Good Place only translates for him.

In the same flashback, he burdens who appears to be a serious girlfriend in the middle of the night with his ethics dilemma over the boots. Again, I swear he mentioned hes never really had a relationship before.

Am I misremembering something? Are these noticeable missteps in the story? Am I discovering that Chidi has been lying about his past?",10,1,False,self,,,,,

The judge commented in a recent episode that, as a result of the main characters getting a second chance at life, several aspects of the world has changed - including that the Jaguars are good now. Yet, if the show recognizes that there are many changes in the world, then what happened to the world that existed before they were resurrected? Since the judge acknowledge such large changes in the world occurring, wouldn't it be safe to assume that someone may have died earlier or lived longer as a result? If theoretically, someone died and went to the Good Place in the world where Eleanor dies by shopping carts, but lives longer in a different world, then would they disappear from the Good Place when the new time contingency starts, or would there be two of them? What if that person, when they lived longer ended up killing a bunch of people, and then should be in the Bad Place?

(Season 3 spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9n3oyy/whole_show_discussion_xpost_from_rfantheories_a/,NateKolker,1539206695,"This theory is a little over the top but just stick with me here, ok?

I havn't found any evidence against this theory and it's mostly because the actual good place is such a mysterious place in this show. My idea is that the good place and the people in the good place know exactly what is going on. They know how flawed the point system is, they know how torturing people isn't going to make them better, and they know that people deserve a second chance. A push in the right direction perse.

Now, this is where it gets weird. (Not too weird. Yet.) I was watching the show and I was asking myself: This system is so flawed and the Angel's from the good place know about it and aren't doing anything about it. Then I realized: They were. They saw Micheal's plan as a chance. What if instead of actually torturing each other, the moral philosophy professor could help them and they could all help each other. Then I was asking, why would Michael be needed for all of this in Season 2? He's a demon, right?

Then I realized, what is better proof that this new system of afterlife works, then literally turning a demon into an angel? They let Michael steal a Janet. They saw something in those four people that no demon could ever see, and took advantage of that mistake. Think about it, you're an amazing person and you get into the good place. You're having a great time but then you realize, there are people being boiled, burned, fried, and eaten AH! You know that they deserved it but THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE. Most of them deserve a second chance. Some people in real life might not agree with this school of thought but at least one amazingly nice person in the good place might think about it. They came to the decision that something needed to change.

They pitched this to the upper good place people and they came to the decision to test it. Like I said, if Michael, a demon can change into a nice being, this has to be able to work. They at least have to try because they are such nice people.

By season 3 they are sold on this idea. They just need to get it by the judge. Annoyingly, the judge has put the 4 people through some sort of earth sim/resurrection thing. That's where Simone comes in. Simone is an angel. This is extremely far fetched and I know it is probably impossible. Maybe she is just a very nice person but if you look in at the dialogue in season 3, you can see that she is defenitly giving them a push in the right direction. I'm sorry that I can't get actual quotes right now, but just giving the MRI machine for Chidi's use and pushing Chidi to get Eleanor when she was going to leave, it seems suspicious.

Imagine, the 4 humans get into the good place and people from the good place go to the judge with proof that this new system works. The demons get made into better people and become  afterlife creatures that make groups of these 2-8 people. Those peoole get resurrected and get a small push in the right direction.

P.S. I have been also thinking that good Janet has been pushing them in right direction and knows exactly what is going on because she (it?) is a good place spy.

P.P.S. What ties this theory together (in my opinion) is that how would amazing people just have a great time for eternity without ever thinking about other people?!?!? That part just doesn't make sense to me.

If anyone has a better answer for all of this or a different theory, I would love to hear all of it.  Constructive criticism is great, give me all of it pls. Thanks for reading this giant thing!",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

Total extrapolation - this could mean an even bigger flaw in the points system. If the system were fully automated (as I thought it was before), why would there be a need for the points to be counted by an accountant? It was just a total, automatically spit out at the end of someone's life. This could mean bias, if the accountants have some sort of agenda. Which could further prove Michael's point that the system is flawed. 

Who do they work for? Do they sit on the committee? (I can't remember the name, but some sort of ruling council Shawn thought Michael's success could get him on?) Where do they fit in?

Rolling the same stone up a hill, over and over, only to have to start again from scratch. Forever.

But in Reality, it was Micheal living tat story, trying to make it work, over 800 times. And it always ended the same way. Snap.

Thing is, there was no advantage in S2. No matter how many reboots, they were still in The Bad Place. Now we're on Earth. The Reboots wouldn't work here, not from a writing perspective, but because it throws out the whole point. 

Micheal's challenge was that they would become good people; but with his constant involvement and manipulation; it was an environment every bit as manufactured as the Neighbourhood. Micheal was pushing the same rock, in the opposite direction, and actually getting less results.

When the Judge ruled that they all had to be hands off, Micheal flawed the test. When he did it to counterpoint Trevor, it was acceptable; but then Micheal threw his own limits out; vowing to 'get it right' this time.

If Micheal had succeeded in rebooting them on earth, then they'd have to start over, again. And the thing is, there's nothing to suggest that they wouldn't go on to become awesome people in their individual lives. Micheal wasn't rebooting them to make them good, he was rebooting them because his four humans were stepping off his plan. Again. For the 805th time

Rolling that impossible stone up a hill, only to start again. It is, a literal definition of Hell.

But now we've got a worse one. Tahani is engaged to the male equivalent of... herself. Simone isn't there to see the glowy door; and in about thirty seconds; Chidi is going to say: ""Hey, I know you! You were our waitress at that restaurant... And you're that librarian that convinced me to say yes to Eleanor.""

So now Micheal's only move is to come clean. But once they realize they're being judged, their motivation changes. And thus the Judge's one stipulation to the test is irrevocably broken. They're all terrified of losing their 'moral dessert'.",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

If you're watching it on American network TV (whichever one it's on idk?) then you'd probably know that as ""season 3, episode 1 and 2"" and that seems to be how MOST people on the sub referred to it.

HOWEVER, Netflix just called it ""season 3 episode 1"" and combined it into one long show without a break in the middle, so if you're watching in the UK or anywhere else that the show is on Netflix week in week out then you're **always going to be one episode out in terms of spoiler tags for the whole season**

For example, the most recent episode as of 12th October is called ""The Snowplow"" - the subreddit (and American sources) refer to this as Episode 4, but Netflix refer to it as Episode 3.

Like I would have liked to see the first brain scan session for the characters, or just more of the study and the results in general. We basically know nothing about the study except that it happened.

And the Trevor storyline felt unnecessary, he doesn't succeed in disrupting the study and is killed off almost immediately. Was this just so Michael and Janet would get caught redhanded? It seems like the judge could have caught them for a number of reasons.

It might be a coincidence, she might be nothing more than a genuinely good human being simply doing good things.

Then 3 months and 3 more months pass, which makes it March 2018. After that they just do 6 months more and now I think it would be September 2018 in the show.

Also Ive felt like theyve been rushing a bit this season. I loved Seasons 1 and 2 and I like Season 3 so far, but it feels weird.

I loved Everything is Bonzer!, because Team Cockroach gets together again. And then Trevor came (but I wouldve been more excited if NBC didnt spoil it) but I was cheering hooray, waiting for next weeks episode.

Then The Brainy Bunch came and I genuinely got upset and sad that everyone, except Trevor, was feeling uncomfortable and Eleanor wanted to leave. Eleanor confesses that she only really came for Chidi and Chidi convinces her to stay. Trevor was a total ash-hole. But then I got really excited again, because Gen found out what Michael and Janet were doing. Trevor goes into a dark void, and Michael and Janet escape with the help of the Doorman. Gen really had me terrified for the team. But it was an okay episode because I was actually discomforted but Im assuming that was the point, and also... another twist. Yay?

Then The Snowplow comes and Im excited to see what Michael and Janet come up with meanwhile their time on Earth. And I really liked Janets comments about random peoples lives, that was funny. But they literally watched Team Cockroach in a vacant university room. The group interacts fine but then a year passes out of nowhere and I feel like nothing really improved with the group, just that Eleanor has really bonded well with everyone else but no one else feels the same way. Then Tahani is going to have sex with Jason, which Michael and Janet meddle in (I know the meddling and interference is a huge point this season) and they make Tahani fall in love with Larry Hemsworth (the non-famous Hemsworth ). That ruins their plan even more because Tahani is going to leave. So my thoughts at that moment were that everything was going a little fast. But then Eleanor, with the help of Michael, voices her opinion about the group and they all reject. I felt genuinely bad for Eleanor, because weve been with this group for a long time, and they have too, but they dont know it. Eleanor throws her tantrum and leaves. Simone calms her down and Eleanor apologizes to everyone. Okay, so what just happened... wheres the bond that they formed that only Eleanor seems to have? But I trust the writers and Michael Schur, so I rub it off. Michaels constant meddling has me shaking my head and then the group finds Michael and Janet at the portal. WHAT! Okay, geez now Im pumped up again. But in the end, I felt like it was rushed.

Also, Simone is a great person. She belongs in The Good Place.

I just remembered, what was the longest timeline of Michaels Neighborhood? Because if it was 11 months like I remember, then, that did a better job of bonding the team than the year that we dont see in Season 3.

TL;DR : I felt like some parts of the last 3 episodes have been rushed even though they were still good in my opinion. I just felt some plot was missing that was necessary for the actual plot of the episode. Also 2 years have passed since 2016. Sorry if this was too long.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

[3x04 - Jeremy Bearimy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8601210/?ref_=ttep_ep4) \- not much hint here, but Ken Garoo is the cashier guy from where Janet bought lottery ticket.

[3x05 - The Ballad of Donkey Doug](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8534442/?ref_=ttep_ep5) \- only some random names here, but since the synopsis said that Jason is going to Florida in this episode, they might be Jason's or Donkey Doug's friends/dance crew members.

[3x06 - A Fractured Inheritance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8564998/?ref_=ttep_ep6) \- Not sure who that new character is, but I think she's some kind of an Olivia Newton-John impersonator... based on the name.

[3x07 - Reboot 445\*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8488908/?ref_=ttep_ep7) \- Now this is interesting. Seems like we're seeing Eleanor's mom and Tahani's family here. Might be flashback since one of the character is ""Young Kamilah"". What's more interesting is the titlewhat's the connection between them and the reboot? I think the cast list is more suitable with episode 6, based on [this synopsis on TGP Wikia](http://thegoodplace.wikia.com/wiki/Chapter_33:_A_Fractured_Inheritance).

*3x08 - this page is empty*

[3x09 - Don't Let The Good Life Pass You By](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8578788/?ref_=ttep_ep9) \- Bambadjan and Val! We might be going back to the afterlife at this point, or a flashback, or the brainy bunch is still on earth but we'll see what's happening in the afterlife. Also, there's something weird: on Netflix, this episode title is for 3x08, but in IMDB this is the title for 3x09. But 3x08 is empty, so this page might be for 3x08? I don't know.

[3x10 - Janet(s)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8601222/?ref_=ttep_ep10) \- The Accountants! We might be seeing them after all. And Eleanor 5? Not sure what's happening here.

I don't know how to pitch this show to a friend because the story and the settings keep changing every episode. It's a wild ride, but you don't have to be that fast. A year from now I won't be able to remember exactly what story was going on in a specific episode!

I had a theory about where the show could ultimately go with the story and I wanted to share.

It's interesting to me that Michael has always been a middle-management character, although for the first season of the show, he lied about which side he was on. It also seems possible that Michael himself may be lied to by his higher ups in the afterlife. There are clearly other beings in this universe with more powers than Michael. Like the humans he has grown close to, he recons with his own lack of morality - the fact that he is endlessly torturing people that would have been good had the right set of chance circumstances happened: meeting other people that challenge us to become a better version of ourselves and work on the ways in which we make others' lives worse. By having Michael show up for his friends in ways that didn't directly benefit himself, he is going through a parallel process to the humans in the Bad Place. 

Perhaps he is being tested the same way the humans are being tested at the end of season 2. This would fit with others' theories that Michael was allowed by the higher ups to steal a Janet. Janet is a feature of the afterlife's infrastructure in the fake good place and presumably what Michael believes about the real good place, but that may not be a complete lie. Janet does seem to nudge Michael in a particular direction or cause him ethical dilemmas with her actions. 

In this universe, *the good place* isn't one of the extremes of heaven or hell but a loop in which there are no easy answers, no point totals determining anything, and death is not an out - it's up to you to put in the work to solve through what is holding you back from connection with others no matter what plane of existence you're on or role you fill. 

What I like about this idea is that it would mean that Michael's speech to Eleanor in the very first episode is actually (and unintentionally) accurate: the true reality is that no one major religion got it correct, but it includes many ideas from these religions. A few examples I can think of (though I'm not a world religion expert): 1. The process of morality playing itself out seems very similar to Buddhism, as does the importance of self-reflection; 2. The hierarchy of beings seem similar to Christian Gnosticism; 3. The warring between deity-like figures is similar to Greek and Roman Paganism.

I won't pretend that this definitely is how it will go down, but I sure would be honored to share positions with Doug Forcett, as someone who got it 92% accurate. One thing's for sure: I'm always blown away by the turns of this wacky, lovable show."")",2,1,False,self,,,,,

1. the last episode and the episodes before have some similarities with S1. Eleanor giving a speech and lashing out, Her admitting that she + Jason are trash, shoving her hand in the cake, Eleanor still believing that Chidi and Tahani are good people or at least better people than her. We basically see the humans being the people they were in michaels neighborhood. We don't see any way that they have improved and to me I don't think they have. Lastly, the episode ended with them about to find out what's up with the after life. Not sure what any of this means but some of this stuff has to be relevant right?

2. Michael doesn't see why his meddling is not working. S3 is about about what michael is doing to make sure the humans stay together and study as team. However, the reason why they all got better in his neighborhood is because he kept throwing all their worst nightmares at them and the neighborhood had way less variables than Earth. Now that Michael is actually helping them succeed, they are not getting the chances to show improvement like before. 

I may be overthinking this, or maybe this means nothing at all but I thought that the way all the seasons relate to each other was interesting. Now that Michael and Janet are caught, I'm not sure how the season will progress but I'm almost certain that the key to the teams success is to have Michael learning with them. They all really bonded together and team cockroach started because Michael was in trouble and got caught by the humans so maybe they'll join forces again? Michael and Eleanor's relationship is my favorite, would love to see more of their shenanigans

The chalkboard in the same room had a list of some positive and negative actions under each of the human's names. Here's a selection: 

######Eleanor

* Flips off anybody

* Believes in kindness

* Lies to friends and loved ones

######Chidi

* Decides to be indecisive

* Confuses others

* Exhausts freedom of thought

######Jason

* Crime is not always the answer

* Violence

* Grand Theft Auto

######Tahani

* Black market purchases

* Constant positive affirmations

* Charity for others

One flyer in the bathroom says ""HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN???"" With a sketch with a question mark where the face should be. Could it be... The Librarian, from the Library?

When Michael and Janet buy the scratchcard, an advertisement in the back says ""That's not a jackpot, This is a jackpot!"" That was one of at least five adverts for scratch-off cards on the windows.

Micheal and Janet celebrated Christmas and Hanukkah with hundreds of decorations, gingerbread houses etc., while the gang just had Chinese take-out and Eleanor wore some tinsel.

In the opening scene with the gang they are studying Nicomachean ethics and they each have their own text book. Six months later, Nicomachean Ethics is still on the top of Jason's pile of books.

While the gang was studying moral philosophy, Larry Hemsworth was reading *You're Not So Bad; A Guide to Building Confidence for the Hopelessly Mediocre*.

Jason's cut-off jeanshorts can be seen briefly during one of the timeskips. The pockets do hang out just a little bit.

The picture on the cake was the one taken at the beginning of the episode. (That's more of a major plot point than an easter egg.)

The exit sign in the Australian bar where Tahani meets Larry Hemsworth had a red EXIT sign. Modern Australian signs actually use the [ISO standard *green* pictogram, and prior to that used green lettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_sign#Color_and_design). Green was chosen as the ISO standard because it is thought to generally represent 'Safety' or 'Proceed' which is what you want people to do when they see an EXIT sign in an emergency.

502,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2018-10-16,2018,10,16,5,9ogh33,self.TheGoodPlace,I love this show. I think it's really important.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/9ogh33/i_love_this_show_i_think_its_really_important/,Riddla26,1539635287,"I think Micheal is probably the most challenging, nuanced and complex TV character portrayal to be pulled off since Bryan Cranston played Walter White. For starters.

As the one in the show that starts out at such an extreme end of the scale, I mean he is LIT-ER-AL-Y... [you know...](https://www.purefandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Good-Place-The-Brainy-Bunch-3x02-Judge-Gen-summons-Michael-Janet-and-Trevor.gif)

But his journey so far is the most animated, the most extreme examples of wrestling with an ethical code that is basically an alien language to the guy and Ted Danson just plays it so fantastically naturally that my brain has no problem believing it at all, which is I hope the ultimate compliment you can pay an actor, outside of a fat sack o' cash. 

I'm sure Editing plays a part and it's a testament to the quality of their work that we see only the choicest cuts of Ted's playful but above all sincere portrayal of a being not of this world, but curious about it and fascinated by the human desire to be utterly futile and strive against the eternal darkness of the inevitability of entropy ending the universe, obsessed with ""being good"" when that concept has no basis or ultimate meaning other than making life more bearable for others, and a being of that extreme nature just... falls in love with them. And by extension the audience falls in love with him too. The licking the sweat, the suspenders thing, just amazing from start to finish.

There's something about Ted's performance in this show that really speaks to me. I actually teared up a little when Micheal went through his [existential crisis](http://78.media.tumblr.com/4e2b9404ce574f3428cc5f4eb2d1618d/tumblr_oxqp1nKLte1qh0nwmo3_250.gif), since I go through roughly 2 a month at least these days.

Quite a lot of the show has hit fairly close to home as a deeply introspective person who often feels like an outsider, and I was already addicted to Schur's other brain babies, but this is like, important for people to see and understand what Mike Schur is demonstrating here. When people stop for 5 shirt-forking minutes and think about it, most people would say they want to be good, but how many people think about that as they go about their daily business, absorbed in their own little bubble, insulated from their effect on the world? Not nearly enough. It's why I don't like people, in general.

It speaks to our modern generations in terms everyone should be able to understand these days, without making the Big Bang Theory mistake of turning every principle or physics joke into a throwaway gag made of incomprehensible terms strung together in the most obtuse way possible. The jokes work and they work so well because they are truly a community effort between the writers, actors and everyone in between who makes tweaks and edits and tightens up the script along the way. The jokes advance the story more than the philosophy does, the philosophy is the road the show is on and the comedy is the gloriously funny vehicle.

Originally this post was going to be ""Ted should *finally* get an Emmy"" because of all the jokes on the podcast about ""Emmy Nominated Actor Ted Danson"", but it turns out he already won Outstanding Lead Actor In A Comedy Role in both 1990 and 1993 for his work on Cheers. As well as 4 Golden Globes, an American Comedy Award and the Critics Choice Award for Best Actor In A Comedy Series this year for Micheal in The Good Place.

In fact, he holds the current title of superlative in the Emmy wikipedia page as the actor with the most Emmy nominations in that category... ever.

Michael says it was because his indecisiveness drove people around him up a wall, but that doesnt make perfect sense. If he was still doing good things you would think his point total could still hit the threshold. Chidi wound up in the bad place because his indecisiveness led to him taking too few actions in life. On the playground he doesnt end up picking anybody meaning no points. When planning to be a best man he doesnt make any decisions meaning he missed opportunities for points.

Whether they're exempt from the afterlife's ludicrous point system or because they hit the point threshold for being the best little creatures they can be, they're all there.

Lest you accuse me of being speciesist or point out that humans are animals, it's pretty clear the afterlife treats humans as different. The demons have to get human suits, think about what tortures work best for humans, etc. In the show's universe, humans are special. 

So at what point did humans start getting judged for entrance to the afterlife? What about Neanderthals or Denisovans? Frankly  I'm sick of shows depictions of the afterlife skirting these issue. Even if the Good Place isn't bursting with doggies and kitties and swarms of bees (it definitely is), it still begs the question of what exactly counts as human enough to be morally judged.

Long time reader, first time poster here! After my latest binge rewatch of the entire series thus far, I think that I might just be finally putting the pieces together on where we may be headed with this season.
(There are spoilers up to season 3 below, so please read at your own risk!)

So we have been shown already last season that as a cosmic being, Gen has great power over the universe and abilities more on par with that of Janet than any of the other beings we have seen. For Eleanors test she was able to create a false Chidi, who looked like Chidi and even acted like Chidi to an extent. At first Eleanor couldnt even tell the difference between the real Chidi and Gens Chidi. Id also like to make note of the fact that Gens Chidi was somehow very clearly physically real because Eleanor was able to touch him.

Now I have seen it mentioned on here by others that the gang spent an awful long time in the Bad Place due to the constant reboots that they were submitted to. An approximation of the time spent there can be inferred from Michaels chart that shows the shortest reboot was only a few seconds and the longest lasted for several months. Which would mean that they have been in the bad place for at least 100 years, possibly even much longer.

That being said, I am not entirely sure that the gang is actually on Earth again as they know it. Rather than being brought back to their original lives, perhaps they were somehow placed in some sort of alternate timeline or some world based off of Michaels neighborhood idea and constructed by Gen.

Another aspect that I think could come into play with Gens plan is the often mentioned but thus far unseen Accounting department. So we finally have confirmation now that the Accountants are in charge of tallying the points accumulated by humans on earth, whether theyre positive or negative. Obviously the gang is a special case and has intrigued many of the non-human characters on the show. What if because theyre such a special case that the crew is assigned their own Accountant for this very project? If this is the case, I believe that Simone could very well be their Accountant. She could even be the head of the whole department. Regardless, I believe that she will play an important role and that shes just a little too good to be true and to be human.

So what do you guys think? Where do you think the season will take us?

- 
TDLR; I believe that it is a possibility that the gang is not really on Earth again, and are actually in another sort of test being administered by Gen and possibly the Accounting department in tangent. This time however even Michael and Janet are being tested as well, and not in on the secret plan. Also since the Accountants have been mentioned yet once again this season, I think that its even possible that they are working with or for Gen. Perhaps Simone is the head of the Accounting department, or the accountant in charge of their case. I have a feeling that whatever she is though, isnt quite human.",3,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

My mind automatically started to wonder if they started telling others the rules of the Good Place would it also doom them. They could potentially doom all of earth and then The Judge would have to change the rules for entry (because Bad Place overpopulation?).

I dont even think people would have to believe them. Lets say they (Janet) wrote a fictional book (or tv show if they want to get meta) about their experience, once people read it they would become doomed (It would be like watching the tape from The Ring). 

And to bring it back to the pilot, they would probably replace the photo of Doug Forcette (the stoner whose photo was in Michaels office who predicted 92% of the afterlife while high on mushrooms)  with a photo of the 4 humans.

Hopefully that made sense....

It gives us a return to the second half of S1 and the second half of S2.

Intentions mattered in S1. When Eleanor tried to sacrifice herself to the Bad Place, she suddenly got more than enough points to be good. She just couldn't stay 'in heaven' to do it. 

Then S2 happened, and Eleanor actually passed the test; only she couldn't bring herself to 'go to heaven' because she'd already set the terms of the test. ""We all go together."" If she cut them loose, she'd be a bad person again.

And now, here we are again. She's Given Up on Going Up. But if there are people she cares about, and she dedicates herself to getting them to The Good Place; then it's because she genuinely wants good for them. But if she ever, even once, says 'I deserve to go with them', then she's stuffed.

See, this is why people hate moral philosophy.

I like the way everyone reacted to the news. It's the: ""You have one week to live"" question. What do you spend it doing? Tahani suddenly loses interest in her money, and decides to go crazy. Eleanor spends her day helping a total stranger, because she just can't not, no matter how much she wants to. Micheal takes the long view. Janet helps Micheal do it. Jason is totally unchanged in personality.

But the really interesting one is Chidi. The guy who can't handle making a 'sundae' because there are 'too many choices', just goes through a day without making a single choice. Here's a sprinkler. Toss your shirt away. I'm hungry. What do I eat? Whatever's most disgusting on the shelf. Can't shop without a shirt? Here's the nearest one.

What's your brand of entire life philosophy? Well, after studying 2500 years worth of thinking on the subject, I've just picked one right now. Class dismissed.

But that scene was done incredibly well, because while he was decrying every branch of morals as pointless, his class had neatly fallen into one branch apiece. All of them in character; to the point where I am truly convinced that each character is designed to follow one of those life philosophies as an endgame. Another nod to Mike Shur and the amazing clarity of how this show is written.

So. Team Cockroach is now the Soul Train. Tahani has to get Larry into the Good Place, and she's starting by stomping on his heart. i have to assume Chidi will do the same for Simone. Eleanor... I'm honestly not sure. Is she going back to her dirtbag friends? Who else has she got?

In last night's episode, Chidi gave his students a really quick summary of three classical schools of thought on ethics: virtue ethics, consequentialism (aka: utilitarianism), and deontology, in that order.

However, he neglects to mention that utilitarianism is a much younger framework than the other two, with its first major (Western) proponent being Machiavelli. Yes, THAT Machiavelli.

Science fiction writer and Renaissance Italy scholar Ada Palmer has a wonderful series of posts on her blog about the context in which Machiavelli developed utilitarianism, and it has really good, thorough discussions of all three ideas, so I wanted to share them here. There are 6 posts in total and each are a few thousand words long, but they are soooo worth the time.

In case you need more convincing, here's an excerpt from part 2:

&gt;Care to spend a fun evening with your friends? Sit around picking interesting characters from various pieces of fiction and discussing whether they based their decisions on deontology or virtue ethics. This game brings endless delight, especially if youre the sort who enjoys slotting various characters into the old Dungeons &amp; Dragons Alignment Grid, sincethiscategorization system is actually universally applicable, and leads to many fascinating distinctions and telling disagreements. You will also notice a pair of general patterns, at least in popular fiction of the last few decades, (1) that good guys tend to be more dominated by Virtue Ethics, and bad guys by other motives, and (2) the author or scriptwriter (very common in movies) tends to assume the viewer will judge the characters based primarily on Virtue Ethics.

&gt;**Test cases:**

&gt;**Batman.** Absolute commitment to never using lethal force: deontology. (Unless we think he refrains from killing out of fear of what killing would do to his moral character.)

&gt;**Spiderman.** Uncle Ben was killed because of Peter Parkers selfish and vengeful impulse in that moment he let the thug go instead of using his powers for good. Why, then, does Peter dedicate himself to fighting crime? If it is because he has come to an absolute conclusion that with great power comes great responsibility, i.e. he is morally required to, that is deontology. If it is because he hopes to redeem the flaw in his character which led to his selfish decision, it is Virtue Ethics at its most habit-of-virtue Aristotelian.

&gt;**Average Disney Hero.** Battles villain to save princess, then villain conveniently falls off a cliff. The virtue ethicist remains content that no shadow is cast on the heros character. Hooray, we have neatly dodged any and all possible moral complexity!

&gt;**Calaban.** Prospero enslaves him and seizes control of his native island as punishment for Calabans attempted rape of Miranda. Virtue Ethics says Calaban is a horrible and malicious being, and that this punishment is just (unless you have a super-charming actor playing Calaban). Deontologys answer depends on which of several different rights/laws the individual deontologist considers primary. Right of Conquest? If so, Prospero can do whatever he likes to Calaban. Right of sovereignty? If so Prospero is a wicked invader. Right of benefactor, to punish the ungrateful Calaban to whom Prospero taught and gave so much? Then Prospero is in the right. Right of host, to punish the ungrateful Prospero whom Calaban welcomed to his island? Then Calaban is in the right. Right to punish the terrible crime of rape? Only if the deontologist in question believes in some specific absolute code by which rape is criminal in this specific circumstance.

&gt;**Sherlock Holmes.** Tendency to bend the rules and let criminals escape when he thinks they are good people or generally should not suffer the vengeance of the law: Virtue Ethics. Or is it? In the case of the Blue Carbuncle, Holmes states I am aiding a criminal, but I may be saving a soul. Is this an application of religious deontology against law-code-based deontology? In the self-defense killing of The Abbey Grange, Holmes goes through the formula of an impromptu trial before releasing the homicide who he fears would be wrongly convicted in a real trial. Even when he burgles the master blackmailer Charles Augustus Milverton, he invokes the (deontological) duty of a gentleman to aid a lady in distress as his moral justification. Our perfect analytical reasoner walks a fine and subtle line on the edge of what feels like comfortable, emotional Virtue Ethics, but it is hard to catch him actually outstepping the bounds of what he would surely call universal rules of right and wrong. Holmes has, of course, enjoyed many versions, and I encourage everyone (especially fans of the Sherlock TV series) to examine how his ethics vary variant by variant.

&gt;**Personal favorite for this exercise: Darth Vader.** [Do I really need a spoiler warning for this?] He betrays his master the Emperor to save his son. The film presents this as redemptive, and his spirit moves on to the vague glowy-person positive Manichean afterlife of the Star Wars special effects universe. Hooray. Virtue Ethics supports this absolutely, since the morally good side of his character has won out, even after so many evil deeds, proving him good inside. What about the deontologist? If we believe that an apprentice owes true fealty to his master, then this betrayal is a wicked act. If we believe that the fathers drive to protect his child is a natural and universal bond deeper than law, then this killing-in-defense is a good act. If we believe the Emperor was the legitimate ruler of the Empire and that its laws are binding, then this treason is a wicked act. If we believe the Emperor is a tyrant who has unjustly displaced the rightful Republic, then this tyrranicide is, potentially, a good act. What if the general Sith lifestyle says the apprentice is supposed to kill his master to take his place? Then Darth Vader is a lazy bum, and shouldve done this a long time ago. This is but one of many occasions in which Hollywood presents a narrative which is simple and easy to judge using virtue ethicswhich is presumed to be the default in todays audiencebut much more complex if deontology rears its head.

Now, she and the gang know the good place exists but thinks that there is no way they can get in because any effort would be corrupt. Nonetheless they continue to be kind, not only that they will go on to try to get their friends and loved ones into the good place.

  

Being kind in the face of certain eternal damnation means that their motives are now not corrupt, their good actions will continue to incur points.

While time in the real world is linear, time in the afterlife is Jeremy Berimy. The key to remember is that Michael notes points in the modern timeline, happening one after another. For the afterlife however, Michael did no such thing as time does not flow across the line fluidly. Instead, time is everywhere, unless it's no where. 

  
In other words, time in the afterlife exists separately from in the real world. If we think of time in the afterlife as time in the real world, time in the real world can be thought of as a video. This is why the judge can choose at what point in the video to continue at. Therefore, anything that's happened in the afterlife has happened and can't be undone, and will continue to happen at a certain pace regardless of what point the ""video"" in the real world is running. This also means that real Eleanor will never meet dead Eleanor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Wait, so what happens if a demon and Janet are in the real world and the judge decides reset the timeline and enter the real world a year before the demon and Janet arrived in the real world. Whatever influence the judge has on that world would cause a chain reaction of events generating a world different from when the demon and Janet entered. Thus, this would cause a branch in the multiverse where the world the demon and Janet would exist would be separate from the world where the timeline was reset by the Judge?

For me, even though working out is a coping mechanism it's also a double-edged sword since a lot of my anxieties do stem from body issues, so in fact I *do* have issues trying to choose my workouts, times to go to the gym, freaking out if I'm not doing an exercise perfectly enough, etc. For Chidi, since he doesn't seem to care about seeming physically attractive, he might actually be in a better place to go with a workout regimen without becoming super anxious about the regimen itself, if the only purpose it serves him is physical health and/or a stress relief.

And look, of course Chidi would go for a coping mechanism that involves 0 reliance on other human beings, unlike, say, talking about your feelings and being honest even when you think you might hurt someone else. 

My various theories: 

* He got into working out because he couldn't let himself turn down an invite to the gym out of terrified politeness, so he might be doing some routine someone showed him once in college because consciously or unconsciously he understands it helps him calm down.

* The stress coursing through his veins 24/7 led to some health problems, and a doctor recommended a specific exercise regimen that he sticks to because he respects medical advice and understands that hypertension, for example, is Bad and should be avoided. 

* He literally just had a moment of clarity where he realized working out did help him feel at least a little bit better AND involved remarkably little chance of hurting other people. Probably he has a home gym or works out at nights to avoid interacting with anybody else. That'd also explain how he finds the time, which is another issue folks have brought up. 

* Relatedly, we know he's a sleepless man, and (again, probably on medical advice) he tries to tire himself/his brain out with heavy physical activity.

* Stress-induced night terrors make him flail his limbs in muscle-generative ways, idfk. 

* Or even if it's the exact same agonizing challenge to decide on what to do at the gym as choosing a muffin, every time, and he only goes like once a week, maybe he just has really good genetics, like some people in my life who don't work out particularly frequently but are still swole as hell somehow just from breathing.

tl;dr I think that while Chidi Anagonye's ripped-ass bod did come as a surprise miracle from Jesus, it is still completely in line with everything we, the audience, have been told, and also because I project onto this particular fictional character like no other it makes sense to me. thanks for coming to my TED talk",7,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's just like when Eleanor decided to leave for the bad place in S01 and got all the points for her good deeds (apologized and got everyone the ""pobody's nerfect"" shirts). Precisely because they now think their good deeds won't factor into their afterlife totals, their motivation for doing good has changed from selfish ^""(knowing about the good place and trying to get there)"" to selfless ^""(thinking they're doomed and doing good strictly to help others)"".

Fork, it could be different by the end of the next ep. But I think the way each of them reacted and the way the ep ends is super positive, interesting, and might have huge ramifications to their (and others) afterlife! Also, that manifesto has to come back, right?

Anyway, the fact that Eleanor couldn't shake being a good person is super interesting - coercing the bartender to give her free drinks isn't really bad for anyone, but when it came to returning someone's wallet, and then a bunch of their stuff, she couldn't say no. Also, the end decision she came up with is a total step away from her selfishness.

Tahani actually reflected on her own self-centeredness (also important to note she apparently wasn't told the reason she went to the bad place, she figured it out), which shows a level of perceptiveness to her own actions that she really hasn't explicitly been shown to have. Her methods for doing good are still the same - donate money - but considering her wealth this is actually a super good method. 

Jason is as usual along for the ride, but due to his willingness to go with the flow and the constant jokes made about florida its actually pretty easy to forget the fact that he was in the bad place more of because of the inequality he was born into. Him commenting on this - on what Tahani's wealth could have done fore him - again shows more situational awareness than he's shown in the past.

Chidi didn't necessarily have the same 'continue doing good' reaction that the others did - he kinda shut down. But he made like, a bunch of decisions. Bad, life altering ones, but decisions! And considering he's always been the one who has no bad intent - despite the constant badness his choices or lack thereof make - his break down might have been good for him. Or just gave him an excuse to wear that shirt. Which is also fine.

There decision at the end is, in the scheme of things, a small one, but considering they now think they're hopeless it's a huge one. Sure, if this continues I'm sure it might be argued that their interference in other people's afterlife is cheating, but that super interesting! Also, couldn't it be argued that, since they don't think this will get them anything, they might rack up like, huge afterlife points? We don't even know if knowing on earth changes things - while that's what (I think) Michael said, it's previously been known that only knowing AFTER death changes their ability to change.

Anyway, **TLDR:** \- Eleanor was selfless, Tahani was reflective, Jason showed how his inequality is largely what got him in the Bad Place, Chidi had a break down in which he made a bunch of choices including to strip, and their helping others get into the Good Place could, potentially? Maybe? Help them get into the Good Place (if the Good Place even exists).",1,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The first year of my chronic pain, I stopped giving a shirt about a lot of things. I was Eleanor, looking out for myself alone because the rest of the world was just going to hurt me. 

I watch a lot of shows because I stay in bed a lot because of my chronic pain. It's only The Good Place that has made me think about my life choices, though. As much as I hate to admit it, it made me want to become a better person. But progress hasn't been linear, it follows more of a Jeremy Bearimy path, so I have good days and bad days, and lately, I've been slipping back to my bad days.

So when Chidi had a meltdown and went fill-on nihilist, I was all, ""Fork yeah! Life means nothing and everything sucks!"" It felt so good to be validated.

But then Eleanor goes ahead and basically says yeah, life is pointless but might as well try to make it good for people who still have a chance. It really resonated with me because since getting chronic pain, I keep struggling with finding the point in all this. 

But that's my problem. I keep looking for a point and there is none, at least for me. I'm a nihilist and I think I'll be one for life. But that doesn't mean I can't try. It's more the opposite -- life means nothing so I have to make it mean something. And here I am, back again to trying. Trying to survive, trying to help my fellow sufferers of chronic pain, trying to believe that I can still do something good, trying so that even if I fail, someone else can succeed later.

Ive seen it happen, and it does have ripple effects that can put so much good into the world (which is another theme of the show).

When my wife was in college, she didnt have the money to pay tuition one semester.  Someone connected her with a very generous professor that was known to help students out.  She just flat out gave her $8,000 with no strings attached.  It truly did change her life; she never would have been able to graduate and become a teacher if she hadnt gotten that money.

Fast forward several years, and my wife has become an amazing teacher.  She cares so deeply about her students and would truly do anything for them.  So much, in fact, that she won a Life Changing Teacher Award, which came with a $25,000 cash award.

The very first thing she did was went back to that professor and paid her back.  The professor told her, When I gave you that money, it was a gift, not a loan.  I truly never expected to see that money again.  BUT, Im so glad that you did, because another student just came to me needing help, and I wasnt going to be able to help them, and now I can.  Yet another students life trajectory was changed.

When I saw that scene, all I could think about was how true Jasons statement was, and how so many of those people that they gave money to could have had their lives changed for the better.  The amount of good they could have put into the world in that scene just warms my heart.

Jason and tahani then decide to share tahani's wealth with others, by doing so, in jasons words, giving them an amount of money that can truly change their lives for GOOD. 

Tahani, no longer corrupted by trying to outshine her sister, or corrupted by trying to rack up her good points to get in to the good place, donated 2 million dollars to the opera house, and when they want to dedicate an entire hall to her, she refuses, and remains anonymous, the old tahani, would of jumped at the idea of that. 

Eleanor, can not fight the urge/voice in the back of her head, that voice that she once ignored, through her ethics and lessons, just shines through her now, and she cant help but listen to it. Ultimately helping this man and her daughter come back to that one picture.

And chidi, well that mans just went damn psycho lmfao, (i do want to have a taste of that chili tho .)

Forcing anyone with more of a sense of self preservation to stay silent and to be in heaven but not actually be able to filfull your wishes or ask Janet while everyone else does would be a terrible form of torture. Micheals problem was always that the group torturing each other tips off Elinor, so what happens when the torture is almost entirely self inflicted? Without the 4 Elinor never has an outlet to grow or catch onto being constantly pushed into unhappy situations, and none of the rest of the plot develops. 

As far as I can tell that would stay stable forever for at least Elinor, Chidi and Tahani who would all stay isolated and trapped in themselves.

The four humans characters are damned because they know about the points system. At the moment theyve accepted their fate, but what if instead of sitting back and taking it they try one last big move to try and bring the whole system crashing down?

What if Chiri had explained the afterlife to his students? Would they also be damned? Probably not, because theyd think he was crazy, but maybe that nagging possibility in the back of their minds for the rest of their lives would be enough to invalidate their final score. So what if the guys tried to get the word out in a big way? What if Tahani threw a party for the most influential people in the world and told them all? What if Jason knowledge-bombed an on-site reporter at a Jaguars game? *What if Elenor just straight up started a cult?*

Sure, theyd be dooming people at first, but surely that would only work for the first couple of hundred people. The powers that be can only punish so many humans on a technicality before the veracity of the entire system is brought in to question. What if the gang started a movement, a religion, of the Good and the Bad Places? What if they got the word out to so many people that the entire ethical system on which the afterlife operates had to be completely overhauled? And in the interest of fairness, our guys would have to be judged according to the new rules, essentially giving them a fresh start.

Addendum: I also think that retirement-punishment is just being turned human, and the demons just assume its a classical pain-torture because thats obviously where their mind goes. After all, what would be worse to an infinite being that a finite lifespan full of misery, illness and regrets.

As far as I can tell, it literally ends the show we've known as The Good Place. This new show, whatever it will be, is now totally different.

Consider: The show is marked Chapter 31. Michael Schur has always said he has five years of story to tell. In five, 13-episode seasons, this is approximately (considering some double episodes each season premiere) the halfway point. So there is that physical marker. We're halfway through the story Schur has to offer.

But, of course, it's the epistemology that matters.

Up until the very end of Jeremy Bearimy, the ""sit"" of this amazing sitcom has been: Girl who doesn't belong in what she thinks is The Good Place tries to make it there--and, when she learns she's not there, tries to get there.

But that show is over now. Eleanor, who spent all the episodes until Jeremy Bearimy trying to get to The Good Place, has given up. 

The new show is about her trying to put some good in the world. Not to fake it until she makes it. Not the get into the Good Place. Not for any reward. Just because trying to do and be good is ... good.

Her end remarks are stunning: ""We can try...to do good. Why not try? It's better than not trying.""

That is, I think, the crux of Jeremy Bearimy, essentially a pilot for a new show. A former Arizona dirtbag and her Soul Squad are going to go out there any try to do good because it's better than NOT trying to do good.

In the era of Trump, I look forward to this new show. A show about a medium person, Eleanor Shellstrop, the avatar of us all, is going to try to do good because it's better than not trying.

Damn, that's important stuff. ",20,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's not specified how much, but one would expect that it is considerably less, given their attitudes toward her.  Yet Tahani rejects this money outright, telling Kamilah that she can have it all.

Yet in the most recent episode, ""Jeremy Bearimy"", we find out that Tahani has 131 million British Pounds in her bank account, when she attempts to give it to Jason.

But, because of the whole Jeremy Bearimy thing and the writing of the manifesto, Im wondering if thats what drives Michael to insist on the Brainy Bunch for his experiment? We know the timeline somewhat loops and doubles back in on itself, so what if the manifesto gets finalized and it (or at least part of it, since neither Michael nor Janet seem to have knowledge of anything weve seen on the show so far) winds up in Past Michaels hands, giving him the idea to push forward with a fake Good Place with the four main humans?

I'm 2 episodes in and get an aneurism every time the neuroscientist girl speaks. I heard that she's a British actor or something trying to imitate... some accent but come on, ya never trust a pom to get an Aussie's job done ;) But seriously, if she's working at a university just have her speak with a British accent; most Australian professors at uni don't have a rural accent let alone whatever accent she's trying to pull so a British accent would not only be better but also more accurate (the older generation here usually speak with a 'cultivated' accent as opposed to the often portrayed 'broad' accent). On a semi-unrelated note, uni professors here come from all around the world. I'm in my second year and already have had Italian, American, Chinese, Japanese, British and Norwegian non-language lecturers/tutors so there's no problem with just retaining the actor's original accent. It would not at all be disrespectful; the secondary Australian characters already give us enough of a shoutout.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I do want to say I'm glad that they're repping my country in such a big TV show. But the most logical thing to do would be:

1.   Get an Australian to play the part of the neuroscientist. After all they are filming in Australia, shouldn't be too much to expect a couple of Australian talents in lead roles. But they already have a few in secondary roles so understandable if they couldn't find a suitable Australian for that specific role.

OR

2.   Have the characters speak like normal people with their natural accents. Not far off from reality in Australia since our university scene is actually pretty diverse so finding Americans or Brits there would not be surprising or inaccurate.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my vent. All in all, interesting premise for a TV show and I really wanted to keep watching but am honestly afraid that the neuroscientist girl will come up again. If there's a way to avoid listening to her without skipping half the plot I'll start watching again but this is legitimately such a big problem.",15,1,False,self,,,,,

As Chidi is recapping the three ways to live an ethical life we see an image of Jason and Tahani for the first (Virtue Ethics), then Jason and Tahani again for the second (Consequentialism), and finally Eleanor for the third (Deontology). This immediately struck me as odd because in this situation, for the symmetry, I would expect three different people/groups. It was weird to me to show J &amp; T twice. Virtue Ethics made sense for them, but consequentialism seemed like a stretch.

Flash forward to today and I finally listened to this week's. They reveal that this episode actually has a missing ""fourth"" plot line that would have followed Michael and Janet. (Bonus that we will get to see that in the extended episode!) This episode makes of point of Eleanor including Michael and Janet by saying ""The six of us"" So I think it's reasonable that we should be expecting their journey's to mirror our humans. So, my theory is that Michael and Janet's missing storyline will in fact be a story of Consequentialism that would have let images from that subplot be used during Chidi's explanation of ethical living, thus having a pretty symmetry for the entire episode and bringing Michael and Janet more in line with the humans growing ethically.

I don't understand why all these good and decent people are so relaxed about billions of people who never did anything evil burning in 'The Bad Place' until the end of time. Eleanor was the only person to realize there was something terribly wrong about all of it and Chidi just remarked that 'apparently that's not how it works'. I feel like a good person or even a normal person would get explosively angry at Michael. It makes me wonder what his moral philosophy is.

Likewise, I don't think the show can sustain with the characters on Earth. So here's my theory as to what's currently going on, and what's going to happen, either at the end of this season or at the end of the show.

1. Michael is human. Michael is in the bad place, and his torture is having to torture others, but especially failing at his job. Most of the show has been Michael trying to fix a problem - having to reboot neighbourhoods, keep things from his boss, deal with coworkers - all while constantly faced with the threat of retirement. On top of this, Michael constantly refers to how much he loves human things. He's been tricked into thinking he's a demon to see if he can be redeemed, even when put into a position of evil.
2. Janet is God. Janet is everywhere and anywhere. She is both good and evil. She is the only character that can create things out of thin air, and she has created man (Derek). She has often referred to not being a woman, a robot, and at one point said ""I don't even know what I am anymore."" Her powers don't work on Earth because she knows she can't make her powers known to mortals.

I'm not sure about the four main characters. I've gone back and forth on them not being real, actually being demons, being representations of sin, being part of an afterworld Stanford Experiment, or just being in purgatory and facing a test of where they will spend eternity.

Of course, 100% possible that I'm way overthinking it.",9,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

The Enneagram tells us we each have a core fear that will be a defining struggle of our lives. Chidi isn't a bad guy. His actions were not overtly evil, and he would never want to try to hurt people. He's doing the best he can, but because of his personality's struggle to commit to and be accountable for his choices, he ends up hurting people by accident. He wants to retreat into his inner world of theory rather than fully engage with the outside world.   


So perhaps the suffering a person causes is the deciding factor for their eternal destiny; but the suffering one causes is directly related to whether they will face their core weakness and fear and choose to grow. ",12,1,False,self,,,,,

It also happens at least twice prior to this. Once when their trying to board the Hot Air Balloon and I can't remember the other time but I believe it was in season 2 also.

What are people's thoughts on it? I would say it extends beyond simply challenging the social norm of the general gender pronoun. Personally I think it might show up later as some type of projection on the show being about Eleanor's experience. Not sure really, that might be a stretch.

And it's not even enough to have a positive score, you have to be in the very top of the top. A vast majority of people don't make even come close.

So with all that, how can they possibly hope to save someone like Pillboi? They basically made him stop the crimes, but he's still waaaay in the negative from all the previous crimes he's done, right? He can get a few points helping the elderly and stuff but that's still just his job. It's pretty much guaranteed he still loses more points doing average Florida Man things outside of work hours. Like he's clearly no selfless saint who gives up all possessions to help the starving kids and from what we know these are the type of people who get in the good place.

I mean just look at Chidi, he spent his whole life trying to weigh every single action he did to try to do the most ethical thing in every decision, and in the end being too indecisive doomed him. So how can Pillboi top that, having spent his whole life with a mindset where robbing 3 factories in a single night seems like a good idea?

I don't know about you guys, but given the rules at play, the efforts of the Soul Squad seem basically futile. They'd have to spend decades on Pillboi to get him the right push to be a proper good place worthy person. And even then, I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled a corrupt motivation type thing and dismiss his good deeds as something he only did because of external influence from the Soul Squad

But at the same time, I don't want to believe we just ""wasted"" a whole episode trying to save Donkey Doug, then casually dismissing his fate of eternal torture as a sure thing (like literally, *eternal horrible fucking torture* and Jason barely cares lmao) only to then try (and likely fail) to save Pillboi from that fate.

So do the best of the best really go to TGP? Is it a preselected percentage? In season 1s fake neighbourhood it almost came off as a competition where only the top scores ended up there. If thats true, then it kind of brings about a futility in trying to make the world a better place if space is limited and your goodness is quantified as a quotient.
Back in my philosophy class when I was in college, we discussed the relativism of morality and how in a perfect society, there would still be crime but what would be labeled as crime would be different just like how different cultures have different beliefs on acceptable behaviour (human sacrifices and cannibalism have been considered ethical to different groups throughout time for example). So if we were all near perfect but it was a quotient, would you go to the bad place for something like jaywalking?

And **season 3 spoilers**
If the soul squad succeeds in saving the souls of the people they care about, would that take a spot away from someone whose score they surpassed? What are the ethics in that? This is how Chidi must feel all the time.

So yeah, do you think theres a select number of spaces or that its like your ethics are being graded on a curve and thus relative entirely to your peers?

There is no afterlife, no demons, no Judge, no time hopping, and none of the characters actually died. They all reached a point of being committed to a technologically advanced new form of group therapy by someone in their lives who recommended them for it. (Chidi's life-long friend who was getting married; the environmental activist Eleanor was constantly harassing; some cop who got Jason out of the safe; Tahani's sister and/or parents). The main four were unaware that they were brought into the program because to know about the program would be to render it unhelpful as they wouldn't participate. (That alone is an ethical conundrum fitting with The Good Place's moral debates.) Through hypnosis or some other kind of pharmaceutical aid, Eleanor, Chidi, Jason and Tahani are really all somewhere else while their consciousness is brought into a virtual reality simulation, not unlike the one that Janet created for Chidi to test his Simone breakup approaches or that Michael was able to craft for Chidi to explore the train problem. The purpose of the program is to study whether or not humans can ethically evolve and, if they can, can they cause something of a good epidemic to counteract negative aspects in society-- basically, at what point is a person irredeemable, if they even are, and what does it take to facilitate redemption and more consistent moral behavior? 

Michael, unbeknownst to him, is also a patient in part of the program's study. The difference is that Michael is given control over others in the study to test whether or not status and power has an effect on rehabilitation. Michael probably was an actual architect at some point and the program is designed for him to believe that he is the creator of the neighborhood and partially in control of the fates of the four humans. The study has effectively convinced Michael that he is a demon, even if he has shown the ability to have human emotions. Furthermore, the show just had Janet give Chidi the same finger-snapping power to change the simulation that Michael has-- and that finger-snapping power is basically the extent of Michael's powers that we've actually seen him exhibit. He can create new parts of the simulation but that's actually about it so far. He also is apparently an all-knowing being but has no idea how to get to the actual Good Place? That doesn't make a ton of sense, along with other aspects of his story-- the ease with which he stole a Good Janet, etc., the way he and Janet keep escaping eternal damnation with relative ease-- which would suggest that Michael is as part of the study as Eleanor, Chidi, Jason and Tahani. 

All of the weird supernatural or time-bendy things that happen in the show-- time-space portal doors, demons who can cocoon up other demons, The Bad Place, everything that happened in the neighborhood-- are part of the virtual reality and not really happening. The characters didn't just go back in time and not die-- they never died in the first place. Donkey Doug, Pillboy, the environmental activist-- these are simulated versions of real people in the Soul Squad's lives but not actually them. A big clue to this is the Judge's test for Tahani, which was set up to show her simulated versions of her parents in order to better her understanding of herself... all while Jason's test was to play Madden football (a simulated sports game in which he participates) and Eleanor's test was to interact with... a simulated version of Chidi. 

This idea would bring up a lot of questions, like: is Simone part of the research staff? Who or what is Janet? etc. but it also could explain a pair of \*really\* big loopholes in the original premise of the series, which is why the storyline in The Bad Place in S1 had Eleanor and Jason as mistakenly brought into The ""Good"" Place whereas Tahani and Chidi were supposed to legitimately be there. You could argue that it is because those studying them and trying to rehabilitate them thought the best approach would be to make Eleanor fight to stay and to tap into her need to belong somewhere. But you can also say that just happened to work out but wasn't the original idea. My feeling is that it was set up this way because there was just more empirical data available for Tahani and Chidi. Consider that Tahani was a public figure her entire life and Chidi, despite being indecisive and awkward, had connections to people who cared about him and ties to educational communities for his entire life. Tahani and Chidi are just easier to research and document than Eleanor (a determined loner who worked a series of under-the-table jobs and joined nothing her whole life) and Jason (who is, well, Jason.) Tahani and Chidi are something of a pair of control variables in the experiment, whereas Eleanor and Jason are the wild cards. Since the researchers could only accrue basic data about them, they had to run with the scenario that they were both there by accident and so created ""real Eleanor"" and Jason's Buddhist monk identities as part of the experiment. 

My bet might be that it's Michael who figures this one out over time. It will affect him the most because Michael was let in  on the first part of the experiment-- that The Good Place is The Bad Place-- and helped to create it but he has no idea that The Bad Place is actually a virtual reality behavioral rehabilitation center and that he is one of its patients.
