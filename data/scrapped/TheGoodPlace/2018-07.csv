[FULL SPOILERS],https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/8wkxno/realised_why_i_didnt_see_the_twist_coming_and_it/,TheDeadlyBeard,1530890590,"So I am laying in bed on maybe my 7th or 8th binge rewatch of The Good Place and I had a bit of a theory, wanted to see what you guys thought about it. Haven't been to this sub before sorry if this is a popular theory already.

So on my first watch through of TGP I really loved the story concept because like most people when I watch TV I like to think about what I would do in those situations. I really connected with all six main characters in different ways, as I'm sure most of you do, because the four main characters are all such exaggerations of certain personality types. However, I really bonded with Chidi and that will become relevant later. I really find the quirky comedy tone mixed with the moments of real emotion and serious discussion about life, morality and reality just really helped me see things in a less serious more comical light through a bit of a dark time while I was suffering from existential crises and serious depression. I enjoyed thinking about how the different parts of my personality would act in the fictional afterlife, but of course some parts of my personality wouldn't get into The Good Place which is why I think I didn't see the twist coming. Everything made sense and even though I don't believe in an afterlife I would like to think that I am overall a good person. The aspects of my personality that I shared with Chidi have been a very relevant factor in my life recently, especially at the time of my first viewing (I have G.A.D.) I would like to think that  anxieties and indecisiveness don't necessarily make you a bad person, so I had no reason to think there was any reason why he would deserve to be in The Bad Place. And although I very much dislike people like Tahani, I can still believe that she would get in too. Once I realised this it made the twist a little disappointing because Chidi's character focuses so heavily on his anxiety. It made me think that maybe other people have connected with certain aspects of characters and also didn't see it coming for a similar reason. 

So here's where I think the show will go. There is no such thing as The Good Place or The Bad Place. The entire experience is a way for the four main characters to right the negative aspects of their personalities before moving on to an afterlife for everyone. Everyone has to go through it and the worse a person you are, the harder it is, hence why Eleanor and Jason are in a more slighty more stressful situation than Chidi and Tahani during Season 1.
  
The main thing that kind of ruins it a bit is the scenes not involved the main characters make a little bit less sense, particularly interactions between Michael and Sean. 

I'd like to know what you guys think. I think this theory holds a lot of weight and would be a great way to end the story with another satisfying twist that also leaves you feeling better about yourself.

A couple weeks ago, I got booked to work on The Good Place. /cue happy dance and fangirl screaming

So I figured this sub would be interested in my experience around the main actors and crew of this amazing show.

It started out with a very early call time at the crack of dawn at a location just outside of LA. Nothing out of the ordinary for any TV show. I was sent through wardrobe, hair and makeup (all women in the background wear light pink lipstick or lip gloss as a rule, which apparently helps the light color scheme of the entire show) and then told to wait outside as production was considering using my car in the background of the scene. After an hour or two, it was time to film and my car was ultimately not used so I was invited to come over to the set and watch filming because they were doing an exciting stunt that day. At this point, everyone I've encountered has been super nice, kind and accommodating. 

On set, everyone was there; all the main actors, even though Ted, Manny, and Jameela were the only ones in the scene, were on set, watching and supporting, rather than staying in their trailers even though it was an extremely hot day. This is beyond rare for a TV set--most of the time actors will sit in their trailers until the very last minute and only be on set when absolutely necessary. So filming the first scene of the day goes on and the stunt goes amazing, with Michael Schur hopping out of his producers' tent for a bit. 

Once the scene is finished, we're all sent back inside to our holding (just a large room to hold all the background actors out of the heat) and we prep for the next scene. Since I wasn't in the first scene, I was placed very close to the main actors in this scene. I couldn't talk to them, but I was close enough to hear them joke around between scenes which warmed my fangirl heart. However, one sad thing for me is that to remind the main actors of the context of this scene, the entire main arc of season 3 was announced. The only detail I'm going to tell you is that the scene we were filming takes place in a European airport and there is such high production value within this show that they had converted the American electrical outlets to European style ones. This ended our day of filming at barely noon, but production let us hang around for lunch.

Being allowed to stay for lunch was just the cherry on top of the day since production had no obligation to let us stay around. At lunch, the main cast ate at the same tables that everyone in the production--the crew, the background actors, the security guards, etc--and again, this is extremely rare for productions so it just shows how nice these people are.

Unfortunately, I will not be giving out details of what was spoiled for me because of the paperwork I signed as a term of my employment. Feel free to ask me anything about my job.

TLDR: No spoilers for you guys (sorry for those thirsty for new details!), The Good Place is just a really nice set to work on and working on it made me love this show 100x more. Keep watching the show, we're supporting an amazingly kind and friendly workplace in addition to one of the best shows on TV.",34,150,False,self,,,,,

I saw the list of episode names for Season 3, and I just had a major brainwave!

Doug Forcett! His name is mentioned in two of the titles, so clearly theyre going to meet him. Maybe even make him a major plot point.

So here are my predictions for Season 3: Team Cockroach have met up, and start studying ethics, as expected. How, exactly, they get Tahani and Jason into the Mix, Im not sure.

Option One: Im betting something happens, and Eleanor storms off, or for that matter, thinks to herself : Ive been good for a whole season now, I wanna blow off some steam. Hey look, a Party!""

So she goes, and sits with some Stoners, and they pass around some mushrooms, and then Elanor, reflecting on her ethics lessons and the idea of 'Moral Dessert' suddenly says ""Hey, what do you think the afterlife is like?""

And then this guy sitting next to her says: ""Well, my name is Doug, and when I was a kid back in Calgary, I had this idea..."" and launches into this incredible monologue where he gets 92% of it right, and Eleanor, tripping, staring, losing her mind, suddenly gets struck by the thunderbolt, and Remembers! She remembers The Good Place, Micheal, and Hot Diggity Dog!

Option Two: Based on the thought that the picture of Doug was a producer's choice instead of an actor, (As suggested by the podcast) then maybe there have been many 'Dougs'. (The title of 3x11 backs this up) and there are others who have been 'rebooted' into their life on earth.

So one day, Jason, or Eleanor are passing a joint back and forth, talking about their 'ethnics' classes with Chidi, and Eleanor asks 'Hey, what do you think the afterlife is like?' and Jason launches into the full monologue. Cut to the end of the season, where a random supporting S3 cast member has died unexpectedly, and is met by Micheal. 

""John Smith? Come on in. You, are dead. Welcome to the next phase of your existence.""

""Cool. So, who got it right?""

""Well, the Christians, the Buddhists, all the major religions got it about 5% right. but then there was Jason Mendoza. He was this amateur DJ in Florida, who got high one night, and got it about 95% right, breaking the record of Doug Forcett by 3%.""

""Okay... So, where am I?""

""Well, you're pretty lucky. A few months ago, you would have been in the Good place, or the Bad Place. But then this thing happened with some friends of mine, and we're trial-programming a Medium Place; where you can learn about ethics, and show your colors. It's a way to make sure you end up where you're meant to be.""

""And who are these friends of yours?""

""Well, you'd be surprised actually, you know them.""",15,20,False,self,,,,,

I stuck to my goals, made some hard decisions, felt really happy, content and wholesome-my best version. 

I was quite content with my life until a few weeks back when I started noticing there are people at a better state with far less efforts. It doesnt seem fair(maybe it is the dumbest word humans invented).  And there are always going to be things that can still be worked upon.

I started it on the 10th and finished it on the 11th, It was absolutely amazing.


I was interested in the show after seeing Ideas at Play's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URXF9CF3M-k , no real spoilers in the video if you havent seen the show) and the show did not disappoint. 


First of, the cast has great chemistry together, it's been a long time since I've seen such good chemistry. They also all have great line delivery and good timing for their comedic moments. Furthermore, most of their characters have their own brand of comedy associated to their character which makes the show even more diverse in its comedy. And The Good Place manages to do this without being repetitive. Even characters that we dont see that much feel like characters and not like paper cut outs. All of this is evident in their comedy, dialogue and everything about them and it helps bring every character to life. 


And all of this is without mentioning the actors, who portray these characters so well. Props to every one of them for being so great at their jobs. 


To add to the earlier bit about comedy. I'm not good with comedies in general, for the lack of a better term (I honestly cant think of one at the moment). They dont really click with me and it's usually hard for them to make me laugh. The last thing that made me really laugh was The Nice Guys, so Im really glad that this show manages to be really funny. I think my favorite jokes are the Plato/Aristotle one with Eleanor and the Burrito Judge in S2 since I actually thought the Judge was going to be a burrito because of Michael mentioning the Pancakes earlier. 


To continue, I didnt know about the twist so it really surprised me (I loved *The Laugh* by Ted Danson, it conveys everything we need to know) and after that the show just kept on giving. You have no clue where it's going and thats great for the viewer since the show isnt predictable. Also, it just keeps giving you ideas and story-lines you weren't expecting but what's outstanding is that they work every time, something that doesn't happen all the time in TV. Usually, you would expect an idea to not work out well, but not here. This gives me so much confidence in the cast and crew. They know what works and what doesnt. Schur shows this when he explains why the characters didnt stay in the proper Bad Place longer : We are trying not to stagnate. I'd rather leave a place, or a premise, too early than too late. All of this bodes well for the future of the show, after all it has already managed to reinvent itself more than once already, so it can probably do it again.


Thirdly, I know this may be seen as cheesy by some but seeing people bond and become better people is such a good idea for television. I know it's been done multiple times since thats kind of the point of a lot of stories (seeing the protagonist evolve), but the way it was done here was great. At first you thought it was just going to be Eleanor who learns to be better, and then you start to wonder if things are wrong because of how the main characters act (Jason, Tahani and Chidi). After we know everything, they all have to learn to become the best version of themselves, even Michael. I especially like seeing Michael learn to become better, since it shows us that truly anybody can change. I even grew attached to his character. His answer to the trolley problem had me worried, since I thought it was over for him. Fortunately, Janet managed to evolve as well (this is also great since it goes hand in hand with what Eleanor was telling Chidi about lying).


To add to this, another thing that I feel makes these characters work so well is that in real life it would be so unlikely for all these people to meet and bond. However, because of their situation they are able to bond and grow together. 


I also love the lessons the characters learn at the end of each episodes. It makes the show feel so wholesome. Not to mention, that the atmosphere of the show is wholesome as well, well you know without the whole torturing part. I especially like the color palette and color correction that is used in The Good Place, its warm, with bright colors and makes you think everything is fine until it isnt.


Finally, I unironically love all the philosophical stuff within the show. It manages to convey the ideas concisely. It also conveys them in a way that allows everyone will learn about them. The show also manages to cover different ideas and topics as well so it isnt repetitive. Like one article said, it made philosophy cool. This helps the show stand out. 


Sorry if this is too long, rambly and disorganized, I just wanted to talk with people about this great show. Cant wait for S3 in September. Also, even though more people know about the show now, I still feel like its not as popular as it should be.


I also have had one thing on my mind. How is the turnaround for this show so fast? Im asking this since in recent times more time takes place between seasons. However, it seems as though The Good Place is on the opposite side of this spectrum. Season 1 premiered in 2016 and lasted until early 2017. Season 2 premiered in 2017 and lasted until early 2018. And now Season 3 premieres in September. Is this usual for Schur shows or is The Good Place an anomaly?

P.S. Is this just me not remembering correctly or do they switch the pronunciation of Eleanor from time to time (talking specifically about the *nor* part)

For that, I watched each episode once with English subtitles, then again with Japanese subtitles before moving on to the next. Not an easy thing to do with the awesome cliffhangers at the end of each episode. Side note: this is good tip to follow if you're learning a foreign language and have that option available for shows you want to watch. However, certain jokes about voices such as Tihani's accent don't make as much sense but that's minor. Also, I'm slowly rewatching the first season with my wife and so far she's enjoying it. 

Anyway, before I get into it, I'll admit I did not see the season 1 plot twist coming. This is very surprising given I knew a twist was coming as that was mentioned in the YouTube comics of a cartoon that used The Good Place as a mash-up with Marvel. Even better is that the twist was deserved. However, I think I was the most disturbed at the idea that they can have 80 demons dedicated to torturing 1 human soul. 

Also noted by others, I love how they had cliffhangers on every episode. Pretty sure this is standard now, but man it gets you wanting to play the next episode immediately. I can imagine people binging a season or even both seasons in a day.

I enjoyed the characters, but they all seemed almost too comically flawed. Jason is way too stupid. Tahini is way too conceited, Chidi is way to indecisive, and Eleanor is way to self-centered. I'll be honest, I hated all their pre-death versions as persons when they showed up in flashbacks (funny as hell though). Still, it's a comedy and they tried to temper that extreme as the episodes went on. 

Michael and Janet were great. While Michael had the most growth, like most I enjoyed Janet's antics more. The supporting demons were funny (more so on rewatch). Except Vicky. Fork Vicky. Most importantly, the story did not drag. This same show stretched out to 22 episodes would be a pain to watch with way too much filler. I'm glad broadcast TV is willing to move away that idea since now a show that tells a great linear story will likely be watched more on streaming services. 

Anyway, looking forward to season three and seeing how each of the characters react in the short term to a near death experience (yeah, I know, it's a simulation). I imagine Tahini almost being crushed by her sister('s statue) will impact her the most. Not sure what oxygen deprivation will do to Jason, but perhaps a vision will turn him to becoming a real monk (he seemed to fill that role way too easy). Chidi looks like he became more decisive. I just wonder how Michael and Janet will play into all of this and how their characters will grow. ",2,22,False,spoiler,,,,,

""The point of the show is that the system is bad!"" But actually, I'm reconsidering that. The point of the show isn't actually that the system is bad - though it certainly hints at it. Thus far the show's been playing within the boundaries set by the rules, despite things like Michael extending the fake good place, and everybody marching themselves to the judge by sneaking past demons, and getting re-alived. It's not like they're breaking rules and having whoever's in charge change their minds - they're just breaking rules and sometimes getting yelled at for it. The Bad Place management seem to break rules without a care, unless it helps humans. Therefore the point of the show seems less about the system itself being bad (though that is bubbling there) and more about how kinda shirty people coming together can help them to be good.

Here's the problem I have - ""but that's the point of the show!"" is in response to people talking about how the main characters shouldn't be in The Bad Place. But saying ""the point of the show is to prove the system is bad!"" misses half the point being made, which is that the main characters shouldn't be being treated like bad people at all. The framing of the show makes things like abuse and anxiety seem like personal faults, and that's nothing to do with the system. That's everything to do with the characters and how things are treated within the show. It treats a support system like it can only be specific people (I understand why Team Cockroach are being put together, and I know Eleanor did join a group of Good people after being saved from death, but they clearly weren't friends or helping her personally). When Eleanor gets upset that being good costs her friends and makes her feel unappreciated and tired, she's told she's seeking moral desert and led to Chidi.

I really get that the characters themselves are flawed, complex, and stumbling blindly through ethical conundrums, and that the supposed point of the show is to go ""the system is bad!"" but it kinda hurts when you see someone so clearly not trying to do bad - and who you can see yourself in, especially in the relevant flaws - still (thus far) called a bad person by the narrative.",8,5,False,spoiler,,,,,

1. Why is eating a sandwich +1.04 points? If you eat 3857 sandwiches, it balances out with poisoning a river lol
2. Along the same lines, Lincoln could have poisoned 200 rivers and it would have balanced out with him ending slavery in the US. 
3. After the welcome movie, when Michael is walking with Eleanor, some flowers bloom only as they enter Michael and Eleanor's line of sight. I suppose this is some faux Good Place stuff that allows you to see flowers bloom in real time. 
4. When Eleanor wakes up after the party and sees giant animals, etc. and she says ""Motherforker,"" a giant fork immediately plummets from the sky. 
5. Eleanor has a Michigan Law t-shirt, presumably where ""real"" Eleanor went to school. 
6. When everyone has those blue and yellow outfits, everyone's shoes are one solid color- either blue or yellow, but Janet's is striped blue and yellow.
7. There is a clown costume next to Chidi's chalkboard in this episode. 
8. When Eleanor says ""I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day. Have fun, nerds,"" the woman behind them makes a confused face, as if she overhears and is like ""huh, someone like this is in the good place?""
9. ""You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is."" -Tahani

I think he was placed in the wrong dimension (the bad place) upon the creation of the universe, much like how Eleanor was bad but ended up in the good place (although we know in the end it's not the good place from the start). Or perhaps everyone from the bad place and good place are the same spieces, but the good place beings are different because they hang out with humans, whereas the bad place beings don't, allowing them to be unable to feel empathy.

I think that everything is exactly as it seems.  I think that Michael is a demon, not an angel, but also that he's not going to turn on them.  I think that Chidi, Tahani, and Jason are not secretly demons who are testing Eleanor.  At this point in the story, I think that everyone is exactly who and where they appear to be.

And here's why.  Mike Schur, and the other writers on TGP, are amazing writers, I think we can all agree.  And amazing writers know that you can really only drop a huge twist on your audience once before you lose their trust and they stop just watching and enjoying the show, and start spending the whole time trying to figure out how you're fucking with them.  Nothing Mike Schur has created in the past has led me to believe he's the kind of writer who just enjoys messing with his audience's heads.  He enjoys telling a story that has us all feeling good at the end.  

Michael's not going to turn on Eleanor, Tahani, Jason, and Chidi because he's already done that once, and it would be crummy writing if he did it again.  Human characters aren't going to turn out to be secretly demons, because they've already done that once, and... again, crummy writing to repeat it.  

I truly believe that we don't have any other giant twists coming our way because I believe that the writers of this show are too good at what they do to need another one.  ",37,236,False,self,,,,,

Just finished rewatching the series, and I thought it would be an interesting idea to keep Shawn involved. As we know, at the end of season 2 Michael locked Shawn in an unmarked room, with a never ending supply of the New Yorker. Now that Michael is behaving more ethically, I can see him feeling bad with how he left things with his old boss, but he can't simply let Shawn go either. I think it would be interesting if Michael gave Shawn recordings (or reports) of all the reboots for him to observe. Being who/what he is, Shawn can probably absorb the info from the 800+ reboots relatively fast. Shawn decides what Michael decided, that the system is fundamentally flawed, and helps to become part of the fix for the system.

This could be followed by Team Cockroach having to help rebuild The Bad Place, and deciding where people go on a case by case basis (Tons of Ethical dilemma's for Chidi). All this will of course happen after their new test, though Michael could give Shawn those reports during the test, while everyone is on earth (giving him time to process them).

This was really just a thought experiment. I am trying to work out where the show is going, because no matter what the results are of this new test, I don't see the team ending up in the Good Place (since that is the final goal that will probably be accomplished in the final season, unless the Good Place is fundamentally broken). This will have them working with their former tormentors, and a pretty rocky foundation (the demons will not be happy about any of this). 

A major problem with this that I will admit to is that Michael cannot just walk around the bad place anymore, so reaching Shawn would be difficult (though maybe not for Janet). In anycase, I thought this would be fun. What do you guys think?",4,15,False,self,,,,,
