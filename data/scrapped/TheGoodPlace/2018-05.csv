They're going to change the world. 

We all know how much the show loves foreshadowing things and tying them up later on, and I can see Eleanor becoming Chidi's pupil ""IRL"" this time around and, while she learns a shirt-ton about ethics 'cause she studied, she'll eventually have and epiphany much like Mindy St. Claire, and he'll help her become what she once pretended to be: an environmental activist who did extraordinary work to raise awareness (not just because she loves mushrooms). 

And one of the main reasons they'll be able to actually change the world is because a certain British philanthropist with legs for days will help raising funds for their missions, getting Tahani into the mix and allowing her to dedicate her life to a worthy cause with the right motivation by ditching her need to overshadow Kamilah (hopefully without losing her knack for name-dropping because that's just too funny). 

I'm unclear how Jason might end up involved in their antics, but I can see him in an inspirational role helping the Team on the ground to fulfill their goals and bring more people to the cause, since he does have an almost preternatural way of solving problems, even if right now his solutions mostly involve Molotov cocktails *(BOOORTLEEEESSSSS!).*

And then, after they've changed the world and proved that bad people can become good if they get a little push in the right direction, they gain admittance into the Good Place and their real challenge as a Team begins: changing the Afterlife. 

I can see season 3 being split in half with these two main storytelling pods, and then an announcement that this was the final season all along, because I really don't think they'd want to extend the show forever and would rather go out on a high note with a proper ending. 

This might end up as just baseless speculation but, Mikeyyy, if you're reading this and I got anything right, hire me, bud!

But it's not likely that all four of them died on the same day, is it?

Option One: If all four 'died' on the same day, then it means they all have a life changing near death experience, literally at the same time, which motivated them to make changes. That alone is enough to get them all in a room.

Example:

***

""Hello, I'm Tahani. My Friend Nicole and my other friend Hugh tell me Australia is a nice place to live. I just need to know... What do you think of my sister Kamilah?""

""I don't know who that is, you sexy giraffe.""

""I've found a homeland at last! So, what shall we do today? Ethics lessons? My friend Madonna tells me that my dear Fraternity Sister Miley is trying to get into a class like this...""

***

Option Two: If they all died at different times, then Eleanor has lived one year longer than she was meant to, but she might be the first one. She's found Chidi now. if she sticks with him like she should, then it means she's there:

***

""Hey! Dork! When your friend tells you that you're not his Best Man anymore, and then invites you for a round of drinks, the correct answer is: Wherever's closest, and then you order the most expensive thing on the menu, since he's buyi-LOOK OUT!""

""Ohh, that was close. I feel like I should have a stomach-ache.""

""That old guy just saved your life... And he looks familiar!""

***

I can see this being a major plot point. Because either Eleanor is going to fall back into her role as unofficial leader of Team Cockroach, and save all their lives; or she's going to be the first one to realize there's something unusual going on. ",13,42,False,spoiler,,,,,

An Existential Reading and Analysis of NBCs The Good Place

By: u/freakingbullshirt


NBCs The Good Place is a television show about where we go when we die. While Friedrich Nietzsche would probably laugh at the idea and say that heaven is a condition of the heart, not somewhere you go after death, he would also probably say, Whats a television show? 

By following four characters journey through the afterlife, The Good Place becomes an existentialists guide to navigating modern society and life in general by showing us how we shouldnt live our lives. Before we dive into the philosophy of the show, lets recap what happened in season one. 

The Good Place opens on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) waking up and being told by Michael (Ted Danson) that she has died and is now in the Good Place. The Good Place is not the Christian heaven or hell, it is instead one of many distinct Good Place neighborhoods where only the best humans live when they die. Michael, the architect of the neighborhood, tells Eleanor that she is in the Good Place because of her exemplary life on Earth. Theres just one problem: Eleanor isnt supposed to be there. Eleanor was not a human rights lawyer that spent her free time feeding hungry children as Michael said she was. Instead Eleanor worked at a call center in Arizona and scammed old people into buying medication they didnt need. Season one of The Good Place follows Eleanor as her soulmate Chidi (everyone is assigned a soulmate upon entering the Good Place; Eleanors soulmate just happens to be a professor of ethics from Senegal) teaches her how to be a better person so she can learn to live in the Good Place. Chidi secretly teaches the basics of moral philosophy to Eleanor and Jason (an amateur DJ from Jacksonville, Florida who was also mistakenly taken to the Good Place) until they are caught by Tahani, Jasons soulmate. Everything comes to a head in the final episode of the season when agents from the Bad Place come to collect two people in order to compensate for mistakenly sending Eleanor and Jason to the Good Place. As all of our main characters are fighting about who deserves eternal damnation, Eleanor has an epiphany. She turns to Michael and says, As we were all fighting and yelling at each other about who deserves to go to the Bad Place, I thought to myself Man, this is torture. And then it hit me. Theyre never going to call a train to take us to the Bad Place. They cant, because were already here. This is the Bad Place. 

Its hard to understate the impact of Eleanors realization. The entire show is flipped on its head in the last few minutes of the season when Michael reveals that he is, in fact, a demon who designed the Good Place just to torture Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani. Not only does this turn of events raise thousands of questions about the plot of the show, it also firmly cements The Good Place as a true existential work, but well get to that.
Before we can discuss what the philosophy espoused by The Good Place can teach us, we must first establish that it the show operates under existential theory, not utilitarianism or contractualism as some on the internet have theorized. In episode one, during Eleanors orientation into the Good Place, Michael shows her a video that explains how people are sorted between the Good Place and the Bad Place. In this video, Michael states that During your time on Earth, every one of your actions carried with it a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe. When your time on Earth ends, we calculate the total value of your life only people with the very highest scores come here, to the Good Place! With this points system, The Good Place seems to posit a belief in moral objectivism. Furthermore, if every action here on Earth carries with it a positive or negative point value, doesnt that fly in the face of existence preceding essence? However, the key to understanding The Good Place as an existential work is to realize that this points system is not what actually determines whether a person belongs in the Good Place or the Bad Place.

Chidi dedicated his life to moral philosophy and to living ethically and is shown to have 1,948,668 points. Tahani raised billions of dollars for countless charities and accrued 997,485 points throughout her life. However consider for a moment that we know all of our four characters are all actually in the Bad Place, despite how many points they have. This puts to bed any possibility that the show might operate under contractualism or utilitarianism, as both operate under the assumption that objective moral truth not only exists but that it would be the basis on which you would judge whether someone is good or bad.

So if total points dont determine whether a person is good or bad- what does? Although The Good Place answers this question differently for each character, it seems that each character is sent to the Bad Place for violating a concept that existentialist philosophers warned us about. Lets begin with Jason.

**Jason Mendoza** spent his life as an amateur DJ in Jacksonville, Florida. Making ends meet by selling fake drugs to college kids, Jason died by suffocation when he hid inside a safe during a botched robbery of a Mexican restaurant. While he might not have spent his life helping orphans or working for the greater good, why does he deserve to be in the bad place? Jasons only goal in life was to become a successful DJ. In his own words, I dont want to be a DJ in Jacksonville forever. I want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee, Tampa even. I want it all. When he was finally given the opportunity to take over for the popular DJ AcidCat, the crowd ended up booing him off stage. Jean-Paul Sartre would agree that Jason belongs in the Bad Place because Jason lived as a Being-for-Others. Sartre cautioned that in many relationships, people can fall in love not with each other, but with the feeling they get when the other person looks at them. In doing so, the lovers become trapped as the for-itself is replaced with the other persons thoughts and actions. Neither persons purpose is to exist as an individual. Jasons obsession with becoming a DJ is no different. His for-itself had been replaced by the success of his career. His career abruptly ended when he was booed off stage at the AcidCat show. Instead of moving on with his life, Jason was left with no sense of self and spiraled out of control, he ended up torching AcidCats speedboat and eventually died while trying to rob a Mexican restaurant a day later. If The Good Places moral philosophy is determined by existential theory as I have stated, Sartre says Jason belongs in the Bad Place. Sartre also says that Tahani belongs down there too. 

**Tahani Al-Jamil** is a was raised in English high society. She studied at Oxford and attended the Sorbonne in France. Although she lived a very rewarding and successful life, Tahani constantly lived in the shadow of her older sister Kamilah. Kamilah was a Nobel prize winner and a Grammy-winning artist. Tahanis biggest accomplishment in life was raising 60 billion dollars for charities and nonprofits, but it still wasnt enough to make her parents proud. Unlike Jason, Tahani spent her life doing good for other people, so why does she belong in the Bad Place? Tahani lived her life in bad-faith. In many ways, Tahani is not unlike Sartres waiter. Sartre cautioned us not to become like this waiter- a man who moved too quickly and was too eager to please customers. The waiter was so committed to his job that he forgot that he was a person with free will first and a waiter second. By committing his life to his job, he was living a lie. Similarly, Tahani was living a lie by dedicating her life to helping others just to impress her parents. Tahani never developed any beliefs or morals of her own. She never worked for anything other than fame or recognition. She forgot that she was a free person who could have left her parents and sister behind and lived her own life. Additionally, Tahani committed another mortal sin according to Sartre. Tahani constantly dwells on the past by bringing up all the good deeds she performed on Earth. In one conversation while picking up trash Tahani says, You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana. Doesnt really matter what shes a princess of. Its not really important.  Tahanis casual name-dropping doesnt stop there, as she routinely says things like, I havent been this upset since my good friend Taylor was rudely upstaged by my other friend Kanye, who was defending my best friend, Beyonc. Tahani, more than any other character, is obsessed with past achievements which Sartre warned would lead to replacing the current self with a past self, thus living a life in bad-faith. 

At first glance, it might seem that the existentialists wouldnt have a problem with **Eleanor.** She lived a classically immoral life, scamming old people for a living, going to a coffee shop where the owner harasses people, and insisting on using the 10 items or less line when checking out with a full cart at the grocery store. But even though most of her actions on Earth made everyone else around her worse off, Eleanor lived authentically and for herself. She wasnt governed by an external moral code or by a strict dedication to a specific role. So does she belong in the real Good Place? Simone de Beauvoir says no. Eleanor is sent to the Bad Place because she is a textbook narcissist. Narcissism, as defined by de Beauvoir, is a well-defined process of alienation: the self is posited as an absolute end and the subject escapes itself in it. Whereas Tahani and Jason lived in bad-faith because they never developed belief systems of their own or stepped out of their roles in society to understand their freedom, it seems Eleanor swung too far the other way. As de Beauvoir would say She is busy, but does not do anything [...] not being able to accomplish herself in any projects and aims. Here de Beauvoir is speaking about housewives, but this applies to Eleanor too. Eleanor is completely absorbed in herself to the point of never dedicating her life to anything but her own pleasure. She quits an amazing job making lots of money just because she was expected to be friendly with her coworkers. Eleanor is so crippled by her wretched parents and terrible childhood that she never forms any type of identity or personal philosophy outside of herself. Instead of doing things because she thought she was right or basing decisions on a personal moral code, all of Eleanor's actions on Earth were her trying to prove others wrong. She didn't refuse to stop going to the coffee shop owned by a man who was filmed groping a woman during a job interview on principle, she kept going to Andy's Coffee because her boyfriend told her she shouldn't. 

Finally, we have **Chidi Anagonye.** On Earth Chidi was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, so one would think that he would be looked upon with the most grace by our existential philosophers. However, according to existential theory, Chidi is the most screwed out of the four main characters. Chidi is sent to the bad place because he is essentially just existential anxiety personified. Soren Kierkegaard defined anxiety as unfocused fear and likened it to the feeling a man gets when standing on the edge of a cliff. Looking down into the abyss below, the man is very scared of falling but he also feels an illogical urge to throw himself off the cliff. This is what Kierkegaard called the dizziness of freedom. This anxiety is described by Kierkegaard and many other existentialists as essential to recognizing ones freedom of choice. However, Chidi should have heeded Kierkegaards advice when he said, ""become honest with yourself so that you do not deceive yourself with imagined power, with which you experience imagined victory in imagined struggle."" His entire life Chidi was paralyzed by the fear of making wrong choices. In primary school, Chidi kept everyone from playing soccer at recess because while picking teams he weighed the pros and cons of picking every kid in class for so long that recess ended before they could start a game. Later in life, he continued to make people miserable with his indecisiveness. Chidi ruined his relationship with his girlfriend when he was consumed by the guilt of lying to a coworker about liking a pair of boots. He once claimed that he missed his mothers back surgery because I promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him program his phone on the day of her surgery! Eventually, his inability to make even the simplest of choices led to his death. Chidi died standing on the sidewalk when an air conditioning unit fell on him. He had been standing under it for 30 minutes just trying to pick a restaurant to go to. Chidi lived his entire life studying moral philosophy and yet never developed his own personal identity. Kierkegaard acknowledges that it is easy to get bogged down in the moral,  ethical or practical implications of any choice. Specifically, he uses the example of getting married. According to Kierkegaard you can either get married or you can choose not to get married, but both choices will lead to your unhappiness in some way or another. If you choose to get married you may fall out of love with your partner or the passion may die. But if you choose not to get married, youll be haunted by the fact that you never married the person you love. Because all choices will lead to our eventual unhappiness, the only correct choice is the one made in good faith. When we consider our own values and make a choice based on those values, we free ourselves from anxiety because we know the choices we made were our own. Chidis mortal sin was never identifying his own beliefs and making a choice for himself. 

The Good Place has offered us four distinct examples of how we shouldnt live our lives, but unlike our four main characters, were not dead yet. So what does it say about how we should live? 
As I see it, using an existential point of view, The Good Place urges us to examine our pasts with a keen eye. If our main characters had taken the existential philosophers advice and questioned their preconceived notions about why things matter to them, they might have ended up in the actual Good Place. Just as we can learn from the writings of Sartre, de Beauvoir and Kierkegaard, we can learn from The Good Place too. We should learn from Jason to not let external forces dictate the choices we make. From Tahani, we should learn to challenge the roles we have accepted for ourselves and not let our past accomplishments become our identity. Eleanor teaches us to live for ourselves, but to not let our obsession with simple pleasures get in the way of actual self improvement. Lastly, Chidi teaches us to embrace the uncertainty of life. After all, we only get a short amount of time on Earth. We can either spend that time worrying about how to live it best, or we can just live.

* Mindy is completely alone (well for about 30 years until the others show up), and that would be enough to drive anyone crazy. **Verdict: Bad.** 

* Her jukebox only plays live versions of The Eagles and William Shatner poetry, so basically it would never get used. **Verdict: Bad.** 

* She has her favourite beer but it's always warm. **Verdict: Medium.** (A good beer would probably be ok regardless of temperature.) 

* She has access to water-stained Anne Rich vampire novels. **Verdict:** I've never read an Anne Rice novel so I'm hesitant to judge here, but reading the same books for 30 years sounds pretty **Bad.** 

* Much like the books, the only movies she has are Cannonball 2 and the making of the same film (although she does record a new video when she meets the others). **Verdict: Bad.**

* Mindy also clearly has a pretty extreme cocaine addiction, evidenced by the fact she was still desperate for some 30 years after last having any. Living like that could not be fun. **Verdict: Bad.**

The warm beer, to me, is the only true medium thing she gets to experience. She's an isolated, cocaine addict that uses masturbation as her main and only form of entertainment and this is meant to be a middling existence. Her life sounds just a few notches above The Bad Place rather than a middle ground (if we're to believe Michael's fake Good Place is similar to the real Good Place).

A few potential, more ""medium"" solutions to the above listed **bad** verdicts could be:

* Instead of being alone, she receives weekly visits from friends that she was only kind of close to, or friends of friends.

* Her jukebox only works for two hours a day and has random 50/50 chance of playing The Eagles and Shatner or her favourite songs.

* She has access to only 10 books. 5 that she loves and 5 that she hates, but she never knows what she's reading until she reads the first page and has to commit to reading the whole thing.

* Maybe something similar with the movies. I was thinking low-quality versions of her favourite movies but she was from the 80s so she might not as anal about quality as people these days are. Perhaps even access to her favourite films but the lead roles are always played by different actors, e.g. one day you're watching Mean Girls starring Lindsey Lohan, the next day it's Forest Whittaker.

* I'm not sure how I'd tackle cocaine one as I'm not too familiar with the realities of addiction or even taking cocaine.

I've noticed in New Girl and Parks&amp;Rec there's this theme of mismatched couples that work. 

Example: Leslie and Chris versus Ann and Ben. There's an episode before Ann &amp; Chris leave where Ann and Ben are discussing how they're chosen such out-of-the-box people to love. It's similar to New Girl where Nick and Cece are the more relaxed, go with the flow type people for most of the show, whereas Jess and Schmidt are more plan/ career oriented. 

I also think this idea applies to The Good Place, where Eleanor, in the beginning, really aligned more with Jason in terms of being this laid back/ lost person in life. Compared to Chidi, who was equally hopeless, but in a much more structured, academic, career way.

This doesn't really add much to the show, I just wanted to see what others thought about this trend. It's not just opposites attract, but also that there are usually multiple characters with each personality type who becomes a friend-type role.",14,14,False,self,,,,,

I just finished binging the show, which I absolutely loved. Jason, Michael, Trevor (who I definitely hope will return sometime), Janet, Mindy and Vicky especially are treasures. I accidentally spoiled the first season for myself, but it didn't spoil anything; it made the show so much more interesting.


The only thing that bothers me a tiny bit and on which I'd like thoughts is the treatment of the main characters, especially Eleanor. I love her and she's funny, but she was easily the worst of all of them and absolutely doesn't deserve to end up in TGP. None of them do, but none of them went out of their way to be terrible like she did, and if it takes a demon bending over backwards to make her meet someone specific, then that's additional proof of her not being deserving of ending up in heaven! She had a terrible upbringing, but so did/do lots of other people and those who didn't manage to become ""good"" didn't get do-overs and favours like she did. I feel bad because I feel like we're supposed to be rooting for her as *the* main character (I also wish the other 3 got more prominence than they currently do haha), but I don't even think she should be in the medium place... Almost everyone has the capacity to change and that's great, but that's not on their capacity that people are judged but by their actions. I'm gonna be quite disappointed if that show doesn't end with a major reform of the system if the 4 mains get in.

That's definitely the only thing that tarnishes slightly my enjoyment of the show, it was perfect until actually getting into TGP became seriously entertained!",7,6,False,self,,,,,

I have been thinking a lot about it and wanted to bounce this idea off of you all:

The Good Place doesn't exist. At least, its not a location in the sense of a ""place,"" but a ""location"" in the sense of a state of being, namely, the state of non-existence. Those who make it to the ""Good Place"" no longer exist, they truly die.

Why do I think this? For one, our knowledge of who goes to the good place, what the good place is, etc is completely flipped on its head at the end of S1. Michael explained how its a neighborhood of 322 residents every time, with a certain number of points (the exact cutoff is left vague to my knowledge). But we find out that this neighborhood was simply a construct designed to torture those four humans. We don't know that it truly represents the real good place at all, because I don't believe even Michael knows it.

Now the fact that Michael claims to be an all-knowing being is what led me down this road; he eventually admits that he doesn't know how to get to the good place. All he knows is that there is a judge who can determine it. 

So why do I think this is what the good place would be? Well, we are confronted with various ideas of a peaceful afterlife, i.e. what paradise should be. Even our own fanbase (and Kristen Bell herself) are split between thinking a true good place would be blissful and peaceful, while others think it should be a place where one is constantly being challenged and growing as a person. But something in the finale got me thinking. When Shawn condemns Michael to his punishment, is it retirement (basically their version of death)? No, its an eternal life, but one spent in a locked room in perpetuity. At that moment I thought how much more preferable it would be to end existence and awareness than have to spend literally eternity in there. And from there I thought how it would be better to end (at some point!) than be aware for literal eternity in any state, in any condition. I think that is the true good place.",37,99,False,spoiler,,,,,

At the end of episode 9, Michael says that getting to the portal in the middle of the Bad Place would be pointless because it would surely end in failure, but decided to do it anyways because it was a human thing to do. But in the next episode, it seems like it would be really easy to get there? If the crew hadnt accidentally walked into the museum commemorating them, they probably would have never been discovered and could walk right through, and if Shawn hadnt raided Mindys the illegal way then there would have been no problems with just casually strolling to the portal. Even with the humans and Michael all having been discovered, all Jake Jortles had to was throw a Molotov cocktail and we cut to the portal with plenty of time to spare to hop in and for Michael to give an extended speech to Eleanor.

If the reality that the show takes place in exists outside of the passage of time in the living world this isnt an issue, but it feels like because they select people out who die at roughly the same time on earth and observe them as dots that there is some basic relation between the two. 

If this is the case and 1 year simulated in the afterlife is equal to 1 year in the living world, shouldnt everyone who the human characters ever knew in life also be dead and in any/either/all of the afterlife realities theyve found themselves in?

Its something I hoped Eleanor or Chidi to have challenged and I would have especially expected this thought to occur to Tahani when she was failing her judges test with her parents. Even if she knew those parents were fake and part of the test, it was her first time seeing them again and would have provoked that logical question to follow.

I decided to look up the lyrics to that song...


I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
**I realise that nothing's as it seems**
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
**This memory of Eden haunts us all**
This desert flower, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall

I think no matter how powerful Gen the judge is, its probably not within their ability/legality to bring people actually back to life. 

This seems like a totally new simulation to see what would happen. I see this timeline going on for several episodes, but then perhaps some of the other demons finding out and maybe trying to mess with them?  Then another kind of reset... Im interested to see where all this goes, but hope they dont get stuck in more and more ridiculous situations where they have to pay it off like what happened in so many shows before like lost.
