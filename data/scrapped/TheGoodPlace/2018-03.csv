Hahahahaha no. Absolutely No. Not at all. But is there another angle to the simulation question?

What if all of Earth was always a simulation - there was never a ""real"" Earth to begin with? When the Judge makes her speech at the start of 2.13, she mentions that ""you're supposed to do good things, because you're good, not because you're seeking moral dessert."" But what if Earth was the method that this entire system evaluates if someone's soul is truly good or not?

It's a bit of a stretch, but I think the theory has its merits. It explains why the Judge was able to send them back so easily, and how Michael is able to enter. It fits with the entire point system idea of the Good Place, as well as the entire ticker system that Michael and Janet sit at. And if it's true, then we have some predictive power for Season 3. Maybe Eleanor and Chidi are going to start a new revolution on Earth, the ultimate simulation? ",13,15,False,self,,,,,

I'm aware that Season 1 let us know about those two twists: [Spoiler!](/s ""Good Place is the Bad Place and only Eleanor,Chidi, Tahami, Jason are real"") but the show whether through free will of it's characters, pure luck or pure intention has always broken it's rules. At first glance inhabitants can literarly do whatever they want( access past memories, fly at will, eat tasty frozen yoghurt, watch pornography etc) but everyone was dependant on  whims of Michael and our protagonists. I'll explain this shortly.

 The final episode explains :[Spoiler!] (/s "" The Bad Place was built as a fake Good Place with sole purpose as a torture room for four people. And to please Mike's 'boss'."").  Because of Michael's utter incompetence a side of me  could buy into his words. We have seen him crumble at first signs of trouble. Mike cannot stand failure as it would leave to his death whether imagined or real. Even with just one tiny mistake everything crumbles. 

Now back to our main characters. Upon arrival Eleanor, a misplaced person immediatly begins changing everyone around her. As  she changes so does the pre-established system. [Spoiler!](/s ""Sinkholes, yellow pajamas, garbage storms and a trip to the Middle Place"") .These things have never happened  before . Before the twist even Mike seemed transformed as he gained actual friends, people that challenge him on a regular basis. You could never know if he is an enemy or a friend. 

The reason for me believing that there's no true  Good/Bad/Middle Place is that Elle's break of the system will gradually create a new universe with new laws with an unfortunate consequence that  the creative powers will be in Elle's hands instead of Mike's. Mike planned that his subjects will torture themselves for thousands of years without thinking his victims would eventually bond. Elle broke his plans. I predict that Season 3's or Season 4' main conflict will be the struggle of control between our team , Eleanor and Mike. I sort of see the new realm a mixture of Good/Bad/Middle places.",6,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

Kamila's sculpture was only impressive because working with metal is likely not that easy to master, especially for a child. However, since K was supposed to be such a whiz at everything, it probably wasn't that hard for her to learn.

Ok. For those who HAVE read the book:

I'd be excited to discuss the way both stories set up Team Good, Team Bad, and Team Human, and how the philosophies of the book and the show compare/contrast when it comes to the generation of ""points""/karma.

For example, Crowley's insistence that generating low-grade evil (traffic jams, being put on unending hold by customer service, etc.) is a more effective way of spreading negative points, because frustrated or low patience/empathy humans with their day ruined are more likely to ruin other peoples' day, causing a chain reaction of shirty interpersonal behavior. We see this kind of a lot in the show, where someone's (usually Elanor) actions will create a chain effect of negativity.

Where the show is more interested in exploring ethics outside of a religious framework, I found it interesting how much the two have in common thematically, and would love to hear any insights fans of both may have had.

2. Does Chidi *really* deserve to be in the Bad Place? Because he was super indecisive, despite having a rigid moral compass that always points to doing the right thing and genuinely looking out for the interests of others? But he couldn't bring himself to tell his friend he bought ugly boots so he's thrown in hell?

I just found it interesting because I distinctly remember reading a post last year on here by a user who was really upset at the twist and Michael's transformation (which I personally loved and thought fit perfectly) and they were ranting and raving about it.

Getting a moral dessert for the good or bad things you've done on earth? Because you do- either eternal bliss or torture judging by what you've done. 

If you are being tested based on how much good you put into the universe (the ENTIRE universe), does your personal motives really matter that much?
Is raising 60 billion for charity, thereby improving the lives of millions, really worth so much less than just being aware that you could get something in return?

This being said:

Moral desert, and the presentation of good deeds, feels very flat right now. It's got a very cartoony approach to good and bad, displaying the Bad as loud, obnoxious parodies who read bad magazines and listen to bad music and trip up the elderly with little more than a passing glance. The good, meanwhile, work tirelessly to make the world a better place, spending little to no time on themselves, endlessly doing the best they can even when it harms them. Wanting anything more is (seemingly!) considered moral desert, and not what's considered right for getting into The Good Place.

This then creates a dilemma. Consider the Perfect Person. The Perfect Person is the basis of what everyone should be - allowing for differences in appearance, opinion, likes and dislikes, etc. So whatever the Perfect Person does, everyone reacts like a mirror and follows suit. The problem then lies in the Perfect Person constantly giving, never receiving, never allowing themselves to receive. Everyone is constantly giving each other stuff even past their own limits and refusing anything that could be considered a reward, meaning that nobody appreciates what's given, everybody slowly becomes miserable, and all that good is for basically nothing.
Obviously, if the everyone endlessly took, and did nothing for anyone else, this too would result in a miserable population of misanthropes, but the Perfect Person who gives and never receives can only work when there is a group of Miserable Misanthropes to take. Which means, in this environment, you're just fostering those Bad people, and the Good can only be Good if there's someone to be better than. But in whatever way, the Perfect Person cannot be happy, and frankly, that's bullshirt.

I recognise moral desert is more about the Heaven's Reward Fallacy, as well as about expecting to be praised and treated like royalty for giving anything at all. But even just mentioning the Heaven's Reward Fallacy - it's something that comes up a lot in therapy, on lists about cognitive distortions. As much as we're shown that the system is messed up, and needs a rehaul, and as much as we know that, the show hasn't gone into detail yet. Michael, demon as he is raised, new in all the millennia he has lived to the concept of being good himself, just about realising the bum deal you get being born into humanity, goes on about moral desert, telling Eleanor about it at the bar, guiding her to find Chidi because he recognises they're stronger together. The thing is, it's not that what Eleanor needs is Chidi: what Eleanor needs is a support system.

They all desperately need support systems. Everyone does, but them moreso than anyone else. Their shortcomings are often part of the fact that nobody around them has been helpful enough, supportive enough, for them to *recognise* their shortcomings.
- Chidi's looked into morality to assuage his fears, make it easier for him to choose things because there has to be a correct option, but never seemed to recognise the source of his indecisiveness, and how that was causing him distress. Everyone chides him for it, but never tries to address it. His girlfriend told him this is why everyone hated him. His best friend got irritable with him right before his death about how hard it was for him to be friends with him. They blamed him, personally, when he was trying his best to be the best him he could be.
- Eleanor's family situation was hell, and taught her to fend for herself from a very early age. People around her taught her that life isn't kind, nobody will care for you, and it's every man for himself, and if you're not tough, you won't get anywhere. She has breakdowns over family toothbrushes, she has no friends to speak of except for people who definitely don't care about her as much as they need to, she lived on her own at 14 years old. Not exactly a great support system.
- Jason had little to no education and neither did his friends, so for as much as he has friends to speak of, none of them are exactly qualified to help him get his life on track. His education also consisted of being given porn to hand out and teachers having sex with their students. He doesn't really know how to take care of himself, doesn't have any emotional maturity, and nobody around him seems to be qualified/able to take care of him.
- Tahani, whilst rich, relatively popular, and active, is still overshadowed by her sister and underappreciated by her parents. She is little more than a prop to her family, who constantly ignore her and abuse her. She desperately strives for their attention, anyone's attention, but her sister is the most popular, beloved and prolific person in what appears to be the world. How do you escape that, when everyone knows your sister's name?

They don't sound, in my opinion, like what they're truly looking for is moral desert. They sound more like they're looking for happiness. But when you're told 'looking for some kind of reward is bad! just do good things! you're not being good enough!' when you're unhappy and looking for happiness, that feels like someone spitting in your face. What they're looking for is probably a support system, good friends, actual happiness, and *therapy*. As far as I'm concerned, they're all suffering with mental health issues of some kind. Chidi, anxiety and OCD. Eleanor and Tahani are both dealing with trauma and probably depression, at the very least. Jason, a learning disability? Arrested development? I can only be mostly certain of Chidi because I can see my own struggles in him.

Moral desert tells you to sacrifice the concept of reward when doing good deeds. Mental illnesses like to tell you that happiness is included in the definition of reward. Especially if you don't have access to therapy or don't know you have a mental illness. I think the concept of moral desert in the show needs an overhaul. I think they need to realise that what they want isn't a crown and to be adored, it's friends and to be respected as human. The dichotomy of Good and Bad thus far feels like it's represented as 'you deserve suffering, be good or else we'll add to it for daring to want more' and I just kind of hope that someone turns around and goes ""wait a second!"" and turns the whole thing on its head. I hope they learn they can have happiness, and do things for themselves, and enjoy themselves, and that good deeds don't need to take away from that. I hope they learn that being good and being happy can coexist, I guess?

They could have chosen Michael in the first place to be an architect because they knew he had a chance to be good and it was some kind of test. He had been passed over for thousands of years because they knew he wasn't bad enough to torture people for real. Maybe the Good Place and the Bad Place decided they would try a new project together to redeem people. It comes around where instead of Michael running a big con in season 1, his bosses were running a con on him. Maybe this has been the medium place all along as Eleanor's instincts told her she should be in.

One big clue is that they made a point to show how easy it was for Michael to steal Good Janet, he just walked in. It's almost like they let him do it. Shawn never finding out about all the reboots is suspicious as well. Not noticing they're underneath the train and Bad Janet scanning everything but there. Then there's them sneaking into the bad place. Their disguises were not convincing at all if the humans were famous wanted fugitives and none were good at acting at anyone but themselves, Jason is too dumb to do it, Chidi can't lie, Good Janet's attempt to be Bad Janet was easily transparent. They manage to run to the portal without anyone catching them, Michael escapes from Shawn, etc. It could all be on purpose by Shawn to let Michael go forward with his plan and trying to redeem the big four.",6,50,False,self,,,,,

One: He was in the Bad Place, disguising himself as a demon and working his way up to Architect, for so long he forgot what it was like to be good, and that's why he joined Team Cockroach.

Two: He only wanted everyone to think my first option was the truth, and the popular theory here that this whole thing was his master plan to try to fix the broken system for who goes where in the afterlife, and Team Cockroach were his guinea pigs (as well as his ticket back into the Good Place).",5,24,False,spoiler,,,,,

Is it the age they die (which in the four protagonists case all is conveniently around 30)?  If so is most of the good/bad place filled with the elderly? It seems like it would have been a natural question to wonder why everyone in the good place was young (but not uniformly young: some of the couples seemed like they were around 50).  

Also when you die do you go into some holding pattern for a long time? Because Michael had to have a long time to plan his good place scheme with these four people, all perfectly suited for this torture scheme and all having conveniently died young in a freak accident around the same time.

SHE OPENS THE FORKING GOOD PLACE PORTAL!
Not only that but she also opens that portal at the end of the episode before Michael barges in.

We know this isn't an error because Michael enters from the Bad Place portal, which they aren't standing in front of. Also during Eleanor's test Gen gestures to The Good Place portal.
