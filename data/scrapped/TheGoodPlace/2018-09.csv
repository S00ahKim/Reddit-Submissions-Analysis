In fact, there's no clearer example than in the episode where they are in disguise in the bad place and have to interact with the demons.  He fits right in.  

I honestly thought his purpose on the show in s1 was to show someone who was even worse than Eleanor. Someone to make her look like she really is redeemable.  But therefore I always viewed him as nonredeemable cause they write him so awful. He isn't a Tommy Fresh, he's not written even as smart as Andy Dwire, he's less aware of his badness because of this. 

As the show progressed I see its trying to make him almost sweet every now and then, but its always undercut it with more badness or stupid comments.  

I personally have never understood how anyone finds any likable qualities to the character, But I see people do enjoy him, and I'm in the minority.  I still enjoy the show, I just have a lot of jason to ignore every episode.   


And I just cannot understand why the writers would write him that way. Also in my opinion, he's so dumb, its borderlining on actual disability. So it's confusing why they made this choice. And having the demon characters acting just like him makes it all the more confusing how he is anywhere near redeemable as the other 4.  It nearly ruins the shows logic to me, every time Eleanor says how all 4 of them should be able to go to the good place.  I don't see it for Jason, and it kinda sucks me out of the show.  I just needed to vent a little lol.

When people die and go to The Good Place, their physical (incoporeal?) form is adjusted to the point in their life where they are mature, healthy, and the most confident about themselves.

This avoids someone in the afterlife needing a walker or a wheelchair due to old age. It also prevents children from spending eternity as a child or an infant who can't take care of themselves or in a hormonal developmental phase which would be unpleasant. 

So everyone you see is between 20-50ish -- wherever they will be most comfortable and happy in their own bodies and mental growth forever.

He does not regret this choice and does not dwell on its consequences, he makes his decision and accepts the repercussions of his actions.

Before saying anything at all I want to make clear that the most cruel aspect of the show is the bad place and the sheer amount of people spending eternity there. For such severe consequences, wishing for a ""medium place"" is justified. I want to argue that the concept of a medium place is trying to dodge moral responsibility, independent of the severity of the bad place or the amount of people there.

&amp;#x200B;

We are all morally responsible for our actions, this is a fact we can either ignore or accept. Ignorance, after all, is fairly famous for today's issues such as CO2 emissions, overfishing, (single-use) plastic, and so on.

Eleanor repeatedly justifies her own actions by saying, she was ""normal"", she is not so much different from the people in The Good Place and that she should go to the ""Medium Place"". This can be common rhetoric especially for all problems concerning the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), i.e. CO2, overfishing, plastic. Everyone consumes fairly similar to one another. To conclude that this frees us from moral responsibility would still be false. Wanting a Medium Place is the perfect representation of this.

But there is no Medium Place in morality. I think this is were the cruel concept of the show holds true. Our actions are good or bad and we cannot avoid moral responsibility for what we do.",5,24,False,self,,,,,

Since we know that the gang are confirmed to be alive back on earth and not in a simulation I was wondering about how they will die again, or if they even will? 

If their deaths come about by a reversal of Micheal saving them, and they are presumably now doing a lot of good on earth, it seems wrong to reverse this. 

If they all die young again, how will this happen? They all die young in the first instance as a result of their own personal shortcomings so what will happen to them this time to cause their death?

If they all live into old age, when they eventually do die will they be made to be 30ish when they return to the afterlife? 

Or will Micheal and Janet find their way to earth and maybe the series will take place there for a while?

Has anyone had any theories? 

Either way Im so exited to see how it turns out!

I think it would have been more interesting to see how a Buddhist Monk ends up in The Bad Place, since apparently humans' actions or even good intentions don't matter on Earth if their motivations aren't pure, or they unintentionally cause harm to others (as in the case of Chidi and Tahani.) Jianyu could have remained silent until the end, with flashbacks of his life as a monk. Maybe he could have figured out that they were really in the Bad Place and didn't speak until the end revealing it. I don't know. It just seems like a waste of a character. Don't get me wrong. The actor is HOT but he was way hotter and more interesting (to me) as this silent, mysterious guy. Jason is...kinda boring, one dimensional. His character doesn't really make sense to me. Is he supposed to be a lovable dummy, but he's a criminal ? Are we supposed to like him? I don't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also thought toward the middle of Season 1 (after Jianyu is revealed as Jason) that Michael did know everything all along, but the characters ""become"" their highest selves in The Good Place. Like, Eleanor's best version of herself is the lawyer/humanitarian. Jason's best version of himself is a monk, Chidi writes his best book and becomes the best teacher he could be, Tahani becomes more humble, less self absorbed...or something like that.

I've had this theory for a while now, but I don't think that Michael is actually a demon. I think that Michael is actually placed in a simulation by the Good Place to see if he's worthy of being one of the Good Place architects.

_______________________

I think that Michael has been in this simulation for millenia (again, it's a simulation so time is irrelevant, especially in the afterlife) and was placed in the ""Bad Place"" with all the with his memories wiped, so he actually belives he is a demon, therefore he has behaved like one. After all, in most religious theology demons are just fallen angels.

I believe that Michael's simulation is a series of tests, the first test (that we know of) is him having his own torture plan to be the architect of. Rather than normal, grotesque, and painful torture, he chose to put his four humans in a neighborhood modeled after the good place, which relatively isn't as terrible as the other forms of torture talked about in the show. Every time he failed at successfully torturing them we perceived as simply that, him failing at torturing them. But in actuality, he was failing because he is not actually a torturer, and with every reboot he became more empathetic towards the humans.

He then passed this first test by joining the humans side and aiding them in their escape from the Bad Place. He passed the next one when he helped them escape the real Bad Place when he sacrificed himself to the hands of Shawn (somebody Michael is supposed to be a servant to), and is now in the next part of his tests by helping the humans live a better and more fulfilling life on earth.

He went from being a demon who only cared about torturing humans, to helping the humans be better people. And not only that, but he is helping them be better people ON EARTH. Seems more like something a guardian angel would do rather than a demon if you ask me.

_______________________

To expand on this theory of mine, I don't think Michael is the only one being tested. I also think that the four humans are going through their own respective tests as well, and that the Good Place is either doing one of three things:

1) The Good Place is doing an experiment of a new way of ""saving people"" (similair to Michael's new way of ""torturing people"") and thought it would be best to do all of theirs together, alongside Michael's test.

2) This is an incident similar to Mindy St. Claire's, and this was the Good Place and the Bad Place's compromise on deciding who gets to keep Michael and the humans.

3) This is what ""purgatory"" is. For humans who did not live an original good life on Earth, this is their second chance and a way for them to redeem themselves.

_______________________

However, this theory raises a few questions which I haven't really put too much thought into answering yet, such as:

- Is Shawn in on it? Is he a part of the simulation/test? Is he running all of this?

- What about Janet? What's her purpose in the simulations, if not just to be a guide for the humans, but also for Michael? Is that why Michael was able to steal her so easily?

- Why is Michael being put through these simulations in the first place? Is he a fallen angel looking for redemption? Is he slipping and this is how the Good Place is testing him? Is he simply just trying to get a promotion to Architect-Angel? (Get it, like Arch Angel, ha ha)",32,52,False,spoiler,,,,,

Janets are supposed to be guide figures for the humans in the Good Place, and they are also used by architects as tools they use to make their lives easier. We know that bad Janets are bad, and they help bad place architects (or torture aficionados) accomplish their goal of torturing. We also know that good Janets are good, and they help good place architects with building a neighborhood that is well suited for the humans.

I believe that Janets also serve as guides to help the architect (or torturer) keep on track to accomplish their goals, and that the Janet and the architect are somewhat of a reflection of eachother, that they take qualities from eachother. So a bad Janet combined with a bad place torturer makes eachother worse, and a good Janet and a good place architect make eachother better.

But what about our case, seeing as we have a Good Place Janet mixed with a Bad Place Architect?

Since Michael stole a good place Janet, I think that being around and working with her has brought some of the actual good place into him, which has made him more empathetic to humans (in our case, to our 4 main humans). I think that because Michael is becoming more empathetic and able to relate more and more to the humans, that he has had the adverse affect of making Janet more human than she was beforehand. Which is evidenced by how Janet's character and qualities have changed to be more human like over the two seasons.

This would mean that the reboot affect that is causing Janet's humanness to evolve rapidly, was also the cause to Michael's empathy to evolve more rapidly with every reboot. Because of all the reboots, they have acted as a catalyst of sort on eachother and their character progession.

Chidi knows he has horrible anxiety, and a lot of people in his life even told him so. But he never decided to actively seek help or therapy for his problems. If his friend hadnt tested him and he was the best man at the wedding, he would have ruined the wedding. The girl he was in bed with was annoyed because he kept bothering her with his qualms. The kids at recess ran out of time to play because Chidi couldnt decide who to pick. Maybe he was so indecisive because he didnt know what was wrong, which many people consider good and ethical. But because of this, he was thinking more about himself than the other people in these situations. 

Of course, Chidi doesnt actually deserve to be in hell for that or anything but I think some people are defending his actions just because he has anxiety.

I know this has been posted before but then I found something else. I remembered there's a similar scene in season 1 so I checked it out to see if they're the same. It turns out ... they're not. In the scene from 1x12, there's a red car instead of Kamilah's truck. Eleanor's position and the buildings in the back were also different.

I believe that this was just a production error, especially since they might have done a reshoot for the scene in 2x13, but I also think that this might hint at something. This show has done foreshadowing and put little hints that became a bigger plot point in the later episodeslike when Eleanor wrote ""FIND CHIDI"" on the front page of ""What We Owe to Each Other"" book and then that book became the title of Chidi's lecture in the season finale that Eleanor watchedso this might be another one. I mean, when shooting/editing the scene in 2x13 they must be looking for the scene in 1x12 for references, right? There must be some reason why they put Kamilah's poster in the background.

Could this be a hint that they might be in a simulation, after all? Maybe a hint at what happens in season 3? Or just an error? What do you think?

1.)  The entirety of the good place/bad place rules system doesn't actually make any sense and that there's another layer to the onion which will likely be revealed mid-S3, which is that Michael's actually being tortured, but driven into salvation. The whole story is actually supposed to be his redemption arc, he's being assigned those four as more of a guardian angel on four borderline people to improve them into the good place. Everything we see is actually the real Medium place/purgatory, and they could languish there forever never improving, actually make progress and move up, or fail miserably and descend to the real Bad Place together. Sean, Vicky, Adam Scott, the judge, etc. are simultaneously torturing Michael and helping guide him to a place of redemption. He's actually too nice/fascinated with things to be pure evil. 
The only problem with this is there's nowhere else to go after S3, which leads to..

2.) Alternatively/additionally, we'll have a season 3 which does again culminate in a judge on Michael (and it's made to look like a redemption arc for him but it won't be driven by Sean, Vicky, the S2 judge, etc.), where he will pass the S3 test early in S4, only for everyone to discover he's the actual Devil, disguised as an architect making a play against the real good place, and his naive persona is another layer of the facade (and maybe only Adam Scott was in on it, hence all the S1 bullying). He'll make the argument that the system is too imbalanced/Hell is too overworked and that he will equalize everything and end the torturing after he's taken down the real Good Place, but it'll be up to the four (plus Janet) to stop him, earning them their place in the Good Place (but they'll reject it, being the first humans to do so, and wind up with Mindy St. Claire).

Each season has culminated in a judge so far, and I think S3 will similarly climax in a judge for Michael, either way. If I'm right about #2, then S4 will likely climax in the four being the judge of Michael/the Devil, and S5 climaxing in the God figure (a Janet?) judging everyone (maybe literally rejudging *everyone*).",1,6,False,self,,,,,

So here's a crazy theory for you...

I've been wondering why Michael is so obsessed with the idea of soulmates. If you think about it, it's a little random and not part of any standard idea of the afterlife. It's not something that the other demons seem particularly bothered about but he brings his scenarios back to that theme constantly.

What if this is some sort of greater test to see if non-humans can also have soulmates and become 'complete' in a way which improves them? One Michael himself isn't actually aware of?

Michael and Eleanor seem more and more like twin souls - they get each other, they can literally never defeat each other as they are the same, and are the only ones who actively enjoy each other's company without any expectations (I love Chidi, and his existence clearly makes Eleanor want to be a 'better person', but you have to admit she's never happier than when she's with Michael, while Chidi is literally the person on earth voted most likely to torment her according to Michael's original plan). Equally, we have Janet a robot-nonhuman-creator-being of some sort and Jason. They are always drawn to each other and fit each others needs somehow perfectly. 

Am I reading too far into this, or is the soulmates theme a clue about some future twists?

That's stated in the show several times.

But aren't humans sort of immortal as well in this universe? Like, being human seems to be a temporary phase, with the afterlife a continued existence of the soul that apparently also lasts forever.

That kind of means Michael is the only one of the group who can properly die, if that's what 'retirement' really is. He may have allegedly lived longest, but all the humans aren't in danger of being splattered across suns and ceasing to exist. In fact, they are now eternal.

The only way around this logical issue I can see is that the ""demons"" have the same soul as humans, but there are cycles at play. So a human might be born, be awful, die, be a demon in the afterlife, eventually screw up and die, reincarnate as a human, and keep going in a constant loop where, despite not remembering their learning, they improve ethically, and eventually that leads to becoming an angel and living happily?

Which means Michael's soul is on the same sort of journey as the humans. And he's not a demon (so racist!) - that doesn't actually exists. In fact, we're all the same, just at different stages of a long journey of learning towards a good place we create ourselves.

We know the best NFL team will always will be the Jacksonville Jaguars.  As a native of Jacksonville and huge Jags fan IRL, the game in London is a big deal. For those who do not follow the NFL, once a year the Jags will play in London. No matter how we are doing that season we will win the game in London too, it is our curse you could say.

 It is definitely something I would love to go to. I feel Jason feels the same about this game too. (And yes, I now say ""Bortles"" whenever I am throwing something). Jason will go to the Jags game somehow, haven't thought about those specifics yet. Chidi and Elenor will go to London, probably to go to a university or some other nerd thing. Tahani will be in London being a true selfless philanthropist,  possibly with Shad Khan (owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars who is a selfless philanthropist as well IRL).

The priest took a basket full of coal, emptied it and gave it to the man saying ""Fill it with water from the lake on the other side of town and come back here."" 


The man objected because it's a basket. It won't hold the water but the priest insisted. 


Going back and forth five times that day the man finally gave up and shoved the empty basket back saying ""See, I told you it won't hold any water! This is useless!!!"" 


The priest smiled and said ""Why do you think I cared about the water?"" And showed him the basket, previously dirty and black. Now washed clean.

Ok, so I believe that right now there's been some riffing from 'The Divine Comedy'. Dante has hell divided into a series circles, with a sort of false heaven in the first circle. 

In order to escape, however, the only way out is via the center of hell, literally climbing on Satan to escape out the other side. The other side happens to be opposite side of the earth from Europe, aka Australia. 

That's how the first book ends. The second book is about purgatory, in Australia, and how people that aren't quite saints, but not damned are striving to be better.

3. Bad Place demons revolt against the higher-ups of the afterlife because, well, they're bad.

5. (Building off of prediction 3) Demons take over the afterlife. Michael and Janet are forced to take refuge on Earth.

6. (Building off of prediction 5) The humans die almost immediately due to a screw up by Michael/Janet.

Michael, for all his good, is still a demon and made his way to Earth pretty easily (multiple times, no less). Trevor has made his way to Earth to (presumably) futz with the plan to keep Team Cockroach (or now The Brainy Bunch) separated and from becoming better people thanks to a backdoor in the system. We've also had direct interaction with an example of 'neutral' in the show from Judge Gen. That covers 'bad' and 'neutral'...

The one aspect of TGP afterlife we have had *almost* no interaction with is a legitimate angel, or true 'Good Place' representative. We witnessed one speaking on a videotape with Trevor when they explained Mindy St Claire's perpetual medium afterlife, but otherwise we haven't had a true representative of 'Good' to interact with at all. Now that we know demons have access to Earth- this raises some questions about the remainder of the season, for sure. For one- do angels have the same ability, do they have any desire to do so, or have they already? Are we going to find that some people we've met with already are actually Good Place or even 'Neutral' representatives sent to meddle with the group's affairs, or are they totally removed from the situation?

So to start off Ben (P&amp;R) is not real, he is a character made up by Trevor (GP) Like Michael now Trever wanted to explore Earth and see what made humans the way they are, he wanted to study earth. So he went to the doorman and possibly bribed him with the frog keychain to get down to earth. 

From there he took the form of Ben and met Leslie, Ron, and the rest of the gang. He learned to love earth, and I realy do think he loved Leslie. But obviously that romance didnt last as Leslie is only mortal, I think that then she went to the good place. A place that (most likely) Trevor cant go, he was saddened by this and came back to the bad place to do what he does best, torture people. Leading us up to the present day.

In fact, if the Good/Bad Places automatically translate languages, Michael may have never been exposed to a human language, because everything the humans say gets translated. Kind of like how Americans don't get exposed to other languages because \*everything\* is translated to English for us.

When Michael goes to Earth, the Doorman specifically says that his powers won't work on Earth. Language translation is a power of the Good/Bad Places, so how can Michael speak English at all, never mind in a flawless Australian accent?

I think that for this season, they're going to double down on the love triangle aspect of the show. We thought they did it last season, but I think they might fully lean into it again.

**Actual Theory** - Everyone (apart from the demons and The Judge) will be in a love triangle.

Here's the best way I can show on Reddit what I think is going to happen:

* Chidi will have to choose between Simone and Elenor

* Elenor will have to choose between Chidi and Tahani

* Tahani will have to choose between Jason and Elenor

* Jason will have to chose between Janet and Tahani

Now, none of this will be the main plot (perhaps one episode dedicated to it around episode 10), it will be used for comedy and moments of levity and sadness throughout the season.

Everything about it was wrong. For fun, here are some of the biggest ones I noticed:

1) *Safety violations everywhere.* A 3T MRI machine (standard for research use) generates a magnetic field that's 60,000x stronger than the Earth's magnetic field. It's strong enough to [rip a chair off the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBx8BwLhqg) or [crush someone's skull with a flying piece of metal](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/31/nyregion/boy-6-dies-of-skull-injury-during-mri.html). Jewelry, backpacks, belts, and hoodies with big metal zippers are all *very* dangerous to have in the scanner. If Ben had a phone or credit cards in that backpack, those would be completely fried. (To make myself feel better, I'm imagining that they're all being trained in a mock scanner... but that seems unlikely.)

2) *That's not what participating in an MRI study looks like.* In most places I know of, it costs in the ballpark of \~$500 to book the MRI for an hour. That time is super precious. While the MRI machine is collecting data, it send out a very loud, repetitive pulse sequence; definitely too loud to have a conversation. People also typically don't talk during scans, because it moves their head a lot and ruins the image. The room was silent while Eleanor and Simone were talking to Chidiwhich means they were collecting no data. This is a minor one; I like to think that Simone is rolling in so much funding that she can just hang out in the scanner.

3) *Neurobullshit everywhere*. The interpretation of MRI data in this episode was all wrong, but I'm just going to point out my pet peeve: MRI images don't literally show the brain ""lighting up"". Most measurements we takelike someone's height, or the temperature of an ovenhave meaningful units (e.g., 100 degrees Celsius means an exact temperature, every time, on every thermometer). MRI measures are not like that; we're collecting an indirect measure of brain activity that has no meaningful units. MRI studies mostly look at *relative differences*for example, if that number is bigger in some part of the brain when you make hard decisions, compared to when you make easy decisions. This measurement is also super noisy, so you usually have to run many many trials of your experiment (e.g., make lots of hard decisions interspersed with lots of easy ones). It sounds like Simone just ran one trial of her experiment on Chidi, which should give her mush. 

Obviously, I love this show, and it's just fiction, etc. etc... Just found it funny. :)",34,135,False,spoiler,,,,,

And then the trolley itself, with Chidi actually having to decide who to save. When in his indecisiveness, he gets splattered with the blood of five people, I lost it. I laughed so hard I felt a pain in my back and side.

Michael knows that he will likely be accused of interfering on Earth beyond what he was permitted to. However, with The Doorman's door being the only way to and from Earth, it will depend on his testimony to actually convict Michael of breaking the rules. So he bought the frog mug for The Doorman as a kind of bribe, so what when the time comes, The Doorman will cover for Michael and hide the truth.

Frog refused at first, but eventually gave in to Toads pleads. Toad immediately started to unsafely juggle the jar with his feet. Obviously the jar broke and death was unleashed. Frog was blamed.

So im watching the good place for the first time, and in S2 E12 Eleanor is watching a video from Chidi about what do we owe eachother, and chidi is talking in english. But i vaguely remember Chidi saying everything is automatically translated in the good place, and that he is actually talking french, so how does that work in the real world? ",0,0,False,self,,,,,

I mean can a person really be defined by the bad mistakes in there life? I feel like the point of there being a good place is that it's nearly impossible to get into. I mean look at it this way what gives a person the right to judge another person?

I'm catching up right and watching the Judge character and I find her very condescending I mean yeah the four of of them are not killers, I mean as far as we know none of them have unintentionally caused or contributed to a death and none of them are rapists or anything. Still it's like Michael said the system is very fundamentally flawed.

I remember on an episode of Lucifer he tells this guy that the gates or cells of hell are unlocked and the people there can leave any time but they don't because their own guilt keeps them there. Even then though the system is potentially flawed because what if the guilt is not well founded or based on a misunderstanding?

It actually reminds me of a episode of Community involving a trampoline where the big take away was that a paradise that excludes people cannot truly be paradise.",3,16,False,self,,,,,
