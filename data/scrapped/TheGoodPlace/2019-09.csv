She will be helpless to deal with it, and her challenge will be getting to a place where she can sacrifice her own happiness (i.e. her love for Chidi and her desire to be with him)  for both Chidi's and Simone's. 

Her character growth comes from learning how to let go of her selfishness and get to a place where she is truly happy for Chidi (and Simone) despite her own desires and wants not being fulfilled, and her ability to put others before herself ultimately leads her to the Good Place. She has to let go.

In *Janet and Michael*, that Janets can't lie. Obviously, the latter turned out to be wrong, but if Janet tries to lie, it causes glitches.

However, we saw Janet tell lies all the way back in Season 1 without it causing glitches:

""Eleanor! Eleanor, please, I have kids. I have three beautiful children. Tyler, Emma, and little tiny baby Phillip.""

Even all the way back then, Janet had the ability to lie. It's not a season-to-season inconsistency, because she told Michael in Season 2 that she was pregnant and it's his baby. But it looks like she's only allowed to lie when her life is in danger. Hell, even telling Eleanor ""If you press \[the reset button\] I will be *destroyed*."" wasn't quite the truth, now was it? And they'd been nowhere near the beach at the time.

So, considering Janet has a protective mechanism that allows her to say whatever's necessary if it keeps her from getting killed, and it seems to work even if no one's near the plunger, and she's been placed in a neighborhood with hundreds of demons (one of which kills her *a lot)*, and she's the only one whose official job it is to protect humans and she can't do that while she's rebooting...

Janet could have gotten away with a lot of lying without it causing glitches. We know that Michael made her ""disseminate false information"" all the time. I think the reason why that didn't cause glitches is because correcting him at the time would have gotten Janet rebooted and put the humans in danger.

Janet might have known all along that she was in the Bad Place, but her privacy settings forbid her to give out information about other residents (even when they are demons), and she figured that it would be safer for everyone concerned if she kept her mouth shut and went along with it.

In the first season, I felt like something was off - definitely didn't see the twist coming, but thought Tahani in particular was a bit annoying to be purely good.  Chidi, though, I thought was the definition of good.  

Ever since I left organized religion in high school, I have had an intense anxiety around my purpose and what guiding force I should use to make decisions.  I do love philosophy and ethics, and some days my anxiety simmers and that interest manifests in scholarly pursuits or conversations (my absolute favorite activity is discussing these topics in any setting).

I loved the twist because I didn't see it coming but I also love the smack in the face that was realizing Chidi had near ruined his life due to indecision.  I can think of countless examples where I applied to too many schools or jobs, broke up with romantic partners because it didn't feel exactly right, and even have struggled academically in medical school because I feel the need to check boxes that make everything perfect and sensical, while life, including medicine, is not that way.  For example, we take the Hippocratic oath to do no harm, but we use medications and do surgeries that have sometimes terrible side effects.  It gives me a literal stomach ache, and I don't even believe in Heaven or Hell.  I just want to do what is right.

Anyway, thanks for being a space for me to reflect.  I'm trying to be better.  I'm even in the middle of three shows right now but I'm trying to commit to TGP because I think it's helping me... ah!",5,28,False,spoiler,,,,,

102,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2019-9-6,2019,9,6,1,d03bxe,self.TheGoodPlace,Theory: TPTB know that they points system is flawed. Everything we've seen on the show is both a system test and a search for a solution.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/d03bxe/theory_tptb_know_that_they_points_system_is/,thesleepingsatellite,1567701977,"I come to you with Yet Another Endgame Theory. This theory is based on two things: 


* These tweets from TGP: https://twitter.com/nbcthegoodplace/status/1166365089714192385
* This article: https://www.cbr.com/good-place-portraits-finale-spoilers/


I looked at the tweets before reading the whole article, and came to a conclusion that I thought the article was heading towards, however it never quite got there.


My theory is that everything we've seen so far is a system test - an evaluation of the current points system.   Something is so  *wrong* with the system that even Doug Forcett can't get in.  Something is so *wrong* that workers in the accounting department are begging for retirement. Contrary to what has been said on the show, The Powers That Be running the afterlife know the system has is flawed, but because they do not understand humans they cannot pinpoint the reason why. To determine the cause of the system failure that has doomed all humans born after 1497 to The Bad Place, they run tests and diagnostics. 


I might have gone a bit overboard in this analysis. Some of the points I bring up are a bit of a stretch, I admit, but it was fun going through episode summaries trying to find points that support my theory. 


TL;DR at the end. 


## Team Cockroach


TPTB chose two test subjects - Eleanor and Michael, who are the only two individuals identified as Team cockroach in the above tweets. They are the cockroaches - the test subjects - for the system test. 


### Eleanor


Eleanor is used as a method to evaluate the ability of humans to live a moral life informed by solid ethical values in the absence of outside factors. She helps to answer the following questions:
* have people become less moral, or is something else wrong with the system?
* can people improve in the after life and become better, more selfless individuals?
* can people move beyond the petty jealousy that can come with romantic relationships?


On some of her tests:
* Eleanor's test by Gen in S02E12 is a evaluation of her selfishness / selflessness.
* Eleanor's test in S03E04, when the group disbands, is an evaluation of her reaction when the first group she ever identified with disbands and deserts her.


Further, she is partnered with one of the entities running the system test: Chidi (more on that in a bit). 


### Michael


Michael is the test subject to examine the impact of stress on daily life, and the ability to form friendships and lasting bonds, both independently and together:
* he has evolved from an amoral demon who enjoyed torturing humans into a person who cares about his friends 
* he has developed a moral compass
* he has experienced the existential horror of the universe
* his caption in the image is ""it's been life-changing"" - and at the end of the series, i think we will find that this is true, but not in a personal sense. The events of the series will have changed life and existence as we know it in this fictional universe.
* Much of Michael's early tests revolve around trying to manage an unmanageable and deeply frustrating situation, with disgruntled employees, threat of retirement/death, and projects that consistently fail. 
* Michael's later tests revolve around self-sacrifice and selflessness vs. selfishness, to see if he can put the group's well-being ahead of his own. 
* Michael's invitation to join Team Cockroach in S02E04 is by design, and part of the larger plan to determine if he can evolve. 
* The gang's time in The Bad Place (S02E11-12) is part of an exercise to determine if Michael is willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. 
* Likewise, Gen's stipulation that he not interfere (and that there will be harsh penalties if he does) is another test to see how far Michael will go to help his friends. 


He is also partnered with one of the entities running the system test: Janet. 


### Looking at them both together


Further arguments when looking at both Eleanor and Michael:
* These two characters are our Most Improved: out of every character in the series, the behaviour, morals and ethics of both of these characters have improved and changed *the most*. 
* They have bonded in a very tight and human way. 
* Eleanor and Michael are the two characters that are working the most directly and actively to solve the problem of Existence and the Afterlife. They were very specifically chosen to identify the reason behind the system failure and come up with a potential solution.


## The Brainy Bunch


Janet and Chidi are *brainy* because they are the brains behind the system test. They architected the system test, and are participating in it for two reasons:
* to closely observe the subjects
* to provide guidance to the subjects during the system test
* because they are not unbiased (they want people to get into the good place) they nudge Michael and Eleanor in the right direction when required.


Each of the brains is paired with a test subject, thought they do not interact exclusively with that one person.


### Chidi


* He evaluates Eleanor's ability to develop a moral compass: Chidi is investigating ethics and morals with Eleanor to determine if humans can improve by living a good life free of outside influences and factors. Eleanor was chosen because she became an Arizona dirtbag due to outside influences that were beyond her control. 
* Chidi stood by Eleanor after she told him she didn't belong in The Good Place indicates that he didn't want her to leave (to go to the bad place) because that isn't part of this test scenario. Her presence in the neighbourhood is required, as is her interaction with him.
* That Chidi is a polite, kind, male Senegalese intellectual is not an accident. I feel that he's designed to be as different from Eleanor as possible, to determine if Eleanor can move past any prejudices and biases she has. 
* The Trash Cleanup vs. Flying - I see this as being one of the first real big tests, a Litmus test of sorts.  If Eleanor failed and didn't clean up (or at least solicit Janet's assistance to do so) then it's possible that the experiment would not have gone forward at this point. 
* Chidi killing Janet in S1 - this is an evaluation of Michael's behavior after his friend is ""killed"", and to examine how Michael reacts when Chidi tells Michael that it was himself, a moral philosophy professor, that killed Janet, and not a more suspicious person like Eleanor.
* In my opinion, Chidi and Eleanor's romance never quite landed, and that plays into this theory. Michael Shur's romantic couples are always fully developed and it is easy to get fully invested in them.  Think Jim/Pam, Leslie/Ben, April/Andy, Jake/Amy - they're couples with a rich backstory and a long build up to them getting together.  In comparison, Chidi/Eleanor has often felt underdeveloped and rushed in this series. I always chalked it up to the fact that TPTB need to repeatedly restart their relationship and awareness of each other from scratch, and the show producers didn't want to retread storylines. But perhaps the relatively shallow nature of their relationship is because the romantic aspect of their relationship is not the point - the point is that their relationship is part of the evaluation to determine how Eleanor deals with romantic competition (Vicki, Tahani, Simone).


### Janet


* Capacity to care: Janet is testing the capability of people to care for others. Her test of Michael to determine if someone who is ostensibly cruel and amoral can transform into a good person who cares about and wants to help people, even if he explicitly understand it is his purpose not to help humans, but to torture them.
* The cacti - a test to see how Michael responds to increasing irrelevancy, inaccuracy and ridiculousness. 
* her relationship with Jason - a test to evaluate how Michael responds to someone her knows having a (possibly) inappropriate relationship.  It may have been a way to test Michael's ability to cope and change.
* Janet's request that Michael terminate her in S02E07 is a test to determine if Michael can commit an act that he finds heinous (easy option?) find another solution to save his friend (difficult option)




## The Soul Squad


The Soul Squad are the evaluators, the *actual* judges. They are not judging Eleanor and Michael, they are judging the system.  They observe the test and will make recommendations when the test is complete. 


### Tahani


* Tahani really *is* nice to Eleanor through out the series. Sure, she's a bit of a condescending bench, but that is part of the system test, to see how Eleanor responds to someone who appears better than her. 
* The love-quadrangle with Tahani, Chidi, Eleanor and Vicki was introduced to examine how Eleanor would behave when presented with romantic competition.
* Tahani's uncanny ability to impersonate demons and bring Rhonda to life points to a flexibility and an ability to adapt and mimic other personalities. This would be a useful skill if she is actually an evaluator, instead of a self-obsessed socialite. 


### Jason


* his reveal to Eleanor in S1 that he didn't belong either was to pair him, the evaluator, with Eleanor, the test subject. 
* Jason and Janet falling in love - their relationship may be construct designed to test Michael's ability to cope and change. Alternatively, it may not part of the plan - they could just be taking advantage of the situation and their humanoid bodies. 
* He has an space-cadet quality to him that may come from being not quite human.
* Would it be a stretch to say that his occasional deep insights and revelations are because he is a non-human entity?
* I'm not saying Pillboi is God, but wouldn't that be funny? That'd sure go a long way to supporting his brief existence in Janet's void.


As evaluators, I believe that they are biased, as they consistently do things that push Michael and Eleanor toward becoming better people. 
 
## Major Investigation Phases
 
### Phase 1 - Data Collection Phase


This phase was used to collect enough data to devise a theory: humans can improve enough to get into The Good Place if given an opportunity.  (All of season 1 and most of season 2) 
 
The Reboots are by design to test different pairings, configurations and scenarios.  A proper evaluation requires lots of data!  They are also a test to see how well Michael copes with repeated failure and opposition.
 
Eleanor and Chidi overhearing the dissatisfied demons complaining about the reboots in S02E03 - again, this was by design. After the reboots were finished and countless test scenarios were complete, it was then time to get ready for the next phase of the project by traveling to The Bad Place and then on to see Gen.


### Phase 2 - Testing Phase


The above theory is tested in a version of Earth.  This test fails spectacularly and but the group does land on a second theory: life is complicated and unintended consequences of every action has doomed all of humanity for the forseeable future. (S02E13 and all of Season 3)
 
The Snap in ""Somewhere Else"" (S02E13) represented a turning point in the system test. A vast amount of data had been collected up until this point, and TPTB had landed on the theory that could be tested - humans can be good and get into The (real) Good Place if given an opportunity for self-improvement. With that theory in hand, the next phase of the system test commenced: seeing if the Eleanor can improve and live a good, moral on earth and continue improving, and to evaluate if Michael can adapt to a new situation, provide guidance and continue to care for his friends. Once they are back on earth, Chidi appears confident and charismatic in his Youtube videos and subsequent appearances (at least for a little while), and that is partly to ensure that Eleanor is drawn to him. He is a lure because he is part of the test, not the one being tested.
 
Further, I posit that the Post Office wasn't actually in The Good Place. It was merely a construct. While there, the committee presented a 400 year timeframe (just to select investigators!) to Michael to light a fire under his butt.  A committee already exists, has for a while, and are currently executing their plan, and that is the show!


### Phase 3 - Testing Phase 2 - Season 4! 


We just don't know yet! 


## Other Characters Roles


**Mindy **  - When visiting Mindy the first time, a brain (Janet) and an evaluator (Jason) accompany Eleanor to both guide her and keep an eye on her. Mindy's main purpose is to give Eleanor a nudge in the right direction (which appears to be into Chidi's pants).


** Gen **  - an obstacle in S3 to evaluate Michael as he attempts to save his friends by keeping them on a morally upward trajectory.  Further, when Gen visits earth in S03E12, the cause of the system failure has been identified (unintended consequences) another phase in the system test commences: new neighbourhood with new subjects.  Except, in this theory, but Michael and Eleanor are still the subjects, but they just don't know it.


** Shawn **  - his constant threats to Michael to retire him if there is another failure or reboot are a test to see how Michael responds under pressure. His menacing and threatening of Michael in S03E12 are another manifestation of this.


** Simone **  - Like Vicki, she is a test to see how Eleanor deals with romantic competition. Vicki was the easy version of the test, and Simone is the expert level.  Now that Simone is in the neighbourhood with an ostensibly memory-wiped Chidi this test will be very difficult for Eleanor.


Frog Man - I wish I had a good argument about the Doorman, but mostly I just appreciate his existence. 


** Eleanor's mom **  exists to illustrate to Eleanor that people can grow, change and become better people.  She also exists to evaluate Eleanor's response to seeing her provide more love and better parenting to her step daughter than she ever provided to Eleanor.


** Vicki **  tests both Eleanor and Michael:
* testing Eleanor to examine how she responds when presented with someone who is objectively a better person than her
* romantic competition with Eleanor
* she also tests to see how Michael deals with disgruntled, complaining insubordinates.


** Derek ** is a big ball of chaos energy whose role is to throw a monkey wrench into the proceedings. Pretty much ever scene with him is a test scenario.


** Trevor **  is another monkey wrench. Further, his constant negative talk and negging are a test using Eleanor to see if she will live up (down?) to his vision of her, or if she will rise above to be a better person.


** Bad Janet **  is just there to be as offensive as possible. *FARTNOISE* I love her.


** Doug Forcett **  may be the reason that this system test and investigation was instigated in the first place. He figured out the system, stacked the odds in his favour, and *still* lost. Alternatively, it is possible he was one of the first test subjects to evaluate the performance of the point system in the modern era. 


## The Actual Good and Bad Places
 
I don't think we've seen either of them.  I like to think this test is being run in isolation from the rest of the existence: in the dot over the i. Jeremy Bearimy, baby.  


In S02E10, Michael presents the faulty getaway hot-air balloon, but then confesses that he can't actually find a way to get to the Good Place. The reason he can't, is because there really is no way to get to the real good place from the show's self-contained evaluation bubble. 
 
The (Fake) Bad Place: While in the neighbourhood, the constant threat of sending Eleanor, Jason, Chidi or Tahani to The Bad Place is a test wherein Michael is the subject. This option was not presented by Michael, instead it came from an outside influence (Trevor, Shawn). It's primary purpose is to see if he will actually do it - if he did, that would indicate that he failed the test of learning to care for others. In S01E13, Shawn decides that they can choose any two of the four to go to the Bad Place. This is a also a test, one of Eleanor's newfound selflessness. 


## Arguments against this theory


I am sure there are a great many, but one of the things that throws me about this theory is that we have had scenes with The Brainy Bunch and The Soul Squad that fly in the face of it:
* the scenes showing Tahani, Jason and Chidi's lives on earth prior to dying the first time 
* Gen's test of Tahani makes no sense in this scenario. 
* Kamilah - all your fears are mine now. Honestly, I'm not sure what role she plays in this theory other than to debunk it. 
* John, the gossip columnist and Tahani's nemesis makes no sense in this scenario, other than to give Eleanor another problem to deal with.


## Finally


After writing this, I am not entirely convinced that the test subjects are human. 


Much like Doug Forcett, this theory came to me in a flash of insight while high (weed, not shrooms). Still, I think it pans out.


TL;DR - The Powers That Be know the afterlife is forked up, but they don't know why or how to fix it. The events of TGP are an evaluation of the system to identify the flaws and determine how the system can be improved. Michael and Eleanor are the test subjects. Janet and Chidi are the test scenario designers / architects. Tahani and Jason are the evaluators.

My only major complaint is that I hate the concept of resetting in the show. I think the first time it's done, its amusing, but even at the time, I was hoping it'd be a one-time deus ex machina. And then the whole 45 minute episode revolves around it, and it just gets exhausting. But hey, it works as a way to set up the second season, I suppose.

But then it happens again in season 3, and at that point it was irritating. I just get annoyed watching an entire season's worth of progress wiped away from the characters, just so they can repeat the exact same relationship cycles over and over again. It's not very interesting, when we know what the outcome is gonna be, and doesn't really pose any deeper questions past the first time it's done. All the characters are caught up to speed within an episode or two anyway.

And then of course, the big stinger at the end of season 3 is Chidi getting his memory erased. But it's like... who cares? We already know that Eleanor and Chidi will get back together every time.

Eleanor/Chidi: You believe the only thing sexier than opposites attract is strict adherence to canon. Alternatively, your ideal high school romance is rebel and nerd.

Tahani/Jason: You may not be morosexual, but youre definitely morocurious. Alternatively, your ideal high school romance is prep and jock.

Janet/Jason: You just want nice things for Janet, and really, who doesnt?

Eleanor/Michael: You dont necessarily want to fork dads, but you definitely want to fork father figures.

Eleanor/Jason: Your favorite stories always include the line hijinks ensue.

Jason/Chidi: Your ideal high school romance is nerd and jock.

Eleanor/Tahani: You believe in the inherent eroticism of opposites attract, and disaster lesbians. Alternatively, your ideal high school romance is prep and rebel.

Tahani/Chidi: Your idea high school romance is prep and nerd.

Chidi/Simone: You dont want to say youre a sapiosexual but you could listen to a date talk about science or philosophy for hours. You also like that this completely frees up Eleanor for Tahani.

Eleanor/Simone: You really wish Eleanor did the plan to break Chidi and Simone up.

Michael/Chidi: You would read an enemy to lovers fic about the good and bad shoulder angels.

Janet/Michael: Your ideal romance involves no actual sex. You just like the idea of life partners.

Michael/Trevor: You really have a thing for redemption arcs on top of redemption arcs.

Eleanor/Tahani/Chidi: You think love triangles are close minded and a waste of story space.

Eleanor/Simone/Chidi: Honestly the same as above.

Eleanor/Tahani/Simone/Chidi: Youre worse at making decisions than Chidi is.

Also, it's just a crazy theory and it doesn't add up perfectly but bear with me all the same.

So in season one, Vicky, posing for real Eleanore, tells her (fake) backstory. She was abandoned at birth, found and adopted by the Shellstrops and then they died when she was four.

On the other hand, we later learn (in season 3 I think) that Eleanore's mother, who she thought dead, actually faked her death and remarried.

What if. Vicky's fake backstory was actually true, that she was indeed adopted by the Shellstrops, then they faked their deaths, moved elsewhere and had another baby that they also named Eleanore.

Vicky obviously didn't die at the same time as Eleanore since she's part of the scam with the other demons. Say Mrs Shellstrops adopted Vicky when she was 25, abandoned her at 29 and got Eleanore a few years later. Eleanore's 37 now, so Eleanore's mother would be 66. She does look a bit younger than that but I mean [look at Madonna](https://insidemag.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/madonna-montre-quoi-ressemble-corps-devetu-60ans-1020x536.jpg).

It has been revealed that Tahani was sent to the bad place despite her contributions to the world because of her corrupt motives. This is a deontological approach to ethics, such as Kantian ethics.

However, it is also revealed that Chidi was sent to the bad place because he makes people around him miserable, despite him trying to do the right thing while having no ill intentions. This is a consequentialist approach to ethics, such as Utilitarianism. 

Either the narrative is contradictory, or more than likely, the point system is very strict and nigh impossible. It combines consequentialism and deontologicalism: do the right thing while having the right consequence. The result is having impossible situations that will deduct points no matter which action you choose being very common.

Lets take it to the extreme. For example, a murderer who wants to kill your room mate turned up infront of your appartment. He asked you for the location of your roommate. If you told him the truth, he will locate and kill your roommate. If you lie, he will not find your roommate.

Immanuel Kant will say never lie. If your roommate is killed, it is no fault of yours.
John Mill will say if you can save a life and prevent a murder, go ahead and and lie. The good place will say points will be deducted either way.

I've been hearing alot of people, myself included, ask why is Chidi, an ethical philosophy professor out of everyone, in the bad place? The short answer is obviously: his indecisiveness! But, as I'm sure most of you who have dealt with this type of behavior before can guess, Chidi is indecisive due to a classic case of generalized anxiety disorder. So, why would someone who suffers from a disorder be put in a bad place as a sort of punishment? Well, that's what I think the show is all about. I don't believe they're being judged by some point system--it's all just a ruse. There is no ""good"" place and ""bad"" place with a black and white morality system. I believe it's the show's criticism of societies (and perhaps religions) view on morality. Especially with philosophers like Kant. So, what is the afterlife in this show all about? It's about self-overcoming-- being able to break free from the cycles that plagued you on Earth. In this way, we all create our own ""bad place."" A type of hell that we trap ourselves in throughout our daily lives. I think alot of this comes from Nietzsche's way of thinking, but I'll get into that later.

Let's start with Chidi and Tahani. Both of them seem like an ""ideal"" good person. Neither of them have done anything society deemed wrong. Chidi is constantly concerned about the morality of his actions, while Tahani is constantly donating money to charity (even if its for the wrong reasons). So, why would they be in the bad place? Well, one could say ""obviously Tahani is there because she's donating her money for attention."" But, I would think you're wrong. What is one thing both Chidi and Tahani have in common? They're trapped by some aspect of their life that won't allow them to be happy. Chidi obviously has a disorder that has gotten in the way of his life, his relationships, ect. He has spent his entire life trying to find the answers so he can finally overcome his inability to choose.. but what does that give him? A massive book that goes in circles. In the end, he allows his disorder to entrap him. Personally, after having dated someone who suffers from the same disorder, I see alot of similarities in how it negatively impacts their life and the lives of those around them. Tahani suffers equally. She might not have a clinically diagnosable disorder, as far as I can tell, but she's definitely in the same kind of hell that Chidi and the rest find themselves in. In that way, it is a type of ""disorder."" A disorder is something that chronically and negatively impacts a person's daily life. This, I think, definitely applies to Tahani's inability to self-overcome. She is obviously entrapped by the idea that out-shining her sister will bring her happiness. Instead, she is constantly met with disappointment. The harder she tries to out-do her sister, the harder she falls and the more miserable she becomes. If she, instead, learned to overcome her need for the validation of others, she could learn to be happy, and we even see her begin to do this after her near death experience. 

Eleanor and Jason are on the opposite end of the spectrum. They're what society would consider to be ""bad."" Jason is constantly in trouble with the law and does drugs. Eleanor is selfish and antisocial. Neither of them are what we would consider productive members of society. But, are they bad eggs by choice, or because they're also entrapped in a similar situation and unable to self-overcome? Eleanor is another character I can personally relate with. I suffer from an antisocial personality as a result of a not-so-pleasant upbringing. It makes you resent accepting help from others. It gives you a bitter outlook on the world and others. It makes you despise being part of a group and love independence.. even to the point of isolation. Eleanor has trouble forming meaningful relationships and her inability to take responsibility for her actions leaves her with little to no meaningful accomplishments in her life. Jason, on the other hand, well.. his situation is a bit more, shall I say, simple? Jokes aside, Jason is probably suffering from some sort of learning disorder.. or maybe, after learning who his father is, I can see how it could also just be a result of his upbringing. 

So, if all of these characters are suffering from a mental disorder to some degree, why in Earth would they be punished for it? The answer is: They aren't! The afterlife is a way for them to get a second chance,  to finally become the person they've always wanted to be, but never knew how. I believe this show is a criticism on how we view people-- how we have this notion that people are either ""good"" or ""bad."" It's showing us that the bitter, the criminals, the self-righteous, and the cowardly aren't necessarily ""bad."" It's showing us that each of these people are all still people, just struggling in their own way, entrapped by something they never asked for. What really makes a person happy or ""good"" is their ability to escape their own hell. 

Earlier I said I would talk about Nietzsche and Kant and how they relate to this show. I only have a basic understanding of philosophy, but the show seems to heavily revolve around these two schools of thought and how they oppose eachother. Early in the show, we see Chidi talking alot about Kant and his moral imperative. Kant was a black and white moralist who was heavily criticized by Nietzsche in the same way this show seems to criticize our notion of ""good"" and ""bad."" He even claims the failings of this broken morality system can ultimately lead people into adopting a self-destructive philosophy called Nihilism-- which we see happen to Chidi in season 3 (shout out to the ""God is dead"" scene, absolutely hilarious).  Nietzsche argues that morality is beyond good and evil. He, too, is heavily invested in the idea of self-overcoming. He believes it is the basic drive of all living things to overcome themselves and their environment. Ideally, it is the goal of mankind, and really the entire purpose of life, is to progress. The ideal man, Nietzsche's ""ubermensch"" will be able to self-overcome on his own. In the show, we start to see the characters slowly start to accomplish this goal as they learn from their mistakes. Eleanor is taking responsibility and learning to be part of something, Jason is learning from his father's mistakes, Tahani is finally shedding her need for publicity, and Chidi is learning how to make decisions for himself.

It's all about testing human capacity for personal growth. In the end they'll be reincarnated in a different Jeremy Bearimy timeline/universe under different circumstances. No overt torture prison or pleasure palace - just another slice of life among the metaverse. This ties into the 5% or so of the afterlife that Buddhists were correct on.

Also Michael is not a ""demon"". He's another human being tested by Sean/Gen and given false memories to see how he adapts. He only has any power to aid his role as an architect, and it's by design.

In fact, there are no demons or angels at all. They are all humans being tested against each other at various points. The ""people"" tortured in the Bad Place are simulations as in the Trolley Problem; they are only there to test the ""demons"". Chidi is recognized in season 2 because he once was tasked as a demon torturer until he had a moral epiphany and was allowed to move on to another plane of existence. His friend has yet to grow, but still remembers him.

Those who reach moral nirvana are allowed to become judges if they so choose, such as Sean and Gen. Their task is to use their full knowledge and ability to craft useful scenarios for helping other humans engage their moral weaknesses and attempt to move on to their next life in the Jeremy Bearimy Metaverse. Those who decline are allowed to rest for a time in ""The Good Place"" they became familiar with in earlier tests or restart their spiritual journey all over again with new memory should they choose to do so.

Janet is everything, and all Janets are silently connected. She is a construct created by the first humans.

344,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2019-9-17,2019,9,17,3,d54gxd,self.TheGoodPlace,I think the webisodes gave away a lot more than people think.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/d54gxd/i_think_the_webisodes_gave_away_a_lot_more_than/,ARandomOgre,1568659261,"So I just watched the webisodes yesternight, and we see some footage that takes place *after* the main experiement, but before the new one, and it *only* contains demons, which means they aren't putting on a show for anyone. My thoughts:

1) The demons are actually demons. There was no one around, and they still acted like demons and clearly delight in torturing people. The way they talk when alone does not hint that they are anything other than demons.

2) Which, I think, disproves entirely the idea that Michael is actually the one being tortured here. Mostly, this comes from the fact that the webisodes reveal that the demons are actually worried they might fail and that the Bad Place might be affected by this failure. This isn't part of the act, since Michael nor the humans were in the room. Clearly, if their plan was to torture Michael and the restart of the fake Good Place was part of that plan, they wouldn't be worried about failing.

3) While I haven't noticed any mention of a Supreme Architect (God), there does seem to be some binding power to the rules of the point system that even demons are, at least outwardly, obligated to abide by. Whether it's somehow enforced by the Judge (who doesn't seem powerful enough to truly be God), by an actual god of some sort, or by some other force, the result is that the demons can't simply do whatever they want, and that breaking the rules is ""cheating"", which seems to worry some of the demons, one in particular.

4) Glenn. Glenn's worried about breaking the rules. As a demon. Given that he was happily torturing the humans during most of the show, it seems that he isn't against the way that the Bad Place operates, but that he does respect (or fear) whatever the source of authority is in the afterlife enough to worry about ""cheating"" the system. Perhaps he just truly believes in the mission of the Bad Place and believes that its merits can stand on their own, but I'm trying to remember if there were other instances (like the illegal gate to Earth) where he voiced his concerns.

**Ultimately**, I think this hints at Glenn (or other demons) perhaps subverting Shawn's attempts to manipulate the new experiment and playing a role in how this all shakes out. Clearly, the demons can't simply do whatever they want, and are being held in check by some sort of authority, whether a god or simply a code respected by divinities on both sides of the line. The webisodes show that this experiment has become a bit of an obsession for Shawn, perhaps enough for him to have lost his way, and that his ultimate downfall will come from his desire to *turn* good(ish) people bad, rather than simply punishing those who are already bad (which is what the other demons had originally signed up for).

This show is ultimately one about redemption, and while Shawn's perspective is one that is stereotypically evil and uncompromising, the perspective of other demons might be that Shawn has changed their mission from punishment to corruption. It's a different sort of evil, and maybe we start to see some demons (like Glenn) wrestling with the concept of ""wrong"" in corrupting salvageable souls when their entire job is to torture people for an eternity.

Just my thought.",4,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

Mindy dramatically swings the trial in favor of the corporation on a technicality. As Mindy exits the courthouse, the elderly lady confronts her with: How can you live with yourself?! Mindy cooly replies: I only look out for numero uno. Now if youll excuse me, this coke isnt gonna snort itself... 

Second flashback: Shes sitting at home and, with the words of the defendant replaying in her head, gets blitzed and begins frantically working on her rescue alliance foundation. Cut to the next morning, a sobered up Mindy is withdrawing her life savings, blueprint for the alliance in her purse, ready to start the charity. As shes walking down into the subway station, a guy almost runs her over in an attempt to steal her purse and the money in it. She deftly defends herself and leaves him a mess. As shes standing over him, she smugly says something about needing no one to take care of her and how much she wishes people would just leave her alone. You see the weight of her words flash across her face briefly and she takes a step backwards, where she falls onto the fated third rail. 

The final scene: She wakes up in her medium place, confused. She walks around, taking in the environment while calling out for someone and making vague threats to whoever kidnapped her. She steps into the living room to see the VHS sitting on the coffee table, an off-brand post-it note on the front reading: *For Mindy.* She pops it in the VCR as Beadie and Trevor begin informing her of her fate.

I believe that this reboot won't be a simple ""fix"" for Simone not to be a problem in The Good Place.

I'm thinking that Chidi will simply fall in love with Simone, just like on Earth, and not with Eleanor anymore.

Of course, I'm not saying it won't eventually change by the end of the season; I'm just saying this might happen at some point.

What do you think?

 Humans are ultimately pretty good; even the bad ones can be good; trying to be good matters
 The conditions of the world make people worse; when people behave badly, theres usually a reason 
 Our friends and chosen family make our lives better, and make us better as humans

She told me that there would be a twist, but didn't tell me what it was. So I spent the whole first season waiting for the twist, and came up with some pretty random theories along the way that I thought y'all might like. For the first season, I was absolutely convinced that Eleanor actually wasn't the mistake; that the neighborhood was a test for 321 people who were borderline, to see if they'd be willing to accept, forgive, and help reform a so-called bad person. I thought Chidi would teach her Western philosophy, Jianyu would teach her Eastern (when he came to her with the 'you don't belong here' letter, for one second I was absolutely convinced I had cracked the code), and they and Tahani would learn a lot about accepting imperfect people, and realizing their own flaws and limitations.

Another one I had was that this was actually Michael's version of being in the Bad Place (I know some people still think this one; I'm pretty sure that's not the case) because of the way 'retirement' was described and how he kept having panic attacks all the time.

As we gear up to watch the final season of our favorite half hour of comedy, I realized some tidbits about this series and WHY it's been so so GOOD for us in the later half of the 2010's ;) 

The writers room put a LOT of work into their  scripts over the last several years so that we TRULy thought about pop culture, ethics, our own nature, and actually had an emotional connection to the characters they developed from pages of a script to our tv screens. This of course was accomplished by stellar acting styles but by heavy character development plotlines. Wouldn't it be great if more shows brought awareness to things we SHOULD be thinking about?

After looking at some theories of final season plot twists it's so amazing to see the reaction that this show has inspired.

1) All the characters represent personality traits that we can all recognize about ourselves and/or would like to change. Our motivation has to be pure...this will come back for sure in the final season.
2) Earth kinda is a medium place.... Perfection is not real while we are here on earth. Check out Season 1 Ep. 11 (Mindy St. Clair) to catch some themes that are sure to come back into this season. 
3) Janet, like all technology is becoming more and more human and has the possibility for takeover. Notice before her first reboot she had already been rebooted several times. Not a coincidence....
4) It is possible for humans to change
5) Jason is pure and has a heart of gold. Though technically he is a criminal, he sees the world through innocent ""7 year old"" eyes...this is key. 
6) Forgiveness is key and a major theme. So is love being unselfish...
7) What ever happened to Vickie as Michael in Pandemonium (Season 3 finale) ? Some theories say she is Simone. This is going to be a key point to watch out for her....

Sadly, this will be the final season of our beloved show, but all good things must come to an end. Schur sitcoms are no different. Here are some things to keep in mind as we await the inevitable.

___
#Time Change: Thursdays @ 9PM on NBC

* The show has changed time slots to **9PM.** (Its been pushed up half an hour.)

* Threads will still go up at the same time, **8:30PM,** a half-hour before the episode debuts so everyone has time to find it and settle in. The thread for the latest episode will always be stickied to the top of the sub.

* Links to every episode discussion thread can be found in the sidebar if you need a refresher. [Heres a direct link if youre on mobile.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thegoodplace/wiki/config/sidebar)

___
#Search Before You Post: Doug, Mindy, Lincoln, Columbus, Chidis French, etc.

(Warning: all the links in this section contain tons of spoilers.)

Questions about [Doug](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/search?q=Doug+Forcett&amp;restrict_sr=on) and [Mindy](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/search?q=Mindy&amp;restrict_sr=on) have been asked many, many times before. Your groundbreaking theory has probably been covered already. Post it again at your peril.

#Rules

Our rules here are pretty simple:

[**Practice Reddiquette.**](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) (TL;DR: Be kind to each other. Disagree without being disagreeable. Be the Good Place.)

**Dont spoil.** Specifically this means:

1. **No title spoilers.** Titles cant be changed, so your post will have to be nuked if the ***title*** contains spoilers. (Spoilers are fine in the ***body*** of a text post, however.)

2. **Flair your post** with a season number, no spoilers or shirtpost (memes, which are spoilers all.) If you dont pick a flair, the bot will take down your post and PM you. Reply to the PM with a flair to have your post reinstated. (Shout out to my hero, bot author u/kungming2. Youre the Good Place.)

3. **Hide comment spoilers** with a `&gt;!spoiler tag!&lt;` &gt;!that will look like this!&lt; if youre talking about something that happens *after* the OP. (e.g., Its an S1 thread, but you want to reference something from S3. Thats fine, `&gt;!just cover up those bits!&lt;` with a spoiler tag.) ***Never put spaces next to the exclamation pointsthat will break the Markdown.***

Report any post or comment that breaks one of these rules.

If your post or comment has been removed, now you know why. But if you need further clarification you can always [send a ModMail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTheGoodPlace)

___
#Classic or New Reddit

This sub can be viewed in [Classic Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/) or [New Reddit.](https://new.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/) We recommend Classic Reddit as it offers more spoiler protection and some exclusive features:

* Click on shirtless Chidi in the sidebar to filter out shirtposts. (Hide the memes.)

* Click on S1, S2 or S3 under Chidi to only show posts up to that season. (For fans still catching up.)

* [And theres also emoji](https://www.reddit.com/r/thegoodplace/wiki/emoji) which only works in Classic Reddit:

Have a [shrimp,](#Shrimp) weve got plenty. Can I offer you a [jalapeno popper?](#Jalapeno) Or how bout a bump of [cocaine?](#Cocaine)

But if you still want to use New Reddit, you are strongly advised ***NOT*** to use Card View, or ***you will be spoiled.*** Card View shows the content of all posts, irrespective of post flair, and its New Reddits default setting. Set your view preference at the top to Classic or Compact instead.

#Mobile

The biggest issue on mobile seems to be finding the sidebar, but you can usually access that in the upper-right corner. There should be an info button: a lowercase i with a circle around it. Tap that and the sidebar should come up. Sometimes the info button is hidden under a hamburger menu or three vertical dots, it depends on the app.

Most apps respect the spoiler comment tags and color-coded spoiler post flairs. (Clear for No Spoilers, Yellow for a specific Season, Blue for Shirtposts / Spoilers All.) If yours doesnt, find a better app.

Also, if the group is starting to splinter due to stresses (the new residents driving the Soul Squad crazy, and causing fighting/dissention/etc.) it would help them reconnect and work as a team, ironically thwarting the intentions of the Bad Place.

Id argue this means theyre in the Good Place for real. Now, I know Doug Forcett got his picture taken and he is going to the bad place, but hear me out. 
The accomplishments beneath their photos are all overcoming their biggest obstacle to get into TGP. And if Jason managed to do good brain stuff but ended up going to TBP, why would that matter? His brain stuff wasnt good enough. 

Same thought process for the rest of them. Eleanor found her squad  overcame her selfishness. Weve already learned from her test with the Judge she couldve made it to the good place by herself.

Chidi trusted his gut, pretty simple. 

Tahani got over herself  That was her biggest problem. She was on her high horse and did everything for attention. 

Michael conquered his demons. Simple. 

Janet had a feeling. I feel like theres more to that, but i dont know.

Therefore, they all fixed the afterlife, and in doing so they fixed themselves and made it to TGP. Thats my theory by the end of Season 4.",3,12,False,self,,,,,

One of the most powerful parts about the Season One ending (besides how neat it was to watch for the first time), is that it forces all of the characters to confront their own selves and actions. They had to really reflect on their characters and ask themselves where they went wrong. Season 3 takes that all away because the answer could very well be ""you didn't, but literally nobody makes it, so whatever.""

It also takes the theme and premise into a far less interesting direction. Where before the show centered around growth, reflection, and change, this twist makes it more of a standard external conflict where they have to beat the evil bad guys/system. And that's fine, I guess. Even if that's where they go, I'm sure it will still have some funny episodes and great acting, but at its heart the show could be more, and *has* been more, and it would be a shame to lose that.

I mean, I'm still going to watch season 4, and if anyone has earned some forbearance and trust that it will all make sense, it's these guys, but as things stand now I'm not thrilled with the overall direction it's taking.",16,29,False,self,,,,,

Discuss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/d7swtt/beings_in_tgp_universe_have_the_ability_to/,SkippingPebbless,1569170357,"Of all the ""flaws"" I've ever perceived in the show, this one hits the hardest for me. The fact that there are beings - even ostensibly lower beings in the hierarchy of high-beings (demons like Michael) - who can completely blank out all or parts of your memory of your past, essentially completely altering the essence of who you are. This in theory completely voids any purpose in the scoring of ""points"" of goodness or badness, because anything you may have once done can no longer really be attributed to you if some part of your past is erased from you.  


To put it another way: if you did something bad in 2013, and then a demon were to choose to wipe your memory going back to 2012, ANYTHING you did from 2013 forward that may have attributed to your point total can't really be something you are held accountable for anymore because who it is that you are post-wipe is inherently different from who you were between 2012-2019. Basically the version of you that did anything during that time frame no longer exists.  


And if it's that easy to completely reshape the essence of a human, why not take them - after death - and weed out everything about them that ever contributed to a bad deed or point? Oh, free will, you say? Well obviously free will doesn't \*actually\* matter if higher beings are willing and able to manipulate the memories, and thereby fundamental essence of the soul, of humans.

Anyway, just looking for thought provoking conversation on this topic. Not saying I'm right or wrong or that there's something wrong with the show. I just find it fascinating that essentially in TGP universe, what exists after death is more or less a 'soul' that lives on, but that these souls can be completely manipulated by higher beings in such a fashion as to essentially completely alter their fundamental essence in a way that voids a great deal of what made them the people they were to begin with to lead them to the good or bad place.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Okay, you're gonna have to hear me out on this one. I have a theory that I'm constantly going back and forth on so I'm just gonna put it out in the universe, if by some MIRACE, I'm correct.

Here we have: Eleanor Shellstrop, posing EXACTLY like Doug Forcett's hall of fame picture.

Now look at the top left. 

It's been a trip.

It's been a forking TRIP.

They're high on whatever Dough smoked OR this is all an interpretation of Dough's long monologue on how the afterlife works. I know there are a lot of facts and details that makes this IMPOSSIBLE but maybe that's where Jeremy Bearimy takes place. (when in doubt, blame it on Jeremy Bearimy) 

I just know the ending might have to do with 2 things: MUSHROOMS and DOUG FORCETT

Its insanely convoluted and kinda confusing but its good. I have a question. How was Doug supposed to be the best person and getting all those points when he was doing it just to get into The Good Place? He knew about it so wouldnt his acts of goodness not be counted for as much because of the fact that he was just doing it to get in? Also isnt there a picture of him in Michaels office? I think I remember them talking about him in one of the first episodes how he guessed the closest something or other and thats why hes up there. How would they know he was so good if they points werent calculating right anymore? Does he just happen to be known for two different things? Or was the guess related to guessing the afterlife, therefore hes the only one who knows and thats why hes the best?

I feel like the system is too complicated to change the whole metrics of everything and if they do it could take DECADES to figure out a new formula (as the good place committee stated) and that means millions just goes straight to the bad place until they figure something out. 
I believe that the Judge is going to allow them to make a MEDIUM place for the medium people until they figure out how to change the system or keep the Test Place (that they have now) as a new form of figuring out where people go (good place or bad place).",2,9,False,self,,,,,

The way I remember it is, the group wanted to prove that they weren't an anomaly and that any 'bad' person who found themselves accidentally placed in the good place would strive to become better.  The bit that bugs me is... None of the people they chose have any reason to believe they didn't get into the real good place on their own merits, so what would prompt the realisation that they need to be better? They've literally been told that they're good enough - why would they question it?

While typing this, it occurred to me that perhaps the intention is that people will strive to be better because they're surrounded by good people and not because they believe they're 'bad'.  There's still a slight flaw, in that this plan relies on demons realistically being good people, but it's less flawed than my initial interpretation.  Is that what I missed?",19,7,False,self,,,,,

Third. And I cant believe I never realised this. As a fat Australian who loves American candy I shoulda noticed it, but I just didnt. In no supermarket, anywhere in Australia, can you buy peeps. Nowhere. There is a small store called USA foods that imports American candy. Theyve had a shop in Melbourne for decades (been going there for at least 20 years) and they recently opened a shop in Sydney.

Jason will say something really profound that only we the audience get.

The Judge will now be the main character.

Chidi will show off more of his hot bod.

 Eleanor will remember what she learned not just from Chidi, but also from Simone and demand that the Judge reboot them all over and over, as many times as it takes, because their experiments don't prove anything without being repeated with a massive sample size. Shawn will interject and demand that if this is going to happen, they should use different humans. 

At that point, the judge will take dozens of people from the Bad Place and put them in neighborhoods and we will be treated to a montage of humans getting better and we will also see Eleanor and Chidi find each other over and over again.

Based on this, is it possible that Eleanor and Jason are in a way better people at the start than Tahani and Chidi?

And with the cliffhanger in mind, there is something , that doesn't make sense to me. But also new thoughts about the over all concept.


So I am gonna start with those.

And yeah Spoilers.

So in season 2 we learn that the neighborhood is build as a place for four humans to torche each other. Those for humans are selected to be not compatible with each other. They would drive each other insane...
But there are a lot of scenes when they don't. And  I guess I know why. 

For years demons learned that it doesn't matter what humans do, they end up in the bad place.  But i guess, they do not know why the score is so low. They don't realize complicated consequences leads to the low score. 

I always thought... Why would the bad place put someone like a moral ethics professor to the neighborhood? Wouldn't it be risky for the whole projekt? 
No, because they think people do not change. 
So it don't matter,  if it is a professor of philosophy, or about chemistry 

In flashbags we see Eleanore not want to be part of any team. (episode 9)
So the demons think, that in the afterlife she wouldn't want to be in one too. 
So she would hurt her new friends. 
But she changed, and so did thahani and Chidi. 



Ah and here the thing that don't make sense to me: good Janet. 

I get, that they needed a good Janet to make the fraud believable. 
But how come, that Janet's actions fit Michael's plans in hurting the humans so good? 
I know that she is not the super upgraded version yet, but still.",1,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

We know that our Janet is as advanced as she is due to being rebooted so many times. We dont know if Derek works that way, but it can be assumed. We also dont know who the Bad Place intended to send to mess with Jason, but many have noted that Derek seems to be filling that role just fine coincidentally.

So heres the theory. Last night we found out that Mindy St Claire has rebooted Derek a lot. Sometimes for alone time, sometimes just for fun. If he works like Janet, that means he is much more capable now than he ever has been before.

The Bad Place has done numerous things to screw with the experiment. They chose to send humans specifically meant to mess with our group, they sent a demon disguised as a human, and many are even theorizing that they switched out Michael with fake Michael at the end of last nights episode. Whos to say they havent done more, or set up more?

Now Ive already said that Derek could have specifically been told by the Bad Place to mess with Jason, but I think he was also told to offer to create the neighborhood with Janet. That way he could put in some bugs and mess with the neighborhood to make it that much harder to redeem the new humans.

What really happened with Michael at the end of this new episode? Lets look at the clues that the writers and editors have set up for us...

In the opening montage, the Michael Suit that the Bad Placers have developed is highlighted. Why is this reviewed?
Shawns Team sends in Chris Baker disguised as a human. He flies off the handle and blows his cover. He kept his cool for centuries under Michaels rule but blows up after two days in the new experiment. Why?
The Bad Place sends a train to get Chris. Michael goes off screen, comes back (hair a bit mussed, pocket square slightly askew). Then he gives the message Booyah to Shawn.
Bad Janet insults Eleanor for not detecting the fake, saying she would be too stupid.
Conclusion: Shawns team has captured Michael and are taking him to the Bad Place. He has been replaced with a demon (Vicky most likely) who is now in the Michael suit. Bad Janet was needling Team Cockroach about it. Chris Baker was a red herring.

I was listening to the Podcast for the most recent episode, and the writers were discussing how challenging it was to find a way to surprise the viewers and not be predictable, while also thinking like a Bad Place demon and doing something that they would do.

So let's look at the facts, because something doesn't add up about the apparent plan to have Chris Baker as a sleeper agent, or to swap out Michael with Fake Michael.

1. Shawn isn't dumb, but his arguments against having Chidi in the study were. He compared swapping in Chidi to studying for a test and learning the material. That argument is so unbelievably bad, no one would imagine that he was seriously advancing it, if it wasn't for the sneer on his face and outrage in his tone. Both easily faked for a demon.

2. Shawn had to know that the judge wouldn't buy his terrible argument, so Shawn wanted Chidi to be a participant in the experiment.

3. Let's work backwards from the supposition that Shawn wanted Chidi in the experiment. Everything he did works towards that end. He made Simone a participant, not to torture Chidi, but to force them to erase his memories. 

4. He sends Chris Baker, the demon who is widely acknowledged as the worst demon actor by far to play a human. And had him playing a human whose personality was completely different from his own, knowing that he couldn't last long.

5. What's the outcome for the demons interfering with a fake human? It could **only** be making Chidi a test subject. He's already had his memories wiped, he's in the fake Good Place already, and making him a test subject instead of getting a new human from The Bad Place means that the judge can avoid having to reset the whole test, she doesn't have to screen more human candidates from the Bad Place, etc. Adding Chidi resolves the issue quickly and cleanly, and seems to be a punishment for The Bad Place.

6. So if the real goal was to get Chidi's memories erased and into the study... why? Because Michael has made it clear to the demons that the bond between Eleanor and Chidi is what made the group improve every time.

7. Chidi can teach ethics, but he needs Eleanor to teach him to be decisive. How long did he last before he walked away from Simone? A minute or two? He never gave up on Eleanor, but Eleanor wheedled and begged and coerced him into taking a chance on her. Simone doesn't want his help, and neither do the other new subjects, and that ruins Chidi's potential to improve.

8. So that's the real plan. To shoehorn Chidi into the study in a situation where can't improve because no one wants his help. When Chidi fails, he'll be the ""proof"" that even humans who appeared to improve in the first study didn't really change at all.

*Sidenote:* The Michael swap theory is okay, but too obvious for viewers to predict, so it has to be a distraction. I guessed it, you guessed it, half of reddit guessed it. And Shawn had no way of knowing that Michael would go onto the train himself. Even if he did go himself, he could have gone with Eleanor, Jason, Tahani, or even the Judge if she'd shown up. Too big of a gamble, not likely to pay off considering the high risk of failure. Plus, if Michael wasn't grabbed instantly, he might have yelled, fought, or done something that the humans and the Judge would see or hear. And same for Janet, who was with him and has already beaten multiple demons in multiple fights. No way do they both go quietly.",16,142,False,self,,,,,

Eleanor is the girl from Arizona.  The trash bag who KNEW, when she got to the Good Place, that she didn't belong.  Michael picked her for his neighborhood because the fear of being sent to the Bad Place as supposed to be part of her torture.  Eleanor, therefore, was motivated to change.  And she had such a persuasive personality that she convinced Chidi and Tahani and Jason to help her. 

The new test subjects do not have this motivation.  The gossip writer and the annoying executive take it for granted they ended up in the Good Place.  Simone things she is having a vivid dream as she is dying.   Chidi is just happy to be there.   None of them are motivated to become better people. 

The soul squad needs to introduce a new element into the experiment - someone who needs help and wants to change.   So I am guessing that one of two things will happen.  Option 1: There will be a new human or new Janet baby that is an Eleanor type - a trash bag of a person who thinks she needs to change or she will be tossed out of heaven.  Option 2:  and more likely in my opinion - Eleanor will ask to have her own mind wiped so that she can again seek out Chidi for help.  Eleanor will not be counted as part of the experiment, but she can motivate the other humans to be better people.   Eleanor doing this would pay off the episode title, because she would be just a girl from Arizona again, and not know that she was really the leader of an experiment to save humanity. 

It would be another sort of reboot, yes.  But I'm sure the writers could pull it off in an interesting way.",11,38,False,spoiler,,,,,

Here are some of mine.

Observation: The ""Medium Place"" is a neighborhood in the Bad Place.


Theory: It is not actually intended to be a medium place, and is, in fact, the perfect torture scenario for a high powered city dwelling, nympho maniac coke head attorney like Mindy Saint Claire because it's boring, rural, and lacks her favorite things, cocaine and sex/porn, at least until Derek shows up. But Derek, as far as we know, is a glitch.

Observation: The only person who has actually become a better person is Elenor. She consistently becomes a better person and changes her ways.

This is why Brent Norwalk upsets her when previously she had no problem with patronizing a coffee shop owned by a man who sexually assaulted a woman.

While Tahani reconciled with her sister, she has, in fact, not fundamentally changed, as demonstrated by the fact that she cares what John Wheaton thinks of her, and Chidi has not changed at all. He always thinks his sin was using almond milk despite it's environmental impact and can still not make simple decisions, even after this short coming is pointed out to him.

Jason is inherently bad.

Observation: Jason's character is continuosly minimized and presented as a purposless burden.

Theory: Jason actually has a much bigger role than writers are letting on and we just haven't been introduced to it yet.

Observation: They fail to ask Janet obvious questions about how to solve their problems. Is this a plot hole or by design?",6,13,False,spoiler,,,,,

As I was watching yesterday's episode, my mind kept wandering. I couldn't stop thinking about whether we're still watching the gang get tortured in the bad place. What if everything we've seen from season 2 was all a set up. Everyone we've met, the judge,  the mail lady, good place representatives, accountants are all in on the gig. I know it's crazy but it's possible they are being messed with. Them going to Earth, patching things up with their loved ones, Chidi asking to get his memories erased, everything is all part of the plan to torture.

It's like what Simone thinks is happening to her. We, the audience, is being shown one thing but it's all a fake.
