Yeah, there was a ton of stress for the characters due to everything Michael was doing, but like Eleanor said in the last few minutes, they really and truly made each other better. That's what I loved so much about the middle of the show. Just my kind of humor, constant high energy, great cheer, bright colors, fun, hope, laughter. 

On rewatch all of those things are still there, but indelibly stained. Deeper certainly, but also much more cruel. I thought it was brilliant that the last ep showed the truth of the marriage counseling scene; it implies that every scene was built similarly without quite explicitly saying so. It forces us to reevaluate basically every single interaction the ""extras"" ever had with the main 4 as meant to cause, even in small amounts: pain, anxiety, and general cruelty.

I have no one to discuss the show with, so if you are bored enough you can be subject to my thoughts.

The writing, structure is outstanding.  Ted Danson's performance is seriously impressive.  Loved Michael as a character, until the twist.  Kinda sad his character is kinda gone forever now, as a neurotic angel with faults he was so likeable and loveable.

The themes are great, more substantive than most TV.  I loved how they covered actual concepts, felt a bit like infotainment.  The look and feel of the world is great.   I loved how they took an absurd idea and took it seriously.  Many shows/films don't get that formula right.  Although the brimstone monster in the conference room was maybe a low point on that count.

The characters were generally good, with Janet being the real star.  The beach scene, all the social faux pas, come on!  Whoever came up with her marriage to Jason deserves a raise, she is the perfect foil to his stupidity.  

The flashback set pieces were all home runs, really flushes out the characters while universally being off the hook hilarious.  Production overall was just so good.

The twist ending was a real disappointment.  Sure, it sets up an interesting mechanic - a set of brain wiped characters have a mystery to solve.  I guess that's cool, but the twist simply ruined the whole feel of the show for me, and I'm seriously not interested in season 2.

I think I'm going to imagine that the series ended in episode 12? on the train with Janet declaring ""Ride or Die!"" before sending her, Jason and Elanor to the bad place.  That would have been the perfect ending for what up to that point was kind of a piece of narrative art.  A farce ending in tragedy.  2 undeserving souls who tried their best to earn a place in heaven, but in the end nobly sacrified themselves to spare true friends from eternal torture.  That would have put a particularly pungent cap on the show, perfectly constrasting what was up to that point a whistful, playfull look at the afterlife.  Similar to the end of the first Matrix film, at that point it felt like the character and story arcs had come to a perfect end.",6,6,False,self,,,,,

Chidi always had the best intentions, but his actions were not always entirely positive. Tahani, on the other hand, was the complete opposite; very philanthropic, inarguably good actions, but for reasons that were more selfish.

It baffles me how two complete opposites could both be destined for the same fate. Is the deciding factor in whether a person is good or not their intentions or their actions? I mean this question probably lies deeper than the show, but still would be nice to see some consistency.

And I know that this is everyone's complaint here on the subreddit, but it really baffles me that either of them are being sent to Bad Place. It's not like Chidi really ruined any lives, he may have inconvenienced some but that's it. And Tahani saved the lives of so many. No one would donate to charity if they didn't get some sort of gratification (albiet some more than others). Yes, she was a little rude at some points, but I don't think that all of those people who benefitted from her charity cared much about how much Tahani boosted her ego.

It was something like, ""Because there's nothing more human than taking a good thing and making it slightly worse so that you can have more of it.""

It's kind of a funny line, but it feels too philosophical to just be a throwaway line. I think it's a hint. 

There isn't a good place or a bad place. There's only the human place. Everyone goes there. Humans can't actually enjoy an eternity full of constant pleasure and satisfaction because it would be too much of a good thing. They would get bored in a perfect world with no obstacles to overcome. It would be as boring for them to live in as it would be for us to watch. So the architects create a good place, but intentionally make it slightly worse so that humans can enjoy it for eternity. Kind of like TV producers who never want their series to end.

If I can play Chidi for a second, this fits with the existential idea that suffering is inherent in existence and even in pleasure. We enjoy ourselves only when striving after something we don't have, but at the same time, not having that thing brings us suffering. It's like that spiel one of Dostoevsky's characters gives about how sticking a man in a perfect world would never satisfy him. His very human nature would make him do everything he could to fork it up just for kicks. Just to assert his freedom.

So the architects create situations where humans have to continually overcome obstacles that stand in the way of the good place. But they ensure these obstacles aren't too impossible to overcome. Eleanor doesn't have to restructure society and end all wars; from her perspective, she only has to be a good person and get along with her friends in order to create paradise. It's all within her power. 

There is one more stage. Once the subject *does* overcome all obstacles, the architect is forced to reset their memories. This is because humans are not made happy by obtaining the things they want; rather it's the *striving itself*  that fulfills them. The architects then loop this process of striving and forgetting for eternity (reminiscent of Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence).

Eleanor realized in the season 1 finale, just before she was told her memory would be erased, that she had overcome every obstacle placed in her way to get to the good place. The four friends were now close enough that they could stop torturing each other. Eleanor's realization that she made it to the good place is Michael's cue to erase her memory. 

One more thing. The lava pits, spikes, and bees that Michael mentions in the office meeting are all part of the standard script for every human, which we saw play out when a lava pit opened up and chaos reined every time Eleanor did something bad. That part happens in every neighborhood. Michael's twist was just to add in the interpersonal obstacles.

Every single second is filled to the brim with *the show*. I find that rather refreshing.

On a side note, I'm confused how I hadn't heard about this show until this week. You think ""the next show from the creator of The Office starring Kristen Bell"" would make some headlines, right?",8,30,False,self,,,,,

I have a feeling, as Eleanor meets everyone for the second time in season 2, that Jason will be given another completely different identity, similar to Michael ""mixing him up"" with Jianyu in season 1. The viewer will know it's Jason and we'll know that Jason will be forced to pretend that he's [whoever]. That's *his* form of torture.",8,18,False,spoiler,,,,,

2. Do we want more Earth-realm flashbacks in Season 2 or do we feel that we know these characters? According to Michael Schur the second season will be from Michael's perspective, so the Earth flashbacks will naturally become less important. http://www.indiewire.com/2017/08/the-good-place-netflix-michael-schur-twist-season-2-1201869241/",9,11,False,spoiler,,,,,
