And bear in mind this is just my theory.




What if Janet is, unbeknownst to everyone else, actually God? No matter what, she treats everyone fairly, is always nice, and knows/can do anything. 

Bad Janet is the other side of that coin for people who see God as always doing horrible things or not really caring what happens to people.

Her love for Jason is...okay, I don't have a good explanation for that one.

But Janet being a constant source of support for the gang also fits into my previous theory: The core cast is actually in Purgatory. Basically, they weren't saints, but they weren't demons, either. And each one repeatedly demonstrates a desire to do the right thing, which means they shouldn't belong in the Bad Place.",10,42,False,spoiler,,,,,
