4,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2017-2-2,2017,2,2,5,5rhv83,self.TheGoodPlace,[Spoilers] Theory: the middle place,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/5rhv83/spoilers_theory_the_middle_place/,cloglandguy,1485979834,"Eleanor repeatedly feels like she should bein the Middle Place, and asks why there isn't a middle place. I always thought there not being a middle place sounded just... not right.

My theory is (from episode 1 forward, and I feel it still works after the big twist) is that she and the rest of the group actually are in the middle place. A place for people that aren't really bad and aren't really good.

A place for people to prove themselves, and earn their spot in the good place.

In the season finale it's revealed that everybody is supposedly in the bad place, however, that doesn't quite add up to me... let's look at what we know about everyone's lives:

--

Eleanor: kind of a jerk, but not all that bad compared to 'really' bad people, people that lie and murder and cheat - or corporate jerks that get rich off other people's backs. Sure, she was a jerk, but as she mentions once to one of her boyfriends, she just feels there's too much bad stuff in the world - so much that it basically paralyzes and she gives up on trying. It's certainly not good, but not truly bad either. Besides, she was presumably fun and probably gave a lot of people a fun time.

Chidi: he made life hard for the ones he loved. That's pretty much it. I mean, it's a bummer, sure, but it's not like he forced those people to deal with his insecurities. They chose to accept him even with his insecurities. That's not on him, at all. He can't take responsibility for other's choices. Besides that, he spent his life teaching ethics to people, which undoubtedly impacted a lot of lives and must have had a very positive ripple effect. I feel like his goods far outstrip his bads, and him being in the bad place makes no sense.

Tahani: she, like Chidi, was insecure. But come on, raising billions for various charities must have saved and improved hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives. Yes, her motives weren't right, but that's outweighed by her contribution to not just the people in her life, but to people all over the world

Jianyu: I feel like he's closest to actually being in the bad place. He's really kind of a jerk. I think part of it might be that he's actually so dumb he's mentally like a child, and he's not truly bad, in his soul, but he was in the wrong crowd, and they made him bad. Still, he's the most confusing of the group

--

So, I feel like none of them are truly bad, and all of them have potential to be redeemed. I think this is basically what the middle place is: a place for them to improve their flaws and realize their true self, and earn their place in the good place. This middle place may 'loop' as many times as it needs to for the inhabitants to realize their potential.

As far as the soulmates go, I believe they really are. They are actually sort of mirrors of each other and have each others flaws and strenghts.

Eleanor - Chidi: Eleanor has a sense of morality, but doesn't know how to apply it and because of this she just clocks out and ends up a jerk. However, she does know how to just let go and live life. Eleanor needs Chidi to teach her ethics so she realized that it's not useless, and that there is a point to being good. Chidi needs Eleanor to teach him that you can't live only in books and theory, and sometimes you need to say 'fuck it' and live in the moment and live life, for you and for the ones you love.

They're perfectly suited to learn from each other and overcome their flaws.

Tahani - Jianyu: Tahani is super insecure. She constantly feels like she's not good enough. She just wants someone to love her and appreciate her for who she is. She ends up in this endless loop of trying to please people who cannot be pleased and ends up doing a lot of good for the world, but she's unhappy herself. Jianyu doesn't think of anybody BUT himself. He just does what he wants, when he wants. And actually, he's fine with that, he doesn't feel guilty about that, and doesn't care about pleasing anyone.

Jianyu is the perfect person to teach Tahani how to just do her, and be proud of who she is without needing outside approval. Tahani in turn can teach Jianyu the value of doing good for others.

--

So to sum it up, my theory is that the four of them are in the Middle Place, 'stuck' in a loop to earn their place in the Good Place by personal growth. Once they get there, they will have also grown into being each others soulmates.",13,21,False,spoiler,,,,,

Both characters serve as a foil for the other.  At first, Eleanor was feigning politeness to Tahani.  Then it became genuine when Eleanor comforted a crying Tahani.  

Their friendship hit a bump in the road when Eleanor revealed herself.  Tahani was at first shocked and felt betrayed.  But she did make an effort to stick up for Eleanor.  

Then Tahani found out Jason's secret, and both ended up confessing feelings to Chidi at the same time.  Tahani was justifiably upset at Eleanor because she knew Jason had been deceiving her, and felt threatened a love rival.  Eleanor deescalated the situation.  Rather than making each other feel horrible, Eleanor decided to make each other feel better.  Saying ""We have a weird, forked up friendship, but it's ours and I care about it"".  (paraphrased)  Tahani was able to get her senses back together and thanked Eleanor for [being such a good friend](https://i.redd.it/n4wwkh0z85cy.jpg).

As we saw in flashbacks in Tahani's life she may have lead a glamorous lifestyle, but it was lonely.  This is probably the first time in her existence that someone acted like a true friend to her.  Every other friendship or relationship Tahani claimed to have was most likely very shallow.  

As I saw their friendship grow something else came to mind.  Eleanor and Tahani aren't that different.  While the circumstances weren't the same, both had neglectful parents.  This influenced them and set them on a course they followed until they died.  One difference is that Eleanor separated herself from her parents while Tahani tried to earn her parents approval.

Hardly groundbreaking and my time is too finite to sit through formulaic sitcoms, so I left.

I think she's dreaming or in a coma.

First, there is no reason to assume she is dead because the only person who ever said it was Michael and he is now proven to be a faulty narrator. Eleanor had conveniently forgotten how she died. (Michael claimed her memory was erased.) And even when we see the shopping cart scene, we don't see her die. Besides, unreliable narrator Michael said ""real"" Eleanor (Vicki) tried to save her. We KNOW that is a lie now.

So if Eleanor is not dead, what's up? Hard to say given that we don't know everything, but maybe Schur's end game could be something like:
1) Chidi is a professor in a Learning Annex kind of place and she took his course and has fallen asleep.

2) She was reading No Exit and fell asleep.

3) She was reading What We Owe to Each Other (a book Chidi taught from AND the book from where Eleanor ripped paper to write the note to herself) and fell asleep.

4) She actually was hit by the shopping carts and is in a coma. Lots of showrunners using coma fantasies these days (The British Life on Mars, upcoming season of Archer).

Finally, an observation. The only death was HAVE seen is Chidi's (hit by a/c). We HEARD about Jason's death, but didn't see it. Tahani we know nothing about. And Eleanor, as I've said, I don't believe is dead.",11,16,False,spoiler,,,,,
