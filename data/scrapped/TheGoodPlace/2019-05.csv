Shawn was right about Doug Forcett, even though he seemed to be speculating. Most likely he's just high enough into management to know that no one has made it to the Good Place in a while.

But this seems like he's about to talk about something that *had* occurred. And possibly even something that Michael also knew.

My thinking is that he was pretty sure Michael would be softened by spending time around the humans. Such concerns might have reached Michael through office gossip. (Though a less out there idea is that he just knew they were beyond version 2.)

However, he doesnt make much sense as a Demon or even a Demon gone good.

For one, the only thing that makes Demons happy is torture. The only thing that makes Angels happy is being kind.
Michael enjoys torture, but not as much as the other demons. He seems to have more nuanced motivations, like we do.

In fact, Michael has a terrible sense of humor (and is insulted by Bad Place jokes and insults), unlike the other demons, and completely missed the point of Trevors Dick Tracy joke. In a sense, he had to be thought how to be bad by Eleanor.

Michaels information about demons is inconsistent. He says he sees in 10 dimensions, when he only uses the three. He says his birthyear is 0000, when he says that when he uses the term millenial, it means theyve only tortured for 1000 years, which doesnt make sense if they only exist to torture.

Michael said that the term demon was insulting and inaccurate - as it is to humans.

When Michael said the four humans were the first interdimensional fugitives, he might have been lying so the humans wouldnt know he was human and the first interdimensional fugitive.

Or, he outsmarted or bribed one of the demons in his Bad Place neighborhood and managed to get free.

Either way, he tricked someone into giving him a job in torture, and climbed the ladder to architect. Its likely Sean knows hes human and pretends not to. Its possible that retirement is impossible to do to humans, which is why Michael was not retired.

In fact, (other than the speculation on how he became an architect) this is only some of the evidence. When I was looking for quotes for this, I actually found a few subtle hints in favor of this theory.

What do you think of this theory?",21,67,False,self,,,,,

Then a few minutes later they're talking about canon jokes that got cut for time, and Lizzy points out a joke that got cut that was ""really important to the plot"". The joke was that Eleanor called Tahani a butthead to her face, and Tahani's head turned into a butt.

(r/thanosdidnothingwrong)

&amp;#x200B;

In Thanos, the film gave us a complex and contemplative villain attempting to solve the trolley problem on a cosmic scale. In a universe hurtling towards certain extinction, he offers correction by trading lives for the continued survival of the spared. He sees the forest for the trees. He kills for the greater good, albeit his own twisted version of what that means. Thanos represents utilitarianism taken to its logical extreme. He sees no quandary in the trolley problem. He chooses to switch tracks every time. In the face of apocalyptic overpopulation, he proposes a grand and audacious culling and calls it salvation.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter The Avengers.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon realising that Wanda could singlehandedly prevent the impending onslaught by destroying the Mind Stone that resides in his forehead (and killing him by extension), Vision argues, Thanos threatens half the universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him. Steve Rogers, a man with unquestioning morality, and perhaps the personification of Kantian deontology, retorts but it should. These diametrically opposed ideas form the push and pull that inform the entire film.

&amp;#x200B;

The juxtaposition of Thanos utilitarianism with the deontology of our heroes is exemplified by the doomed romances of both Gamora and Peter, and Vision and Wanda. It is by no mistake or convenience that the fate of these two relationships mirror each other, as it works in service to contrast the choices made by The Avengers with that of Thanos.

&amp;#x200B;

Peter and Wanda were forced into the unimaginable position of having to make a decision between switching tracks to kill the person they love most in order to save trillions, or doing nothing and watching Thanos wipe out half the universe. In avoiding killing their loved one and waiting too long, they wound up saving neither. Had Peter killed Gamora long before the Guardians confronted Thanos on Knowhere; had Wanda killed Vision before Thanos arrived in Wakanda, there would be no snap to speak of. Thanos, meanwhile, showed grief but no hesitation in switching tracks and choosing to sacrifice his daughter in order to obtain the soul stone and what in his mind would be saving trillions of lives.

&amp;#x200B;

This idea is echoed throughout the film. Characters were constantly forced into similar moral dilemmas and made choices that all but guaranteed the snap. Lokis resistance to letting Thor die, hands Thanos the Space Stone. Gamoras reluctance to see Nebula suffer, gives away the location of the Soul Stone. Dr Stranges refusal to let Tony Stark die at the hands of Thanos, loses the Time Stone. In choosing not to switch tracks to end one life, they doomed half the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

The film presents two paths  both equally unappealing. Killing one to save many undermines the value of life and leads you down the path of Thanos. Yet sparing one leads to the death of many just the same.

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to Endgame.

&amp;#x200B;

As the film reaches its climax, Tony, knowing full well that using the gauntlet will kill him, seizes an opening. He swipes the Infinity Stones off of Thanos gauntlet, and transfers them onto his own. He snaps his fingers, dusting Thanos and his army; he makes the sacrifice play. In all 14, 000, 605 possible futures, the only scenario in which they prevail is predicated on one character solving the trolley problem.

&amp;#x200B;

In the immortal words of The Architect:

&gt;The trolley problem forces you to choose between two versions of letting other people die, and the actual solution is very simple  sacrifice yourself",237,1257,False,spoiler,,,,,

We also learn that the values in the points system is determined by accountants who assign a point value to an action, and then anyone who performs that action in the future is given or loses that many points. The points system appears to be a form of [Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism) [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism). 

From the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://www.iep.utm.edu/util-a-r/): ""Utilitarians believe that the purpose of morality is to make life better by increasing the amount of good things (such as pleasure and happiness) in the world and decreasing the amount of bad things (such as pain and unhappiness)...Act utilitarians believe that whenever we are deciding what to do, we should perform the action that will create the greatest net utility. In their view, the principle of utilitydo whatever will produce the best overall resultsshould be applied on a case by case basis...Rule utilitarians adopt a two part view that stresses the importance of moral rules. According to rule utilitarians, a) a specific action is morally justified if it conforms to a justified moral rule; and b) a moral rule is justified if its inclusion into our moral code would create more utility than other possible rules (or no rule at all).""

I infer that the accountants assign a points value according to the value of the act, but then apply that value as a rule. The show doesn't provide any clarification on that matter that I can see, and it's possible that the accountants are predicting the value of that act into the future. If they're anticipating future value, it's odd that Og received 10,000 for giving a rock -- it seems like repeated gifts of a rock would thereafter get anyone in to the Good Place. 

I will digress for a moment to point out that the show has taken pains to establish that there is a huge exception to this Rule Utilitarian system. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism -- that is, the goodness of an action is determined by its positive consequences. Put another way, an act that maximizes positive consequences is a good act. In the Good Place, however, a positive action does not receive credit if the actor is certain that the Good Place exists. This exception is stated by Janet (and apparently acknowledged by Michael) in *Jeremy Bearimy* (S3E5) and referenced by the Judge in *Somewhere Else* (S2E12) when she says ""You're supposed to do good things because you're good, not because you're seeking moral dessert."" The fact that there's this exception to Rule Utilitarianism seems extremely inconsistent to me in a show that works so hard to explain and be consistent with difference ethical systems. It's a narrative crutch -- you have to present a reason why humans can't know that there's a Good Place, and the reason is ""because then they'll be good for the reward."" However, the entire basis for the universe's ethical judgment is otherwise not on intention, but consequences.

After visiting the accountants' office, Michael decides that the Bad Place must be hacking the points system, and goes to the Good Place to alert the Committee. In the next episode, *Book of Dougs* (S3E11), we finally get our first look into the actual Good Place, or at least its mail room. We meet the Committee, who are (appropriately for rule utilitarians) obsessed with obeying the proper rules and procedure. They totally qualify as [Lawful Stupid](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid) -- and there's even an entry for The Good Place on that page. Kellen is made to resign for failing to follow the procedure for a ""Hear! Hear!"". The Committee determines that they will establish a panel to investigate the points system, but it will take many, many, many years. Michael is upset about the length of time it will take -- the same Michael who in the last episode of season 2 (*Somewhere Else*) was willing to put the humans in their own medium places for up to a million years -- is now concerned about the human timescale. The odd thing about this to me is that on the Jeremy Bearimy timeline, the passage of time on Earth may or may not be relevant. 

Frustrated with the Committee, Michael takes another look at the Book of Dougs, and determines that the reason no one has reached the Good Place in 521 years is ""unintended consequences."" Apparently, due to the interconnectedness of the world for the past 521 years, no one can get enough points without receiving point deductions to make it to the Good Place. So, Mr. Rogers -- the Bad Place. Oskar Schindler -- the Bad Place. Small tribes or isolated groups -- doesn't matter, still the Bad Place. All babies and children who died of accident or illness -- the Bad Place. This is an extremely dark revelation for a show which is a comedy. The writers appear, from the show itself and the podcast, to consider the ramifications of what they reveal, and yet this is not addressed at all. There's a general outcry that more people should be reaching the Good Place, but Michael and the Soul Squad don't seem to care that people who are truly innocent are dying and condemned to an eternity of torture. The Judge doesn't care. The Lawful Stupid Committee doesn't care. Instead, this revelation is used to get the Judge to go to Earth and complain about Chik-Fil-A. And then, she decides that the world is complicated and maybe the system is wrong. 

As an aside, sometime during the Soul Squad's discovery of the system used to judge all humanity, it seems like Chidi, at least, should have realized that this is a Rule Utilitarianism run amok. Chidi mentions multiple times that he focuses on deontology and Kant. He appears to be some variety of Kantian ethicist. The revelation that the universe has One True Ethics (Rule Utilitarianism) and that his are wrong should have some sort of impact on him. It would be like a Christian reaching the afterlife and learning that Zoroastrianism was the correct faith. Chidi, who admittedly seems to be changed somewhat by his burgeoning relationship with Eleanor, doesn't even mention the fact that the system he studied his entire life and based his life on is Wrong with a capital W.

The ""unintended consequences"" revelation has almost ruined the show for me. It seems like pandering to the audience. It's consoling them that ""yes, life is hard in a way that it's never been hard before in history."" It's hazardous, at best, to make presumptions as to the direction the show will take, but Season 4 has been set up to show the Judge how humans could be Good when those unintended consequences are removed, and things like racism, sexism, prejudice, exploitation, etc. don't exist. If that's the case, the show is going to lose its relevance to ""real life"" because we live in that complicated, broken world, and I don't think anyone who's alive to watch the show is ever going to see anything different.

Unintended consequences are, nonetheless, concededly consistent with a Rule Utilitarian view. Intentions are irrelevant -- only results matter. The fact that you lose points for purchasing a tomato that was picked with exploited or enslaved laborers and transported 1000 miles (even if you're unaware of those facts) so that you could get it $.50 cheaper is in line with a utilitarian viewpoint. And then there's Mindy St. Claire -- the woman who, despite the fact that she only *intended* to open a charity with her life savings, nonetheless got credit for all the good it ultimately did. I have no idea how to explain that. 

The argument could be made that:
1. The Good Place is just a TV show.
2. The Rule of Funny and entertainment value trump deep logic and reason.
3. Explaining why dead kids go to hell doesn't have a place on a prime time family comedy series.
4. I should really just relax. 

I have no real refutation of that argument. In some sense, this is nitpicking a show that wants to entertain and raise ethical issues. It has been tremendously successful, in my opinion, at both. There is the danger, however, that people will take its arguments too far. I read several articles and comments around the time the Book of Dougs aired discussing how the episode captured our time or the current political environment. I think the episode only does that if you have a limited understanding of the ramifications and corollaries of the episode.

I will say I have hope for the future of the show. I think that ultimately the show will return to the idea that humans should be judged on their intentions. In *Best Self* (S2E9), Eleanor says to Michael, ""At least you tried to find a way to the Good Place, and that's the greatest thing someone can do."" On one of the podcast episodes, in response to Mark Evan Jackson's ""What is good?"", Mike Schur has said that trying to be good is good. My guess is that the show is actually against utilitarianism, and will result in a points system that gives credit to intentions. In the meantime, though, I found the end of the 3rd season to be very disappointing from a logical standpoint. Entertaining and funny without question, but it lost some of its status for me as a show that considers its own logic and continuity important. Now, somebody needs to nitpick me.",7,12,False,self,,,,,

That's why, I think, both the audience and the characters were relatively undisturbed by the fact that most of humanity was being tortured in the Bad Place. 

By the end of Season 1, though, we learn that all four of the main characters are in the Bad Place. While there is plenty of evidence that they are not saints, none of them seem to deserve eternal torture. AND THEN Season 3 came along, and revealed that everyone in the last five hundred years is being tortured, because apparently no one is good enough to get into the Good Place. So clearly something went wrong here. 

We generally accept that bad people deserve to be punished. But let's hold on for a moment and analyze the ethics of punishing bad people, and the reason for the Bad Place to exist. What if the very existence of a ""Bad Place"" was unethical?

&amp;#x200B;

First, from a consequentialist point of view: 

There are three primary reasons we as a society punish criminals: 

1. To separate them from regular citizens so they can't continue harming people. We isolate criminals in jails in part to put an end to their current crime sprees. A murderer can't kill any more innocent people if they're locked up in jail. 
2. To deter future crime. By punishing contemporary criminals, we tell potential criminals that there are consequences to crimes. Most potential criminals are then deterred from committing any crimes to begin with, creating a safer society. 
3. To reform the criminal so they can rejoin society. 

As aligning with the central tenet of consequentialism, all three reasons are for the sake of benefiting actual people. I would actually argue that, apart from the three listed above, there are no moral reasons to punish evildoers. Since punishing an evildoer brings more suffering into the world (the criminal's pain), the good of the punishment must outweigh the evil in order for the punishment to be just--it thus must accomplish at least some of the three reasons listed above. Simply punishing an evildoer for the sake of punishing an evildoer is not sufficient moral justification for harming another, even if it feels right. 

Now, the Bad Place exists solely to punish evildoers. So let's see how well it meets each of these goals: 

1. To separate them from regular citizens: the ""evildoers"" are already dead, so they'll be separated from the living no matter what's happening to them in the afterlife. 
2. To deter future crime: because no one in the living world is supposed to know how the system works, the Bad Place does absolutely nothing to deter future evildoing. 
3. To reform the criminal: the Bad Place simply does not do this. Up until Michael's experiment, humans in the Bad Place were simply physically and psychologically tortured; post-death moral improvement, in fact, was completely unprecedented. 

In other words, then, the existence of the Bad Place brings zero good into the world. Apart from torturing people for the sake of it, there seems to be no reason for the Bad Place to exist. Now, one might argue that there is some deeper cosmic reason for demons to torture humans--however, we've seen none of it. All I'm seeing, then, is that from a consequentialist point of view, the very existence of the Bad Place is unethical--because, until the Soul Squad came along, nothing good comes out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

From a deontologist point of view: 

I have to admit that I'm not very familiar with deontology, so I could be completely off-base here. But I think a deontologist would actually find the Bad Place system even more unethical than a consequentialist would. For a deontologist, ethics is governed by rules, or categorical imperatives: absolute requirements that must be obeyed in all circumstances and are ends in themselves. Furthermore, deontologists must act as if their every moral decision were to enter a ""kingdom of ends"" and become a moral law. So a deontologist would naturally object to the torture of human beings--if one demon tortures a dickwad, the demon essentially says that torture is permissible in any situation. If torture is wrong, it is always wrong, even if it's in the universe-sanctioned Bad Place. 

Now let's go back to the three reasons for punishment listed above. A deontologist would probably only absolutely agree with the third reason as a valid reason to punish somebody. Another important tenet in deontology is that it is wrong to use people as a means for something: because all humans are rational beings, they must be treated as ends themselves. In other words, you cannot use someone as a pawn to accomplish a goal; their wellbeing should be your goal instead. Punishing criminals to deter future crime, by deontological standards, is then unethical, because you would be using the criminal as a mean to your goal. One could also argue that isolating criminals for the sake of regular citizens is also unethical, because you're still using the criminal for the sake of the citizens instead of respecting their existence as a rational agent. 

The only ethical reason to punish a evildoer, then, is the third: to reform them so they can rejoin society. This is the only reasoning behind punishment where the criminal is treated as an end instead of a means. 

&amp;#x200B;

And this reformative punishment idea is actually where I think the show is headed. Two major themes in The Good Place are redemption and the fundamental goodness of humanity. While Eleanor is a scumbag early in Season 1, the rest of the season goes to show that, with friendship and community, Eleanor is capable of becoming a better person. The same pattern is repeated with the other characters: Chidi becomes more decisive (near the end of Season 3), Tahani reconciles with her sister, and Michael goes from ruthlessly torturing the Soul Squad to joining them in sympathy and goodness. Almost every human (and one demon) is shown to be capable of redemption. Season 4, meanwhile, is poised to start with a new neighborhood experiment with four new characters. The cast and the Judge will see if they can get these four humans to improve as well, essentially testing the human goodness the show has previously emphasized. 

So here is my prediction for the future direction of the show: whether the experiment succeeds or not, eventually the Judge (or whoever else is in charge) will realize that humans can change for the better. Given the show's positive view of deontology, the main characters will probably then convince the Judge that punishment's true purpose should not be mere suffering, but the reformation of the evildoer. Somehow, the afterlife system will be overhauled to replace the traditional Bad Place torture with more of Michael's neighborhoods--positive, nurturing environments where people can improve themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[an interesting sidenote: Kant's Formula of Autonomy says that people have to obey the categorical imperative because they are rational agents. Since Michael, a perfectly average demon, was able to reform into a good person, it seems that the demons are also rational agents, just like humans. So why aren't the demons subject to the categorical imperative? Why aren't the demons also obligated to do good things like humans are? One could argue that it is their nature to be evil, but Michael's character development shows that they clearly have free will. Wonder how that's going to play out in the future.\]",4,14,False,spoiler,,,,,

As per the title, I only started watching this show last Sunday with the intention of enjoying it over a longer period, but once I started watching, I couldn't stop. I have watched the entirety of S3 today!

This has quickly become one of my favourite shows. It's so charming, and hilarious, and... well it's just great.

I love the constant references to incidents or moments from previous episodes or seasons without them butchering the script by explaining why what they are saying is a callback like some shows might do. It just trusts us to get the references. 

It's also a rare show in that there isn't one character I don't enjoy. Chidi and Janet are my favourites but everyone is great. I love the way Janet has involved and she's just so funny, and Chidi is just adorable. Cracks me up whenever he delivers a surprised 'WHAT!?'. Jason is such a moron but it's impossible not to warm to him, Tahani is a bragger but just lovely and Michael is brilliant too. And, of course Eleanor who is just a legit snack and I've really enjoyed seeing her journey of becoming a better person. Even all the recurring characters like Trevor, The Judge, Shawn, Derek and Todd the... lava guy? are all just on point, too.

Genuinely not one thing about this show that I dislike.

Well other than the fact they keep getting reset and the end of S3 was a heartbreaker with Chidi having to have his memory wiped.

That also brings me to another thing I admire about this show. They could so easily do the old trope of characters remembering each other even though they have had their memories wiped because their bond is so strong from sharing at least 800 versions of life/death/whatever that they 'just remember', but so far they haven't done that. 

Perhaps the weakest part of the show, and I say that in a way of not even disliking it, just perhaps if you're determined to find fault, is that maybe the way Chidi and Eleanor got together in S3 perhaps felt a slight bit forced in that it seemed to come from nowhere from Chidi's side.

Also, I find it really sad that they keep getting their memories wiped. To die and find each other in the afterlife is nice even though it turns out they are in the bad place. But then, at the end of S1 they get reset, so it's almost like we might as well disregard S1 as S2 starts with them really being who they were right at the start of S1. And then when they get sent back to Earth it's like great they are alive again, but yet again that's just sad because now everything they shared before in the afterlife means nothing to who they now are again. But like I say, that's not a dislike as such, and it speaks volumes to how great this show is that that all still feels fine, somehow.

Anyway, can't wait for S4. It should be cool, dope, fresh and smart brained.",7,64,False,spoiler,,,,,

The show argues that due to the unknown consequences of actions in our society, being a good person has become difficult and that people are on average actually better than they are credited for by the point system. 

Although I agree with this premise, the underlying issue with this shift of standards appealed for by Micheal implies the allowing of the bad practices of corporations and individuals in our world. To elaborate- think about the current state of the earth and how humans are affecting climate change and mass extinction. If we give in to the argument that the blame falls solely on the producers and individuals are helpless in this situation, we are taking away an important factor from the equation. If a man obtains negative points for an action such as offering his grandma a rose because of his contribution to the mistreatment of migrant workers it follows logically that he has caused a negative impact to the world despite his well-intentioned actions. Should the negative outcome he has supported be dismissed as ignorance or should he be held accountable for this action? Obviously, that is a difficult answer to formulate and I acknowledge Chidi's point in that analysing each of your choices might be impractical but that still doesnt excuse the fact that the world is in peril and it is no one's but our own collective fault. 

(The following paragraph is completely just me completely flexing my ethical superiority and I can remove it but I decided to leave it to prevent personal attacks and also invite suggestions, so you can choose to skip it)
Speaking from personal experience this show has made me reconsider a lot of things I took for granted and this revelation in conjunction to the beginning of my adult life apart from my parents has allowed me to make changes I think are reducing my negative impact in the world. For example, I follow a vegan lifestyle, try my best to shop local/from farmers markets, offset my carbon footprint by having an organisation plant trees on my behalf, and tend to at least skim through the practices of the brands I support. But I am certain that I am inadvertently causing some evil to be put out in this world. I am certainly not a humanitarian and I don't have the resources to bring actual good into this world yet but I am still trying to limit my negative actions until I can create positive impact on the world.

In my opinion, the main motivation behind the actions that might be considered unethical is probably entirely based on economics. The migrant worker working at a blueberry facility is only hired so that they may be underpayed and overworked, so that the price of the end product (blueberries) remains competitive in the market. We all know the products at Farmer's markets are expensive so these low prices and the scarcity in our pockets make us support these large money hungry corporations that help us save money even though they might be taking unethical approaches to achieve said competitive prices. So then why would it be incorrect to recognise this as a choice that the consumer has made? If we strive towards total moral cleanliness how can we absolve the unforeseen negative consequences of our actions? Very seldom is it arguable that the product has no practical alternatives which then needs to be considered on a case by case basis but otherwise in most circumstances the consumers have a choice and more often than not we are motivated by price because that is all the information that is available to us and in this society this might unintentionally create negative consequences but we cannot simply deny responsibilty for these on the basis of ignorance and lack of transparency.

We are all bad people! Just because everyone around us is hurting the world by polluting the environment and supporting mistreatment of people doesn't excuse us to do the same, it does not normalise the action because in absolute terms we are still doing bad things. I recognise the privillege in that not everyone has the option to pay the extra whatever premium to get better more ethically sourced food and other necessities, but if the average person decided to sacrifice a little bit of whatever can be sacrificed, they should make the effort to curb these corporations because like it or not, the reason these inhumane practices exist is because of us, falling for the mask these corporations throw over our eyes, keeping the consumer in the dark about their practices and make their sale solely through their low prices. We as consumers need to be more aware of the manufacturing of the products we support and keep ourselves educated in that matter. 

The practicality of living like Chidi might be debatable but we need to set our intentions into motion, by limiting our involvement in bad farming practices, unnecessary fossil fuel usage and take the necessary first step to becomng a sustainable society, while contintuing to invite regulations for corporations that will allow making this choice easier (from requiring free range egg cartons to state how free their chickens really are to pushing for cleaner energy even if it is not the economical choice right now). We NEED to push for improvments in the transparency of our producers to help us make the choice on metrics other than price. But until that is the norm we still need to- as much as possible- educate ourselves about the implications of our actions as individuals and give these corporation a reason to be transparent- to buy OUR consumption, to force them to sell their products to us through something not as cut and dry as pricing. 
There is no way to simplify the complications of our choices that we make in this world that we have created for ourselves but we cannot simply ignore the complications and pretend it is simplified.",0,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

The whole afterlife and sorta religious premise of the Good Place was really intriguing to me and I was kinda disappointed that werent a lot of shows with that similar premise until I discovered Preacher.

If you dont know about Preacher, its based on a comic series by DC in the 90s about a former bad guy turned gospel preachin Texan named Jesse Custer who becomes possessed by the spawn of an angel and demon and gains the ability to command people with something called Gods Voice. Hes best friends with a hundred year old Irish vampire named Cassidy and has an on again off again badass gf names Tulip. Hes also hunted by an immortal cowboy whos unkillable and can down entire armies so its an interesting story.

The show is honestly amazing, its hilarious although really witty and sarcastic in its delivery.

The humans in the neighborhood are imprisoned insofar as they cannot get out and are forced to interact with a finite set of people everyday. It's hard to understand how everybody wouldn't get on everybody else's nerves after a few thousand years. Anyway, in this closed system, Michael has the humans behave in their usual (i.e. selfish, self-centered) ways, just like they did on Earth in an open system, where their selfishness was lost in the mass and offset by the general process of society. This is their rational behavior, and it should have been so in the neighborhood too; for instance, Chidi should rationally have given Eleanor in, to preserve his self-interest and avoid any stomachaches.

This situation is analogous to the Prisoner's Dilemma, where two prisoners are given a choice to either cooperate with their accomplice, or rationally betray them to preserve themselves.

But then, something happens in the neighborhood: the humans cooperate. When the Prisoner's Dilemma was tested, a bias towards cooperation was discovered.

""It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better individual reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a systemic biastowards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of ""rational"" self-interested action.""

So our beloved Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani and Jason couldn't help but cooperate. Michael's mistake was relying too much on human selfishness and rationality, when human relationships depend on a large part on emotions. And humans are social animals: our morality is mostly based on the fact that we feel emotions &lt;i&gt;for each other&lt;\i&gt;.",5,44,False,self,,,,,

and then my girlfriend introduced me to this show (which she found by accident a couple of weeks before). Since the show came out almost three years ago and is only availeable in Germany on a quite obscure streaming platform ""maxdome"" (think Netflix, but way smaller and mostly really shitty shows and movies) it kinda feels like a sign that i watched it now.

There are about 7.7 billion people alive right now, so about 100.3 billion people have died and been sorted. Of those, 22 billion certainly went to the bad place as they were born after the moment when everyone started going to the bad place. That leaves 78.3 billion people sorted prior to 1650. If 30 billion are being tortured and 22 are recent, then a mere 8 billion humans were sent to the bad place prior to 1650/1500. 

8 billion people out of 78.3 billion is about 10.2%. All numbers are obviously fuzzy since I'm working with 1650 numbers and those numbers are estimates since there was no census anyway...

The finale was so emotional and ambitious, and it really cemented my love for this show. 

However, as much as this show has inspired me to study philosophy and ethnics, I am still very much a newby in this regard. I understand that Chidi's memory must be erased, and Eleanor's will not. Does this create any ethical quarries they must navigate moving forward? It seems that both of them (understandably) want to be together again. However, we are now dealing with no only an imbalance of power, as she will be in a sort of authority position over him (her words were a sexy god-like figure), but also an imbalance of knowledge. She will know him intimately, his desires, his hang-ups, how to help him, what makes him tick, etc, and it will be really hard for someone devastated by the love of their life not remembering them to not use that information even subconsciously to get closer to him. She'll be drawn to him and have a wealth of information about him that we won't even realize she has. Also, given that she can't disclose it to him, any relationship they develop will be built on or around deception.  I don't envy the position she is in.

In short, I totally ship these two characters, and that montage of their time together was soul crushing in a beautiful way. But wouldn't any relationship they have in the future be riddled with ethical concerns?",3,13,False,spoiler,,,,,
