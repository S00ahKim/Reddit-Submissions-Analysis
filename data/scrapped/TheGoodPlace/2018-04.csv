For another fandom of mine, I make weekly summaries of all of the fic activity and I figured I should do it for this one too. Things aren't exactly hopping in terms of The Good Place fic, but it's not dead either. Still, monthly seemed better.

The list below is only derived from scanning and combining ArchiveOfOurOwn, FanFiction.net and Wattpad (with the #thegoodplace tag). It's currently only partially curated, so it has a little bit of cruft, but I'm working on that.

I've also prepared a similar listing of [ALL fic in the fandom](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/tgp/all-time.html). There are just over 400 of all kinds.

Anyway, lemme know what you think! =)

This month we saw [five new fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/tgp/2018-03-01.html#new-fic), [three completed fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/tgp/2018-03-01.html#completed-fic), [sixteen new one-shot fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/tgp/2018-03-01.html#one-shot-fic), and [seven updated fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/tgp/2018-03-01.html#updated-fic).

1,TheGoodPlace,t5_3ekfb,2018-4-1,2018,4,1,23,88r8gr,self.TheGoodPlace,The Archetypes of Bad People [Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/88r8gr/the_archetypes_of_bad_people_spoilers/,lxndrdvn,1522593669,"[SPOILERS]

After finishing the first season and having entered the second season of The Good Place I thought about the four archetypes of bad people that are portrayed in the series. I expect someone has had the same realisations.

Eleanor is of course the most obvious one. She would have the capacity to do good but chooses not to. Shes selfish, inconsiderate, and very much aware of it.

Jason is arguably not as bad, since he doesnt have the capacity to be a good person because hes an idiot. Hes not equipped to make the good decisions, even if he wanted to. One begs to question can you really be a bad person if you dont have the skills or smarts to do good?

Tahina is the one that shows going to The Good Place doesnt rely on utilitarian ethics. She had the capacity to do good and she did good deeds, however, she did them for selfish reasons. Even though her deeds made the world a better place, her motivation was selfish, as was discussed in the series as well.

Chidi is possibly the most tragic one. He wanted to do good and had all the knowledge to do so but was crippled by his own anxieties. This proves The Good Place doesnt operate on Kants philosophy either, that the mere want to do good is not enough. He had the capacity to do good, the motivation to do good but his actions - or more accurately, inactions - didnt result in good.

Based on these observations, a person would have to possess the capacity to do good, the motivation to do good, and their decisions should result in good. The Good Place has to be filled with people who are reasonably capable, willing to do good, and fortunate enough that their actions resulted in good things. 

This in turn means that The Bad Place is filled with people who are incompetent, stupid, pretentious, indecisive, and unlucky - along with those who are actually evil. What I find interesting is that you dont have to be evil to end up in the Bad Place - you couldve just lost the genetic lottery or be haunted by insecurities caused by your environment. Is it not then unnecessarily cruel to lump the people who choose to be bad with people who are down on their luck or lacking the right motivation in their good deeds?",46,171,False,spoiler,,,,,

Then I got to the end, and... WHAT. That was great. Top quality ending, and came out of nowhere. I was so wrapped up in the facade that I was completely blindsided.

In the original Orientation video, we learn that ""Only the people with the highest scores"" come to the Good Place. NOT ""all people"" with positive scores.

If we take this at face value, it means that there are untold numbers of people with POSITIVE scores, people who should, therefore, be considered more good than bad, that don't get in.

When I first started watching this show last year, Michael's name totally threw me off. In theological lore, and in the Abrahamic religions tradition, Michael is one of the most well known angels - Holy Michael, the Archangel. So when he was introduced, I quickly accepted that he was either that angel himself, or an angel named after him. His name itself also means ""Who is like God"", and as the architect of the fake Good Place, he really was for all intents and purposes, like a God. 

Turned out that it was quite the red herring when the reveal in season 2 showed that no, Michael was no angel! He was a total demon! It was in part so surprising because Michael, in theological lore, was the right hand of God and led the army of heaven against Lucifer, aka Satan aka the King of Hell himself.

However, it got me thinking more deeply about him, and how it didn't seem to be just simple irony. In The Roman Catholic tradition, Michael plays four roles, and the parallels between theological!Michael and Good Place! Michael are remarkable. 

The first is being the leader of the army of heaven, as mentioned. I didn't find any literary parallels here (yet). 

The second relates to Michael as the angel of death, where he was to carry the souls of the deceased to heaven. Goodplace!Michael, while the architect of the neighborhood, was also the first being the humans meet after their death and to greet them into (what they believed to be) the good place, helping them get settled in, etc. 

The third relates to Michael as the judge, weighing the soul of the deceased as good or bad on a set of balanced scales. Although Michael wasn't the one who designed the points system, he does spend a lot of time talking about it and using it as the basis for moral judgement (""the thief was bad, he stole bread, so that's negative 12 points, and it was a baguette, which makes him French, so that's negative 18 points"" or something like that in the trolley problem ep). 

Finally, and also in Jewish tradition, Michael was also the patron Saint of the Chosen People, serving as their advocate and intermediary, appealing on their behalf against God. GoodPlace!Michael quickly settles into this role towards the end of season 2, where he first appeals for the humans against Shawn, and then subsequently against the Judge.

Vicky was put in a cocoon to be tortured. Eleanor's demon-soulmate ""Chris"" wanted to be a twister, but still joined Michael's experiment, to be a part of something new. What if demons get bored of torturing humans and want to do something else with their lives?

What if the ancient demons just couldn't learn how to torture later generations of humans - humans that had spent 30 years of their life in an iron maiden might shrug off eternity getting poked by a pitchfork.

What if demons realized, in the Dark Ages, that humans were actually pretty good at torturing each other. And some of the evilest humans were given Demon Internships in lieu of being tortured forever. When Michael said some of the demons were Millenials, perhaps he really meant humans from the generation of Millenials.

What if The Good Place is the process for the main cast to learn to set aside human morality and just be a devil? If this truly is Michael's experiment (because can we really trust Michael?), maybe they had another way to corrupt humans before.

The main cast spent their lives unwittingly torturing humans in the real world, before they died. They tortured Michael by not following his plan, and teaching him human ethics, now his soul is forever conflicted. They tortured Janet by murdering her and making a robot (not a robot) fall in love. The other demons, by making them repeat The Good Place over and over. Even Shawn was tortured by being kept from his goo.

Could you imagine these natural tormenters being admitted to The Real Good Place? They'd be happy for like a week, then start nitpicking about small things. Chidi spent 80 minutes picking a hat, even an angel of infinite patience is going to break waiting for him to decide on how many grains of sand he wants on his beach.

But the jewel of this argument - see how easily each of them fit as devils in the bad place museum. Jason gleefully set a fire, Tahani had no problem talking that other devil's ear off. Elenor has repeatedly said to Michael ""We have a lot in common.""

Even Chidi lost his uncertainty when he could finally let go of his crippling doubt and just chose his evillest thought, and punch that other devil in the junk.

But the thing is, we get to the final test, and Eleanor is the only one that passes it. I finally realized: Eleanor wasn't just made better by the others; *she* was the one fixing *them*. To be sure, they all helped each other, but Eleanor was the key to all their 'Final Exams'.

Picture all of their exams in S2, if Eleanor was with them:

1) Jason sits down to the videogame, and Eleanor keeps talking to the Judge. She'll insult Jason for several minutes, but she'll at least hear what the rules are.

2) Tahani sits down with her parents, and Eleanor doesn't let them talk at all before she rips into all of them, calling them worse than her own parents. (She'll rant about how Tahani deserved a family way more than she herself ever did, and realize she's complimenting Tahani again)

3) Chidi is staring at the two hats. Eleanor watches for thirty seconds, rolls her eyes, and tells him which one she likes on him more. Chidi is very grateful. Hot Diggity Dawg!

Now picture how they died. Chidi, standing under an air conditioner for an hour, looking for a bar. Eleanor would have pulled her hip flask and dragged her inside. Tahani, confronting her sister? Eleanor would have taught her how to start a 'dress bitch' scandal and walked out early. Jason... Well, let's be honest, Eleanor would have gotten him to rip off a seafood restaurant, and then eaten her weight in stolen shrimp.

To define the situation: Tahani Al Jamil is in the bad place. All her charity raising doesnt count because she didnt really mean it. The only plausible interpretation is that we have adopted a deontological stance that Acting on the desire for admiration counts as immoral. 


Lets be clear, I feel that it is absolutely outrageous that Tahani has been sent to The Bad Place. I feel strongly that any reasonable formulation of morality (Deontological or Consequentialist) should end up with her in the The Good Place based on what we know about Tahanis life. In this essay I hope to convince you, the reader of this point, and also maybe elucidate some of the Good Places weaker examples of moral philosophy.


**2 	Defining Good**


In order to properly justify why I think Tahani is a good person, let us first define Good or Moral in the context of this essay. In my opinion, the best way to define such terms is their relation to societal welfare/net happiness/etc. (The Consequentialist view)


**2.1	Whats the point of Morality?**


We can view morality from two lenses. In the first, we can say morality is useful because it allows us to make decisions in the world. That is, we can say a moral system is just a decision system, providing justification for actions as we go forward. We can also say morality defines a goal. That is, morality points us towards a better place, and ideal that we can strive for. It is my view that morality should necessarily be both. Using it as only a decision-making tree begs the question: Why be moral? Or even: What is moral? Indeed, judging others is not particularly possible unless a common theme or goal is possible. If the premise of the show, that there are Good and Bad places, and there are good and bad people, is true, it seems that we must accept that there is a universal morality, making necessary a universal goal.


**2.1.1	Why Consequentialism?**


Consequentialism is a system of morality which judges actions by their end results. It is distinct from deontology, which judges the actions themselves by a set of rules. The most common example of Consequentialism is Utilitarianism, which posits that we should judge all actions by their contribution to societal utility, typically measured by overall happiness. Given the tools in the Good Place, Consequentialism is not only superior functionally to Deontology, but is in fact strictly preferable. The strength of Consequentialism is twofold:


1.	The morality of an action is decidable, that is, every action may be judged as moral or immoral


2.	The morality of an action is comparable, that is, every action may be compared to other actions


This means that, given enough data, we can make confident, definite decisions. In addition, those decisions are performed with a definite goal which is shared among other humans. This means that in the most perfect form, Utilitarianism can be a universal morality guide. 


Of course, the problem with utilitarianism has always been the difficulty of judgement. How are we to judge overall utility? Surely most humans must find it very difficult to take the long view of their actions, let alone the actions they might have taken. If only there was an infallible system designed by super beings with Clarke-Magic level technology that could calculate everything for us.


The Good Place judging screen is one of the single most beautiful things I have seen in cinema. Because what it promises is the ultimate solution to moral quandary. It knows what we should do. It neatly circumvents the main problem with all of utilitarianism. It also means that we perfectly fulfill both useful definitions of morality.


(For responses to miscellaneous critiques of Consequentialism, see Appendix A and B.)


**2.1.2	Why NOT Deontology?**


Kants Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals states: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction. Essentially, Kant says that actions can only be taken if one accepts that the action can be taken in any circumstance without exception. As Chidi says: KANT SAYS YOU CAN NEVER LIE as he attempts to not doom all his friends with his very, very, stupid view of morality.
For obvious reasons, this view of morality is incredibly rigid. So rigid, in fact, that it leads to many contradictory, undecidable positions if we take intuitive rules as categorical imperatives. Chidis dilemma gives an obvious example. We made a rule to not lie. But we have another implicit rule: Dont doom your friends to unending torture. In this case, and many others, those rules clash and create undecidable positions.
There are Deontological answers (See appendix C), but, in the end, you have to either allow massive confusion (in the case of ranking rules), moral catastrophes (in the case of following rules to the letter), or collapse into another form of Consequentialism (in the case of soft rules).


Even worse, many decisions are neither moral nor immoral, meaning that the choice to make them is either based on consequentialism (maximizing your happiness) or arbitrary. This means that deontology fails at a basic level to assist in decision making. We have moral actions (rules say so), immoral actions (violate the rules) and a whole other category of actions (irrelevant to our defined rules).  Fundamentally, a system of morality which fails to cover many situations is not as useful as a universal one.


**2.3	Defining how we believe the Good Place Judges people.**


The whole premise of The Good Place is that every sandwich you atehad an effect, that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad. It seems that the system MUST be Utilitarian in nature, how else are you going to judge every action? 


Additionally, the Good Place judges people at some sort of expected value at the time of death. That is, a persons goodness is not merely what they have done, but also what they are likely to do, or accomplish, going forward. This is illustrated best by Mindy St. Clair, who didnt really do most of her good works, but did intend to do them. Similarly it follows intuitively that a 18 year old who had done nothing of note besides being very kind to some old people with the intention to hook them all on drugs would go to the Bad Place.


**3.0	Tahani is clearly a good person**


OK so lets say that we accept Utilitarian morality with an expected value component as our litmus test. If we do, Tahani is clearly a good person. Like its not even a question. Not only is she a good person, she is most likely one of the greatest people in history. Let us begin with why her flaws are not significant:


**3.1	Why intention matters, and why Tahanis intentions are fine**


It seems intuitive to say that intentions matter. Indeed, intentions are a large part of our judgement of other human beings at all times. A persons intentions define them. A man helping a child up with the intention to help is great. A man helping a child up with the intention to lure is awful.


The obvious answer is purity. The reasons intentions matter is because an action must be pure for it to be good. From the Consequentialist viewpoint, such an interpretation is foolish. EX:


Say Jason believes, in a completely pure way, that throwing a Molotov cocktail into someones apartment to stop them from calling the cops on WingSluts for the roaches in their fridge is right. He believes he is helping the world and being the best man he can be.


Did Jason act morally? Of course not, thats stupid. This is a completely immoral action and I dont care what Jason was thinking. So why does the inverse situation seem somehow immoral to us? Well, were just anticipating long term immorality.


I would argue that intentions are important because they signal consistency. If we judge a person by their expected value, then we can see intentions as part of that expected value. That man helping that child up is moral while he does it. That single act in of itself was a good one no matter what. It is the following act which may more than cancel out the good one. 


Therefore, Tahanis actions may at first stink of immorality on an intuitive level. After all, havent we all imagined people who dont actually care about others, and hurt people when they think it wont get back to them? The prom queen, who is desperate for approval from her class, but ruins some nerds life behind the scenes, etc. is a pretty common trope in movies (though honestly not in real life).


The thing is, Tahanis intentions cause consistent actions. Tahani is desperate not only for the approval of others, but approval from within. In her flashbacks, we see that she wishes to become a better person than her sister, by striking of by herself and owning her own accomplishments. This means that Tahani is likely to have continued raising money, with no embezzlement, larceny, or negative impact, for many years. She wants attention yes, but her way of getting attention is to go out and do only good things on an enormous scale.
Also, on a deontological note, wanting peoples approval is immoral is a stupid rule to have anyway. Why is it bad to want people to like you? Sure if you hurt people (including yourself) in pursuit of approval, thats bad, but thats not addressing this specific implied rule. Wanting affection is literally a basic human trait. How are we defining the limit at which liking social recognition somehow becomes this immoral act? Am I immoral because I want the family to get along? Am I sinning when I be a little nicer around my sisters friends? Should we all just be callous, unfeeling, inconsiderate monoliths? Why?


Honestly, this whole situation stinks of a common human psychological process know commonly as mental gymnastics. When confronted with their own weakness, humans are often tempted to degrade the credibility of the weakness. When we see someone, who raises billions for charity while we sit on our fat asses and do nothing, we are often tempted to de-legitimize their effort. Otherwise, wed be forced to confront the fact that we are not acting as morally as we could, and are in fact comparatively lazy, greedy, and self-centered. No, but actually, we are equal, because they didnt mean it enough. I bet she doesnt actually care about the literally tens of thousands of people she is saving, so I dont have to care about the poor and hungry. Actually, I dont have to do shit because I wouldnt mean it. Im just not the type who can do that while being completely pure, so actually I cant really help and dont have to do anything.


**3.2 	The moral weight of Tahanis accomplishments**


First, we must establish that Tahanis accomplishments were mostly due to her own efforts. As we see, she rejects her parents money (see reading of the will) and rejects her sisters reputation (see magazine interview). This means she built her international money-raising operation almost from the ground u; it would not have occurred without her initiative. However, let us grant that perhaps 50% of the money she raised doesnt count because others might have raised it/she doesnt get all the credit for ground work. Though, if she was raising money from rich people who only gave it to show off at her functions, then her contribution is actually quite a bit greater.


Tahani raised USD 60 billion (USD 30 billion directly attributed by our estimate). Raised and put to work, as she doesnt seem to have a foundation which stores it. This is an important distinction, because even 30 billion is an utterly ridiculous amount of money. If we take the rough average of the best few life-saving charities, we find that it costs about USD 5500 to save a life. That is, it costs only USD 5500 to prevent a death that would have occurred had the money not been put to work. This means if we chose to try only to save lives, then Tahani has caused the salvation of around 5.5 MILLION PEOPLE.


Think about that right now. Its honestly a little difficult to comprehend the sheer magnitude of Tahanis impact on the world. Imagine literally every person youve ever met. Every person you passed on the street. Every person you saw out of the corner of your eye in a restaurant. Your first girlfriend, all her friends, and their parents. Every person in your high school, your middle school, your kindergarten, and all the teachers. Imagine them lying in dirt pits, stomachs swollen from internal bleeding. Imagine them shaking in bed, as a perfectly curable disease took them away. Imagine that from birth you had instead walked empty streets and lived in empty buildings, because every single person you ever interacted with died. Now imagine that instead Tahani swooped in and provided the means to save all of them. Well, assuming this is Reddit and youre about 24, thats likely to be about ~24,000 people. Not only has Tahani done that, shes done it like 200,000 times over.  Yet shes somehow a bad person. Thats fucking insane. I know this is fictional, but its probably the biggest goddamn miscarriage of justice Ive ever seen, fictional or not. A literal embodiment of charity condemned to eternal torture because she had some childhood trauma. Worst of all, this point is just kind of glossed over and accepted. Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me???!?!?


The graphic showed one person getting like a fourth of her points from hosting ONE REFUGEE FAMILY (5 people/Syria/3 years) (though honestly the numbers had to be skewed. Ending slavery at 814k is way better than 106.36% of the lifetime income of some person [imputed 860k]). The Good Place: Those people? Fuckem. They could have died. We dont care. Like a Holocaust worth of people, meh. She was kind of snobby and had some childhood issues. 


You can reduce the estimate by five times if you want; Tahani should have more points then almost any other human. Honestly probably one of the top 50 in all of history, let alone during this particular time period. This is ridiculous. I cant even.


**4.0 In Conclusion**


I dont even know why I bothered to write this essay, but I am outraged to the depths of my nerdy core. I hope that I have convinced at least some of you, though my writing in this case was not necessarily as thorough as it could have been. Tahani belongs in the good place. She always belonged in the good place. Also unrelated note, Chidi is a terrible ethics teacher. Who starts someone out with KANT of all people. Terrible.

**Appendix A.  Response to Transplant and other similar Critiques**


A common criticism of Consequestialist theory is that it makes all actions morally permissible under the correct circumstances. In the famous Transplant situation (Shown in S2E5 briefly), we have 5 dying patients who can be saved by the murder of 1 healthy one. The criticism goes: See! Utilitarians will murder the healthy man! That dont seem right!. This merits several responses.


1.	What seems disagreeable is sometimes, nevertheless, what is necessary. Why, fundamentally, should we just assume this critique is valid if we are guaranteed this action leads to a better society? A happier society? A more productive society? With more people alive? 


2.	There seems always to be an implicit, underlying thought if we went around murdering people, that would be bad. Well of course it would be bad. But the fact is, in the vast majority of cases, killing people is bad. No Utilitarian system denies that. Feelz are not realz. 


3.	This is really a restatement of the trolley problem with fancier hoops. The trolley problem, commonly introduced because it causes problems in intuitive deontological thinking. Why is this considered a critique when many deontological systems consider the situation an unsolvable paradox? Are we really bringing on the criticism how DARE you be able to decide what to do in a situation?


4.	The critiques of Utilitarian theory often happen in a fake world while somehow maintaining the sensibilities of the real world. In the real world, murdering a person causes chaos, mistrust, weakens the rule of law, causes emotional impacts, does not guarantee success, etc. etc. etc. As such, a real-world doctor would not murder a healthy patient under a utilitarian mindset. The its unintuitive criticism does not apply if you have to force an unintuitive clear decisions world when you create the scenario. The same cannot be said of critiques of Deontology (Axiom: Tell the truth, Situation: Nazi asking about Anne Frank living in your attic).


**Appendix B  Alienation and Duty Critique**


It is often said that Consequentialism is alienating and overly rigid because it requires an agent to always consider the morality of all actions, rather than just mandating some actions in certain situations.


1.	Why must we consider following a maximal value as categorical when deontology abandons categorical imperatives in most cases. We can simply say instead that our duty is to ensure net positive or moral actions, not the most net positive or most moral actions. Immoral actions are only the ones which cause the world to lose happiness. In this way, we find a state of being that is, if anything, less alienating than attempting to follow a complex set of non-categorical rules mixed with another long list of categorical-but-ranked rules.


2.	Why must we despair at not being perfectly moral? As far as I know, no human being has ever been perfectly moral even by their own deontological standard. We can accept a categorical imperative to do the best, then accept that we all fail it. Still, Consequentialism is useful because we can know how to better ourselves rather than just lazily following rules when they show up.
 
**Appendix C  Common Resolution Deontological solutions to Categorical Imperative**


The Kantian view: Perhaps we deny that moral catastrophes exist and say that it is our moral duty to tell the truth anyway. Consequences we took no direct action to cause merely occur, and our decision is still clear, to remain true to our direct imperative. This is deeply unsatisfying for obvious reasons. Are we just abdicating our responsibility to other people then? Why should we prefer a system of morality which decides to completely ignore common good? So if someone swings from a rope, and I can pull them up, but I dont pull them up, thats morally neutral? Why is that intuitive? Its not even easy. Would you find it easy to tell the truth to Nazis as they hunt for Jewish refugees?


Prima Facie Duties: Perhaps certain duties trump other duties. There is a hierarchy of duties. But how to determine the hierarchy? Does this not simply collapse to consequentialism in most realistic cases? Why, for example, would the duty to the five hundred trump the duty to the one? The only reason we can give is because we want to help more people (in other words: Maximize Benefit to Society).


Threshold Deontology: Perhaps we adhere to deontological rules until a certain threshold, then switch to consequentialist thinking. Honestly this one may make sense in the real world, but still isnt very satisfying. How do we define the switch point? This leads to all kinds of weird situations. If we only torture 1 to save 10000, then shouldnt we just put another persons life in danger if there are only 9999 hostages?

5) It does seem like having so many Bad Place folks spending time on four souls seems kinda... crazy. But I guess if those demons live eternally they have plenty of free time, eh?

All that aside, I definitely enjoyed season 1 and am looking forward to watching season 2 (I guess on nbc.com? Bummer it's not on Netflix).",14,14,False,self,,,,,

Without his influence they would have made it to the good place on their own, no problem. He was there pushing each of them to falter every step of the way. He was there before they died, and he may have even been there before they were born. **How can we know this?** Simple.

We know that a demon can go to Earth and interact with humans. **Michael did that at the end of season 2.** He gave Eleanor the push in the right direction she needed to find Chidi and continue learning to be a good person.

We've seen how Pillboi was there at all of Jason's failures. Who was there when Jason revealed he wasn't really Acid Cat? Pillboi. Who was there when Jason threw a molotov cocktail at Acid Cat's boat? Pillboi. Who was there when Jason attempted to rob the restaurant? Pillboi. 

Sure, Pillboi didn't tell him to do it, but just as Michael gave Eleanor the push she needed to go find Chidi, Pillboi is always there to push Jason to fail. When was Pillboi *not* with Jason? [Jason's Greatest Accomplishment.](https://i.imgur.com/hH7mUIO.png) That's right. **Jason was at his best when Pillboi was not around.**

What then, about the others?

**Tahani:** It goes quick, but if you pause at the right moment, you can see Pillboi [sitting at the table in the bottom right](https://i.imgur.com/hXv93i6.jpg) at her charity auction that her parents described as a public failure (until her sister stepped in to help).

**Eleanor:** A friend of Eleanor's dad [looks awfully familiar in this scene.](https://i.imgur.com/tJTJtKz.jpg) It seems their shared affinity for Hawaiian shirts helped him push his way into her life early on.

**Chidi:** It was hard to find proof that Pillboi manipulated Chidi. I finally found it, though. [There is a scene where Chidi is picking teams during recess.](https://i.imgur.com/1aClgcg.jpg) It seems Officer Pillboi was able to make time to watch.

So there you have it.  An agent of the bad place set on securing souls to torment for eternity? Or a renegade demon working on his own? Hmm...",18,44,False,spoiler,,,,,

And the dream was weirdly realistic, not bonkers like most of my dreams. 

Some highlights I remembered-

They did get to the real Good Place eventually. And it was amazingly opulent and cool.

But that was exactly why it didn't completely satisfy them. Because it was so opulent and perfect for each individual, everyone tended to end up lonely, off on their perfect island. And without a common cause (even if due to a common adversary), there was no sense of unity and intimacy. 

And there was also a fair amount of boredom, in all that placid glitz...

And then they discovered that the real Good Place was really just one among many ""Places"" (shades of Westworld). And it was for those needing a blissful break from their previous lives, more like a vacation spot than anything else. 

.....

So, in conjunction with other dramas and hijinks they daringly escaped to other Places as well, using that fancy elevator.

Two other places I remember-

""The Bipolar Place"" (Yes, really.)

Michael summed this up as ""the roller coaster of the afterlife"".  

One bit I remember was Eleanor getting super excited to understand where it went wrong with her family, then finding a painting she drew of a fish in kindergarten and getting super sad thinking she was to blame for her parents losing motivation in life. 

(When I tell it now it sounds sad, but in the dream it was really funny because of how truly awful the drawing of the fish was, and how funny it was to see Eleanor's crazy leap to self-blame when her parents were obviously so fucked up on their own.)

But yeah, that's the Bipolar Place. 

.....

Once they got some sanity back from their time in The Bipolar Place, in their quest for answers they went to ""The Truth Place"". 

Which I thought made tons of sense as being a Place separate from the Good Place, because the truth has answers, and often relief and liberation, but usually the truth hurts, too. 

One scene I remember:

- Chidi completely tripping out on his expanding levels of awareness of all the deep philosophical truths of the universe, with some consternation at just how overcomplicated he had made it (and also realizing how truly bad his almond milk fetish had been, haha).

- With Tahani sat next to Chidi tripping out on truths about her relationship with her family and all the best truths about fashion and hosting fabulous parties, including some gasps of horror mixed in with the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" as she realized some fashion faux pas she had previously made.

- With Eleanor next to Tahani tripping out on all the real dirt on all the celebrity gossip she read about in her previous life (with periodic celebrity appearances by Tahani in Eleanor's psychedelic truth trip), with Eleanor periodically muttering ""that bitch"" under her breath (not about Tahani).

- Last, Jason, tripping on the truth about all the best times for the bass drop, with an appearance by Chidi realizing how the patterns of a good bass drop come from the deepest principles of the universe, and seeing that Jason was a great philosophical teacher via EDM. (There can be good EDM, right guys?)

.....

My favorite part of the dream was a scene with Michael explaining to Eleanor that there was never a real Bad Place- that just like Janet was stolen from the Good Place, the humans they tortured were stolen from the Good Place, too. Because the people in the real Good Place would want to reform everyone, right? 

So the humans were stolen. The demons were just misfits who liked to torture people, and one of the best tortures was to convince people that they deserved the Bad Place, and that all their heroes deserved the Bad Place, too.

And if that's the case, and there is a good place, all these supposedly good people are completely fine with people suffering? With their loved ones suffering if they don't end up in the good place same as them?

In season 1 it's explained away with the ""good people"" actually being demons, and heck anything Michael says could be a lie (albeit a lie pretty close to the truth)

But at the same time, I feel like the season 2 finale would have been a really satisfying ending to the show if they stopped it there. Assuming that Eleanor and the others were truly sent back to Earth \(which I know some people are debating\), then having Eleanor find Chidi irl would make for the perfect resolution. We know that Chidi will fall for Eleanor and teach her ethics, implying that both of them will be sent to the real Good Place when they die \(as Chidi will decisively choose Eleanor and Eleanor will become a better person\).

I know that the writers probably did this on purpose in case the show didn't get renewed for season 3, but still \- I honestly can't imagine a better ending to the show than this. Interested to see if the actual finale to the show tops it!",6,13,False,spoiler,,,,,
