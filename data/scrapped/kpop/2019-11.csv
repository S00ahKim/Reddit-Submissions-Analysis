I'm not saying I'll get in because you do have to audition and pass, but I just don't understand how students have so much money for outfits and traveling. I know there are fans who get to compete with other people to win a prize (like performing at the World Kpop Dance Final in Seoul), so I'm just wondering how that's possible. I watch videos that groups cover of Kpop songs, and they always wear new outfits. I guess this isn't just for Kpop fans since every group does the same, but I'm leaning more towards Kpop since some fans actually get to go to Korea for free (lucky) and see idols. Most of the students are young too (17-21), but they have the funds for clothing, shoes, traveling, etc. If you're in a group, please let me know what your secret is lol.

There are honestly too many to mention but two off the top of my head right now are:

1. NCT Dream's [Jeno and Jaemin](https://twitter.com/dulcenomin/status/1188618945407926272?s=20) and how Jeno always unconsciously takes care of Jaemin first before himself, out of habit probably, since they've been stuck together (*literally* stuck together, they were revealed to be seatmates even in school) since they were thirteen. 
2. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6Phhfzm__8) behind the scenes clip from BTS Bon Voyage when the guys were pretty much done filming and were doing their own things and Taehyung started crying in a corner, so Jimin held him as he cried. Taehyung actually joined the filming late because his grandfather passed away, which is most likely why he was crying although they never talked about it there. But it was so warm because the second the staff member softly informed Jimin, he literally ran over to Taehyung and you can't see it but you can hear him wrap him in a hug as he says 'My baby...' Those two have a lot of warm moments, but this one is a personal favorite because it was just so raw. 

What are some of your faves?",39,144

But then why  does her malicious comments and rumors has so much power as to ruin  a promising kpop star's  career. why was wonho kicked out? Was this such a big mistake, that he had to part ways with mx? Why ?

This trend of kpop industry is so messed up. I just wanna say that I love you all and will continue to love you even if you  become a little healthy or infact chubby, like why do they have to starve. 
A while ago Suga was ridiculed cause he gained some weight. I loved him even more than before with the extra pounds. Why do they have to go through so much?

Jonghyun sulli were burdened by pessimistic ppl. When will these ppl understand that's it's high time now! Just shut up and stop with your fucked up shit. Stop spreading hate and false rumours. The kpop idols that work so hard deserve the world and you have no right to ridicule them.

113,2019-11-1,2019,11,1,21,dq3b7l,"YG Entertainment sued a Vietnamese company partnership for ""Connecting music"" event",HunterYuyuMoon,1572609948," On November 1, 2017, YG Entertaiment Company (in Seoul, South Korea) signed a service contract with Asia Connect Co., Ltd. to hold an event ""Connecting music"" at My Dinh National Stadium. . Under the contract, YG Company provides information, creative advice and support for the Asian Company to run the event. 

Because the two sides agreed not to open a joint account, YG Company transferred the amount of USD 200,000 (equivalent to VND 4.4 billion) to Asia Company to advance. After the program, Asian Company must refund 200,000 USD and 5% of this amount, totaling more than 5 billion VND.

The program ""Connecting music"" held on 9/12/2017 took place successfully. YG requested many times but Asia Company did not pay the above amount.

On April 4, 2018, Mr. Nguyen Viet Anh, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Asia Company signed a memorandum confirming the debt, pledging to pay the above amount. However, Asia Company did not pay, YG Company was forced to sue the City People's Court. Hanoi.

The proceeding process, the legal representative of Asian Company, Mr. Dang Quang Long, did not agree to pay the debt because he thought that at the time of signing the contract, he was an employee, he did not know the contract information. .

On the other hand, according to Mr. Long, Mr. Nguyen Viet Anh has no authority to sign the debt confirmation record. Mr. Nguyen Viet Anh was nominated to be the Chairman of the Board of Members (Members' Council) because he holds 57% of the charter capital, but according to the Company's Charter, Mr. Nguyen Viet Anh is not on the Board of Directors.

The business registration certificate only records the legal representative who is Mr. Dang Quang Long. The written confirmation of the debt is not in the correct format, because there is no authorization, the content of confirmation and commitment is not passed to the Board of Directors. This document recognizes that the payment in USD is a violation of Article 22 of the Foreign Exchange Ordinance.

However, the court based on the contract signed that YG Company deposited $ 200,000 as a deposit to fulfill the obligation. The contract stipulates that Asian Company must refund this amount after 30 days and pay 5%. And the 4/4/2018 minutes only confirm the debt, in fact when paying in VND. Therefore, this record is not invalid.

After calculating the interest, the court forced Asia Company to pay more than 5 billion.

After a tough few days where I feel so emotionally shattered for our boys, Ive just watched DKDKTV review on the current situation and have had an interesting thought. Danny and David commented that MX are not that well known in SK and their international fan base was quiet big (In comparison to BTS at home/abroad). I would recommend watching their YT video on this to fully understand their POV on this. 

I would be perfectly happy, and thoroughly support, to have an International MX whereby ALL seven boys perform outside of SK - but promote as a six man unit in SK. I know that NCT is eventually set to be a global group with sub units in lots of different countries, so I believe it could be done and I believe that the Kpop industry is ever looking to how they can reach international audiences.

What would anybodies thoughts on that be? Maybe Im just clutching at straws while wishful thinking - but i cant yet give up that Wonho doesnt have a future in Kpop and by the rest of their sides on stage. Hes an excellent song writer and producer so he could easily still be creatively involved in the SK side of things......someone tell me im not that mad for thinking this.......",4,0

* Run for Your Life

* Over My Skin

* Heartbreak Hotel

* TALK

* Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus cover)

* Yellow Light

* Independent Woman (Destinys Child cover)

* Teach You

* I Just Wanna Dance

* Invincible Lee Hyori (Lee Hyori cover)

* Invitation (YMGA feat. Uhm Jung Hwa cover)

* Run Devil Run

* Runaway

* The Flower

* Lips on Lips

* In My Blood (Shawn Mendes cover)

* Born Again

* Magnetic Moon

* Run for Your Life (reprise)

Venue: First Ave is awesome. Best live music venue in the Twin Cities and I would argue its one of the best small (sub 3K capacity) in America. There isn't a bad sight line in the place and the acoustics are top notch. Like I didn't show up until a half hour before the show and it was no problem. 

Crowd: Primarily young Hmong women which is not surprising at all. Fun Fact: The Twin Cities has the largest Hmong populations in America outside of CA. After that it was a mix of everybody else. Saw a few mom and dads there with there kids. Crowd was loud and energetic throughout.

The show: I swear to god people, if you have not seen Tiffany hit her high notes in person then you are missing out. She is unbelievably good. And between the singing and dancing she never looked tired. What I'm trying to say is she was on her A game tonight. She had great chemistry with her two backup dances. And her band ( 2 piece band with a drummer and guitarist/keyboardist) sounded great for being so small. 

Highlights: 

* Run Devil Run - Do I need to explain LOL. I'm still in shock I got to see one of my favorite songs live. 

* Independent Woman into Teach You - She started off singing Independent Woman and blended into Teach you. And it worked so well. 

* Wrecking Ball - You ever here a cover so good that the original song is now dead to you?  Sit down Miley this is Fanny's song now

Final Thoughts: IIRC before The Flower she gave a little talk about loving and taking care of yourself. I cant be the only one who thought she was trying to talk about Sulli without bringing the mood down. So it was a little weird. But overall 11/10 see her live immediately. 

Bonus: I wasn't there for this but [she bought hot chocolate for people waiting in line.](https://twitter.com/xolovesttfy/status/1190445313342836738?s=20)",20,140

Now, all of the members except Kai have regular superpowers like fire, ice, all that jazz. You must be wondering what Kai's power iswhy dance of course!

So, to kill the evil robot lady, Kai uses his dancing power to kill her with his charmwhile doing the Monster choreography. I'm not joking, he starts doing the Monster choreography solo to kill her. 

I don't know why, but I just find that so amusing. Just picturing the director going ""yo Kai, we need ya to dance for the robot lady real quick, just do the Monster choreo"". 

Is there anything you've noticed that's been intentionally put in an MV that makes it a lot better or funnier?",3,2

If an artist  have only 13 sons in +3 years... you can't have a unique reason for it. Blackpink members didn't write none of their actual songs and possibly didn't write any song at all. Blackpink goes everywhere to model events, film ads and take photos to some magazine while yg record studio is empty and Teddy is working on their songs. Even members from other yg groups had a hole in blackpink songs.

Blinks will say ""yg dont let them""......

Some songwritter  YG has/had

BIGBANG: GD and TOP

2NE1: Dara and CL

iKON = BI, Bobby

Winner: Mino

Solo artist: PSY, Lee Hi

BLACKPINK: ...

Yea, YG DO let their artist to compose.

BLACKPINK has potencial, but today they are a full model digital influencers group but singers at party time. Four celebrities, but zero artists.

There are many people who like to see how albums are doing through the year.  The chart will be reset in January after the 2019 numbers have been fully recorded and concluded.

Standard Items: **Please note the last column tells you what date the numbers go through.  Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.**  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release from the month listed in the title* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

281,2019-11-3,2019,11,3,2,dqmyfb,Whose profile would you be interested in knowing more?,ThisGuyKpops,1572714027,"Hey kpop redditors, this is Jojo. I usually do weekly translation here. On the side, I run a youtube channel making virtual kpop library.  Recently, I have been interested in doing more in depth profile of kpop artist. 

Like this one. [Zion T \[Mini Profile\]](https://youtu.be/QwiVGyzACmo). 

Since this is the biggest forum that I know, I was wondering whose profile you would be interested in knowing more about?  I'm trying to get a feel for who are the popular ones you would like to get to know more of. 

You can list as many as you want, but....I try to make one video a week , so naturally...if you pick S-tier like G.D, Jay Park, IU, PSY, BTS....the research would take so long that it would take month to make the video, ..which isn't to discourage you to name them, just saying...I would consider them but perhaps later on...

Priority would naturally go to I would maybe A-B tier list (to whatever standard you can apply to them), group that disbanded (so no more story can be developed later), nobody too recent. (can't do profile who debut this year, there wouldn't be enough to do profile on), or soloist/soloist who came out of a group (like sunmi, hwasa, etc...). 

I'll look through the list and see the upvotes and try to accommodate as much as I can.   


Thanks for your time.",18,46

I just wanted to know about people's experiences like which groups have you bought for, how much was it, what came with it, and the question you asked?

Its a male Kpop group, a heavy rap song that starts off with like.... a choir chanting really spookily. I hope thats enough info to go by!",3,1

Got intrigued by it, click on it and I am both impressed and terrified at how advanced technology has become. The actress in that video looks exactly like Jisoo and if there wasn't any watermark on that video I will probably already assumed that the video is legit. There is a few more video like that on the site with DeepFake technology used on other Kpop idol. So far I found Twice Tzuyu, Blackpink Rose and Jisoo.  


Not really a model citizen myself but as a somewhat decent human being I feel like the original creator of this video had gone too far and I think it is illegal to this thing. I'm posting this here because I have no idea how to report that video but if any of their fans here know how then DM me and I will give you the link to the video.

Seeing my name on the With Drama website nearly  broke me at work. I have been following DAY6 since the very beginning and since moving to Korea in 2016, I have seen them in concert about 13 times. The Pop Up fansign was a different breed where you had to at least buy one item and merch (the store itself had merch for the Entropy album as well as remaining items from past comebacks and concerts) and for every w20,000 you spent, you get one entry into the fansign (better than buying multiple albums!) In the end I bought two albums and a bunch of merch I was missing out on. I must have saved up all of my luck ([I haven't tried for a fansign since Sam Kim's last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a2nuk2/sam_kim_weekend_fansigns_181201_181202/)) as I got in! I was finally going to personally meet my favourite group!

Cue Saturday evening. DAY6 were having a busy day as they were already doing Music Core as well as having a pretty long outdoor fanmeeting (where the air was absolutely terrible) so the fansign itself was at 8pm in Digital Media City (where a lot of the big broadcasting stations are based in Seoul). I just brought myself and my album to sign as JYP have made it recently that their idols will not be accepting gifts or props from fansigns. Also, the atmosphere was a little bit tense following the shit that happened between MYDAYs and the fan managers/Security at the Yeoido fansign the day before but as things went on it didn't seem as bad. I think the managers got wind that MYDAYs were particularly pissed about it all.

I was number 78th and took my seat. I really wasn't nervous (even though I should have been, this is my ultimate group!) but I was just calm and happy to be there. I chatted with some of the foreign MYDAYs around me and one Japanese fan kindly offered to film me with the members as long as I filmed her (deal!) and I just waited my turn. Then I went up. Here was how it went.

**Wonpil:** He was first. He looked at me with those gorgeous eyes and said hello, asking me where I was from. I told him (I'm a Brit) and he smiled and said he loved the UK. He then took my hand and I just melted. He is stunning up close. He was surprised that I could speak in Korean but honestly I am not that great and I am even worse when I am nervous. We chatted for a bit and the entire time he never stopped looking into my eyes and kept holding my hand. Man, he is beautiful!!

**Jae:** So he is my bias. He and I also share a mutual friend in Korea. When I told him I am said friend his eyes widened and said, ""Oh, so YOU'RE \[NessieSenpai\]! \[mutual friend\] talks about you all the time! It is so good to finally meet you!"" I was gone. To know I am actually on his radar killed me. We talked about said friend and me hailing from the the UK and it was just so comfortable but it totally threw me for a loop. I told him I have been a fan of his since before DAY6 and it was an honour to finally meet him and he said he was super grateful to hear it. My 2019 was already made by this point.

**Young K:** Hearing that I was British, he greeted me with a (terrible xD) UK accent. I also did a giant BRRRAAAAAPPPP for him which the entire group and MYDAYs cheered for. He said I must love Wanna Go Back (he does the brrraaaa in the song) I said that song was my anthem and we both laughed. He asked if I like Emergency as Jae does the brrraaaa in that and as if on cue, Jae did one too just then. I said yeah but like London people do it better. Both Young K and Jae were like OH SHI- and we shared a laugh.

**Dowoon:** He is just so cute and... why was I so nervous to meet him? I have no idea, I just got really shy and could barely speak. I asked him if he wanted to try speaking English with me and he said sure. He said DAY6 are going to a concert in London soon (2020) and I said that's cool and all but I actually live in Seoul. His eyes widened in surprise and asked me where. Told him, he said that's really cool!

**Sungjin**: I needed to be rooted back to earth, so having Sungjin last was really cool. He is just... so chill? He relaxed me, talking about food and I think he sensed I was nervous so he took my hand and locked fingers with me. We talked about food (of course!) and found out we both share a love for spicy food. Speaking to him in this capacity made me understand why he is the leader. He is the calm of the storm. Out of the non English speakers, he was the one I talked to the longest.

After that, there was more signs and then they had a group prop photo op and then they had to go (to rest for Inkigayo as it was their last music show for this era). I was, and still am, so thankful for this opportunity. I never thought I would get to go to a fansign for DAY6, especially as this has been their most successful selling album so far, but the Lord doth do  wonders. I will treasure this day, and the album, for the rest of my life!!",7,102

404,2019-11-4,2019,11,4,3,dr46cd,"Tiffany Young @ The Vic Theater Chicago,IL 191102 VIP",hawknamedmoe,1572804496,"A few days before the show I got an email explaining the VIP process. Where I needed to be and when. If anyone is curious, I can put up a screenshot of it. 

My girlfriend and I got to the theater around 2pm  to pick up our tickets and there were about 10 people in line already for GA. The weather was tolerable for midwesterners, but you guys who waited that long were troopers. The wind made it rough. 

A few hours later we came back. The VIP line was at a different door from the general admission. Basically lining up in the opposite direction. The majority of us arrived 15 minutes before the email told us it will start. It was amusing how many people were meekly asking is this the line for VIP? I did it myself. Were just humble and dont want to brag too much :)

The VIP line got long by to time an assistant came out to check our IDs and give us wristbands. After a security check and ticket scan, we got in another line that led up a staircase. The pictures with Tiffany were in groups of 5 so the staff counted off and split us up. They were nice and accommodating to people who wanted to be together. The Gf and I were with two friends and one girl on her own. Made small talk with the group. 

While in line, Tiffany and her staff walked by and went up another flight of stairs to start the meet and greet. Nobody noticed at first. We were on our phones. She was also in a hoodie so she blended in with the crowd. A few of us noticed and we nudged each other going oh hey! Its Tiffany! The crowd got excited as she waved and went upstairs. That meant the meet and greet was starting!

The process was fairly quick. Staff took our coats and gave us the rules. No phones out. Hand any gifts to them and theyll give them to Tiffany later. We were all nervous and excited. 

The photo process went like this:
We walked up as a group and got in position with Tiffany in the middle. She told us the first picture well pose making a moon with our hands. Second was the heart hand. I was happy that the lone girl in our group got to stand next to Tiffany. We were joking earlier about her photoshoppjng everybody out of the photos when we get them later online. Now she has two pics that she can crop to be just her with Tiffany with her arm around her shoulder. I know theres people who want that more personal meet and greet experience, so Im glad she got it. 

After the pictures, she gave us each a hug and we were sent on our ways with our signed posters.

VIP let us in the venue early so we all basically camped out in front of the stage.  Tiffany came by AGAIN and people were late to notice AGAIN. The Gf and I were at the bar and I went oop there she is again. Eventually there was a cheer as people caught on. It was amusing because I know a lot of us were checking out her instagram in order to get a peek at what her look would be tonight. Who wouldve thought that Tiffany Young would just be casually walking around the theater to get around before the show started? The Vic isnt the Tokyo Dome so its expected, but still surreal.

Overall, it was a nice experience. Ive never done a Hi Touch before or even seen any other Kpop act besides Tiffany Young. Still fairly new to kpop. I was surprised by how tiny she was. That line is said a lot on this subreddit when talking about meeting idols. I think we imagine them to be as big as their personalities.",16,77

A place to talk about new and/or underrated Kpop groups/soloists/bands and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to the last full Nugu Roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dkolub/nugu_roundup_16_agent_kolavo_sis_has_intercepted/), and [here's a link to last week's Halloween Special](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dnwvu1/nugu_roundup_1313_theres_something_strange_in/).  

I asked for some boy group recommendations two weeks ago and received a lot of great ones.  This week let's get to know M.O.N.T.

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**M.O.N.T.**

**Who are they?:** A three member boy group under Fly Music Entertainment.  Their name is an acronym of 'Members Of the National Team' and represents them as the national representatives for Kpop.

**Company:** M.O.N.T. seems to be the only group under Fly Music Entertainment right now, but from their website it appears that they ran auditions for additional male trainees in August of this year, so they may have something else in the works.

**Members:**

His stage name means ""The Person You've Been Waiting For"" in Old-Korean.

**Debut:** January 4th, 2019 with Will You Be My Girlfriend? ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2EQWus7zEA)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vlsMqND4s)) A colorful cute concept poppy song that's easy to listen to.

**Most Recent Comeback:** August 25th, 2019 with Rock Paper Scissors ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVhfIOZ_uCU)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOqLo7YfIJo)) A funky jam with a great instrumental track that blends their cute style with a bit more swagger.

**Other MVs and Live Stages:**

* Sorry ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-aXAJR60Y)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM9bZdmoWwQ)) - A pre-debut single, a nice chill ballad showing off their vocal talents
* BAE ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBbeoPAGWsA)) The second single from their second album ""Awesome Up!"" - A softer sound but very nice, with an MV shot in Poland.
* Daehan Minguk Mansae/Korea Hooray!/Love Live the Republic of Korea ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HEUJISrsxo)) - The first of two videos filmed on Dokdo Island, an island held by Korea but the subject of a current territorial dispute with Japan.  It's a rousing Korean-patriotic anthem of a song released to celebrate Korean National Liberation Day.
* The Korean Island Dokdo ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z285W7-ciis)) - The 2nd of their Dokdo Island MVs, I really recommend watching this one with the English subtitles on, the lyrics are a series of facts about the island which recited in the harder hip-hop style of the song I find unintentionally hilarious, but he song is a banger, combining some hard-hitting hip hop with traditional Korean instruments and some very cool choreography

**Trivia:** The members trained for a year in a secluded mountain retreat on Ganghwado Island, an island off of the northwest coast of the Korean Mainland.   They've been marketed as the 'Rural Idols' and 'Organic Idols' as well as national representatives of Korea.  They've toured extensively worldwide including Europe, the United States, and South and Central America.  They're currently in Buenos Aries before further dates elsewhere in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia before heading out on another European leg later in the month.  Given that they come from a relatively unknown company, their crazy tour schedule, the surprisingly high production value on their Dokdo Island videos (and really, the existence of them at all unless the guys really are just that concerned about a territorial dispute over some virtually uninhabited islands) I have a feeling there's some government money and influence at work here, not that I'm complaining, the songs are good.  All three members competed in Mixnine.

**Migyo**

**Who Is She:** A female soloist, currently independent from what I can tell

**Genre:** Ballad

**MVs and Live Performances:**

* Rain Sound ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Doc15zkkvjU)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-r8t3pMrLs))
* A Scar Left by the Season ([digital single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk_7HbdVxLg))
* Nevertheless ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNytuOOP7rQ)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uIO8oK_Gwg))
* If I Were You ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgiyfLiOSc))  

**YouTube Channel:** [Migyo's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UqcHiuMVMtmerrSayWIQA/videos)

**Trivia:** Migyo was formerly the main vocalist of the Bob Girls (sister group to Crayon Pop) and LoveUs (also as leader) before starting her solo career.  Her latest comeback, If I Were You, was funded by a Makestar project after leaving her previous company JG Star Entertainment due to their failure to properly pay her.  JG Star Entertainment attempted to slander her character but her former group mates raised their voices to say the claims were all nonsense.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ICU**

**Who Are They:** A four member girl group under Liz Entertainment

**Genre:** Cute

**MVs and Live Performances:**

* Cupid ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNTrvOROv1Q)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGr9nTPvuwQ))
* [ICU Pops in Seoul Offstage Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qdHMWWBJys)

**KProfiles Link**: [ICU](https://kprofiles.com/icu-members-profile/)

**Trivia:** The group will apparently have an 'admissions' system where new members may be added in the future.  The name ICU is supposed to stand for 'I See You' but for some reason they pronounce it 'Iku' in the MV.   While the audio production and the MV are a bit rough around the edges due to obvious budget limitations, the girls are charming and the song has enough fun and odd moments that I'm a fan.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Special Feature - In Memorium:**

**Bob Girls**

**Who were they?:** A a four member girl group under Chrome Entertainment

**Genre:** Vocal Forward/R&amp;B

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* No Way ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhF63H1xRJI)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzQQ-y9MNTs)) A sexy sultry vocal driven R&amp;B influenced song
* Oh My Boy ([digital single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5fsu2YZ8Qo)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7sPe43o-E)) A poppier summer song
* Love Christmas ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNaTeHmfyKw)) with Crayon Pop, K-Much, and Zan-Zan.  Honestly this is one of the best Kpop Christmas songs I've heard, and the MV is so simple yet so adorable, this one is going into my Christmas Song playlist next month for sure.

**Active Between:** June 14th, 2014 - February 15th, 2015

**Reason for disbandment:** Member Jina was forced to leave the group due to developing encephalitis (a disease where the brain swells) leading the group to disband.

**Trivia:** Dahye changed her stage name to Migyo and with fellow Bob Girls member Danbi joined the group LoveUs, which was unfortunately also rather short lived.  She's now a soloist (see above).

461,2019-11-4,2019,11,4,14,drcx8d,Kpop MVs have been ruining me.,only900more2go,1572843910,"I grew up listening to anime op/endings while drawing. One day in the side bar of youtube suggestions the door to kpop opened and I fell into it hardcore. It was the whole bundle deal that I didn't even know I wanted in my life. It's been around 10 years. I still obsessively watch kpop. 

This isn't some recent epiphany, but I have as of late been taking it more seriously. Kpop has pulled me away from my dear hobby drawing and years of seeing the model-esque members have negatively attributed to my self image etc. I remember in my first relationship I was irritable that I couldn't binge it like I used to and when we broke off I had so much free time that I felt lost cause I finally wasn't binging on kpop nor being clung to from my clingy ex. I became so productive and flourished. Now here I am fallen back into the addiction looking back missing the productive person. 

I know any country's ent industry have this power over viewers no matter what generation even social media, but for me it's kpop. The kpop fanbase also is so persistent to try and push their favs and support them that I feel it's possibly naturally even more obsessive than others. 

TLDR: Do you feel kpop has had a negative effect in your life no matter how small?",3,2

Many people made racist remarks and insulted me because I shared my opinion. A facebook group said I was talking trash and told alot of blackjacks to mass hate my video!

What are your all time favorite works of music released in k-pop in this decade? The landscape of the k-pop industry has changed a lot since the beginning of this decade, from the trends in music to the way idols interact with fans to the way fans consume media today. Groups that debuted at the beginning of the decade are now the top groups as we are now almost at the end of it. What are some of the musical works or even music videos that have stood out the most, that you think have stood the test of time or that still hold up even when you revisit them today? When people talk of the 2010s in k-pop in the future, what are some works that you think would be brought up in the conversation?",11,3

I'm heading to Japan March/April and I was hoping I'd be able to catch a concert while I'm there.

I know Kpop groups often go to Japan for fanmeets/concerts, not just for tours, but I can only ever find tour dates online. I think I either just don't know where to look or most groups I'm in to just haven't announced that far ahead.

I was wondering if there was anywhere I could keep an eye on what concerts have been announced. Does anyone have any experience with this?",2,0

Fans have been trying to trend #WHEREisKOKOLIN to get FNC to respond, but unfortunately, we are too small of a fandom.

Kokoro's birthday was on the first of November, and FNC didn't make a birthday post on their company twitter, like they do with all their other artists, and nothing was posted by the members on their group twitter account. This is making fans very worried, as this is no longer just the members being on an unannounced hiatus, but they are being ignored by the company.

Neither member is Korean so some fans speculated visa issues, but when Cherry Bullet had an event in Kokoro's home town and she still wasn't allowed to participate.

I've liked Pentagon since their pre-debut show Pentagon Maker and I know some of the members may go off to the military next year, so I figured I'd see them when I had the chance. TBH I haven't been following them super closely lately but I watched a bunch of clips before the show and remembered how much I liked them and how annoyed I still am at Cube for losing them the hype from Shine. So glad I went!

The show itself was Friday evening at the Bataclan Theater in Paris. The venue itself was really nice, actually, but TBH being in that theater also made me a bit nervous. Everything about the venue and security was all smooth and normal, though. I had balcony tickets since I can't stand for an entire concert and was worried I wouldn't be able to see much, but actually had a nice view even though I was in the fifth row; the balcony is laid out really well.

I got there at about 3:30 for the show at 7:00; lining up for the balcony started at 5:00 but I didn't realize I needed to grab a number for the line so ended up pretty far back in the line. Whoops. There were some fans (fansites?) handing out pictures of the members to people while in line; I asked for a Jinho one initially. They had some leftover at the end and were frantically giving them to everyone going into the show, so I got a Shinwon one as well.

The show was actually Yanan's birthday, so even though he's sitting out of the tour due to injury, fans passed out little banners for him before the show and told everyone to wave them during Spring Snow (...I think it was during Spring Snow? I don't remember which song exactly.) So everyone sang Happy Birthday afterward the song.... and then Kino made everyone sing it again so he could record it on his phone to send to Yanan. Pentagon seemed to really appreciate it!

The show itself was super fun! Pentagon's concept is all about having a good time on stage and it really shows. The set list was similar to what I saw online; mostly their title tracks and their bright, upbeat b-sides with an emphasis on more recent songs - I really like their upbeat songs the most, so I was really happy with the track list. Kino/Yeoone/Hui/Yuto also did a cover of Bad Guy Billie Eilish with a sexy concept - I had admittedly never heard the song before, but I feel like I've seen 20 different covers of it in the past week from kpop groups, but they really killed it. And Jinho/Shinwon/Hongseok/Wooseok did a cover of Best Song Ever (Shinwon is well known to be a huuuuuuuge One Direction fan so I wasn't surprised)

Hongseok's parents were also at the show for their anniversary! He mentioned it during one of their talk sections and everyone applauded really loudly. His parents were in the first row in the balcony not too far from where I was, so I peaked over and saw his dad was recording a closeup of him for a bunch of songs, so that was super cute.

Other miscellaneous thoughts about the show: Kino's such a good dancer, but also Yeoone was much more charismatic on stage than I expected; I've never really noticed him much before. He and Shinwon threw a ton of water on the crowd during the encore, haha. Hui really likes to tease the members on stage; he and Jinho are such good vocals and so stable live. Jinho flashed Hongseok's abs at one point and then Hui mimed like he would do the same to Jinho. They all practiced some French phrases, which was really cute, and the crowd went wild for it.

The show lasted about 2 hours and I had to leave right after so I could make the last train home, but I did get a little Pentagon wristband while waiting for my ride. Really had a fun time, they're super fun to see in person!",8,73

I want to know if there is a correlation between the popularity (brand recognition, charting, streams, sales, variety ++) and the treatment groups get from the company. I know this may be very subjective but for those who have stanned a long time or have been around to witness the rise and fall of groups, how do you personally gauge this? 

I once read that when a group reaches 3 years and they still have to bag a hit then its pretty much harder for them to press on further. For people who have been a fan of groups whose popularity started to plateau, what did the company do in response to this? Have there been any groups that have been an exception to this? 

As an SM fan, I know pretty much once your group hits beyond 5 years regardless of the popularity, promos really start to slow down. This leaves me worried for what will happen to Red Velvet honestly even if theyre selling out more than they used to before. 

But for the other fans, have there any been exceptions? What is your experience with your groups? I would love to hear your thoughts!",34,35

Hi, my name is JOJO owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w?view_as=subscriber). I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back on thursday night for update!

As if we people don't deserve any second chance in our life..It's not OK for him to blame himself and leave Monsta X to make everything better he deserves better and happy life!

Blackpink: would change Lisa to main rapper, possibly Jennie to visual (although Jisoo is great too so not gonna die on this hill)

BTS: add Taehyung to the dance line (this has happened now (woo finally!) but I thought it for many years before it did. 

EXO: I might actually classify Baekhyun a lead dancer, especially based on what Ive seen with SuperM! Hes improved SO much over the years. 

(G)-Idle: Miyeon should be visual imo, either as well as or instead of Shuhua. 

SNSD: I love Taeyeon but didnt seem the best candidate for leader, which I think she also expressed at times. Perhaps Sooyoung as leader instead. 

These are my thoughts so far! What do you guys think?",66,30

Their reason is to have that long legs look but many idols already have long legs that it makes them look like an ostrich. 2009  was snsd's start of success. They look hot in low waisted short shorts and skinny jeans with that sexy long slim waists. Yet people view them as the queen of long sexy legs.

However, I think these 2 things make it easy for some of their ""branding"" to be lost in the ether. 1. bc these guys r never asked to recite/explain their concepts in front of media; 2. written/literary Chinese is super hard to translate accurately into English. So the connected storyline of their mythology across most of their title tracks has gone over the heads of most international fans. I myself missed it until I sat down to translate Moonwalk and then accidentally found references to Moonwalk in Take Off and went back and finished translating Take Off. Just thought I'd share these resources with anyone trying to get to know WayV. Hope y'all find it interesting at least. Basically, I'll just be providing the English translations of their title tracks in chronological order, so you can hopefully pick up on the continuous storyline across these songs. Here we go! Please forgive the weird formatting, I copy pasted from a word doc and can't seem to get rid of the line spacing. 

** (Dream Launch)**

**Release date:** Jan 17, 2019

\[Intro: Lucas\]

*Yeah, let's go*

\[Chorus\]

The universe swings from left to right

Im still learning to navigate

To launch (my) dreams directly into distant outer space

Even if I become weightless

A smile will remain on my face

Waiting on the launch of (my) dreams, gaining speed, nearing ever closer to success

*Oh yeah, yeah*

\[Verse 1: Lucas, Ten\]

I have no voice to shout, the dizzy sensation of gliding

(My) heart is about to jump out, hair has also been blown a mess

What is *counting down now, four, three, two, one*

I brave ahead

but in reality, its too late for me to turn back

\[Verse 2: Yangyang, Ten\]

Im afraid that Ill turn the route map in the wrong direction

Thats why all this time (I/we) couldnt catch up with the orbit of the earth

Casting aside all fear *its alright so far*

Once childish faces

These days have already slowly grown up

\[Pre-Chorus: Kun, Hendery, **Xiaojun**\]

If the stars that are light years away

Shines brightly still with such perseverance

Each push forward can count as advancing

*Ready, yeah*

If (we) say youth/being young is the reason

Then passion is the fuel that ignites ideals/dreams

Lets decide like this

*Oh, yeah*

\[Chorus\] repeat

\[Verse 3: Ten\]

What is courage, is it not losing strength in your legs\* (an expression for losing courage)

Is it this weightless state

Accidentally knocking over (my) sense of direction

When can (we) land on the highest peak of the world

*But thats okay cause*

The me that you understand is not lonely

\[Verse 4: Lucas, Yangyang\]

No matter what time, you are there to give me courage

*Lets keep up the good work*

The road becomes more smooth *yeah*

My views I will myself express

Goals I will myself achieve

Anywhere I want to go, that will be where (I go)

Brushing off my shoulders

\[Post-Chorus: Xiaojun, Winwin, Kun\]

Want to be a star that guides the way

Striving so (I) must redouble perseverance

Each push forward must make advancing possible

*Ready, yeah*

You and Is blueprint is youth

The plan for our ideals/dreams is even more sleek

One word and its settled

*Ooh baby*

\[Chorus\] Repeat

\[Bridge: Hendery, Yangyang, Xiaojun, Lucas, Winwin\]

Even though (you) laugh and say Im *Dreaming*

*Are you thinking what I'm thinking?*

If its a dream then why do I remember it so vividly

Testing out my ability, using my brand new attitude

Anticipating that moment of soaring high, completing all of my waiting

Want to live...

\[Chorus: All, Lucas, Xiaojun, Kun\]

... and fly within the universe

*No, I should say*

The universe will also be moved\* (with emotion)

*(Hey woah with me)*

I control my future

To launch (my) dreams directly into distant outer space *(another)*

(Never wasting a single second)

The cold wind during flight

*(Ooh Yeah)*

Cannot wipe away my smile

Waiting on the launch of (my) dreams, gaining speed, nearing ever closer to success

(I never find excuses to slow down)

*Oh yeah, yeah*

\[Hook: All, Xiaojun, Kun, Ten\]

Here we go, here we go, fire

*(Ooh Yeah)*

*Here it goes, here it goes, higher*

*(Little bit higher)*

*Oh oh (ay!) oh oh (ay!)*

*(Just a little bit)*

*Here we go, here we go, fire (fire yeah)*

*Here it goes, here it goes, higher*

*(Little bit higher)*

*Oh oh (ay!) oh oh (ay!)*

\[Outro: Xiaojun\]

No matter how long (we) still have to wait

&amp;#x200B;

**Take Off  - WayV V**

**Release Date:** May 9, 2019

\[Intro\]

*Ignition sequence starts*

*Six five four three two one*

(Fly)

\[Verse 1\]

*Yeah* the city rain sobs with emotion

Neon lights flash on and off

Street lamps illuminate the back figure of the traveller of the sky

Feathers like an enigma endlessly spinning aloft

They say that true believers will always believe *hey*

I discover an unidentified flying object

Many gaze at the sky

Yet pretend as if nothing transpired

*Yeah yeah* theres a trance of the scent of gun powder

Why do I hear the sound of heartbeats counting down

As if the launching pad has already been prepped

The ground shakes, press the button

Turbulent winds scream wildly

*Yeah* if records have never yet been set

*Dont be sad with it*

Your freedom is a rule that cannot be broken

Like a mysterious signal that does not exist

Streaking across the radar in a flash of flames

\[Pre-chorus\]

*Can I be honest*

*I so hate to be controlled oh no no*

The only clause of the flight regulation

Is to forget all clauses

To ascend or to orbit

Only believing in the compass of free will

\[Chorus\]

Taking off without wings

*Im ready for take off take off*

Toward worlds beyond the sky *take off*

Taking off without wings

*Im ready for take off take off*

Toward worlds beyond the sky *take off*

Your innate wild nature is to gallop

You have the ambition to defy gravity

You are an existence outside of the norm

*So baby* toward worlds beyond the sky

*Take off yeah*

*Oh oh* who can tame? I ascend to the clouds

*Oh oh* taking off without wings

*Im ready for take off*

\[Verse 2\]

(*Three, Two, One)*

*Talkin bout*

Natural selection, why does (my) soul start to hunger

DNA determines survival of the fittest, those who lose will have died righteously(1)

Maybe the beauty that I long for

Has already disappeared without a trace from the surface of the earth

I lift my gaze towards the city of the sky

*Yeah* leap with full strength, focus, lifting both arms high

Wave then roar, achieving altitude

*Yeah* with the world

I understand my incomprehensibility

*So* let them hunt insatiably for novelty(2), there are those that have no need for wings(3)

*Rock your world*

Splendid celestial bodies

*Can be me and you*

\[Chorus\]

Taking off without wings

*Im ready for take off take off*

Toward worlds beyond the sky *take off*

Taking off without wings

*Im ready for take off take off*

Toward worlds beyond the sky *take off*

Your innate wild nature is to gallop

You have the ambition to defy gravity

You are an existence outside of the norm

*So baby* toward worlds beyond the sky

*Take off*

\[Bridge\]

(Fly)

*Take off* (fly)

*Take off*

*Oh* gazing down at earth

Then conquering the universe behind (me)

The rhythm of the countdown, *say goodbye* to the ordinary

Towards a future hidden in the depths, we fly

\[Chorus\]

Taking off without wings

*Im ready for take off take off*

Toward worlds beyond the sky *take off*

Taking off without wings

*Im ready for take off take off*

Toward worlds beyond the sky *take off*

Your innate wild nature is to gallop

You have the ambition to defy gravity

You are an existence outside of the norm

*So baby* toward worlds beyond the sky

*Take off take off*

\[Refrain\]

*&lt;Come on* toward worlds beyond the sky

*Take off take off*

Bringing with you all the wonder/beauty&gt; x 2

*Oh oh* who can tame? I ascend to the clouds

*Oh oh* taking off without wings(4)

*Take off* (fly)

Notes:

1. : this phrase literally - ""losers achieve righteousness"" - comes from the phrase  - If you cant achieve success, you can achieve righteousness/honor/goodness. Meaning that there is always risk involved in any venture in life; not everyone will be successful, but those who try with diligence will still be respected even in failure. So here the lyrics acknowledge the inherent risk involved with WayVs ""taking off without wings"" venture.

2. : literally hunt - odd - describing peoples tendency to eagerly and insatiably look for novel and strange things to satisfy their curiosity.

3. : wings, but can also mean any form of outside assistance

4. There are 3 dictionary definitions for  (the Chinese title for Take Off): 1. ""the myth that there are people that can fly without wings""; 2. ""the phenomenon of things that can take off/spread rapidly without outside aid""; 3. ""to believe that a bird without wings can fly, i.e., to too easily believe in something blindly."" Given these 3 definitions, its super interesting to me that these lyrics also acknowledge the risk and almost naive idealism of this entire enterprise: a big impossible dream to abandon your home planet and start a brand new civilization elsewhere (see Moonwalk lyrics). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Moonwalk  WayV**

**Release Date:** October 29, 2019

3, 2, 1

When you said that was light, gave meaning to light

Walking on water, causing waves to ripple

We have the chance to create the world, to be revered by all

*Hold up!*

&amp;#x200B;

When all around was primeval chaos, dawn breaks across the sky *Yeah*

Allow me to open up the good within this chaos

As if returning to the birth of the universe

The darkness was tamed, competing with the earth, love flowed forth from the water we gave

*Go, go, go, go (Go)*

Life is incredible *Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa*

&amp;#x200B;

*Ooh* after flying and endlessly searching

Civilization has finally touched down on the seventh day *Yeah*

&amp;#x200B;

The future comes swirling all at once

Dreams breaks open like a stone, like the sky

I, who has been chosen by love, heroically tread *Moonwalk*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*When the classics have all been documented, greatness unknown

You arrive at the chosen city in the sky, thus, popularizing(1) *Moonwalk*

When people sing in praise of myths

I chose to bend my waist

Towards the newly formed world

Taking the first step forward *Moonwalk*

&amp;#x200B;

*Moonwalkin, moonwalkin*

From the highest vantage point extending to the horizon

My city, idle spectators do not enter

Incomprehensible hurricane will soon strike

I will build a nation thats chosen by the heavens *(Cool)*

Only dreamers are allowed to proudly enter

I never deny that Im a faithful follower of those who forge new paths *(Come on)*

At the peak of the golden pyramids, there must be a road thats bluer than the sky *Ah!*

&amp;#x200B;

No need for moats and city walls *Yeah*

Sadness naturally has been banished by joy *(Dripping)*

Your smile inevitably will be among the classics

The splendor of the sun, the mysterious allure of the moon, promised(2), therefore existing

*Go, go, go, go (Go)*

Life intensely blossoms *Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa*

&amp;#x200B;

*Ooh* Ceaselessly flying and fearlessly burning

Civilization still has 10,000 years(3) of good(4) *Yeah*

&amp;#x200B;

Following a long endless wait *(woah)*

This century will at last begin *(Woah)*

How many eyes will follow our unrestricted *Moonwalk*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Repeat

&amp;#x200B;

Time sees off those who depart and welcomes those who arrive

I am lonely because I exist here

Until you arrived

An unnamed territory untouched by civilization

Under the call of fate

Setting off for a distant land

*And we gonna take over the moon*

(5, 4, 3, 2, 1) *Moonwalk*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Repeat

&amp;#x200B;

*Moonwalk, moonwalk*

*Moonwalk, moonwalk*

*Moonwalk, yeah*

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

1. : from the image of rapid winds sweeping through and toppling over grass/trees

2. : this is not the common Chinese word for promise but a reference to the Biblical Promised Land i.e. . Legit had to look this up bc Ive never read the Bible in Chinese lol

3. : literally 10,000 years but more just an expression for a long time; Chinese has an additional unit that means 10,000 ( - wan); it doesnt stop at thousand. Ex: 100,000 is 10 wan in Chinese, not 100 thousand.

4. : adjective or noun; adj to describe something as good - beautiful, wonderful, happy, glorious; or noun referring to the goodness itself - fairness, nicety, fineness, etc. LOL so i just used good here &amp; let me brain rest.",2,15

But with all the recent influx of, well... not-so-happy news coming out (which I'm still not over tbh) I've been seeing so many mentions about ""the worst years of K-Pop"" and have been enlightened about it, with 2014 being no. 1 and this year looking like a close contender.

So, I'm not a Monbebe, but I feel really sorry for those who have been affected by recent events and I hope the issue somehow clears up.
Anyways, my best friend is a monbebe and when the news broke out that Wonho left the group, she was totally devastated.
She skipped school that day and at first I thought that was totally understandable. She had been crying all day, so she was too sick to come to school that day.

But at this point she hasn't been in school for over a week. Not because she's still crying or because she's sick. She just spends her entire day on Twitter, clearing up MX's searches and talking about the whole issue. 
I understand wanting to support your favorite group, but neglecting something as important as your education for it is just wrong.

It wouldn't be an issue if we didn't do anything important in school, but we're in 12th grade, every single lesson matters. And to add to that she's already missed an exam, we're in the middle of an exam period after all.

I don't know if I should just let her be or if I should confront her. But how do I confront her without making her upset? This is kind of a touchy issue for her.

And other Monbebes, do you think she's being reasonable?",2,0

If K-pop has a spiritual home, its probably SMTown. Operated bySM Entertainment Co., the six-story complex in Seouls wealthy Gangnam district is a high-tech shrine to South Koreas most successful cultural export. The lobby walls are covered with framed black-and-white headshots of SMs idols, as K-pop stars are known. By the elevators are hundreds of Polaroid-style portraits of the same artists in a more candid light, albeit with skin so touched up it appears carved from marzipan.
The centerpiece of SMTown is a museum honoring the labels most prominent groups. Theres an extensive section forSuper Junior, a 13-member boy band that was one of K-pops first big-ticket acts, and another forGirls Generation, a syrup-sweet ensemble that flirted with global stardom thanks to mixed-language tracks such asI Got a Boy. (I got a boy/ Cool!/ I got a boy/ Nice!/ I got a boy handsome boy!) There are also several displays forSHINee, a five-member male group. Or rather, a formerly five-member male group. In December 2017, lead singer Kim Jong-hyun died by suicide in a Seoul apartment. The depression slowly chipped away at me, finally devouring me, he wrote in a final note. It wasnt my path to become world famous. Its a miracle that I endured all this time. Kim was 27; had he been revered in the West, he might have been remembered in the same breath as other megastars, such as Jimi Hendrix and Amy Winehouse, who died at that age. But at SMTown, Kims death never happened. An otherwise detailed chronology of the band makes no mention of it; on one side of the relevant date hes in the photos, and on the other he isnt.

It wouldnt be entirely fair to call this a metaphor for K-pops core bargain with its audience, but it wouldnt be completely wrong, either. K-pop depends on a highly controlled relationship with fans. The idol, the genres base unit of stardom, is gestated from adolescence through years of grueling training. When hes ready to meet his public, his labels place him in a group, flowing his image and voice into the music, video, and social media streams of fans across East Asia. The ideal idol has a moral record as unblemished as his pores, eschewing drugs, gambling, and public misbehavior of any kind. While female groups employ the usual male-gaze clichsthe flirty schoolgirl, the doe-eyed ingnuethefrank sexualityof a Rihanna or a Lady Gaga would be unthinkable. And even though many, many K-pop songs are about relationships and breakups, labels often discourage dating. What the music loses in edge, it more than gains in marketability. Korea and Japan are conservative societies in many ways, and China, a nascent market, often bans foreign acts it deems negative influences.
But the wall of virtue collapsed this year, thanks to a scandal that continues to grip the industry. It began in January, after a man said hed been beaten by guards for trying to stop a sexual assault at Burning Sun, a Seoul nightclub partly owned by Seungri, one of K-pops most bankable stars. The claims spiraled into a series of overlapping allegations related to sex trafficking, date rape, spy-camera recordings, and bribery. Seungri and several other idols are under criminal investigation, while the founder ofYG Entertainment Inc., the label responsible for K-pops first global crossover hit,Gangnam Style, resigned as a result of the turmoil. Prosecutors, meanwhile, opened an inquiry into whether police had been running interference for stars, ignoring reports of sexual assault and allowing venues such as Burning Sun to function as hubs of predatory behavior.
The scandal shone an unflattering light on the idol system, which elevates artists from tightly regimented training schools to stardom in their early 20s with money and fame to burn. Its also triggered a larger debate about the treatment of women in South Korea, huge numbers of whom face harassment, assault, or surveillance bymolka, or spycams, which are routinely discovered in hotel rooms and public bathrooms.

Given K-pops titanic cultural and economic significancethe revenue of the four largest K-pop companies in 2018 was about $1.1 billion, according to music export agency DFSB Kollectivea real change in how it operates could shift attitudes in South Korea as a whole. But in a country where social progress often lags behind technological and material advancement, no one is getting their hopes up. For women in South Korea, its a desperate situation, says Sim Sang-jeung, a lawmaker and former presidential candidate whos pushed for stronger protections against assault. At Burning Sun, police and the authorities tried to protect those who have power and conceal crimes, she says. In womens daily lives, nowhere feels safe.

For most of his career, Seungri, whose real name is Lee Seung-hyun, stayed within K-pops guardrails. Born in the southern city of Gwangju, he made his debut at 15 as part of Big Bang, YGs first attempt at an international idol act. Reception was initially mixed, but the group eventually became one of K-pops biggest names. Seungri, who has a square jaw, thick hair, and prominent dimples, began releasing solo work and became one of the most recognizable Korean celebritiesstaying popular even after a 2012 sex scandal sparked by a Japanese magazines report that while spending time in the country hedhad sex. He appeared in Korean and Japanese movies and variety shows, and in 2018 embarked on his first solo tour, to support his albumThe Great Seungri, whose cover depicted him in a Gatsby-esque tuxedo.

Even as he reached the heights of Korean entertainment, Seungri faced a looming challenge. All South Korean men must serve in the military for up to two yearsunderstandable, in a country still formally at war with its northern neighbor. K-pop stars tend to defer service for as long as they can, but they must, almost without exception, enter the military by 28. Tastes shift quickly, and once an idol has disappeared from the public eye he may never regain prominence. This deadline pushes many male stars to diversify their income by investing in restaurants, bars, fashion labels, and real estate. Seungri, who was due to enlist this year, took a more energetic approach than most, starting a ramen chain and taking a stake in a cosmetics company. He also invested in Burning Sun, a nightclub in the basement of Gangnams Le Mridien hotel, serving as the face of its marketing efforts and making periodic appearances as a DJ.

In December a music-video art director named Kim Sang-kyo posted to an online forum an account of a night hed recently spent at Burning Sun. Kim said that as he was leaving a friends birthday party in the early hours of the morning, a woman he didnt know ran up behind him, apparently seeking protection from a man who was chasing her. When Kim tried to stand between them, the man threw a punch, followed by several others who did the same. Outside, Burning Sun security guards continued the beating. According to Kim, the police dismissed his account and accepted the guards explanation of what had occurred, taking him into custody and delivering yet another beating. Officers later accused Kim of engaging in sexual harassment himself, which he denies.
His post went viral in January, prompting Seoul police to investigate. After local media published transcripts of texts that they claimed showed Seungri arranging prostitutes for visiting investors, officersquestioned himabout suspicions that women were being trafficked and assaulted at Burning Sun. They declared him an official suspect in a prostitution investigation in March. His lawyer declined to comment on the allegations, though Seungri has previously denied wrongdoing. (Burning Sun is no longer in business.)

**The best teacher for young idols is to see fellow idols get into a scandal and disappear**

In keeping with K-pops intolerance for scandal, Seungri immediately announced that hed retire from the entertainment industry. The same day, the Korean press published chat transcripts showing another star, Jung Joon-young, sharing videos of sex partners apparently taken without their knowledge. Another person in the chat discussed drugging a woman. In response to one story, Jung said, You raped her, followed by a symbol for laughter. He was indicted for sexual assault and for filming women without their consent; he has denied the first charge but admitted to the second.

Later that month, President Moon Jae-in called for a wide-ranging investigation of sex offenses linked to the entertainment industry and ordered the reopening of inquiries into past allegations. These included the case of 29-year-old actress Jang Ja-yeon, who died by suicide in 2009 after leaving a note that said shed been forced to sleep with more than 30 prominent men.
The revelations continued, and for the first time it seemed as if a business obsessed with managing its image might burst open. More musicians were investigated for sharing spycam videos, and several police officers were accused of cooperating with Burning Suns owners to overlook drug use and abusive behavior at the club. Korean media at one point reported that Yang Hyun-suk, YGs founder and head producer, had used prostitutes to court the Zelig of Asian sleazefinancier Jho Low, whos facing criminal charges (which he denies) in the U.S. and Malaysia, for thealleged lootingof a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. The men had been introduced by Psy, theGangnam Stylestar. (Low denied engaging in improper behavior in South Korea. After an investigation, police declined to pursue pimping charges against Yang, whostepped downfrom his executive positions in hopes of stabilizing YG, according to a statement he issued in June. Shameless and humiliating words are being thoughtlessly spread as if they are the truth, he wrote.)
The story took an even darker turn when a man named Joo Won-kyu came forward. A Methodist pastor, Joo had worked for a decade with runaway teenagers in Gangnam. Around 2016 he noticed that many of them, particularly girls, were dropping out of contact. He eventually traced several to nightspots where they were working as hostesses, often with fake IDs because they were underage. To learn more he got work delivering liquor and fixing equipment at clubs, including the venue that later became Burning Sun. He alleged that the clubs employed scouts to seek out attractive female runaways. After a few months of above-board tasks, he claimed, the women would be offered up, sometimes dosed with the date-rape drug GHB, to wealthy guests.

Its a culture of sex trafficking by elites, Joo, whos since become a prominent advocate for stricter enforcement of sexual assault laws, said in an interview. He described Gangnam, where K-pop idols and executives rub shoulders with South Koreas wealthiest and most connected citizens, as a male-dominated society that treats women as disposable. The idol system, he said, has contributed to this culture. A lot of K-pop idols train from age 9. When they gain some success and popularity, they become like kings.

The Burning Sun scandal wasnt embarrassing for K-pop only because it touched the third rail of sex. It also showed the industry losing some of its ultimate currency: control. K-pops most important actors are management companies, which serve as talent agencies, record labels, and concert promoters. Even the biggest stars are effectively employees, paid a share of revenue and expected to hit targets for output, touring, and publicity.

The system has been likened to a series of factories, but it also shares characteristics with medieval guilds. Idols typically sign contracts for seven years, an eternity in a profession where 30 is the age limit for marketability. (Decade-plus contracts used to be common.) Almost all performers begin as traineesapprentices who spend several hours a day drilling in singing, dancing, and what might be loosely called comportment. Once they reach adolescence, management companies assemble the most promising ones into groups, which rehearse for another year or two before their public debut.

Executives mold each groups musical style to the fashions of the moment. Many of the most successful songs are composites, combining rap, electronica, and even reggae with catchy hooks and choruses sung partly in English. Since K-pop went international in the early years of the millennium, rapidly displacing Cantopop, a fading Hong Kong export, management companies have shifted more lyrics into English and integrated foreign trainees into the idol systemmainly from the Korean diaspora, but also Thailand and China.

Its not hard to see why management companies like the factory model. Having a reserve of highly trained performers makes one of the critical anxieties of Western labelsscouting acts and signing them before rivals doa nonissue. If executives believe the next big trend will be hip-hop or mixed boy-girl groups, they simply assign their trainees accordingly. In theory, idols replaceability and rigid contracts make them easier to control than Western stars. No one can fire Justin Bieber, but every K-pop idol has a boss.

The system has plenty of critics. Feminist groups have condemned the industrys treatment of women, who are often paid less than male peers and confined to an even narrower physical and behavioral tightrope. Female stars who defy these expectations are subject to vicious digital harassment, sometimes with tragic results: In October the well-known singer Sulli, whod spoken frankly about mental health challenges and tested some of the industrys other taboos, died in an apparent suicide after years of online criticism. Some idols have sued their managers, claiming to have been deprived of almost all the financial gains they generated. While some performers write their own songs, its rarely a priority to foster creativity or unique voices. The aim is to mimic, tweak, or combine formulas.
The ingredients are prepared in places such as DSP Medias trainee school. A midsize management company on a narrow street in northern Gangnam, DSP hasnt been involved in any of the recent scandals. Its school has nine male and three female trainees, who practice from midafternoon until the late evening five days a week, then put in more hours on weekends. Its less grueling than it sounds, at least by local standards. Korean students spend more time studying than their counterparts virtually anywhere in the world; if the trainees werent doing this theyd likely be putting in similar time at so-called cram schools.
On a recent Friday afternoon, four of DSPs male trainees filed into a mirrored rehearsal room in T-shirts, loose black track pants, and sneakers, bending over to stretch their calves and hamstrings. An instructor cued upWave, a dancehall-style track by the boy group ATEEZ. The students began a polished routine, lip-syncing lyrics as they went through tightly synchronized moves that offered only a brief opportunity for each boy to strut his stuff. It was hard, athletic work, but they seemed to be having fun, smiling and joking when the music stopped.

Afterward the boys and one of their female peers gathered to discuss how theyd come to the business. When I was watching TV as a young girl, I thought those idol groups looked so good, and I wanted to become like them, said a 15-year-old trainee. Her motivations, though, were more material than artistic. My goal is to buy my parents a house, she said with a giggle.
Next to her, another trainee, Song Jae-won, cast his ambitions in terms perhaps never heard in the history of American record labels. My biggest hope is to please my parents, he said. One of the oldest of the group at 18, with braces on his teeth and silver hoops in both ears, Song is the closest to grappling with the dilemmas of stardom, if all goes well. As an idol, he said, it will be a little bit stressful to keep trying to have a clean image. Ill think about how to deal with that stress once I reach that level.

Asked about the recent scandals, he laughed nervously. Two instructors were sitting in, and the students appeared to know they were on touchy terrain. This systematic process is good, Song said. Im establishing my ethics, getting guidelines.

On a postcard-perfect evening in late August, a few dozen women gathered with placards and a microphone in a concrete plaza near Seoul City Hall. Not long before, members of South Koreas feminist movement had begun holding weekly protests, each time highlighting a different issue. This installment was focused on violence. At intervals, attendees repeated a simple, angry chant: Stop the deaths of women! Some held signs bearing the names of murder victims. We cant help but get furious, organizer Son Moon-sook bellowed from a small stage. The government has neglected assaults against women. We came out here today to urge the police, prosecutors, the courts, and the government, who are ignoring the deaths of women, to come up with effective responses.
More than half of Korean homicide victims are female, one of the highest rates in the world. Government statistics show that sexual assault and harassment are widespread, though fear of stigmatization means few go public with their experiences. (So far, the only women to speak out about alleged abuse at Burning Sun have done so anonymously.) Women who do make public accusations are frequently sued for defamation, and tropes about victims complicity in their own attacks remain commonplace. Alcohol is sometimes cited as a mitigating factor in court, with defendants arguing successfully for reduced sentences because they were intoxicated at the time of an assault. Blaming victims by saying, Why did you dress like that? or Why didnt you run away? are still big barriers to women taking action, says Park Hye-young, an associate director at the Seoul Sunflower Center, which assists victims.

On most metrics of economic equality, the country performs appallingly. South Koreas gender pay gap is the largest by far among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Itsdead laston theEconomists glass-ceiling index, an annual ranking of 29 developed countries friendliness to female workers. Theres also a well-organized mens rights movement, and polls suggest males are broadly skeptical of feminist policies.

The Moon government has tried to improve the situation for women, passing legislation to toughen penalties for workplace harassment and increase protections for victims. Its also encouraged police to crack down on spycams, initiating several high-profile prosecutions. (In March two men were arrested on suspicion of operating a website thatlive-streamed from inside hotel rooms, using cameras hidden in wall sockets and appliances.) Womens groups have tried to keep attention on the entertainment industry. Protesters frequently cite Jang, the actress who committed suicide, as a sort of martyr. At the height of the Burning Sun revelations, they staged a march to the club. What happens after dark in a rarefied part of Seoul might seem like a relatively contained issue, but activists argue that celebrities behaviorand the images of women the entertainment industry promoteshave an outsize impact on the larger culture.
Politicians seem to share the desire to clean up K-pop, though its possible theyd settle for keeping misbehavior out of the headlines. Successive governments have put music at the heart of asoft-power strategythat seeks to position South Korea as Asias cultural leader, and theyve had considerable success. The boy band BTS, K-pops most successful act, is a true global phenomenon, repeatedly topping U.S. charts and releasing collaborations with Steve Aoki, Nicki Minaj, and other Western performers. In his 2019 New Years address, Moon praised BTS and the music industry for getting foreigners wildly excited about Korean culture.
One of the striking things about the Burning Sun scandal, however, is how little the flood of revelations has affected K-pops operations. The industrys response has been not so much introspection as cauterization. Although Seungri could be prosecuted on as many as seven charges, and other performers have retired after scandals of their own, few K-pop executives or idols have so much as acknowledged the turmoil. There have been no organized demands for better behavior from male stars or serious discussions about revamping how idols are trained.

The main impact of Burning Sun, says Jeong Changhwan, a former SM executive whos now at entertainment conglomerateCJ ENM Co., will be as a cautionary tale. Its a huge lesson in what not to do, he says. The best teacher for young idols is to see fellow idols get into a scandal and disappear from the industry. And they do disappearYG Entertainment has already updated Big Bangs website, removing Seungri from the groups official portrait.
For everyone else, the show goes on. Before a recent taping ofM Countdown, a popular weekly broadcast in which rising idol acts compete for viewers votes, heavily made-up performers milled around adjusting their costumes and playing with their phones. As the start time approached, the members of a girl group watched playback of their rehearsal on a large monitor, checking their moves for synchronization. A female singer with purple hair, a powder-blue long-sleeve T-shirt, and cut-off black jean shorts looped with silver chains paced the hallway, her wardrobe calculated to signal rebellion without transgression.

The procession of performances began: 10 boys with perfectly calibrated rips on their otherwise pristine jeans, 6 girls in high school chic, 5 boys and an ovoid mascot that could have been the love child of Jessica Rabbit and Casper the Friendly Ghost. In the next weeks, dozens more would hit the stage, the latest products from an assembly line of artifice. No one in K-pop is indispensable; no idol, no matter how popular, is bigger than the machine.",1,0

Ive more active on other music subs, and over there Ive seen best of the decade lists posted over and over. Were in that season right now, where nearly every major music publication is reviewing the decade as a whole. What I found a bit strange is the lack of non-English songs, and non-English albums on album lists. The one song Ive seen come up a couple times is Malamente by ROSALA but even that is light years away from Kpop. I think what Im trying to ask is, what songs do you guys think deserve to be remembered, and are on par with the type of stuff that ends up on those lists? Im a newbie but Id love to learn more.

921,2019-11-7,2019,11,7,0,dshjzo,Simon Cowell wants to Create British Version of Kpop (UK-pop) and BTS,futurelikemadao,1573052839,"**Side Note:** Kpop and BTS mentioned near the end of the the article. 

**My Thoughts:** 

Simon Cowell is CLEARLY in it for the $$$$$. He sees that Kpop is a growing and lucrative market, thus his desire to cash in on the Kpop wave hence the creation of ""UK-pop"" as he calls it. There's so many things wrong with this.

1. The term ""UK-pop"": The UK already has so much pop music (and varieties of music in general) that's heard globally, so why does he want to start a ""new music wave"" when  British pop music already exists. 
2. Cowell's treatment towards his signed/past artists: When his artists aren't receiving the results, he just abandons them and then attempts to recreate a record hit artist. Now he has a feud with Little Mix who thankfully left his label, about a TV series that both are launching next year. 
3.  The Search for 1D's replacement: Ever since the 1D members went solo, Cowell has been searching for ""The Next Boy Band to Take Over the World"". Cowell has created other TV series to do so. For example, he was a co-creator  of ""La Banda"" which is a singing competition to find a latino boy band. The winners of this show is CNCO, who are reminiscent of 1D  (5 good looking members, talented voices, appeals to teenage fans \[mostly girls\], etc.). I think there are other boy bands he tried to make big from his X Factor show. 
4. The Rise of BTS: Right now BTS are the ""Biggest Boy Band in the World"" and right now no other male K-pop group and western boy band are at BTS's level. BTS have a huge fandom, selling out stadium tours, have toured globally, won western awards, record number of albums sold, performing on western TV shows, UN speech, and most of all made a positive impact on their fan's lives by addressing everyday struggles. Cowell saw BTS's imminent rise and probably felt threatened that the boy band market will be taken over by any group but his own, let alone an Asian group. Most of all, he wants to REPLICATE BTS's success because he wants the money and the credit. However, BTS's rise came naturally and over time whereas, Cowell would want his artists to be an instant superstars. 
5. K-pop's Rise on the Music Scene: It took many years for K-pop to get to be more recognized globally, now all of a sudden Cowell wants to cash in on it. Where was he before it became big? Some western artists had some sort of involvement with K-pop prior to it's current success such as [Will.I.Am](https://Will.I.Am) (2NE1) or Akon (Wonder Girls) they recognized K-pop or were willing to collaborate despite K-pop's lack of popularity during their time. When Cowell states, ""Every group will be put together by us  just like One Direction, Little Mix and Fifth Harmony. Its people who represent Britains version of K-Pop. That was always our plan. Weve just brought it forward a bit.  Now that western groups aren't popping like in the 90's or early-mid 2000's , he wants to take advantage of the K-pop wave in order to have a slice of the market. Don't ride on the coattails of K-pop's success, he will forget about K-pop when his new boy band ""takes the world by storm"". GTFO.

These are my thoughts on this. I don't want music labels (specifically western) to create a boy band to end/take advantage of K-pop's success and throw K-pop under the bus. 

**Disclaimer:** I am not trying to sound condescending, these are my observations or vibes that I got from reading this article.",166,217

1076,2019-11-7,2019,11,7,19,dsvwnd,What are some examples of kpop songs that are heavily inspired by other songs?,TheExcitedLamb,1573122558,"Through the years, as a music producer, I've noticed some pretty clear examples of ""reference tracks"" used in kpop. 


Here are some examples:
(For some reason I can't link songs the proper way)

""Jopping"" Super M, is most likely based off of ""BOOM"" - Tisto. 

- they both start with a brass intro 
- BOOM moves onto a dissonant pitch up, while Jopping, moves onto a dissonant guitar part.
- they both have heavy g-house/Brazilian bass influence (so if you like the groove in Jopping, check those genres out)


Jopping: https://youtu.be/pAnK1y7qjuE

BOOM: https://youtu.be/tSJSVmfaMCs


""bon bon Chocolat"" - everglow is heavily inspired by ddu-ddu-ddu by Blackpink.
This one is not as easy to define imo, but nevertheless it has a lot of the same elements and general vibe.  You could do the same comparison to ""kill this love"" - blackpink

- A hard hitting verse with a single bass note held. 
- A melodic softer prechorus
-  a hard drop with a catchy melody.
- Basically just a lot of similar sounds were used in these. (In my opinion Bon Bon is definitely the most interesting and best of these productions)

Bon bon Chocolat: 
https://youtu.be/HvGql8HwOIM
Ddu ddu (do I even have to link this)
https://youtu.be/IHNzOHi8sJs

(Also that red velvet song, that sounds like a bad version of Sorry by Justin bieber, but I can't remember it's name)

That's my two best examples, but I'm curious about your discoveries.",65,1

In spite of the recent Produce scandal, I'd be lying if I said I still wasn't a fan of the series. If possible, I would still want for Mnet to make more seasons.

However, I would want them to make more seasons WITHOUT being snake-skined reptilian bastards who manipulate and ruin the dreams of hardworking youths. 

But no matter how I think about it, it's hard for me to come up with ways to keep the votes 100% national producer based while maintaining a sense of transparency without sacrificing the suspence of the show.

As we all know, part of what makes Produce Series Produce is the ranking reveals, and if people already can count the votes fairly, it won't be nearly as thrilling.

I've thought about having a third party involved to count votes, but even then, you never know if they can also be bribed. I feel like to be absolutely certain, viewers would need a way to keep track of the votes themselves without spoiling the suspence. 

What do you guys think?",39,1

The K-pop industry is so toxic. I am glad she was able to get out of there and make her own mark on the world.

Behind the Scenes 

Smith, N. *K-pop star consumed by depression and pressure of fame,not to friend reveals.* 2017. 

Nicola Smith touches on a devastating truth that struck the Korean music industry in 2017. SHINee, a popular boy group in Korea, the lead singer Jonghyun commited suicide December 18, 2017. The note read, It wasnt my responsibility to go against the world. It wasnt my path to become world famous. Its a miracle that I endured through it all this time. This is an unfortunate truth that surrounds the kpop industry more often than not. Up and coming kpop stars start off as trainees at ages as young as 8 years old. Now, of course the parent of the child has legal ramifications that minor is not accustomed to. Once, in the industry it is very hard to leave, almost impossible. Once in, stars face punishing training, intense competition, unrelenting scrutiny via social media, and are constantly under a magnifying glass. Kpop is known to the world as ever-smiling and impossibly photogenic young stars with impeccable choreographed dance routines. All of this doesnt come easily, there is an immense amount of presser on these young adults. Quoted by Benjamin Jeff The word idol itself gives the idea that they have to be perfect Unlike other music industries having a good voice or looking the part doesnt cut it anymore. To be an idol, you have to be perfect. You have to dance, sing, and look the part to even be considered. To no surprise, one can imagine the amount of stress and pressure someone within the or wanting to persue the K-Dream. After one gets training and boot-camp they still have to keep up the image as the fame increases. When a group becomes famous the stress and pressure close in from every direction. Take BTS for example, over 309 million people have listened to Boy with Luv ft. Halsey within the first month of its release. That popularity alone is stressful; to maintain an image, to keep the interest, and to entertain. 

*K-pop Sensation Amber Liu partners with Uplive USA: Amber Liu one of Kpops most internationally recognized artists.* 2019.

PR Newswire focuses on one of the most popular female Kpop stars who is now signed with Steel Wool Entertainment along with Hayley Kyoko. Amber rose to stardom in 2009, beginning her career as vocalist and rapper for f(x), a female kpop group. Amber is known for her candid personality and devotion to female empowerment. Amber holds a social media presence with her own YouTube channel and uses this as a window to spread and share messages. Unfortunately, Amber wasnt always popular with the K-industry. Most of the time groups from big companies like: SM Entertainment, 1theK, Big Hit Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment have a non-vocalized cookie cutter look that they want. Many music producing companies in the K-industry dont want to admit it, but many of their idols have undergone some sort of pimping to look the part of a K-idol. Korea is third on the list of the most plastic surgeries a year at 25% of women ages 20-40 have had at least one procedure. The normal height for a female k-star is around 162-166 cm and about 45-50 kg. (53 to 56 and 100lb to 115lb). This alone puts an immense amount of pressure to look the part, to extreme diet plans to starvation, dehydration, and collapse during training or concerts. One gruesome surgery that is used within the k-industry is the breaking of the femur bone that will later be treated for osteogenesis adding 3-6 inches after recovery. Verbalized by PR Newswire, female groups are almost expected to be feminine and boy groups to be cool and prince-like. The significance of this article was that Amber Liu goes against the grain. She dresses in boyish clothing and doesnt model the typical K-idol personality. Newswire makes it evident that this is a good thing. The reasons for Steel Wools recruitment was for that exact reason. Amber is showing the k-world that you dont need to fit the hold you can be your own. 

Joo, K. Oak, J. *K-pop Primer.* 2012.

Quoted by Kim Joo and Jessica Oak, Billboard Korea estimates that the Korean music industry grossed nearly $3.4 billion in the first half of 2012, and has increased 27.8% at about 729 million dollars. BTS currently holds the top spot for the most popular boy group in Korea. According to ET Bureau, BTS has changed the game for Kpop, growing net profits by 173% from 2016, reaching $24.5 billion. If the pressure was hard in 2017 then it must be unimaginable now. Recently another Kpop idol was lost in early October. Sulli, formally known as a past member of f(x), a girls kpop group. Given the recent passing information is still being collected. Her death was confirmed on October 14, cause listed as suicide. The pressures of being the face of a company holds its own weight, but the pressure doesnt let off. In 2015, like many k-starts, Sulli received a lot of social media belittling from her anti-fans, angry fans. I was under so much pressure. I often felt scared. I am exhausted, but no one listened to me, I felt like I was alone. Quotes like this surfaced in 2015. This is not the only k-star that feels this way, but in this industry if you are the weak link you werent made for the job. After Jonghyuns a watershed moment for K-pop came about, where fans and idols themselves were discussing mental health and calling for greater attention to the welfare of the performers. The topic cant be ignored especially after another passing of yet another idol.",1,1

1146,2019-11-8,2019,11,8,3,dt20pu,What are some albums that could be improved by an edited tracklist?,QustoMar,1573151917,"Something I notice pretty often in K-Pop is that a really good album is released, but because the tracklist ordering is strange there isnt a good flow while listening through. Or sometimes the order could just be better in general.

One album is the Rookie mini-album by Red Velvet. Personally I prefer to listen to it as:

1. Rookie
2. Happily Ever After
3. Talk to Me
4. Little Little
5. Last Love
6. Body Talk

I think like this the first five tracks have a very cohesive sound/story, like there is a very clear sound progression from hyper and fantasy, to slow ballad. Then Body Talk is sort of an epilogue, or just one last big song like in movie credits

Another album Ive tried to rearrange the songs of is the Lion Heart album by Girls Generation

1. Lion Heart
2. Show Girls
3. PARTY
4. Green Light
5. Paradise
6. One Afternoon
7. Talk Talk
8. Check
9. Sign
10. Fire Alarm
11. You Think
12. Bump It

Im not fully satisfied with this version but I tried to sort of group different sounds on the album and have good transitions between them, like the bright pop (1-5) -&gt; a slower middle (6-7) -&gt; electro pop with a bit of experimentation (8-10) -&gt; a hard hitting ending (11-12) (mostly just wanted to keep Bump It as the closer lol)",30,1

I've recently been introduced to how talented some of the individuals in ""idol groups"" are and have fallen hard for some of the voices on show.

I particularly like hearing them when they go solo or smaller units and perform on shows like King of Masked Singer and Immortal Songs, even going back a few years to the likes of ""Girl Spirit"" on JTBC. 

My question is simply this...

Do the production companies make audio recordings of these performances available to purchase? If so, where?

It's great being able to grab them from YouTube but all too often the ""reactions"" are inserted and whilst I could edit those parts out, I'd love to be able to purchase the actual recordings of the performances. 

If you would like some examples...

[Seunghee and YooA covering Taeyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HTagJH7iAA) (M Stage)
[Seunghee covering Whale Hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHxBrHUv71A) (King of Mask)  
[Kei covering something I don't know the title of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka3hj4B0X6E) (Immortal Song)   

I'd love to have all of Mamamoo's performances from IS too if I could buy them. 

I have very quickly fallen in love with performances like these from those within ""idol groups"", and in the case of the likes of Mamamoo and Oh My Girl, full group appearances on Immortal Songs but I can't find the majority on official streaming platforms so was hoping I could buy them instead. 

Can anyone help?",0,1

1370,2019-11-9,2019,11,9,15,dts8z3,WIZ*ONE As A Fandom Needs Change.,DEDICATEDWIZONE,1573280139,"No more. The members owe us nothing. If anyone failed, it's their corrupt management and the producers who rather suck up for a sum of money rather than do the right thing or have a sense of decency. If WIZ\*ONE fails to help them enough now, it's over.

Hastagging and making a fuss about when the next comeback is will no longer be enough. This new generation of Kpop idols was supposed to be the best generation so far but it is already the worst generation. There are already more scandals and controversies than the last two generations combined. I am about to put Kpop up onto my shelf after 11 years and probably will never take it up again if I do.

If this is how IZ\*ONE is going to end, it is the end of Kpop as a respectable job and form of entertainment since following a series of shakeups and busts in the industry. Kpop won't be seen as fun anymore.. Well, at least for me. So many people in the management positions try to want to script it worst than some reject of a pro wrestling company and I watch pro wrestling; I feel this is far worst. Supposed top stars are misusing fans' sincere money trying to start their own cartel or are just being indecent human beings.

Moreover, the people in Kpop absolutely suck! The saesangs, the weird fans who try hacking to expose some indecent pictures, the comment section trolls and the ingrates who complain without any real reason about the members but don't contribute to the greater good within the fandom! If people really wanna be in IZ\*ONE's fandom, they should behave like IZ\*ONE. Have some manners! Stop causing fights and real life dramas at every event like KCON or a fan meeting, stop being toxic to other fandoms and stop trying to make airports demonstration areas while trying to get an autograph to sell on Ebay cos you're too lazy to get a real job. Think about how someone you know would react if they found out. It happens, it really does. Someone actually went to jail for malicious comments recently.

I'm done with Kpop completely if IZ\*ONE ends like this. I am still staying now only because it is the 12 of them and I love all of them because everyone has earned my love, my money, my time and my effort. People who left this fandom or have stopped supporting because of the recent news are just fake to begin with. They were never in it for the 12 of them as individuals with their own unique personalities; They were in it for the hype, their good looks or some other stupid reason or earthly desire. The biggest change we need is we need to start having a sense of pride and responsibility. So until the end, let's just work our best. Keep voting, keep showing up and keep sending love.

Because for now, I officially quit everything related to Kpop except for IZ\*ONE!!

I think it would be a cool experience to possibly follow my dreams and for other people to do so too. Some idols went to music academies before becoming trainees and these training camps are like that but aimed more towards an international market. Theres an increased success rate because of the singing/dancing training, korean lessons, and audition tips they give. Also most have closed auditions with partner companies which give people a better chance at becoming trainees too. What do you all think of training camps? Are they worth it? Are they scamming international people? Do you think people who go to these academies get accepted into companies after?",4,1

There's a girl who take an exam to get into college, learning as much as she can do, and then she got in without knowing it's because her parent bribe the organizer.  


**one year later, she become one of the best student in their university, have a great GPA, participate in many event, have a good friend, good altitude, and never did a big mistake.**  


**Then the university started to know this girl not suppose to get in.**

if we are the president of this univ  


**Question**  
1. Should we kick this girl out ? should we put the ""supposed"" girl to get into university without knowing the ""supposed"" girl will doing better or not ?  
2.then later we find out (hopefully not) the girl was already known and participate with their parent to bribed  


**My answer**

1. It's too late, and she doing well, she also doesn't know, i will let her stay  
2. I will curse her ! block her from any scholarship, fellowship and other university program. But i will let her stay to learn until she graduated, if people ask why you let her ? my answer is because she already prove me she doing great. I'm not sure any university would like to accept this girl later if i kick her out. I dont wanna destroy her future and give her second chance. But i will give her a harsh warning, if i'm find out you cheat again after i let you stay, without a doubt i will kick you out !

Instead of giving out awards for the ""best of K-Pop"", these awards will be for the strangest, funniest, and downright worst of K-Pop in 2018.

The voting and nominations take place on r/kpoppers in February every year. We've been late this year due to constant scandals and other projects which have taken the moderators time. We're slowly catching up.

This is the first time this award is posted on r/kpop. Let us know what you think. The 3rd Annual Razzie Awards will be posted on r/kpoppers in February. 

Let's get to it!

Only a few songs seem to have truly smashed, like Dalla Dalla, Boy With Luv etc. Otherwise, Korean charts have been dominated by ballads, blocking even the biggest names from the top. It's felt very noticeable

I'm really interested to see what people think! Is the Korean general public maybe losing interest in idol music and the ""k-pop sound"" and will this trend continue in the future? Could it be argued the music just isn't as good as it once was? There's definitely been some polarising releases this year",37,1

1537,2019-11-10,2019,11,10,23,duc913,Why is the universally hated group Super Junior?,kyriosdominus,1573396918,"Kang In obviously is the epitome of stupidity having two DUIs &amp; multiple scandals while intoxicated. 

The ""sexist holy trinity"": Leeteuk, Yesung, &amp; Shindong. Members that have outrageously spoken about their view on overweight women. 

Leeteuk's allusion to drunk sex. (I don't consider this a rape joke, far from it actually. It was just a bad joke for a very conservative country.)

I find Eunhyuk's previous fiasco with IU mysteriously funny but I didn't particularly care about that.

The others are just stupidly overblown it's funny.

However, I find it quite alarming that they (the group) are the only ones who are immediately received with negativity when mentioned. It'd be understandable if they were the only ones who had ever made the remarks but they weren't. Is it because they are influential? But other, well known groups have also said &amp; done controversial things that are relatively forgotten (except the recent happeninga, obviously).",3,1

I mean, we see pop groups release new stuff every two months but to actually get to listen to new material from Lee Hi, I had to wait a year after she nearly got dropped from her label even though she had a n1 album.",6,1

A place to talk about new and/or underrated Kpop groups/soloists/bands and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to the last full Nugu Roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dr61e1/nugu_roundup_17_aint_no_montn_high_enough_20191103/).  

This week we're going to take a closer look at one of the groups I included in the first ever Nugu Roundup post.  Since they've just had a comeback and released their first EP, let's get to know my favorite new group of 2019, BVNDIT!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**BVNDIT**

**Who are they?:**  A five member girl group under MNH Entertainment

**Company:** MNH Entertainment was founded in 2014 by an ex-JYPE executive and featured Chungha as its first artist.  BVNDIT is the first and only group under the company, though they also have a rolling open online audition process.

**Introductions:**  Since BVNDIT doesn't have to appeared on the de rigueur nugu interview program 'Pops in Seoul' here are some links to get to know them:

**Trivia:**  Chungha was considered for a position in the group before the decision to take her solo instead was made.  The BVNDIT fandom name 'BVNDITBUL' means 'firefly'.  The group has said that Mamamoo and BtoB are their role models and inspirations as performers.  Songhee has been with MNH the longest, and is technically Chungha's senior with the company if you include trainee time.  They've been nominated for Artist of the Year, Best New Female Artist, and Worldwide Fans' Choice Top 10 in the upcoming MAMA awards.

All three members were PD101X contestants, and their leader Sihun was originally considered for positions in groups in YG as well as in AB6IX.  There's a possibility Eunsang, who's currently a member of the X1 produce group, may join as fourth member after X1's contract expires.

**Kprofiles:** [Info Link](https://kprofiles.com/sha-sha-members-profile/)

**Active Between:** February 27th, 2018 and July 17th 2019

**Reason for disbandment:** Although they didn't quite make it to a full year and a half as a group they had a bit of turmoil and lost three members, replacing them with three more during their debut year.  Their disbandment may have been due to their company running out of money, the Major Entertainment website now just shows a picture of a soccer stadium with the message 'Coming Soon' and all of Sha Sha's social media accounts and YouTube channel have been deleted.

**Trivia:** It seems their company may have had some sort of relationship with NH Media, home of Laboum, but it's hard to find many details.  Their lead vocalist Go Woon had a bit of bad luck in terms of groups - having previously been a member of VIVIDIVA, which disbanded in less than a year, and having been slated to become a member of a group called Twinkle, which disbanded before debut.",45,1

1642,2019-11-11,2019,11,11,16,duos5l,"Fan Account: KAMP Singapore Day 1 20191109 - GFRIEND, Alexa, Ha Sung Woon, Chungha, NCT127",barurutor,1573455925,"After seeing the big 3 GGs (Twice, Red Velvet, Blackpink) live over the past year, figured KAMP Singapore Day 1 would be good to check out GFRIEND with bonus Chungha and repeat NCT127 with the Mrs. No expectations for Ha Sung Woon or Alexa

Venue was the Singapore Indoor Stadium, same venue used by Blackpink &amp; Twice during their Singapore performances. Upon entry we got synchronized light-up bracelets, a nice bonus souvenir. Venue wasn't packed full, but healthy attendance nonetheless.

GFRIEND started off the night with Fingertip and did 7 songs including Navillera, a great orchestral vocal-only rearrangement of Rough, and closing with Fever and Time For The Moonlight. The girls did well but came off as a bit reserved compared to the acts that followed or their own variety show appearances. TFTM live showed off their precision choreography and the vocal only Rough performance (no choreo, just 5 mic stands and them standing at rest) let them shine vocally as well.

Minor sidebar: the same interpreter for Red Velvet and Twice translated this concert. Lady must be making bank considering how frequent K-Pop acts come to Singapore. Her translations are beginning to sound a bit same-y though.

Alexa (the American ex-Produce48 contestant turned solo idol) came next, and won over the audience with her infectious energy. Performing her debut single Bomb and 2 BG dance covers (MonstaX Dramarama &amp; B.A.P. Warrior), she surprised the crowd with powerful moves. Her ment game was on point, praising the local food and architecture and getting the audience hyped by pitting different sections in a cheering loudness contest. Short (seriously, she was smol but built like a gymnast) but memorable, she definitely left a good impression on Singapore K-Pop fans.

Ha Sung Woon kept the energy up with 6 songs (BIRD, Tell Me I Love You, Don't Forget, Bluemaze, Blue, What Are You Doing Today?!) from his solo discography, alternating between playful and precise choreographies with smooth vocals all throughout.

God Chungha snapped onto the stage with Snapping and finished with a  [Bang] Bang! I'd seen her perform last March in Taiwan with a virtually Identical set of Gotta Go, Rollercoaster, Why Don't You Know, and Jessie J's Bang Bang and receive pretty much the same response of deafening cheers and applause from the audience. Overwhelming swag and sexiness (always classy) while performing and her English voice is lovely to hear. Definitely would try to see her perform again when the opportunity arises.

Minor Sidebar #2: GFRIEND and Chungha opted to use handheld microphones while Alexa &amp; NCT127 used headsets. Ha Sung Woon alternated between headset/mike depending on the song.

Final act for the night NCT127 performed their hits (Fire Truck, Cherry Bomb, Regular, Superhuman) along with a couple of cool b-sides (Replay (PM 01:27) and Touch). At this point they're like familiar friends, having seen them 5 times in total in 3 different countries (Philippines, Japan, and Singapore). Touch and Replay (PM 01:27) were new to me but not to the numerous NCTzens present. Pleasantly surprised that Taeil spoke really good English during the ment.

Overall the concert was very good mix of old &amp; new performances from familiar faces, and a rookie to watch. A fine way to end this year of attending K-Pop concerts.",4,1

1723,2019-11-12,2019,11,12,0,duu0vh,Any other straight male fans find it difficult branching out into boy groups due to song content in a lot of their music?,LeafNinjaPanda,1573486662,"Hi all, first off sorry if the title seemed a bit non-inclusive but I'm hoping to get answers from people who are in the exact same position as me although any/all responses regardless of gender or sexuality are appreciated:)


So the title I think sets the stage pretty well here, I've been listening to k-pop for about 2 years now. My initial contact with k-pop came through BlackPink (surprise surprise haha) and I vibed with them right away which was a huge surprise to even myself as it was unlike anything I usually listened to (that being at this point underground rap) but nonetheless something clicked and I thought it slapped. As time went on I broadened my horizons a bit started looking at other groups such Twice, Red Velvet, GFriend. But not to drag the story on basically I stuck to girl groups scared by the stigma (which appears to not be entirely false but perhaps more just overly exaggerated) that boy groups were aimed at teenage girls. Very recently though I wanted to leave the safety of my girl groups and venture into boy groups and I found NCT.


Now again I found myself really surprised as I liked most of their songs with MV's (I say most as NCT Dream in general didn't really click with me) anyway diving deeper into their catalogue I noticed and I'm sure this is different for every group but I struggled as a guy to find other songs I felt I could really enjoy. A lot of them by the end I was left thinking ""That was alright not sure I'd listen to it again though"" others made me feel downright uncomfortable to a certain degree such as what I now know as ""The infamous kinky sister song - Whiplash"" and I know I could just not listen to the ones that aren't my taste and I probably will do that but a lot of the time the lyrics end up being the dealbreaker while the song and singing itself I'm all for.

So I'm curious if other male fans feel this sort of segregation/invisible barrier to boy groups or if k-pop fans in general feel there is this divide  because of song content that can make branching out quite difficult. Perhaps I'm just speaking from a space of naivety as I'm still in the baby steps of exploring boy groups but I'm interested to hear everyone's opinions and thoughts on the matter.",13,1

The song sounds amazing, the choreography looks amazing (as soon as it goes up Im learning it) their outfits are stunning. It honestly might be the best MAMAMOOS comeback because it looks so great.

So after watching it a million times o think its gonna have some symbolism based on real world issues. In some shots (the ones with wheein in the red jumpsuit type thing) theres signs that says stuff about pollution and she looks to be starting a riot maybe. And heads looks to be the president too.

(week 64),ThisGuyKpops,1573491086," Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song per person a week. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. For time sake, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So no live, remix, or free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating
5. I translate on Thursday. So I would prefer last request be on Wednesday midnight. = P

As requested by kpop reddit, I am currently working on Bolbbalgan4 Profile. Until then, you can look at my latest one.

I think first society needs to change and I don't mean to sound offensive but the elder generations need to die out. 
I think this change will be faster than we think due to globalization but long lasting change also needs time.
Before idols come out or are accepted into companies as openly gay other people of the entertainment industry need to come out. 
I think it will be comedians, entertainers, influencers and maybe even actors before idols.
Even the kpop industry is changing fast and rapidly so maybe this is going to happen sooner than we expect. 
There's also a huge target market as a big amount of kpop are LGBT themselves at least internationally and it seems like kpop in general is moving internationally lately. 

I think in about a decade or so we will see the first gay pop idols being normalized and achieving success.",5,1

#November 12, 2019


##Police are now also investigating Produce X trainees

This includes trainees who had their agencies raided by the police and trainees who were expected to debut and did not make it into the final line up. The police will likely ask the trainees if they heard anything about the scandal during the filming of the show or if they heard it being discussed in their own agencies before shooting began. In addition, as opposed to allegations of companies simply raising the rank of trainees, the police will investigate a wide variety of possibilities, such as scenarios where agencies purposefully lower the ranks of their own trainees in fear that these trainees will not be able to promote within their own label.

##The Police held a briefing today to address some of their progress in the investigation.

They have booked a total of 10 people so far and are investigating all seasons, not just 48, and X. (As well as other shows) This also includes the 4 people who were given arrest warrants previously, and CJ ENM employees

Although there's a whole bunch of genre that guarantees success, some groups could try something very foreign and different. Directors of music videos could produce an okay-quality music video but there's always some mvs that simply impresses the audience. Some groups even have their own lore and hide secrets in music videos, lyrics, trailers, etc.  
Concerts? Being together in a place with your fav artists is cool, but the concert production also makes that moment memorable and enjoyable.

Popularity and beautiful/handsome faces don't make a group 'artistic', so please exclude that in the discussion.

Question for those who were also massive fans of other groups or artists in the past (1D, JoBros, MCR, BSB, Hanson, hell, the Beach Boys, whoever), does your love for your top kpop group feel different? Why?

((background info. I'm a writer and I'm working on a novel that is meant to address some of these questions in a way to legitimize how we interact with art, even when society at large deems certain things too ""commercial"" to be considered art. The story deals with several other things, including neurodivergence, grief, and magic. I would like to start a conversation for conversation's sake and have no intention of using anyone's story verbatim. If there is a particular comment that strikes a chord for me, I'll reach out to you to see if you'd be open to discussing further.))",78,1

Fake Mamamoo YT Channel is Attempting to Steal Viewership,AlhazenTheMad,1573638804,"There is a fake Mamamoo YT channel that just recently started activity. It is attempting to steal/alter viewership count and confuse viewers just right before Mamamoo's comeback drops on 11/14/19, possibly in an attempt to impact music chart results, etc. The first video it posted was the title track Hip MV (even though the real MV has not come out yet). Seeing as how it is no longer there... It was probably successfully taken down due to user reports. However, the channel is continuously uploading more videos in order to continue stealing viewership. The name of the channel is almost identical to the official Mamamoo channel (except without the music note after it). The channel's description and links are also trying to emulate the descriptions and links from real official channel. You can also see in the fake channel's 'About' tab that they also have a fake subscription count of roughly 2.1mil that roughly coincides with the actual subscription count from the official Mamamoo channel.

And you guys already know IZONE is in an expected crisis.

CJ and mnet manipulated vote results in the Produce 48, the tv program.

But as you know, this is not their fault, but the guilty of PDs, some staffs, and some senior management.

Their new album was supposed to be released on the 11th.

Though I just watched a teaser, all the songs was great.

I'm sure that you will like it.

Anyway,  many fans are looking forward to their come-back and want to be of any help to them.

#PREFACE:
This write-up is really important to me since Jay Park has never came to Toronto for 4 years and this is probably the last one for this year.

#Pre-Concert

-	Compared to AOMG concert, I was bit late arriving to venue (haha responsibilities). I lined up around 5-ish pm and the meet and greet people were supposed to arrive 6:00 pm

-	I dont know if it was due to being late, but security were less stringent. I came prepared with I.D and everything, there were less involvement with staff so it was less hostile. Lines were more organized and people didnt really push when nearby.

#Phase 1 - MEET &amp; GREET

-	To be honest, the process was really quick. Staff didnt care if you wanted to be together, they just counted six people which was less hassle to be honest

-	I got to meet Hoody first and damn she was stunning. I was really scared but she approached first saying nice to meet you and that made me feel relieve. She just has that power to make you feel that warm and smooth inside, it was unreal. Still, I replied back with thanks for making great music.

-	Honestly, I was starstrucked when I met Jay Park next. Like this man has been giving me feels since he was the one who introduced me to K-hiphop and R&amp;B so he really played a big role in shifting my music taste.

-	I said to him  Thank you for making great music then he replied  I really appreciate it bro. I never expected to be addressed as bro would be that impactful tbh it was crazy how mixed my emotions were when I experience it.

-	When I went to do coat check, they re-appeared in the venue walking towards backstage to prepare. Hoody waved at me and I said to her Good luck and she replied Thank You. Man i never expected to feel so happy with simple things


#Phase 2- Intro

-	It was same DJ who performed around 8:30 pm. show was (8:00-10:30). TBH, i really prefer his performance from AOMG because the visuals in the screen really complemented the music. As well as the bass of sound were more compelling that I still get chills today.

-	Nonetheless, It was still really nice because it was mostly remix of Jay Park songs which acted as a nostalgia but a build to hype 

-	New artist from H1GHR MUSIC tried to build hype for intro and performed for 30 minutes named AVATAR DARKO. Lets just leave it at he was ok, maybe I really didnt feel it because he was new or unknown to me


#Phase 3 - Concert

-	So when Jay Park came, everyone went livid. Idk if it was because everyone had to wait for 4 years to wait for his performance but man the pushing was crazy. 

-	In positive light, there were really dedicated fans. In negative light, the pushing was insane. What made it worse, is the space youre left with in vicinity, there was no legit space. I had to be compressed and at a weird sideway angles the whole stage. It was rare for me to put my hands down.

-	When Jay Park came with the legendary I hear a cha cha beat boy intro, everyone lost their shit and i mean literally. I had no choice but I had to be pushed forwards and backwards for 5 times.

-	The pushing kept happening for his recent/popular songs  and really evident in my fancams. Honestly, whoever in the future is going, you need mental preparation because I was not ready for it. I went to 20+ concerts so far and this was the epitome of pushing and feeling space invaded.

-	Im really surprised of how versatile his setlist was to be honest and the range of years. It was amazing to see the progress and other side of his music.

-	A nice bonus was dance covers incorporated and some performance was really incorporated with these intricate and slick moves. Not only he is a good rapper, singer but a great performer. His energy was really consistent throughout the whole stage and I dont even know how because damn. 

-	It was barely noticeable struggle of breathing but man there is just something about his vibes that makes him really stand out and just be Jay Park.

-	The backup dancers are really hot and talented to be honest, it was such a nice compliment to his dance-based songs and accentuated the performance to a whole new level. Props to them 

-	If you search sexy in the dictionary, Youll find Jay Park. Damn his moves are lethal and oozing with that fc. boi vibes. He really brings everything when performing snd whenever he sings a song you can really feel it

-	He also performed his collaboration with Hoody which is Solo and man, their voices complimented so well. Hoody vibes seems so laidback but she still have this like cool aura. Man her voice is so smooth and nice to listen to

-	Also Jay, this man kept unbuttoning one button in each performance, this man is a tease. Everyone kept saying each performance take it off. When people said it at the beginning performance take it off, he replied with its too early for that.

-	He also kept poking fun of his shirt not being wrinkled but its a design lol. this man has great humour too


-	I talked about how he covered many eras, he transition into his hiphop songs and man he was wilding. He wore a raptors jersey this time too.

-	Lastly, the obligatory hoe anthem mommae performance, everyone lost their shit when he strip half-naked and man this guy can twerk for life too. There was just so much hype and his songs always becomes legendary.

-	At this point, people kept throwing bras and complimented people how they have really good throwing skills lol

-	When he did encore, he sang Birthday and ask if anyones birthday tonight. This guy is legendary for mixing it up with 50 cent In Da Club. Hoody also came back to perform with him

-	Then lastly, the obligatory second hoe anthem, Watercame and he kept asking people if they know H1GHR too. man it was crazy to experience both version from Sik-K and Jay Park i felt blessed

-	To be honest, I left much earlier (15 min) because it was just too much to feel stuck for a long time with pushing. People skipped coat checks and there was no AC so it was really hot. PRO TIP is if you cant take it anymore, never force yourself to stay. Its not worth it.

I'm really proud of how they're themselves and proud of show themselves off. Also their choreo isn't the toughest yet its catchy and finally haters can shut up about them having easy dances. 
I'm yet to listen to the entire album. But i heard a few songs. Here's my opinions thus far-

Hip- love the guitar sounds, the chorus is catchy. Moonbyul has way more lines and wheein has experimented with a new vocal style which i love. 

Destiny- such a serve. Strong vocals. Has the mamamoo feel but nothing like anything they've made before. I personally enjoyed Solar's vocals a lot in it. 

What are your opinions in the album? Which one is your favourite track so far?",2,1

(2010-2015),sadnoodlesalad,1573823442,"I can't remember the name of this song and it's frustrating me beyond the point of belief. I only remember the music video. It is sung by, I think a male and female co ed kpop group (it might be jpop idk)))and this particular song features another male Asian rapper. 

The music video is video game themed. 

The music video starts with a bunch of people in a white room watching a TV. It zooms into the TV and shows the singers in a pixelised form. It then proceeds to have the real life singers and it plays out a story, where the girl loses her heart's (displayed at the top of the screen)  as the male flirtS with other girls. It then cuts to the featuring male rapper and they're like all dancing and then the video ends with it zooming back out from the TV to the white room. 
The video is really unique and colourful 

The main hook of the song is literally 'nananananana ' here's the chorus https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/song/4726296238096384 (sorry for the whack tempo) 

Pleaassse can someone help, this song has been stuck in my head for like a year and I can't find",1,1

Ever since then I've been exploring on my own different groups that I like. Currently, I'm now an SM stan and there's one thing I realized about them.

If a song is from SM, the chorus is most likely sung by the entire group. Some examples from the top of my head include: Tempo, Jopping, Bad Boy, Boss, We Go Up, Take Off. Even 2nd gen such as Gee, Mr Simple, Everybody. The only song I know that has only one member singing the chorus is 'I Can't Stannd The Rain"" by SuperM where the reason behind this is because only Baekhyun can reach those high notes.

What do you guys think?",86,1

""Blackpinks star may still be rising in the U.S., but on YouTube, it reigns supreme: the foursomea.k.a. Jisoo, Jennie, Ros and Lisahas 31million subscribers, more than any other music group in the world. This year, Blackpink also became the first K-pop girl group to perform at Coachella, heralding a new era of Korean acts stepping past language barriers to play global stages. Blackpinks success has been powered in part by a devoted legion of digitally savvy fansin this case, Blinkswho, among other things, helped its flashy Ddu-Du Ddu-Du music video reach 1billion streams. The groups goal, they say, is to make music that helps listeners gain confidence and boldness. *Kat Moon*

So what are you guys' favorite Celebration themed songs in kpop? (doesn't have to be halloween like I mentioned above; Wonder if there's a chuseok inspired song out there or even birthday songs. Covers are cool too; I want someone to cover Nightmare Before Christmas lol)

My personal picks are (Sorry if it's long  been thinking about this since last week):

* [Holiday By snsd](https://youtu.be/YwN-CN9EjTg) (Of course)
* [Voodoo Doll By Vixx](https://youtu.be/MOG7BexjPjM) (2019 and this MV is still intense as fuck)
* [Christmas in Summer By OMG](https://youtu.be/TTW7Nc45VkI) (Just had to)
* [April Fools \[0401\] By Park Jimin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfkEbtHcooI)
* [Married to the music By Shinee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcu7yZBeSKw)
* [Zombie Party By SPEED](https://youtu.be/v9EyUuco218)
* [Joy By NCT Dream](https://youtu.be/VMMl0DopcdM)
* [Wish List By f(x)](https://youtu.be/6VsKb7Nb6xU)
* [Timing By WM family](https://youtu.be/y2BwMqpGzC8) (then again, I enjoy most obligatory company Christmas releases)
* [A Typical Trainee's Christmas By BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpRZUgWgeXw) (Every trainee's anthem)
* [All I want for Christmas is you Cover By OMG](https://youtu.be/SbnOY5R38cE) (I just had to again; this is just wholesome fun tho--I also love [Monsta X's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiJSEqrxopU) of this too--maybe a little bit more actually.)
* [Twilight By OMG](https://youtu.be/n31-1D5tQeI) (3rd times the charm)
* [Remember Me By OMG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrvdjyIL0fA) (I had to, don't judge me, if it's New Years, it's this song)",40,1

I knew the tune and point choreo for *Sorry, Sorry* long before I actually listened to it. I was also aware of their notoriously crazy interactions and personalities as well. I became a fan with their latest comeback and I honestly love them now. 

But SuJu has been around for a *long time* and a lot has happened. So my question for E.L.F is this: what has it been like following a group for so long? You've seen them grow, gain popularity, go through hardships, and all go and come back from the military. In short, to me, it feels like you have witnessed to whole lifecycle of a boy group. What has that expirience been like as a fan?",1,1

Everyone got to showcase their talents and versatility, and it also helped them to gain new fans. If there were to be a second season of Queendom, what acts would you like to see on it? Personally, I would only want to see group acts. Putting a solo artist in the middle of a ton of groups is unfair, imo. Anyways, Id love to see the following on Queendom:

WJSN
EXID
GFRIEND
Gugudan
DIA
LOONA (international fans would go crazy) or ITZY

Whenever I see some of the sets for K-pop performances, I wonder how much time, effort, and money went into making them because they look so extravagant and detailed.

Here are some of my favorites:

[Palette- IU @ Inkigayo](https://youtu.be/qZjDnn50zRo): The set is insanely gorgeous.

[Spring Day- BTS @ Music Bank](https://youtu.be/YMiRkr6RXKo): I love how the lighting changes at the end to show how spring came.

[Lalalay- Sunmi @ Inkigayo](https://youtu.be/zB4XZbI0G4M): I like how the lighting goes psychedelic at the 1:02 drop. I think Sunmi has really pretty sets for most of her comeback stages.

\- Who's your bias wrecker and why? 

\- What's your favorite song?

\- Who is the most popular member amongst the fandom and in general?

My bias is definitely Hoshi, this guy is such an all-rounded idol! He has such a great presence on stage and he is sooo soft and sweet. My bias wrecker is definitely Joshua, he makes my heart melt with his charisma.

We've got some good projects coming up, so let's dive in.

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**E.O.S Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_eos_03)

Who is E.O.S?

* Date Project Ends: November 18, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

E.O.S (which stands for **E**xcuse **O**ur **S**urvival) was a three member [techno-rock band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQdSJRF5NEc) that debuted in 1993, with Kim Hyung Joong as an original member (and leader) of the group. The group was active from 1993 to 1997, when they disbanded after the release of their third album *Neo Myth of EOS*. After the group disbanded, Hyung Joong sort of disappeared from the industry, making the occasional guest feature on various tracks until the reception of Good Person on Toys 2001 project album convinced him to officially come back and debut as a solo artist. He officially debuted as a solo artist in 2003.

After a [successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_eos/)for their 25th Anniversary album (where they raised 186.13% above their goal), it seems that the group has decided to continue promoting as an active group. They ran [a second Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_eos_02/) which was similarly successful.

Although the other two original members Go Sukyoung and Kangrin are not involved, they have been replaced by Bae YoungJoon (on base) and Cho Samhee (guitar). Their credits include being a former member of 90s group Kona (Bae Youngjoon) and being bandmaster for Epik High (Cho Samhee).

[**AlphaBAT Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_alphabat_01)

* Date Project Ends: December 30, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is AlphaBAT?

Alphabat has, to put it mildly, a weird career trajectory since their debut. The group currently consists of five members and is currently signed to APB Entertainment (which might also go under W Entertainment?).

The group's name is a play on the English word ""alphabet"", and in a cool nod to its' Greek origins (*alphabtos),* the members' stage names are the names of the Greek letters in the alphabet.

The group's fanname is Alpha, due to it being the name of the first letter in the Greek alphabet.

The group officially debuted as a nine member group (Beta, Code, Delta, Epsilon, Fie, Gamma, Heta, Iota, Jeta) on November 14, 2013 with the song ""[AB City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO3gf--ipCc)"" and accompanying album of the same name.

However, in 2016 the group's SNS announced that group was leaving Korean label Simtong Entertainment and moving to Japanese label Jakol Corporation. This move caused the group to lose 5 members (Code, Delta, Fie, Iota, Jeta). The remaining four members added a fifth member (Kappa) to complete the new lineup under Jakol.

The group promoted as four members on and off due to enlistment throughout 2017, though reconvened as five members in 2018.

Sometime in 2017, the group moved labels again to W Entertainment/APB Entertainment, which is where they currently are.

The group's last comeback was ""[Fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70iFNFuoiYc)"" in September 2019, which was released as a digital single. This project is for their upcoming comeback, and first without member Epsilon due to enlistment.

Also, member Heta is kind of in a weird spot, he enlisted in 2017, but I haven't been able to find out whether he left the group or not since his enlistment should be done this year. I'm assuming he did, but if anyone knows anything more, please let me know!

Sometimes they don't work, like with Baekhyun's UN Village, which is good as it is. But sometimes, I find hidden treasures, like [NCT 127's Cherry Bomb](https://youtu.be/WkuHLzMMTZM) at 1.25x speed, which brings out the drums' beats.

[Discussion],fykidols,1574003013,"I saw that these HT were trending #NCTDREAMFIXEDUNIT #\_ about NCT Dream and part of me feels sad for the fans and part of me is laughing because Lee Soo Man will never make another fixed unit, at least not anytime soon. He is going to keep rotating guys through various groups because he knows no matter what fans are going to buy the albums and the merch. He started with NCT, pulled in EXO members for SuperM and despite all the protest fans are supporting. So fixed units are nowhere in the near future for SM boy groups. He is going to keep playing shuffle board with what members together can get him the bigger bang for his buck. 

EXO doesn't count because they were formed before he restarted this new experiment. He tried this experiment before with Super Junior but it didn't work out but now that kpop is more global than it was back then and times have changed, I think that is exactly what his future plans are. And I expect Mark &amp; Taeyong to be a part in some variation of most of those groups.

What do you think? Will SM keep shuffling round the boys in his company for the foreseeable future or will he make more permanent groups?",115,1

wait have u realised that SM might scold JS for crying bc now #DREAMFIXEDUNIT is trending although dream is a graduation system. SM might have to change their whole concept and marketing and behind the scenes would be hella chaotic.
As a NCTzen i want dream to be a fixed unit but I feel like they should Integrate more of Dream to 127 but it doesn't feel right.

Because I stan more boy groups but listen to more girl group songs, I usually do it male-to female. Which ones have you noticed? Please limit your answers to vocal colors only, not technique (rappers can also be included) I'm talking about ""oh, this idol sounds like that other idol, but male/female"". If you're particularly good at singing like me, you can ""impression-test"" the voices.

As a casual Orbit and a devoted STAY, I have to give Han and Chuu as an example. As evidenced by Chuu's role, I'm talking about vocalist Han here. Their high, bright and clear voices are basically counterparts of each other. Previously; I had matched OT12 EXO with Loona, member by member. I had assigned Chuu for Chen. However; after taking a closer listen to Han's voice, I realized his vocal color was very similar to that of Chuu. As for rapper Han, Yoojung from Weki Meki was close; but it still wasn't a complete match.

Side note: Their high notes in Neverending Story and Frozen have the same energy (complete with length and backing rap/poem from Hyunjin and Gowon respectively)",24,1

A place to talk about new and/or underrated Kpop groups/soloists/bands and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to the last full Nugu Roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dugscp/nugu_roundup_18_neato_bvndito_20191110/).

I've been wanting to do something on this group for a while, and their recent comeback prodded me into going for it.  They're a group that's flirted with breaking into the big time on a few occasions, but have somehow generally remained under the radar.  Today let's learn about Sunny Hill!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Sunny Hill**

**Who are they?:** Currently a four member girl group under BOD Entertainment.  They debuted as a co-ed group in 2007 and have gone through a number of companies throughout their career including For Everyone Entertainment, Nega Network (previous home of the Brown Eyed Girls), and LOEN Enterainment (home of IU).  

**Company:**  I can't find anything online about them, not even a webpage, facebook, or twitter account, at least not searching in English or a machine translated version of the company name in Hangul.

**Debut:**  September 20th, 2007 with their Love Letter maxi-single.  No MV was released, but here's a Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8AVcy63Pm0)) of their promoted single 'Ring Back Tone'.  They also promoted 'Because It's You' from that album, here's a [live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANbo5-TfaNU).

**Most Recent Comeback:** October 25th, 2019 with Nom Nom Nom ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4DaypnKWDg)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXm9Zyjmds)).  According to the group the song is about bad people, and the lyrics ([lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hrgao_s7RCU)) seem to call out guys who cheat and play games.  While 'nom nom nom' is English-meme for eating something, according to Papago the Hangul translates into Korean as 'son of a bitch'.  I get some BEG vibes from this song, not sure if I'm imaging it since the group did have quite a bit of interaction with them early on or if some of that energy just rubbed off.  The composer, Park Geun Tae, has worked for the Brown Eyed Girls (Warm Hole), Gain (Apple), and was also responsible for the Solar/Luna/Hani collab 'Honey Bee'.  This is their first comeback under their new company, and the first with their two new members Eunjoo and Geonhee.

**Other MVs and Live Stages:**

* Love Is All I Know ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnESaywtaoY)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCUIo1m9vnk)) - This is their first release under Nega Network.  It looks like it was filmed on a VHS camcorder someone found in the back of a forgotten storage room, but the song is happy and upbeat.
* Mamma Mia ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k5DSS1nOiM)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCpMiV5sZQo)) - This is a Narsha song, but it features Sunny Hill and it was the beginning of them gaining public recognition.
* Pit A Pat ([digital single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r525oocitE8)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHI_GjvezeM)) - This was an OST release for the KDrama The Greatest Love and marked the first time the group charted on their own
* Midnight Circus ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjBHPvYW3Gk)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFDz03aHXGE)) - Following a two year hiatus and a switch from Nega Network to LOEN Sunny Hill released one of their most iconic songs and MVs with Midnight Circus, the title track of the EP by the same name.  Featuring a creepy circus aesthetic and BEG vocal feel.  It was composed by Lee Min Soo, who was responsible for LOVE and Abracadabra for BEG as well as Good Day and You &amp; I for IU.
*  Pray ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uive4DMqAdc)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2jqj6FTuWE)) - A poignant ballad with a dark and disturbing MV.  This marked their first trip into the top-10 Kpop charts.
* The Grasshopper Song ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHSEd_-tqy8)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZz7uUVszqA)) - Another Lee Min Soo composition, this one is based on the fable of the ant and the grasshopper and has a more traditional dance beat.  This was their highest charting single, reaching #3 on the charts, their biggest selling physical release album with 12K sales, and their biggest selling digital release with over 2 million sales.
*  Princess and Prince Charming (Is the White Horse Coming) ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG3QZHMkyPg)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVoTJ2sujHs))  A sexy electro-dance number with a tongue-in-cheek video exploring the benefits of dating for love vs money.  This was their first release after the sole male member of the group Janghyun left for military service.
* Goodbye to Romance ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkmSxGCGW8Y)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXXXVVsEFn0)) - A pretty ballad about their first loves, and continuing their string of well-received songs penned by Lee Min Soo.
* Love Actually ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MStMdxnrYyY)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMJ7TziIPWI)) - A collaboration with Korean band Daybreak, the video is fun, and I recommend turning on the English subs as the girls talk about their ideal guy with horse-like thighs, a hair chest, and the perfect sized head.  Rapper Misung co-wrote and co-produced this song.
* Cold Day ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p56tNAsAVes)) A solo ballad by member Jubi featuring Yoon Hyung-Sang.
* Darling of Hearts ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsbiwkMY5kg)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRYmlusv_fY)) - The lead single from their EP 'Young Folk' this features Korean folk musician Hareem.  This album marked a stylistic shift as they followed a reimagined folk song theme.
* Always Love You ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKPV3N2LCVU))  - A duet between member Kota and Kim Hyung-Jung of boy band SS501.
* Don't Say Anything ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-p46SkT9V0)) - This marked the return of Janghyun from military service, but also his last appearance as a performing member of the group as he stepped back into a pure producer role following this.  It's a beautiful ballad though.
* Once Summer ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEOzdB8G-7U))  - A pretty ethereal ballad
* Monday Blues ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmWf1pFjodY)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihH8ghiXsE)) - The lead single from their first full album 'Sunny Blues Part A'.  Another sexy/sassy BEG-esque Lee Min Soo composition with a sexy-office worker MV exploring the dread of Monday after a weekend.
* Here I Am ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Isov_SmYhY)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVL4DKvZUZs)) - An electropop ballad with lyrics by member Misung
* Child In Time (Take off the Uniform) ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHB5jlv-Atg)) Alternate MV ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIZBN5mpQs0)) Special Live Acoustic Version ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfIm6WUCwm4)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJx5ph3fqU)) A beautiful ballad/acoustic-rock tune with some great acoustic instrumental backing about coming of age and the desire to be an adult as a child and then reflecting on one's childhood as an adult.  This was the lead track from their album 'Sunny Blues Part B'.
* On the Way Home ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-67pGMcgW3k)) - I'm not sure how to classify this one, not quite ballad, not quite upbeat, but yearning and emotional with some really cool chord movements especially near the end.  The song talks about the warmth and comfort of home as a refuge against the anxiety of the world, and due to shots of previous performances by the group being featured in the video and the lyrics some worried this was a goodbye song from group.  This is one of my personal favorite songs of theirs.
* Get The X Out ([lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkT3QM2GSbc)) This is a B-side from 'Sunny Blues Part A', there's no MV, but I had to include it, it's one of those songs that gives me a mile-wide grin when I listen to it.  Who doesn't love a cheery carnivalesque F-you song?
* Crossroads ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugN3SbKHLuQ)) A lovely retro-feeling slightly jazzy ballad with some really nice Rhodes Piano in the accompaniment (I'm a sucker for that sound)

**Thoughts:**  I usually do a group trivia section but I sort of interspersed it throughout today.  I feel like Sunny Hill is a group that's been one step away from breaking out big, and could be considered the parallel of the Brown Eyed Girls had Abracadabra not blown up.  There's a ton of talent in all of the current and past members, they've just never gotten that big break.  Anyway, I hope anyone reading this enjoys it and Sunny Hill gains some new fans.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That's it for today, normally I'd have some additional groups featured, but just doing Sunny Hill took a lot more time than I anticipated, so we'll see a return to more groups next week!

I've experienced this many times where I'm like ""wooow this is a bop"" but then the song does a 360 and suddenly you're like ""aw noo"". For example, I love the first rap parts in Monsta X's ""Shoot out"", but I don't really like the pre-chorus and the chorus. And that makes me annoyed since I wan't to like it but it's nor for me. That doesn't mean I don't like Monsta x, that's not the point here.

2773,2019-11-18,2019,11,18,14,dxykro,SuperM in Washington DC (FAN ACCOUNT),hailogical,1574053383,"I went to the SuperM concert in DC (really in a college campus in Fairfax, Virginia). I am writing this about 3 hours after the concert while my ears are still ringing and my throat is still dry from screaming. A little about myself: I am a huge NCT stan and this was my first time going to an SM concert. I live in Maryland and it took about 40 minutes to get to the venue. This is also my first time writing a fan account so Ill just write what I think is important and the things that made this concert unique. 

I went to this concert with two friends so we carpooled. Before the concert we went to a McDonalds to get a food and you could tell there was a decent amount of people going to the SuperM concert. Parking fees were included with ticket prices which already werent bad so THANK YOU EAGLEBANK ARENA. Also parking was very close to the arena so thank god we didnt have to walk to far in the cold. 

We sat in Section 103 Row S which was higher up but its a somewhat(?) smaller venue so there isnt really a bad view. All the performances they did at the stage further up I had a great view of including Baby Dont Stop and No Manners. You already know I had a fantastic view of Taeyong grinding on the floor and you know everyone went wild. 

I Cant Stand the Rain was an incredible opening (I wish Jopping was the intro tho so I would have more of a voice to yell Marks verse). Seeing god Taemin himself live was an experience Im honored to have been in his presence once in my life. 

This is SMs first time having a concert in the DMV area (DC Maryland Virginia) so they probably werent sure how many people to anticipate. During the first ment Mark said something along the lines of that it was the most packed arena during the concert so far. (Based off of ticket availability before concerts started it seems like it was) Based off this newfound info I hope SM decides to have their groups stop by DC for a tour!! Mark also thought the venue would actually be in DC and we are like 25ish minutes away from DC. And yes Mark we were all thought it would be in DC too lol. Also 10/10 for someone doing their research and telling Mark about the DMV area (not the Department of Motor Vehicles!!). 

One of the funniest moments during the second ment(?) Taeyong mentioned that he wanted to see the White House and [everyone goes NOOOO](https://twitter.com/mistyyeosang/status/1196227405914017793?s=21) and then mark is like ok... yall said no ok. I think its clear what the crowds political views were lol. 

SOLOS
Taemin is fantastic I dont need to say much more but I lowkey wished he performed Want or Press Your Number because those are my favorite title tracks. 
They better release Taeyong and Marks solo bc I want to hear actually the lyrics!!! Taeyongs stage was really cool the backup dancers were like police chasing him with flashlights and at the end they catch him and drag him away. Those backup dancers were amazing at one point (I dont even remember which song tbh) they were standing in the stage where SuperM rises out of for the beginning and they did like a little wave and I really loved it. 
I really loved Lucas solo!!! I hope they release it because it was a banger and I would actually like to hear the lyrics besides WHEN THAT BASS GO BOOM. 
Baekhyun performed some of Betcha and all of UN Village and the fanchants were crazy for UN Village. 
Tens Dream in a Dream was magical hes such a fantastic dancer and it really shows in DIAD and New Heroes. Im glad SM gave him those two station songs. 
Kai might as well have gone shirtless for his stage! He was wearing a jean jacket with only the top button buttoned. According to Mark he went so hard his in ears broke!

BABY DONT STOP
This song gets its own special section because it has a special place in my heart since its from the Empathy era. When the song started I went crazy and tbh everyone else was too! Everyone was yelling BABY DONT STOP which was fantastic. I am so sorry to the people around me bc you can definitely hear me yelling in your recordings. 

JOPPING
My favorite part is Marks verse after the second chorus. My voice was literally gone during Marks verse and its so funny to listen to a video of me rapping to it before and toward the end of the concert. Thats the only reason why I wished they performed it at the beginning so my voice wouldnt be gone lol. 

NEW SONGS
SM please release Dangerous Woman and With You I need that HQ audio!!!! Dangerous Woman was really catchy and the audience was singing along to the chorus once they knew it. 

LIGHTSTICKS
There were a lot of people with the new SuperM lightsticks! Besides those there were a lot of people with the NCT lightstick (including me), lots of Shinee too!! Kind of hard to tell for EXO since its not as distinctive and large in shape like the NCT and Shinee lightstick. There also was a older elementary(?) aged girl with a EXO lightstick and it was adorable. Also shout out to SM for all the lightsticks syncing for this concert not just SuperM!!! Unfortunately, the NCT hammer can only turn like 3 shades of green and red but so when the lights turned purple they kind of stood out but its ok. Also there was a girl in front of me with a seventeen lightstick with flowers in it who kept changing the colors to match everyone else thats true dedication!

I think thats all! If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment Ill respond!",21,1

I am only stressing this because the genre itself is very visually pleasing so might as well get the best out of it.,60,1

I also hear 'crap your hands' instead of 'clap your hands' in TWICE's LALALA and 'fajita!' in SNSD's Party instead of 'finito!'. There's more, but those are the only ones I can think of right now.

to be clear: I *know* I'm definitely hearing these wrong (cos, y'know, *why* would the SNSD girls chant 'fajita!'??) and they weren't the actual lyrics.. but my dumbass literally had to look these up to be sure when I first misheard, and now I cannot unhear these.",86,1

2874,2019-11-18,2019,11,18,22,dy3idd,We All Know the K-Entertainment World Trainwrecked This Year...,aloofcrisis,1574085503,"But have we really taken a moment to consider just how awful it has been? You can literally make a list. Let me be the one to present to you that list.  


The year started out with  
1. The Burning Sun scandal. Need I say more?  
This involved giants of Kpop and we were all rattled. Some serious trust issues developed in the public of Korea as well as internationally. All kinds of names showed up on the list of those involved. All kinds of well liked artists canceled for it.  


2. Whether accusations are all true or not, questionable and damaging news concerning BIGBANG members, except for Taeyang from what I've seen.  


3. Revelations of abuse concerning kpop groups and the pain that the members suffered.  
\- sexual abuse of ATEEN

\- TRCNG's physical violence abuse/starvation   


4. Two of the public's beloved couples went to nothing.  
\- No more Song Joong Ki and Song Hye Kyo  
\- (In process) Goo Hye Sun and Ahn Jae Hyun   


5. IKON lost B.I.  


6. Straykids lost Woojin.  


7. Monsta X lost Wonho.  


8. We all lost Sulli.  


9. Han Seo Hee is apparently invincible and has fun partaking in the downfall of many. Yes, sis gets her own mention for all the stuff she's done.

&amp;#x200B;

10. The Produce 101 voting corruption.  


I think you all get it. I'm sure I'm missing some things so you can add to the list. But crap.  


We've bit hit by a ton of bricks with really messed up info surfacing. But I'm glad it has surfaced so we know what we're really dealing with. It makes you think twice before worshipping ""idols"" for being ""perfect."" Makes you think twice before you stan at all because you don't know if your fav is secretly a criminal. Makes you think twice before you celebrate a new kpop group's debut because it could be at someone else's expense.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a miserable time overall for K-entertainment, so here's to hoping that things don't get worse for this year and that things start looking up for next year.",1,1

2899,2019-11-19,2019,11,19,1,dy5gie,I'm a 21yo adopted American Korean and kpop is making my life weird.,zipadee808,1574094542,"So I'm actually not that mad at all I more find it funny and extremely weird. It's not like It made my life harder or anything which is why I can't complain too much because I don't have it nearly as bad as as other ethnicity. I actually like the community for the most part they're woke, very kind and at times very respectful and I agree with what a lot of them say.

&amp;#x200B;

So to start off if you didn't read the title I am adopted so my Korean influence is very slim. I didn't really got bullied that much as a kid, fellow asians on here know what I mean when I say it was small stuff that only bothered me if I let it. things like being called ""squinty eyes , China man, very small stupid stuff like that. And people thinking I'm from china first before guessing anything else. But That's all very young children so they really don't know better.

But my first encounter to it was when people asked my ethnicity the first thing they said after that is ""do you like kpop."" the amount of times that has happened is crazy more than you'd think. but still that ones not bad I try to justify it only because of how new and big kpop is, so I never get that angry about it.

But now we're getting to the point where it's weird and makes me a bit angry. I get girls yelling at me saying 'BTS!"" or ""We love bts""! that's when it was getting weird. That's like me yelling Will Smith at a black dude. Now it's not just kpop I get called Bruce Lee or Rice Scum a lot too but people usually yell BTS the most. What's also weird is that it's like teenage girls, sometimes very young.  So now we have young girls basically cat calling dudes because they're asian. although I kind of just thought of it as people asking if I was from

Now this is where the fetishizing comes in. My current gf is white and does not like kpop which was kind of a green flag for me more on that later. But social media. she's has quite a big following so when she posted a picture of me for the first time I got a few followers from it, and yes they did follow bts and other kpop celebs and yes I do follow bts to avoid dating another kpop fan (more on that later) I don't really post pictures of myself but when I posted the first few pictures of myself the moment that happens I get all these people following me and what's more wild is more than half are kpop fans. like a good 85% my account is now private. I don't know these people they have no reason to follow me except that fact that I'm asian. I know i'm going to get a bit shit for this part but I understand I don't have relevant opinions of social media. But still small 1st world problem more annoying.

So I've dated a kpop fan before not really bts which is why I'm mad bts fans are getting most of the shit when this happens around all kpop. But this is the most toxic relationship I've been in for other reasons other than kpop. But 1st off my friend set us up because she knew this girl liked kpop so there's that. 2nd my ex once said I was ""bad at being asian"" whatever that means??? Or makes jokes about me not being asian enough? Like tf that supposed to mean?

last thing my current gf has a kpop friend we've both known this and kind of tried to deny the fact that she was attracted to me but sure enough she was head over heals. apparently she talked about me all the time said I was ""perfect for her"" and it all kind of makes sense with the way she acted around me. And this is just one thing she's done before. She stalked someone because they were asian. low key bragged about having sex with an asian. And It's just uncomfortable and weird. I'm tired of being followed (literally) and stared at because of my race. It's just a little annoying. It's really not a HUGE deal but I've always wondered if other asian people had the same thing happen. 

I saw a post that I can longer comment on but OP mentioned some of these same things and the comments where mostly people defending the community which is fine but... yall aren't asian of course you aren't going to see it, you're also part of it so like maybe try to have a more unbiased view on it. It's just silly. This is one of those things where I wonder in a few years we're going to look back and be like ""yeah...that was kind of racist"" because tbh it is sometimes. I don't really care THAT much about it but I'm seeing it more and I think it's something that should be recognized. I don't want to cancel yall but just be self aware ask yourself why you like kpop. 

Also I'm very intrigued to see the discussions on this post. all love &lt;3",2,1

Hi, my name is JOJO owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w?view_as=subscriber). I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules
5. latest comment by Wednesday since I translate on Thursdays

Be back on thursday night for update!

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

So here's my question, why do weebs and koreaboos hate each other so much? What sparked this war in the first place? I first noticed this trend while I was browsing through social media where the weebs and the koreaboos are just bashing one another.

Normally I wouldn't pry much into this situation, but recently a friend of mine started to pester me to watch some kpop videos, I watched some and gave my honest opinion: I don't really like it. Well that phrase triggered him a lot and him, knowing that I'm a Weeb started to bash on my interests, these are the actual things he said: ""at least the people in this [K-pop group] are real and yours are all fictional"", ""you are disgusting, there are people in your fandom that cosplays and you are saying you are associating with them?"" Etc. So I don't really get why both sides get this much hate thus, I created this discussion here to ask about your opinions from the koreaboo side.

You guys can help answer my questions based on the point of view of the koreaboos while you guys can ask me questions and I'll try to answer to the best of my abilities from my side.

I hope this will at least give some insight between how the two groups view each other and hopefully we can understand each other better and stop this bs. Thanks.",10,1

So I'm not trying to perpetuate hate or anything along the sort, but I recently saw the video with Amber Liu and to say I was disappointed (but not surprised) would be an understatement. Considering she was answering questions on this page not even a week ago, this may feel a little like opening a sore wound, but I swear I mean good by this.  As a black Kpop fan, I think I can speak for a good majority when I say it's really difficult being a black fan in Kpop. There's definitely a lack of understanding it seems ESPECIALLY between Kpop idols and black history, culture, and the current issues faced. I just wanted to see how other people (regardless of race) felt about this situation, and even other situations that have encountered within the Kpop fandom as a whole. Again, this is NON-HATEFUL, just an honest discussion. Thanks for reading, and I hope to respond to everyone's comments!

I have been visiting this sub regularly for about 3 years now, and I like to take the holidays as an opportunity to give something back.  We may have our problems, we may argue, squabble, and disagree on many things, but I personally feel like this community does a hell of a lot better job at providing a place where we can have meaningful discussions and keep up to date with the most recent news in the Kpop landscape without a bunch of drama than any other English kpop forum.  While we all have issues at times with the moderators, they do a good job in regulating the stuff that gets posted here and makes sure this community stays productive.  

As such, I wanted to give back to this community and its mods, and in order to do that, I will be giving away **15** brand new, unopened albums of YOUR choice.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

14 of those albums will be open to everybody, and 1 will be reserved for a moderator, should one or more choose to enter.  If no mods wish to enter, all 15 will be randomly selected from all the entries.

_______________________________________

**There are a couple of rules on what albums you may choose should you win:**

1.  The album must be from this year.  You may choose an album that is scheduled to release by the end of the year or one that has previously been released this year.

2.  The album must be available on Amazon (most are) and cost no more than $50. 

3.  It must be an ALBUM, no monographs, DVDs, or any other non-album merch.


Winners can take this opportunity to pick up an album they missed this year or one they are looking forward to in the coming month.  Winners WILL be able to choose the version of the album they want as long as it is available.

In the spirit of Christmas, I will also allow the winner to give their album away as a gift to a friend.  I will pay the extra cost to have it shipped as a gift, with a personal message from you, to a friend's address, should you choose to go that route.

You might be wondering why I am doing a Christmas giveaway in the middle of November, but my reasoning is I want all the winners to receive their albums by Christmas, and shipping times during the holidays being what they are, I felt better safe than sorry.
________________________________________________________________________

**To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating answers to the following questions:**

1.  What is your personal pick for Song of the Year?

2.  What is your personal pick for Music Video of the Year?

3.  What was the favorite thing your bias group did this year? (Can be a comeback or something else)

Please try to give more than just one word answers and explain your choices.  Its just more fun that way!


I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I am adding a new rule this giveaway.  If you are mostly a lurker here on reddit but you are active in the major group discords or the /r/Kpop discord, you may still enter, just leave your discord name on your entry or PM me if you are uncomfortable having that information public, and I will check your activity on discord and approve your entry accordingly. 

Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or answers to the entry questions.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  This giveaway is for the /r/kpop community and is not a free handout to people who dont contribute here.

I do want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

*I want to note that Australia is unfortunately on the watch list for being restricted for entry because Amazon has stopped delivering to Australia after introducing Amazon.au (which has far less Kpop album stock).  Hopefully I don't need to put in that restriction in the future, but I am just giving the heads up.  You may still enter this giveaway if from Australia.*

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!",238,34

I think instead of being blindly hateful, we should take this as proof that kpop is officially mainstream, and this  movie will push kpop up even more since its coming next year. I just want honest thoughts for kpop fans on what you really think about this. I think it could be a box office hit right? Especially if its playing nationwide and not select theaters. Whats so bad about this? Its not going to be offensive as a korean on twitter said.  What do you think?",49,1

That was a group disbandment that ended on good terms for all the members and it didn't seem like their friendship was impacted at all (except maybe becoming stronger).

So, regarding other groups throughout the years who have had members leave or been disbanded, I was curious how many others still maintained a good/neutral relationship with their former fellow members. 

If the split was not amicable, it's to be expected if members don't acknowledge each other. I especially wanted to know about all the groups whose members have said that they are not disbanding/ x or y is still a member after signing with a different company, whether you expect them to return as a group with all those members.",71,1

But I think we can all agree that both J-Pop and K-Pop enjoy a certain level of popularity accross the world. Korean pop culture is even refered as Korean Wave. 

So my questions are : Do you think another Asian country will gain as much (or even more) popularity as these two in the future, regarding pop music? Which one ? And why ? And if not, why ?

I wouldn't be surprised to see T-Pop (Thailand) gain more popularity. I also thought about C-Pop (China), but I'm not so sure, considering the restrictions of the regime. But both of them still need time to develop. Maybe in a decade, more or less.

There are also Q-Pop (Kazakhstan) and V-Pop (Vietnam). But imo, none of these are big enough to gain real attention. They too need time to develop, even more so than C-Pop and T-Pop. Maybe in a further futur.

What are your thoughts guys ?

There are a lot of active groups in Kpop, so finding six contestants should be easy, although getting the balance between groups well known enough to attract viewers but not too well known to make it seem like it's a competition is tough. We basically all knew that Mamamoo would win it from the first episode (I was personally hopeful for (G)I-DLE to maybe upset though).

I was just wondering who your six contestants would be for a new season.

Also maybe a potential list for Kingdom?",2,1

As you might have heard, Rebel Wilson is making a kpop comedy movie.

I just want honest thoughts for kpop fans on what you really think about this. I think it could be a box office hit right? Especially if its playing nationwide and not select theaters. Whats so bad about this? Its not going to be offensive as a korean on twitter said.  What do you think?",4,1

3268,2019-11-21,2019,11,21,6,dz8mhy,"191119 SuperM's ""We Are The Future Live"" in NYC [VIP] [Barricade]",SoapyRainWater,1574285654,"Hi ok so this will be a fan account of both before and during the concert! 


Before 


Ok so I arrived really early to the venue (around 10:30am) because there was a Kaibaek cupsleeve event near by. Also SuperM was gunna ""text"" us some location in NYC for something we didn't know at the time so I definitely wanted to be there early just in case I had to run my ass over to wherever. It was basically a billboard. So nothing really happens worth mentioning here. The cupsleeves were very nice tho! I didn't go to the billboard cuz I wanted to stay close to the venue.


Fast forward to like... 1pm. I have this small fanproject, I made Mark cards that look like [playing cards](https://twitter.com/soapybebe/status/1183178449650946050?s=21)! So I gave them out at this time and it warmed my heart at all the nice things people said about them &lt;3


So an hour later, merch line was to be let in. It was long to begin with, practically reaching the street. So it opens and it slowly moves. About like 30 mins later, the line disappears. I'm thinking to myself as to where is the merch line cuz usually merch lines are forever long. So I go and check and there is practically no one. Like literally no one. I could walk up to the stand, buy my stuff, and move on. Not even the pc sets were gone and thats usually the first to go. Made me wonder what the point of pre-show shopping for VIP is lmaooo. 


Sidenote: MSG is actually really good with moving merch lines. If you go up there and you don't know what you want, they are gunna tell you to move on. So that's probably why the line moved so fast. 


Fast forward to 4pm. VIP gets let in. The line for VIP is like on the other side of the venue. So I go with my friend to line up. Let in no problem. But the one thing I'm actually really pissed about is that we got our merch package in a damn plastic bag. The other stops had theirs come in SuperM tote bags. How did they run out???? They have to have enough for all VIP. And the thing is that I actually saw people have the totes. It was seriously so disappointing. So after we pick up our package, we were ushered by all these security guards to the main lobby and told to leave the building. Ok I guess there isn't any VIP line to get in the venue first. 


So an hour later doors should be opening to let people in but we're given mixed answers by so many gaurds. So the ""line"" to get in the venue, is past the merch booths inside. It was basically a crowd to the right and left along a row of doors. So this is where the mixed answers come in. We asked if there was any VIP line to get in, get told no. Alright. Then a couple of people from my group chat said they are on a VIP line in the VIP room. Where is this??? What room??? They said after you get your package. But we were told to leave the building right away... Now we are stuck in this lobby and I don't want to walk past security and go allllll the way around the building to get back on the VIP line. So I over heard a group of girls ask this security guard where can VIP line up, and he said to your left. So I follow them and it basically just leads us to the crowd on the left. Not a line. Like this left crowd cant all be VIP cuz we also heard that to get on the VIP line, you have to show your badge. Not everyone here has badges so I'm very confused as to what's going on. 


Finally they let us in. I get to my seat and I got barricade on the left of the extended stage. I've never IN MY LIFE, have been this close. I was honestly having a little bit of a panic attack lol


During


Ok so I had quite a bit of interactions here ;_; Mark is my bias btw (also in the entirety of nct) so to be that close to him was just mind blowing. The first time they got on the extended stage, he came on my side and instantly looked at me. Basically I was wearing his outfit from one of the SuperM teaser pictures where he's on the bike with the red bandana. So he must have noticed that ;_; But I had one interaction with him that was definitely memorable. There was this girl behind me with a Neobong Keychain and whenever she would record, she would record above my head. So the key chain was dangling over me. So Mark came over (I think it was during Dangerous Woman?) and he pointed to his head and then to me. At first I didn't know what he was trying to tell me cuz I was in a bit of a shock that hes looking at me rn lol. But a couple of seconds later, the dangling keychain hits my forehead and mark goes ""aww :("". So I realized that he was trying to tell me that it was gunna hit me :(((((( my baby looking out for me omg


Basically Ten, Mark, and Taeyong were mostly on our side. So they looked at me alot and it was really a dream come true. Also Lucas waved at my section during the first opening ment. He's so damn cute &gt;:(((( I didn't get much from Baek, Kai, and God Lee Taemin but thats ok cuz I'm not worthy. Also during Baby Don't Stop, Ten and Taeyong did the ""kitty"" thing right in front of me. Safe to say that my eyes were truly BLESSED.


Now this is the big highlight of my experience: I caught Taeyong's signed ball!!!! During their new song (forgot the name) before their ending ment, each member tosses a basket full of signed plastic balls. So at this point, I didn't think I would ever catch one and even if I did, I would fumble it right over the barricade. I was calling out to every member cuz I didn't care who's I caught, even if it's not Mark. So Taeyong comes over and his basket is almost empty, tosses a bunch to the crowd behind me. So I'm calling out to him and he takes 2 in one hand (a red and green one) pretends to throw it long ways but then under hands both to me and another girl to my left in the front. HE LOOKS AT ME AND UNDERHANDS THE GREEN ONE TO ME AND I CAUGHT THAT SHIT WITH ONE HAND. CATCHING THAT SHIT AND NOT DROPPING IT, WAS A FEAT ON ITS OWN LOLL. The fact that he threw this ball to me personally instead of hail marying it into the crowd, is literally the best thing that has ever happened to me. I'm literally gunna treasure this plastic ball for the rest of my damn life.


So the concert ends and I miss them so dearly. They were amazing performers. Ten is the definition of art. Baekhyun's vocals are god tier. Lucas is just precious. Kai got me feeling some type of way. Mark is a whole ass baby and no one can tell me otherwise. And God Lee Taemin blessed us with his presence and I had an out of body experience.",2,1

I was extremely impressed with the album. To start with, theres no JP covers of Korean songs!! 10 original tracks!! 
Then they managed to capture the quintessential Japanese funk/synth sound, that's so different to kpop, and make it their own. I don't quite know the terminology but like... if you didn't know the difference between the two languages, I'm convinced you would instantly decide '&amp;TWICE' was the Japanese album.
'Stronger' &amp; 'What You Waiting For' are my instant favourites so far. Chaeyoung co wrote &amp; composed 'How You Doin' which is awesome!!! That's the first composition credit given I believe. Doesn't hurt that the song slaps.

Hello, this is my first time and on Reddit and made an account just to talk about this. There is a small group called **TRCNG** and they are under a company called **TS Entertainment.** (You may know them as the company that had B.A.P, Sonamoo and more.) Recently two members of **TRCNG** filed a lawsuit against their company for **Child Abuse, Assault and Extortion.** All I ask is that everyone who has read this can spread the word about what is going on. TS Entertainment has a long history of lawsuits from their artists such as the previously said **B.A.P, Jieun and Hyoseong of Secret, Sleepy, Sumin and Nahyun of Sonamoo and finally Wooyeop and Taeseon of TRCNG.**

If you could, please use the hashtags on Twitter **#JUSTICEFORTRCNG #JUSTICEFORTAESEON #JUSTICEFORWOOYEOP**. It would also be appreciated if you could contact popular kpop news sites. I and many others are working hard to make sure nothing like this happens again. **TS Entertainment** has gotten away with all of this for too long, so please I beg of you help support the fans, **Taeseon and Wooyeop**, The members of TRCNG and anyone who has been affected by TS Entertainment. It may seem like this one company but **it also reflects a bigger problem in the industry as a whole.** There have been many accounts of things like this happening at different companies and with different trainees/idols and it needs to stop.",1,1

Recently, several cases of our idols being mistreated under their company, TS Entertainment, have surfaced. Two of the older members, Taeseon and Wooyeop, have filed a lawsuit against their company for the abuse they went through under their management. Examples of these cases include being deprived of basic needs such as food and clean water during training, and Wooyeop getting hit with a metal chair by their choreographer.  We are a small fandom, so we dont have the power to trend hashtags or create large petitions on our own. This is why we are asking for your help. Please, help us defend our 10 shining stars, who just want to make music and achieve their dreams. The members are all so young, with the oldest member being 19, and the youngest member only turning 18 less than a month ago. TRCNG means the world to CHAMPIONS, the way your idols do to you, so we hope you can understand our pain and desire to help them.  This kind of struggle isn't exclusive to this one group,  so many of our idols are facing hardships every day. Unfortunately, most of these idols cannot voice out their pain, so let us, as their fans, be that voice. Help us fight for our idols, and through them, fight for all of our idols. Thank you so much for your kindness in helping us to get justice

I have noticed that I can be pretty picky when it comes to music, but my absolute favorite thing in music is when it has a proper bass line and percussions. Not saying that other songs don't have these qualities, but I like my bass heavy and thicc, which is why I'm a HUGE sucker for deep house. I've also tried out other types of EDM and future house is probably one of my faves as well, but right now I'm craving for some deep house songs that are heavy on the bass. Also, one of the qualities I've noticed -- the more department store-y the music is, the better I like it,, lmao i swear something's wrong with me.

Even if I'm a picky person, I hope that this'll help other people find some hidden and underrated gems in kpop, so feel free to share your faves!",1,1

3597,2019-11-22,2019,11,22,22,e00yz1,191115 - NU'EST L.O..E Page Fanmeeting Fan Account,duanifer,1574429315,"I don't think I'm great at these, so I waited a bit to see if anyone else would write one but no one has yet so I guess I'll do it! Though a warning, this was already a week ago so my memories have faded quite a bit unfortunately but I'll try my best!

I'm living in Seoul for about a year and I was able to get a ticket to see NU'EST's first fan meeting as five since PD101! NU'EST is one of my top three all time favorite kpop groups and this was my first time ever seeing them perform, so this was super special to me. I'm not in the official fanclub so I had to do general ticketing, my seat was on the second floor which I was at first disappointed with but honestly the view was so good! I went to the Friday show which was the first night of three. I specifically wanted to go the first night so that I wasn't spoiled about anything, but then I made the mistake of going on twitter Friday morning and finding out almost the entire setlist from fans who heard the rehearsal lol

**Before the Show**

I've met a lot of kpop fans since coming to Korea, but honestly to no surprise, none of them are NU'EST fans so I went alone. It was rainy and super miserable, which sucked cause even when it wasn't raining, there was nowhere to sit outside the venue and all the cafes were packed. I went to the merch booth first and bought a lightstick (my first real lightstick!!!) and a trading card set. I'm on a budget so I realllyyyy had to hold myself back from buying more, I wanted the slippers so bad :( I hung around a bit, took some pictures and got my lightstick all set up and went to the booth to get it connected to the venue. There were some other things to do if you were a fanclub member but since I'm not I wasn't able to participate.

I eventually joined the line to get inside the venue. I think throughout the whole night I saw maybe only one other non-asian fan there, I only say that because when I was standing in line the girls directly behind me were blatantly talking about how tall I was in Korean. Idk if I was more amused or annoyed, like, I wouldn't want to sit behind me either at a concert but also I'm standing RIGHT THERE. Fanmeetings are like 90% talking, I wouldn't go if I didn't know any Korean (~~ok i probably would, but still it was kinda rude of them lol~~). Anyways, I got into the venue, went to the bathroom, and found my seat. I was so shocked at how good the view was. The only Kpop concerts I've been to were at the Rosement Theater in Chicago and sitting on the second floor is so shitty there. I started getting like SO nervous leading up to the start, which usually happens to me at concerts, but especially bad this time since I was more excited than any concert I've been to before. I think the girl sitting next to me was even worse off than me though haha

Also, I will talk about the performances and talking bits separately!

**The Performances**

The most legendary show opening EVER? Bass... wow, life defining moment there. I think that was their first time ever performing Bass and it was incredible, they just posted [an official recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYPJ1GflWc8) of it from the fanmeeting and I can't recommend it enough, Minki's part after the first chorus and Jonghyun's part at the bridge are especially iconic. Also, I love their stage outfits too, nothing too special but they all looked great, especially Jonghyun.

Next was Bet Bet, I was so overwhelmed in the beginning of the fanmeeting that my memory isn't as clear, but I remember enjoying doing all the fanchants. It's fun, being in a room with thousands of people all cheering together. And I truly believe that Bet Bet was the perfect comeback title track for NU'EST as five and I was so fucking happy to see it live.

After a ment they performed Deja Vu. I'll be honest when Deja Vu was first released I was pretty let down, but then WHO, YOU quickly became one of my favorite mini albums ever and now I am a big fan. Like, I don't even know if you can call the chorus a drop but it HITS HARD live, hearing everyone go nuts when Aron/Ren start singing it is so fun. And seeing them perform it as five UGH extra incredible. I'll just say this here too, they sound so perfect live, I don't think I noticed even a single mistake the whole night. Baekho especially is incredible.

After that was a VCR, all of the VCRs throughout the night were related to shoes; them reading LOVE's complaints about their shoes, designing shoes, etc. I am not real involved with the NU'EST fandom so I don't know everything that's always going on, but maybe someone else knows the significance to that? If there is any?

Ok, and the next song. So I got into Kpop in early 2013 and early on I became a very casual fan of NU'EST (as literally all western kpop fans were at the time though tbh). I was 14 years old then and when they released Sleep Talking, I was OBSESSED. Even then I knew it was outrageous and kinda bad and so many fans hated it even more because of the concept change, but none of that stopped me from listening to it constantly. So, when the members rose up onto the stage laying on the ground wearing pajamas, I just about passed out from how much I was screaming. And honestly I think everyone else in the venue felt the same way. I don't even know what to say, that song is just so much fucking fun and always brings back such happy memories of when I got into kpop and was so excited to just listen to so many different songs and groups. I could pretend to be cool and say my favorite performance of the night was Thank You or Bass or something like that, but honestly, it was totally Sleep Talking.

After another game round they performed Storybook, because of the game they were all wearing different costumes and Baekho was wearing this outrageous shark costume and he could barely dance properly in it, I felt a little bit bad for him but honestly it was hilarious. Minhyun was cute wearing this cape and with flowers wrapped around him.

They changed clothes and then performed Love Me. Such a fun song and the fanchants were really loud. After was Stay Up All Night which I really can't remember much of at all? Though I am a big fan of that song.

And then one of the highlights, Thank You. Even before I read the lyrics and found out it was written by Minhyun, I loved the song so much. It's beautiful and dramatic and incredible and I've listened to it like a million times. I teared up a bit listening to them perform it, it's such a great song and it means a lot to us fans.

I think the beginning of the encore was Blessing, unless I'm remembering it wrong. I felt like such a fake fan! I didn't even know this song existed. When it started I could tell right away it was old school NU'EST and I know all of old school NU'EST's songs! but I didn't know this one! I found out later it's a song they recorded a long time ago but didn't release until earlier this year. As they were performing it they walked all along the second floor, they were maybe just 10 feet in front of me! Also, JR in a cap is an absolutely superior look, a lot of the details of the night to me are fuzzy now, but man, JR in a cap during the encore is so clear in my memory lol

Then they performed Talk About Love which is one of my faves and then ended the night with 1, 2, 3. The fanmeeting was honest to god almost 4 hours long, usually when concerts end I'm still desperate for more but honestly I was super satisfied lol. Like my ticket cost less than $60 and I totally got way beyond my money's worth.

**The Talking Bits + Games**

To preface, since coming to Korea I've been really insecure about my Korean abilities, I studied for a year prior at my home university but I am bad at speaking and feel I am one of the weakest in my Korean class. So like, I don't mean to flex at all when I say I was really impressed with my ability to understand all the talking ments. Almost the whole time I at the very least had a general idea of what they were talking about. I even understood some of the jokes! And puns! Also the MC that they had that night was so great, I have no idea who he was but I thought he did such a good job!

As I said before, the fanmeeting was almost 4 hours and a lot of that was talking, so I'll just list a few things I liked a lot. Before that I just want to gush about Aron a bit. HE. IS. SUCH. A. STAR. Usually I think of Minki as being the star of the show, and don't get me wrong, he totally is, but Aron was just so fucking funny the entire night. I'm not Aron biased but I feel like I was paying the most attention to him throughout the night just because he was so entertaining. If you're an Aron stan, you're doing something right. There were so many fun parts throughout the night and I'm sad because I feel like I can barely remember anything anymore, but here's a few things I do remember:

* Aron uses eye cream.... to moisturizer his whole face. 
* Minki kept calling micellar water,  (like, just saying water in English) and no one knew what the hell he was talking about
* Minhyun once saw an old man eating I THINK samgyeopsal all alone at a BBQ restaurant and now he wants to try going out to eat it by himself sometime. (~~which sound SO embarrassing imo but you do you min~~)
* Aron driving around in [this mini car](https://twitter.com/onon_onsae/status/1195374866146283520)
* ""Oppa wa na"" aegyo, and Minki doing it, like, heavy metal style
* Many of the requests were for them to do certain types of aegyo, say cheesy things, etc. and they would go one by one, throughout the night it was a joke that one of them would do something to extra early on and everyone would say ""Isn't that too much??? Shouldn't you save that for last person??""
* They did relay charades and one of the words was LOVE bong (nu'est lightstick) and all the fans just waved their lightsticks around wildly and the members waiting for their turn just thought the fans were really excited to wave at them. Also, Minki... really not that great at charades lol
* During the first round of charades, Jonghyun (who was supposed to be guessing the answer) accidentally saw the answer on the monitor and he immediately made the round stop because he didn't want to cheat, I just thought it was cute how honest he was ;;;
* There were some really touching moments as well, talking about how happy and thankful they were to be doing a fanmeeting in a venue that huge for three whole days

My memory is so bad, I wish I could add more because honestly every minute was full of fun and touching moments. I want to go back again so bad! If anyone wants to add anything else, please do! Even if you didn't go!

**All in All**

I was so blown away by the whole event, it was SO long, they performed so many songs, and both the members and the fans seemed as though they were having such a genuinely fun time the whole night. They did not at all have to have it go on for four hours, but they did! I know every fan says this about their faves, but god I just feel like NU'EST cares so much about spending time with their fans and performing on stage. Their ending ments thanking fans sound so honest and thoughtsul. I can't imagine anyone being dissatisfied with the fanmeeting, literally the only thing I didn't like was that the chairs were too hard so my back really hurt by the end lol. I honestly really regret not going to see them an additional night :( ESPECIALLY after seeing those fancams of Minki dancing to Pokerface. I also want to give a shout out to Korean fans, holy shit, way better behaved than any other fans at a kpop concert I've been to. I could actually hear the members talking! Who knew that would be possible at a kpop concert! Anyways, I can't recommend seeing NU'EST perform, or even just being a fan of them in general, enough! I really wish NU'EST had more western fans, but I am happy enough just seeing how incredibly popular they are in Korea and other parts of Asia. Again, if anyone wants to add anything, please do!",1,1

Though a warning, this was already a week ago so my memories have faded quite a bit unfortunately but I'll try my best!

I'm living in Seoul for about a year and I was able to get a ticket to see NU'EST's first fan meeting as five since PD101! NU'EST is one of my top three all time favorite kpop groups and this was my first time ever seeing them perform, so this was super special to me. I'm not in the official fanclub so I had to do general ticketing, my seat was on the second floor which I was at first disappointed with but honestly the view was so good! I went to the Friday show which was the first night of three. I specifically wanted to go the first night so that I wasn't spoiled about anything, but then I made the mistake of going on twitter Friday morning and finding out almost the entire setlist from fans who heard the rehearsal lol

**Before the Show**

I've met a lot of kpop fans since coming to Korea, but honestly to no surprise, none of them are NU'EST fans so I went alone. It was rainy and super miserable, which sucked cause even when it wasn't raining, there was nowhere to sit outside the venue and all the cafes were packed. I went to the merch booth first and bought a lightstick (my first real lightstick!!!) and a trading card set. I'm on a budget so I realllyyyy had to hold myself back from buying more, I wanted the slippers so bad :( I hung around a bit, took some pictures and got my lightstick all set up and went to the booth to get it connected to the venue. There were some other things to do if you were a fanclub member but since I'm not I wasn't able to participate.

I eventually joined the line to get inside the venue. I think throughout the whole night I saw maybe only one other non-asian fan there, I only say that because when I was standing in line the girls directly behind me were blatantly talking about how tall I was in Korean. Idk if I was more amused or annoyed, like, I wouldn't want to sit behind me either at a concert but also I'm standing RIGHT THERE. Fanmeetings are like 90% talking, I wouldn't go if I didn't know any Korean (~~ok i probably would, but still it was kinda rude of them lol~~). Anyways, I got into the venue, went to the bathroom, and found my seat. I was so shocked at how good the view was. The only Kpop concerts I've been to were at the Rosement Theater in Chicago and sitting on the second floor is so shitty there. I started getting like SO nervous leading up to the start, which usually happens to me at concerts, but especially bad this time since I was more excited than any concert I've been to before. I think the girl sitting next to me was even worse off than me though haha

Also, I will talk about the performances and talking bits separately!

**The Performances**

The most legendary show opening EVER? Bass... wow, life defining moment there. I think that was their first time ever performing Bass and it was incredible, they just posted [an official recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYPJ1GflWc8) of it from the fanmeeting and I can't recommend it enough, Minki's part after the first chorus and Jonghyun's part at the bridge are especially iconic. Also, I love their stage outfits too, nothing too special but they all looked great, especially Jonghyun.

Next was Bet Bet, I was so overwhelmed in the beginning of the fanmeeting that my memory isn't as clear, but I remember enjoying doing all the fanchants. It's fun, being in a room with thousands of people all cheering together. And I truly believe that Bet Bet was the perfect comeback title track for NU'EST as five and I was so fucking happy to see it live.

After a ment they performed Deja Vu. I'll be honest when Deja Vu was first released I was pretty let down, but then WHO, YOU quickly became one of my favorite mini albums ever and now I am a big fan. Like, I don't even know if you can call the chorus a drop but it HITS HARD live, hearing everyone go nuts when Aron/Ren start singing it is so fun. And seeing them perform it as five UGH extra incredible. I'll just say this here too, they sound so perfect live, I don't think I noticed even a single mistake the whole night. Baekho especially is incredible.

After that was a VCR, all of the VCRs throughout the night were related to shoes; them reading LOVE's complaints about their shoes, designing shoes, etc. I am not real involved with the NU'EST fandom so I don't know everything that's always going on, but maybe someone else knows the significance to that? If there is any?

Ok, and the next song. So I got into Kpop in early 2013 and early on I became a very casual fan of NU'EST (as literally all western kpop fans were at the time though tbh). I was 14 years old then and when they released Sleep Talking, I was OBSESSED. Even then I knew it was outrageous and kinda bad and so many fans hated it even more because of the concept change, but none of that stopped me from listening to it constantly. So, when the members rose up onto the stage laying on the ground wearing pajamas, I just about passed out from how much I was screaming. And honestly I think everyone else in the venue felt the same way. I don't even know what to say, that song is just so much fucking fun and always brings back such happy memories of when I got into kpop and was so excited to just listen to so many different songs and groups. I could pretend to be cool and say my favorite performance of the night was Thank You or Bass or something like that, but honestly, it was totally Sleep Talking.

After another game round they performed Storybook, because of the game they were all wearing different costumes and Baekho was wearing this outrageous shark costume and he could barely dance properly in it, I felt a little bit bad for him but honestly it was hilarious. Minhyun was cute wearing this cape and with flowers wrapped around him.

They changed clothes and then performed Love Me. Such a fun song and the fanchants were really loud. After was Stay Up All Night which I really can't remember much of at all? Though I am a big fan of that song.

And then one of the highlights, Thank You. Even before I read the lyrics and found out it was written by Minhyun, I loved the song so much. It's beautiful and dramatic and incredible and I've listened to it like a million times. I teared up a bit listening to them perform it, it's such a great song and it means a lot to us fans.

I think the beginning of the encore was Blessing, unless I'm remembering it wrong. I felt like such a fake fan! I didn't even know this song existed. When it started I could tell right away it was old school NU'EST and I know all of old school NU'EST's songs! but I didn't know this one! I found out later it's a song they recorded a long time ago but didn't release until earlier this year. As they were performing it they walked all along the second floor, they were maybe just 10 feet in front of me! Also, JR in a cap is an absolutely superior look, a lot of the details of the night to me are fuzzy now, but man, JR in a cap during the encore is so clear in my memory lol

Then they performed Talk About Love which is one of my faves and then ended the night with 1, 2, 3. The fanmeeting was honest to god almost 4 hours long, usually when concerts end I'm still desperate for more but honestly I was super satisfied lol. Like my ticket cost less than $60 and I totally got way beyond my money's worth.

**The Talking Bits + Games**

To preface, since coming to Korea I've been really insecure about my Korean abilities, I studied for a year prior at my home university but I am bad at speaking and feel I am one of the weakest in my Korean class. So like, I don't mean to flex at all when I say I was really impressed with my ability to understand all the talking ments. Almost the whole time I at the very least had a general idea of what they were talking about. I even understood some of the jokes! And puns! Also the MC that they had that night was so great, I have no idea who he was but I thought he did such a good job!

As I said before, the fanmeeting was almost 4 hours and a lot of that was talking, so I'll just list a few things I liked a lot. Before that I just want to gush about Aron a bit. HE. IS. SUCH. A. STAR. Usually I think of Minki as being the star of the show, and don't get me wrong, he totally is, but Aron was just so fucking funny the entire night. I'm not Aron biased but I feel like I was paying the most attention to him throughout the night just because he was so entertaining. If you're an Aron stan, you're doing something right. There were so many fun parts throughout the night and I'm sad because I feel like I can barely remember anything anymore, but here's a few things I do remember:

* Aron uses eye cream.... to moisturizer his whole face.
* Minki kept calling micellar water,  (like, just saying water in English) and no one knew what the hell he was talking about
* Minhyun once saw an old man eating I THINK samgyeopsal all alone at a BBQ restaurant and now he wants to try going out to eat it by himself sometime. (~~which sound SO embarrassing imo but you do you min~~)
* Aron driving around in [this mini car](https://twitter.com/onon_onsae/status/1195374866146283520)
* ""Oppa wa na"" aegyo, and Minki doing it, like, heavy metal style
* Many of the requests were for them to do certain types of aegyo, say cheesy things, etc. and they would go one by one, throughout the night it was a joke that one of them would do something to extra early on and everyone would say ""Isn't that too much??? Shouldn't you save that for last person??""
* They did relay charades and one of the words was LOVE bong (nu'est lightstick) and all the fans just waved their lightsticks around wildly and the members waiting for their turn just thought the fans were really excited to wave at them. Also, Minki... really not that great at charades lol
* During the first round of charades, Jonghyun (who was supposed to be guessing the answer) accidentally saw the answer on the monitor and he immediately made the round stop because he didn't want to cheat, I just thought it was cute how honest he was ;;;
* There were some really touching moments as well, talking about how happy and thankful they were to be doing a fanmeeting in a venue that huge for three whole days

My memory is so bad, I wish I could add more because honestly every minute was full of fun and touching moments. I want to go back again so bad! If anyone wants to add anything else, please do! Even if you didn't go!

**All in All**

I was so blown away by the whole event, it was SO long, they performed so many songs, and both the members and the fans seemed as though they were having such a genuinely fun time the whole night. They did not at all have to have it go on for four hours, but they did! I know every fan says this about their faves, but god I just feel like NU'EST cares so much about spending time with their fans and performing on stage. Their ending ments thanking fans sound so honest and thoughtul. I can't imagine anyone being dissatisfied with the fanmeeting, literally the only thing I didn't like was that the chairs were too hard so my back really hurt by the end lol. I honestly really regret not going to see them an additional night :( ESPECIALLY after seeing those fancams of Minki dancing to Pokerface. I also want to give a shout out to Korean fans, holy shit, way better behaved than any other fans at a kpop concert I've been to. I could actually hear the members talking! Who knew that would be possible at a kpop concert! Anyways, I can't recommend seeing NU'EST perform, or even just being a fan of them in general, enough! I really wish NU'EST had more western fans, but I am happy enough just seeing how incredibly popular they are in Korea and other parts of Asia. Again, if anyone wants to add anything, please do!

3653,2019-11-23,2019,11,23,5,e06uh8,Hateful and unacceptable comments during idols streams,SLC_26,1574454665,"As some of you might know, recently some Momoland members opened a personal instagram accounts. 
I recently saw some screenshots with perturbing comments during Yeonwoo and Ahin live stream.

Of course there were some f*ck you, but some of the comments were literally death threats or asking them to commit suicide, even mentioning Sulli and Jonghyun... Totally insensitive and unacceptable.

I'm not sure if they saw those comments but this kind of behavior should be punished. Unfortunately Momoland fandom is not that big, so it's hard to raise awareness.

So I am curious, Momoland gets a lot of hate, but do this kind of things also happen to your idols? Is there anything we can do? Do you think Instagram should do something to stop this? Because I think that reporting and closing those accounts is not enough... I mean, they can create another account and continue with their stupid behavior.",0,1

There are a lot of rookie groups that are REALLY talented, but some feel a bit lacking. 

For example: I think ITZY are so charismatic and the entire group are amazing dancers! But I also feel like theres something missing vocally? However, I feel like groups like Everglow, Ateez and TXT could give some 3rd gen groups a run for their money (Jongho especially, as far as vocals go). 

But just in general: do you think kpop is in good hands with the 4th gen?",93,1

If you do this for multiple people / groups then you are multifandom.  

But I've seen people call themselves multi fandom because they listen to the music of the person or group . Or maybe know some stuff about them .
I personally call them casual fans . Not exactly part of the fandom . But then again that might be me gatekeeping . I don't know.

I mean they are all so young when they debut, the companies choose someone who's pretty efficient at taking the responsibility for the group. How?

I sometimes wish there was a podcast for K-pop group leaders to talk about their struggles and the good parts of being the leader. (Some of them deserve a raise) 
Also who all are your leader biases? Are they any groups (other than BP) without leaders? Also has a group's leader ever screwed up bad?

3759,2019-11-24,2019,11,24,3,e0m5lg,ITZY Premier Showcase Tour 'ITZY? ITZY!' in Macau 191109,KylePlane,1574535042,"I saw Itzy live! It was a very surreal experience, being my first k-pop concert. 

PRE-CONCERT

Firstly, I found out about the showcase back in September. It was pretty shocking for them to come here but I presume it was because I'd the state of Hong Kong at the moment. I got the highest tier tickets, which was MOP1500 (around $190). This included the VIP section seats (which were actually very big), hi-touch, and a lucky draw. The lucky draw was as follows:

Group photo (15 ppl) - 400 tickets
Fansign - 200 tickets
Signed poster - 100 tickets

We were to be notified through the organizer's social media a week prior. Leading up to the event, the organiser asked for some questions to be sent by video for the Q&amp;A section. Once the lucky draw winners we picked, I got chosen for the signed poster, and my two other friends for the group photo and fansign. 

CONCERT DAY

The day of the concert had arrived.  I arrived at the venue with my friends an hour before the scheduled time. There was no need to camp outside or anything since it was entirely seated. 

An hour before all the merch was already sold out lol. They had your typical merch, t-shirts, light stick, banners. Funnily enough they gave bags with members' names on it but it seemed that everyone had Yeji's. 

We entered the auditorium and they had banners placed on the seats that said 'Summer   ITZY MIDZY .' Up until the concert started they were showing alternating pictures of each member on the screen while playing all their songs (remixes included).

The show actually started about five to ten minutes late. One point they turned the music extremely loud, darkened the lights and played the Want It Imad Royal remix. There were even fog machines going which made the atmosphere even more hyped. Anyone's who's listened to the remix of want it knows that it goes h a r d. The bass was rumbling the whole room lol. After the music stopped and it went silent i may have screamed itzy saranghae...

Next, they started showing a VCR on the screen. It was one where it showed all their achievements and records as well as cuts of each member. It seemed pretty equal when people screamed for each member. Another thing to note is that it seemed that there were a decent amount of guys, probably 1/3. 

So now for the setlist!

- Icy
- It'z Summer
- Talking segment
- Q&amp;A
- TT
- Hard Carry
- Game segment
- Cherry
- Talking segment
- Want It
- Dalla Dalla

ICY

They walked out and it was so surreal actually seeing them! They started with Yeji's iconic 'yass' and I was so flustered that i forgot the fanchant at the beginning. You could definitely hear them singing live. The dance break was amazing. 

ITZ SUMMER

Immediately after Icy they started Itz Summer. Everyone raised up their banners for this song. Seeing center Chaeryoung was nice :) 

The song ended and they left the stage while the MC came on and introduced Itzy with some basic facts. Something to note is that the MC spoke in Cantonese so my friend had to do the translating to English for me (thanks u/hermoomin). 

TALKING SEGMENT

Itzy came back and the crowd obviously went wild. They sat down on chairs and did their greeting. They were asked some questions by the MC (what did they think about Macau, their fans etc.) They had a translator to translate the questions from Cantonese to Korean. They learnt some Cantonese phrases which they introduced themselves with, like hello, i love you and hearts. Chaeryoung and Ryujin seemed kinda shy/tired, which was understandable. Yeji definitely had leader energy and Lia was waving to the fans the most. Yuna was so cute :') Next, they played the videos of fans asking questions for Itzy to answer. There were three questions, one in Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese. I don't really remember all the questions but one of them was if they had any nicknames that they used between themselves. Between listening to my friend translate and watching the video i kinda got lost and just ended up watching Itzy and appreciating the fact that they were right in front of me. At one point my friend and I waved at Lia and SHE WAVED BACK in our direction! 

TT

Right before they started, they told us they had prepared some special performances just for the showcase and for us to look forward to it. The track for TT started playing and once again everyone went wild. It was nice to see their cuter side, and also hear their voices when covering the song as previously they only did dance covers. It was a half performance, so they only did the first verse to chorus then the bridge and final chorus. 

HARD CARRY

Right after TT ended they got into positions for Hard Carry. It was a GREAT performance and you could really see their dance skills. Ryujin undoubtedly was the best in this, which wasn't surprising since she got casted at a GOT7 fansign. They also did vocal cover for the song which was cool. 

GAME

For their game they had a spinner to choose what kind of game to play. It landed on a game which used the bunny ears that you can move, then they had to listen to the MC say certain commands like 'left up, right down, right stay.' They had to do this for one minute. Their punishment if they messed up was to dance a x2 version of their song. 

The MC was a bit hard to understand because of his accent, so some of the members got confused when they didn't know what he was saying. I think it was Lia or Chaeryoung that messed up the first time and they had to perform Dalla Dalla x2. They didn't know which song they were going to dance so they had to quickly get into formation after hearing it. They all did so well and were laughing while doing it. 

After the 2x dance, they went back for another round of the game. The MC clarified the rules one more time and Yuna responded with 'yesssss' lol. Here Yuna messed up and the WHOLE crowd pointed at her and the rest of Itzy laughed but the MC let it slide. However someone ended up putting the wrong ear AGAIN and they had to perform Icy x2. 

This time the dance seemed more frantic and crazy. It was nice to see them let loose and have fun with it. Even Itzy themselves were screaming during the dance. They stopped at the halfway point and Chaeryoung (jokingly) fell over in feigned exhaustion. 

Finally, they played the game one more time and the MC said the commands very slowly to use more time and help them. Once again, Itzy left the stage to prepare for the next song. 

CHERRY

I was most anticipating this song, as we haven't seen the choreography for it yet (I stayed away from watching any clips from the Jakarta showcase). I definitely made the right decision! The choreography looked so red for the whole song which made it even better. Ryujin really shone here again, having quite a lot of lines and center. They were all very synced, and the whole performance did not disappoint. 

TALKING SEGMENT

For the final talking segment, Itzy didn't come back on stage and it was just the MC talking. He asked if we had a good time and for us to cheer loudly for their final two songs, and thanked the audience since it was his last part too. 

WANT IT

The crowd cheered really loud for this song, so I guess it is pretty popular. I actually made fanchants for the side tracks, and if you listen carefully in one of the uploaded videos from the showcase, you can hear me faintly shouting 'Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryoung, Yuna, Itzy, Want It Want it!' I think Ryujin makes up for her lack of center and lines in the side tracks, since she had center for most of the song. 

DALLA DALLA

I think most of the crowd was anticipating this song, especially since it is their debut track. The fanchants were so loud and everyone was cheering. Especially in Yeji's 'my life' part, which was so surreal seeing it live after just months before watching it on the Dalla Dalla m/v trailer. In the second chorus, Lia tripped over Yuna after changing positions and shortly fell to the floor but they both recovered quickly. Dalla Dalla ended the concert with a bang! 

Itzy came back after leaving the stage just to say some final words and thank you to us. They also took a whole photo for the concert with the audience. They left waving and giving hearts to everyone. 

Being a showcase, the concert was pretty short. I expected it honestly but it did not feel short at all. It was just over an hour long as we ended around 8:15 (we started at 7:05)

HI-TOUCH

We had to wait some time for the hi-touch to start, probably as Itzy rested. The staff then put up some dividers so we couldn't see Itzy, which was funny. It was quite a lot of people, so me and my friend's decided to go towards the end. Throughout the hi-touch the staff were telling us to be gentle, use our right hand and not to wear any accessories on the right. 

Somehow we managed to go very last, with only two other guys behind me. We walked up onto the stage and behind the divider. Itzy were in reverse order, from Yuna to Yeji. Yuna was beaming the whole time, and she has such a bright smile! She's pretty tall lol. Unfortunately for some reason I can't really remember Chaeryoung or Ryujin, but according to my friends they seemed tired but smiled when they came up to them. In retrospect I probably could've gone a bit slower. Next was Lia, and she said thank you to me and I said she is very pretty. Last was Yeji, who is just so shockingly beautiful in real life that pictures can't express it. She said thank you to me too. I actually said things like   to each member but i can't exactly remember what i said to who. 

As we were getting off the stage, Itzy actually came off too at the same time as us. They waved, said thank you and gave hearts. Right before they disappeared behind the curtains my friends and i shouted HUSSEY, then YUNA TURNED AROUND AND DID THE ICY GESTURE TO US. It was so shocking and surreal. It was worth the extra wait to go last. 

FANSIGN

It was my friend who did the fansign, but she said it wasn't really like those fansign events in Korea. She said that they signed their poster on the spot then had about 10-20 seconds per member to exchange words. According to her, they all spoke English. 

GROUP PHOTO

Meanwhile, my other friend got the group photo. It was with fourteen other people and they were all seated with Itzy at the back. My friend was seated right in front of Yeji and she said cheese lol. I guess the fans could've quickly said something but my friend didn't. The group photo was sent a week later through QR code. 

SIGNED POSTER

I got my signed poster from a desk after the hi-touch. It was the poster for the showcase and each member signed where they were in the picture (it's one from the icy photoshoot). I can try upload a picture tomorrow morning of it. 

CONCLUSION

ITZY is an AMAZING group that has so much potential. I don't regret getting the VIP tickets at all  even if the event was short, and it was an unforgettable experience as I got to meet them as well. If Itzy (or any group!) is coming to a city near you, definitely go! Its not everyday that you can see a kpop group let alone meet them :) It was a great first k-pop concert and hopefully not the last. 

If you guys want any pictures I took during the concert, or have any questions, feel free to ask! Thanks for reading.",5,1

Hypothetically, if your favorite groups released some sort of bonus material package at some point, or even anniversary gifts to fans, what would you like to see? It could be videos, songs, etc. What could they drop from their vault (even if it was years later) and you wouldn't even be mad about it?

For me, it would be: 

Red Velvet - Automatic MV dance version or dance practice  
NCT 127 - Once Again dance practice  
SNSD-OH!GG - Lil Touch dance version or dance practice  
LOONA - Butterfly MV red outfit version or water dance version

Clearly I just want dance practice videos or dance cuts of their MVs. I think the full MV dance cut of Red Velvet's Automatic probably doesn't exist, since it seems like they filmed the dance scenes to intercut with the other scenes, but I am willing to be proved wrong.

I had a lot of female classmates into boy bands and male classmates into girl bands but I never got the appeal myself. (It was odd, as I was one of the only Koreans in my Taiwanese high school haha.) But now, after seeing the unique presentation of the dancing and the well-constructed videos I feel like I've started to really appreciate the aesthetic.

So, I'd like to ask, any *other* singers you like?

I'm pretty into dance music but as long as you think it's good, any genre is okay. Doesn't have to be Korean-language either, I just really like the colorful, refreshing style of Korean music videos.",13,1

Korea has a huge problem, if they dont address it, this problem will only continue on years to come.

I will be hosting an award show called The Message Music Awards (TMMusic Awards for short). This is all independent, and made just by me. This show will premiere on youtube and will honour three musical legends () throughout the show. I will be posting clues on the @TMMusicAwards twitter (follow for updates).
It will contain re-runs of performances from your favourite artists.
It will have multiple awards like album of the year, song of the year and many more.. 
I chose to do this because every year award shows give out awards to artists who are charting, its NEVER about talent! Which I want to stop, multiple artists every year getting snubbed and forgotten every year (Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Nicki Minaj, Katy Perry). I hope you enjoy this project and hope you can support this for the future so this can continue for years to come..

Thank you for your time

This week let's learn about a group that has a cool throwback R&amp;B Hip-Hop sound, let's get to know GIRLKIND!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**GIRLKIND**

**Who are they?:** A five member girl group under Next Level Entertainment.

**Company:** GIRLKIND seems to be the only group under Next Level, but they also seem to represent a number of dancers.  They seem to have created and promoted a number of online-broadcast dance competitions and awards shows including the Best Vocal Video Awards, Best Dance Video Awards, Super Teenager, Step Ya Game Up, and Waacking International.

**Trivia:**  GIRLKIND garnered some attention by senior artists on debut, with BOL4 and and Pentagon's Kino both praising their dancing skills and debut single.  GIRLKIND's original fan club name was ONEKIND, but they later changed it to FANFORCE because they felt ONEKIND was too similar to rapper Eun Ji Won's fan club name of 1Kyne.  Theirhigh energy  pre-debut boy group dance cover videos had some fans calling them the 'Female BTS'.  Pre-pre-debut the GIRLKIND channel began with uploads of leader Xeheun and her little sister doing dance videos.

* Mystic Holiday 2013 (w/ a lot of other Mystic artists) ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiF9RQzqPS0))

**Trivia:** Puer Kim's real name is Byul, but she chose Puer as her stage name because she wants to live purely.  She went to high school in the USA and graduated from the Berklee College of Music, started her career as an independent singer/songwriter and signed with Mystic in 2013.  She has quite a bit more music than she has MVs for, and it's all worth checking out.  She says she'll occasionally appear on TV but she largely prefers to live under the radar and not attract attention.  She writes lyrics and music for other artists as well and says she'd like to write lyrics for idol groups (and since Mystic became an SM subsidiary she says she knows several).  Her last EP 'Gem' was released in 2016 but she's still active in writing music.  The Gem EP was entirely in English, as opposed to her previous works in Korean, and she said she felt freer writing in English since it wasn't her native language.

**Genre:** Sexy

**MVs and Live Performances:**

* Melon Shake ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJD3recvtZs)) The girl has a theme.  
* Pepero ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmSvBTZSeYo)) A chic Femme Fatale vibe in the video, and I appreciate that the MV director actually went ahead and posted in the YouTube comments and said he did it all with basically $0 budget.  One of the better looking ultra-low-budget videos I've seen.
* Pink Hard ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fu6b5IFtss)) A nice Latin vibe in this one

**Trivia:** I'm not positive she's currently active, but with a year or so between her releases previously and the last one about a year ago I'm guessing it's possible.

**Active Between:** May 24th, 2017 - September 2nd, 2019

**Reason for disbandment:** The leader Daeun left the group in 2018 to focus on her studies, beginning a period of reduced output from the group.  The remaining members announced the disbandment in September of this year stating that it was for a variety of reasons but that they hope for the opportunity to create music in the future in some other form.

**Trivia:** During their existence they did tour internationally, including Paris.  All of the members had been friends in high school previous to the group being formed.  At debut they said they hoped to stay together for 10 years and eventually play the Tokyo Dome.

3902,2019-11-25,2019,11,25,7,e15jdq,The Produce voting scandal from somebody who works in TV...,2ND_Dinner,1574632880,"Not sure why this never occurred to me before. And I hope somebody with real, non-speculative knowledge of the production schedule can chime in. 

&gt; Produced by AKATV (the company that also produced the second season of Produce 101) for Mnet, the show premiered on June 15, 2018, and concluded on August 31, 2018, with 12 episodes. It was directed by Ahn Joon-young, who also directed the first two seasons of Produce 101.[2]

On even basic competition shows I've worked on (in America), an hour long show (roughly 43 minutes, the rest is commercials) will take about 3 weeks to a month to edit. Again, in America, basically you will cut scenes and it's reviewed by episode producers who gives notes. When those notes are executed, the whole episode is assembled in rough form and the in house executive producer reviews it and gives notes. After those notes, it goes higher up to the production company's executive producers. After those notes, it goes even higher up, to the highest level, to network executives who gives their notes. 

BTW, each person might wanna give more than one round of notes. Networks usually give 2 rounds, a rough cut round of notes than fine cute. And even maybe a 3rd, locked cut, round of notes. 

If I remember correctly, the Produce seasons I watched, the episodes were 2 hours long? So around 1 hour 20 minutes? So normally a show like this might take 6 weeks to 2 months to lock. 

I don't know how post production was run admittedly, and I don't know how Korean reality competition shows run post, but I'm guessing it's quite similar. On an episodic show, you have teams of editors who work. At any given moment, 3 episodes are being worked on at the same time. Maybe more. But as episode 1 is being locked (locked means no more changes are to be made, it's done... ready to be passed along to onlining, color and sound people), 2 might be going through internal notes process, and episode 3 scenes are being built from the raw footage for the first time. 

If this is making any sense at all, you'll see how a show like Produce would be almost impossible to be legit. Shows like American Idol go weekly, too, but they air live. The only things being edited are background packages and stuff that goes in between. Like the singers marveling at a car that is getting product placement, or being coached by a famous singer. Produce was very different. It was not live, everything was edited, and there were a LOT of things going on. Even if they hired 100 editors and were editing 24 hours around the clock, it would be tough be really hard if not impossible to produce a 2 hour long, non live competition show in 4 or 5 days (1 or 2 days for onlining, color, sound, comforming, etc). Just getting a super rough cut of a two hour show done in 4 or 5 days would be rough. It would take about 15 or 20 really good editors working with decisive, savvy producers to get a rough version that was way over time together in that short of time.

I'd imagine each episode represented about 6 or 7 days of shooting... if episodes aired on a Thursday (lets say July 12th), then that episode, on July 12th, would represent everything that happened from Friday (July 6) to Tuesday (July 10th). I'm going to assume the fake vote counting was done overnight and the ""results"" were agreed upon by the next day after the Thursday, July 5th episode aired. And the placement ceremony was shot a few days before air so the production team would have 2 days to work on editing it. Assuming it was Big Brother style, and scenes were being ""scripted"" on the fly by producers at the scene, then footage given to assistants to put into the editing server system, and the editors began cutting the scenes within a hour or hours of things (dance or vocal assessment, special guest giving diet advice, girl talking to her mom, etc) happening, I just don't think this show could be put together this quickly.    

Basically, I'm saying that the only way this show could have met its schedule is if they basically knew who was going to win going in. Maybe I'm wrong. Because when I watched Produce, I noticed some weird audio issues and such. In general, the show wasn't as polished as shows I'm used to working on. I spotted many ""mistakes."" This could be the result of a ridiculously accelerated post production schedule, the likes of which I've never experienced. But in my professional opinion, the nature of the show, it's air dates and length, made it impossible to be an honest, viewer/voted guided program. 

Going to hit post now and hope I didn't make too many writing mistakes. I don't feel like checking this over. :)",12,1

I wont hate on what makes people happy (although h*ntai does encourage the objectification of women sometimes, but thats for another discussion) and I think BTS doesnt have a very valid reason to be exempted from military service. But the problem is, the meme was implying that it was making fun of K-pop. Some people in the comments were hating BTS as people, but most were just repeating the same thing.
As quoted from the comments:
(Middle school aged girls seem to be their demographic.) (The commenter wasnt hating on K-pop but this is an unhealthy stereotype.)
...Im fully aware that every BTS fan isnt a crazed 14-year-old on stan Twitter, but those are so obnoxious that I have a permanent aversion to the whole thing.
The fan base is so f*cking toxic the girls in my class blast the music and when I asked them to [turn] it down because I didnt enjoy the music and was trying to study well lets just say it went... bad
The bts army is whats ruining their image. Very invasive and annoying bunch.
Their fans are a bunch of f*cking insane maniacs.
You get the idea.
If you didnt, basically the general public tends to generalise K-pop fans due to certain experiences in school, on the internet and so on. 
Im not hating on them, in fact I find that a lot of people do that, including me. Its not just K-pop, its everything. From races to companies. So this happens a lot on the internet.
My opinion on this is that it usually happens to BTS because the fanbase is so big and no one can really control the toxicity that the public encounter. In my school, Ive observed that some people like K-pop groups just for their looks and popularity and not to appreciate their music. 
But anyway, no matter who caused the generalisation, its up to us to fix it. I dont want to see this problem get so bad that people start hating on everything in K-pop, which can really affect the artists. Plus, I really hope people can have a more open mindset to K-pop music.
What do you think? And how can we fix it? How can we respond to such people with closed mindsets about the K-pop fanbase?
TL;DR: general public seems to hate on K-pop just because the fanbase seems toxic. Want opinions on this problem and how to fix it.",21,1

My friend think that it's ""Just Right"" because it's the most viewed music video (for GOT7) on Youtube right now. 

I kind of agree with my friend, but I feel like when I think of GOT7 ""Just Right"" is not the first song that comes to mind.

All are well known and popular kpop stars... this reflects how fucked up the industry is... the system must be changed, how many more suicides do we need to see until korea fixes their dark music industry system. It is way too messed up. The community is just simply \*wrong\*. 

I also find most of the relationships between fans and idols are indeed very toxic. They must stop painting idols as if they are some innocent virgins who are there to be the fans' boyfriends and girlfriends. I see this so often on TV shows, the idols themselves promoting this mentality ""my fans are my everything"" ""my fans are my bf/ gf"", yet they are always complaining fans being controlling over their dating lives. If they do not want their dating life being ""controlled"" or ""commented"", then stop promoting this mentality! I see them do this all the time in variety shows, vlive etc, I find this contradicting af. I am not saying they are at fault, but at least don't promote this mentality. This must be stopped. 

They should start taking those netizens serious as well, like actual legal consequences. Those internet people (especially in korea) are beyond mean, I can't even describe how fucked that community is... I have personally once cyberbullied by some korean girls in high school due to one simple misunderstanding, language barrier, and oh my... they went OFF and when I say off, it was like OFF OFF. Fortunately, they were stopped shortly after. But, damn, I can't even imagine how those idols are dealing with all the demonic and twisted comments they receive... It is crazy lol",4,1

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

Some quick thoughts after reading the [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/e1wx7d/2019_asia_artist_awards_discussion_thread_191126/), yeah, it was a bit of a yuge mess. Standing up for about five hours with no water, ultra poor facilities (yeah it's Vietnam but still) and being squashed between a hundred fangirls? Not pleasant. I haven't been stuck between this many sweaty girls since okay I'm not gonna make an analogy this time. But seeing such a great collection of artists was real nice. I've developed a new appreciation for just how good the performance quality of pretty much every group is nowadays. And yes, I almost saw one fan photographer get a baton to the face for standing on a stool.

The traffic in and out of the stadium was TERRIBLE. I got there at about 1820 which was plenty of time honestly. [Venue](https://imgur.com/iau3nnW). I had an [S-VIP ticket](https://imgur.com/McTzbeO) [(standing section close to the stage)](https://imgur.com/kv23nJa) so I made my way there and got a pretty decent view of the guest seating area, the MCs, the main stage and the close stage.

To kick things off, there was a special Vietnamese performance. The first K-pop act was Itzy, [who came out with Dalla Dalla and Icy.](https://imgur.com/HDMTZBp) One photo I really wish I got was Yuna doing fanservice directly to me (or my area), she's so cute. Itzy got a pretty good response. I can't tell whether they're actually that much taller than other girl groups in real life. Ryujin is also amazing I'd like to add.

Loona and Dongkiz won some random award and they both performed next. Unfortunately, the response for both groups was very tepid. I guess there aren't many Orbits in Vietnam. Sad, but I did hear one girl screaming Chuu so there's that. [Short Butterfly Fancam](https://streamable.com/gtgfr). Seeing Loona live was a blessing, it helped with the pain. Gowon and Aeong are super cute, Heejin and Olivia are unbelievable visuals. Also I realize now that Dongkiz means something akin to ""Kids from the East"" (Dong meaning East in Korean). For whatever reason I thought it was a weird mix of ""Donkeys"" and ""Kids"" - Dongkiz. The most bizarre group name in K-pop. Well, I definitely look like an ass now, and they won't be working with me again. They performed Fever which was actually pretty good, very disco. Much elysium. Wow. They really put their all into the dance.

Afterwards, Daniel and Snuper won another set of random awards. Snuper performed Meteor which was really good, although they had a mistake on stage (two of them ran into each other). I was like ""Snuper had a comeback recently?"" So I looked up the song and it's from 2017...I had already liked and favorited it and forgot. I'm gonna make sure to download it this time.

ITZY, AB6IX and TXT won a rookie award. Lia thanked everyone in English. There would be quite a bit of it tonight.

Idle, Stray Kids, Lee Kwangsoo and Lee Jungeun won various awards. Some things about Idle, I always thought of them as being good looking overall but they are stunning in real life. Miyeon is also really short, shorter than you'd think looking at her alone. But she's absolutely gorgeous. Minnie is also surprisingly tall, or maybe she just looked it because she was standing next to Miyeon. Shuhua is ridiculously pretty in real life too. 

Felix gave a speech in English, one of two for the night. He was like ""Aww mate, thanks for the fuckin' award ya sick cunts. We're real glad to be here in fuckin' Vietnam performing for ya true blue fair dinkum Stays, we got some ripper shit planned. Yeah uh so catcha fuckin' later ey cunts?"" Something like that anyway.

Kwangsoo is pretty popular in Vietnam, he got a lot of cheers.

After this, Idle, TXT and AB6IX performed. First, Uh-Oh and Senorita. It was great, Soyeon and Soojin killed it on stage as expected.

TXT did Crown and Run Away. The latter is definitely one of my songs of the year and the live performance makes it even better. Their dancing and choreography, overall is really creative and hard hitting. They're great.

* [TXT](https://imgur.com/MkumsdU)

Unfortunately AB6IX wasn't particularly memorable for me but I'll look up their latest song cuz I haven't listened to the studio version yet. Their dancing was good though. I got [this snap of Daehwi](https://imgur.com/loAv3R8) on one of the screens.


[Next I think RV came out to accept the Best Song Award.](https://imgur.com/a/eDhXmKK) I saw a lot of complaints about this on reddit. Come on la, all these award shows are a joke anyway. And I don't believe in giving awards to songs just for charting well anyway. UU is excellente, one of RV's best songs ever. It's my no. 3 after Red Flavor and Bad Boy honestly. The perfect combination of SNSD and RV. Okay enough of me shilling for the best idol group alive. [Sluggy presented Wendy](https://imgur.com/5bsjA3K) who looked very Presidential during [her speech in English.](https://imgur.com/bOrH84D) She's kinda giving me Tiffany vibes now with this blonde do. 

[SuJu also won an award for something](https://imgur.com/JFyeU7S) and Zico as well for...[Best Producer](https://imgur.com/zBW4Qr2), yeah okay.

There were other awards too for [NU'EST](https://imgur.com/rhrmjLn) and [Park Minyoung](https://imgur.com/IKLcDWh). 

Stray Kids performed. [SKZ were great, they have incredible energy and power on stage.](https://imgur.com/KRW1stH) [Someone was injured though,](https://imgur.com/OcpYJDB) sorry I still don't know all the members. 

I think Twice and Loona got an award between SKZ and Daniel. They gave a shout out to Mina, so sweet. So special. As for Twice IRL, Momo and Sana are super beautiful. Like wow. Momo was off the chain. Dahyun and Tzuyu are thinner than I thought though. Also Jihyo's blonde looked pretty good too. Oh yeah in case you're wondering, no I didn't catch any Jihyo-Daniel interactions. But if I was there at the guest tables I'd be playing Marvin Gaye's ""Let Get It On"" on a bluetooth speaker every time they got within a meter of each other. They don't let me go many places anymore.

[Daniel's stage got a big response](https://imgur.com/jyEJc1M), he's super popular in VN. The second song was more my speed than the first one. 

Zico performed after the break but whatever.

SVT won something, they looked fly in [these suits](https://imgur.com/m2jxqYn). And yes Woozi is as short IRL as he looks on the screen. Yoona got two awards, and BY GOD she is beautiful. She does have that sweet girl next door look, except it's the most gorgeous girl next door in human history. The dorky Yoona we grew up with yet also a world star and a legendary visual. 

* [Yoona 1](https://imgur.com/23M90tY)

Loona won a second award too. Olivia cried twice tonight. Baby Wolf, cold on the outside, but a sensitive softie on the inside. Gowon's finally got to her. SKZ won another too and Felix delivered yet another speech in English. He was like ""Bloody oath, another fuckin' award? Fuckin' sick mate, can't wait to tell the missus. Now we need to celebrate right fuckin' proper, I already dusted off a slab of VB backstage so now I need these dog cunts to bring out the Jimmy Beam. Get that up ya!"" Something like that anyway.

Momoland won an award, [they look so happy together.](https://imgur.com/DDPOBq3) Hyebin has also shot up my bias list for looking fantastic in real life. [Overall they're very cute as a group.](https://imgur.com/qiIKybj)

[Big Chungus](https://imgur.com/7089iKh) got a trophy and SVT [got another](https://imgur.com/ZdJ4PNh). Seungkwan had a chin wag and so did Vernon, in English. 

* [Chungha 1](https://imgur.com/fxkfn3Q)
* [Chungha 2](https://imgur.com/FeaqjR0)

[Momoland performed this weird cowgirl remix of I'm So Hot](https://imgur.com/eTpIYFO) where they stood still for two minutes before ripping off those schoolgirl outfits. I don't know why, it was bizarre. Although maybe it's apt because they really put Daisy and Taeha out to pasture. Straight to the glue factory for those two. They also did Bboom Bboom which got a predictably good response. They mixed in BAAM too. They're gonna be doing this for a while, aren't they?

* [Jane](https://imgur.com/Nodc3nx)

[GOT7 rolled up in red and black suits to collect their award.](https://imgur.com/3rwc5pM) Very slick. Jinyoung looked like a 90s action hero in his get up. Like he's about to star in a John Woo flick. BamBam looked to be shirtless under his suit jacket. 

[NU'EST performance](https://imgur.com/3NH5aPE), Baekho got sweaty really quickly. Like 30 seconds into BET BET. The weather was pretty mild too. 

[RV got a really big response,](https://imgur.com/HP8f6hb) they seem to like them a lot here. The ZIMZALABIM chants were defeaning.

[SVT was great too.](https://imgur.com/A2yJaUN) One thing I noticed that you might miss on camera is during the ending formation for Happy Ending, the way they line up in a line you can't see the people in the back from the front, but some of the members were absolutely dying. Woozi was half keeled over gasping for air. But they did just do three stages in a row so it's understandable. It's actually so hard and really impressive that they can do that.

[GOT7](https://imgur.com/MV2yovY) got three stages too and they more or less maintained their energy through till the end of Hard Carry. Amazing job. Also I notice that BamBam loves grabbing his crotch during performances. He grabbed it like three or four times during Crash and Burn. Almost as many times as mine thanks to being squashed between a hundred people. GOT7 was probably the second most popular group there, or maybe I was in an Ahgase section. Because the audience did a full chant and screamed their fuckin' heads off. It was like a .308 firing next to my head.

Twice and SuJu were last, and they both got HUGE reactions. SuJu was definitely, by far, the most popular group there. The stadium went nutz when Sorry Sorry came on. Also Donghae took a photo of the standing crowd after they got their final award and people were going wild trying to get in it. Thankfully I'm way bigger than most of the audience (not that I'm huge or anything, but these are Vietnamese fangirls) so I didn't get swallowed up. I heard that some people almost got crushed. 

Momo and Sana were my favorites live. Momo is legendary, she's so good.

* [Twice 1](https://imgur.com/PvjyLgO)
* [Twice 2](https://imgur.com/52SNgDA)
* [Twice 3](https://imgur.com/TQrwY52)

Overall, well, it was an experience. It was expensive and painful, and there weren't any new or special stages that I was interested in (almost everything is something the artists have performed numerous times). But my faves looked and performed great. So all the girlies. Loona are definitely a top visual group but yet they're somehow even better looking in real life. I've seen Red Velvet before ([see my fan account for Redmare](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/apdvgj/fan_account_red_velvet_redmare_in_dallas_seulgis/)) but I got even closer here. Seulgi remains my ultimate bias. She's amazing in every way. I'm seeing Itzy next for their showcase tour in NA (Houston) which I'm really looking forward to. They were super spunky and fun here, a perfect choice for an opening performance, and Yuna already knows how to work a crowd like an absolute pro. She's a champion. 

If you have any questions I'll try to answer them after I've slept for the next twelve hours.

For example:

* Pink Fantasy - Iriwa: Heesun's [Ppalliwabwa](https://youtu.be/XEkiEVxaG4Q?t=7) or SeeA's [So Pretty](https://youtu.be/XEkiEVxaG4Q?t=104).
* EXID - Up &amp; Down - LE's [Hey Baby Boys](https://youtu.be/iqFPdPMuHVM?t=41)
* WJSN - Ww:  Pretty much all of Yeoreum's little interjections, but especially her [Neomu Neomu Neomu Neumo Syung!](https://youtu.be/1d2oJUT4m7o?t=54)
* Mamamoo - Hip: The [end of the instrumental break that leads into the Bbi Bbi Bbi](https://youtu.be/JWAaDM3g-vA?t=166) 
* Mamamoo - Yes I Am:  Towards the end where they switch up the 'Follow Follow Follow' by [muting the sound on the downbeat and syncopating it](https://youtu.be/EMLcfTTn9bs?t=198).
* Red Velvet - Peekaboo: The [end of Irene's rap with the 'Blanca'](https://youtu.be/2q3Yaz0MxNg?t=71)
* Nature - I'm So Pretty: Sunshine's ['For Real' and the Omana!](https://youtu.be/DcLfutPGouk?t=162)
* Holics - Funky Dunky: The '[Yeah, Drop Beat!](https://youtu.be/pHNk8oZ2yeQ?t=22)'
* BVNDIT - Fly: Yiyeon's [part at the end of the bridge with the modulation](https://youtu.be/rsbjiVbe438?t=162)

Some of you use third-party platforms where none of these things are part of your reddit browsing experience, but for those of you who *do* see these fun extras, we want to introduce you to what we've been cooking up and get some feedback!

## Community Awards

They're here at last! Back in June, [we let you all know](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c2r89c/we_are_looking_for_new_moderators_and_help_us/) we had been granted the awesome opportunity to set our own Community Awards and collected your suggestions for designs. It took us *84years.gif* to get around to implementing them while we handled other, more-pressing issues, but we can finally introduce you to what we came up with!

**What are they?** Community Awards are unique to each subreddit and sit alongside the usual Platinum, Gold, and Silver Awards. When users give Community Awards, a percentage of those coins goes into our Community Bank. Moderators can then use this bank to grant special exclusive awards back into the community to acknowledge high quality content.

You can read up on Reddit's most recent posts regarding Community Awards here:

* [An Update on Community Awards (We Heard Your Feedback!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ci60j7/an_update_on_community_awards_we_heard_your/)

* [Data on Community Awards, and What's Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/d9qjfl/data_on_community_awards_and_whats_next/)


Since I'm the resident graphics mod, I tackled a bunch of your suggested ideas to come up with a starter set. My Illustrator file is filled with the carnage of various community inside jokes. Many ideas were excellent, but I failed to award-ify them in a way that I was happy with. Fear not! These design ideas may still find their way into our Community Awards in the future!

On we go!

***

### Award Introductions

You can view all 8 awards in one image here: [FULL SET](https://i.imgur.com/6Qgyrdn.jpg)

And this is generally what the pop-up window will look like when you click 'give award' on a comment or post: [Give an Award to this post!](https://i.imgur.com/2C5sU2c.jpg)

**[Mod Exclusive Award](https://i.imgur.com/ClwiQw8.png)**

&gt; If you see this FingerHeart Snoo set in a rainbow gemstone, it means the moderators are celebrating a user, comment, or post with special acknowledgment for bringing some kind of delightful content to our subreddit. The Mod Award grants Premium for 1-12 months, as chosen by the moderator.

**[Trophy](https://i.imgur.com/gBjZ4ve.png)**

&gt; Giant cup trophies aren't just for music show wins anymore! Award speedy posters, original content, or your bias group's achievements with this golden goblet. Alternatively, fill with water and chug for extra hydration or flip upside-down and utilize as a hat!

- Reference: [Based on the classic Show Champion trophy](https://i.imgur.com/57APQ7n.jpg)

**[Dancheong](https://i.imgur.com/mxwAONO.png)**

&gt; The lovely lotus graces the artfully painted exteriors of Korean palaces and temples, covered in exquisite *Dancheong* art. These flower designs can now be dedicated to music videos or promotional images of especially sublime beauty, to users who offer insight into Korean culture, or to recognize posts of a more solemn or thoughtful nature. 

- Reference: [Example photo](https://i.imgur.com/AbRtEOp.jpg)

**[Plastic Pants](https://i.imgur.com/eeBVbB3.png)**

&gt; These legendary see-through trousers are now yours to meme on your friends, make social commentary on standards of decency, dedicate to ground-breaking fashion choices, or just *... JYP ...*

- Reference: [NSFW JYP](https://i.imgur.com/4Uq3gbz.jpg)

**[Inkigayo Sandwich](https://i.imgur.com/S5MHshS.png)**

&gt; Completely smitten with that post/comment/user bringing great content to the subreddit? Show your appreciation by sliding them the famous Inkigayo Sandwich. Don't forget to include your most heartfelt confession, kept secret by those fluffy wedges. May your egg salad always be fresh and your handwritten phone number always be legible.

- Reference: [Koreaboo article - Idols Are Obsessed Over This Sandwich Sold Only At SBS Inkigayo](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/idols-obsessed-sandwich-sold-sbs-inkigayo/)

**[Angrily Boiling Lemons](https://i.imgur.com/8mrV5Nh.png)**

&gt; You know that feeling when you're trying to make some marmalade and you read a story about scary or toxic fandom behavior? And it makes you so upset you find yourself angrily boiling lemons in your kitchen?

&gt; *Relatable.*

- Reference: [/u/QuixoticOwl's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4scwql/the_truth_about_seventeens_fansites/?st=k39ob4hd&amp;sh=744071e0)

- Reference: [EXO's 'Wolf' MV opening line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAal8xHfV0c)

**[HYPE](https://i.imgur.com/jHYkGq3.png)**

&gt; It's coming! That thing you've been on the edge of your seat for! That comeback which will surely change your life! You've never been so ready and *so not ready* at the same time!


&amp;nbsp;

So, there they are! This set of awards is just the start. **ALL awards are currently set at the lowest cost of 500 coins.** Reddit may be making changes to the cost tiers and/or benefits that come with them soon, so for now we'd like to start very simple. We will be monitoring how our community makes use of them and whether Reddit makes any adjustments to the award system. Once some time has passed we will have more information and may be adjusting designs or coin costs.

Something we're really looking forward to is giving the community an opportunity to submit your own designs for future awards! We can have up to 15 awards total, so we have room to grow. We will want to watch this first set for a couple of months at least, but if you have some great idea or design, go ahead and take some time to work on it!

**You may add your ideas, sketches, or full designs in the comments of this post, [message me privately with them](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=alleybetwixt&amp;subject=kpop%20banner%20suggestion), or wait until we have a dedicated post for your submissions (at least two months from now probably).**

We hope you'll have fun with these awards and help us with some feedback over time!

##Banners

Let's talk about banners!

We currently have a memorial tribute to the late Goo Hara. After we mourn her loss, we will return to banner business as usual, and I'd like to know what the community wants to see.

Over a year ago in early October, I presented some possibilities for what kinds of banners the community would be interested in seeing for the New Reddit Redesign, as well as for mobile web displays ([See the 2nd Banner Bonanza](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9lktuw/the_2nd_rkpop_banner_bonanza_2018/)). From that discussion, I went ahead with the idea of compositing imagery from the top 5 MVs from each previous month and to also select some larger MV shots for the mobile version. All of the New Reddit and Mobile banners we've had over the year can be seen [in this IMGUR album](https://imgur.com/a/Yk13www).

So, let's take a chance to reassess.


### New Reddit Redesign

[Here's a look at a full year of just composite banners](https://i.imgur.com/CjZjRku.jpg). I tried to make them aesthetically pleasing as often as possible, some more successfully than others. Heh.
The options I would like to propose going forward are the following:

**A. Continue** - Composite the top 5 MV images with a slightly different design - [EXAMPLE](https://i.imgur.com/f2YOePs.jpg)

**B. Back to basics** - simplify to something cleaner that doesn't change - [EXAMPLE](https://i.imgur.com/bIlEHzu.jpg)

**C. Combo** - composite the top 5 MV images within a consistent background - [EXAMPLE](https://i.imgur.com/ikhjXXr.jpg)

I also welcome any ideas from you! Do you have something in mind?


### Mobile

**A. Continue** - feature shots from top MVs (changes 1-3 times per month)

**B. Back to basics** - simplify to something like Redesign 'B' option above

**C. Combo** - composite like Redesign 'C' option above - [EXAMPLE](https://i.imgur.com/Mg1ynoo.jpg)


### Old Reddit

The rotating banner system is still in action on Old Reddit. I've taken on so many other projects in the subreddit over the last year that I haven't had any time to host a new Banner Bonanza! I had a lot of fun creating the meme set for [April Fools'](https://imgur.com/a/fGfrZM5) ([Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b7pbbc/april_fools_rkpop_banners/)), but otherwise I've just thrown some new ones in every once in a while.

Please feel free to treat this post as a mini Banner Bonanza and suggest or create some banners to rotate in. Or message me any time to do the same. The guidelines are always listed in our [Header Images List](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/headerimages) linked in the sidebar. You can also look back at the [first Banner Bonanza](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8fkt0l/the_first_rkpop_banner_bonanza_2018/) to see how this works or how to make suggestions.

So basically the visuals/main dancers/most popular members?

It seems a bit like some form of unintentional psychological conditioning and I'm curious if you all experience this too. Some songs I've experienced this with:  


1) [MYNAME -  ](https://youtu.be/WoktNGrTPA8): I associate this with a really good time when I was overseas and I was always happy

2) [BEAST - Back to You](https://youtu.be/Jc8XOrPJbN8), [The Fact](https://youtu.be/-LTNFUE4ZLk) &amp; [VIXX - On And On](https://youtu.be/2TcXHDJIShI): they remind me of this really tough time in 2013 when I was struggling with learning a new instrument

3) [SPEED - Pain the love of heart](https://youtu.be/mQUwJxKkhNo) &amp; [MYNAME - Just That Little Thing](https://youtu.be/BCzp7l3JCEU): this camp I had when I was 13 and adapting to a new school

4) [IZ\*ONE - La Vie En Rose](https://youtu.be/WZwr2a_lFWY): I loved this song when it came out and it was the only mv I've ever streamed but it has honestly been ruined for me bc it was released when I was studying for a terrible major exam last year and that's what I inevitably associate it with now

5) [VIXX - Eternity](https://youtu.be/cIfoNcm8Psw): this was on excessive loop when I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows so every time I play it now I just feel extra emotional over a book whose contents I've half-forgotten

6) [Brown Eyed Girls - Cleansing Cream](https://youtu.be/PSKRffDyWog): this is super weird and incongruous in terms of vibes but I played Poptropica with this in the background??

7) [NU'EST - A Song For You](https://youtu.be/sGy7Qj8ePXQ): in April there was a lot of uncertainty and fear and this song was incredibly comforting so now it's become one of my sad day songs bc of the associations with it

In some cases I feel a bit disappointed that a good song has become attached to the lame past issues of my life but also I treasure a lot of these bc I view them as an avenue of vivid memory I would have forgotten without these songs. I've also noticed that these associations tend to be replaced with more recent memories if I regularly play the song again. What about you all?",66,1

4465,2019-11-29,2019,11,29,7,e35i76,Is K-Pop industry and fans getting toxic?,pianoangel7,1574980612,"From what I've been hearing lately, it seems that there are some fans who just can't control themselves from being too obsessed and demanding with K-Pop groups like BTS, Blackpink, Seventeen, Exo, etc. For example, Jimin went to this club just to hang out or celebrate with friends, yet some people kept claiming that he's a bad person and is doing something bad. On the contrary, he has the freedom to do what he wants to do, just like his other hyungs. Have you forgotten what ""privacy"" stands for? We don't control what their lives should be like. As an army, carat, blink, or other k-pop fan, we should respect what they think and feel is right and support them along the way. 

Now, going into the industry.... I think it's a mess. They work too much and too hard. After seeing YouTube videos of K-Pop groups getting injured or hospitalized is very bizarre and worrying. I do not know how their agencies work, but if you do. Don't forget to share your thoughts here. 

Being part of a K-Pop fandom is definitely a cautious step for me right now because I'm new to this. So far, the only thing that I love about K-Pop is the music that speaks in a meaningful way.  
Of course, Fake love from BTS is one of the songs that stood out to me the most because of the message. 

Aside from that, there's been some issues going on with K-Pop and I'm talking about the dark stuff that's been happening lately... But anyway, what I can say right now is that we should all be a better people than who we were before... We cannot get any worse than that. How can we solve problems if we keep piling them up?",35,1

Which among the released songs this year are on your Top 5? For me my top 5 songs this year (in exact order) are:

1. Umpah Umpah (Red Velvet) - This is weird because I'm mainly a TWICE stan, and I never really liked any of RV's songs, before this one, I mean. UU is just so cute and quirky, it almost reminded me why I love TWICE's songs in the first place.

2. Icy (ITZY) - It's weird listening to Icy in the beginning, but it grew on me over time, and I eventually liked it better than Dalla Dalla. Like UU, it's so quirky, but very energetic as well.

3. Fancy (TWICE) - It's their first song in their transition from the cute concept into a more mature one, and they hit it right out of the park! I'm definitely on board with their new concept, but I like the two songs above better than Fancy.

4. Uh Oh ((G)I-dle) - This song for me is so spunky and I love the beats. Not much I can say.

5. High Class (High School) - I'm still awaiting for their debut, but their Pre-debut single is so amazing, I can't stop listening to it.",12,1

4658,2019-11-30,2019,11,30,11,e3p4kk,Taehyungs death threats.,K-Pop-Is-Life21,1575080174,"      I feel that this is something that needs to be getting a little more attention. But, before I say anything I just wanted to point out how it isn't too uncommon for celebrities to get death threats. Just because it isn't uncommon does not change the fact that it should be taken very seriously and is not a joke. First, let's just talk about people in general. It is never okay to wish death on someone. I don't care who you are, how much money you have, what race you are, what your sexuality is, I don't care. It is not an okay thing to do. That reaches a whole new level of disrespect and immaturity. Death threats are not a thing that are taken lightly, they are very serious and you could get in a lot of trouble for them. It's not cute and it most definitely is not funny. Anyways, Taehyung has been receiving death threats recently. People have been saying things along the line of ""like grandmother like grandson"" that's not funny. ""We did not start this war, but it is we who will end it."" This is something I found quite suspicious. This made me question, what do they mean by that? Is whatever the meaning behind this why Taehyung has a target on his back? ""I promise you that in December your air will be blocked."" This is a very obvious threat. I am extremely confused, as I am sure other people are, as to why exactly Taehyung is getting death threats. If someone knows why he is getting these threats I ask that you get the word out. ""Taehyung, I came here again to tell you to leave."" I personally do noy know all of the facts and am still currently researching it, but I am assuming that they are wanting him to leave BTS or just BigHit in general. This is what is confusing me. Why create such a big deal over wanting someone to simply leave a group of singers? Looking back on videos of Taehyung nothing seems out of the ordinary. Maybe its something ARMY has done? But why target Taehyung you would think they would go off at ARMY and BTS as a whole? So there is evidence against that but its not impossible. Not to mention that Taehyung is a very caring and kind soul so he would be very easy to target. Why are they targeting Taehyung? I see no point in it. Where has Taehyung gone wrong to the point where this whole thing is happening? I dont understand. Right now all we can do as ARMY is try to get to the bottom of this while giving BTS as a whole even more love and support than we normally do, if thats even possible. Right now they are going through a hard time, especially Taehyung and we need to be there to have their back and catch them when they fall. They are mid-falling right now and we need to give them the little shove that they need to not fall and give in and to just get back on their feet and to continue running towards their dream.

I want to stay up and watch to see BTS and TXT, the only two K-pop groups I care about (sorry, lol). I'm just curious though, how prestigious or serious at the MMAs? 

There was something called the AAAs a couple weeks ago (Asian Artists Awards) and they gave Best New Artist to **three different groups** which I thought was crazy. Seemed like they just gave out awards to everyone who showed up and it wasn't a serious award show, so I couldn't get too excited about TXT winning. lol How do the MMAs compare?",26,1
