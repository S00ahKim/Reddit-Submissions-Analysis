For anyone who's planning to go to the Oh My Girl Indio concert, but hasn't purchased tickets yet check out not just [kpopticket.us](https://kpopticket.us/), but also [Fantasy Springs Resort](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/) because you might be able to find a better seat at [Fantasy Springs Resort](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/).  There are still seats available in the second row in the center (Section B, Row B) likely because JSJ didn't properly announce with a chart, like they did for B.A.P with this  chart below, that there would be seats that are only for sale on [Fantasy Springs Resort](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/) and seats that are only for sale on [kpopticket.us](https://kpopticket.us). Though this chart may be slightly different from the one that they would have given for Oh My Girl if they had made one for them since certain sections are not for sale this time that were for sale for B.A.P's concert.

https://i.redd.it/gv1ndi9iyo721.jpg

This is from [Kpopticket.us](https://Kpopticket.us), but the chart below shows that row B, D, F... are blurred out and cannot be selected because those seats are for sale only at [Fantasy Springs Resort](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/). Also if you plan to buy tickets from [Fantasy Springs Resort's website](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/) be sure to purchase using a pc or mobile browser that has flash player because if you want to choose a specific seat you have to use the flash seat map and that requires flash player.

TL;DR If you're planning to get tickets to Oh My Girl's Indio concert at [Fantasy Springs Resort](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/) it's best to compare what seats are available at [Fantasy Springs Resort](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/) and [kpopticket.us](https://kpopticket.us) because they have different seats available for sale and it's likely, especially if you're planning to buy VVIP tickets ($120), that you can get better tickets on [Fantasy Springs Resort](https://www.fantasyspringsresort.com/oh-my-girl-2/). And use a pc or a mobile browser that has flash player since flash player is required to choose a specific seat using flash seat map.",2,1

[Here is all top 30 songs in the same graph.](https://imgur.com/BPG0gy5)

To help compare the songs that are closer in rank, here is the graph for songs [between rank 1 and 10](https://imgur.com/8PmH0xt), the graph for songs [between rank 10 and 20](https://imgur.com/bJWHfBu), and the graph for songs [between rank 20 and 30](https://imgur.com/ey8x2sd).

[**And here is the imgur album of all of them together.**](https://imgur.com/a/JGC5Lqc)

But by far the most interesting data to me is how some of these music videos stack against *the most viewed Kpop M/Vs of all time.*

[Here is a graph of the 50 most viewed Kpop songs of all time.](https://imgur.com/Oe7yEik)

*Big disclaimer: PSY's Gangnam Style, Gentleman, and Oppa is Just My Style are rank 1, 2, and 3 respectively. These videos are on such higher magnitudes, that I chose to omit them from the graph. But DDDD and DNA are getting pretty close to Oppa is Just My Style...*

All songs released in 2018 are solid lines. All songs released in 2017 are dashed lines. All songs released 2016 or earlier are dotted lines. The 2018 songs that made the top 50 are DDU-DU DDU-DU by Blackpink, Fake Love and Idol by BTS, Bboom Bboom by Momoland (they reached 300 million right before the year ended wow!), What Is Love? by Twice, Love Scenario by iKon, and Bad Boy by Red Velvet.

Here is the rankings right at the start of 2018, and the ending ranks of these songs at 2018.

**And of course all the discussion questions that I'd like to see answered.**

When the sheer amount of views for Fake Love came in and it was on track to surpass Bboom Bboom, I thought that it would be definitely be the most viewed M/V of 2018. *And then DDU-DU DDU-DU happened.* What do you think is the biggest contributor to how Blackpink could surpass BTS? Do you think the building hype due to such a long hiatus played a part?

The only songs that made the top 30 that were released before March were Bboom Bboom, Bad Boy, and Love Scenario, all of which made the top 10. You'd expect songs that release earlier in the year to do better on these top view lists cause they have simply been around longer. What songs from January and Febuary of this year should have made the top 30? Were you able to predict that Bboom Boom, a song released on January 3rd, would be one of the biggest hits of the year?

Love Scenario and Shine have some of the most consistent gains throughout the year. They don't follow the trend ""lots of views at first, but decreasing view rate over time"" that happens to other songs. Shine specifically got to its rank not from an explosive first month, but simply by its constant views, which is honestly amazing to me. Why do you think this is? Are their respective fandoms faithful to streaming views after all this time?

Surely to be expected, older classics like Fantastic Baby and I Got a Boy drop a lot ranks. Without a doubt, songs released last year and this year are getting view counts that are surpassing older songs. Should we attribute this to simply the growing entanglement of society and the internet? Or do you think there is a different reason? Larger amounts of coordinated streaming from fandoms? An increase of international fans?

And of course, discuss with others about how happy you are that your artist/group made the top 30! Or how about ""that song"" should have made the top 30 instead haha.

Happy New Years! And let one of the things to be excited for in 2019 are all the amazing songs that will be released!",38,1

This is your chance to choose the best-of-the-best in K-Pop for 2018!  Before we get started, here's a quick overview of the format and rules for this year's awards.

1.  Nominations and voting will be two separate processes.  Today begins the nominations.  The top 5 most upvoted nominations in each category will advance to the voting round, which will begin **January 8th**.

2.  Only nominate songs, albums, and performances released after December 11th, 2017 and artists that released new music after December 11th, 2017.  Because last year's awards began on that date, we will allow some overlap to prevent any gaps in coverage.

3.  Include a link to the relevant song/MV/album/performance that you are nominating.

4.  Do not post commentary or comments about the nominations in the nomination thread.  If you want to discuss the nominations, use this thread.

5.  **Search before you nominate!** Duplicate nominations will be removed.

The nomination threads are in **contest mode**.  That means the scores are hidden and they are sorted in random order.

**Try to be objective.**  This is not the census.  It's not about voting for your favorites.  We want to choose the best of 2018.  Give props where they are due.  Nominate and upvote the entries that you feel are **most deserving** of the awards, not just your personal favs.

### [Nominations are now open on /r/annualkpopawards](https://www.reddit.com/r/annualkpopawards/new/)

Nominations will end on January 7th.  
Voting will begin on January 8th.  
Winners will be announced on January 22nd.

Then you will find this post really interesting who knows it might even help you solve your obsession problem.

There  are a lot of crazy things that goes on in your brain it can be a good  thought, a crazy thought, an amazing idea, stupid idea and also  sometimes stuff which are truly offending to the human society(*you know what I mean!*). So our thoughts are the most important thing in our life, it literally decides our present future and everything else(*I know*)!  So what I mean is obsessions are due to the the feelings that we have  on somebody or something.We can never figure out an obsession in its  early stages because usually small actions that are performed by  individuals become a habit and later turns out to be an obsession, the  heart breaking truth is that we can never figure out an obsession before  it becomes an obsession.

Before jumping  into depth of this article this is not related to any medical OCD kind  of obsession or obsessions among people with disturbed mental state but  normal obsession over a person or a thing among us commoners.According  to my self realization there are so many ways you get into any obsession  lets see about each of them and later on see if there are any  solutions.Firstly one main reason for an obsession over an actor,single  or a social personality can come from PROCRASTINATION!! *Yes you read it right*.Around  70 to 75% of today's population are suffering from procrastination  syndrome where it can be a student who delays to complete his/her  homework, project, preparing for a test or an exam and also for  interviews.More about this can be seen in the below mentioned video  where he talks about procrastination.

[Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)

So  how is this related to obsessions?Yes, it is in order to delay the  start of your work because you are very bored to do that work makes you  watch videos, movies or series and also see popular music videos. In  this thousands of thousands of videos, one or the other video catches  your attention and then you listen/see it again until you are  satisfied.....after some time you want to still procrastinate so you  google about that video/song/actor/singer .After knowing more about that  song or actor comes ally of most problems, PEOPLE'S BIGGEST ENEMY IN  THEIR LIVES ""GOOGLE"" gives us recommendations where its either related  to that song or other videos of that actor/singer or also may be similar  videos.I cannot believe how technology can change the way we work,  think and also things we do.Its like technology is controlling human's  life and not the vice versa! OK, lets talk about that issue some other  time.So, this is how procrastination can lead to obsession.

The  next reason is because of your own interest but there is positivity in  these kinds of obsession because its something you would do even without  compulsion or influence and so it is not momentary it makes us discover  many other genres under that interest, makes you define your future  career so its called passion rather than obsession.There is a small line  between obsession and passion.                                   How do you differentiate between these  healthy and unhealthy obsession.We say its a healthy obsession if it  helps us improve, makes us steady, makes us bold in difficult situation  and also the most important one, rather than the other things motivating  us for our daily lives it teaches you to self motivate ourselves makes  our everyday and moment count.Obsessions which stops us from doing our  daily jobs, even though there is no logic it makes us believe in things  which just makes our feelings happy,(For example you would have broken  up with your boyfriend or girlfriend watching somebody who is similar to  your ex or a movie which is sort of similar to your life where your ex  is ideal ) so it make you stick to that moment because you don't want to  move on it make us get stuck at that moment so we don't think about  future we cannot live without such obsessions, these kind of obsessions  are extremely unhealthy.   There is also one more kind called fake  obsession which is similar to social conformity where you agree with  your group because everyone in the group agrees.In a fear of becoming an  outcast, if your group is obsessed with a band it makes you also to get  obsessed over that band .

What made me  think so deeply about obsession is, me as a person who tries to  understand everything around me,trying to find a logical reason about  everything, was obsessed over a simple thing which didn't have any  logical explanation which made me think about why people get obsessed to  a point where they cannot live without it.You might find answers on  wikihow on how to get over an obsession over a person or a thing but **what you won't find is about the obsession over a kpop artist**.  Now let's dig in deep with the overrated obsession of people over  actors/singers. Recently when I was going through my twitter and  Instagram since I'm a music person so obviously I click on music genre  while searching, what was so much like a blow/hit on my face kind of  truth was it was flooded with kpop posts.Initially I was irritated to  see so many of them and also only about them it wasn't something I was  looking for...then I shut my phone off thinking it was of no use because  they are trending everywhere which is something media calls a ""Korean  wave"". Even though I didn't go through it in detail what grabbed my  attention was the fan base that they had it was Global. Every country  had a group of these crazy, most dedicated and determined fan base that I  had never seen with other artists which made me think ""why are they so  famous"" that they even spoke in UN general assembly in UN youth  strategy2030 meet? you might have even guessed about which group I'm  talking about.Well they are also worth $3.6 billion which is equal to  the contribution of 26 mid-sized\[1\] companies .

[\[1\] k-pop's band worth.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/k-pops-bts-worth-3-6-billion-south-084730464.html)

And  then I realized this....For starters I do agree that they work hard,  talented bunch of people, but my main concern is that our youth are  getting obsessed over idols rather than getting obsessed over  ideals(ethics) which will help everybody improve in their own  way(field). It might seem like an ethics lecture for you guys but aren't  we making entertainment our obsessions? Which are the least of our  concerns when there is so much more going on in this world which needs  our attention. I'm not saying entertainment is not important, but these  obsessions in the name of entertainment and happiness are going  overboard. Moreover media shows all the stuff that they want their  audience to see. It's more like quick sand the more you struggle the  more you drown, the more audience go crazy the more they show only those  stuff to gain popularity, it can be positive or negative only victims  know the trouble of surviving it. The way they portray these people(band  members) without any flaws wants me doubt even more about them. Don't  you think it is too cliche to believe that they don't have any flaws,  come on guys! that can't be true they are humans! please let that not be  one of the reasons for your obsession. And lastly **I  have to appreciate their marketing skills about how to make everything  commercial(social media, technology, commercials and variety shows)**  it makes you feel like you live with them talk to them in everyday  life.That's a disaster you guys now you know why you are obsessed, more  than you searching for them they attack you everywhere online this  explains international fan base.

I would  like to close this story saying don't get obsessed over something that  doesn't take you anywhere, try to find some logic behind your obsession,  try to find an obsession that makes you successful. Sometimes in order  to do this make your feelings listen to your mind.Even though you are  successful in whatever you do in everyday life along with the obsession  you have over something else, remember it doesn't take you anywhere,find  the limit of an obsession to keep it healthy.There are so many ways in  which your country should change who knows you might be the one to  change whether in positive or negative way is left for you to decide.

**Find a healthy passion rather than a unhealthy obsession**...",0,1

I got into kpop in April of 2018 because I was looking for a dance style that I wanted to take classes in. In the end, because I knew that I would be looked down upon by my parents for being a fan (that sort of thing is taboo in my family) of anything, I just settled with hip hop/urban dance, which is also amazing. I've become a hardcore fan. Now I've been singing for quite a while, but my parents still haven't enrolled me in a hip hop dance class because they don't respect it (also, last year I was less confident in myself and was easily discouraged), and I'm taking Japanese in school because kpop idols are expected to know it and I LOVE the language SO MUCH (the grammar is amazing). Also, they don't teach Korean in school, so I am studying using a Korean grammar book and the wikipedia list of the top 6,000 most used words in the language. Because I know that I don't have the best body or face to be an idol, I have to do as much as I can to make up for this. That's why I want to become fluent in Japanese and Korean by the end of highschool and am doing a number of other activities to make me more of an *interesting* person with many talents to make the companies like me more. However, I still need to do well in school (I love school, but it has become a chore to keep a ""top of the class""-type reputation with work. I'm luckily still only 13 years old, but I'm still worried that I won't be good enough before I become too old to audition.

Is anyone else trying to become an idol like me? What are you doing to train? Please say I'm not alone.

Best wishes, and happy new year!",50,1

This post is not directed towards any specific k-fanbase.

Hi everyone! I have been in the world of K-pop for a lot of time (7 years) and I still have one unanswered question:
Why do some fans get really really angry when their biases get criticized?

What I mean is: if they really think that their biases are talented, why don't they just let them show what they are capable of instead of becoming extremely defensive?

For example: let's say I like Yuju (GFRIEND) and a person, online or irl, says that she is a really bad singer and should stop singing. A toxic fan would start becoming really defensive and mean just to ""protect"" Yuju, while a real fan would ignore the hate and would know that she is a good singer even if someone says she's not.

Why do they do that?

I think that this is the biggest problem in K-pop these days and fixing it would make the whole community a better place.",4,1

134,2019-01-02,2019,1,2,13,abpumk,Why are the terms cute and girl crush thrown around so easily these days?,LOONINEPERCENT,1546403372,"Its SO annoying. It annoys me to no end. People assume girl groups can only do cute or girl crush. They automatically assume that cute = submissive and girl crush = empowering to women.  nowadays when I see such words thrown around on my twt tl, I cringe real hard.

The moment a girl group is wearing white skirts and colorful crop tops or pastel colored dresses, its suddenly a cUtE cOnCePt. And if a girl group is wearing dark colors, dark makeup, fishnets, and lace-up boots, its gIrL cRuSh. 

Girls have way more colors than that. I love cute concepts and I love girl crush. But this erasure of other concepts needs to stop. There are plenty of concepts that exist that girls can do.

 Quirky concepts:
T-ARA, Momoland, Crayon Pop, Red Velvet, Pristin, Twice, Orange Caramel songs in general

 Sexy concepts:
AOA, Rainbow Blaxx, After School, Laysha, Hyuna, Sistar, Hyorin, Sunmi, Lee Hyori

 Jazzy concepts:
Mamamoo, Ladies Code, Red Velvet, some WG and SNSD songs, Lee Hi

 Retro concepts:
Wonder Girls, Yubin, EXID (I Love You), SNSD (Dancing Queen), KARA (Break It)

 Dark and/or scary concepts:
Dreamcatcher, Red Velvet (kinda), Ladies Code, 4Minute, f(x), 

 Sad/angsty concepts

Sunmi (Siren), Rainbow (To Me), KARA Seungyeon (Guilty), 4Minute (Hate)

 Band concepts

AOA, After School, Wonder Girls

 Magical concepts

WJSN, Oh My Girl, Loona, GWSN, Nature, Twice (kinda)

 Sassy, stylish, fashionable concepts

Gugudan (A Girl Like Me), Nature (Youll Be Mine), Loonas Heejin (ViViD)

Im sure theres much more out there. Girl groups are amazing no matter what they do. It just gets annoying when people milk the heck outta the words cute and girl crush. ",5,1

Im gonna throw out Eric Nam, because seriously I seem to discover him unexpectedly in so many places.

Mamamoo- Starry Night. It was just so pleasing to me to see all the different places being used efficiently for each member. I never even knew who Mamamoo was until I saw the m/v on MNET America channel.

Twice- What Is Love? It was fun seeing all the movie references and all the ""ships"" between the members.

Gfriend- TFTMN. I love the story it told within the m/v. It was deep and meaningful. I've actually spent hours reading theories about it on forums and whatnot.


So those are my favorite m/vs that came out in 2018. What was yours?",17,1

Lisa from Blackpink. Her eyes, nose, lips are so different and they stand out so much! She looks like an actual disney character.

Hwasa from Mamamoo. I love her slanted eyes, which give her such a hauntingly beautiful gaze. Also her thick thighs! I havent really seen that on another idol before. Its nice to see some body diversity :)",346,1

1. Hard to be a fan of Mamamoo because I find two of them quite dull (heard they're actually talented but like there is no wow factor with them whatsoever).
2. Blackpink, as a stan I do think they're a bubble waiting to POP.  It seemed as though they were the perfect group at one point but idk anymore.  Still a stan and will always be one cause Lisa is amazing.
3. Finally people are seeing how ""foxxy"" SM is.  I feel like we notice it, then it dies down.  But the YG hate is always on.  Let's not let SM keep getting passes.
4. Red velvet to snsd is what ikon is to big bang.  They make their bangers but they're kind of a let down.  Both groups have no wow factor to me, they're good at varieties but that's it.
5. BTS having no dating scandal after so many years, and also with that condom incident... hmmm something doesn't add up.  We all know they work a lot, but I bet they let out their ""love"" some way or another.  Either they're good at covering up or internal love affairs?
6. So many hypocrites when it comes to Hyuna.  Like first they're like ""man she gives no fucks, let her live her life"", then they also say ""what is she doing with that hair and make up, she should really fire her make up artist"".  I thought we were going to let her live her life??? #confused
7. NCT looks hella plastic.  Not saying they got it, but the visuals are good but strange.  Also they need to ditch their concept cause it ain't working.
8. Hard to make excuses for idols when I see G-idle? Soyeon.  Shows that hard work pays off.

@Me all you want, but I'm a fan of most of these groups.  Let's change the narrative that fans are close minded and will blindly defend their group on anything.",7,1

There are countless songs with the opposite, ie where they didnt get the appreciation they deserved in the charts even though the fan base loved it. 

But I cant personally think of any liked by the public and not the fans.

Obviously fans are fans of the group for a reason, but even so there are songs that fans dont particularly like (e.g. Ive heard many reveluvs dont like RBB, but it also didnt do as well in the charts).",129,1

Nothing special, just clips of people wearing blue jeans. I have no idea why I was watching it; probably was just up super late in a Youtube rabbit hole.

For some reason the video had a clip of Hwasa in it from their ""You're the Best"" MV. I immediately thought WHO IS THAT and WHY does she look so amazing in bluejeans -- I think I googled ""red hair k pop lady blue jeans"" and also combed through the comments before finding her name. And that led me to Mamamoo!

Anyone discover their favorite (or even not so favorite) group in a totally weird or random way?

288,2019-01-03,2019,1,3,18,ac4bcs,Disband Prediction Results,HL_328,1546509580,"Hey guys, last year I did a post predicting which K-Pop might disband in the year 2018. You guys came up with all these groups and today, I will be updating you guys on their current statuses! [OG post to anyone whose interested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7nery8/predictions_which_kpop_group_might_disband_in_2018/)

***Note: a group is considered disbanded if*** 

***a) The agency releases a statement confirming the disbandment.***

***b) Group member(s) confirm they have disbanded.***

Another note: if I missed your prediction, I apologize. There was around 300 comments on that post so there is bound to have some skipped.

Without further ado, these are the groups you guys predicted to disband in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

**KNK**

KNK did not disband but unfortunately member Youjin has left the group.

**T-ARA**

Despite the fact that the remaining members of T-ARA left MBK Entertainment, no one has claimed that they were disbanding.

**Wanna One**

Yeaaaa this one was expected to disband.

**Stellar**

Unfortunately, Stellar has disbanded. 

**Secret**

This was a messy disband with the members of Secret have legal and trust issues with TS Entertainment.

**Shinee**

Shinee still exists with us and is stronger than ever. 

**Boyfriend**

Boyfriend still exists with us today. 

**After School**

This is messy. There are rumours that they have disbanded but those are rumours. Nor Starship Entertainment or members of After School clarified that After School and subsequently Orange Caramel have disbanded.   

**Fiestar**

Fiestar has unfortunately disbanded. 

**Topp Dogg**

Despite the numerous changes to the line-up, Topp Dogg still exist today but with a rebranding. They are now known as Xeno-T.

**Boy's Republic**

They are currently on an indefinite hiatus with the future uncertain.

**Imfact**

Imfact did not disband. 

**H.U.B**

H.U.B did not disband.

**Girls Girls**

Girls Girls did not disband, however considering how small their company and how their last comeback was in 2016, they may have disbanded.

**Crayon Pop**

Crayon Pop is currently on an indefinite hiatus.

**WA$$UP**

WA$$UP did not disband.

**Cross Gene**

Cross Gene is doing better than ever and did not disband. 

**24K**

24K did not disband.

**B.A.P**

With B.A.P's current situation, it is likely that will disband sometime in 2019. As of currently speaking, they have not disband.

***If there is a group that has actually disbanded or vice versa in the list above, please comment below and I'll try to change it.***

LOONA's Hi High is my song of the year for example but I have a whole heap of things to say about Oh My Girl's Secret Garden and Pristin V's Get It as well. I'd also love  to hear what people's favourite albums and b-sides are. I've included 20 title tracks, 10 albums and a 10 side tracks in order but feel free to add more or less of each as you please

&amp;#x200B;

  

Twenty favourite feature tracks

1. LOONA  High Hi

As a LOONA fan since OEC this was everything I was hoping for as a full debut  a top tier pop song and MV that successfully brought together every previous strand of the group. I cried the first few times I heard it and havent stopped loving it since. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Oh My Girl  Secret Garden

A more than worthy follow up to Closer; for me this is the sound they do best and Im so happy it did well for them. I love the bittersweet melodies  they remind me a little of ABBAs The Winner Takes It All. I have to mention Seung Hees magnificent vocals here too  delivering just the right amount of drama at the coda

&amp;#x200B;

3. Pristin V  Get It

Pristin finally get the song they deserve (albeit as a subunit). It seems that this Reddit sub was the only one that didnt sleep on this sadly  a perfect, bad-ass mix of Swedish songwriting with Kpop

&amp;#x200B;

4. Twice  What Is Love /Dance The Night Away

Twice had their most consistent year for me. I cheated here a bit by picking two but both I really couldn't pick between them - both songs feature their effervescent pop at its best for me

&amp;#x200B;

5. WJSN  Dreams Come True

Every year I get knocked for six by a GG that Ive stupidly neglected before. This year it was WJSN in this amazing drama-packed song. Most seem to prefer Save Me, Save You which is great as well but this is the one that hasnt left my playlist since I first heard it

&amp;#x200B;

6. Black Pink  DDU-DU DDU-DU

Simply put, they absolutely smacked it out of the park with this one. I was never a big fan of them before personally but this one hit me hard

&amp;#x200B;

7. Fromis\_9  Love Bomb

This one took a while to grow on me but once that earworm of a chorus gets stuck  theres no going back. A modern Kpop classic for sure

&amp;#x200B;

8. Hoody  Sunshine

Hoodys best song so far for me. A great backbeat, quirky MV and those beautiful silky-smooth vocals that seem to envelop you. I could listen to this on loop for hours

&amp;#x200B;

9. (G)I-DLE  Hann

This one pips Latata for me as their best single, I love the hint of exoticism in it. It's Incredible that theyve built up such a distinctive sound and image in such a short space of time 

&amp;#x200B;

10. GWSN  Puzzle Moon

Another incredible GG debut. This one takes the style of f(x)s 4 Walls and, for me, improves on it. Great MV, superb choreography and the album was great too.  

&amp;#x200B;

11. Jay Park  V

12. Snuper  Tulips

13. Gugudan  The Boots

14. HEIZE  Jenga

15. April  My Mistake

16. APink  Im So Sick

17. Red Velvet  Power Up

18. Red Velvet  Bad Boy

19. NCT U  Baby Dont Stop

20. BoA  One Shot, Two Shot

&amp;#x200B;

A shout out to these amazing songs too

Yubin  Thank You Soooo Much

(G)I-DLE  Latata

GFriend  Time For The Moonlight

I was wondering if any of you guys discovered new music through kpop? This could be through group/idol recommendation or something random like a song played in an ad that a group/idol were featured in, etc. If you guys have any, what is the song(s) and how did you find it?

My examples would be:

1). Alina Baraz &amp; Galimatias - Fantasy

I saw a post from a Jisoo fan account that mentioned this as Jisoo's favorite song (over a year ago).

2). Beasts With No Name - Stole My Heart

BlackPink was in an Olens ad and the song was playing in the background. It sounded chill so I went looking for it.",33,1

For instance in NCT, while Doyoung often helps lead the group, I think he and Taeyong are very similar. On the other hand Johnny is a good contrast to Taeyong as he's a lot more outwardly playful and acts as a fun older brother type as opposed to Taeyong's surrogate parent type.

The show hasnt had any bad editing (IMO) and most of the contestants are highly skilled, charismatic, and ready for debut. Its really a matter of teamwork at this point. I genuinely believe that the group that comes out of this will be amazing (even if my favorites arent in it).

Maybe its because everyone more or less has the same favorites so there arent any feuds going on.

I just want to know if anyone is as oddly satisfied as I am about how this show is playing out?",1,1

464,2019-01-05,2019,1,5,8,aco5u4,Inspirations for k-pop producers,vousetti,1546644928,"So I've been wondering what influenced song's of the kpop girlgroup's that have cute concepts. To be exact I will give you some examples:  
[LOONA - Love &amp; Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K4b9Z9lSwc)  
[WJSN - Dreams Come True](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4fhBXWkAQ)  
[Lovelyz - Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_IBk0RCsOo)  
[Lovelyz - Ah-Choo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7qisJ_KuYI)  
[Lovelyz - Lost N Found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-lFzySUuQ)  
[Lovelyz - Hi\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbnRfBGjeaw)  
[GFRIEND -  Rough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VKcLPdY9lI)  
[APRIL - The Blue Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh_6PY9am_0)

As far as I know k-pop is literally mix of different genres and they mostly just put variety of styles in one, therefore I wonder from which songs and genres the producers could take the inspiration to create songs in this style since they seem to have some things in common. From what I've noticed the producers of this style love putting some dramatic violins and synths, more complex chords, sometimes I hear some [unexpected chromaticism](https://youtu.be/4NzUfvf6Mhs?t=46), sometimes I feel like a lot of melodies and chords just kind of don't go to the places that most of the people listening to generic western music would expect them to go?? So I'm just curious what songs outside of kpop have similar things in it and how these producers even come up with all these interesting chords, violin voicing and stuff.

Actually I've seen a lot of people saying that gfriend's and wjsn's songs sound japanese? like openings from anime? but honestly I've never seen any of these people giving some particular examples of songs that sound the same or at least a bit similar so I would be really grateful if somebody could link some songs that sound similar or just have some elements that could inspire this style.

Let's say you can create your own boy group with exsisting K-pop idols.  Who would you pick for each position and why (Where applicable)?

Heres my example:
Leader/Rap: RM (BTS)
A certified genius with great leadership skills.  Bilingual and can write a diss track like no ones business.
He's time and time again shown why he's the glue that sticks BTS together.

Lead Vocals: D.O. (EXO)
I don't think I have to explain this one.
He's a vocal powerhouse that can execute almost any style of music.  His range is ridiculous for idol singer standards, plus his baritone is sick.

Vocal: Kim Byeongkwan (A.C.E)
Great mid to high vocals but the entire A.C.E are underrated vocalist so anyone of them could have fit in here.

Dance/Rap: Ten (NCT)
This one was very difficult but I chose Ten because I feel hes an underrated dancer, thats not praised enough.
He just oozes charisma on stage when he dances with what seems like little effort on his part.

Visual/Rap: Hwi Young (SF9)
He has a look that just catches your eye.
Has a super model look to him too.
Watch Now or Never to get what I'm saying.

Maknae/Vocal: Jungkook (BTS)
He's the Golden Maknae enough said.

Note: The group doesn't have to make ""sense"" since this is just for fun.
You're also allowed to add as many members as you like.
Please remember to be respectful to each others opinions.",1,1

It needs some context, but; On Knowing Bros, Girls Generation did a skit where they looked into a ""mirror"" at another member. Yoona made fun of Sunny's height by saying she couldn't see her reflection, to which Sunny replied ""Where did they go?"" and then pointed to Yoona's chest. 

Also anything that comes out of Heechul's mouth.

If anyone wants more clarification, basically songs with

I was watching youtube highlights of a twitch streamer I watch regularly (Jakenbakelive [https://www.twitch.tv/jakenbakelive](https://www.twitch.tv/jakenbakelive)) and came across a clip of girls dancing with choreography along to a song I could best guess as Kpop. 

If someone could identify the song for me that would be great because neither shazam nor AHA on chrome could identify the song.  (here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLqjKq2RpqY&amp;t=559s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLqjKq2RpqY&amp;t=559s))

543,2019-01-05,2019,1,5,21,actpqw,Is anyone interested to sell/buy products in an online K-pop marketplace if there is one?,fiftywellsdeep,1546690905,"My friends and I are working on a project to build a kpop products only marketplace for fans to sell/buy some artistic/self-made kpop products &amp; all other fan merchandise. I've realised that my experience as a purchaser of Kpop products have been very painful because of the scam that's so rampant everywhere.

Paypal will be integrated onto the platform so as to prevent issues of scam and fraud (believe me we're both really sick of all these scam and fraud on twitter/fb/unofficial social media sites). 

We're just doing an interest check to see if anyone will be willing to use this website that we're making so we'll have a reason to code it out. What do you all think? We're thinking of charging a 2% transaction fee per product sold. 

All feedback/suggestions are very welcome. If you're interested please comment below with the items you'd like to buy or sell. I will contact you to give you more details about this project. 

Some support/comment/feedback will be very appreciated

Theres this one label that has now opened for online auditions, and Im a good dancer (I study dance as that is my dream job) and Im an average singer. 

Ever since the poster came out for this company I have been contemplating for a while. Its not a massive company like SM or YG, theyre a fairly new company, for trainees, however the name and people who run are actually extremely famous music video directors who have directed people such as wannaone, sori, sistar etc. 

One of their trainees had participated on PD48 and shes a mixed korean, being half white. So theyre not too picky (im half asian as well) 

Im quite stumped as to wether I should apply? If apply with the objective that its an experience not keeping my hopes up, my dancing is my strongest aspect and Ive got a lot of hard training done throughout the years of my 17 years of life. I go to an extremely strict dance school who gives us monthly assessments and monitors weight etc so I am aware and prepared for the struggles of a trainee. 

Please give me some good advice! x",5,1

It took me some months to discover discography of newer groups, I already fell in love with Seventeen and after it I started recognizing another old and new groups as well. Recently I understood how good songs of SM artist are (Im not saying that songs of other companies are bad, of course not, its just I listen so SM artists more often).

Personally I think if Stray Kids keep going in the direction they are, they will be one of the top boy groups in the next few years. Although I love Loona, I feel that if BBC dont change their promo strategy they wont blow up the way they deserve to. Im kinda indifferent about G-idle because their girl crush concept is nothing new and has been done to death but I feel like they may be super successful too. (If they drop the ethnic concept).",54,1

",griffbendor,1546808445,"Hello, and welcome to another round of a year in review of 2018 at your good ol r/kpop Jukebox! Last week was the first part, with artists such as EXO, TWICE, J-Hope, and more up for review! The highest ranked song from last week was **Apinks Im so sick** with an overall score of **9.15**! They now have the 6th highest ranked r/kpop Jukebox song of all time, congratulations Apink! You can see the rest of the scores [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox/2019_reviews). 

After highlighting those seven songs from last week, we have another round of standout songs from 2018 ready for your review! Yep, these threads serve as a purpose for you (yes, you! You who is reading this) to discuss seven somewhat randomly selected k-pop songs from 2018 (can you believe that was already last year?) that were quite noteable. What songs are on Jukebox this week meant to be some of the more highlighted songs from this year? Lets find out! Heres the year-in-review songs:

1. [Red Velvet - Power Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiHSVQy9xN8)
2. [BTS - Fake Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C2z4GqqS5E)
3. [Sunmi - Siren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWMZIf7eSg)
4. [MV] [NCT Dream - We Go Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV1Es22E0RI)
5. [April - Oh! My Mistake (  )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2MhwXZ8IgM)
6. [IZ*ONE - La Vie En Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwr2a_lFWY)
7. [Mino - Fiance ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY8VGNft-Zc)

If you missed last weeks thread, heres a summary of what to do! These seven songs are up for review, so you get to talk about them and leave any thoughts, be they praise or criticism, about the song! Just remember to keep your comments on the song, not the artists themselves. Alongside your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10, with a score of 1 being the lowest (you want this song to GET AWAY OUT OF YOUR FACE) and 10 being the highest (This song makes you wanna POWER UP!). If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you may leave a review of the MV as well - totally optional and up to you! You can review either one or all seven songs, totally up to you! If you are still a bit confused/unclear as what to do, you can always [refer to the very first Jukebox thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/). 

I will leave reviews for songs open all week until the upcoming Friday at 11:59 PM PST. Thats not a strict deadline - it just makes it easier for me to calculate scores to reveal in the following Jukebox thread + wiki.

&amp;nbsp;

The focus of this one will be an update as to what they've been up to since their last comeback was in July 2017.  With them being out for so long, it's understandable that some have lost interest/track of them or probably never heard of them, so hopefully this post will bring some awareness to them.

#Introduction
**KNK** (Korean: , Romanization: KeuNaKeun, Japanese: ) is a five-member boy group under **220 Entertainment**. Previously, they were under **YNB Entertainment**, but no longer exists since [at least May 2018](https://twitter.com/bestiny_hr/status/991232683274518529) (I'll go into detail in another section).

The current members of KNK are: **[Park Seoham](https://i.imgur.com/TXbljOM.jpg)**, **[Lee Dongwon](https://i.imgur.com/67lraKO.jpg)**, **[Jeong Inseong](https://i.imgur.com/3agEssC.jpg)**, **[Kim Jihun](https://i.imgur.com/6l6HuAk.jpg)**, and **[Oh Heejun](https://i.imgur.com/aScmgoR.jpg)**. **[Kim Youjin](https://i.imgur.com/K9HzILJ.jpg)** was a previous member of KNK but unfortunately left due to his panic disorder. [You can and I suggest you should read his last fancafe letter](https://imgur.com/a/dgOfMuL).

---
#Pre-debut (~2012 - 2016)

**Youjin** was a former TS trainee and [trained with BAP](https://youtu.be/1n9oFXs-Br4?t=15s).  There was a rumor that he became a YNB trainee since he followed a TS manager there and it lines up with the fact that one of YNB's managers was [Secret's](https://www.instagram.com/p/lWPozdM0dI/).

&amp;nbsp;

**Seoham** along with **Inseong** were [Bighit trainees and trained with BTS](https://youtu.be/1XFqxk-IzMY?t=15s). Seoham in a way stumbled his way in being idol as he [originally dreamt of being a language teacher](http://keunakeun.tumblr.com/post/142138252148) and became a trainee after following his friend to an SM audition. From there, SM sent him to JYP and on his way there was street casted by Bighit. Eventually, he did become a JYP trainee for acting. Also going to mention that another YNB manager, **Han Daejin** was 2AM's manager spoiler, he's going to play a bigger role.

&amp;nbsp;

After Bighit, **Inseong** became a trainee at FNC, along with **Heejun** and **Dongwon**. All three appeared in FNC's reality show [Cheongdamdong 111](http://kshow123.net/show/cheongdamdong-111/). At the time, both JYP and FNC were located at Cheongdam so [Seoham met with Inseong everyday](https://www.vlive.tv/video/5468?begin=345). Inseong and Heejun eventually followed Seoham to YNB. However, **Dongwon** [became injured and stopped being a trainee](https://www.vlive.tv/video/105937?begin=347). 

&amp;nbsp;

**Jihun** actually joined YNB because of **Dahye** as both were in SM Academy. For more of a coincidence, his high school was nearby Seoham's grandmother's place and I believe he would walk by her place as he went to school. 

&amp;nbsp;

There was a [rumor that they were supposed debut in 2014](https://www.instiz.net//pt/2062934) along with former YNB trainee, Lee Hwan. This actually lines up with the fact that they had debut song *Knock* for about 2 years. You can see how the song and choreo changed when comparing the original [choreo](https://twitter.com/KNKOfficialYNB/status/843423602707845120) and [melody](https://www.vlive.tv/video/14070?begin=148) to what we [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1NPO-H06xU) [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYVDIZcb6Og).

#Debut to MIXNINE (2016 - 2018)

KNK finally debuted with [KNOCK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYVDIZcb6Og) on March 3, 2016. Following their debut, they came back with [BACK AGAIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp34Lfv3OLc) and [U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8sfxDj9OJ4) in 2016 and [Sun.Moon.Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy6w5yKG7jU) and [Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MWc2NXtit4) in 2017 (For more details, please see the original Spotlight post).


&amp;nbsp;

In addition, they debuted in Japan on October 11, 2017 with the release of their debut singleU / BACK AGAIN. Even before their debut, they started doing activities in Japan, starting January 2017. Their activities in Japan has been pretty consistent, even in 2018 and 2019, with fanmeetings and performances every few months.

&amp;nbsp;

In November, they joined MIXNINE, with Seoham, Inseong, and Heejun passing the auditions. At the time, people weren't entirely sure of this though, because [they did not appear in the music video](https://youtu.be/ypKZrs5uSkg) as they were in Japan during the filming. They were all eventually eliminated, like everybody else involved.

---
#YNB's demise
This section will be full of rumors so take it with a grain of salt, but with how things played out, they could be true.

&amp;nbsp;

In March 2018, a rumor from I think originally thequoo that talked about how staff have not been payed for 3 months, Youjin being sick, they have the songs but not the money for a comeback, and how KNK wanted to hold fanmeetings as they were getting nervous. (The OP is a friend of the staff.) Fans even found that one of their former managers now works for [Plan A](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhdoJjRgQEn/?taken-by=minjae86_seo). At the same time, the KNK staff tweeted that their weekly show [*My KNK TV* will go on hiatus for a week](https://twitter.com/KNK_STAFF/status/975990874952929280) ([Trans](https://twitter.com/Official_Tinks/status/975992042793746432)). It's still on hiatus. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also going to mention the fact that YNB used to have 5 artists in 2017Noel, Almeng, 40, BESTie, and KNK. The thing is, 40's, Almeng's, and Noel's latest releases while under YNB were in 2016, BESTie's was in 2015. So it should be unsurprising that:

- 40 left in [July 2017](http://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/1OIG2CQAV3) then signed to LIMEZ Entertainment.

- Uji + Dahye left in [September 2017](https://www.soompi.com/2017/09/04/besties-uji-dahye-terminate-contracts-agency-leave-group/) + Uji signed to [Curo Holdings Management](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/12/former-bestie-member-uji-signs-with-curo-holdings-management)

- Noel left in January 2018 and signed under [Cjes](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdrknk7H8W6/)

- For Almeng, I wasn't able to find an article for them but they left in 2017 since YNB took them off their website during that time.

&amp;nbsp;

In April, KNK released a digital single *Closer.* Someone found that the [photo](https://i.imgur.com/IuCtMgP.png) for the album is a [free-to-use image](https://twitter.com/gegepls/status/990256807749791744) and even the image provided of [Inseong, Jihun, and Heejun](https://i.imgur.com/7ay1RLz.jpg) was an unused photo from their [fanclub ](https://twitter.com/knkhoon/status/941244964360503296) [photobook](https://twitter.com/PURE_SCENT1/status/940860664519774209).

&amp;nbsp;

In May, a BESTie fan found their [office to be empty](https://twitter.com/bestiny_hr/status/991232683274518529). Here's how it look like in [January](https://twitter.com/BESTiny_gac/status/992065829201051648) for comparison.

&amp;nbsp;

There wasn't confirmation of what happened with YNB until KNK removed any mention of YNB from their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KNKOfficial220) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/knk_official_knk/) in July, although their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/knkofficial.ynb/) still has YNB for some reason. A few days later, YNB's website was no longer available, confirming its shut down.

---
#Youjin's departure

Despite the [staff saying all the members were fine](https://twitter.com/nikpann/status/984467916128227328), Youjin [halted activities with KNK due to his panic disorder in April](https://redd.it/8dldyk). 

Between April and September, the staff updated in the fancafe stating he was receiving treatment and to support him, they [uploaded unreleased photos of all 5 of them](https://www.instagram.com/p/BicRECCD6VI/), Seoham changed his [fancafe photo](https://imgur.com/a/o58G1ov) to one from BACK AGAIN, [Youjin gave his signature to a fan](https://twitter.com/jeongstokki/status/1014132763115466752), and staff allowed for fans to give mail and gifts for all 5 for their August performances in Japan.

Unfortunately in September, it was announced that [Youjin was leaving the group](https://redd.it/9eima5). Since then, he has deleted his fancafe account, but one silver lining is recently [someone saw him in the subway looking happy](https://twitter.com/bugiwoos/status/1080509101006774274).

---
#KNK's response
KNK been pretty open about Youjin's departure compared with other groups that have gone through a member leaving. 

After it was announce he was leaving, all of them wrote letters regarding the situation:

- [Seoham's](https://twitter.com/nikpann/status/1039142784349790208?s=21) ([Imgur mirror](https://i.imgur.com/jhgAr9H.jpg))

- [Inseong's](https://twitter.com/adellewxm/status/1039214283668709376?s=21) ([Imgur mirror](https://imgur.com/a/UEGD1tn))

- [Jihun's](https://twitter.com/adellewxm/status/1039329243992190976) ([Imgur mirror](https://imgur.com/a/FbErmfv))

- [Heejun's](https://twitter.com/nikpann/status/1039191285154766849?s=21) ([Imgur mirror](https://i.imgur.com/83EbaWr.jpg))

Not only that, but Seoham mentioned it in [his interview with CAMPUS CUT](https://i.imgur.com/phkx3FW.jpg) and said he was grateful for Youjin in his [Christmas letter](https://twitter.com/nikpann/status/1077227441431535616) and Jihun mentioned it [when he announced a new member, aka Dongwon, into the group](https://redd.it/a7ipp0).

---
#In search of a company

Back in September, there was a rumor of them joining [Main Entertainment](http://maincompany.co.kr/) because KNK changed their [temporary address](https://twitter.com/KNK_Tinkerbells/status/1040927663156867082) to where [Main Ent. is located](http://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=knk&amp;no=21038&amp;page=1). This made sense since [Main Ent. is the company producing the Addicted remake](https://twitter.com/YABEMASAKl/status/1045731799878578177) that [Seoham is rumored in](https://twitter.com/TrendingWeibo/status/1045666134098411521). However, this was ultimately denied [by the CEO](https://twitter.com/nikpann/status/1052979883192668160).

Afterwards, there have been rumors of them [starting their own company](https://twitter.com/nikpann/status/1053152508577701888) since October. This was more-or-less confirmed in [retail sites](https://twitter.com/knknewsbot/status/1080415994927972352) for pre-orders of Lonely Night. 220 Entertainment is named as such due to it being the birthday of the YNB manager that stayed with them, Han Daejin. Not much information is available as of yet but hopefully they'll say something about it soon.

---
#Dongwon's addition

In December, Jihun announced that they were adding a new member as they felt their performance felt incomplete with only the 4 of them.

Before being added, Dongwon [attended a](https://twitter.com/KNK_areum/status/850754050358362112) [few of their concerts](https://twitter.com/SeungJun_SM/status/1078946726675791874) and [made a](https://www.vlive.tv/video/23259) [few appearances](https://twitter.com/smolHeej/status/1075566020306317312) [in their Vlives](https://www.vlive.tv/video/10141?begin=900), going as far as during BACK AGAIN.

To see how he fits in, I [suggest watching their Christmas Vlive](https://www.vlive.tv/video/105937) where he first made his appearance.

---

#Closing

Their comeback is in an hour. Honestly, just watch their MV and see if they interest you. Not only that, but they also have a [US tour coming up](https://imgur.com/a/kpL3xSy) in February and March and they are planning a tour in Europe.


I would also suggest going to the [original Spotlight](https://redd.it/77yxcr) since it expands more on them in terms of their music and variety. ",9,1

Here's mine:

10. Pristin V - Get It (Ooh. That's all I got)

9.  fromis\_9 - To Heart (Just some poppy fun. Great debut for me)

8. EXO - Love Shot (I'm really convinced that they released Tempo first as a teaser. Not that I didn't like Tempo)

7. Penomeco ft. Crush - No. 5 (Let's all let Crush sing the chorus, shall we?)

6.  Twice - Yes or Yes (Twice really has that formula of getting their songs stuck in your head, don't they?)

5.  Wisue - What A Beautiful Night (Not that well known internationally i think? but really glad i stumbled onto her)

4. NCT U - Baby Don't Stop (Why you whisperin' tho?)

3. day6 - Days Gone By (Gotta love that retro feel. And completely different from what they've done)

2.  Shaun - Way Back Home (I admit, I only listened to this song because of the sajaegi accusations. But wow, really, really   
great song and endless repeats)

1. BTS (Jungkook) - Euphoria (No question the top song for me last year. Maybe I'm just a sucker for uplifting EDM type songs)

Now I was born in Korea so I have listen to KPop my whole life.
And I cannot deny how popular Blackpink is right now. I mean the   is getting bigger and bigger and there is no denying that.
I mean even Hyukoh is coming and much lesser known Jambinai.
And not kpop but never expected Perfume to come too, just like how X Japan came to coachella last year.

But as an avid Coachella goer. I dont think they deserve the sub headline spot.
The other sub headliners like Janelle Monae, the 1975, Diplo, and DJ Snake are much bigger names than BP in the US
While I think Blackpink still have long ways to go.

The one thing Im really worried about though is their set.
Artists at coachella usually gets 35-45min for their set. Hyukoh will probably get about 40min and Jambinai will probably get about 35min.

But sub headliners get 50-80+ min for their set. While Headliners get 75-90+min.
Blackpink currently do not have enough songs to cover their whole set even with Jennies solo and they do not have choreography for all of their songs. And I doubt YG will give them full album between now and April. 

I really want them to do well here, but at the same time Im worried about the backlash they might get if it doesnt work out at all.

Just want to know what you guys think.",11,1

I know that Kpop is always fast-paced and people try to release songs a couple times of year, especially rookies. However, are there times when you felt like comebacks were too rushed? Did you ever get sick of any groups because they released too much? What is your optimum comeback rate? 

For me, I know that multiple comebacks are good and all but I got kinda tired of iKon after a while. Like, I liked the songs but I didn't have that adrenaline(?) by the time the 3rd song got released. I felt the same with TWICE too after a while especially if you factor in the Japanese releases.

So my questions to you are:

* are there any currently? 
* have there ever been any and if so, did your opinion of them change and how / why?
* do you ever feel obligated to like every member, is there any guilt / consciousness associated with not liking or caring for a member? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, obviously, that's a lot but you don't have to answer every question, it's just there to help encourage and further discussion! Also, take note that this isn't about groups that you got into recently / aren't familiar with because that kind of beats the point. If you've gotten into a group only recently, chances are, you aren't really that familiar with the members to begin with. This is about groups that you're very familiar with, know every member of and are at least somewhat invested in. ",9,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/adr6tq/_/edjv2lx

&gt;Truthfully, sometimes companies claim idols died from disease or an accident when in reality they committed suicide (to cover up the fact that idols live under extreme scrutiny and stress). Not saying it happened in these cases, but to take these kind of news with a grain of salt.

Edit: Err, not sure why I'm getting downvoted. This has clearly happened before:

https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/03/26/100-seo-min-woo-dead-drug-overdose/

The article actually mentions the exact same issue.

Indeed, cardiac arrest is often a cause-of-death tied to overdoses for younger people, either as a direct result of drug abuse or an intentional cover-up.

This also aligns with the fact that suicides in Korea are considered extremely shameful and a person's own fault.

South Korea has far and away the highestsuicide rateamong the 35 wealthy Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries  almost 40 Koreans fall victim to suicide every day, almost 50 percent higher than the second-ranked OECD country, Hungary. Almost 95 percent of Koreans report being stressed, a third of them chronically. According to one study, up to 28 percent of elderly Koreans are depressed, compared with 10 to 15 percent in the U.S.

Girls generation, T-ara, Secret, Miss A and whole lot of girl groups was at that era.

And I think hundreds of songs came out then was much varies and has its own color. 

But bands these days, i think its really 'equalized'. I mean, I cant find any difference between them.

For example, in case of Girls' Generation' s &lt;Gee&gt;, can you even imagine secret or T-ara sings that? I cant.

But, in my case, i cant feel any discomfort if i imagine that red velvet sings twice's  &lt;TT&gt;.

Girl groups today are mostly concepted with common image, and same sense of beats.

I think there're also effect of current music trend of TRAP music and retirement of original producers make beats feel common.

And I think thats the reason why many middle-size entertainment's  bands are not really powerful compared to the past.

I hope girls groups going to debut after days have more various concepts and styles.

I just finished watching iKON's ""I'm OK"" music video, and while that shot of B.I in front of that exploding car is truly stunning, it also had me thinking: What's the deal with exploding cars/cars on fire in K-Pop music videos? I know there's a few BTS music videos where there are cars on fire too (""Fire"", ""Mic Drop""), and I am sure that there are a few more music videos out there that do the whole 'burning car' thing.",65,1

[Boy band BTS](https://i.redd.it/28hqrvgt9d921.jpg)

**WIKITREE -** A South Korean ruling party lawmaker said Wednesday he will push for a concert of Korean singers, including world-famous boy band BTS, in North Korea this fall.

Rep. Ahn Min-seok of the Democratic Party told Yonhap News Agency that he contacted BTS' agents last month to inquire whether the band could take part in a concert he will push for at the Rungrado May Day Stadium in Pyongyang, the North's capital, in September.

Ahn, who serves as the chairman of the National Assembly Committee on Culture, Sports and Tourism and leads his party's special committee on inter-Korean cultural and sports cooperation, said that the Pyongyang concert will be promoted to celebrate last September's inter-Korean summit in the North.

During his visit to Pyongyang at that time, President Moon Jae-in gave a landmark speech in front of about 150,000 Pyongyang citizens at the May Day stadium.

""Late last year, I proposed to BTS agents that the band appear in the Pyongyang concert and asked them whether its timing can be arranged,"" Ahn said by phone.

The lawmaker said he expects the participation of BTS and other top Korean singers in the concert to help spread popular culture of the free world among Pyongyang citizens.

He also expressed hope that renovation of the May Day stadium will be completed prior to the September concert, though its feasibility will depend on the outcomes of the North's further summits with the United States and South Korea.

Ahn, who visited Pyongyang three times last year, said he has been asked by the North to help with improvements to the May Day stadium's grass and facilities.",1,1

It must be intensely bittersweet to perform the songs. 

The most infamous example would probably be [Heo Chanmi covering Into The New World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGliBjxyDkI) on Produce 101. She got cut from SNSD's lineup before debut and then screwed up the high note on the show, dooming her best 2nd chance at success.

And while NCT is not necessarily a rookie group, we are getting a new sub unit with new members so Im excited to see what their style will be. 

For BigHits new group, I expect them to be the complete opposite of BTS. More cutesy more of a softer sound all young youthful boys. Perhaps a debut similar to ASTRO or Boyfriend

As for any other boy groups in the making for now I hope 2019 is kind to these boys and Im looking forward to what the trend will be among boy groups of 2019.

There has been some discussion over whether Jennie is saying """" /piti/ or ""b\*\*ch"" /bt/. This can be easily confirmed by looking at the first vowel! If the first vowel is /i/, a tense high front vowel, she is saying '' (light), and if she is saying //, the lax counterpart, she is saying 'b\*\*ch'

First pic is the sound in question, /C\_C/, and the second pic is her saying  /mian/, which contains the tense high front vowel /i/. If Jennie is saying  /piti/, then the first vowel should look the same in both figures. However, the values show that the first formant is lower in the second figure (indicating a higher vowel), and the second formant is higher in the second figure as well (indicating a fronter vowel). Thus the two vowels are NOT the same and the vowel in question cannot be /i/, which leads to the conclusion that she is indeed saying ""b\*\*ch"".

Thanks for attending my TED talk.

I usually have trouble telling voices and vocal tones apart, which sucks, but I also really appreciate the visual aspects of kpop more; the choreography, MV sets and stage concepts that they utilise in kpop are so much more entertaining compared to Western Music!

A bit new to the K-Pop scene and have been thinking lately about K-Pop fandom names. Personally, I've been listening to a lot of Twice and a recently Blackpink. I had the thought of combining the fandoms (ONCE and BLINK) into WINK. One, because of the phonetics, the 'W' sound from ONCE and '-ink' from Blink. Also since technically a wink is 'blink' with 'one' eye. 

Is this something that's generally done with fandoms and are there any other fandom combinations that just kinda work in more ways than one?",42,1

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't really know much about Kpop, But I do know a lot about how people generalize everything.

for example, when they say that almost all kpop idols get plastic surgery (Is it a fact are is it a lot of them but not all of them?) 

  
If all of this is true... why would anyone want to be a kpop Idol? is it true they don't have any creative liberty? 

Sometimes these kinds of videos take some examples and try to past it like this is the norm so get some clicks. so that's why i'M trying to look at the other side of the medal, 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it true that all every  Kpop idols are forced to get plastic surgery? 

is true that they don't have any artistic liberty about how they dress or musical creativity?

At the turn of the new year, I've decided to add another feature where I'll put which charts the songs are still charting on two weeks later. The reason for doing this is because peak positions are only a small aspect of a song's success and can sometimes be misleading. Some songs chart high right upon release but then drop off dramatically the next day. Other songs stick around on the charts for a while. So hopefully this feature will be able to give you an idea of the longevity the songs have. I will attach graphs of the realtime charts for the two days leading up to the two weeks later mark so you can see charting positions at this point in time. I'll only include charts where the songs are sill consistently charting. Please let me know if anything is unclear and/or if anything can be improved.

I was wonder, what kpop songs do you know about life of an idol/life in the kpop industry?

Sunmi 'Black Pearl' - lyrics are about being an idol/being famous, outside it looks like a perfect life, while the truth is different

NCT 127 'My Van' - song talks about riding from one event to another, being tired of endless schedules

I know these two, but are there more like this?

I usually even come to appreciate songs that I hate if I give them a few listens but FL just got worse and worse on relistening so much so that I literally can't listen to it at all. It's really funny since it was in all the top songs of 2018 lists. I actually like Idol better believe it or not. This has never happened to me with a BTS song..I even came to love DNA after some time. 

Solo for obvious reasons lol but in all seriousness, I actually liked the lyrics depicting a girl going through a bad breakup and going fuck it, I shine by myself too, I don't need a man to do that. It felt more empowering to me personally than say 3D. But now when I listen to it, I feel like the sentiments were a little disingenuous and it dulls the impact of the song but that's just me.

If you look up an SM MV from before the previous year and even some 2018 ones, they seem to have restored the original thumbnail, ie, removing the notable SM TOWN Official logo that seemed uniform across all videos. 
  
Normally I wouldn't care much about this but I remember this was kind of a small issue because I remember people noticing old TVXQ videos were specifically thumbnail changed to only have Yunho or Changmin on them so it's [nice to see some OT5 memories](https://i.imgur.com/lNkxB4L.jpg).  Also the default thumbnails have the benefit of capturing extremely awkward moments, so you know what that means!
   
I'm sure this may get fixed in time but in the meantime, please share any silly looking thumbnails you may find for example, here's [Wendy about to serenade me](https://i.imgur.com/M1Xd0R0.jpg), [WinWin believing he can fly](https://i.imgur.com/QsqKBJ5.jpg) and, uh, [this Genie thumbnail that I don't think was the best choice](https://i.imgur.com/ZICQaOx.jpg)",16,1

Examples of songs-

NCT U- 7th Sense

The first 20 seconds and last 30 seconds of this song are what draw me in plus the take it slow part, I could care less for the rest.

Stray Kids- My Pace

The nanana part and the end of the bridge with the i dont know part are my standouts.

IZ*ONE - La Vie En Rose

Only liked the beginning of the chorus part where they sip tea.

Anyone else have this where they only like one part alot but just end up tolerating the rest of the song to get there?

I've always had a habit of mimicking something I like from someone who I like (sorry that's a bit complex to read) and these days I tend to : 

- pull the drawstrings of my hoodie really tight till it almost covers my entire face. I saw woozi do this once and as a homebody/bedbody myself, I can't believe this is something I had to see someone do first lol. 

- I press my lips really thinly together by default now. It's a face I'm really comfortable making when in public and I know I actually look presentable ~~lowkey adorable~~ so yeah haha

- I'm pretty sure I saw Hoshi wiggle his wrists and I'm almost always doing that now, especially when I'm taking a walk or something.

Then I just got to thinking about all the different positions in kpop and how we all would have interesting lists... top 10 main vocals, top 10 maknaes, top 10 visuals, top 10 dancers, top 10 leaders, top 10 '97 liners (if you want to get oddly specific)... etc. I feel like we all have kpop positions we are drawn to and have strong opinions about. 

This may not be a fun post for those of you who aren't multifandom, but I thought it could be a fun way to shed some light on idols and maybe introduce each other to idols/groups we're not familiar with - make suggestions for idols for each of us to listen to based on our lists. Obviously these are all based on personal opinions and not facts so let's all be nice to each other, ok?

1346,2019-01-13,2019,1,13,2,af9mxr,"What is the most iconic, unique and powerful groups' name in Kpop history?",RUMAXIS,1547314882,"I think for one, **TVXQ! is the most unique, special, iconic, complicated and powerful name ever in the history of all groups, not just Kpop.** Most groups name are usually taken from english letters and shortened form (eg: Bigbang or B.A.P), or just something cliche you pull from English words like Teen Top or Tiara for example. Eventhough they sound good and seems pretty nice, it's nothing new and special tbh.. TVXQ! on the other hand is a brand new name that has never been seen before, nothing **was** and **will** be able to match this most iconic name ever, allow me to elaborate on this further...

**TVXQ!** or **TVfXQ!** is an initialism for **Tong Vfang Xien Qi** (Chinese: ****). 

In Japan they are known as **THSK**; an initialism for **TOHOSHINKI** (Japanese: ****)

While in Korea, they are known as **DBSK**, an abbreviation of their Korean name **Dong Bang Shin Ki**(Hangul: ****)

Their name in english literally translate to **Gods Of The East**

Do you notice something?? **This is a play of 4 syllables words, something that holds a special meaning in Eastern mythology**, it even worked for their english names

DONG BANG SHIN KI /     / D B S K
TO HO SHIN KI /     / T H S K
TONG VFANG XIEN QI /     / T V X Q!
GODS OF THE EAST / G O T E

There are also the facts that the members stage names are also consisted of 4 syllables words play...:

U-Know Yunho 
Hero Jaejoong/Youngwoong Jaejoong
Micky Yoochun
XIAH Junsu
Choikang Changmin/MAX Changmin/MAXIMUM Changmin


U(1) KNOW(2) YUN(3) HO(4)

HE(1) RO(2) JAE(3) JOONG(4) / YOUNG(1) WOONG(2) JAE(3) JOONG(4)

MIC(1) KY(2) YOO(3) CHUN(4)

XI(1) AH(2) JUN(3) SU(4)

CHOI(1) KANG(2) CHANG(3) MIN(4)

MAX Changmin is the short term for MAXIMUM Changmin which orginated from Choikang Changmin, they worked for 3 and 5 syllables words play but not 4 so i'll give you that one lol...

Number 4 also hold a special meaning in eastern mythology, it can be considered bad luck or something along the line (*the lawsuits and seperation lol?*)

What about their fandoms name? Well for one, we all know TVXQ! have 2 official names for their fanclubs. The first one is called **Cassiopeia** for their Korean and worldwide fans, the 2nd one is called **BIGEAST** for their Japanese only fans.

**What is Cassiopeia??? Well, Cassiopeia is a constellation as you all know. Cassiopeia as a fandom name is very symbolic. Both of them and their fans. Cassiopeia is a constellation with 5 points in the night sky, coincidentally enough these five points if lined up on a keyboard connect the letters T, V, F, X, and Q (which formed TVfXQ!) and it also formed the shaped of *W*, something that symbolize DBSK since the beginning of their debut. It also made sense why there is one of JYJ's song called W, which is a message to their fans and Yunho/Changmin**. No matter where you are, on earth and in life..no matter what you are going through or how you are feeling.Look up in the night sky and youll see TVfXQ!...Our cassiopeia right there with you.. Illuminating your dark night and being right there besides you no matter what. They are there besides each and everyone of us giving us light and hope.and as Cassiopeia we illuminate right back for them, as much as they are there for us, we are there for them. The audience and TVfXQ as one. As Cassiopeia. As the Red Ocean, an unstoppable wave. 

**The ""W"" shaped by Cassiopeia formed the words TVfXQ! while the letters of TVfXQ! while lined up together on keyboard formed the shaped of ""W"". This means they are always one and relies on each other**

It can also be interpret as the shaped of ""W"" formed by Cassiopeia is a constellation under the sky ruled amd watched by TVfXQ! (*since they are the Gods Of The East apparently lol*). That or maybe the shaped ""W"" formed by Cassiopeia in the sky is also a symbol to tell us that *""This is TVfXQ!'s territory and all of us are under their reign bitches* lol... 

When you read the lyrics of **Rising Sun, Tri-Angle, Free Your Mind, MAXIMUM, Android, Creation, One Kiss, MINE, In Our Time, Break Out!, Survivor, Humanoids, 'O' Jung Ban Hap, Hide and Seek, FATED, Refuse To Lose, Ai Wo Motto, Believe In You and many of their other songs**, you would realized how much they inserted eastern influence in the production of their music/arts/lyrics and such.. They are literally preaching about social issues, war, peace, love, corruptions and self-awareness like.... *these guys are freaking amazing!*

That being said, what does BigEast stands for?? I guess everyone can make their own conclusion by now... TVXQ! are Gods, the W in Cassiopeia stands for sovereign seal to symbolize that we are under their sky and reigns, BigEast stands for their empire and rules in the East because they are the Gods who rises from there just like a Rising Sun that rises from the East.... It also fits in the narrative that they are literally the **BIGGEST BOYBAND IN ASIA from 2000 - 2011, and still are to this date.** Their status and achievements as the **greatest foreign artist in Japan** (*the biggest music market in the EAST &amp; 2nd largest in the world*) are the prime evidences to that claim. Do you think all of these amazing names, fandoms, 4 syllables characters, symbolics, events, lawsuits/seperations, lyrics, songs, status, titles are coincidences??? Or is it a FATED decided by the DIVINE? *Stay tuned..... ~~in the next episode of DBZ~~ for the amazing ride with TVXQ! &amp; JYJ too in the future*

And I was further shocked about her controversy that arose that led to her and GLAM's disbandment. Not gonna lie, when I first heard her sing, I became a fan. I was still not a fan of kpop when they were still active so I don't know how big the controversy was and hearing her for the first time singing, I was blown away. 

Her instagram shows that she had plastic surgery for reasons i could only guess. I hope she's happy now and eventhough chances are slim, hopefully we get to see her showcase her vocal skills in the future.

Why don't you lose weight?"" ((https://youtu.be/f-IlCqVipBE?t=176)). I understand that maintaining a certain weight is important in South Korean society, but I was just dumbstruck that that was the first thing to come out of an adult's mouth in response to such amazing dancing, and that he even thought it was acceptable to say (especially given that she didn't even strike me as overweight when I was watching).

The highest ranked songs from last week were **Sunmi's Siren** with an overall score of **8.87** and **Red Velvet's Power Up** with an overall score of **8.85!** Congratulations to both Sunmi and Red Velvet! You can see the rest of the scores [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox/2019_reviews). 

So, who got the love shot this year? Well, we can definitely say Jennie and Kai did - solo, no more! What songs are on Jukebox this week? Lets find out! Here are this week's songs:

1. [MV] [Jennie - SOLO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b73BI9eUkjM)
2. [Chungha -  12 (Gotta Go)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlN2BXNJzxA)
3. [NCT U - Without You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6OcvS54KYQ)
4. [Eyedi - Caffeine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjs8rfejcU)
5. [Code Kunst - XI (feat. Lee Hi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFkmevW2eCI)
6. [SHINee - Alarm Clock ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp-07wevl64)
7. [INFINITE - Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1oTSAhdzNQ)

As always on Jukebox, seven songs are up for review, so you get to talk about them and leave any thoughts, be they praise or criticism, about the song! **Please remember to be respectful,** and while you're allowed to be harsh, remember to keep your criticism towards the song (i.e. this is NOT the place to call an artist lazy). Alongside your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10, with a score of 1 being the lowest (this song is Bad-da-da-da-da-da) and 10 being the highest (this song is an XI/X and you can't get enough of it). If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you consider the MV in your review - totally optional and up to you! Feel free to review one songs or all of them! If you are still a bit confused/unclear as what to do, you can always [refer to the very first Jukebox thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/). 

I will leave reviews for songs open all week until the upcoming Friday at 11:59 PM PST. Thats not a strict deadline - it just makes it easier for me to calculate scores to reveal in the following Jukebox thread + wiki.

I'm talking about [the ymmd-window](https://ymmd-window.com/) teasers they've released on twitter. The eerie feeling when the first one dropped without context just playing Getting closer on the tv in a dark room and different versions they've continued to release (click on the clock to cycle through versions) as time changes, playing Oh My! etc.

a lot of times we hear about a lot of controversial things that idols do but for some reason or another we stay. so if you stayed, what happened and why did you stay? if you didnt, what happened and what convinced you to unstan an idol you used to love?

&amp;#x200B;

to start off, i still listen to red velvet and wendy despite her racist comments making headlines twice. i honestly dont have a 'good' explanation for it. i chose to not to intepret her actions as malicious i guess, and chose not to associate her personal actions with red velvet (whose music i really like).

&amp;#x200B;

My take is that it's straight members of K-pop bands just being playful. But maybe it's also a little deeper than that. Do you think maybe it's gay-baiting? Every time a K-pop star goes in to kiss another one, the audience goes absolutely wild. It generates headlines, so maybe the stars consciously do it to drum up media attention? I'm not saying this is a clear-cut theory, but just wondering what other people think?

Just thinking about it on a purely business sense, boy bands make way more than girl groups.  According to the Gaon album charts, TWICE who is the top girl group, only came in at #10 in 2018.

http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=&amp;termGbn=year

Given that even if a girl group breaks out they still make less than boy groups, why do companies have female trainees?  Do female trainees get paid less than male ones?  It seems the probability for profitability and success would be much in favor for males.  Of course girl groups have a different flavor and artistry than boy groups, but we've seen in recent years companies only really care about profit.  Even if having a girl group diversifies the product offering, it would make more sense to allocate more resources to boy groups (like having 3 boy groups to every girl group) vs. the typical 50/50 split we currently have.",47,1

I don't. But seeing how big Kpop groups like BTS have gotten in the past few years, makes me wonder if Kpop is becoming more a of global phenomenon vs being primarily in Asia with dedicated fans spread out around the world.

Here are some numbers for album sales I found just to answer my question, they may not be completely accurate, and I know album sales in general are going down around the world. Except with Kpop. So I didn't look at things like how much groups like One Direction sold in their prime. But please post any examples that contradict my numbers! :)

BTS Love Yourself:Answer  2,197,808 

EXO Don't Mess up My Tempo  1,951,879 

Ariana Grande Dangerous Woman 900,000

Sam Smith The Thrill of it All  1,400,000

&amp;#x200B;

Blackpink DDU-DU DDU-DU 604M

Ariana Grande No Tears Left to Cry 708M

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure in terms of just general net worth Kpop groups still have some ways to catch up to. But I guess what I'm just getting at, is I'm impressed that Kpop has gotten so much bigger globally, and you have all these Western artists wanting to collaborate with groups like BTS and Blackpink. So what do you think is the global trajectory of Kpop? Do you see it just getting bigger and bigger?

1562,2019-01-15,2019,1,15,12,ag4c7e,[RANT] New to the community and ranting about the toxicity encountered so far,ScaryPantsu,1547524078,"Hey r/kpop,

So my friend makes Tik Tok videos. Most of them are anime related but sometimes she'll do different ones. On a trip to NYC, she decided to do a small little dance video to IU's BiBiBi. Upon uploading the video, she received comments like ""cringe"" or ""Koreaboo"" from accounts that had also uploaded kpop videos themselves or had their bias as their profile pic. 

After replying to them and going back and forth about how it's being a ""Koreaboo"" or not, my friend finally revealed that she was Asian. The person who initially called her ""koreaboo"" apologized and that was that.

Fast forward to now....

After looking up the top liked K-pop Tik Toks, she noticed that the videos where the creator didn't look Asian, were bombarded with hate comments:

""You don't even know the meaning of those lyrics""

""You're using BTS only because they're famous""

""Not even singing it right""

I know it's a speculation that the hate is based on the creators' looks but it really was only those Tik Toks that didn't have an Asian in the thumbnail that were hated on. My friend even laughed about how one of creators were Chinese and that how /they/ probably didn't even know what the meaning was. But they were praised for trying anyway.

I don't mean to start an argument or what but we both needed to vent somewhere. And we both are fairly new to the Kpop community itself. (We really only listen to the songs and dance a bit.)

Is most of the community like this? Or is it probably only a Tik Tok thing. Is this also looked down upon in /this/ Reddit community? We just don't get it.

1614,2019-01-15,2019,1,15,21,ag811w,Pls trend the hashtag #sueyoutube,zhihaohong52,1547555590,"A few groups MVs (including but not limited to BTS, Blackpink and TWICE) have been taken down from YouTube due to a false copyright claim from Aiplex Software Pte Ltd (based in India). 
Apparently this is not the first time this company has made fake copyright claims. 

YouTube has failed to recognise that the claims made by this company were fake and did not take action to stop their actions. Instead, they took down the videos. 

This isnt about what fandom you are from. We all love kpop here and we want to protect our idols. Every MV taken down means money that is supposed to go to their companies are lost and in turn they dont get paid. Together we are strong and can send a message that such actions cannot be tolerated. 

I urge all of u to trend the hashtag #sueyoutube on social media platforms like Twitter, IG etc. Remember to tag the companies so that they can see that the fandoms demand legal action. Only with legal action will YouTube realise their mistake and prevent it from happening again. Also, with legal action, the companies will get compensated for the false claims and in turn out idols get compensated too. 

Stop this malice now. 
Pls trend the hashtag, my fellow kpop lovers. Tqsm",1,1

These are just 2 big observations that I've  made during the last year and a half getting into K-Pop for the first time.  These are the things in my opinion that makes it more appealing and entertaining.

First off, they are AMAZING preformers and I'm not just talking about when they dance.
It's the little looks that they give, how they move between transitions and how they interact with the audience during the preformance.
There are a lot of mainstream artists that while are amazing singers are not great performers on stage (sure be good at what you're good at but you have to admit being able to do both is impressive).

Second and lastly, the content that K-Pop puts out is insane! 
I follow a couple western artists and I've been dissapointed with how little content as well as the variety of content that I can find available online that is not behind a pay wall. 
Whereas the K-pop artists I follow keep me regularly entertained with their Variety shows, V-Lives and content that their own company produces (B.T.S, react to MV, Vlogs etc)

What are your thoughts?",31,1

Songs that I have that are instrumental-

Day6 - Shoot Me

Red Velvet - Bad Boy, Russian Roulette &amp; Rookie

BTS - Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears

After listening to the instrumental, have you noticed anything about the instruments or composition?  For me, the songs are catchier in inst. especially Shoot Me, since the vocals were not my type, and I get into the beat of the song much quicker without the overpowering vocals.

1720,2019-01-16,2019,1,16,23,aglpuy,Who could be the unexpected daesang winners of this year?,bhishma-pitamah,1547649387,"I am not saying Ikon winning SOTY was unexpected but I doubt that most people actually expected Ikon to win a daesang anytime soon before the release of love scenario. Most people wouldn't have thought of Ikon winning back in 2017 but this just shows how fast things can change in kpop. Momoland was also pretty close to the daesang this year so can't really rule out nugu groups either.

So who do you think could be the unexpected winners of daesang this year?

I think seventeen has a decent chance of winning one, their fanbase is growing steadily and their japanese debut was highly successful and gave them great sales. Even if they don't win one this year, they could definitely win one in the future.

Red velvet-could get one if they release a red flavour like public friendly song again. (Or are they already thought of as a daesang winner because I have heard that they have won one in a non music related show? I am not sure how that works)

Blackpink- not that unexpected if going by their digitals, if they release a song properly and it has similar hype to dddd they can definitely get a SOTY.

Mamamoo- their releases get consistent digitals and their profile has increased in south korea especially after hwasa 's TV appearances so who knows they may finally get a SOTY this year. Finger crossed.

AKMU- Chanhyuk gets out this year and AKMU is well liked in korea so it's possible if they release new music this year.

But getting a SOTY could be really hard this year if IU releases new music.

Album daesang is kind of hard with groups like BTS, EXO etc around but does anyone think that wanna one pt.2 can have a even bigger monster rookie debut then wanna one ? Is that possible? Izone had more sales then IOI for their debut right? (I am not sure about this so feel free to correct me). BTS is kind of hitting big numbers at the moment so it would still be really hard even with a big monster rookie debut but the unexpected can always happen.

What do you guys think? Who could be the unexpected winner of a daesang this year?

&gt; Hello, this is OH_mes

&gt; As you may know, my account OH_mes was just suspended due to DMCA takedowns by KBS for multiple videos I had posted of special stages from KBS Gayo Daechukje in 2017 and 2018.

&gt; Given the timing of this, it seems like a good time to take an extended break from posting updates.

&gt; If (I don't expect it to happen) OH_mes ever happens to be un-suspended, I may go back to posting updates. But for now, I'm sure people will be able to get their updates from other sources.

&gt; While there were a lot of high points, and some low points, the past 2+ years of giving updates to everyone has been pretty fun, in the end.

This can be from a live show or not. Live performances where the singer embellishes a bit on otherwise ""normal"" notes from the studio recording will also count for this thread. 

Off the top of my head, I immediately think of the entirety of the ""Call Me Baby"" chorus. They mix everything together so well, and in their acoustic version it sounds even better. Sticking with EXO, Chen's adlibs over the ending chorus in ""Tempo"".

Jinho's high note at the beginning of the last chorus in ""Shine"" is also really good.",125,1

# Notes/Reminders:

* Cameras will be allowed for the concert but not the Meet and Greet.
* To purchase the Meet and Greet package you need to have purchased the Concert Ticket. 
* To get into the Meet and Greet they will check your email confirmation of purchase as well as your concert ticket.
* If there's anyone living in LA who feels that Indio is too far away, there will be transportation available for $10. Link: [https://kpopticket.us/product/10-transportation/](https://kpopticket.us/product/10-transportation/)
* For those hoping to purchase the merchandise items individually and not the package, you can now do so through the Kpopticket.us website. Link: [https://kpopticket.us/product-category/main/](https://kpopticket.us/product-category/main/) 

For anyone who wasn't aware that Oh My Girl was having a tour, please consider purchasing a ticket. The ticket sales haven't been going so well and JSJ Entertainment hasn't been doing that great of a job promoting them either. If possible I'd like for Oh My Girl not to have to perform to near empty venues. ",74,1

What text entry problems have you had? Do you convert everything into latin characters and avoid korean characters entirely? What programs choke on hangul?

I ask because I'm using GNU/Linux Debian 9 and noticed while sorting old files that some k-pop files appear as blocks. Encoding is unicode but this distro of Linux doesn't support hangul if english is the default language (I'm pretty sure it would work if I set korean to be default).

That got me thinking about Redditors like you all.

Anyway, my plan is to confirm that the filenames are still valid UTF-8 chars pointing to valid Hangul Unicode numbers and hope future iterations of my operating system software add more unicode character support. Also, I don't have *that* many kpop songs in my music library but it is annoying to see blocks in my file browser. :/",1,1

1842,2019-01-18,2019,1,18,3,ah0ipo,What are your favorite/least favorite alternate language versions of K-pop songs?,DaBlackBlur,1547748260,"With K-pop becoming more global and groups spreading their influence to different countries, releasing K-pop songs in different languages is a common practice for many groups. In all honesty, I find a lot of them to be hit or miss, mostly because the way languages sound don't always mesh well with the music, as the music is normally written with the lyrics' original language in mind.

Personally, [the English version of Sober by Hyoyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5-ovx56zjk) is probably my favorite English language adaptation of a K-pop song. I love how the lyrics tell a different yet cohesive and strong story compared to the Korean version. Her pronunciation is also really good! [The English version of Regular by NCT 127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj-VU9oK2Yo) and [WayV's Chinese version of Come Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caiJ3gmSG9s) are great as well. I don't really care for EXO's Chinese songs in general, but I absolutely love love love [the Chinese version of Hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvZEHHd1JTA).

On the other hand, [the English version of Cherry Bomb by NCT 127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lqiDnAuQM8) and [the Korean version of Chain by NCT 127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEFfqhbaibI) are really...not that good, to put it kindly. [The Japanese version of Lucifer by SHINee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEOKSpViv3s) isn't too terrible but still doesn't flow nearly as smoothly as the original. And while I do appreciate the attempt at making a Spanish version of a song, [the Spanish version of Lullaby by Got7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk08A8BhLLM) flows really poorly, doesn't have the best pronunciation, and members cut each other off all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking for a music discovery/streaming app for a while now. I've been trying to get Korean Spotify equivalents like Vibe and Melon, but a) I either couldn't get any of those apps while being in the US and b) I didn't want to pay however much a month for a subscription anyways. Pandora is alright for old mainstream K-pop, but I wanted to get music that fitted my tastes! I like old 90s ballads and calm, acoustic style music, and unfortunately this is not what most music streaming sources consider to be popular enough to include in ""K-pop."" I even tried listening to Korean radio through Kong KBS Radio, but I couldn't find a channel that suited me (and had little talking).

&amp;#x200B;

But today I rediscovered SoundCloud! I never used the site except to upload music for practicing dance routines, but I found that the ""station"" option chooses/finds great songs that completely suit the sound I've been looking for! There is so much variety on the site that it's not hard to find moderately obscure/aged music without running into a shitload of BTS!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the station I'm listening to right Now based on a song by the indie band Broccoli, you too? 

[https://soundcloud.com/stations/track/klgyo/rv6wmfxkzzm1](https://soundcloud.com/stations/track/klgyo/rv6wmfxkzzm1)

&amp;#x200B;

(The band was interestingly enough recommended to me by Listen On Repeat, which I use to handpick my study music since it's directly linked to YouTube.)

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Listen On Repeat. I love the site for listening to music and building playlists because I can loop songs endlessly until I get sick of them (while at the same time being satisfied by the repeat counter increasing). It's also synced to YouTube, so there's a huge variety of songs! It's not much good for discovering songs, though, since it doesn't have a recommendeds section like YouTube.

1894,2019-01-18,2019,1,18,17,ah8g78,Misleading Clickbait articles on my recent AMA,kpopAMAthrowaway,1547800258,"Hello, I recently conducted an AMA here on r/kpop that was overwhelmingly interactive. I'm still somewhat answering questions but I'm actively avoiding repetitive questions.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ag4qcl/i\_am\_a\_former\_sm\_trainee\_ask\_me\_anything/](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ag4qcl/i_am_a_former_sm_trainee_ask_me_anything/)

&amp;#x200B;

It's come to my attention that articles are twisting the context of my answers in the AMA. I was extremely careful in my wording so that I will not incite any hate or miscommunication. Now, this situation is not new (ehem kOrEABoo); however, because it's happening to me, I want to give my thoughts to clarify this.

&amp;#x200B;

They twisted my words. Yes, those were copy pasted from my AMA but they CLEARLY cherry-picked the negative things. \*If anyone could please contact this outlet and tell them to remove the article and issue an apology for sharing misleading news. I do not want to tolerate hate baiting content so I would like the article down.\* I do not want to contact them because I'm really pissed and I doubt they will take me seriously because I did this anonymously and I'm not a celebrity.  It was not the intent of AMA, I'm very upset and unfortunately, disappointed but not surprised. \*I want to denounce the article for deliberately changing the context of my words to make shocking headlines to get more clicks.\* It shows the low level of their due diligence considering they are just starting out, they should be more prudent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if there are other sites sharing misleading content about my AMA. 

&amp;#x200B;

Posting the article as a reference BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO CLICK IT because it will only generate ad profit for this misleading news outlet and they pretty much just copy pasted my answers from the AMA I linked above.

We're back baby, and BIGGER and BANGIER than ever before!!

If you don't know what this project is, get your head in the game. Check out our [Youtube channe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ)l, and our last release Merry &amp; Happy [here](https://streamable.com/wx95y) because JYP is an anti.

-----

We're sticking to a bunch of things that worked well over the last year, **specifically pre-selected themes and limited and pre-reviewed song options**. This is going to save me OODLES of time and make the whole process more fun. We did our best to select themes and songs we know the subreddit will enjoy **as a majority**. You'll still get to vote between specific options, but this will save us a huge amount of time and also a lot of potential discourse. Sorry if it seems a bit totalitarian, but I'd like to remind you that you're always more than welcome to cover whatever song you want by yourself. Literally nobody stopping you from doing that.

-----

Our first one is obviously The HYPE of Big Bang! [Bang Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw) and [Fantastic Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbokV76tkU) are obviously two of the most iconic and excellent songs ever released, so now I'm making you pick between the two of them :) There are *obviously* a bunch of other incredible and famous and beloved Big Bang songs, but these two are by far the most popular and iconic, so please don't complain thank you.



#Voting Will Close Next Thursday PM

Submissions will then open on the following Friday.

Inversely, do you think any members or groups as a whole did better in their debut concept than a past or the current era?",kween_of_Pettys,1547839934,"I know they have to do whatever is thrown at them if theyre in a label that doesnt have creative freedoms. I also know just because it doesnt suit them doesnt mean they cqnt pull it off.

##but 

for me its

* Jin - BTS 
 Any era than their debut. Bad boy/hardcore hiphop doesnt suit him as wellvas some others

* Jinyoung - GOT7
Even though he technically debuted with JJ project, i think other concepts fit him better

* f (x) really found their sound when they let out 4 walls imo. Never to be seen again lol

* 4minute ""Crazy"" era was scary

* B.A.P debuted strong and steadily declined in concepts imo. But then again thet did say they didnt like the image and concepts they had earlier on in their career, so i dont know what that fully means for them as a group

Etc. I wont list them all. ",70,1

3 rappers

1.  Choi Hyun Suk
2. Haruto
3. Ha Yoon Bin

Congrats to So Jung Hwan, hes talented but he wasnt on my list. After watching the dance performance (which was insane, loved the choreo) I was willing to bet money it would be seung hun or mashiho. I couldnt believe it when Jung hwan was picked. Such a wildcard tbh.

The obvious one to debut amongst the rappers was haruto since all of korea and YG have joined in on the circle jerk. Dont get me wrong hes got everything going for him, but his ego is obvious to me and its slightly a turn off.  

Ha Yoon Bin is my second favorite rapper just below Choi Hyun Suk. Every since the GO GO GO performance I instantly became a fan. His rap
Verse was so sick, and I see the potential. However. I dont know if he will debut. Hes got great tone, swag, flow, visuals, and hes trendy. Same thing with Hyun Suk. 

Im not 100% sure who they will announce, but I think for sure its gonna be Hyun Suk. The rest are up in the air. This last episode got me triggered... 

Seung hun, Mashiho, Yoon bin, Choi Hyun Suk, at least 3 of you please debut. ",136,1

I was lucky enough to see Oh My Girl last night, and I wanted to talk about it because I know there's been a lot of discussion this tour and I wanted to give some information for the folks in the future tour cities to figure out if they should go.

First of all, a word about the venue. Center Stage sits 1,000, and there was nowhere near 1,000 people there last night. I don't know exactly why JSJ Productions chose that site, but Center Stage is probably a known destination to promoters working with K-pop artists -- CL and [Epik High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alKKScYYhog) have played there; A.C.E. was there was last month (and I believe they near sold out the place). I agree with /u/wrath99 in the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ahfw3d/anyone_else_seeing_oh_my_girl_tonight_atlanta_118/) that they likely would have been able to sell more tickets if they'd chosen a venue further north-northeast -- most of our Korean and Korean-American population is in Duluth/Johns Creek/Suwanee, and getting from there to a Midtown venue for a 7 p.m. start time on a Friday night, given Atlanta traffic, is... a challenge. When the Dynamic Duo/Crush/Zion.T tour came through they played at Wild Bill's in Norcross (about a 30-minute drive northeast of Center Stage, not counting traffic) and that was a much better fit with a *much* larger Asian-American audience. (Monsta X played Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, in the northwest; I assume they sold out but I don't know.) So in general I'd like to see the Gwinnett venues become more competitive for Korean visiting acts. I don't know exactly how fans would go about encouraging that -- reaching out to various local chambers of commerce, would be my first guess. 

The upshot was that I was able to buy the cheapest ticket available (still $69 -- nope, they didn't lower prices at any point) and walk in five minutes before the show started. I will say that Center Stage is a pretty good place to watch a show from. I was second row from the back and I was still very happy with my view.

On to the show! First of all, it is *short*. JSJ had at least warned everyone by posting the schedule that the music would be 7-8:30 pm with the M&amp;G following, but it was more like 7:05-8:20. I didn't get an M&amp;G ticket so I can't speak to that experience, but if you're opposed on principle to paying $70 for an hour's worth of music, this is not the concert for you. (And I don't blame you.) To be fair, there were no costume changes or subunit/solo stages, and only a couple breaks for OMG, once to do a fan Q&amp;A and once while a short video played with clips from all their singles. So it was a relatively efficient concert as K-pop concerts go. But still: short.

OMG themselves: fantastic! We all know they have some fairly demanding choreo but I was still impressed when they came out and immediately performed Cupid and Windy Day back-to-back. A couple times I would notice a member grimace as if she'd just missed a step but I never saw the mistake itself. I suspect we weren't hearing their live singing voices, with the possible exception of Seunghee (and Mimi yelling ""Make some noise!"" a few times), but to me it didn't really matter. They got in all the singles except A-ing and Banana Allergy Monkey, plus Butterfly, one other slower song I don't remember as well (this was the designated wave-at-fans-and-use-their-phones-to-take-selfies song), Twilight, and Our Story. Yes, that's right: TWILIGHT LIVE, Y'ALL.

Mimi was hype man. Seunghee was the most outgoing and the most comfortable in English, though honestly it was sweet that they had all learned enough English to at least introduce themselves to the crowd. Jiho made the mistake of, when she was asked about her favorite fish [at the Georgia Aquarium](https://twitter.com/8_OHMYGIRL/status/1086166406360485888), saying ""shark"", and so the crowd chanted ""Baby Shark"" at her until she did a minute or so of the dance. (And then the members were surprised we knew ""Baby Shark."" Y'all, my kids were singing ""Baby Shark"" at their preschool long before any idols touched it!) I thought Arin and Binnie were the most visibly nervous. But honestly, don't pay too much attention to my judgments: Mimi and Seunghee are my main biases in OMG and Mimi was on my side of the stage much of the time so that's where my attention was. 

I'll tell y'all this: the only other pure K-pop concert I've been to was Infinite in New York in November 2013. And if you've heard about that concert, you might have heard that there was a great deal of pushing and shoving and people fainting or nearly getting stomped on, to the point that [Dongwoo had to reassure/warn the crowd](https://youtu.be/W9GUoiHe5JY?t=111). I remember thinking at the time that the guys seemed visibly upset on stage, but going to see OMG made me reflect on that experience still further, because the vibe last night was so very different. It was just much, much happier and less desperate. People did come up to the edge of the stage during ""Our Story"" to give their phones, but I never got the impression that any of OMG felt overwhelmed or threatened. It was a small crowd, but the Miracles who were there did a good job. (Except on fanchants. We totally fell down on fanchants, and I never thought I'd be the kind of person who'd say, ""We totally fell down on fanchants,"" but yeah, Chicago et al., please make up for our mistakes while we here in Atlanta are reflecting.)

During the ending ment Binnie confessed that she was worried they wouldn't get much of an international reception, but they all made a point of thanking us for our warm welcome. I don't know how sincere that was -- whether they'd been so worried that *no one* would show up that they were relieved to see a half-full house, or the lighting and the crowding of the fans up front was such that they couldn't see the empty seats in the back, or they came off stage and went ""WTF, there was nobody there!"" Either way I have to hand it to them for being willing to do that emotional labor for us, making us feel like we'd started their tour off right.

So I personally am very glad I went. I would recommend it -- but only if you're in a financial position that you won't mind the short show and/or you're willing to splash out for the M&amp;G. If Oh My Girl isn't one of your favorites, I wouldn't necessarily spend the money just because it's a K-pop show. I've liked Oh My Girl [since debut](http://www.thesinglesjukebox.com/?p=21595), and this experience only made me love them more. (Twilight live!)",45,1

I know I have talent and my dream is to become a performer. I would prefer to be a singer in the US because my native language is english and the western music industry is much more progressive, but I feel that since the kpop industry is so systematic, it's easier to be noticed. Outside of korea, you have to be ""discovered"" somehow by some label company, such as through a viral video, connections or something, and they reach out to you, but in South Korea, there is a set system of auditioning, training, and then hopefully debuting. You go to them, and they can notice you if you stand out at the audition. I'm conflicted about auditioning and going to Korea because I know there are so many hardships and injustices for idols, but it would be more efficient to go into a big kpop company and debut, with some amount of guaranteed success and recognition. Anyone relate? words of wisdom?

I have no one to express how happy I am, I dont join/follow any fan account so sometimes it feels so lonely without anyone to talk about this. I only like BTS for their songs, I dont watch their variety appearance because of my tendency to go overboard and obsessive. 

I went to their world tour in Singapore today solely for their songs and even though I only had enough money for the cheapest seat, it was one of the best things that have happened to me. 

Everything feels pre-BTS and post-BTS. It was so surreal, I was walking around after concert feeling high on happiness, literally in euphoria even though I was alone and got lost after the event. 

 I couldnt believe that I was breathing the same air with them, standing under the same roof with them. I just cant. Im so happy I feel like screaming to the sky because Im sharing the same sky with them for one more night. 

I dont know if Im ever gonna be lucky to buy front seat ticket for their concert or if I can do this again, but I just want them to know (or at least I pretend my feelings can reach them) that today they have made so many people happy, including me, who have not been happy for a very long while now.

OMG FAN ACCOUNT

So I bought tickets to the OMG concert in ATL the day before the show. I bought the $68 (88 with fees), so basically the cheapest ones because I wasnt really a fan of Oh My Girl and didnt know them all too well but I was willing to fill a seat and show them some love.

So the day before the concert, I learned the rest of their names (I already knew Mimi, Seunghee and YooA) And by their concert I was ready to show them all love.

So I went with a couple new friends and we went to the Atlanta Kpop store on the way there.. We all bought OMG lightsticks (and I kind of bought 5 fromis\_9 albums and a tsb twice album oops). Then we went to lunch and met up with people from discord! It was a fun time, the meet up gathererererer (thanks father) gave us pins and photo cards of the girls!

Then after lunch we walked to the concert venue (we parked earlier and walked to lunch. The parking was like under the venue which was weird but whatever). And then I went to the merch table because two of my friends were hanging out there. We were just waiting for entrance into the concert.

Then by the time I was let in, they directed me to my high ass seats and I met two strangers and we were talking about moving down seats. So we kept checking the ticketing site to see what was open. We moved to closer seats and by the first song, I saw people were on the left side of the stage just standing. So I ran up there as well and started cheering.

There were so many fan interactions. Just knowing their names was the cutest thing seeing their face light up when they see you. Since I know a bit of Korean and the translator and them were struggling to communicate, I helped them translate a bit! Thats how Arin and Seunghee noticed me a lot because they were standing on the left side where I was at.

So I had many many interactions with all the members except Hyojung. I think she posed a couple times for me though hahaha. So Yooa touched my hand and she also grabbed at my arms then she held my hand at a later time. Jiho always came over to pose and she blew a kiss into my camera. Binnie rarely came over as well but when she did, she posed into my camera like a cutie! 

So for the concert, there was a 13 minute q&amp;a portion and I feel like I should explain myself for this. So at the beginning of the concert there was an area where you could write questions on index cards for them to answer. So I went to the table and was writing my question in Korean so I didnt know what to ask them. So I asked the volunteer who was working there what to ask them and he said to ask if they were hungry.. So I did, not expecting them to answer it. But guess what, Mimi drew my index card and she answered it. She said she was hungry hahaha and I had also just asked for some simple cute stuff like a chuu heart and I wanted to see some aegyo. The translator thought it said shoot a heart, so mimi shot a heart but Im still in love. Then mimi saw the aegyo part and was like why why why but then she kept reading and said that it said I love you \~liz so she did the aegyo while saying I love you liz and Im like FCUUKCKCK. But all during this I was telling Arin and Seunghee that I wrote it and they were like omg you did?? And trying get to Mimi to look my way and ended up failing. There was another question that was quite memorable what was the hardest time during your training and Arin had got this question. Arin said it was staying up really late and practicing choreography. Then seunghee brings up they practiced from like 9 pm to 7 am, and the mood got really sad. So they brought the mood back up by gifting out polaroids to M&amp;G participants\~ (Thank you Kev for videoing this and sending it to me! [https://twitter.com/kekekekekev/status/1086716260405121024](https://twitter.com/kekekekekev/status/1086716260405121024))

But Arin and Seunghee noticed me the most because I would help translate stuff for them! Arin kept coming to me because shes so cute and I ended up telling her we were friends, so should took my phone and did a video Selca of us! And Seunghee grabbed my phone earlier in the concert and kept coming over to pose, shes so cute as well. 

But the concert ends (we know it didnt bc theres encore on the end of the set list but we did the usual encore shouting!) so they come back out. 

Mimi comes over and Im like Im liz! And shes like really? And then proceeds to take a video on my phone like the badass she is. 

Then I ended up buying M&amp;G because I truly just fell for all of them while they were performing. I hi-touched them and thanked them for the performance in Korean. Then Binnie runs over to see the baby and Arin has to sign a few more posters. So after Arin signs a few more posters in front of us, she goes to Binnie and they play with a baby together.

Then she told me she loved me, it was the sweetest thing ever. 

So now I stan OMG. This was an amazing concert experience and my first ever. I cant believe I didnt stan this group before. (I also apologize that this fan account is all over the place, I wrote this as I was reorganizing my videos and then I took a midday nap for like 6 hours).

As of right now Im rewatching all my concert video and is currently deceased. **I recommend you going to the concert if youre in the area. Its a very personal concert and is so amazing to see them perform even if you dont stan!** If anybody has any questions or anything feel free to drop them in the comments section!

As of right now, I only have video for Remember Me and Coloring Book (WITH A RAP!!) up on my youtube (because honestly I'm quite tired, lazy, and going through some serious PCD right now) but please enjoy!

Hello! Ive seen about two fan accounts of the Oh My Girl in Atlanta show, and I just thought itd be really cool to share mine as well, especially since I was a staff volunteer, and I know many people have questions pertaining to my job.

When I first saw Oh My Girl was coming to Atlanta a couple months ago, I was really excited. Id been waiting for a girl group to be coming to Atlanta for the longest time, and I considered myself to be a soft stan for OMG; I absolutely loved their debut and concept, and I casually kept up with most of their comebacks. I got especially excited because I saw that they were coming to Center Stage, a small venue in the heart of Atlantas midtown. Im a big concert-goer whod seen multiple acts here including BTS and Shawn Mendes when their fame was less prominent. Center Stage specifically is known to have cheap concert tickets, hardly ever exceeding $50 per ticket, so when I saw that Oh My Girls cheapest one started at $65, I was shocked. It was such a big turn-off because although I had really hoped to see them, I knew tickets at Center Stage shouldnt have been marked that ridiculously expensive. Especially since Im a university student whose bank account had just been hit by the holiday season and tuition payment, I literally could not afford to go see them.

Despite the missed opportunity to buy a ticket though, I consistently checked on JSJ Entertainments facebook page partly because I still wanted to be updated on their show and partly because I had hoped they would host ticket giveaways. I think they did have giveaways, but they were social media-based and I really dont like participating in those, so I didnt enter. Anyways, fast forward to the week of the concert, and I saw JSJ post staff volunteer applications. I was so quick to tag my friend, who also loved but couldnt afford OMG tix, in the post, and we submitted our apps together. The application (which was on a Google Doc I lowkey found ratchet) was really simple, actually. It simply required that you were 18+ years of age and asked you for your name, phone, email, and concert experience. Originally, I read the application wrong and I listed all of my previous work experience, but I was like oh well lol because by then I had already submitted the app. So yeah, I applied the day apps opened (Jan 12), and then I heard back through email on Jan 16. In the email, they asked that if I was still interested, I needed to text them back at the number they gave me. After I had done so, one of the staff members put all of us volunteers in a group chat and texted us to meet at the venue by 3pm.

My friend (who also got the volunteer position) and I ended up carpooling to the venue at 3pm, and the rest of the volunteers (6 of us in total) and staff were already there just hanging around. The staff head who originally texted us and was in charge of volunteers gave out our badges and explained to us that while three of them were going to be line-managing and checking the Meet &amp; Greet ticket-holders, the other three of us were going to be selling the merchandise. Since we had about 2 hours before we let doors open, they fed us pizza, and we were able to watch Oh My Girl do their soundcheck rehearsal! Honestly, it was so cool just having the opportunity to see idols rehearse in their casual clothes, and what really made me happy was that they treated each other and the sound staff really nicely, especially since I know theres a lot of talk about many idol groups being rude to staff behind the publics eyes. 

5pm rolls around, and we inevitably have people coming to the merch table to buy fan goods. I really cant believe how much money they made off of that night. I know fan merchandise from any artist on tour is expensive, but for the quality of the goods (no offense, a lot of the merch I felt like was honestly just aesthetically ugly), they were marked at ridiculous prices. A sweatshirt was $55- understandable. But for the same price, a baseball cap? My wallet could never. Not to mention we sold a bunch of fangood packages that night that sold for $130 each! What really caught me off guard though were the Meet &amp; Greet passes. In all of my concert-going experience, I had never heard of an event company selling the M&amp;G passes separate from the actual concert ticket. The M&amp;G passes ALONE sold for $200! That didnt even include the actual concert tickets that ranged from $65 to $120. Looking back, I suppose thats not \*too\* bad if you look at the price altogether, but it indeed was a strange concept to me.

It was pretty fun and not bad at all handling the merch line since I got to interact with a lot of people. So many Miracles of all ages travelled far to see OMG, and it really warmed my heart to see their music affect people of all different backgrounds. Some girls were even handing out cute banners, finger lights &amp; pins to everybody! They mustve put in so much work for that, so Im really thankful to have received them as well. 

Once the concert began, we closed down the merch table, and our staff head allowed us to go into the venue and sit in whatever free spot we could find to enjoy the concert. The six of us volunteers were really excited as we got to sit in the fourth row of floor seats, pretty close to the stage! The only way to describe that concert was magical. The girls performed all of their hit songs and never failed to give it their all in the choreography. I was always a big Mimi and Seunghee stan, and they did not disappoint when I saw that the two of them had huge stage presence. To be honest, I was really surprised when I found out that all of the members had a large stage presence, but the member that really caught my eye was Hyojung! In every song, my attention kept on being dragged back to her, and shes just an amazing performer. Im not really going to go into a major rundown of what happened during the concert just because I know the other two fan accounts for OMG ATL have already done so.

After the concert, Meet &amp; Greet time rolled around, so us volunteers rushed back to help out with line management and coat/bag-holding duty LOL Im just still in such shock because we all got to stand along with the rest of the official staff like less than 10 feet away from Oh My Girl who smiled at us often and treated us really well. I think they were surprised as well since we were all around the same age as them. So I saw that some people were complaining or expressing fear that JSJ was rushing the Meet &amp; Greets, and I just wanted to share my perspective from a regular fan and someone who was witnessing the whole thing. I personally feel like JSJ was really nice towards people who got their hi-touch and photos. They didnt rush anybody and allowed fans to exchange words and interactions with them. Compared to the event company that hosted BTS in 2014 and left 200 fans out in the pouring rain (me included) because they oversold capacity and compared to the event company that did BAPs Live On Earth tours and made people do hi-touch in a running line without anytime to properly greet members, I was very surprised and touched at how JSJ was very patient and actually allowed Miracles to talk to the girls. They were also very lenient on photo ops. For example, I know this one middle-aged man (who was the real Miracle) dressed up his 3-ish year old daughter as a banana monkey allergy. He only bought one M&amp;G pass for her, and when the OMG girls saw it was her turn for the photo, they absolutely lost it! I think they spent around 5 minutes just playing around with her before actually taking the photo. I dont blame them though, the little girl was adorable! But after she took a photo with them, the dad asked if he could take a family photo with his daughter, and JSJ easily allowed him too. Very smooth on his part considering he used his daughters cuteness to grab their attention, meet and take a photo with them for the price of one M&amp;G LOL. It was also very cute because even after M&amp;G sessions were over and most of the girls left, two members stayed just to play with the little girl for a little longer :,)

People were disappointed in the turnout of the concert. Truthfully, I was too. Although Oh My Girl doesnt have the biggest fanbase in the United States (God knows especially Atlanta), their ticket sales were an injustice, and I know for a fact they couldve sold a lot more if it were just advertised better. However, even though there wasnt as many people as Miracles had hoped to come out to the concert, there was still a really good amount of fans who came out, and the small audience paired with the queens of fanservice really made the concert feel special and intimate. Although it wasnt the biggest crowd that night, Oh My Girl was touched that they even had this many fans attend \[my heart :,(\], and you couldnt even feel the gaps within the venue when everybody just got up to the front pit anyways and was just having a good time with the girls. 

My friend who posted one of the OMG in ATL fan accounts said that some people were saying that JSJ didnt handle the M&amp;Gs well, but I personally felt like that was they were the most patient kpop event company Ive seen do their hi-touch and photos. I know there was this one group of boys who didnt buy M&amp;G passes, but stood in line to see them anyways, so they got kicked out for obvious reasons. Also, there were some people who spent time after photos to hug and talk to the members, and JSJ did eventually but politely have to tell them to move on. It was understandable in my opinion though. There were tons of other people in line, and its not like they had paid to have a whole dinner conversation with them. At some point, staff had to tell them to move on; they just did their job, but they were very patient and professional about it.

Honestly, I thought I would hate working with JSJ because I had heard so many horror stories of kpop event staff being extremely rude, and since Im really big on customer service, I thought it was going to be tough and Id just have to suck it up. To my surprise, however, staff treated us extremely well. They ordered us pizza and let us watch the soundcheck rehearsal &amp; show. At the end of the night, they also thanked us by gifting us a bunch of OMG merchandise, and we even got to meet and take a group photo with Oh My Girl as well! It was especially awesome hearing the girls thank us and telling us that we worked hard; they are literally the sweetest fairies ever :,) But yes for real, JSJ was indeed not a pain to work with, and I felt as if they treated other Miracles very fairly as well.

JSJ Entertainment is a fairly new concert-managing company; their first gig was BAP's Forever Tour, I believe. Working with them yesterday, I could definitely tell they fell behind in terms of logistics. To be honest, Center Stage is a popular venue to cater to smaller kpop acts, so I thought it was a suitable size. The major problem found within the ticket sales, however, is greatly attributed to the fact that JSJ is simply a small and new company that doesn't have the biggest budget or skills to market their tours correctly. Their social media presence is almost little to nothing, and where they are present, they are very last minute and unclear. I want to believe that it's because the staff is very Korean and not Americanized, so basing their company up in the US where English isn't their best language or form of communication is a huge disadvantage to them. Additionally, its just the problem of that theyre new and that nobody knows about them at all. However, working with them personally (I even met their CEO hello?? LOL), they are definitely one of the better event companies who arent rude pain in the asses, and I really hope that they learn from this tour to improve and grow their company into a better one in the future :)",25,1

Thats all for now! How many times will you say HEY to Jimin? Do you like ATEEZ's new song? How about Monsta X and KNK? Think Heize's song is love at first sight (or I guess listen) or not as enamored? Are the pretty girls AOA? Did Brave Sound really drop it? Find out and listen to this week's songs!

But when I was growing up I didnt remember such a huge emphasis on Youtube achievements. I think when Gee first came out I remember being impressed with how many views they got. When I got into Kpop again in 2017 I was amazed that views have gone into the stratosphere with groups like BTS,Blackpink,Twice. When did this happen? Is it just more people got into Kpop or did fans just start to make a concerted effort to buff up YouTube views?",8,1

I was at the Winner show in San Francisco on Friday and I thought I would share my experience.

I surprised my friend and splurged on getting VIP tickets for the night since it was her birthday the day after. I got an e-mail from Livenation a few days before with instructions on the whole process and we were told we weren't going to be allowed to line up at the venue until 2 PM so we decided to wander over there at about 2:45. And I have to say, Livenation had their shit together. But because of the venue's rules we weren't allowed to line up outside so we were directed to this large I don't want to say holding room, but I don't know how else to call it. So they checked my e-mail and directed us to a line where we took our spot and just chilled and waited for check in to start (which was around 4). I've been to one concert before in Korea and the way they had us line up reminded me of that. There were 8 lines total, each of them separated by metal barricades. And after about an hour of waiting someone from livenation checked us in and gave us numbered wrist bands (we ended up being 203 and 204). I want to say there were about maybe 250 or 300 VIP tickets? 

While we were waiting so many inner circles and fansites came around and [passed out goods](https://imgur.com/AOvdxX5). I ended up with paper slogans, a fan, a bunch of stickers, a blue finger light and unofficial photo cards (i apparently lost the stickers) and someone was handing out cute little rings with blue flowers on it. There were a few other paper banners and such but they ran out before they got to my place in line. But everyone around us was really nice and it was really chill. No one was pushing or shoving even during the concert and it was just a really nice experience. 

At about 6:15 and like 4 different lines later we finally got to go inside for soundcheck. They did every day, really really and love me love me. They were all dressed super casual and just kind of wandered around the stage the whole time. But they each made sure to cover the entire stage and spent a lot of time. Jinwoo was super shy but also the cutest at the same time. He was smiling and throwing hearts, but really coyly? I don't know how else to explain it but he always kept his hands really close to his chest. And throughout the main concert he was the king of fan service and was just a total angel. Seunghoon was doing body rolls all over the place so I had to mentally prepare myself for the actual show. Mino.....a total babe. You can't help but be drawn to him. He's got an amazing energy even if he's just standing there. 

The floor of the venue was split level, so the there was the main floor and 3/4 levels that were a bit higher than the one before. So we decided instead of dealing with everyone trying to get to the front, we went to the railing of the first elevated level and it was perfect. I didn't have to worry about not being able to see and I had a clear view of the stage and the boys. And It was perfect. My phone's storage decided to fill up halfway through the show but I just have one video I uploaded on twitter ([really really](https://twitter.com/_honeyyoon/status/1086513185463533568)) and I'm slowly getting other vids from my friend.

Winner are amazing perfomers. I honestly couldn't believe how good they were live. I've been to a few kpop concerts and for me, they had some of the best live vocals.  The stage was pretty narrow but they made the most of it. Their solo stages were great. Hoony covered Taeyang (that boy moves like water). Mino did Trigger and Fiance. Seungyoon brought out his guitar and covered Ariana Grande. Jinwoo covered untitled by g-dragon and i wish he did another song because the rest of the members had two, but he only did his one solo which was freaking great and he was wearing a pink suit and looked amazing. 

Seungyoon...I could go on and on about him to be honest. He's my bias and last night just made me fall in love with him even more. I didn't know he was that fluent in English, and he spoke english pretty much the whole time except for talking to his members.  He's definitely improved leaps and bounds since winner over flowers. And you could just tell how much he appreciated the crowd and being there. He got a bit choked up while reading [the banner](https://imgur.com/yF7ndLn) for [the night](https://imgur.com/YkuarAb) and talking about one of his childhood friends who was from San Francisco. His vocals were amazing and I was just.. in love. 

But anyway, I don't want to gush for too long because I could go on an over. But overall, it was an amazing experience and I had a smile on my face the whole time.  I would 100% recommend going to one of their remaining shows if you can because they really do put on a great show. ",32,1

https://i.redd.it/1ms9n046cpb21.png

I attended Oh My Girl's concert in Chicago today and I have to say it was a blast. I got there at about 5:15PM to get a good spot and because I thought the doors would open a bit earlier than they did. Doors opened at a little after 6:00PM so standing outside in the Chicago cold for 45 minutes definitely wasn't the highlight of my night, but it could've been worse. We finally got in and I headed straight for a seat. I paid for a 2nd tier ticket so I was able to get a decent seat and still have a good view. I also think it's worthy to mention that the attendance was much better than Atlanta's. It was always going to be a better turnout because Chicago's population is like double that of Atlanta's and therefore more kpop fans to see them. I wouldn't say they reached capacity (1K) but they certainly had a great turnout and the energy was insane. 

As for the concert itself, it started almost promptly at 7:00PM. The first song they performed was Cupid followed by Windy Day. Despite 2 high energy songs back to back they still kept up like it was nothing. They then introduced themselves with Seunghee and Mimi as the main English speakers. Seunghee especially speaks English confidently and she was the easiest to understand. All of the members attempted English a least a bit throughout though mainly Seunghee, Mimi &amp; Binnie. After introductions, they performed Butterly and I Found Love. Neither of the songs had choreography so it was just standing, swaying, and fanservice. Oh My Girl are honestly the queens of fanservice. They take phones and snap photos like it's nothing. There's lots of attention to all of the audience (though the most attention went to the front). At one point, Seunghee waved and pointed at me (or at least in my general direction but let me have this moment) and I lost my shit. Lots of cuteness all around and interactions galore. After IFL and Butterfly, they had a Q&amp;A session where they answered fan questions. The highlight of that portion was Hyojung's aegyo and Binnie's sexy aegyo as well as Mimi and Jiho dancing to Chained Up by VIXX. The original question was asking if they could perform a boy group song and after like 5 minutes of deliberation they chose Chained Up. The members and crowd sang along so it was fun.

After the Q&amp;A session, they performed Liar Liar and Coloring Book. Then there was a VCR video that was a compilation of their music videos and then they performed Twilight and Remember Me. There was another talking intermission where they gave their farewells. The highlight of that part was when some random person shouted ""Happy Birthday Seunghee!"" and she said ""How did you know?"" and then the whole audience sang her happy birthday. Seunghee said that would be a moment she never forgot. After the last intermission, they performed Closer and Secret garden which is when everyone put up their banners. For the encore, they performed B612.

Overall I enjoyed the experience. I've only ever been a casual stan of Oh My Girl since their debut. I stream their music but have never done much more than that. This concert turned me into a stan and I wish I had the money to attend the M&amp;G (which was way overpriced btw). Mimi was hype and friendly the whole time. Arin was a bit shy and quiet but that might have more to do with the language barrier than her personality. Jiho and Hyojung are ethereal in real life and they're so friendly. Binnie was the fan favorite of the crowd along with Mimi. Binnie was really fun to watch and she was super hype too. Yooa is the queen of facial expressions, body language, and fanservice. She gave 200% in every performance and she wasn't my bias until today. Seunghee was really interactive with the crowd and gave the most fanservice out of everyone. I'll never forget when someone shouted ""VOCAL LEGEND"" at Seunghee and the members struggled for like 5 minutes to figure out what the hell that person was talking about.

I'm glad the Chicago show was a huge turnaround from the first one and that the girls were able to see the demand they have here. Let's hope for a longer concert that's better promoted in the future.",20,1

If so, how have things ended up?",Unhopeful121,1548056638,"I was interested in this topic because I always see posts condemning stan Twitter, and saesangs (and sometimes rightfully so). But Ive  never seen anyone on this sub discuss whether or not theyve been a toxic fan. Id like for this to be a no shame discussion on whether or not youve struggled with obsession over a group or idol? 


I guess I should start and talk about my obsession over BTS. I grew up in a bit of an abusive family situation and kpop became my relief in darkness. After crying from hearing hours of screaming matches between my parents, watching a kpop mv or a variety show my troubles would just melt away. At first I was a diehard fan of Big Bang, and actually really disliked BTS. But then I stumbled across Suga and his song The last. I loved this song and it lead me to the rest of BTS. I was in love, and this Love became a disgusting obsession. I felt sick every time I saw videos of them, I wanted to meet them and know them. I felt like I knew them better than other fans. BTS was a way for me to forget who I was, my parental situation, my uncertainty about my future, my social anxiety and body issues. And so instead of focusing on fixing myself I put all of my attention on this group. 


Im still recovering from these thoughts. I want to become better and drop this sickness. So Im trying and really going to become healthier and better. Im not obsessed anymore, but I have bouts where I feel like nothing has changed. ",49,1

#####***Phase 1*** **Preparation**

-	VIP were sent email that VIP people are suppose to be in the place designated 45 minutes before 7:00 which is 6:15 pm.

-	Struggled in travelling since I dont use a car so I had to take a subway + bus + uber for like about more than 2 hours

-	Got into the venue at 5:20-ish and it was freezing cold since its Canada. So we were waiting outside in -27 degrees for about solid 2 hours. It was in a tent and there was heater but it was not enough since I was placed at the opposite side.

-	The staff outside were pretty much hostile in handling the lineup but some were really nice. What I hate is when they started scanning the tickets, people kept pushing non-stop and that was so irritating and immature to experience that kind of stuff again. There is like no way for people to become civil at that moment. 

-	I honestly didnt know coat check is not mandatory because I met people outside who were saying that you dont need to. (LPT right there)

#####**Phase 2** **Meet and Greet**

-	They scanned our tickets and we were separated to 10 individuals in one group and wore wristbands. The process was pretty much quick and less than 5 minutes

-	My soul is never prepared for this bc Idk what to do or say but idk if its his charisma, I was drawn to sit beside Simon Dominic. I shook his hands and i felt like I was on nirvana or some spiritual level.

-	Idk if i was too direct but I said I love him and I love his song and Im his biggest fan and you should keep doing more songs.

-	He said thank you and smiled and in that moment, Im deceased. Not to mention, we were actually given tour posters before the meet and greet happened.

#####**Phase 3** **Concert**

-	Did coat check for my poster and jacket and did immediately run through the centre to get a good spot. Tbh, this venue was really big and I didnt anticipate it to be. There was almost roughly 200+ vip and thats like amazing tbh. At same time, again people kept pushing and there is literally zero space given. 

-	The actual concert started at 8:30 and everyone was so hectic in figuring out when theyre going to play. The intro was done by DJ Wegun and the soundscape or the bass in venue is pretty much amazing since its a club

-	Woo Won Jae started with [Cash](https://youtu.be/ixXb56Vw1bE) first and the visuals and audio were stunning. Its my first time in a venue this big with screens lol.

-	His rapping was pretty much on point. Theres just something about his deep voice that gets you going. TBH, I didnt know him that much other than the fact that he joined SMTM but its really good.

-	Second performance was done by LOCO and im telling you, this guys charisma is on the roof. I honestly didnt expect him to be that charismatic since he looked so innocent in variety shows but damn. His flow in rapping is still cute and he tries to do this cute gestures too which is funny.

-	There was actually an intermission where all artists speak English and it was so nice to see them trying for our sake. Also, Loco kept joking and saying how he likes KEG steakhouse. Everything he does ends up being funny.

-	Then when everyone heard the gray whisper, literally everyone lose their shit. He kept teasing us with that legendary and iconic gray whisper and it was an eargasm tbh.


-	His visuals and rapping were really dreamy, he did some collab songs with loco and putting them together in stage is something that cannot be described purely. Everything was just amazing.

-	Simon D pretty much came late which is like at 10pm. Then this guy, looking at him irl compared to videos is something that I didnt know would ever happen in my life.

-	During the intermission, he was thanking us (cute) for coming to Toronto tour and he said he didnt know if it will happen soon because Loco had to go to army but he was thankful for coming at their first Canadian Tour.

-	Not only he is a man full of visuals but this guy was hilarious af. He had jetlag and pretty much make fun of himself for being 26-27 years old and how his body hurts. He tries to say most stuff in english too

-	Despite that tbh, he did well on his performance and rapping. He did about 3-4 songs and lastly, in the end they all collab together and play some legendary Jay Park Songs.

-	Anyways my phone dropped in the end when they used the confetti for their last song and I was scared for life that my phone wont survive in the mosh pit but luckily it did.

-	idk if its hoe-ish of me but I was hoping for water to be thrown like at least 5-10 water bottles bc that was like the minimum for all concerts I went to. 

-	It was still amazing tho that I got to experience that pure alkaline AOMG water.

Every year albums have seemed to increase. For example, BTS went from 1.8 mill for Love yourself:tear to 2.1 mill for love yourself answer( just Korea alone). Twice has been averaging over 300K per comeback with their peak at 427K for Twicecoaster: Lane 1 (Im guessing because of the TT phenomenon). But then theyve been blowing up in Japan and adding a ton of album sales. 

Do you think with Wanna One disbanding and Exo scaling back their group promos for solo activities that physical album sales will start to taper off? Or do you think with new groups from the Big 3 coming up and Big Hits new boy group that there will continue to be an effort to one up each other in terms of album sales?",16,1

\- RM, his voice feels very classy and makes him sound more intelligent? even though that doesn't make much sense

\- IU, not sure if she really counts as an idol but her voice is really sweet and smooth even when she's not singing

&amp;#x200B;

Each member of TVXQ! was supposed to debut as solo singers or lead 5 different groups. However, due to financial problems, SM Entertainment chose the most talented trainees and formed TVXQ! as an acapella-dance group. Lee Soo Man stated that out of several different teams, he chose the best member from each and brought them together to create a major-league team. That team was TVXQ!. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Saved The Industry**

&amp;#x200B;

In the early 2000s, people had lost their interest in idol groups so the K-Pop industry started dying out due to financial problems. As TVXQ! debuted on December 26, 2003, with 'Hug', they immediately attracted everyone's attention. Back then digital music sales weren't relevant and selling 100 thousand cassette albums, which were cheap, were considered a huge success. In 2004, TVXQ!'s debut album 'Tri-angle' and single albums 'Hug' and 'The Way You Are' sold more than 800 thousand CD albums. They gained huge popularity in Asia when they came back in 2008 with Mirotic and paved the way for K-Pop in Asia. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3. No Solo Works**

&amp;#x200B;

Although they were supposed to debut as solo artistsin the beginning, SM Entertainment in 2008 stated, ""TVXQ! will not be doing any solo work in the future or neither do we have any plans for it. TVXQ! is a group that puts group and team first"". Finally, Changmin and Yunho released mini albums in 2015 but they didn't promote them solo.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**4. ""Rising Sun"" in Fast &amp; Furious 4**

&amp;#x200B;

TVXQ!'s 2nd studio album's title track 'Rising Sun' was featured in the blockbuster movie 'Fast &amp; Furious 4,' during Paul Walker's opening scene.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**5. 2 Times they were on the Guinness World Record**

&amp;#x200B;

TVXQ was recorded in Guinness Book of World Records as having the largest official -paid- fan club back in 2008. Apart from international fan clubs and the official Japanese fan club BigEast; the official Korean fan club, Cassiopeia, had well over 800,000 members. TVXQ!'s Korea fan club closed in 2009, after the split of TVXQ!.

&amp;#x200B;

TVXQ! also put their names on the Guinness Book of World Records for being the most photographed group back in 2009. Through their official activities, the group was photographed over 500 million times.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Historic Win on Japan's Kohaku Uta Gassen**

 

TVXQ! participated on Japan's year-end show Kohaku Uta Gassen in 2008, 2009 and 2011. In 2011, they recorded a historic win. Besides bringing in 42.6% viewership, TVXQ! obtained 49.7% of the total votes cast, leaving 21 top artists such as Arashi, SMAP, AKB48, Perfume, Girls' Generation,and KARA behind, winning 1st place with a record of almost half the total votes. The voting was only open to those within Japan, and Korean fans, as well as international fans, were not able to participate. After excluding the repeated votes, TVXQ! maintained the 1st place with a shocking 65.3% of the total votes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**7. One of The Big 3 in Japanese Live Scene**

&amp;#x200B;

Japan is a country where Asian groups and singers do concert tours a lot. On May 14, 2015, Kei Nishiyama, chairman of online ticketing site Ticket Street called TVXQ! as one of Japan Live Scene 'Big 3' along with Arashi and EXILE. Kei Nishiyama stated, ""The BIG 3 in the Japanese live scene today are Arashi, TVXQ! and EXILE. More than 40% of Avex-held dome-stadium level concerts were TVXQ!. Avex will show a big decrease in revenue due to TVXQ!'s upcoming enlistment.""

&amp;#x200B;

He also released the list of 'Artists with the hardest to get concert tickets in Japan'. TVXQ! ranked #2!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**8. The Members Were Initially Disappointed at the Group's Name**

&amp;#x200B;

When Lee Soo Man told the members about what name he chose for them (TVXQ!, which means 'Rising Gods of the East'), the members were very disappointed... Jaejoong and Yunho even cried!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Highest-Grossing Earning  K-Pop Group**

&amp;#x200B;

On December 31, 2009, tvN ENEWS 'Blackbox' revealed the top earners of 2009 in Korea. TVXQ! ranked 1st with a revenue figure of $109M USD, followed by Rain ($53M USD) and Big Bang ($17M USD).

On November 25, 2013, Korean media outlet Sports Seoul reported that TVXQ! made a career revenue of $1.1 Billion USD up to that point.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 22, 2018, Korean media outlet Cidermics reported that TVXQ! made a career revenue of $2 Billion USD up to that point, which makes them the highest earning K-Pop group in history.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**10. They were Offered The Role as F4 in Boys Over Flowers**

&amp;#x200B;

Almost everyone knows about Boys Over Flowers and it's Legendary F4 (Lee Minho, Kim Hyungjoong, Kim Bum,and Kim Joon). 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2007, when the publisher was in the planning stages to produce the Japanese manga 'Hana Yori Dango' into a Korean drama, they wanted to cast the 4 members of TVXQ! as F4, and the plan had been specifically discussed. However, TVXQ!s overseas activities in Asia made it impossible to spare time for the drama shooting, so they had to politely decline the offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though they didnt make it, but its still fun to guess which TVXQ! member gets which role in the 4 men of F4, right?

It's such a difficult topic I think and I wish everybody could be more relaxed about it. But I can also understand when a male, straight idol feels a bit uncomfortable when a fanboy wants to hold hands for example, because they temselves are straight, and because of the taboo that is still alive. I hope I got my point across, english is not my first language.

ITZY great way to kick off the new year!",NudePenguin69,1548197264,"Another year of Kpop and another year of giveaways!  We gave away 117 brand new albums to the community last year and supported some groups that could really use the support while we were at it!  Lets do it again this year!

Its that group we have all been waiting for...ITZY is finally coming.  JYP girl groups are always something to get excited about, so I thought there is no better way to celebrate than by giving away some albums and helping them get off to a great start!

_______________________________________________________________

**If you read any of my previous giveaway posts, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **10** brand new, unopened ITZY ""Everything You Want"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:

*As the version info has not been released yet, I will just ask the winners what version they would like after the drawing*

1.  What excites you most about the group?

2.  Any early picks for a bias?

I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I am adding a new rule this giveaway.  If you are mostly a lurker here on reddit but you are active in the .Kpop discord, you may still enter, just leave your discord name on your entry or PM me if you are uncomfortable having that information public, and I will check your activity on discord and approve your entry accordingly. 

I will leave the entries open for a few weeks and draw the winners near the release date.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

**NEW RULES**

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  This giveaway is for the /r/kpop community and is not a free handout to people who dont contribute here.

*As an aside to my normal post, I just want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!*
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

*I want to note that Australia is unfortunately on the watch list for being restricted for entry because Amazon has stopped delivering to Australia after introducing Amazon.au (which has far less Kpop album stock). Hopefully I don't need to put in that restriction in the future, but I am just giving the heads up.  You may still enter this giveaway if from Australia.*

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.  And just so people know I am not kidding, I can confirm there are multiple people who have won 2+ giveaways.**

2369,2019-01-23,2019,1,23,15,aix0xg,YGs new boy group COULD have been SO much better.,beautifulbatch,1548226321,"Im quite shook how things have unraveled thus far. YG literally had a STACKED roster of really talented trainees, yet YHS choose to shaft the vet trainees (they are also the most popular) and chose to debut the newer trainees with barely any experience. Does Park Jeong Woo have talent? Yeah, hes an excellent singer. Visual, or dancer? Not so much. Hes also super young, his debut could wait. Same exact shit with Jung Hwan and Jae Hyuk. Congrats to them but they can wait their fucking turn lol. 

Its safe to do say YG is going for a more youthful approach? Because a lot of the members are hella young, but imagine how GOOD the treasure group would be with a mature concept with a few more older members (Hyun Suk, Seung Hun, Mashiho) 


Overall, I feel pretty cheated as Im sure the silver boys already do. Honestly I wouldnt be surprised if the final pick is Yoon Bin over Hyun Suk. If Jae Hyuk can debut then why not Do Young? Jae Hyuk can get most improved but he can really sing, and hes LEaRNnInG how to dance. 

Idk man, this group could have been so much better. I saw the ideal lineup in my head and I was like damn this group while singing going crazy would be DOPE. Debut the old trainees, hold off on the new trainees for the next gen. But oh well. Lets hope for the best. ",29,1
2370,2019-01-23,2019,1,23,15,aix15c,Fan Account: Oh My Girl - Houston,CanIRaveWithAOA,1548226368,"Hey everyone! So I know there has already been a couple of fan accounts about Oh My Girl's US tour but I just thought I would add my experience and thoughts in case anyone was on the fence about going or was interested in how the Houston show went! 

As [you can see in my comment on this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/agnli9/schedule_for_oh_my_girl_usa_tour_2019/ee7u7jd/), I was actually on the fence about going. I would have to take a half day off work, get someone to watch my dog and be running on not too much sleep before work again tomorrow. But alas I decided, fuck it, I need to go and can't miss a chance to see a girl group I have stanned for a while now. Figured I might as well do the Meet &amp; Greet as well. I heard about all of the concerns about this tour and I wanted to make sure I showed my support. 

I got off work at 2pm and drove 2 and half hours to Houston from Austin. When I got to the venue, there was already a group of people gathering even though doors weren't open. I was able to get [one of those awesome banners](https://i.imgur.com/jKiF3uc.jpg) and was told to hold them up during Secret Garden and B612. Ended up talking to some people before the staff made us move to another line to get wristbands. Waited here for a bit and talked to the people around me, asking about biases, what other groups you listen to. Got to sneak in a couple ""Stan LOONA""s in there. Eventually they announce that Meet &amp; Greet are actually being picked up so I left the GA line and got [my landyard and laminate](https://i.imgur.com/TMOQWSi.jpg). From here, I waited in line with the rest of the Meet &amp; Greet people. I thought about getting merch but nothing really caught my eye. I wish they were selling their lightstick cause even though I don't collect them or have any, I would have bought one to support. 

Around 6pm they let the Meet &amp; Greet line go in and I did my best to get as close to the front as possible. I saw on Twitter and read how the girls would do tons of fan service and grab people's phones to take videos and what not. I ended up on the right side one person back from the front. Not bad. From here, just talked with the people around me about more K-Pop stuff and actually went to go get more banners because some girls were wondering if there were any left. When I was roaming around trying to find the person with the banners, I noticed the crowd was a decent size. The venue itself was huge and the lines outside didn't look super long so it was a pleasant surprise. Got back to my spot and waited till the show started. 

Once the concert began, I had the time of my life. You never really know how truly pretty, cute and beautiful K-Pop idols are until you see them in person. It was surreal. I took way too many pictures and videos but [here is an example of one I took of Arin](https://i.imgur.com/ATJSdBL.jpg). I can't remember the exact setlist so I will just go over the highlights I remember. [Windy Day was AMAZING.](https://streamable.com/aw74c) I always loved the choreo and seeing it up close was dope. Yooa and Mimi hung out on the right side A TON so I got a lot of waves, kisses, hearts, you name it. These girls were offering a huge amount of fan service such as [during I Found Love](https://streamable.com/se0d8). 

During the Q &amp; A, there was a funny moment where Seunghee got a question along the lines of ""Are you friends with other K-Pop idols?"" I ended up screaming pretty loudly ""TWICE!!!"" and Seunghee actually looked at my direction and said ""TWICE?"" Then she asked the crowd ""Do you know TWICE?"". I was dying, I can't believe my bias actually heard me and acknowledged what I said lmfao. The show continued with more of there title tracks such as [Liar Liar](https://streamable.com/whqw6) and [Coloring Book](https://streamable.com/k8f5w). Coloring Book had a new Mimi rap that was absolute fire. I wish I recorded it. One of the best songs of the night however ended up being [Twilight](https://streamable.com/zxniu). Absolutely loved this B-Side when I first heard it and I was surprised they ended up performing it. 

[Hyojung was forced to do aegyo by Seunghee](https://streamable.com/t4rg3) which was of course ADORABLE. I wish Hyojung did baby shark or some other aegyo song though lol. One of the last songs they performed was [Closer](https://streamable.com/wp487) which gave me all types of feels since it was the song that got me interested in Oh My Girl and to start stanning them. Once they finished, they waited a bit before they came out to end with B612. I honestly wasn't even paying attention to the song since they were doing fan service the entire time. 

It was at this point I tried reaching my phone out and sadly I wasn't lucky enough for them to grab it. HOWEVER! I did get some amazing fan service from Jiho and Mimi. They both shot up my bias list haha. 

[Jiho gave me kisses &lt;3](https://twitter.com/sadmachine24/status/1087909840591179776) &amp; [Mimi gave me the best waves I've ever seen lol](https://streamable.com/uat1t). 

Once that song was over, the show ended and everyone went outside. There was a line for the Meet &amp; Greet so waited there while continuing to discuss the show with those around me and fanboying super hard over my pictures and videos. Eventually they get the Meet and Greet started with the Hi-Touch. Now let me preface this by saying I have done anything like this before so this was all new to me. I legit practiced some Korean to say to them when I was close but I ended up being too nervous and anxious I just spoke English. I told everyone one of them they are cute. I was met with smiles and waves to my delight. When I got to my bias Seunghee, I straight up said ""You're my favorite!"" not knowing whether or not she even understood that. But she ended up covering her mouth with a gasp and said ""Awwwww thank you!!!"" I legit died and went to heaven, I was so happy. Yooa was after Seunghee and I told Yooa ""You're so pretty"". She seemed legit shocked I said that cause she smiled super bright and squeezed my hand pretty hard. My heart definitely skipped a beat.

After the hi-touch we got back in line for the picture. When it was my turn they said ""Hi"" and ""Hello"" in such a cute way. I bowed to them and said ""You all are so cute oh my god"" and they let out an ""Awwwww"". I don't even remember taking the picture it happened so fast lol. I said bye and shook hands with Seunghee before I left. I [got the signed poster](https://i.imgur.com/C1xRLl5.jpg) as I was leaving the venue. Got to my car, sat there a bit processing everything before I drove all the way back to Austin in the rain. 

Overall, I spent $300+ on this trip/event and it was all totally worth it. But a lot of that is because I work full-time and have a career so I have disposable income to spend on things I enjoy. I can understand how it is expensive for students or those who aren't working. Nonetheless, if you have the chance to go see how Oh My Girl, please go. I promise it is worth your time. 

Not sure when I will ever see Oh My Girl again but I am glad I took the chance to see them this time. ",0,1

2377,2019-01-23,2019,1,23,17,aixlvq,Are we officially entering a new generation of Kpop in 2019?,SeasonAndTime,1548231603,"I feel as if generations of Kpop is VERY subjective. Everybody has different opinions on which gen was when and why. This is my personal take on Kpop generations.
1st gen: 1996 - 2003
H.O.T, SechsKies, g.o.d, S.E.S, Fin.KL, etc.
While it may be true that Seo Taiji and the boys are the pioneers of Kpop, Kpop fandom was officially developed during that era.
2nd gen: 2004 - 2011
TVXQ, Super Junior, Big Bang, Girls' Generation, Wonder Girls, 2NE1, etc.
These groups were very much responsible in spreading Kpop through many different countries around the world, especially Asia. 2009 was arguably one of the greatest years in Kpop as well.
3rd gen: 2012 - (Present):
EXO, BTS, TWICE, BLACKPINK, Red Velvet, etc.
Whether you like it or not, Gangnam Style really helped Kpop getting exposed all around the world. Youtube had to change around their system for view counts to be properly done. Currently, technology and media has a huge effect on Kpop because majority of the world has easy access on checking out Kpop. Moreover, there was huge increase of Kpop group debuts in 2012 compared 2011, so competition got fiercer.

So we already have debuts from Cherry Bullet and ONEUS and we will later have TXT, itzy and YG's new boy group. And we're only in January so we can anticipate more promising debuts. Moreover, there has been shocking disbandments for the last year or two. So two questions for you:

1. What is your take on generations of Kpop?
2. Is 2019 going to be the start of a new generation?",48,1

I saw on Twitter and read how the girls would do tons of fan service and grab people's phones to take videos and what not. I ended up on the right side one person back from the front. Not bad. From here, just talked with the people around me about more K-Pop stuff and actually went to go get more banners because some girls were wondering if there were any left. When I was roaming around trying to find the person with the banners, I noticed the crowd was a decent size. The venue itself was huge and the lines outside didn't look super long so it was a pleasant surprise. Got back to my spot and waited till the show started. 

Once the concert began, I had the time of my life. You never really know how truly pretty, cute and beautiful K-Pop idols are until you see them in person. It was surreal. I took way too many pictures and videos but [here is an example of one I took of Arin](https://i.imgur.com/ATJSdBL.jpg). Every time the girls spoke English I melted. I was actually surprised at how well they spoke honestly. Seunghee of course spoke the best English for sure. But I was surprised by Yooa's. I can't remember the exact setlist so I will just go over the highlights I remember. [Windy Day was AMAZING.](https://streamable.com/aw74c) I always loved the choreo and seeing it up close was dope. Yooa and Mimi hung out on the right side A TON so I got a lot of waves, kisses, hearts, you name it. These girls were offering a huge amount of fan service such as [during I Found Love](https://streamable.com/se0d8). 

During the Q &amp; A, there was a funny moment where Seunghee got a question along the lines of ""Are you friends with other K-Pop idols?"" I ended up screaming pretty loudly ""TWICE!!!"" and Seunghee actually looked at my direction and said ""TWICE?"" Then she asked the crowd ""Do you know TWICE?"". I was dying, I can't believe my bias actually heard me and acknowledged what I said lmfao. The show continued with more of their title tracks such as [Liar Liar](https://streamable.com/whqw6) and [Coloring Book](https://streamable.com/k8f5w). Coloring Book had a new Mimi rap that was absolute fire. I wish I recorded it. One of the best songs of the night however ended up being [Twilight](https://streamable.com/zxniu). Absolutely loved this B-Side when I first heard it and I was surprised they ended up performing it. 

[Hyojung was forced to do aegyo by Seunghee](https://streamable.com/t4rg3) which was of course ADORABLE. I wish Hyojung did baby shark or some other aegyo song though lol. One of the last songs they performed was [Closer](https://streamable.com/wp487) which gave me all types of feels since it was the song that got me interested in Oh My Girl and to start stanning them. Once they finished, they waited a bit before they came out to end with B612. I honestly wasn't even paying attention to the song since they were doing fan service the entire time. 

It was at this point I tried reaching my phone out and sadly I wasn't lucky enough for them to grab it. HOWEVER! I did get some amazing fan service from Jiho and Mimi. They both shot up my bias list haha. 

[Jiho gave me a kiss attack &lt;3](https://twitter.com/sadmachine24/status/1087909840591179776)  

[Mimi gave me the best waves I've ever seen lol](https://streamable.com/uat1t). 

Once that song was over, the show ended and everyone went outside. There was a line for the Meet &amp; Greet so I waited there while continuing to discuss the show with those around me and fanboying super hard over my pictures and videos. Eventually they get the Meet and Greet started with the Hi-Touch. Now let me preface this by saying I have never done anything like this before so this was all new to me. I legit practiced some Korean to say to them when I was close but I ended up being too nervous and anxious I just spoke English lol. I told each of them they are so cute. I was met with smiles and waves to my delight. When I got to my bias Seunghee, I straight up said ""You're my favorite!"" not knowing whether or not she would understand. But she ended up covering her mouth with a gasp and said ""Awwwww thank you!!!"" I legit died and went to heaven, I was so happy. Yooa was after Seunghee and I told Yooa ""You're so pretty"". She seemed legit shocked I said that cause she smiled super bright and squeezed my hand pretty hard. My heart definitely skipped a beat.

After the hi-touch we got back in line for the picture. When it was my turn they said ""Hi"" and ""Hello"" in such a cute way. I bowed to them and said ""You all are so cute oh my god"" and they let out an ""Awwwww"". I don't even remember taking the picture, that ""Awwwww"" was all that was in my mind. It happened so fast lol. I hope the picture turns out okay but we will see. I said bye and shook hands with Seunghee before I left. I [got the signed poster](https://i.imgur.com/C1xRLl5.jpg) as I was leaving the venue. Got to my car, sat there a bit processing everything before I drove all the way back to Austin in the rain. 

Overall, I spent $300+ on this trip/event and it was all totally worth it. Though I can understand how it is expensive for students or those who aren't working. Luckily I work full-time and have a career so I have disposable income to spend on things like this. I will admit however the concert is quite short. They had room to perform more songs (A'ing, One Step, Two Steps, Love O'Clock, etc.) to make the concert an extra 15 minutes longer. Nonetheless, if you have the chance to go see Oh My Girl, please go. I promise it is worth your time. The Meet &amp; Greet was worth getting for me but I know it might not be for others. I think just the fact I actually got to meet K-Pop idols was worth it. The signed poster is a prized possession of mine as well now since it is the first item I have in general that is signed by anyone, let alone K-Pop idols. Even though my apartment is full of K-Pop posters, I plan on getting OMG's framed to protect it. 

Not sure when I will ever see Oh My Girl again but I am glad I took the chance to see them this time. I hope everyone who went to the Houston show or any of the ones before had a great time like I did. And I hope everyone who is going to the remaining shows have the time of their lives as well.

2411,2019-01-23,2019,1,23,23,aj04aj,Oh My Girl - Houston fan account,LSUduck,1548253028,"Hi yall! Ill skip some of the details of the show that some have gone over in the previous fan accounts (set list, etc). Instead, Ill just highlight a few things that stood out in my mind from this stop in rough chronological order: 

1. If you bought any wearable merch for local venue pickup, dont expect JSJ to actually have it. Apparently they oversold their tour allotment of the sweatshirts before the Houston gig even opened up and soon reached the same situation with the hats. JSJ is claiming they will ship people the merch they couldnt claim but Im not holding my breath. 

2. Looks like scheduling a show against the Winner show in Dallas and Justin Timberlake in Houston was a poor choice. I think there were only 200-250 people there after doors open with maybe another 100 doing their best to fill in the gaps just before showtime. I hope the standing only crowd made it seem more full than it was so the girls were happy. 

3. Crowd energy was solid. Lots of cheering and noise for the size of the crowd. Not too many light sticks in the crowd but enough including me to make an impact! 

4. The Q&amp;A session was quite funny! YooA was asked Have you ever had Chik-fil-A? which had to be explained to her but she seemed excited to try it when she got the translation! How did Atlanta not ask that first? Haha Also, there was a question about being friends with other idols. I cant remember who was originally answering but when some of them mentioned TWICE as being friends with them the crowd erupted in one of the most enthusiastic (almost too enthusiastic) cheers of the night. Mimi seemed a little taken aback by the big cheer and gave the crowd little vocal jabs about it later on like Are you gonna miss us as much as youd miss TWICE? It was all in good fun and was a highlight of the night for sure. I am glad I didnt wear my Twice jacket into the venue though! Haha

5. Lastly, it seems the one thing JSJ can do efficiently is get through the show. This show was completely done by 8:10 so a few minutes shorter than the others. 

All in all, I had a blast! I adore OMG so much and the show was well worth it for a fan like me. Like others have said, more casual fans or k-pop novices may be less satisfied. For those wondering, I did not stay for the q&amp;a. Seemed to be a decent number partaking in that opportunity though! 

Anyways, signing off! Hope this was informative for yall! ",15,1

2439,2019-01-24,2019,1,24,4,aj3p2g,DAY6 in Berlin or the day Jae made fun of me,curlychan,1548273177,"Strap up, boys and girls, this is gonna be a very long one!

I've been a huge fan of DAY6 since You Were Beautiful and when they announced there would be European dates of the Youth tour I knew I'm going 100%. In some bizarre twist of fate my boyfriend and Jae have been DMing each other for almost a year now (initiated by Jae) and after failing to meet in Korea a few times due to bad timing and such, Jae had said that they definitely should if we're indeed going to one of the stops.

So Monday evening we're flying in to Berlin for Tuesday's concert. I'm just thinking to myself what are the chances we see them at the airport as we pass by the baggage claim and I see a group of Asian men in parkas and face masks. Only one of them didn't have a mask on, had a brown-purpleish hair and I tell him ""I think this is DAY6 and that's Jae"". We stopped and I stared for about a minute more, recognised Wonpil's eyes above the mask, but ultimately we didn't feel like bothering him/them there. We go out, there were fansites and local fans waiting for them confirming it was indeed DAY6 so we stopped a bit further from the exit to see what will happen. We weren't even sure if they would come our way but they did and I managed to recognise Young K and Dowoon as well. Later on, my bf and Jae were chatting and he said he'll put us on a meet and greet list. I was obviously majorly freaking out at that point haha.

Day of the concert - no comment on MMT's piss poor management of queuing up for wristbands in the freezing cold. Honestly, I'm not even convinced they had any staff there. Everyone I saw throughout the day seemed to either be Korean staff traveling with DAY6 or staff from the venue itself. Anyway, we made it in. We were in the back of the VVIP/VIP area and I'm rather short but it seemed like I would be able to see them fine. They came out with I Smile and for the first few songs I was a bit self conscious about what to do with my arms and my lightband but soon enough I was jamming hard hah. They were just as amazing live as I had imagined and since they don't have a bad song and I know them all it was hands down my favourite kpop concert experience so far. People were very excited for Dowoon's ""Hey!"" and ""Babe, be lazy!"" and for everything else of course. After Shoot Me they played the chorus again for us to sing but that one's pretty easy I'd say. Young K made us sing Man in a Movie afterwards which is tougher but we pulled through and then Wonpil - I'm Serious. 

The last segment before the encore started with Congratulations and as usual they let us sing the first verses as well. Jae's was a bit wonky I feel but then Sungjin's turned out quite impressive judging by his surprised facial expressions haha. They took over after that and I'm glad cause it's my favourite song and I definitely wanted to hear them sing it. After that was You Were Beautiful and I totally cried a tiny bit cause it's sad and it was the song that led me there I guess. After I Loved You and I Like You they went off stage and boy, the sudden realisation that your feet and back are killing you and you're mega thirsty and starving was not fun. There was a cute video of them filming themselves goofing around somewhere in Korea after but I barely watched it cause I was trying to find a way for my back to hurt less. When they returned for the encore, suddenly I didn't feel anything anymore hahaha - the actual power of music. Squeezed my last ounces of energy to sing and wave and do hearts during Freely and Sing Me and then it was over  You can find the full set list [here](https://twitter.com/ParkKangKimYoon/status/1087799427085959168) - a surprising amount of love for Daydream songs imo, didn't expect it. Also sad they didn't do more from Remember Us, the rock songs would have slapped.

I say over, but not really cause there was said meet and greet about to happen. I had no idea if it would be only Jae or the whole group but I was sure I would lose my ability to speak either way - I'm shy around most people, let alone kpop stars lol. A lady from their Korean staff found my bf and I and took us to a small room backstage and asked us to wait. After a minute during which my heart beat was going at around 200 Jae pokes his head in and then there was a bro hug and omg we finally meet, etc etc. I shook his hand and managed to blurt out my name. He was super surprised that we had bought tickets ourselves instead of asking him lol, such a cute. My bf showed him his glowing lightband (mine had died already) and his voice was also dead so he was full on fan mode, Jae was laughing and couldn't quite believe it. Maybe most of his friends aren't as passionate about his music haha. Anyway he said that we should go to Korea and he'll treat us to a tasty meal in return pfft. Then he was saying something like ""I don't know what you guys thought, but I think this was pretty good, people were singing a lot.."", to which I responded with ""It was the best shit ever!"" cause honestly it was and he should know it haha. He was like ""riiight"" and gave me a bro handclasp which I didn't fail and felt very proud of myself. They talked about esports and streaming and stuff for a few more minutes and then he said he needs to go to get ready for the hi touch. He was again being all ""you're crazy, you have that too right?!"" which we did of course and he said he'll see us out there then. He thanked us again for coming and I think we shook hands again and then he left. Can confirm he's very handsome and genuine and nice and easy going and down to earth and everything else good you think of him.

The staff lady then took us to the area the other people were waiting for the hi touch. I spent the next minutes feeling pretty stupid for not saying more to him but they were having a nice chill friendly conversation and all the things I had thought to myself I could say were too fangirlish. Not in a creepy way but stuff like how I found their music, my favourite songs, having all their albums, how invested I was in everyday6 and especially the video trilogy in the second half of the year... My bf was telling me that I did just fine but as you will find out, he was wrong.

For the hi touch they brought out this thing behind them in this [photo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxkvUusX0AAXzHU.jpg) and a table in front of it. The back of it ended up right next to where we were standing and we saw Young K was last cause he peaked from the side. Then I noticed Jae's converse were on the other side so apparently he was first. I was like totally not mentally ready when it was our turn but what can you do. I was in front of my bf in the line and we go around the corner to where DAY6 are and I see it's going pretty slow (much slower than my previous experience with KARD which was 5 seconds total). So I roll up to Jae, we're high fiving, I think he started saying something, probably thank you again but I said ""Thank you for singing"" with like a lot of passion behind it before he could and he.. laughs?? Like those really big hearty laughs you know from jaesix. I was like did he not expect something so deep or what just happened and was pretty confused all around but didn't stick around for a response cause the girl in front of me had moved already. Next was Wonpil and then Dowoon to both of which I just said ""thank you"" cause my brain was mush. To Sungjin I managed to say ""thank you for singing"" as well and he smiled and I think he responded with danke haha. And then it was brilliant genius Young K, I managed to say all of ""thank you for singing and for writing all these songs"" and he was really looking me in the eyes and acknowledging what I said and smiling and saying thank you, and oh my god it was emotional. My bf was like ""wow he was really looking at you, you must have said something thoughtful"" so I told him what it was. And then he tells me ""Jae said now she talks"" and I'm ""you're joking right??"". ""Nope, that's exactly what he said after he stopped laughing"". ???? I couldn't decide if I should be fake outraged or kinda proud cause you know, how many people can say Jae made fun of them? 

I spent the rest of the night in a daze and just reliving the hi touch in my head. Their songs have been stuck in my head since then but I put one on today and got super sad cause post concert depression is real, folks. If you read all of this, thank you and sorry it's a bit of all over the place. And to those of you about to see them on the rest of the European stops, cherish the time - it will be amazing.

As I was watching, I noticed that I recognized a bit of the music playing in the background, as I had just got off a game of Overwatch a few hours before. Knowing the context of the show when the music is played, I guessed it was the victory theme, and after a bit of digging, I finally came across it on Youtube.

I'm a Panda (Apink fan) and I have listened to many innocent concepts and the new charismatic era of Apink that is being showcased for the last year. Shy Boy is literally one of the most bubbliest and the most aegyo-full song I've ever listened to. I wouldn't listen to it on a daily basis, but when I do, I put it on repeat for a good hour and a half.

Looking back on the year 2018, what are some of the most iconic and/or viral moments from your favorite members and groups that show off their uniqueness and appeal to fans and people in general? This could be them being funny, showing off a positive character trait like showing immense kindness to other members or idol groups or fans, etc.

I figured with the end of 2018 and some of the rough patches that everyone, including kpop groups, went through, we could all reflect on the positive/hilarious moments of 2018 and almost show off the charm of our favorite groups or even a member/group that you might not necessarily stan. This way, either newer kpop fans or just lurkers of the sub can find their first group to stan, or it could show fans of other groups why your favorite group/member is, well, your favorite haha.

For myself, as much as I love all of IZ*ONE's content and the shenanigans they commit in their VLives, variety/reality shows, etc. I think one of the most iconic moments for me was when they performed one of their B-sides from Produce 48, [Rumor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X97R2O7ddBM), at MAMA Japan and just their stage presence, the explosion of cheers from the fans and the performance itself just knocked me off my feet and I knew I found the right group.

The second example for me would be [Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdIkS0vq1oo) at MAMA Hong Kong reacting to Wanna One. For most of the show, he was pretty stone faced and didn't react at all, but the moment his bros got up on stage, he would not stop vibing ",67,1

&amp;#x200B;

Mine would be a sexy GG rookie subunit with Yves from LOONA, Soojin from (G)I-DLE, Saerom from fromis\_9, and Eunbi from IZ\*ONE. Due to age restraints, 3/4 of these girls won't be doing anything remotely sexy with their main groups for a while, so I think that giving these 4 the opportunity to show off their more mature side outside of their groups would be cool! 

&amp;#x200B;

My proposed song would be a R&amp;B jam like Bad Boy, but a bit filthier. The styling would also be edgy and 90s inspired: fishnets, plaid miniskirts, and baggy pants paired with crop tops. The music video would have a girl-gang concept!",9,1

A group music won't suddenly stop being bops because of some fans, a TV show's quality won't drop, a book series won't stop being amazing. I've stop enjoying things and following some artists but only because the quality in their product has dropped/ is not longer to my liking or have gone so long without putting something out there that I'm not longer interested and have moved on to something else, but never for the fandom.",112,1

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that Jaehyuk is ready to debut. He definitely has talent and potential, but at this point, I really just think that YG put him in the final lineup to make the other members shine more in comparison (sorry....). It really seems like he is lacking in well.... everything. His vocals and dancing are questionable, he isn't exceptionally cheerful, and he doesn't really have any charisma. I'm happy that Yedam, Junkyu, and Hyunsuk can finally debut. Haruto and Jeongwoo seem very polished and will work extremely well together as a team. Junghwan is charismatic at times (I guess).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm really hoping YG goes for a WINNER-iKON kind of situation, because there are too many precious trainees that were unable to debut (MASHIHO). In this potential second group, I'm hoping Mashiho, Byounggon, Yoonbin, Doyoung, Seunghoon, and maybe Junhyuk debut.

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone else as disappointed as me?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I'm out here SOBBING because of Mashiho please tell me I'm not alone.",4,1

Second, my wife has no idea Im a big fan of Gfriend. I guess Im a little self conscious of the fact that Im a married dude who likes a girl group band that goes by the name of Gfriend. Also, it might be a little weird for me to be into singers who are generally between the ages of 17-24 (Im 34 and Ive been a kpop fan since the H.O.T. days). 

Also, I have about 1,083 videos marked on my Youtube as watch later, most of which are kpop videos. I dont know how Ill ever get thru those, or why I keep doing that.

2664,2019-01-26,2019,1,26,0,ajq6l2,What are the most popular ships within your favorite group?,Bren42,1548430590,"First, if you're unfamiliar with the term ""ship"" it comes from the word relationship and basically means that its a popular relationship for fans to follow. There are generally two types of shipping as far as I know: the platonic brotherly/best friend kind of skipping and the more intense sexual/lover type of shipping. Shipping also often leads to works of fiction written by fans about it the supported relationship between members known as fanfiction (fanfic).

Anyway, whether people like it or not, shipping tends to be a popular part of k-pop culture that gets fans more invested in idols. On my part I can enjoy platonic ships because its nice to see happy friendships between members in a group I follow. So thinking about this got me curious about what are the most popular ships in other groups.

What are the **most popular ships** in your favorite group? Have they changed overtime (for example [Nu'est's Baekho talked about how the popular pairings shifted from BaekRen to BaekMin](https://youtu.be/1MMrm12iY04?t=2636))? Why do you think that ship is so popular? Please share anything you want about it too like **ship compilations, clips, pics, gifs, fanfics, or anything else**. Let's educate each other!

-

For example in BIGBANG, I think one of the biggest ships is Nyongtory (a.k.a G-Ri) which is a combination of Jiyong (G-Dragon) and Victory (Seungri). One of the reasons this might be so popular is because [GD basically ignored Seungri](https://youtu.be/Xb3rIaOOMr8?t=2904) when he first joined the group, but then they got closer as they were roommates and now seem very fond of each other. They even teased each other so much (GD much more so) that they earned the nickname [Tom and Jerry](https://youtu.be/Oo1Q3moZb4E?t=574). Nowadays GD is often laughing at Seungri or being a proud big bro. They totally [know about this ship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbpd2Iji4Vk) though and [play it up for the fans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUU3HUaZOOc) and it's [hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGJ7OHk7Tl0).",34,1

I tend to stan groups from the big 3 mainly because I find it easier to connect with them on a personal level. Since most of them will send them abroad to tour and they have large international following leading to all their v lives/variety show appearances having English subs. Does this happen much with groups outside of those companies? I know there are some outliers such as Seventeen,Monsta X, BTS but it seems mainly between those 3 companies. ",88,1

Do you think any other girl groups have a chance at getting to their level in 2019?

I think (g)i-dle might have a good chance. Pretty well known company (for better or for worse), arguably one of the best female rappers in kpop right now, good mix of visuals/vocals/dance and their collaboration with League of Legends seemed to be a hit.

2699,2019-01-26,2019,1,26,11,ajwlho,What are your thoughts on the final Treasure 7 lineup?,G1Fream,1548468656,"The final lineup for YG's new boy group, from the survival show ""YG Treasure Box,"" was announced recently. If you've been following YGTB, you probably have some strong opinions about the final group. The members are:


1.  Haruto


2.  Yedam


3. Junghwan


4. Junkyu


5. Jeongwoo


6. Jaehyuk


7. Hyunsuk


First and foremost, I'm really not happy with the way the final group was presented. When I saw that the final episode of Treasure Box was an hour and a half long instead of an hour, I thought ""Oh finally we get to know the full group,"" but YG only revealed 4 of the 7 members in the final episode (Those would be Haruto, Yedam, Junghwan, and Junkyu). The other 3 were revealed, 1 person every other day throughout this week, on the Treasure Box Vlive page. I wish we could have seen the final group then and there in the episode. The online reveal just seems like a cheap way to build hype.


I'm happy Yedam FINALLY gets to debut. I'm also happy about Haruto and Junkyu. But Junghwan, Jeongwoo, and Jaehyuk? I didn't even know who Junghwan and Jaehyuk were until the last episode. I still hardly know who Jeongwoo is, he's never stood out to me. Honestly the only thing that saved this lineup for me was the reveal that the final member would be Hyunsuk. I've wanted everyone on Treasure A to debut since the first episode, and it looks like this is the closest I'll get to that. I think Seunghun and Byounggon should have been in the final lineup, they both deserve so much more love. I'll still follow this group, I think the older members are crazy talented and I'm anticipating some really good stuff from their career. ",82,1

2725,2019-01-26,2019,1,26,18,ajzfjl,Kpop videos with strong replay value,gingiepops,1548493836,"There are some videos, whether they be MVS, Behind the Scenes clips, variety show moments or live stages, that you can come back to again and again and again without getting sick of them. Maybe it is the aura given off in the performance that is unrivaled, maybe it is a member having incredible wit and perfect comedic timing, maybe it just makes you feel all warm inside. **What are the kpop videos that you can replay like you would your favourite song and never get sick of them?**


This clip of Day6 singing [What Can I Do](https://streamable.com/mmotk) is my #1 favourite. The level of humour rises the longer you watch as Young K gets more and more into his 'Bba Bba'-ing and they all become a vocal band at the end! Their voices are incredible, as expected from Day6, and their laughing and joking throughout makes it a really nice feel-good video to revisit if I need a cheer up. 


Another one is [Seventeen being 100% in sync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWMl-L-eZkA). Watching a normal Seventeen dance practice is mesmerising enough, but to combine the most syncronised parts of those clips into one ultimate clip absolutely takes the cake!",67,1

I didn't have time to finish calculating and completing the reviews from last week's artist spotlight with AOA, but I wanted to actually return back to posting these on Saturday's like they are normally scheduled, so here are the songs, let's go! I will edit this section later once I update the scores. Here are this week's songs!

1. [Red Velvet - Sappy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJ3Pq74H4c)
2. [Yubin - Thank U Soooo Much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiCDZYdPmys)
3. [Favorite - Loca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4nZjrXc1BQ)
4. [Paul Kim - Traffic Light ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uhXu3YvEE0)
5. [Monsta X - Lost in the Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uhXu3YvEE0)
6. [MV] [GOT7 - Fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vFviZ4qw0)
7. [fromis_9 - Glass Shoes ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2TtQYuFfWw)

You know what to do! Seven songs are up for review, so you get to talk about them and leave any thoughts, be they praise or criticism, about the song! Alongside your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10, with a score of 1 being the lowest (this song does not fit like a glass shoe to your ears) and 10 being the highest (this song makes you say ""Thank you sooooo much Yubin!). If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you consider the MV in your review - totally optional and up to you! Feel free to review one songs or all of them! If you are still a bit confused/unclear as what to do, you can always say HEY!

At least with Western artists Ive grown up with Ive never wondered where they stand on LGBT issues. I know people might say you should just focus on the music but personally its just something very important to how I view an artist. But like everyone says S Korea is pretty conservative compared to America so you wont really find many out idols and theres not really much representation. I dont really mean for this discussion to bash idols for things that theyve said which might be anti lgbt. But Im hoping people might have suggestions for groups that either have made friendly gestures towards the LGBT community or at least seem to be open minded. I ended up stanning Seventeen and Twice because they seemed like really genuine idols who probably love everybody lol. Do you have any suggestions for groups who you would recommend to an LGBT friend?,1,1

2788,2019-01-27,2019,1,27,12,ak8bhf,Why has the increase in girl group album sales for the 3rd gen paled in comparison to the increase in boy group sales?,brandywise,1548559052,"I was just thinking about this, but if we discount the first gen (where the internet/streaming didn't take such a big bite out of physical sales), third generation boy group sales seem to have gotten a lot higher over the second generation. Boy groups like EXO, Wanna One and BTS are capable of selling so much more than huge boy groups like Super Junior, Big Bang, Infinite, 2pm etc. And I think that is just reflective of how big hallyu has grown since the golden era.

Yet, while girl group physical sales have also increased, with groups like Twice, BP and IZONE able to sell 100K on hanteo, I feel like the increase over 2nd generation girl groups isn't nearly as big given just how much Kpop has gotten bigger globally.

What's going wrong? What are the contributing factors for gg album sales being still so relatively low (and I'm not thinking in terms of combining the sales of each album in every language/territory a group puts out - I'm thinking ""sales"" more in terms of what each individual album - repacks separate - a group is capable of selling)? What does the industry need to do in order to make ggs sell more albums? Or is it simply a gender disparity or cultural idiosyncrasy we have to learn to accept?

I mean we can say girls will never sell as much as guys, but I mean, in other countries (Japan, US, Britain) we have huge sales coming from female artists - and we've always had that -  so it must be possible somehow.

And just for fun: do you think there will ever be a female artist to pull in Wanna One (at least) numbers for each album? How would a gg like that need to operate (in terms of promotional tactics, choice and number of members, type of music, image etc) to do so?",104,1

He sounds like he used to be really hard on Rain, and then there's the abuse Jay Park has mentioned receiving from trainers (not PJY himself) in the mid 2000s. He said it got better since then though. Theres also the time in 2014 that Taecyeon complained about bad management, and I don't know if thats changed since then. I also don't know what caused such a (lowkey) premature disbandment of two huge girl groups like WG and MA.

Now I see PJY doing things like being involved with his artists music, giving Park Jimin recognition when she complained about it, saying he picks his trainees with their personality in mind, making the dating ban shorter because ""no one was following it"", and portraying his label like the family YG is supposed to be :)

I've only been around since 2009 and even with what i dig up from the past theres years of things happening that I still have to figure out. This is one of them.

2868,2019-01-28,2019,1,28,11,akis3z,Why 9MUSES is not a success in Korea?,latis_sean,1548641983,"Before their debut, Nine Muses received a massive interest and high expectations from Koreans as they reveal concept photos and their uniqueness. Most members are originally models who are long-legged, charismatic and beautiful. Some questioned their talents in dancing, especially singing. But still, there was no doubt that they will not succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Until Nine Muses debuted on 2010 with their song, 'No Playboy'. The song is bop, the MV is classy but to get into the point, the girl group failed to reach the expectations of Koreans. They implied that Nine Muses lacked in confidence while performing the debut stage, plus their live vocals was terrible. Nine Muses' debut was even crowned as 'Horrible Debut' that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Koreans once compared them to Girls Generation and suspecting them as copycats.

&amp;#x200B;

The company put a lot of effort for this debut and they saw a drastic differences of their group compared to other rookie groups such as SECRET and SISTAR through various music charts.

&amp;#x200B;

On the following years, 9MUSES became a hit as they stabilize their presence on TV.. their songs are so great, too. The group started to welcome new fans and stable fan bases around the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

2013, for me, was their glorious years. They have released Dolls, Wild, Gun and Glue in the same year. 9MUSES gained a lot of fans during this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

They even climbed on charts drastically until they become a nominee for 1st win on music shows, for the first time after they debuted (DRAMA era). Talents were improved. Image became innovative. They really improved a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

But here's my point...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One member, Jaekyung, leave the group.

&amp;#x200B;

2 members (Rana and Bini) left the group. 

&amp;#x200B;

New member, Hyuna joined the group.

&amp;#x200B;

New member, Kyungri joined, too.

&amp;#x200B;

Eunji and Leesem left, followed by Sera.

&amp;#x200B;

Sungah joined the group.

&amp;#x200B;

Followed by Euaerin and Minha leaving the group.

&amp;#x200B;

Sojin and Keumjo came as new and one of the current members of 9MUSES.

&amp;#x200B;

The original member left was Hyemi.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The point why 9MUSES is not a success in Korea? Members are leaving, since debut. I think this is one of the factors.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, they have a strong fan base internationally until now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a fan since Wild era, I am still looking forward to them until the end. They said once that 9MUSES will stay forever (literally?) and the number of years since they debuted is proving it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is just my opinion as a hardcore 9MUSES fan.. Tell us your thoughts on comments below.",5,1

I had a Korean friend look it over and tell me what it said last night **please note these are in their own words from reading it and not a direct hard translation of exactly what the analysis says word for word** 

Here is the link to it for anyone who wants to read it for themselves https://www.hanaw.com/download/research/FileServer/WEB/industry/industry/2019/01/22/edit02_Ent_190122.pdf 

And here we go, everything after this line is their translation: 

That companies are gonna invest more outside of Korea seeing the success of BTS. They will invest in the upcoming big rookies this year: BIGHIt TxT, YGTB, Brand new music group, and JYP girl group ITZY. We can except a lot of American tours with the current top groups, and the growth of sales got much more compared to 2015 with a grow of 39%, companies are gonna focus more (not too much though) on the YouTube views, like how BTS and Blackpink are having a lot of views etc, they are saying that this produce group who is upcoming will be the most successful out of all of the Produce groups???, they are mentioning that JYP ITZY is having the most hype here and that investors are interested in them a lot, they are expecting that Kpop will have a huge global Fandom compared to all of the years.

Page 17 is talking about YGTB, Brand new music boygroup, And TxT: 
2019 is the year for boygroup stans cause these boygroups are gonna debut this year, the most anticipated boygroups of 2019.  The most influential boygroup is Bran new music boygroup, thanks to the succes of Produce 101 season 2, these 2 boytrainees daehwi and Woojin will bring a lot of popularity, their rival aka the little brothers of BTS TxT they have a lot of hype since they are the juniors of bts, and it is natural for them to secure a amazingly big global fandom. The rival for TxT is none other then YGTB, their views, and subscribers on their V-live and YouTube is huge for a boygroup who didnt even debut, their only Japanese member and has According to this article the most important position in the group. They are expecting that this boygroup will have a huge fandom like Ikon. They have a lot of Attention from J-netz thanks to Haruto, their fan base is said to be much higher then what people expect it to be, The biggest contender is the boygroup that is coming from Produce X. They are mentioning that this will be the most successful season of out of all the produce series.

Page 18: the competition of this year Girl groups will be hard cause of JYPNGG: ITZY. Main member Ryujin who appeared on Mix9, the BTS reel, and the survival show of Straykids has the most eyes in the group, the group is gonna earn a lot for JYP, and they will go down the girl@crush side. According to this article, their contender for the ROTY is none other then Cherry bullet of FNC. Their concept makes them different to AOA and are going to lead the company to a lot. Their YouTube channel got views more views then expected.

Page: 22 basically they are saying that Huge artists ended up having Collabs with Kpop groups which was a lot last year. Giving this international eyes and they are expecting only more collabs this year.

Page 23/24: The big groups: EXO,Red Velvet, TWICE, BTS, GOT7, Monsta X, and Blackpink will hold American tours. They are expecting that StrayKids and Winner will have a tour in the US too.

Page 27: JYP is planning to debut groups in Japan and China, and a Chinese boygroup will sign under the same label as BoyStory (Trainee Yao Chen Group), they will sign their Japanese girl group under a subsidiary label in Japan and they will debut in the second half of the year. SM is doing something similar and introduced Wayv which is a Chinese based boygroup. They are mentioning a unexpected US Entry with a NCT group which isnt NCT127. They Arent sure but YG will probably debut his first foreign group which consists of Japanese trainees who were eliminated from YG Treasure box.

Page 29: they are basically talking about that many group debuts will occur this year. The global popularity will just become huge and huge for the Kpop community. Kpop agencies will again push their groups to Japan cause the Japanese fandom there lasts long and TVXQ and 2PM is the proof of that. This is auditioning debuts of a all Chinese, Japanese groups so that the risks of Political issues will be gone. Girl groups will hold Japanese Dome your, And North American tours too,  the fandoms and additional people coming to Kpop is huge, JYP will debut 3 groups which one is already revealed off. And A Australia tour too.

Big3 Plans: 

SM: Their rookie years for their groups are really low compared to the BIG3, but they still hold the strongest groups currently. SM was the company that got affected the most thanks to the THAAD issue, hence why the debut of Wayv got postponed. NCT will release 12?!? Albums this year and their sales including with that of TVXQ will  be 1.5 billion won. A global tour for EXO, and Red velvet, and a tour for NCT are expected. Military enlistments for: SHINee Minho and Key, And EXO  Xuimin.  SM will focus a lot on NCT this year debuting varied Units. No new girl group debut this year.

JYP Entertaiment: JYP will debut from now till 2020 5 idol groups. They mentioned again on the article that they will have a 2 year gap of all the 5 idol groups. Straykids are expected to go on tour, and ITZY and StrayKids are invested on a lot by JYP. The Japanese dome/arena tour of Twice. If you include the sales of Japan for Twice, GOT7, and soon 2PM Japanese solos they are thinking that it is 1.5 billion won. Even though StrayKids won ROTY, their competition this year will be big, cause of the debut of BNM boygroup, YGTB, TxT.

YG: They expect the treasure box group to bring the largest album sales of any YG group. Clearly emphasizing it is meant to be a fandom based group.

Basically clich stuff that comes up a lot in kpop music videos. **What I remember:**

-The body roll was for sure one of things you drank to. 

-The lineup or squat mightve been one of them.

-The channel had a main reaction guy (wasnt a girl)

-He shot some videos drinking alcohol but for the sober videos I think he just drank water.

-The videos I saw, he was reacting to girl groups (maybe SISTAR or AOA)

-Video was shot with a high quality camera (not randomly shot in someones basement or a messy area)  

-I think the main guy was white

Please help me- Ive looked everywhere on youtube, but it seems like a lot of people drink to kpop videos now. This guy had an actual **list** of things to look for in the music videos as he reacted to them, and I thought it was pretty original. Idk if he still makes videos anymore tho, but if he does Id love to support his channel! ",4,1

After BTS world tour, **""Love Yourself Tour""**, finished its encore shows on August 25 and 26, in 2018, [BTS Twitter official account](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit) released a piece of exciting news for ARMY on December 13, 2018.   


For those BTS fans who cannot attend the shows around the world, now also have a chance to experience performances brought by BTS. A concert film, **""Love Yourself in Seoul""**, takes place during BTS Love Yourself Tour at Seoul Olympic Stadium, was released on January 26, 201,9 worldwide in 95 countries.

Early on November 15, 2018, BTS film [**""Burn the Stage: The Movie""**](https://www.vidpaw.com/Burn%20the%20Stage:%20The%20Movie) was released as a documentary film to BTS **""The Wings Tour""** in 2017. The heated response of ARMY has made the film set a record high, opening to over $14 million from 1.4 million admissions box globally, which beats One Direction's previous record - 1.2 million missions - in 2014.  


Download the trailer: [https://www.vidpaw.com/youtube/g4LluD7HSjc](https://www.vidpaw.com/youtube/g4LluD7HSjc)

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, the success of Burn the Stage made BTS spread its reputation and grew incredible popularity in western countries. Since 2016, BTS began to invade and gradually take off the western market. It's not an easy task to achieve that since PSY, who first got well-known around the world by releasing **""Gangnam Style""** in 2012.

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly, BTS did it within 2 years, and they are still growing up with dramatically fast speed. In 2017, the music video **""DNA""** broke many records, enabling BTS to best Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, win the [**Billboard Top Social Artist**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Music_Award_for_Top_Social_Artist) title. In the same year, BTS members were also invited to [**Billboard Music Awards**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Billboard_Music_Awards), which grasped much attention from the U.S. news media and the public.

In 2018, BTS even added more accolades to their list of success. Except for topping Billboard album chart twice with their most recent album, they also won the [**2018 TIME 100 reader** ](http://time.com/5241905/time-100-reader-poll-2018-winner/)poll, and were invited to American famous TV programs such as [**Good Morning America**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America) and [**The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon**](https://www.vidpaw.com/The%20Tonight%20Show%20Starring%20Jimmy%20Fallon). Besides, BTS is also the first K-pop idols whose album can earn an RIAA certification.

&amp;#x200B;

This time, by releasing **""Love Yourself in Seoul""** film, it can bring people from different countries to the same private concert, and enjoy the most wonderful, exciting time with BTS members and their excellent performances. The film will be scheduled in both tradition and ScreenX theaters for up to two weeks (initially said only one day).

Theyre either appreciated for being adorable and lovable or hated for being generic and boring. Its also what comes to mind to a lot of outsiders who dont know much about Kpop.

That being said, what are some Western pop songs you can easily see as cute concepts in KPop?

 [Sometimes - Britney Spears](https://youtu.be/t0bPrt69rag)

((Aka my FAV britney song)) this is literally what your standard cute, bubblegum song in KPop sounds like. Its sweet and innocent. I can easily picture Lovelyz, Loona, or GFriend with this kind of song

 [Candy - Mandy Moore](https://youtu.be/NkVsJGl5d6E)

The lyrics sound like it could be a typical love song in KPop. It has its catchy, infectious parts like Im missing you like candy and YEAHYEAHYEAHYEAHYEAH. 

 [Heartbreaker - Mariah Carey](https://youtu.be/kMCGvtlL4fw)

Her happiest, most bubblegum sounding song  this song has that flirty and playful vibe to it. Also the plot of the music video is definitely something that could be played out in a KPop MV. And the fun choreo too. ",76,1

2918,2019-01-28,2019,1,28,18,aklv0z,190127 GA EXPERIENCE WINNER EVERYWHERE TORONTO TOUR 2019,OG_etherealbangtan,1548667632,"#WINNER EVERYWHERE TORONTO TOUR 2019

Winners First Canadian Concert is held at Sony Centre Performing Art Toronto. 

##**Pre-Concert**

-	Tbh, buying the ticket was on an impulse and i bought it in the day of concert and end up in pretty decent left row lower-level seat

-	Idk if its just me but seating row number was a whole entire different experience, because it was more civilized and less stressful. I had to travel 2 hours and arrived 1 hr early in the concert and honestly not having line-up in cold weather was amazing! 

-	Shoutout to Inner circles who were in discord channel and in general for being so nice! It was such a wholesome experience tbh.


##**Concert Phase**

-	I did not know what to expect tbh because I never saw them perform in real life. What I didnt expect was how flawless they are in real life. Their appearance and voice in real life cannot be justified and depicted through words. Im just in shock

-	They started their performance with Really, Really and idk how much CDs they eat but damn. It exactly sounds the same in real life and much more amazing!

-	I was speaking to a stranger beside me (convo about how long have u stan them) and literally lost my shit when turned the volume louder suddenly bc I couldnt handle it 

-	They mostly performed songs from their album in EVERYD4Y. Their solos was remarkable! Mino did Fiance and Trigger and man he could body rolls for days like their is no tomorrow. His charisma when rapping is just oozing.

-	Kang Seung yoon did a cover from One Direction Baby Its Perfect (i had to search it up im sorry ) but honestly his voice made it feel like he own the song. Its just so powerful that its still resonating in my ears as Im typing. He also performed it rains.

-	Lee Seung Hoon is the definition of a stan attractor bc his performance was just damn. He is the definition of a masterpiece when dancing because he is so precise but smooth and flowing at the same time (u have to see it in real life). He needs to chill too he kept body rolling like there is no tomorrow.The fact is I could not survive any second of it. He is also such a sassy and diva and the intermission videos made Me even stan him more.

-	Jin Woo was just some thing to look at. Everytime i see him on the screen, i remember that i need to close my jaw. He is the definition of a manequin and a true beauty. What i didnt expect was his voice to be that sweet irl. I couldnt stop admiring and listening to his voice.

-	During intermissions, they were trying to speak in english like how was the concert toronto? Or this is our first concert in canada and it holds special place. Anyways, if anyone saw the intermission videos I literally died of laughter. It was basically 4 of them in their childhood and if they found a treasure (coincidence ) what would they do when they grow up. 

-	The only thing I remember was lee seung hoon being the ceo *(somehow i actually see this in the future)* and mino was his secretary. He was discussing his schedule and then somehow it lead to his cute ass aegyo *(dont ask me how but literally everyone was screaming so loud)*

-	Im really happy that this happened bc tbh I thought it would be a VIP perk or something but they did an interview and look for people

-	The first they interviewed was a 30s couple *(um guessing)* and they were asking him whats his favorite song from winner. He said Love me (same) and seung yoon and seung hoon made him sing the song. I think seung yoon was beatboxing in the bg. I think they made him and her kiss in the end its couple goals seriously.

-	The second one was a fanboy from China whos studying in toronto and he kept saying I love mino *(big phat mood cause same)*. He must saved a country bc he got like more than 2 hugs from mino and they also sang okey dokey yo together bc he said that he was his fav idol in smtm *(truth has been preached).*

-	Also they had a phase when they switch to sentimental songs (theyre all my ult faves tbh) and I was crying bc their voices are just so nice... like I literally had goosebumps everytime they start a new song. It just brings nostalgic feelings when they released empty and i was waiting and refreshing for the video to come out in phone 

-	Can we just talk about how amazing Kang Seung yoon range is by hitting the high note cause damn im trully shocked

-	The struggles was (probably happened for everyone) running out of storage in the middle of performance and I didnt know what to do with my life so i had to delete videos from past concerts i went to 

-	In the end, Im glad i impulsively bought the ticket from concert bc that was amazing and I didnt regret any of it honestly

-	i just want to thank Winner and everyone in the concert (all inner circles) for making my future days less depressing

2926,2019-01-28,2019,1,28,21,akn1u5,190127 NCT 127 1st Tour Neo City: Seoul - The Origin,jolaurence,1548679235,"Note: this is very long. 

On January 26 and 27, 2019 here in Seoul, NCT 127 held their first solo concert entitled NCT 127 1ST Tour Neo City: Seoul  The Origin. [That is a mouthful.] I dont know how long I have waited for this concert honestly. Maybe since the day the Rookies program began in 2013. I really have no idea. But I knew I would find myself there one way or the other. Getting a ticket was a battle at first but in the end, I succeeded.

This fan account will be different than most as the tour is just starting. The boys will next be heading to Japan beforethat is to be decided and revealed over time I guess from SM as well as other countries and the promoters in said countries. From my own personal background with a former job I had, it takes a lot of time to figure out the logistics of a location for a tour. My best advice is to wait and not believe every little thing you see online. And for folks in the states, its harder for venues because of sporting teams, especially ones that hold basketball teams. I really dont want to spoil too much of it but I hope with my own descriptions as well as what you have seen with fan cams and pictures online help you get a general idea of the concert. I also hope that you enjoy my experience as well and feel as if you were there. Im going to focus more with the concert on Sunday than on Saturday. I will briefly talk about a few highlights from Saturday.

And with that introduction over, lets get started shall we. First, I will explain a little bit about concert culture here in Korea. One word: Freebies. The concert for Neo City was held at Olympic Park in Songpa-gu. This area is big and wide and that makes it the perfect location for giving away freebies. Fans will give away banners, stickers, pins, etc. for free as well as fansites. Fansites will also allow you to pick up things you have purchased with them as well as hold stock sales.

I told myself when NCT had their first solo concert, I would giveaway my extra fansign albums. I did just that on both days. In case people wonder what some people do with their extra albums, this is what I did. I gave them away for free. Now, a few things to clarify as I can feel some people are just so ????? over this. Albums are EXPENSIVE. Ive seen a lot of Seasonies in the lines get an album from a friend, but it isnt their own album. Their friend had an extra copy for them. I also bought all of these albums during pre-order, first week sales, or the fansign period. Ive been asked several times why I dont sell my extra albums and one of the main reasons I say is that I already spent the money for NCT to get these albums. If I get money back, Im the one getting the money and not them. [Also, my work hours make it impossible to go to the post office.] Also, a huge portion of the fanbase here are students. Ive seen them study in prerec lines for exams all the time. The concert ticket was expensive already and I knew some fans were lucky to go to one performance, let alone two.

Anyway, it was ridiculous seeing the swarms of fans just running for freebies. It was so cool and amazing to see as well. So many people. Just. So many.

I had a lot of friends who flew over for the concert so I made sure to see them or meet up with them and to help them out. For Saturday, I was sitting down and for Sunday I was standing. I was just so excited on Saturday that my lone meal of the day [McBreakfast] kept me until dinner at 10 pm. I hung out with my friends most of Saturday and mentally prepared for my doom aka the concert.

One of the best things that happened though was running into two kfans I have seen at promotions over the past 2 years. I was talking to one of my friends, turned around and suddenly BAM! They were there.

I had connection issues with my phone before the concert started that Saturday so I had literally no idea I was sharing the same air as God himself, Yunho. [YES I AM GONNA TRY AND GO TO ONE OF THE TVXQ CONCERT DATES BECAUSE ONE CANNOT DENY A GOD] That Saturday I was sitting next to a friend of mine who I had met at the fansign back in October so it was really a great experience. Just sitting down, seeing the lightsticks change different colors, just being in the presence of other Seasonies from all overit felt so surreal. I think the closest example I can think of like this is seeing a game of your favorite sports team for the first time and being surrounded with fans like you. That was how it felt that whole night.

The set list was as follows:

* VCR
* Cherry Bomb
* Come Back
* Limitless

* Good Thing
* Touch
* Heartbreaker
* Replay + Firetruck Remix
* Ment
* Simon Says

Followed by the encore of:

* Welcome To My Playground
* Summer 127
* Ment
* 0 Mile

I think the major highlight for everyone on Saturday was seeing Haechan for the first time in over a month. The moment he came from under the stage, we screamed so loud. HAECHAN!!!!!!!!!!!! There were lots of tears. Our little spoiled maknae was back with his hyungs. But, the most memorable moment was when Taeyong and Jaehyun broke their lightsticks.

The boys were very nervous on Saturday. A lot of it was new to them. It was their first solo con after all. The nerves were expected. But they did so good.

Lets just fast forward to Sunday.

Sunday, I was standing. I traded my ticket from N1 to C1 with a fan online as well as gave out the rest of my albums. I was ready for my death this time. I knew exactly where to look for Johnny this time and boy was I ready to try and get his attention [I dont know if it happened at all whoops].

The concert was at 4 pm that day and my section was brought in shortly after 2 pm. I was standing the whole time but was so worth it. Whenever Winwin came on the screen, we all cried with awwwww because we really miss him.

As we waited for the concert to start, we heard that Nana and Jeno were there and suddenly all of us were on twitter to find the pictures. The girls next to me got twitter to work so they shared the photos with us. When we found out it was all of the Dreamies, we collectively freaked out. One of the girls started trying to figure out the exact section they would be sitting in. Then, word started to spread that some of the parents were there that day. I heard one of the girls say in Korean, Mother, hello. Thank you.

As it got closer and closer to 4, we all turned around and heard a commotion. The new Rookies had arrived, all in masks. Of course, we all waved to them even in the standing section. Moments before the concert began, the Dreamies entered. Everyone in seating stood up to wave to them and say hello and all of us in standing turned around waved at them. Staff was telling the seated sections to sit down but no one listened. The kids had arrived.

Right when the lights went down, we all pushed to the front and that was when we knew it was time for the concert to start. I told myself to not push to the very front but be towards the back and move when I needed to. It worked out in the long run. Now, I am a very law abiding person. I never take pictures of concerts with my phone. But, everyone was doing it this time and, to quote the great Lin-Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton, I was not throwing away my shot.

The intro vcr is short but I think its cool. The members then came out one by one and during Cherry Bomb they all got to introduce themselves by dancing while their origin was displayed behind them. Yes, I screamed super loud for Johnny. Everyone in my section needed to know who I was there for.

And now I will talk about each of the individual members and how they did followed by a few stages I think were the best ones.

One thing I found out during the concert was that Seasonies are whipped for Jaehyun and I mean whipped. For Tende, he was right in front of me and all of us couldnt even scream. We just stood there with our mouths open and wide shocked that this man actually is a human. When people say perfect people dont exist, they clearly have not seen Jaehyun. To quote one of my friends after the concert, Jaehyun, we get it. JUST STOP BEING LOUD. Lord Jaehyun. Just. Lord. [And yes I got a Jaehyun focused Tende fancam. I HAVE NO REGRETS.]

Another thing to note is Taeil. This concert was the first time fans got to actually hear his vocals being displayed. His voice is majestic. Its like honey to my ears. Its so good and I just hate how SM doesnt let him showcase it more? Like hello! SM! Give me my vocal line NCT sub unit with the ballads and we would be rolling in money. Taeil just SHONE. I was so happy after hyping up his vocals for two years.

Doyoung though. That boy loves being on stage so much. He just radiates this energy when all he needs to do is sing because its his passion. He cried Sunday as they finished No Longer and all of us moaned as it ended. Doyoung-ah, please dont cry. Doyoung gets so emotional when it comes to singing. You can tell that he is singing it raw and passionate. He just loves being on stage and it really showed over the weekend. His ment on Saturday said that he knows NCT is still lacking in ways but seeing the fans

Jungwoo deserves all the praise in the world. Taeyong actually commented that he worked the hardest out of them all because he had to learn all this choreo in such a short amount of time. Jungwoo got a lot of hate when he joined 127 recently and it breaks my heart because he is the kindest soul in the world. He gives 10000% with everything he does and he deserves a lot of love. Hes loved by 127 as well. I was really happy with him over the weekend and I am seeing his constant improvements.

YUTA! MY MAN! MY OSAKA PRINCE! This is one of the rare moments when I will sayhe tried to wreck me. I was still strong in the end. But, he loves performing so much. He cried giving his ment on Sunday and I cried in response too. He left Japan to follow his dream and to see his dream coming true, he got emotional as did I. Im so excited for him to be in Japan soon for the tour. He will feel so much love there. Also, can SM use him more? His dancing is really good as are his vocals.

HAECHAN! We only saw him for the slower songs in which the boys all sat down, but it was so wonderful seeing him again. We were cooing whenever he talked, as one does when the Sun is in front of them. When he was on stage, he literally radiated the sun. I want him to be with the boys in Japan but his recovery is more important. Please dont be sad, Hyuck. Just get better so we can see you later.

Mark Lee was on another level. His stage presence grows and grows. Im just gonna talk about Baby Dont Like It and Mad City. First of all, those live vocals of his are killer. Deadly. Just dead. I am a ghost. He was just next level Mark Lee brilliance. Then for Mad City. OOF. Take my wallet and my heart Mark Lee. Just do it. Just take everything. And the thing is, Mark is still in the early stages of his career and we havent even seen what he is capable yet. Yet, Mark is just so humble and grounded and says he lacks so much. People who deserve the world: Mark Lee.

Taeyongmy sweet puppy of a leader. He did so good. His rap was on point. His vocals, deadly. His dancing, insane. His stage presence, growing. He is so captivating. Before Regular starts, he is the last one to walk to the center stage. As he walked I had one thought pop up into my head. Hes walking like he owns this place. And he did. I know that over time, Taeyong will get more comfortable on the stage for the concert. This was just the first weekend and on Sunday he looked much more relaxed. He cried on Sunday and I swear my heart broke as he cried. He puts so much pressure on himself and I wish he didnt. You cant be perfect all the time. Were humans. Taeyong, you did so good.

And nowJohnny. Where do I begin? Perhaps saying the word proud would be too little of a statement from me. Hes the reason Im in this world to begin with. His debut literally set a new life path for me. Seeing him on stage and seeing his dreams come true made me feelso.speechless. I dont even have the right words to say it. Every time he was on the stage, he looked so happy. He was smiling the whole time. He was leading the boys with so many of the stages. He looked like a child on Christmas. On Saturday when the piano started and I saw him playing it, I screamed. My only wish for the concert was Johnny playing the piano and it happened. On Sunday during Good Thing, he was standing right in front of me. After his line, I am certain he heard me as I was the loudest shout in the section. He had this huge smile on his face. Im just so, so, so, so, so proud of him for coming this far really. Just. So proud.

Now, my favorite stage of the whole concert was Wake Up. The whole concert was brilliant but what else can you expect from the Queen herself, Rino. The moment Wake Up started on Saturday and the stage began I had only one thought come to mind: Its ABOAB all over again. It is the most beautiful form of art I have ever seen. So much of this concert screamed Rino and this stage literally nailed it. The jungle gym was a playground for the boys. Literally every member destroyed me during this stage. It;s just art.

Another stage that stood out for me was Heartbreaker. It was on the second stage that went up and spun around. Not only were their vocals on point, but the choreo is just deadly. Hip thrusts.

The last stage that really stood out for me was No Longer. It was simple but elegant with the vocal line giving their all.

Anyway, this is already super long. But one thing I want everyone to know is that Seasonies really, really, really love NCT. And NCT? They love Seasonies just as much. Im so happy this concert happened now because theres been so much uncertainty for a while. I hope NCT felt the love we gave them this weekend.

NCT 127, you did fantastic. See you again soon.",9,1

Especially if they haven't showed their talents yet like through covers or something. 
Or am I just taking the hype a bit literally?

I am actually doing a dissertation on K-Pop (how Hallyu influences a non-native English speaking fan's writing creativity), and I would like to make my data richer by asking actual K-Pop fans.

Take note, though, that I may ask for your permission to have your answers included in my research (names screened and all for confidentiality).

So, how does K-Pop (including artists and songs) motivate you? In your hobbies, studies/work and so on? If it doesn't, why do you listen to K-Pop?",50,1

We have 42 hours to get you up to speed on almost 4 years of content before CLC release their 8th mini album and their new title track [No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnfyh38OOHU) on January 30th. So sit down and relax, as I give you all the relevant information you need to know to be prepared for the release. [Ok? Crystal Clear.](https://streamable.com/1lt5n)

&amp;#x200B;

# [THE BASICS](https://imgur.com/a/m7K1eIo)

**Name:** CLC (  ), short for CrystaL Clear

**Fandom:** Cheshire

**Debut:** March 19, 2015

**Members:** 7 (originally 5)

**Known For:**

* [Their duality](https://streamable.com/ok7il). They are indeed masters of the Light and Dark side.
* [Being dorks.](https://streamable.com/o50le)
* [Altruistic and generous](https://www.soompi.com/article/1081753wpp/clc-recognized-promoting-awareness-childhood-diabetes).
* [Cooking lots of food, filming lots of food, and eating A LOT of food.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTUBpqZbu1w)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for a short guide to all the members, then I can think of no better person to introduce you to them than [Sorn herself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6f9oKJWzNY).

&amp;#x200B;

And if there's one series that I encourage everyone to watch, it would be [CLC's Love Chemistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KAzHqUSjvI&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLlUqIXidAsFnxnk9G7DkPWQiAUGGkIRpR&amp;t=0s). Even if you don't really like CLC or their music, I think this is something you *need* to watch. It will leave you feeling good inside, and may even bring a tear to your eye.

He's signed Jessi, HyunA, and E'dawn. This is definitely me generalizing, but I feel like there was general backlash from i-fans about Cube's handling of HyoGate and Jessi remains consistently popular IMHO due to her general Westernised DGAF attitude.

I've read some comments on the subreddit that fans want him to break CL out of the dungeon and I am ON BOARD with that.

Gangnam Style was UNREASONABLY VIRAL and popular. His other singles haven't been successful but still rack up decent/great views on YT (though of course that doesn't necessarily speak to an artist's profitability and wealth building), and I feel like he's developed a lot of connections to Western artists/producers/investors/etc.

_______________________________________________________________

**If you read any of my previous giveaway posts, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **10** brand new, unopened Dreamcatcher ""To be named at a later date"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

*As the version info has not been released yet, I will just ask the winners what version they would like after the drawing*

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:

1.  What is your favorite Dreamcatcher moment?  (Can be a variety show, gif, clip from a performance, ect)

2.  Who is your bias and has it changed since you first got into Dreamcatcher?

I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I am adding a new rule this giveaway.  If you are mostly a lurker here on reddit but you are active in the .Kpop discord, you may still enter, just leave your discord name on your entry or PM me if you are uncomfortable having that information public, and I will check your activity on discord and approve your entry accordingly. 

I will leave the entries open for a few weeks and draw the winners near the release date.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

**NEW RULES**

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  This giveaway is for the /r/kpop community and is not a free handout to people who dont contribute here.

*As an aside to my normal post, I just want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!*
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

*I want to note that Australia is unfortunately on the watch list for being restricted for entry because Amazon has stopped delivering to Australia after introducing Amazon.au (which has far less Kpop album stock). Hopefully I don't need to put in that restriction in the future, but I am just giving the heads up.  You may still enter this giveaway if from Australia.*

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.  And just so people know I am not kidding, I can confirm there are multiple people who have won 2+ giveaways.**

3013,2019-01-29,2019,1,29,12,akw0ms,"If you could choose only five k-pop songs to listen to for the rest of your life, which ones would you choose?",monashah626,1548733611,"This is kind of similar to a 10 ten fav songs or artists or albums list, I guess. 

I'm someone who tends to listen to my favorite music a lot on repeat. I don't tend to explore or branch out for new music. I was looking through my playlist and noticed I still had a lot of older songs that I still jam out to so that got me thinking about which songs I don't think I'll ever get bored of or skip in a playlist.

So 

When you play music you can listen to any other types of music but you can only listen to the five k-pop songs! Which ones could you see your self never being getting tired of? Or which songs have lasted the longest in your playlist? Also do you find any similarities between your choices? 

Mine would be:
* 1) (The Seventh Sense)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA] - NCT U
* 2) (Mitotic)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJS32n6LNQ&amp;frags=pl%2Cwnhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJS32n6LNQ&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn] - TVQX
* 3) (Tonight) - Spica [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VSpBPqBJF8&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn]
* 4) (Been Through)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WOzJF-7mrc&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn] - EXO
* 5) (Crooked)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKhsHGfrFmY&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn] - G-Dragon

Just picking five was so hard, but I can see I tend to go for older artists with a dreamy, ethereal, somewhat wistful vibe!",29,1

3032,2019-01-29,2019,1,29,15,akxbp2,Which Kpop stars have you noticed similarities between?,JustAThrowawayHa,1548743574,"Be it through looks, voices, behavior patterns etc..? 

I was just listening to YDPP's Love it Live it and it still surprises me how similar Lee Kwanghyun and SVT's Hoshi's voices sound, it's almost unreal. I believe they could sing a song together and it would take fans _a while_ to decipher who sings what lines even if there's no voice mods etc. 



Reguarding looks, I know those change as people grow older - a couple of people that looked really similar a couple of years ago don't look anything alike now. 


But I still maintain that Day6's Sungjin and BTS's JungKook are probably related if they go way back up the family tree 

And then there's the ""family"" of SVT's Jun, Heechul, Tzuyu, and IZ*One's Minju and low-key Iz*One's Hyewon.

Looking back, I really did not appreciate the aesthetics of boy groups in 2nd gen 'cause my younger self thought they were too ""edgy"" in their presentation, some wearing eyeliners and some jagged hairstyles, and I thought they were too awkward for my taste. But last year I started to look at kpop again and saw a very different version of male kpop idols. Their aesthetics now leaned more on ""boy next door"" types, very different from the 2nd gen. They seemed more relatable in terms of looks (just my opinion), sporting hairstyles that I would actually like to try. (Not that I'm saying that one generation is better than the other.)

Sometimes Im really happy with the results (Twice getting 12 wins for What is Love?) other times its really devastating (GOT7 being shut out for You Are, Monsta X not winning anything their first few years). 

I love being able to experience a groups comeback by watching their performances on these music shows. But Im beginning to feel like it places undue stress on the artists to not disappoint their fandoms. I also think it can exacerbate fan wars between the groups that are nominated against each other. I read stories of groups really overexerting themselves during comeback time, I think Twice said they sleep like 2 hours a night?

What are your thoughts? Do you think music shows are a good tool for artists to connect with their fans and get their name out there? Or do you think we could go without them and Kpop would move along just fine?",21,1

Currently, the record stands at 6 days by Winner, while IZ*ONE holds the record for girl groups at 10 days. And with big entertainments getting ready to debut new groups this year, the question is simple: which among the current *known* debuting groups have a shot at breaking the record?

Of course, a lot of things have to be considered in breaking this record. Biggest issue imo is the debut date. Will there be any big names coinciding with their debut? Some ents haven't announced the debut date of their new groups yet (TXT, Treasure), so this will be a key factor in breaking down the record. 2nd is the gap between their debut and 1st music show appearance. Also there are a lot more things like reception by the people, the group's popularity pre-debut, etc.

So with all things considered, which among the upcoming rookies have a shot?",24,1

For me, I think about Seventeen's Don't Wanna Cry ALL THE TIME because of how much of a leap it was for them on so many levels. The group known for doing funky fun songs is doing a edm song? alright. The group with quirky and interesting choreography is gonna do some intense emotional dancing? ok. The group with thirteen members and a dedicated rap unit is gonna have an ALL SINGING SONG? DWC is the epitome of ""they really did that, huh"". Like I'll never forget how incredibly blown away I was by it. And it totally set a new tone for them that they're continuing to develop.",125,1
3243,2019-01-31,2019,1,31,12,allfvs,Personalities or Music - what ultimately makes you follow/support a group?,Jennye123,1548906690,"So, as the title imples, what makes you support a group? 

I've asked myself, do I *really* like the song, or do I just enjoy hearing the voices of the people I've come to like?? I was wondering if anybody else has had thoughts along the same line, and if so what do you think? 

I think considering K-pop artists dont always produce their own songs (and sometimes even dislike the songs they're singing) I think personalities have a huge role in attracting people to a group. However, a part of me thinks that since these people want to be artists, shoudn't I hold them accountable to some kind of standard, in regards to the art they produce/represent? Or is this a moot point in the K-pop industry?   
I think for western artists music plays a larger role than personality - Like, Chris Brown is a POS, but I'm ashamed to admit I still keep a favourite song or two of his my playlists.

&amp;#x200B;

Im curious to know what others think regarding this topic.

What do you value most, personalities or music? Do both aspects play an equally important role in attracting fans?

Can these two be seperated? Would you still support a group you enjoyed despite their music being bad?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my personaly experiences:

1) Personality &gt; Music.  

SuJu - I got into Suju through their variety. I followed them for years until one day I was like ""wait, if this song was sung by somebody else it would have never made it it my iPod"", and then my interest just kind of naturally tapered off.  
Would I spend my money on them? - I have in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Music &gt; Personality.  

BLACKPINK - I really enjoy their (small) discography, but their personalities do not really draw me in any further so don't specifically care follow their variety appearences.   
Would I spend my money on them? - No.

ATEEZ - The other day i came across a song by ATEEZ, and decided to listen to the rest of their discography. I was suprised to find out I enjoyed 95% of their discography on the first listen, and now Im like ""oh shit, must avoid getting to know their personalities cuz damn I don't have enough time to stan another group"" (But seriously, I recommend checking out their songs!)

&amp;#x200B;

3) Both equally - is this even possible? 

MONSTA X - Honestly it was the memes that caught my attention first. I thought ""hey these guys seem interesting, lets check out their music"" - dowloaded their whole discography and was initially....quite unimpressed (Read: INITIALLY!). I continued watching their shows, really enjoyed their characters and obviously fell in love with the group. Today the same songs i didnt care for a month ago are suddenly playing on repeat - Its like the songs just SOUND BETTER now?  
Would I spend my money on them? - Yes!

For example, when Idol was released, I was really into BTS, and followed what they were doing and watched Run plus V-Lives. But as time went on I stopped checking content and have almost completely stopped for now. But I guarantee the moment that they release their latest comeback as a group, Ill be all over them again, just from hype alone. 

Variety and other songs (or mixtapes) dont make me keep a group, I just want to see another MV and comeback already, Im impatient lol.

Does anyone fully stan a group for 12 months of the year? How do you follow them so consistently through the year?? I just cant do that",15,1

It made me think that if a girl group would cover Tonight, it would probably sound very very similar to it. I loved watching videos of live performances of tonight so I've been dying to find a live performance version of light me up but to no avail.
