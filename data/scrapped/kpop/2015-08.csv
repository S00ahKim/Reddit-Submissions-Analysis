The shitty iPhone camera returns once again this year, but in a new location! We have upgrade to P2 Floor ""seats,"" which makes the pictures just that much less bad.
 
Only two of your OneHallyu staff members made the trip for the first concert, but rest assured there will be more members tomorrow. By the time we arrived, it was pretty late into the day, most of the convention itself was wrapping up and closing shop for the day, which is why there is no post about the convention itself.
 
We picked up our Fan Engagement/Audience passes and see that we received 2 Got7, 3 Monsta X, 2 Zion.T/Crush, 2 Red Velvet, 2 Block B, and 1 Roy Kim. All of those except RV and Block B had already happened by the time we got them, so those were rendered useless. Nice small gift for one of the staff members though.
 
Concert's about to start, and the venue entry process is much, much more messy than last year. The lines stretched around almost the entirety of the Staples Center, with much of the audience not entering until after the scheduled start time of 7 PM PST, as seen in this picture:

pbs.twing.com/CLXlq4ZUMAExhFw.jpg

 
The concert ended up starting around 30 minutes late, and was opened by a performance of traditional Korean drummers. No pictures were taken as I was not in the venue at the time.

i.imgur.com/WZDcYP6.jpg

Here we have the first MC, Daniel Henney. I wonder if he still remembers OneHallyu.

https://twitter.com/danielhenney/status/365690365937848320

Monsta X = Trespass - Dance Break - One Love - Talk - Honestly

i.imgur.com/ao7wdsAh.jpg

i.imgur.com/63nO4p6h.jpg

Monsta X performed first (as expected). What was not expected was them performing only 3 songs. Even though they do not have many songs of their own, I had expected them to perform at least 1 cover of a song. Nonetheless, they still showed some good energy on the stage, and they looked really happy to be able to perform on such a stage this early into their debut.

Got7 = Dance Intro - Stop Stop It - Just Right - Talk - A - Girls Girls Girls - Bounce (JJ Project)

i.imgur.com/7y7aylzh.jpg

Got7 was the second group to perform. As most of you may know, Jackson was not present for this event. Someone was very sad about this. Even so, the group was able to make up for the lack of Jackson, with Mark taking most of Jackson's lines. The group made sure to mention Jackson as much as possible when they had their talk. Bounce was a somewhat unexpected performance (for me).

i.imgur.com/Eiyrvpch.jpg

The next set of MC's was Super Junior's Leeteuk and Siwon. The arena exploded, seems like most of them were here for Super Junior. Siwon's english is pretty good.

Sistar = Shake It - Touch My Body - Talk - Lead Me - Lovin U - Ma Boy

i.imgur.com/B1q5rHnh.jpg

i.imgur.com/HgWY7rS.jpg

In somewhat of a surprise, Sistar performed 3rd. I expected them to be fourth, don't really understand why Roy Kim performed after them. Not *too* terribly much to say about their set of performances. Well, the Lead Me performance was not expected, that's for sure. Dasom completely forgot her English lines during their talk segment. She had to find the teleprompter and read it off that. I found that funny.

Roy Kim = Home - Talk - Love Love Love - Spring Spring Spring - Lucky with Soyu (Jason Mraz)

i.imgur.com/XFNquLw.jpg

i.imgur.com/tKn9LdC.jpg

As I have already stated, I was surprised that Roy Kim performed 4th. He also performed 1 song less than I had expected, since I expected each group/singer to perform 5 songs like last year. Again, not terribly much to say about his performances, except that they were pretty good and the audience seemed to enjoy them, and the time they were allowed to catch their breaths.

The act most of the audience was waiting for. Suddenly the Staples Center became a ""sea"" of blue. They started off with Knock Out, a very old song that I was struggling to get the name of. They essentially performed 6 songs as most of Oppa Oppa and Rockstar were performed. During their talk, they were talking about Staples Center and basketball. Leeteuk attempted to mimic Kobe Bryant going for a dunk, and ended up falling. The rest of the members couldn't contain their laughter.

That will conclude the first concert. Tune in tomorrow (or a bit later) for the blog of the second concert.",0,1

69,2015-8-2,2015,8,2,19,3fhw0l,[KCONLA 2015] I gave SISTAR's Bora a gift during their brief fanmeet,BoraSeolhyunJeiPanda,1438509705,"Long story short, I got a Hi-Touch pass for SISTAR, and I absolutely love and adore Bora, so I decided that this would be a prime opportunity to give her a small gift.

I picked out a hat because I felt that it fit her style a lot based on the things she wears in photos that I've seen of her. 

I went up on stage and went down the line giving the SISTAR members high-fives, starting with Dasom. For a split second, Soyou might've almost grabbed my gift (I saw her arm move), but perhaps I was just seeing things. I did feel bad for a moment, hoping that wasn't the case.

Bora was last in line, and I high-fived her and handed my gift. She made the most adorable and cutest face as she said ""Ohhh Thank You!"" I was a bit stunned after she said that, and I tried to collect myself a bit to get the most out of the Hi-Touch.

I do not know what will happen to the hat, but I am so happy that I got to share a brief intimate moment with her, and that I made her smile. 

Below are a few photos of me wrapping the hat, as well as a photo of the gift with her. I'm not the guy in that particular photo. (I do not know who took it, but it's been posted on a few SISTAR fan accounts on instagram and tumblr, mainly sistar.news1 and fuckyeahbora)

Saw this on an article I got to from one of the posts here. 

What do you guys think about this? I'm interested in discussing it. Obviously, all groups are not out to simply play on people's fantasies/emotions etc, and most artists are talented people who do what they do because they love music/dance and what have you. BUT I found myself somewhat agreeing with the above statement. Don't most groups (in general - not just KPop but KPop especially) pretty much capitalise off of, well, the boyfriend/girlfriend fantasies of people? Not just restricted to teenage people, but older fans as well. 

I think about the common way that, particularly, girl groups have their MVs shot. In almost every single video I've ever seen (I'm an international fan so I watch SBSPopAsia weekly - I've seen a fair few varied groups) there's some emphasis on the girls pulling the standard close-up ""Look at me being innocent and beautiful"" pose for about a second each, depending on how many girls are in the MV. And, more often than not, the choreography consists of tantalising movements that could draw the eyes of any male (or female for that matter). Most of them have a theme - innocent or bad girl, and both have elements of appeals to fantasies in them.

For boy groups, it's the same but different. Of course there's a fair amount of sexualising going on there too - but it's diluted more in the kind of choreography they have, focusing more on actual dancing rather than, well, butt shaking (I'm looking at you, SISTAR. Those Yoga pants in Shake It were well played lol). They're just as dolled up and also follow main themes, but it seems more varied for them (alternative, nerdy, futuristic, etc etc). Boy groups especially, I would say, really have it easy playing on the fantasies of your average girl (edit: just to clarify, I don't mean their career/work is easy)

What's your opinions? Feel free to correct me wherever I'm wrong, but I'm quite interested in hearing if people agree or not. I've by no means done an in depth analysis or have a wide range of knowledge on the subject. Just your average KPop fan (shout out to SHINee - Your Number introduced me to the world of KPop).",7,0

&gt;You can compose a song even if you can't play any instruments especially after 2000's when writing melodies and lyrics on a pre-made track became a popular form of making music.

&gt;But it limits your creativity since you're writing to a track you didn't make. So learning an instrument and basic music theory enables you to create your own track which means there's absolutely no limit to your creativity.

&gt;That's why the Wondergirls learned there instruments not only to perform on stage but to create there own musical color and it clearly shows on this album.

&gt;I'm so proud of them and their new album!

At the beginning, when YG first announced the name I though it was horrible. It looked like he was trying to copy Apple or something.

However, I actually really like it now. It has a catchiness and distinct quality that manages to differentiate it. Also like how he does not capitalise the 'i'.",21,0

I went to a few fan engagements/panels here and there, nothing seemed to start on time properly but that's expected. 

Also, not sure why KCon doesn't hold the companies/acts to a stricter policy on having the groups altogether (Got7 was missing Jackson), but at the same time, KCon is somewhat at the mercy of the companies. 

Everyone in the upper level seats shouldve been upgraded to lower level seats, both nights I saw plenty of empty seats on the second level. Perhaps they should sell tickets for half price day of the concert or something, I know a lot of my friends only attended the convention because of high ticket prices.",117,26

Rumoured to have been casted so far:
- An unnamed YG trainee
- Yezi of FIESTAR
- Hyorin of SISTAR
- Yubin of the Wonder Girls
- Ahn Soo Min from Show Me The Money 4
- Kasper from Play the Siren
- Jiyeon from Glam
- LE from EXID
- Chanmi from AOA
- Lime from Hello Venus
- Gilme

TL;DR - I will continue to update the list as the reports come out. Will be interesting to see what the actual line up is. I'll throw my two cents in - a friend of mine in Korea who's an underground rapper told me that supposedly a certain underground female MC was already casted from the get go. My friend told me who, but I'm not allowed to say at this point. All I will say is that she's never been in Show Me The Money, and is very seldom on TV, if ever, but her name is familiar to most K-hip-hop heads. That is all~",57,25

This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick,
Im kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky,
ay do you wanna

Its a mistake to call me GD, call me G.O.D
If you want, Ill flip it over and become a D.O.G
Stop memorizing useless formulas but just remember this
Im ILL plus 1 (ill), Jiyongee1
My age is 2 and 7 combined, natural
I never lose, the dealers get cerebral hemorrhages
Wanna be successful? Yes Im the manual
Wanna experience me? Then keep it sexual
I left early from the School of hard knocks, its so sick
Ill shit on all the boring raps without consideration
Dont need to suck up my name value or my label value
Cuz I get applause even when I take a shit
(guess Im famous)
This is the orientation
to welcome your unbelievable fandom
Youre only all talk, saying I have too much money?
My bank account is like a pool table, so many balls2

This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick,
Im kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky,
ay do you wanna

This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick,
Im kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky,
ay do you wanna

T.O.P, people call me a ghost
Da Vinci has come back to life, yea my brain
Your music puts me to sleep, decaffeine
You respect me? Quick, get on the Shinkansen
Francis Bacon in ma kitchen
Im like Calder dancing on top of your head
All you critics who are way too serious, what do you know?
I used to be fat when I was young
so I know the taste of money3

When in Rome, do as the Romans do
All you little kids, go back to your mamas arms
When you see this ground, youll realize your reality
Little boy, hurry and go to mama
Light radiates, it spills over
It overflows from me, Im the one source of inspiration
Anyone can see that Im so sick
Sick with alcohol? They tell me, hes art, so sick4

This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick,
Im kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky,
ay do you wanna
This song is sick, my rap is sick, my style is sick,
Im kinda sick
I shake my legs, I make money, I walk in the sky,
ay do you wanna

This is like Tazza
G-Dra-Goni and Dagils5 collaboration, put on a big smile
Were both tazzas6
G-Dra-Goni and Dagils collaboration
Put in a bullet and bang bang bang

Tonight were getting freaky freaky yea
Baby give me some
give me give me some yea
You and me, were getting electric yea
Can U give me some
give me give me some yea

Tonight were getting freaky freaky yea
Baby give me some
give me give me some yea
You and me, were getting electric yea
Can U give me some
give me give me some yea

-----------------

I absolutely think this song is to troll their fans. TOP is probably going to do his stint in the army soon and Big Bang won't be back for at least another 3-4 years so this is GD seeing what he can get away with.

The ""cuz I get applause even when I take a shit"" line especially stands out because the song is #7 on the Realtime iChart right now and we all know NO OTHER Kpop group would get away with this sort of content and get on the charts.

I applaud this and everything about it. This song is so meta.",16,70

if you'd like to purchase the whole lot (ilu!) then i'd love to give you a deal and sell everything for $100! + *possibly* shipping depending on where you are located

that being said, i would prefer to ship within the US only because that way i can offer you free shipping!^yay!! but if you're abroad and interested, i'd be willing to try to work something out

i'd love to accept payment via paypal as it is the easiest for me and ideally we could do a friends and family transaction to avoid those nasty fees

thanks so much and i hope my items can find a new, happy home! 

edit: the concert and the album are sold! all the magazines are still available though - thanks again everyone

edit2: everything has sold - thanks so much!!!! i'm not sure if i should delete this or leave it up but i'll leave it up for now. srsly, thanks again everyone ",5,7

The name of the girl in the black dress is Seolha (Kim Hyunjung).  She is supposedly preparing to debut in Starship Entertainment's rumored sister group of SISTAR.

Lastly, there is one more trainee I would like to mention that may be included in the group, and that is Kim Nayoon.

There are rumors floating around claiming that she has left the company already, but some people have recently refuted those claims.  Not sure where they are getting their sources from though.  If true, then we might see her in the group as well.

I've been trying to stay up to date on this upcoming girl group for a while, and will look forward to their debut.  In any case, I would also love it if you all can share info on other lesser known trainees from agencies/labels other than Starship Entertainment and ""The Big Three"".",0,1

Or songs that you just consider as classics, regardless of its release date. Or songs with just that strong K-pop vibe.

This is a given, but for me, Gee and Mirotic are really good candidates because these, personally, they are the songs that helped me get into K-pop. But, for the recent releases, Stellar actually released one of the best songs I've heard in a while. Vibrato was just awesome as fuck. Musically, it could be a song which could give people a good impression of K-pop.

And who can forget Gangnam Style and Gentleman.",15,0

The concert itself was amazing, so happy I got to see Vixx and GIRLS GENERATION!!!! Holy crap their entrance made me cry happiness.

It is certainly the first body roll I have ever seen in marching band. What are your thoughts?

Comments: *Decided to create the self-post compilation thread of the KCON NY concert. Recorded mine with the Lumix ZS50 and it was mainly for a test (dry) run. Didn't bother to tweak any proper settings. Zoom levels varied from 25x (Optical) to 60x (Digital). Purchased the tickets last minute anyways. I will probably get a better Point of View for the BIGBANG concert in Oct.*

*Updated more Users that focused on specific Artists. Check 'em out.*

***EDIT (Aug 12^(th)): This thread was created for those who could not attend this concert and relive the moments of these performances. This wasn't created to promote YouTube Channels. I stopped updating this thread after 24 Hours. So if you don't mind, I won't be listing any more Fancams. Thank you for your cooperation and patience.***",30,123

465,2015-8-9,2015,8,9,22,3gcjws,10 types of Retarded K-Pop fans you see everyday these days,[deleted],1439127468,"1. When you see these kind of comments on youtube like these ""(Kpop fandom name) sent me here or i'm an ""kpop fandom name"" and i support this"" LIKE BITCH WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT YOU ARE ENJOY THE FUCKIN MUSIC LIKE DAMN.
2. ""Come to my country please? what about us??"" like bitch if you want your kpop idol to come to your country fix it by contacting some promoters instead of spamming instagram and shit""
3. Hi ""k-pop fandom"" im here to say sorry because of the rude actions from behalf of our fandom"" like bitch who the fuck are you to say sorry for them? and who the fuck cares
4. when people think their idol bias its so hip hop and changed the whole game and its the next combination of 2pac and biggie cause of 1song/1mixtape yet they don't know what their saying or they think they understand cause they're reading a non korean english translation. 
5. When and idol rapper going solo and say one cuss word that you hear everyday in american music shit turns to a fkin war zone. like ""I LOVE YOU BUT WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT WORD????"" FUCK YOU BITCH HE CAN SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS. STOP THINKIN THAT KOREANS ITS SUPER FKIN PURE AND CUTE AND SHIT.
6. When K-Pop fans points out that people are not hip-hop because they sing and rap? yet they dont know that hip hop its also bboying, graffitii or actually a culture. 
7. B FREE Situation. whoever translated that situation should fkin 2 girls 1 cuped. if you who translated that was a korean i feel sorry for your english skills and if you was a non korean person you should stop subbing. this whole situation it's mistranslated by bias people who knows nothing about the korean industry and how brainwashed korean music idol industry is.
8. K-Pop fans be like ""Zion.T, crush, jay park, ELO"" it's my new favorite kpop artists &lt;3333. OMG bitch they're not k-pop niether are they idols. they're not managed by idol company, they can do whatever they want in their music, freedom and their music it's soul, r&amp;b and hip hop. stop think that everything that comes out from kroea it's K-Pop.
9. K-Pop fans be like sns ""PLEASE DEBUT THEM , WHY DONT YOU DEBUT THEM?? DONT YOU CARE ABOUT THEM???"" or be like "" WHAT ABOUT ""KPOP IDOL NAME"" WHEN WILL THEY HAVE A COMEBACK ?? YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT ""A MEMBER IN THEIR GROUP"" WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?? like STFU YOU PUNK ASS BITCH. you're not changing anything like wtf are you trying to do? its not like the company it's going to see your comment and be like ""OH SHE'S/HE'S RIGHT AND TOMORROW ITS GOING TO BE LIKE ""Who's Next?"" Coming Up Next"" ""Teaser Images"" like calm the fuck down.
10. Me for fkin writing this shit for you retarded people to stop doing this shit. years ago we had nothing like this until you people came and spread ebola,aids,cancer,mers and everything related to korean music, sit the fuck down and enjoy instead of arguing on youtube instagram about fandoms, tbh these idols would care a single fuck about you esp when your acting like a crazy fan on sns.

I'm talking, the CHEAPEST ticket is $99 AUD !! Are you kidding?! It got me thinking - is this unusual for KPop groups visiting western countries? What have been your experiences with ticket prices in your country? Part of me is like 'but how can they make money off that?!' but it's Big Bang, people will come.

Here is the full list of ticket prices (AUD) for Sydney (the Melbourne list is more or less the same, but Sydney has a few more options):

- VIP Package - $499.90
- VIP Seating - $499.90
- G.A. Standing - $349.90
- CAT1 Seating - $349.90
- CAT2 Seating - $249.90

^Note: ^For ^some ^reason ^iChart ^listed ^""Turtle ^Ship"" ^twice. ^No ^idea ^what's ^up ^with ^that. ^The ^respective ^weekly ^charts ^have ^slighty ^different ^cut-off ^times ^\(ichart: ^08/03-08/09, ^Melon: ^08/03-08/09, ^Gaon: ^08/02-08/08)



**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",7,13

The quintet has started filming for the MV already and is currently really busy with preparations. Fans outside of the filming location reported that the girls along with Koeun from SM Rookies were found wearing dark makeup after the filming and had heard a strong sensual RNB-Hip Hop inspired song.""

My 2 cents:
Koeun is the same age as Yeri, so her addition to the group is possible, but I thought SM said RV would remain a 5 member group? But they did say recently something along the lines of ""RV will be experiencing a change"", which many took to mean a new genre, but what if it meant a new member? hmmm...",39,0

There are four videos of the girls practicing the covers they would eventually do if they lost during the battles in Episode 5.

Basically, they split Minor and Major teams into two (Major A, Major B, Minor A and Minor B), which would battle each other (Major A x Minor B, Major B x Minor A). The winners would make the Major Team for episode 6 and the losers would battle again, with JYP eliminating one of the girls from the losing team.

Naturally, only the losers had to perform, so the winners never showed what they had prepared. I'm not sure from where are these videos, but I found them on YouTube and decided to share. So here they are:

We've all been huge hip-hop heads before SMTM and before the whole rising Korean hip-hop trend.  One of my crew members actually tried out for SMTM4 but was didn't make it through the first round. Might be a biased opinion, but I personally think he's a lot better than most of the people in the first round (I'm sure they intentionally showed people that were horrible just for the entertainment).  Anyway...

Here's one of our most recent songs ""GS25"" that's going to be in my upcoming mixtape that's dropping later this month.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTJy1QQo3eI

It's a compilation of NGs (bloopers as 'Mericans call it) from a previous music video. Would really appreciate it if you guys gave it a listen and liked our FB page!

I think EXID's [Ah Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j1-xPFaZts&amp;ab_channel=JO_MUMBLESTASH09) album can be cover to cover as well.

Finally, this might just be me reminiscing and whatnot, but I think SNSD's [Girls' Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrv7AtS2Y2k&amp;ab_channel=KpopAlbums) album is cover-to-cover for me as well!

They have songs from BTS, BIGBANG, APink, AOA, and many more songs (no SM songs except for Chen OST)

Gameplay is similar to Tapsonic or Superstar Smtown, though I find this game to have a good range between easy and hard songs. 

You get to collect idols, level them up, equip items for more points. It's a bit difficult to explain, but it's a rhythm rpg :)

You can download only korean appstore. If you have android, use Qooapp for the apk. 

I have created a subreddit for the game, but it still needs alot of work! I hope I can make it a good resource for info/tips.

The game is all in korean, but I'm working on translating it/spreading the word. It's really popular in korea/trending high in the app charts.

I do like this game alot better than superstar smtown and tapsonic, I personally think it's the best kpop rhythm game out so far. ",7,16

^Note: ^The ^respective ^weekly ^charts ^have ^slighty ^different ^cut-off ^times ^\(ichart: ^08/10-08/16, ^Melon: ^08/10-08/16, ^Gaon: ^08/09-08/15)

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of eight major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?serviceGbn=ALL&amp;termGbn=week&amp;hitYear=2015&amp;targetTime=34&amp;nationGbn=K)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",6,13

I am selling four tickets to the Big Bang Concert in Toronto. Two seats in Section 110 (Next to the stage) and Two seats in Section 102 (Across from the stage).

I bought the tickets because I wasn't sure what seats my friend wanted to have (Her birthday present) and now I can't get a refund on them. So the only option is to transfer the tickets. 

Please PM me if you're interested with the price you are willing to pay. I paid $230 (Including fees) each for these tickets.

And wanted a chance to sell to redditors for a cheaper price than eBay or Amazon. So here's a list of all of them with prices, not including shipping. 

If you're in the US shipping will most likely be three bucks for the smaller albums and five dollars for the larger (special edition) and the posters.

Some of the albums come with photocards, some don't. I've included images of all the photocards in the albums!

 I've linked most of them to imgur albums. I got too lazy for the posters/Magazines, so if you want a picture just ask!
EDIT: added pics of requested posters!
Thanks for looking! I might throw in a few kpop stickers/postcards with the shipment for you guys, too :)

First of all I am new to this subreddit so please go easy on me. I went on [faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/faq#wiki_submission_rules) to read the submission rules and it seems that I am allowed to post dance covers...? anyways it seems that I am but no one seems to be posting dance covers here in this sub so I am kind of in a dilemma. 


Anyways here's a short dance cover of [EXO - Call Me Baby](https://youtu.be/rgS4XLPgFL4) my friend and I made last month (I was away for a whole month after that) because the choreo is just cool! We will be doing more covers in the long run but only in a casual manner. We are not the best dancers but our main purpose of our videos is to show support on Kpop by showing how much fun we have by doing so! :D 


I would also like to take this opportunity to do a wave of high fives to all kpoppers here in this subreddit!

So, after having been a casual to slightly more than casual kpop fan for a little over half a year, I realized I have widely different abilities in recognizing and naming different artists, and it doesn't seem to have much correlation with my interest in the group. BigBang was the first group I really cared about, and they are the only group I made an effort to learn the names and to learn who was who. They are also the only group where I can name and recognize every member.

However, there are other groups that I like just as much / more (I don't really have one favorite group). But I never made an effort to learn who was who, so any knowledge I have comes from natural exposure to the group, such as through solo releases, dramas, interviews, or the odd YouTube comment.  Like SHINee where I can list every member in the group, but I literally have no idea what Key or Onew looks like. I can list a few members of SNSD, but I couldn't match those names to any faces. For other groups like 2PM, f(x), Super Junior, 2ne1, BTS, or EXO, I can generally name a few members and recognize a few members without actually knowing their names. And then there are several groups that I really like (Infinite, B2ST, B1A4), meaning I like most of their singles and a fair amount of their on-album tracks, but I could not name or recognize a single member.

So, I was just generally wondering how other people approach this. If it's a group you really like, do you always make an effort to learn their names immediately? Or do you just unintentionally learn names and faces through exposure over a period of time? And do you think knowing or not knowing names and faces effects the ""kpop experience?""",87,52

TGM Events' Eric Nam webpage is immortalized here: https://archive.is/HpxX7 and here: https://web.archive.org/web/20150827051601/http://www.tgment.com/ericnam/
[END OF UPDATE]


I've recently been concerned by TGM Events' multitude of indiscretions in managing K-pop tours in the US and Canada. Primarily, I'm troubled by their failure to grant multiple refunds for a failed IndieGoGo campaign, a canceled Kim Tae Woo tour, and a perpetually postponed Eric Nam tour. 

The Eric Nam tour is the most alarming, because it was scheduled for February under WME Radio, but ticket payments went to TGM. Since June, WME Radio has been silent (with few refunds happening of course between February and June, while WME Radio assured fans that the tour was still postponed, and not cancelled). 

TGM Events has obviously been doing everything it can to keep the heat on WME Radio and wash their own hands of the situation in the eyes of the fans. This worked for about 6 months. 

https://www.facebook.com/WmeRadio/posts/897716523620935

Last week, fans put two and two together and realized that it's actually TGM Events who is in possession the funds. Many of the payments went directly to the personal PayPal account of CEO Nadia Leong. 

Until late August, TGM events was content to hide behind WME Radio, since fans didn't yet know where they should really be turning.

Out of concern for this situation, I created a Twitter account to document and spread the word. 

Yesterday, I found a section of TGM's website dedicated to the Eric Nam tour:

http://tgmevents.com/ericnam

I thought this was an interesting find, so I tweeted: 

https://twitter.com/tgm_events_scam/status/636768980078727168

A few minutes later, I remembered TGM's fondness for deleting posts that contain criticisms or requests that they wish to ignore. So I submitted the site to the Wayback Machine at archive.org, which amateurs may not realize is a true and accurate snapshot of the state at a webpage at a given point in time:

https://twitter.com/tgm_events_scam/status/636769554102796289

Later that night, thought it would be interesting to check if the site was still up. Apparently, TGM staff noticed my Tweets. The page was deleted. So I took another snapshot: 

https://web.archive.org/web/20150827093628/http://www.tgment.com/ericnam

I'll leave a link to the petition on behalf of the victims of TGM Events.

Oh, and I better archive that WME Radio thread for posterity:

And finally, out of support to the aggrieved Kim Tae Woo fans, I'll archive this gem:

1466,2015-8-27,2015,8,27,19,3ikyl4,[Discussion] What about KPop as an industry and its success is rooted in Korean culture or wider Asian culture?,InsufferableCush,1440670662,"First off, feel free to direct me to other discussions that my searches have failed to turn up.

What got me to this topic was this CNN video I watched a while back about these widely successful multi-member idol groups is rooted in Asian collectivism and it got me thinking about JPop acts like AKB48 and some boy bands mentioned in this Youtubers React to Jpop video. I personally like this statement better than the industry is reliving the golden era of US girl and boy groups and is behind global trends. It could also explain why there are label tours like SMTown, YGFamily, and JYPNation. Singers like Beyonce and Katie Perry (who are signed under the same label) would only share the same stage if it was a collaboration or a good cause like charity. 

Possible parallels could be made between the intensity and pressure of the trainee system and the school system. The high level of work ethic expected is a common theme in both worlds, though a case could be made that this just a product of a highly competed industry. Though it's still interesting to see how if your a KPop idol or a regular high school student, you probably are done for the day with classes and study/practice sessions at 10 pm. 

Other phenomenons that are apparent like aegyo and ""flower boys"" always intrigue me and have me wonder what aspect of Korean culture or social norms do they originate from. I have friends who draw comparisons of the ability of a otherwise petty scandal to ruin a well established career, like T-ara, to Chinese social inclinations to save face in public and how shame can be seen as worse than death.

Also, what are your own personal theories and insights into where the ""East"" side of East meets West hails from?

A couple friends of mine are in multiple kpop LINE chats and we wanted to make a master post here to invite more people into these chats. There are several boy and girl group chats and their average size is around ~30. The chats themselves are usually filled with friendly ifans from all over the world. 

Why should you join a group chat? Well I made one because I didnt have anyone else to talk to about kpop outside of reddit or onehallyu. None of my closer friends are interested in kpop and somehow I got a group of really nice people to chat about kpop with. We'll invite anyone to join one or two or all these chats if you're interested :)

If you dont know what [line](http://line.me/en/) is, its basically chat program like skype, kakaotalk, kik, aim, etc. Basically you add the below IDs and message them for which chat you'd like to join. (Like the **infinite** chat.)


**Girl Group Chats (add the ID: gotnob2st)**
-

* 4minute

* AOA

* Apink

* Girls Day

* Lovelyz

* Mamamoo

* Sistar

~~SNSD~~ (LOTS of people asked to join this one, so it's no longer available) 

* Twice

 (There is an f(x) chat, but they aren't accepting people at the moment. If anyone was curious about the lack of f(x))

**Boy Group Chats (add either kennedyperry or gotnob2st)**
-

* BAP

* Block B

* BTS

* IKON

* **Infinite (gotnobs2t REALLY wants you to join this chat. Like now.)**


* Monsta X

* Seventeen

* SHINee (Requires you to be somewhat active or else you get kicked, but well reinvite if you ask.)

**(gotnob2st is also inviting to these)**

* 2PM

* GOT7

* VIXX 


**(kennedyperry is also inviting to these chats)**

* Halo

* Crush

* BTS - Jungkook


If you have any questions I'll answer what I can :D I'll periodically update this when other chats pop up.

Edit: This post ended up being a huge success so thank you guys for joining &lt;3",10,0

^Note: ^The ^respective ^weekly ^charts ^have ^slighty ^different ^cut-off ^times ^\(ichart: ^08/17-08/23, ^Melon: ^08/17-08/23, ^Gaon: ^08/16-08/22)

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of eight major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?serviceGbn=ALL&amp;termGbn=week&amp;hitYear=2015&amp;targetTime=34&amp;nationGbn=K)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",4,16
