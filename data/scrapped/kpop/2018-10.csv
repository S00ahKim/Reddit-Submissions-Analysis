&amp;#x200B;

I've been in the loop behind the scenes of the kpop industry for a while now, and while it has been fun, there are many secrets the public may never know about. I'm coming here anonymously to share a few of those secrets. I will not mention any specific names to avoid too much controversy.

&amp;#x200B;

1. There are 3 main bullies in the girl group shere right now. Two of the three have already been rumored to put on fake personalities on camera, but the third no one would ever guess. 
2. Certain companies have had saseang fans killed for obtaining too much crucial information which, if leaked would ruin the idol, group and company's reputation. This is VERY rare and has only happened, to my knowledge, a couple of times. Saseang fans aren't just obsessive, they have information that could ruin an idol's reputation forever. They hide hidden cameras and microphones in dorms in some cases.
3. There's a LOT of homophobic bullying behind the scenes. 99% of the time it's boy group members attacking other boy group members, sometimes even in the same group. 
4. Staying on the topic of gay idols, SM has a lot of them. 
5. Staying on the topic of gay idols even longer, there's an intergroup relationship between 2 members of a girl group with an alright following. The two of them have been together for a while.
6. A lot of the friendships between idols with large age gaps mean that the older has gone through or is going through a similar situation to the younger. Think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that's all I'm going to spill for now! If you have questions feel free to ask, I'll answer as best as I can.",0,1

11,2018-10-01,2018,10,1,11,9kckmg,My Experience at the K-Expo in NYC,MistakesLikeThis,1538361862,"So, for those that don't know, there was a K-Expo today in NYC that had The Rose, Astro, ACE, and L from Infinite in the lineup. There were also supposed to be various vendors with merch, food, cosmetics, jewelery etc and interactive programs like random dances, a dance workshop, and other things like that. 


So first, the venue was originally supposed to be at Pier 38 in the city, but I had gotten an email at 11:40 last night stating there was a last minute change in venue to the Melrose Ballroom in Queens. I didn't see this email until I had gotten up at 5 in the morning to get ready. So right away, I kind of suspected that things wouldn't go as planned at all. 

I was right. 

My ticket was P1 with The Rose engagement which includes being there for the red carpet event at 10:30am, a group photo, a signed poster and being at the front of the stage for all performances. I got to the line at 8 am to wait (there were separate lines for P1 and P2). 

Since I don't want to make a really long post, I'll try to keep this short with bullet points on what exactly went wrong:

* Everything was disorganized and delayed. We didn't get inside until after 11 and they were still setting up the red carpet. 

* The person speaking to us kept referring the groups as ""our oppas"" and it was so cringy. 

* Since things were delayed, the MC kept trying to stall with talking and it was obviously very awkward.

* the venue was pretty small, so we were all kind of packed in after the red carpet and they let everyone else in. 

* they proceeded to tell us that all exits were final, therefore we could not leave to go outside at all until the end of the event (which was 9pm). They only changed this rule after plenty of complaining, people citing medical reasons and the fact that although it was advertised that there would be vendors with food, there was nothing. It almost felt like a hostage situation. 

* When the performances started, they attempted to organize people by their tier but clearly gave up. So even though I had a P1 ticket, I ended up in the back of the crowd after I left for my engagement with The Rose. 

*Now for the few good things*

*My engagement with The Rose was amazing. I bought a signed album and a different poster. The boys were extremely sweet and tried to interact with everyone. I got to hold Woosung's hand for a few seconds and hug Hajoon, which completely made my night. 

* All the performances we're top notch. I'm not a big fan of Infinite, therefore, also not a big fan of L (not that I dislike their music, just haven't gotten into them much) but he did his first fanmeet here and I may have fallen slightly in love with him. He was hilarious, interacted with the crowd a lot, had people chosen with the lottery method to come on stage for games and he even ended up having to dance in a cute hat to a Red Velvet song. He also gave away a film camera filled with his selfies to one person in the crowd, complete with one last selfie and that person. He also performed a song that will be on his solo album (and it's a whole bop, brace yourselves)

* The Rose, whom I was there for tbh, were absolutely amazing. They performed all their songs (except for Candy which made me a little sad). They answered questions that were asked on Twitter and Jaehyeong said ""Oh shit"" multiple times which was hilarious and Woosung said ""fucking"" casually in a sentence and then acted like he said nothing at all. There were fans called to the stage here too for games and it was really cute. Woosung and Jaehyeong lost and ended up having to dance the sexy version of Baby Shark. 

* ACE and Astro went by pretty fast. For ACE, their dancing was so high energy. I was happy they performed Cactus, but I knew they must've been tired afterwards. I don't know all the members names in this group, but one of them had to do aegyo and kept apologizing afterwards. I thought it was really cute. 

* Astro performed Always You and Crazy Sexy Cool, which were honestly the only two songs they performed I knew. They're so graceful dancing, it was really fluid and i definitely enjoyed it. All the members had to do aegyo as well, but they pulled it off with smiles. 


All in all, the organization was a disaster, but every group was amazing to see live and interact with. It ended at 9:30 and I can say I left happy. I met a lot of nice people and even exchanged numbers with a few, while helping others find their way around since I'm a local. I probably won't go to another expo if done by the same people unless it's a group I really really love and even then I'd think twice. But I also don't regret coming here!",36,1

If I were to audition, this would be my first audition. I've tried inquiring about this but they said only 98s are eligible. Only thing is that I know some idols have lied about their age when auditioning. Honestly, even if I didn't make it, I have really wanted to audition for practice regardless.

&amp;nbsp;

In actuality, one week is **really not enough**, no matter how rushed we are. *I* wasn't even able to get my submissions in, and clearly neither were a lot of yall. The team is confident we'll be able to finish by a Halloween release date anyway (though the video may not be as intense as previous releases), so you have ONE MORE WEEK to sing your heart out. If you rushed to get yours in by today/tomorrow, feel free to take a little more time and submit more takes, no judgement if we get multiple emails from you.

Again, submissions now close 
#MONDAY, OCTOBER 8th

Refresher and most recent release [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9ftuhn/rkpop_sings_%EB%B9%A8%EA%B0%84_%EB%A7%9B_red_velvet_red_flavor/) for anyone who has no idea what's going on.

Submission guidelines and romanization repeated below because I have a feeling clicking through to the other post might be a bit too complicated for us.

#HOW TO RECORD AND SUBMIT YOUR VOCALS

Follow these steps and save us all a lot of pain please. If you already know how to record your voice, skip ahead to step 7.

**Step 1**. Download Audacity (or open Garageband if you're on a Mac.) If you don't have a phone or computer that has a microphone, borrow one. Ask nicely. More specifics on recording with Audacity [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hvurc/project_ranime_sings_colors_by_flow_code_geass_op/?st=j9westlp&amp;sh=fdeb6d0e), via /u/IbrahimT13

**Step 2**. Get some headphones, preferably ones without a mic, and plug them in. We want to hear ONLY YOUR VOICE. If the headphones have a mic, make sure your input in the program is not set to that channel.

**Step 3**. Open the Lucifer music video ([THIS ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dww9UjJ4Dt8)) in your browser.

**Step 4**. Open this page and scroll down to the officially sanctioned pronunciation guide below.

**Step 5.** Put those headphones in your ears, hit record on the software, hit play on the music video, then sing your heart out. Remember that kpop groups are multiple people. It is not possible to sing all of the lines in immediate order without losing breath or doubling up, so do a bunch of takes. If this is confusing, the easiest thing to do for this song is to record each member's part as a separate track. Basically, use common sense: DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF. 

**Step 6**. Lucifer has a ton of intense choral harmonies, so if you're up for it, take a hack at em, though if you do, please record those as a SEPARATE file and include them in the email. Again, DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF. It's alright if you send us 5/6 different audio tracks! 

**Step 7**. Save your masterpieces as a .wav (preferrably in 48kHz), .m4a (preferrably 256kbps or higher), or .flac file and email that sucker to redditkpop101@gmail.com. If your files are too big (happens often) please zip them up and send us a download (via mega/mediafire, whatever) link. We'd REALLY prefer you not share a google drive link, the permissions can get confusing. Several people weren't included on Red Flavor because they never responded to my emails begging them to fix the permissions. Don't be that person.

If you found this stupid and confusing, [here is a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBMhf53SSC8). If you're still stupid and confused, DM me.

As a reminder, no calling dibs on parts, don't be a dick, etc etc. 

------

**Some general recording tips.** (Adapted from /u/IllllllllI's post).

* It is absolutely *mandatory* that you do [this](https://gfycat.com/FarflungTanFlyinglemur) move while you sing that part.

* Try to minimize background noise as much as possible, unless it's funny, and then we'll use it in the credits.

* If you love the idea of this project and want to contribute long-term, consider buying a little standalone USB microphone. I can personally vouch for the quality and durability of [this](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-iCE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B014PYGTUQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517946380&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=USB+microphone&amp;dpID=31Ju5HK-6bL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch) one for basic use. There are cheaper options on amazon now, but I'm not familiar with them. The editing team will thank you (and probably use more of your vocals...just saying...)

* Don't sing too close to your mic - it causes clipping/distortion.

* If you have the resources, consider making a [quick pop filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Ut4s4ME8Y) for your mic. It'll sound a jillion times better and we thank you for it &lt;3.

* Higher notes are easier to sing if you sing confidently/loudly and with good breath support.

* If you have to go screamo or shouty to hit the notes, back away from your microphone please. It's easier to make quiet vocals louder, than louder vocals quieter. (I personally record the majority of my vocal takes from across my apartment).

* You can absolutely include you doing the karate chop sounds.

* if Lucifer is too low/high for you, feel free to sing in either an octave up or down! *Just don't change the key.*

* In general, this is not an easy song to sing, but please don't get discouraged! Take deep breaths, have lots of water on hand, keep your soft pallet raised and try to imagine the sound coming out of the center of your forehead. Remember, *at least it's not Wolf.*

And most importantly, HAVE FUN WITH IT, NERDS.

#PRONUNCIATION GUIDE 

As we know from the survey, not a ton of us are Korean experts (aigoo~). The wonderful /u/jellyfilled_donut took the time to put together a pronunciation guide for us as she is a native speaker and wants us to not butcher the language as much as we could. Please give her tons of love, we would be nowhere without her!!

Here are jelly's guides to the vowel sounds, and below is the guide to Lucifer itself, romanized with emphasized syllables bolded. This is not a super easy song to sing, so give yourself some time with it (I realize the hypocrisy of saying this even though the deadline's much shorter, sorry). Italicized words are English words pronounced traditionally (or as traditionally as you can pronounce ""loverholic"").

Thanks to some amazing work by u/jonicrecis, we now have a calendar of Upcoming Releases in the sidebar of the new Reddit page.  It includes the artist, title, date, time, and release type for the next 10 releases, and [it looks like this.](https://i.imgur.com/EcXwJei.png)  The list updates daily and is populated by scrapping data from our [Upcoming Releases Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/2018/october) which is maintained by the awesome /u/tastetherainbeau and /u/dessidy.  Because this feature is using the new calendar widget, it is **only available on the Reddit redesign.**  If you're not using the redesign as your default, you can view it at any time by browsing to http://new.reddit.com/r/kpop.  If you tried the redesign in the past and didn't like it, we encourage you to give it another chance as it continues to get better.  Make sure you [select Classic Mode](https://i.imgur.com/HzxZqbk.png) for a more familiar look and feel.

We think this new widget is pretty cool we hope you will find it valuable.  What do you think?  We will continue to work hard to make r/kpop the best it can be.  If you have any ideas about things we could add to the subreddit or the sidebar, let us know in the comments or [send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop)  Keep being awesome and have fun loving K-Pop!",22,1

My best friend told me this was a good place to ask for some recomendations so here I am! I've been listening to k-pop for only two weeks so, I really don't know a lot of singers/groups. She introduced me to BTS and BlackPink and some other random songs from the groups G-Friend, Red Velvet, SHINee and NCT.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are songs that are like a **must** in k-pop (which are easy to find with some googling) but I want to ask you if you could tell me 3 songs I should take a look at, or the 3 you consider your all time favorites. Not only title tracks (they are welcome too!) but I want to find some good gems not that easy to find or listen if you are not familiar with this genre. I'll make a Spotify list after your recommendations to help me find new music to listen to! I'm open to everything :)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot!! I'm sure a lot of people have done this kind of post in the past, hope this doesn't bother anyone.",2,1

I  for example started as a very young kid with hard rock and metal. To  this day Slipknot's ''Three Nil'' is probably the song i listened to the most in my entire life. With the time I discovered basically all  genres, but I'm a Once since ''Cheer-Up'' and since then I'm totally  digging K-Pop as a whole, even all those Lo-fi \~ish artists like  offonoff and smaller ones you can only find on SoundCloud and even  rather old ones like EPIK HIGH or JYP himself.

I'm  asking because it just took all of a sudden a rather big space in my  life, and when i showed some K-Pop to my friend, who exclusively  listened to Metal and House, he firstly neglected it (just as i did at  first) but two weeks later he suddenly tells me about TWICE, BTS,  Blackpink etc.. What we really like about it is, well... the gurlz look  good aayyy, BUT the songs are catchy and simply colorful compared to what is mostly around which is simple mumble rap.

So I'm wondering if there are people with similar stories here

In short wanted to create a *different* summer song that suited to their image (in a previous interview she said Shuhua's cold aura was her muse). She says she was inspired by an old korean poem - [Azalea, by Kim Sowol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Sowol) - that expressed feelings of ""regret, sorrow, resentment, guilt, rancor, etc..."", and she uses the word ""HANN"" (which has no english equivalent) to define the sum feeling of all those emotions. The poem is really interesting, and the origin of HANN makes a lot more sense now.

There's also a bunch of other literary devices and stylistic choices she uses in the song that are apparently very old, but I can't explain since I'm not korean/don't speak the language. It'd be great if someone could help ~~since the group specific sub is somewhat dead~~. The subtitles on the video linked above have a brief explanation ^or ^^just ^^^listen ^^^^to ^^^^^the ^^^^^^lyrics...

This also reminded me of when I started becoming a fan of BTS, it was around when Spring Day released and theories about the Sewol Ferry incident and references to a novel called Omelas (which I've yet to read) were flying around. I ended up getting bits and pieces of different theories and it just confused me even more, but it was really cool that they were able to encapsulate all of these ideas in their music and lyrics.

What are your favorite instances of a group (or soloist) really letting their creativity and ideas shine through their work? It doesn't have to be limited to history or old literature ~~it could be a song inspired by Spongebob~~.",58,1

In about a month, i will be finishing off my last highschool exams and i am thinking of going to train at YG's new academy for vocal lessons. ([http://ygx.co.kr/en/about/x-academy/?ckattempt=3](http://ygx.co.kr/en/about/x-academy/?ckattempt=3)) I am debating to go for the one month course (4 lessons) or 3 month professional course (24 lessons). Growing up, being a singer has always been my dream, and ive always wanted to train in korea. Being still underage, it's quite risky staying alone in korea, not knowing the language (I'm Chinese!) for 3 months.  However, personally I really want to go, improve and audition. PLEASE TALK SOME SENSE INTO ME hahaha.

Please tell me your opinion on whether i should go or not!

184,2018-10-03,2018,10,3,11,9kx96n,"Hong Kong Youth Concert with BTOB, CLC, Pentagon, and Lee Gikwang",unicornbottle,1538534594,"I attended the HK Youth Concert in celebration of China's National Day. They have this event every year, but this is the first time they've invited so many CUBE idols, so I jumped at the opportunity. Because this event is heavily sponsored by the government and a whole two pages' worth of donors, the tickets were only $150, or $200 if you sat closer to the stage. Yes, you read that right ladies and gentlemen, my tickets were under **$20 USD.** The tickets were apparently only $50 HKD/~$7 USD the first year they organized this. My seat was up in the nosebleeds, but fortunately I was facing the stage, so I had a nice complete view of the stage and the large screens. 

1. **CLC.** They opened the show with Hobgoblin, and the stadium enthusiastically cheered whenever Elkie was shown on the screen. The home crowd gotta support one of our own. She also led the ment and translated everything the members said into Cantonese (and she was lowkey better than the official translators the other idols had lol). They followed up with Meow Meow and I Like It, before ending with Black Dress. It was plainly obvious that 98% of the audience was there for Gikwang or BTOB, but there were a smattering of Cheshires here and there. No one really knew the 2nd and 3rd songs (except Cheshires), but everyone screamed when *dun dun dun dun dun ~Black~* started. Yeeun was the next most popular after Elkie, and she had a lot of charisma onstage. 

2. Next up was local singer/actor **Sammy Sum**. He sang a few Cantonese songs and one Mandarin song, and people started swaying their lightsticks along to the music (a very Cantopop concert/karaoke moment). He sang very well!  

3. **Boy Story.** They are the super young Chinese boy group that is produced by JYP. The crowd had a ""lol wat"" moment when the MCs revealed that their average age was 13. Hardly anyone in the crowd knew them and they received pretty lukewarm responses at first, but it got a lot more lively by the end of their performance. I don't know their songs, but they are all great dancers and their choreography is very high-energy; I felt slightly exhausted on their behalf. Half of the group's voices haven't even changed yet. There's also this one kid who is very good-looking, and everyone did a collective ""oh~"" when the camera zoomed into his face during their introductions. 

4. **Kandy Wong.** Another local singer. She was super cute and lively, and has an incredible voice. She sang a few Cantonese songs as well as a cover of  A Little Happiness by Hebe Tien. 

5.  **Pentagon.** The next three performers were what everyone had been waiting for. They started off with Naughty Boy and Pretty Pretty, and did a lot of cute fanservice (waving, hugging each other, doing cute faces) during the latter. The ment was pretty short. There was a funny moment when Hui was about to talk but the audience cheered when his face was shown on the giant screen. Hui did this ""WTF?!"" face for a second and then burst out laughing. Wooseok was also surprisingly popular (and really tall, he was like a dancing chopstick). They then performed Gorilla, which was unexpected. I don't think they've done the Korean version of Gorilla in a while? Wooseok took over Edawn's lines there too. There was a male Universe near me and he hollered out the fanchants to every song. Pentagon ended with Shine, and literally the entire stadium sang along to JIJIRI JIJIRI. Truly the song that unites fandoms. 

6. **Lee Gikwang** Beast and Highlight were/are huge here, so a good half of the audience were Lights. I'm not familiar with Gikwang's solo work, but it featured a lot of RnB and trop pop. His dancing was very fluid, and all the Lights were screaming ""LEE GIKWANG LEE GIKWANG LEE GIKWANG"" during his dance break. He also did a longer ment and talked about the projects he was working on. I think he forgot his script halfway because he kind of repeated what he said twice. 

6. **BTOB** - before BTOB came to perform, I figured that the audience was maybe 50% Melodies. Once they announced BTOB though, literally the whole stadium became awash with blue lightsticks. No kidding, the entire lower level rushed out of their seats and went near the stage with slogans and lightsticks (there's this fence separating the stage area and the seats). I was like ""where did all these Melodies even come from?!!"" 

The setlist was Missing You, The Feeling, Movie, and Only One For Me. Being able to sing the fanchants along side all the Melodies was pretty unforgettable. Melodies were on point with the fanchants. People are right, BTOB's live vocals are something to be experienced. They honestly sound even better live and they were insane live performers. Ilhoon is officially part of the vocal line too; he served us vocals during The Feeling. 

Sungjae was easily the most popular, and the next were Ilhoon and Minhyuk. We are blessed to experience peak Jung Ilhoon visuals, everyone. He's also such a natural talent when it comes to talking. He led the ments and was very interactive and natural with the crowd. BTOB also had all of us say ""Ilhoon happy birthday!"" since it's his birthday tomorrow. Sungjae's (lack of) Mandarin-speaking ability is infamous even among non-fans, and he completely blanked out on what he was gonna say and stood silent for a good ten seconds while Hyunsik tried to tell him. But he did give us a [""DA JIA HAO WO SHI LU XING CAI!!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKoKlGt5eSA). Also Ilhoon and Sungjae ended up bickering or something on stage lmao. Anyways, it was funny seeing them go from emotional heartfelt vocals to neighborhood comedians BTOB. I knew this already but Changsub is super pale IRL, even from the back I could see that he was a few shades lighter than the other guys. 

Final thoughts: I'm glad I went, it was a fun experience overall. I went alone, but being able to see four Kpop artists for the price of a dinner and drinks was definitely worth it. One thing I underestimated was how loud the concert would be. When CLC was performing I could genuinely feel my heart vibrating along with the bass. The crowd was mostly young people, but there were a few middle-aged men and women there too. ",18,1

They said stuff like new hair, new songs, and J-Hope accidentally said new member. He meant a new side to the members but it got me thinking what would happen if they actually introduced a new member. It would be so awkward as they've known each other for 5+ years. They have great chemistry, to have someone new come in would make the dynamic all off. I'd still be a fan and consume the content but it would be something I'd always notice.

The same person has Justin Bieber as her background.

I'll leave the original message below, so if anybody recognizes the song, it would blow my mind to actually find it as I lost any faith. Thanks!

""I'm currently going mad trying to figure out what the background song from this clip after the singer's performance is. I tried shazam, I can't understand the lyrics but I tried some of that anyway but no luck. 

The song sounds so familiar, but I think it's just because I've been listening to it for so long so any lead is welcomed.

[this](https://incorrectexidquotes.tumblr.com/post/173774934846/irene-all-of-the-girls-snacks-are) tumblr post also makes me wonder how solji and irene would handle leading each other's groups - there isn't much of an age gap between them, either. it'd be like a battle between the maknae lines ;;; but i feel like the rv girls would see solji as a cool aunt.

also, obligatory nct mention. i'd love to see a leader of a smaller group try to manage nct; 127 on their own are quite well behaved, but all eighteen of them together can be so messy ~ they're probably the second reason why taeyong is going to lose his hair.

During the bloodbath that was ticketing, I ended up with a GA ticket.  I was really apprehensive about it at the time but I thought that I might as well give GA a shot.  Before the concert, I read up on anything I could find about being in GA, so I thought that Id add my experience to the mix.

I arrived in Newark on Thursday and decided that I wanted to try camping out Friday Night since I was really nervous about not being able to see (I'm 4'11).  I rented out camping gear (tent, tarp, sleeping bags, ground pads, camping chairs) through my college for the weekend.

Note: I knew people that had planned on buying camping equipment in Newark.  Id be cautious doing that  all the nearby stores were sold out of tents!

I got in line around 8am on Friday, and there were [~230 people in queue](https://imgur.com/ACmo3h9) when I got in line.  There were separate queues for Friday and Saturdays shows, and the one for Saturday was unofficial and so a lot of us were worried about if the Prudential Center would honor it or if there would just be a mad rush to get to the front of the line.  They did honor the unofficial line, fortunately!

People always give the advice to become friends with the people next to you in line, and I can confirm that you really really should!  The people next to me helped me carry my supplies when the line moved, and would watch my stuff when I needed a break or wanted to get something.

Lots of fans were giving out [freebies/fan project goods](https://imgur.com/a/Kl6HrQq) or were selling goods, including [pins, art prints and stickers!](https://imgur.com/a/r7OPDtL)  I kept an eye on the #BTSinNewark hashtag on twitter sorted by new while waiting in line to keep updated with what was going on.

There were lots of fansites who were [selling banners](https://imgur.com/a/IRd08uE) there as well  majorscale_kr,  hopesmiling0218, madein1997_jk, jinkiss, winterstrawverry, lookatmin1013, and jinkissletsgo are the ones I can remember.  I turned twitter notifications on to get info about when they got to the venue and where they were going to sell their slogans.

If you are camping out, an external phone power bank is critical!!  I borrowed [several](https://imgur.com/mr8I7xS) from my friends because I am a paranoid person.  I definitely had more than I needed but it was better to have too many than too few, so no regrets.

Sitting in line was pretty uneventful.  I had a book and a deck of cards (plus the internet of course) and all was good.  There were a couple reporters who talked to me in line, which was cool.  Some street vendors were selling [unofficial BTS concert shirts](https://imgur.com/BUAReSz) for $20 (cheaper if you bargained).

Some of the people ahead of me in line who had camped from Tuesday called ticketmaster and found out that their tickets were a scam :(  Fortunately they were able to find new GA tickets on Saturday morning, but I was sooo stressed for them the entire time :(

I was also really stressed about the line moving to the side of the Prudential Center after Fridays GA line moved inside.  At one point, there was a rush from the people in the back of the line and I just about had a heart attack since none of my stuff was packed up.  Fortunately they were sent back, but I never fully relaxed after that scare.  The Prudential Center staff honored the unofficial line and was AMAZING about moving the line and made sure everything was orderly, if a bit slow haha.

I only saw one group of people that straight up cut the line, but they went to the back after they were called out for it.  The issue was more with people who had friends that were already in line, which is a bit of a grey area.  Nobody likes it but theres not much you can do about it.

Sleeping wasnt too bad, I plugged in my headphones and was able to get a solid 7 hours of sleep.  The Prudential Center staff wanted all tents to be gone by 8am, and people were pretty good about that.  

At ten, we started getting our numbered wristbands, and my official place was in the 250s.  The line behind me had [grown exponentially overnight](https://imgur.com/Aj6CZsM)!! (video)

After getting the wristband, I was free at last from the queue!  I went to a friends place to shower and eat and prepare myself.  After a couple of hours I returned to the venue.  Everyone lined up according to the wristband order.

By the time I entered the venue, there were already 3-4 rows of people surrounding the extended stage, so I went instead for a [barricade spot on the catwalk](https://imgur.com/a/cRTAUSu)!  The spot was right by the catwalk's [side entrance](https://imgur.com/gallery/hXQZlyK).  Biggest shock of my life was when I looked over and Yoongi popped out from the entrance and was like, right there, two feet away from me.  The boys only used that exit twice to get on stage, but staff members and backup dancers used it throughout the show.

There were a couple staff members filming in the space between the barrier and the stage!  [One of them (on the right of this pic)](https://imgur.com/gallery/KUwRleE) was filming the [GCF uploaded yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zly9g6m6dkU) which was so freaking cool to watch.

After getting the spot, there was still an hour and a half before the concert began, so people around me squatted down in our spots for the time being.  They played a bunch of BTS MVs during the wait and everyone practiced the fanchants.

The concert itself was absolutely phenomenal, as expected!  It was insane being able to actually see them perform with my own eyes.  The boys walked up and down the catwalk several times and I just about died every time.  Tae sprayed me with water which was awesome!  Hobi was amazingggg with the fanservice, he even [filmed a selfie](https://twitter.com/sleykaloiseau/status/1046226843676938241) with the phone of a girl a couple spots away from me.  We all screamed when we saw the video was blurry :((( 

So, before the concert, my three main worries about being in GA was:

1. Being crushed against the barricade 
2. Not being able to see 
3. The noise

For concern 1, I was lucky in that my section wasnt really pushy!  Side to side it was like sardines, especially in the second half, but I wasnt ever pushed against the barricade.  I had a friend at the front of the extended stage who said it was really bad for her though, and she was really sore the next day from the pushing.  The people behind her were even pinching her to try and get her to move :(

For concern 2, my spot ended up being absolutely perfect!  Because I was at the barricade of the catwalk, I had a unblocked view of both the [main stage](https://imgur.com/gallery/iguQi4o) and the [extended stage](https://imgur.com/gallery/PxfA5VZ) (though I was seeing the extended stage performances from the back).  Not to mention all the times they [walked the catwalk](https://imgur.com/gallery/XHONfOX) and were like, right there.

For concern 3, I had splurged and bought a pair of concert earplugs and wore them throughout the concert.  They were absolutely perfect, I was able to enjoy the concert and the music to the fullest without fear of hearing damage, haha.

So long story short  My GA experience was incredible and amazing and I will remember it for the rest of my life.  Personally, I dont think Ill want to do GA again because of the stress of camping out and getting a good spot, though it super payed off for me.  It was so amazing getting to see BTS perform up close!!!

Because of this, I've added several Japanese versions to my overall Kpop playlist, and I have to admit, some translated versions are just as good or even better sounding than their Korean version. For instance, Beast's Shock sounds great in Japanese, and now I can't hear the Korean version of SHINee's Juliette without thinking it sounds off because I'm so used to the Japanese version.

So I was listening to the [Japanese version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGXtvout49M) of [SF9's Now or Never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8MFfg3DHA) and I was generally curious about fellow redditors opinions on this subject. Personally, I love the Japanese audio of NoN more than the original version HOWEVER I still prefer the music video visuals of the Korean version more than the Japanese version. There's a few other songs I feel like this with but there are others where I generally like both and others where its vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/k9tvjxucoaq11.jpg

On a different note, I love the music video visuals for the [Japanese version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OX7dIRReSA) of [BTS's Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmE9f-TEutc) more than the Korean counterpart but I love the Korean audio more than the Japanese recording. 

Regardless, I will still love the different language versions that groups make (i.e GOT7's Lullaby in Spanish was my fave and EXO's Lucky One in Chinese) but I'm curious, who else feels like they preferred a kpop song in a different language than its original recording? Could be music video, audio, visuals, etc. of any song including title tracks and b-sides.

378,2018-10-05,2018,10,5,13,9lj970,181004 VIP EXPERIENCE CTYL TORONTO TOUR 2018,OG_etherealbangtan,1538714461,"**There is Coming to You Live Tour 2018, Toronto, at Opera House  in October 4, 2018 and the lineup included Christian Yu (Rome), Hong Dabin (DPR LIVE), and the rest of the crew** (still trying to familiarize myself). There was no merchandise sale (it's online) and since I got the VIP MEET AND GREET TICKET. Apparently (I had to come get a VIP ID from the guard in front), and line up. There are three separate lines for VIP, EE (Early Entrance) and GA (General Admission). I got to the venue in 4:27 pm, the assigned time was 5:00 pm. While, I was standing, don't be afraid to start with a conversation with people (Trust me, waiting in the line for 40 minutes is too boring). I had some conversation with people who went to BTS concert in Hamilton (It was my first concert) and engaged with them on how many concerts they went to, what was their favourite and etc,

&amp;#x200B;

***WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THE VENUE***

* Lineup took a delay of 10-20 minutes for VIP but I was happy that the line started moving already. In the entrance, you will be asked to throw away all of the water bottles and they will check your bags (The faculty is not too stringent about what's inside the bag).We were asked that bag's weren't allowed so we had to pay for storage which is $4 CAD. They only accept cash for drinks and everything.

&amp;#x200B;

* We were separated into six people in one group for photo time and I can't stress this enough. Make sure you are in the line with your friends or someone that is comfortable with you when taking a picture with DPR LIVE for VIP. I was excited at first so I downloaded the photo from facebook through  the host of the event which is KOHAI. I uploaded it to every social media I have and was asked for it to be taken down by the people who was in it. (I mean it's already posted publicly in facebook and they want their faces covered when I uploaded to instagram). So I did, what I was asked to do and put a big ass circle on their faces. TLDR: Make sure get a group for six people that you are friends with during the line so there are no conflicts that occurs

&amp;#x200B;

* When it was my turn for the picture, I couldn't believe that my favourite artist I listed to is just literally within a meter away. Everything was so surreal and still feels fake but It was a spiritual feeling and it was amazing.I shook Hong Dabin's hand cause I thought it would be awkward but he went for the hug (fanboy feels triggered). I literally hug him so tight asdfghjkl like my life depended on it and it was an amazing feeling tbh. An artist that you respect so much and the fact is that I can't believe I could finally meet them 

&amp;#x200B;

* After the photo, the meet and greet happened in 10-30 minutes with the DPR crew. They were asked 20 random questions by fans who send in FB. Most of the questions goes with the flow like: What is his inspiration for music? What is the vibes of Toronto? What is your favourite place to visit? Tbh the most memorable one was a fan asking ""If you ruled the world, what would be your first law?"" They were all shook bc apparently it's a really unique question lol. Christian said ""I would make cheeseburgers free"" then the audience went wild with the awww. After that, Hong Dabin said ""He would make people smile and not frown"" and I think it was DPR Ram (KUNTS) (correct me on this) who said that isn't that communism ( tbh he is a savage).

&amp;#x200B;

* After the meet and greet, early entrance people started coming in. My advice to you is stay in your position bc it's hard to go back at this time and make sure you are with your friends. The venue was really hot and small so I bought water for $4. For the 19+ they were scanned before to whoever showed their I.D. They had the option to go to the top row where they can drink alcohol. It was a pretty good view. General Admission (late people) start coming in and had to stay in second floor. Tbh, I was pushed around my spot and early entry people stole my spot but tbh I didn't mind since I was kinda tall and could see everything.

***DURING THE PERFORMANCE***

* Everyone went wild, there was a DJ that played first in 40-50 minutes and everyone was so hype with the Korean songs but not on the English songs. (Tbh I didn't really know some titles that played)

&amp;#x200B;

* DPR performed in 8:00-ish and did an intro song with Know me by Dean Collaboration (fancam). Tbh when he performed it is like he is eating the cd literally. With all the jumping he did, he is so damn energetic and hyped up the crowd. There was no dead silence tbh. Also, his voice and visuals are beautiful in real life and the fact is he is ethereal, an angel.

&amp;#x200B;

* His music has the r and b groove that really captures my attention tbh and can't get bored of listening. He is such a good performer and p.s. they threw like 10 water bottles to the fans. Tbh, I really needed it not bc im a thot but the fact is the venue was so hot it was such a blessing to be a part of DPR water.

&amp;#x200B;

* Christian was recording and in the end, he danced with Hong Dabin. He took a break in the middle-end where he thanks his fans. (Tbh you can see it in his eyes and the way he performs that he cares for every fans). I told him during meet and greet (photo time) that I loved him and his music and he said Thanks man TT 

&amp;#x200B;

* They had an encore with Jasmine Blue and a guy before in VIP q and a session an origami to hold up during Jasmine Blue Performance (he almost made 100). Literally bless your soul and efforts. Make sure to stop recording too much and just appreciate it live. Tbh it cannot be compared, his performance and visuals in real life is much more amazing.

***OVERALL***

* It was a really good concert to be honest with the fact that DPR crew were just really engaging and entertaining. During the end, they were taking phone fans to take selfies which is a pure blessing tbh. Also during the greet and meet, I did the normal hand heart, finger heart, and normal hand heart to Christian and he followed the same pattern. asdghkl we had eye contact and he notice me. Its unreal.

&amp;#x200B;

* The fact is DPR crew are such great performers and their music is amazing. 4k Fancam will be posted soon in the edit.

&amp;#x200B;

* If you would like to ask more questions, I will be ready and happy to answer it :)",4,1

With that said I have been wondering why you as an individual likes kpop. Either why do you like/follow a specific band or why do you follow the genre as a whole?

For an even more specific question I want to ask to non-korean speakers, that is those of you that follow kpop but do not speak or understand the language. 
Why do you listen to it? In particular what about the bands/genre appeal to you?
Again, no offence is meant by this and it has been a genuine growing curiosity of mine as I have seen the genre as a whole rise to prominence in western and American culture",5,1

In this thread, share your favorite fancams from this past week or      other **recent events**.  You can post group cams or individual member cams.  Cams from concerts, music shows, even radio and variety are okay!  Post as many as you want, and if you post several from the same event, group them together for us.

According to the census results, at least 1,400 of you (who were willing to sign in for the census) are viewing our subreddit with the **Old Reddit design**. There are probably many more. We'd like to keep those banner images fresh for you.

For those of you using the **New Reddit Redesign**, we have good ol' PSY greeting you.  Our moderator team has expressed our wishes to the reddit powers that be to have rotating banners integrated into the Redesign, but we can't be certain that will ever come to pass. We might be able to work around that through code in the future, but in the meantime, what would you like to see as the banner on the Redesign?

**A.** [PSY FOREVER!!!](https://i.imgur.com/icemB03.jpg)  

**B.** Changed once per week to an image from the top upvoted music video that week.  

**C.** Changed once per month to a composite image of the top 5(?) upvoted music videos that month. Examples from September: [ONE](https://i.imgur.com/2klTk65.jpg) and [TWO](https://i.imgur.com/Znd7iBW.jpg)

**D.** Any other ideas?

***
Okay, back to Old Reddit, let's get those new banners coming in!
A new banner shows each time you refresh the subreddit. We have space for roughly 30 banners to be in continuous rotation at any given time. We'll take as many as you guys can come up with and they will be added gradually into the rotation over the next three to four months.

**How to participate!**

A. Make a banner with the following considerations: 

* Ideal dimensions: **1920px wide** by **223px tall** (minimum height)
* Hitting that 1920px width is more important than the height. I can help adjust or crop your banner to our exact needs.
* We prefer using shots from music videos that *don't* include people or recognizable faces. We get the most positive feedback for the headers with bright colors, interesting set designs, or iconic scenes.
* What **NOT** to submit: Group shots of idols standing around: [[1](http://i.imgur.com/yVly5ew.jpg)], [[2](http://i.imgur.com/h6yYqG9.jpg)], [[3](http://i.imgur.com/K5uUPET.jpg)].
* Use our [Master List](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/headerimages) (linked in the sidebar at the bottom of Features) for inspiration and reference. Please check to make sure we have not already made a banner from the same shot as the one you wish to submit.
* We would prefer imagery from recent music videos (within the last few months), but you are welcome to choose something older. Keep in mind the quality of much older videos won't look as crisp as newer videos. Again use the Master List for reference.

B. Suggest a music video you think would make a great header

* Provide a screenshot or link with an exact timestamp to the relevant image. Remember the dimensions are very long and narrow. Something that looks great in a full screenshot may look very strange when it has been cropped.
* We can create the banner for you if it looks promising and you will be credited in the Master List. (I will peruse comments and help do this, but others are also welcome to help out their fellow redditors if you think they have a good idea.  Helpers may also be credited for putting that work in.)

C. Comment, upvote, and give feedback!

* Do you like a banner someone submitted? Show your support with upvotes and compliments.
* Is there a banner we already have in rotation you want us to keep?
* Is there a banner we have in rotation you can't stand? (Be respectful to the user who created it, please!)

**AT ANY TIME**  /r/kpop users are welcome to PM me with their headers. Instructions and a link to message me are provided at the bottom of the [Master List](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/headerimages). Or you can save up your banners for the next time the Banner Bonanza comes around!

She can belt out, she was the main vocalist for 2NE1 as her voice stood out (and when your partners are CL, Sandara Park and Mimzy, it is an incredible achievement). Few have as distinctive a voice as she has yet she's constantly scrutinized for her technique. 

I also get annoyed at how Soyou from Sistar is criticized for the sound of her voice, she's always accused of whispering, yet it is the tenderness of her voice which gives her the distinctive sound. Not every singer needs to be on the same level as Sohyang or sound the same as Ailee. A ""quieter"" singing voice doesn't mean the singer can't sing. I think Soyou is amazing.",214,1

I am a 19 year old Korean who has never been exposed to K-pop all my life. I recently tried to connect back to my roots through pop culture but the more I try, the more I am pushed away by ignorant consumers of Korean media. Maybe I have too high of expectations for pop culture addicts but these people tend to down right refuse to do any research of Korea or get their information outside of Allkpop or Koreaboo if you want to call these two tragedies ""journalism"". This often leads to petty generalizations and even down right racist remarks about Korea. Even on politically sensitive articles, the top comments seem to be telling Koreans to get over Japan's oppression etc. I guarantee these people are the same people that go nuts when some K-pop idols does black face.

Are K-pop fans really this naive? Or do they just hate Koreans; from Koreans online to the Korean members on Produce48. They rather love Sakura, a former member of a alt right Japanese idol group. ",14,0

Wether it was just for fun or actual fan speculation. And what was the eventual reality? 

SVTs Lilli Yabbay which had people speculating so wildly : someone even said Yabbay meant day(?) or so in hausa - me being a Nigerian with exposure to the Hausa language I really couldn't help but laugh tbh. The reality: Lilli Yabbay was just what their dance teacher used to count steps instead of the normal ""one, two, three.""


For a much wilder theory from me:
I formerly posted something in the NCT teaser thread but I too it down, so I'll recap here. 

To sum Regular dream up : Taeil - the very unbothered and succesful CEO of a firm who half his employees secretly dislike. Jaehyun - a very ambitious aces of the firm. Haechan was the boss' nephew and Doyoung was Taeil's longtime secretary who secretly hated him. Winwin was just working to support himself and live life, he didn't really care about the office. 

Then...the workers received an order to overthrow the current CEO....its from one of them but no one knows who...

Taeyong, stressed, took off his glasses. Jaehyun, contemplating, massages his head. Mark, about to eat dinner, takes off his watch. Johnny, all up for it, begins to draw up a plan. Winwin is unsure about the whole thing. Yuta is also up for it and crosschecks Johnnys plan of action. Jungwoo pricesses the plan as he reads it. Haechan catches wind of the plan on the phone but says nothing about it and Taeil side eyes the office, suspecting something is wrong. 

In irregular teaser : the plan was a success, and k-drama style, CEO Taeil flees the country. Jaehyun tosses his worries away, the plan having been a succes, though what role Taeyong's gun played in it, we'll never know. Johnny celebrates the dismissal of the old boss with sparkling water while Yuta finally goes on the vacation he's been dreamin of. Haechan watches all this happening while munching on popcorn and updating his family via groupchat as to what's happening. Doyoung is finally rid of the boss he's always hated and celebrates quietly. Mark, is still eating his ice cream. Once more the office receives a message to meet up in the room with the safe. It's time for the orchestrator to reveal himself. 

At timestamp 2:02 : Enter, Jungwoo, the final boss, who proceeds to hand out the contents of the safe. Yuta looks at the wad of cash and thinks back to a time when he could only find love but not money. Winwin stares blankly, visualizing Taeil beside Haechan as he feels a bit guilty. Haechan feels no guilt as he counts his cash. And Taeyong scrutinizes the diamond he got in exchange for his firearm skills, checking to see if its real or not. 

TL;DR - CEO Taeil was overthrown by the secret plans of final boss Jungwoo.

KARD - Im lucky enough to always get my bias Somin in all their albums.

Coming from the land of Carats it was a bit awakening I guess. (That doesn't mean there's no thirst in Carats either fellow Caratzens, you get me?).

---

Here are my picks:

**2PM's Chansung** - [**Perfume**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLJglADSY7g) 

It's absolutely amazing, he does this beautiful and emotional modern dance in the beginning before staggering up to the mic to sing an amazing song and I think this performance really is so impactful on me because it really made me realise how far Chansung had come with his singing. He isn't the best by any means but how he sounds here honestly showed how much hard work he truly put in to better himself as an artist and he still continues to.

**GOT7's Jinyoung and BamBam** - [**King**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxzg1ApIxgQ)

I love the stage design and costumes and despite it's simplicity it hits pretty well! Although, this is cheating a little bit since they performed it at [KCON-Thailand](https://youtu.be/bGINDzzRtdE?t=40) (the first stage of the video) allowing us to appreciate it in all its glory and not in shaky obscured bad audio videos! ^We're ^never ^going ^to ^get ^the ^studio ^version ^though 

**2PM's Chansung and Junho** - [**Versus**](https://youtu.be/EQAFTd4Mn9s?t=102)

Everything from the VCR (which I skipped a majority of in the link with a timestamp because it's quite lengthy but I recommend you go back and look at it) to the dance to the song, everything is perfect with this stage.

**GOT7** - [**Beggin' On My Knees**](https://youtu.be/8AlXh1Sk88w?t=44) (sorry for the quality but this was like the only video that showcased all the members)

Ever since I first heard this song I've been dying to have the boys actually perform it and they delivered on their 'Eyes On You' tour and it was amazing, I can't wait for the DVD to come out so there will hopefully be a proper video of all the members on screen since a lot of the videos for this stage are member focused.",26,1

I'm one of those people who has no problem explaining why I love K-Pop, should the topic comes up, and I can do it with a sense of authority and confidence, and I can be very convincing at it, so the people I explain it to will either understand and become convinced, or at least grudgingly accept the points I've explained. But I'm able to do this because I'm a professional composer/songwriter, writer/director, artist, and photographer who worked in film/television, animation, video games, comic books, wrote songs for mega pop-stars in C-Pop, composed music for film and games, and I also teach those subjects too, so I can speak about art and entertainment with a high level of insight.

So today, I'm going to try and help my fellow K-Pop fans who might not have the knowledge and experience I have, so that you can also talk about K-Pop to others in a way that is very convincing, so they will walk away from the conversation with a much better understanding of why K-Pop deserves the love it's getting from the global fandom, and why it's perfectly understandable why anyone can be a fan of K-Pop regardless of sex, age, or culture. 

I'll list the main points one-by-one below:

1) K-Pop is the current torch-bearer of the long lost art of sophisticated musical composition and arrangement in pop songwriting that made western pop music a dominant force in the world in the past. As the popularity of hip-hop/rap rose in the west, the stripped down musicality of that style took over western pop music, and we no longer have songs that have complex and sophisticated harmonic structure and progression, melodic contour and scales, rich and full instrumentation arrangements, adventurous and bold in genre blending experimentation (often utilizing classical, jazz, pop, hip-hop, rock, metal, progressive, electronic, R&amp;B, folk, reggae, indie, ethnic, etc. K-Pop is not a genre--it is simply Korean pop music, which contains many different genres of music.). Around the late 90's was when the decline of musicality in western pop music started, and it's been more than a decade since we've had a higher level of musicality in western pop music. Coincidentally, it was also around that time when K-Pop started to rise, and all the qualities that were lost in western pop music were thriving in K-Pop, and as the result, K-Pop is currently the most sophisticated, complex, and adventurous pop music in the world (except maybe J-Pop, but J-Pop has declined a lot musically since their heyday during the 80's) . You can quickly audition a variety of K-Pop songs and hear just how much more complex and sophisticated the chord structures/progressions and melodic contours are, with lots of surprising use of unusual and advanced harmonic movements, unexpected key modulations, blending of diverse musical genres in the same song, clever and interesting use of instrumentation, complex arrangements, unexpected rhythmic shifts, etc. There are many western songwriters and producers writing songs for K-Pop because they love being able to use more advanced musicality when writing for K-Pop, since the western market doesn't accept that level of sophistication and complexity anymore, and the only way they get to flex those musical muscles is in the K-Pop market. 

2) K-Pop is also the current torch-bearer of the long-lost art of combining high level of singing and dancing in performances. Current western pop music no longer has amazing performances in the style of pop icons like Michael Jackson, where imaginative and artful choreography is performed at a high level by the singer during music videos and live performances. In contrast, high level of choreography is one of the most distinctive elements of K-Pop, and you will find endless examples of very creative and entertaining choreography in their music videos and live performances, especially when groups with many members perform the choreography with breathtaking synchronicity and precision, utilizing constantly shifting formations, all while singing live too. K-Pop is the currently the best at it in the world, and they would make Michael Jackson proud. 

3) K-Pop is again, the current torch-bearer of the long-lost art of amazing music videos that used to popular in western pop music. After the decline of MTV, western pop music stopped being putting nearly as much effort into their music videos as they once did. But the music video is another critical element of the K-Pop experience, and the creativity and production quality of K-Pop music videos are the highest in the world right now. The set design, fashion and styling, usage of colors, lighting, cinematography, editing, are all top-notch. 

4) K-Pop is every bit as creative as western pop, and don't let people tell you it's ""not real music,"" or ""it's soulless,"" just because there are teams of songwriters and producers working on the songs. Western pop is no different--if you look at the songwriting/production credits in most western musical artists/groups songs, you'll see they also have songs that were not written or produced by the artist/group. And there ARE K-Pop artists/groups who do write and produce their own songs, and can play instruments at a high level. The emphasis of K-Pop is more on a collaborative effort between professional songwriters/producers and the artists/groups, and what we care about is the final result. Is the song any good? Are the composition and arrangement and singing musically satisfying? If yes, then it's a good song, period. Why should the talent and skill and creative efforts of professional songwriters and arrangers and producers be less respected than the same efforts by the artist or group members? In fact, they are often better at it than the artists and groups because they do it all day long, every day, for many years professionally, and are high level experts at it, without the distraction of having to also learn to dance and act and model and be all-around entertainers. I'd much rather have songs written/produced by experts who do the best job at it, than by artists/groups who might not be as good at it. Let the experts create the songs and the artists/groups perform them--that's a really good way to collaborate and ensure the best results. If we can watch actors who perform in movies and TV shows and admire them for their ability to make us feel all sorts of strong emotions with their acting skills, even if they didn't write the screenplays, then it's the same thing when we can love songs not written by the artists/groups, but were performed beautifully by them. 

5) K-Pop artists and group are expected to behave like model citizens and role models, and when they misbehave in any way, they are quickly punished for it in the form of losing their fans or contracts with their agencies, so you won't see the kind of disgusting behavior we see in the west like Justin Bieber, Chris Brown, Kanye West, etc, and thus the youth wouldn't be negatively influenced by that kind of bad behavior and attitude. K-Pop entertainers take pride in being kind, considerate, humble and positive, and in general a wholesome and positive influence on the youth and society. Regardless of how much swagger and rebellious attitude they show on the stage, off-stage they are lovable and kind and considerate and polite. 

6) The K-Pop artists and groups are incredibly disciplined, since in order to perform at such a high level of difficulty, they would need to start training since they were children. The idols work incredibly hard to make their dreams come true and to always show their best for their fans, often to the point of exhaustion and passing out during live performances. That level of intense work ethic while is worrying (because we care about them), is also very inspiring and admirable. 

7) K-Pop artists and groups release new music and content far more frequently than most western pop acts. It's not unusual to get two to three new singles or EPs in one year, and see at least a dozen live performances on TV for each of those new releases, not to mention a slew of variety show appearances, live-streaming, social media posts, fan-meet events, etc. The rate and level of fan engagement is much higher in K-Pop, so there's something to look forward to almost every day.

8) Many K-Pop content are subtitled, so yes, you CAN understand the lyrics if you want to, and for many people it's also a great excuse to learn a new language, which is extremely beneficial for the development of our brains when young, and amazing for deterring and preventing Alzheimer's when we get old. Also, being open minded and experiencing/learning about another culture expands our horizon as human beings and only makes us better. 

9) If adults can watch a Pixar and Disney film and be thoroughly entertained, or even shed tears due to the emotionally moving moments in the story, then why can't adults of any age also be delighted by imaginative and entertaining choreography, great singing and dancing, beautiful fashion and styling, high production quality music videos, etc.? Both are often thought of as ""aimed at a younger audience,"" but the amount of talent, skill, and imagination required to produce those forms of entertainment can be admired by anyone of any age, sex, or cultural background. If you have functioning ears and eyes and brain then you have to ability to experience them and be entertained or moved by them. 

10) No, it's not ""creepy"" for older adults to be fans of younger musical artists/performers. Talent and skill transcends age, and we can admire and support and be a fan of anyone that deserves our respect and support, regardless of their age. Shirley Temple was a cultural phenomenon and she was just a little girl who sang and danced and acted her way into everyone's hearts. Were all those adults who loved her as an entertainer some kind of creepy pedophile? That's just ridiculous. While we can't deny there will always be a segment of fans whose fascination with the younger entertainers would be considered ""unsavory"" by society, we simply cannot paint all older adult fans with that same brush, as that would be extremely unfair. So give people the benefit of the doubt until they give you ample reasons not to.  This kind of prejudice against older fans is a problem even within the K-Pop fandom and it needs to stop. Younger fans don't understand how people's mentality change as they get older, so they just assume older fans are ""creepy."" They don't understand that older fans see the younger entertainers with the same kind of mentality as their cute and adorable little cousins, nieces and nephews, sons and daughters, or grandsons and granddaughters. We feel loving and protective towards them and wish to see them succeed in their aspirations and dreams, and we are also in awe of how much talent and skill and discipline they have at such young ages, and what they have to endure on their path to making their dreams come true. 

11) ""The dudes all act and dress like feminine homosexuals, and the girls are all high-pitched cringy school girl jail-baits acting like little kids while trying to be cute."" This is purely ignorance and prejudice. People who comment on the feminine styling on men seem to have no knowledge of history. Throughout the centuries, men's styling trends have at times been very feminine, with makeup. long hair, wigs, colorful and frilly blouses, skirts, dresses, and have feminine body language and spoke softly, etc. We don't even have to go that far back to centuries ago -- we only need to go as far back and the 1970's and 80's and look at the rock-stars of that era. Bands like Poison, Motley Crew, Dead or Alive, Duran Duran, and artists like David Bowie, Prince, Michael Jackson -- they were the megastars of that era and all wore lots of feminine makeup and fashion, or carried themselves in a very feminine manner. And the female fans around the world went wild for them. As for the school girl thing, it's such an ingrained thing in many East Asian countries to associate youthful females with school girl imagery, because education is so important in those countries, and girls in that age group are normally still in school, and the schools all require uniforms. So when idols of that age group are styled in the same manner, it's perfectly logical because that is the fitting imagery for girls of that age group. And if on top of that styling there are sexy elements, then it's exactly the same thing as when Britney Spears wore her school girl uniform while dancing sexy moves when she was around the same age. Western pop is no different in how they try to sexualize nubile females and use that as a selling point. And compared to how brazen western culture sexualizes women, K-Pop is far more modest in comparison. As for the higher pitched/more girly voice, it's simply a cultural preference thing, and most East Asian countries have that preference, as it sounds more pleasing to their ears. But not all K-Pop female artists/idols speak and sing like that, as there are plenty of exceptions where female artists/idols have lower pitched voices and sing with a lower pitch as well. And finally, when it comes to the aegyo stuff, this is simply a cultural difference. East Asian countries have always been fascinated with cute stuff, which is why we have Hello Kitty products being used even by adult women, or the Japanese ""buriko"" phenomenon, or the Korean concept of aegyo. Not all females in Asia utilize aegyo -- some even find it ridiculous and cringy, but it is just one unique aspect of East Asian culture that's quite different from western culture. There are plenty of K-Pop that has nothing to do with aegyo, such as the more mature, sexy, girl crush, or hip-hop concepts. And there's nothing wrong with finding aegyo entertaining and cute -- it is simply a preference, and you can take it or leave it. 

I hope these points I've covered above will help my fellow K-Pop fans better explain their love for K-Pop to those who don't understand, or are hateful towards it.  There are other aspects I could also cover but I think the ones above are the most relevant when it comes to explaining, promoting, and defending K-Pop. I find that when you emphasize the complex and sophisticated musicality and imaginative choreography and high quality music videos, is when it's easiest to make people understand why K-Pop is so compelling. The rest of it are more cultural differences and nuances.

Girl Front by Loona: I just love the angelic ""oooh""  in the background.

Kingdom Come by Red Velvet: So many great adlibs / harmonies towards the end.

Also this might be more K-r&amp;b but Heize's ""Jenga"" I also think has a great ending chorus. The background vocals fit and I love how the background vocals sing ""I dont wanna play this game..."" while the main vocal also sing the same line, but slower.

Some might not have a singing voice you love the most, but they might have a speaking voice you really love. There could also be ones whose singing voice you love but not their speaking voice. And of course there are those whose voice you love in both singing and speaking. 

My favorite speaking voice in K-Pop:

Eyedi - She's got a great combination of a girly but not overly cute voice that has both a deeper element and a higher pitched element blended together perfectly. Her timbre and inflections are very pleasing. I love her singing voice as well, as she's one of my favorite solo artists. 

Sohee (Elris)- She's got one of the cutest voices in K-Pop. But it's not the gratingly annoying kind--she just naturally has that girly timbre that's really adorable. 

Go Won (Loona) - Soft-spoken fairy of Loona. One of the softest voices in all of K-Pop. 

Xiyeon (Pristin) - Her slight lisp is really cute (and that's how she got her nickname, ""Ddi Ddi"" -- it's because she couldn't pronounce the S sound when she was younger and had to practice a lot to overcome her lisp). You can hear it in her speaking, rapping, and singing. 

Nancy (Momoland) - She has that classic Disney princess girly and expressive voice with melodious inflections.

Based on what you've seen of their personalities, How do you think your faves would do if they suddenly found themselves in a mafia-like-situation?
Like they were a part of the group? 

Can you picture such a situation? Or is it too ridiculous lol.
Would they be boss? Would they adapt? 

Mingyu isn't even my Bias but I was just thinking of how the only reason they wouldn't kick him out for his clumsiness is because he's the ""boy that can do everything"" and is still very useful to them. 

Nb. Obviously this isn't supposed to be taken sooo sooo seriously. ",2,1

- ""I'll never like girl groups/female kpop act"", 
Two things happened here - 

 I heard this song Ain't nobody by HA:tfelt. This was around 2014/2015. I reaaalllyy liked it and was so surprised. I started to check out more female soloists (eg Lim Kim) but still never got into girl groups because I thought they were too ""cute/childish"". (I believe a bunch of us had this phase)

The second tging was there were just too many videos of boy groups dancing along to girl group songs for me to ignore them for much longer.. (First girl group song I ended up sincerely  bopping to was Cheer up. )


- ""I will never get into a group with too many members"" 
This changed because of Ong SeongWoo. 
I saw that clip of his version of the Kang-Thigh-Grab (I loooved his sense of humor) and I just had to find out more about him and the group as a whole. Soon I learnt the name of all 11 members and that just opened the gates. 
Now my bias group is Seventeen, followed closely by NCT and grouos with like 4-6 members seem small now. 

- ""I won't bias/pay special attention to people younger than me. They're cute but I'll look at the older ones and the one's my age first.""

But with 90% of songs out there, there are always angry fans in the comments demanding justice for their biases. 

I used to think it was also pretty unfair, but honestly I don't think it matters that much. For one thing, the members who tend to get more lines are the ones who are a main vocalist or rapper (eg: EXO's Chen, Twice's Jihyo, Gfriend's Yuju, Monsta X's Kihyun), someone who is the most popular/the face (eg: Momoland's JooE, Wanna One's Daniel), or often times both (eg: SNSD's Taeyeon, NCT's Taeyong, gugudan's Sejeong). Sometimes the lead vocalists or rappers also get a lot of lines too (eg: Twice's Nayeon, Red Velvet's Seulgi). So in that sense, why shouldn't they get more lines? Vocals are what they specialize in, and they're given their positions for a reason. Don't give me that bullshit about everyone ""having a beautiful voice"" or ""their voices suit this song better!"" because that's subjective and just because you have a nice sounding voice doesn't necessarily mean you're a strong signer. And whether or not the aforementioned main/lead vocals or popular members are the strongest singers is true or not, they're still in their positions that the company assigned them.

Obviously though, there are some groups with rather questionable distributions, and this shows up more in the groups with more members. I'm probably gonna get a lot of hate for saying this, but in 99% of Kpop groups, there are members who are not that skilled when it comes to vocals or dancing. And that's absolutely okay. The Kpop industry is more than just who's the best singer or dancer; much of it has to do with the visual and face of the group aspect too. Why is Hyoyeon the main dancer in SNSD but Yoona's always in the center? Because Yoona's the visual, also assigned to a dancing position, and is one of if not the most popular and well known members. Why does WJSN's Dawon get so few lines even though she's a main vocal like Yeonjung? Because Yeonjung is more well known from I.O.I. Why is Sejeong recently dominating the gugudan songs? Because she's by far the most popular, and Jellyfish probably saw how she got her first solo win in seven days and want to capitalize off that. Companies are aware of which members attract attention, and that's why they choose to showcase the popular members more because they're the ones that people will recognize more easily. It's just how marketing works.

I think what most people get angriest about is when a member has minimal lines, center time, and no other promotions. Some members who don't sing as much still go on variety shows, get acting jobs, or have CF deals (AOA's Seolhyun is a prime example of this). Like in NCT, can most people outside the fandom actually name members other than Taeyong and Mark? How many people who aren't familiar with gugudan would know members other than Sejeong and Mina? It's more of the lack of any exposure at all that makes fans upset, because they feel like the company acts as if that member(s) doesn't exist. And I totally agree that that isn't right. No member deserves to get zero lines. Everyone should get at least one (and that's scraping the very bottom of the barrel), but should every member get the exact same number of seconds? Nah.

I know I just wrote this long spiel, but I also think that at the end of the day, it's really not that deep. Kpop is Kpop. I love it, and clearly everyone on this sub loves it. But at the end of the day, it's just pop music. It's also not the end of the world if some members of a group don't get a lot of singing time. Of course I don't think it's fair either if some members get like zero seconds (I'm looking at you, Catch Me by WJSN and like every NCT 127 song for Winwin). But just think of line distributions this way: Remember that one video where Tao's yelling at the Produce 101 Chinas girls for leaving that one girl behind when she needed help? He specifically said that he never got jealous or upset when another member was doing well, because their success meant more success for the group. So do you really think that some members will start hating another member for getting more singing time? Do you really think that these people who have formed a group together are sensitive enough to hate each other and get jealous because someone sings more? Do you really think these idols would be that petty?

No, they're probably not. And if they're not petty, the fans shouldn't be, either.

Do you guys remember Big Byung? Their theme was somewhat unserious and kind of goofy. 

What if we had more collabs like that? Who could you see collaborating and what theme could you see them doing. 

I thought of Johnny (NCT), Dokyeom (Seventeen) and Ong (WannaOne) being perfect for a totally gag-visual theme for example. Not just on stage too, they could carry on the character (complete with overdramatic acting with straight faces) when they go on interviews together or variety shows. 

What collabs could you see? And what themes? Between friends or between people who have something in common (a la my example)?

1128,2018-10-13,2018,10,13,14,9nrin6,Have there been any eras that just left you bald?,Nanabot95,1539409486,"Due to the styling, or hair? 

Any times you want to just tell the hairstylist Unnies and Oppas ! 

Whether its from your faves or other people from another whose style just caught your attention? 

I mean I always like WekiMeki Doyeon's face the moment I saw her, but while watching the M-relay dance, two other girls caught my eye (idk their names but they're both with black hair atm - one was so smiley ^uwu and the other was...well, yes ma'am. 

To mention a few of my faves though:
- Here I am loving Taeil's current red hair

- S.coups silver hair during Clap. I believe a lot of Carats lost hair follicles at his styling too. 

- Woozi's black hair (though I also really like his current too-short hair)

- Jeonghans styling during Thanks era. The particular outfit in the M-Relay as well. I loved this style because it suited him so much. It *did* make me think he looked like a sort of seductive, dangerous, Vampire though. 

- Blackhaired MulletHao was a whole look, plus his insta tbh. 

- I loved Jae's hair in the Shoot Me video! 


Some honourable mentions
+ Sungjin (Day6) hair was a shock at first but it grew on me. 

+ Junguwu these days has become ^uwufierce.",22,1
1129,2018-10-13,2018,10,13,14,9nrjda,make your kpop video translation (week 31),ThisGuyKpops,1539409726," 

Hi, my name is JOJO. I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. Word for word in the area where its necessary

Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. Leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48 hours to check. Good luck!

I'm a rapper and before the big day, I decided on a new rap song. I spent the whole night and that day memorizing it. Well, even though I thought I knew the song, I choked up in front of the judges. None of the words where poppin in my head. I definitely have the look down and I can rap but when I was there, I had a terrible audition. I feel like I have songs that I naturally memorized and don't even need the lyrics to pop in my head to rap them so I made a poor decision trying to learn a new song. Does anyone that has done Auditions have any tips? Honestly I'm a guy and I started to cry and die a little inside after my first audition went terribly.",5,1

Every single time Yuta sings, which isnt an awful lot, I always think its Doyoung singing. I have a hard time distinguishing between Taeil and Doyoung. I had the same problem with him and Jungwoo in Boss. Now when Johnny sings I think its Doyoung too. I love Doyoungs voice, I just think its a little strange how half of NCT127 sound like him. The only vocalists who dont sound like him are Jaehyun and Haechan, who are either a baritone or have a unique voice. 

Another example of this is EXID. I can tell Hani and Jeonghwa apart quite well, but not so much Hyerin and Solji. 

I also couldnt tell Joy and Yeri apart at the start when I first began listening to Red Velvet. 

Anybody have any more instances like this when people have very similar voices in a group. ",113,1

Shownu showing his abs in Hero lead to his sudden burst in popularity, and although Wonho has now became more popular for his abs, that shirt lift in hero definitely helped him get the popularity he has now.

I wasn't the biggest fan of Move at first, but after listening to it a few times I got hooked on the song and his voice. Now I can't get enough of him.

I'm also not a big fan of nasally voices, either, so I didn't like Tiffany or Seulgi's singing when I was first introduced to SNSD and RV. But now I think they sound so pretty. Another example of a voice I didn't used to like would be LE's, which is also mostly due to the nasally part. Then I heard her in Cream and fell in love lol.",50,1

The simplicity yet catchy songs in the whole album are so precious. And GFRIEND's Time For The Moon Night (which i am currently listening to right now) is a gem. So many hidden gems in this song esp Flower Garden which could've been a good title track (eventhough i really love TFTMN). And KARD's Ride On The Wind which most people judged cos of the title track. Moonlight and Dimelo are so good b-sides. What about you?,4,1

Least surprised:

 Ringa Linga by Taeyang being written and produced by G-Dragon. Its SUCH a GD party banger its not even funny. The name spelling intro and post chorus shouts are so classic GD. Bigbang kinda have this false perception that they only make party songs when they really dont, but GD is so good at them that it wouldnt bother me if they did.

 Energetic by Wanna One being written by Pentagons Hui. It just fits his voice so well, especially the chorus. I would love to hear a full Pentagon version of it but I would selfishly want Hui to sing the whole chorus.

Most surprised:

 The iconic trot banger Look at Me Gwisun by Daesung being written by GD. Its so weird it almost seems like a joke. Especially since it was actually successful and is still performed as Daesungs solo on BB tours after almost a decade. Mans is out here getting that trot money.

It can range from anything. To liking/disliking a song everybody like/didn't like, to ""I'm prob the 10% that don't check out the lyrics."" lmao.

It's an exaggeration, of course, but just something uncommon you see in Kpop fans.

I guess I'll start:

\- I'm prob the 10% (more like 5% maybe?) of the International fanbase that don't have bias wreckers. I'm pretty keened on someone when I like them.

\- Idk but I'll just add this in: I remember when BTS Idol came out, a lot of people weren't feeling it (not sure how Reddit responded since I don't remember checking) but I was prob that small percentage that was bopping the hell out of Idol when the chorus hit, as corresponding to the other feedback I saw that were all full of ""I'm disappointed."" etc.",446,1

I and Chris Kim are very interested in the Korean entertainment industry, but one day they came up with the idea of introducing the Korean people's kpop to English.

 He and I talked about this and that theme, and he, who knows how to YouTube, opened up a channel and went on as a narrator. It hasn't been long since we actually started operating.   Although I said it wasn't advertising, I would like to introduce you to one thing that this channel has better video than I thought.

Eeesh) but Im actually combining FIVE events in to one fanaccount so I dont spam up the sub. SO FAIR WARNING, THIS IS HELLA LONG. Im going to tell you about my experience at both the LOONAbirth In To Orbit debut concert, as well as four OT12 fansigns over the last few weeks. [PROOF.](https://twitter.com/kikistiel/status/1041726966854934528) It took me a million years to write this fanaccount because I was heading an album GO with HUGE thanks to r/LOONA for helping me with, but Ive finally wrapped up the GO and have had a breather to sit down and write. There is a lot to cover and so lets go!
 
First off, the LOONAbirth concert. I initially went to go camp overnight for merch for some silly reason. I argued with a security guard for a good 20 minutes who had kicked everyone out of the line to at least let me set my bag down for a spot in  line, which he allowed me to do eventually. After that, I hung out with some friends at a convenience store a little ways away waiting until around 4 or 5 when we could safely head back to the line. I waited until around 11am for the merch booth to open. I took a few pictures of the Hall as we waited for the sun to rise. 

[Merch booth] (https://imgur.com/QIdDjMH)

[merch samples] (https://imgur.com/9soe1vs)

While we waited, we could hear LOONA practicing inside the concert hall. There was one part of the rehearsal that sounded like a bunch of bombs going off. I later realized this was them performing favOriTe!!

I was around 10th or so in line, so I was able to get all of the items I wanted, including the [rare fanclub 1st gen postcard set](https://imgur.com/V977yp6),  which I adore! While I was checking out at the booth, they filmed a bit of LoonaTV, so you may see my hands touching blessed merch in a future episode

After merch, I went and took a couple hours nap because I was DELIRIOUSLY tired. I got about two hours of sleep for the entire weekend, and I didnt want to fall asleep at the concert, so I had to get some sort of snooze in. I went back to the venue at around 4pm. I helped a friend hand out freebie paper slogans and I passed out free prints of my loona artwork as well. Honestly orbits are so generous I received fanmade cards, fans, bookmarks, pens, lightsticks, and someone was even passing out heejin themed caprisun since it was so hot!

About 30 minutes before the show, I went in to the venue. At the door, they gave out the customary limited tickets theyve done at all other concert events, and I was lucky enough to get [my bias subunit OEC!!](https://imgur.com/ZXKM8sm) 

Once inside, I was so pleased to see that many fan sites had arranged charity gifts in loonas name! Instead of buying the girls gifts directly to congratulate them on their debut, they instead donated the money to charity, buying rice and other food/essentials for those in need. These were all set up directly when you first went in to the venue. [Here is what it looked like!](https://imgur.com/sVc0Xz4) And here is [another!](https://imgur.com/f9eQdDq) I think is one of my favorite parts of the whole event. Congratulatory gifts in the form of charity -- something the girls would be so proud of.

Finally, I was [at my seat!](https://imgur.com/pAkGG5A) The Hall was absolutely gorgeous. The venue appeared to be sold out if not nearly  the only empty seats were far in the back, and they were quite sparse. The venue wasnt too huge, which I was happy about. It still felt like a totally intimate affair. The stage was beautiful moving images of galaxies and stars played as we waited for the show to begin. [I Got out my orbit light stick and waited for the fun.](https://imgur.com/zZghh1S)

When the lights went down I admit my heart skipped a beat. This was it, finally, OT12 LOONA performing for orbits and the public for the first time. Finally, LOONA was debuting. I was sweaty palmed and my heart was racing, and when they immediately started a VCR of all 12 girls, the energy in the room was so palpable, it was insane. As we predicted, the girls began with favOriTe, and then had a short ment. 

Seeing the girls as OT12 performing for the first time (not counting the dance break from Line&amp;Up) was surreal. We had spent SO long seeing the girls as only individuals or subunits. We knew LOONA was a concept, but here we actually saw it in PERSON. This was the actual LOONA as one, cohesive unit. It almost didnt seem real, even though we knew it was going to be happening for two years, it almost seemed like it was still a pipe dream. They also performed  which is honestly my FAVORITE (lol) b-side on their debut album. An amazing song. It took me listening to it on the album later after release to truly appreciate it. 

I was yearning to see more solo songs performed and I wasnt let down when after ments, Heejin came out to perform her solo. I had seen her and Yeojin perform theirs at Line&amp;Up, but I was REALLY hoping all 12 would perform theirs at this final hurrah. Heejin has such a natural energy on stage. She was really born to be a performer. Shes gorgeous, shes talented, and vivid is STILL one of my favorite solos.

Now, up until this point, the guy sitting next to me had been *relatively* quiet throughout the concert. When it started, he had cheered like everyone else, especially after they performed favOriTe. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary and he just seemed like a quieter fan. But next, after Heejin finished, I assumed Hyunjin would perform her solo. What we ended up realizing was that instead of performing slower songs to keep the energy hype, they opted instead to forgo some solo songs to do duets instead. So, Heejin remained on stage, and suddenly Hyunjin appeared with her to perform their solo. And the guy next to me. Lost. His. *Shit.* I did not realize a human being could possibly scream so loud and for so long. Up until this point he had been weirdly silent, so I wasnt expecting it. I jumped and dropped my Slogan, light stick, and phone lol. At least he left no question who his bias is. 

After   (minus Vivi) had performed their solos and unit song and thrown chocolates at us, another VCR appeared on the screen, and I knew it was time for some motha fuckin ODD EYE CIRCLE. I have been a fan of Loona since their humble beginnings, but anyone who knows me even a bit knows that I became a hardcore loonatic after JinSoul graced my eyeballs. I was hopeful I would see my bias perform Singing In The Rain at Line&amp;Up, but that event ended up being more reserved for units and teasers. First, Choerry performed. Choerry has such an amazing stage presence, I was so shocked I adore her solo to the moon (ha) and back, and the crowd chanted Love Cherry Magic so loud during her song! 

After Choerry finished I waited for what felt like six years in total darkness waiting for that telltale start of SITR. I was so worried for some reason that they may not do it, since they had started with Choerry and not Kim Lip then they did Kimmie (who was amazing) and didnt have JinSoul in between... that maybe only two would get performed and they would stick to more unit songs. I was running on no sleep, and felt like bbc would pull a bamboozle on me again. However, after what felt like FOREVER, I finally heard it. The Hey boy!

There she was! My babe! Performing the solo that cemented my place in this fandom!! This was a huge moment for me as an orbit. Without this song, I dont know where I might have been today as far as loona goes. I owe this solo a LOT for my place in this fandom. I was so happy. I literally got misty eyed as JinSoul performed.  I was SO HAPPY. I felt like I had seen her story from start to finish and it was all culminating in this moment. All of the girls. On the last part of her song I was in full blown fat tears and I know I probably looked as stupid as I felt, but in my sleep deprived state I was just so proud to see her perform and doing what she loves. 

OEC ended up performing all three solos, plus Girl Front which was my summer JAM last year and finally ended with their rendition of Rosy. 

After OEC, it was Vivi and Yeojins turn. I especially loved Vivis solo song from the  girls. That song had always been one of the best, I think. I love the costumes, the retro vibe, everything! She mentioned afterwards in her ments that her mother was in the crowd, and sure enough a few rows back from me, her mother was sitting in the back with security and she looked so proud of her daughter! Vivi teared up a bit, and she spoke some words to her mother. It was so sweet. Vivi was my first ever bias in Loona. I had been following loona causally since Heejin, but had been keeping up with all their releases, just hadnt delved much deeper in to them. I even dug up this [old as hell comment of mine from when I was a budding baby orbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5xtnbi/comment/dekqjvq?st=JN92RM4I&amp;sh=e2047266) Sometimes I wonder what that Kiki would think of Kiki now, a full blown Orbit, and it makes me realize just how far Vivi has come too. Im really proud of her, and all of the girls. 

After Yeojin (the cutest bean, I saw some girls in front of me uwuing during her solo) and Vivi, yyxys turn!!

They began with Chuu and Yves solos, and then had Go Won and Olivia sing You and Me Together instead of their solos. I was a bit bummed, I know they wanted to strike slower solos to keep the energy and do duos this save time, but Egoist is still one of my favorite songs (and I dont think its slow), videos, concepts from the solos. The song really means a lot to me. I was sad they decided not to pursue it and a bit confused since those two solos are still some of my favorites, but I thought Ollie and Go Wons solo was so sweet and cute. Its another favorite bside!

After this yyxy performed love4eva and Frozen, and the girls all reconvened to perform Stylish. There was an amazing VCR that played before they came back as OT12, that really reinforced that LOONA was now here as a WHOLE, that they would be one 12 girl unit from here on out. 

They gave a special Happy Birthday celebration to Haseul, and after performed Perfect Love and said their goodbyes. Of course, there was an encore, and at the end of the show they finally concluded their debut concert with their debut song: Hi High!

So, that was it for LOONAbirth! It was literally everything I had wanted it to be and more -- I was so happy that I attended. It meant a lot for me to be there and support the girls after all their hard work and after all this time. The production and stages were amazing, costumes were on point, the girls were perfect and performed their hearts out It was honestly such a blur that its hard for me to narrow down specific details. Half because I was so sleep deprived that whole weekend, and also because it was just SO MUCH GOOD. There were so many things happening and they were all amazing so much so that my brain has turned to mush in its wake.

And it gets even more exciting, because after that I ended up attending the first four fansigns of their 6 sign promotion cycle. Starting the very next week!

Because it would be tedious (and probably boring for you guys) for me to recount every single fansign individually, instead Im going to split up the experiences by member and fuse all the fansigns together.

Before I start, I want to again give a huge shoutout to r/LOONA who were instrumental in helping me attend these fansigns by joining my album Group Order I held. I even did an art print for it that I ended up giving to the girls! They really came through with enough albums for me to attend so many, and even though the GO was stressful and a TON of work, I would do it all over again (and will for the x x repackage.) 


So without further ado, OT12 accounts for four full fansigns! A few notes that I get asked about when I make fansign accounts here or on twitter:

**HEEJIN**

The girls for every sign are positioned in the order they debuted in. So that means for every sign, Heejin was the first member I would interact with. I have to precede this account with a caveat of sorts -- I very much find Heejin the hardest to talk to. Not because she isnt sweet (SHE IS) and she is absolutely a warm and open person, but no matter how many signs you go to, you still have those butterflies in your stomach when you first approach them. By the time you get to the end of the line, you more or less feel like youre chatting with old friends, and youve gained your confidence, but the first few are always the hardest.


Heejin herself is an absolute angel. She is SO unnervingly gorgeous. She has huge, beautiful eyes, and a really deep, husky voice that is super alluring. Because I stumble over myself a lot while thinking in English but making it come out of my mouth as Korean, I felt worried that I may be annoying her, but when I apologized (at EVERY SIGN) she always would say no, youre doing so well! 


Heejin talked a lot about how she adores her fellow members. How she feels a lot of responsibility for LOONA and for its success. I told her ViViD made me a fan since the beginning and made me want to follow them after I saw it. She got really excited about that. I told her I wanted to draw a scene from it and she said she would hang it in her room if I did!


[*First sign post it:*](https://imgur.com/jXoZuAe) 

Q: What Hogwarts house do you think you should be in?

A: Gryffindor (she said she never took the test, but from what she knows of it, she thinks its this house.)



*Second sign post it:*

Q: Please draw the Heejin rabbit~

A: [picture](https://imgur.com/mN53Ii9)


: Is this a cat? Lol

: Its a rabbit! See? A rabbit... the ears... the paw...

: Ah I see it!

: Do you? Unnie are you just saying it to be nice... 


**HYUNJIN**

I have always really adored Hyunjin since her solo is one of my favorites of the solos. Shes also quirky, and hilarious. One thing I noticed about Hyunjin at both concerts but also especially at more intimate settings like fansigns is that she is REALLY. SASSY. I always thought that Hyunjin was like, the quietest and more shy members -- but shes actually quite the opposite? Shes really bubbly and says some pretty (hilariously) off the wall things sometimes.

Hyunjin is also one of the most conventionally Korean visuals of the group, I think. Like, every single member of the group is gorgeous, bar none. But I think Hyunjin has the kind of beauty that is seen as a very Korean beauty. She has a ton of loyal Korean fans. 

Also, at every single sign I went to, Hyunjin always greeted me with a HIIIIIIIIII, in this very high, very excited tone that made my heart melt. She also loved to hold my hand with her fingers laced in mine towards the end of our conversations. Hyunjin likes to talk a lot -- and also ask a lot of questions. Normally fans ask members a ton of questions as they sign, but Hyunjin always seemed genuinely interested in ME and what *I* was up to. Where are you from, how long are you here, where did you learn Korean, what is your favorite non-Loona song? Etc! So much so that when she signed my album at the first sign, she was so engaged she almost forgot, and had to quickly sign it at the end. This means she unfortunately couldnt answer my post it -- but I was totally happy anyways, and she did do my second one!

*First sign post it:*

Q: Draw unnie (me) as what animal you think she would be if she were in Loona~

A: [she didnt have time to answer, but she verbally said a cute mouse. Here is her sign!](https://imgur.com/mr2nBie)

*Second sign post it:*

Q: Please draw your cat and its bread~

A: [picture](https://imgur.com/raFKy6e) 

: A bread cat? A cat with bread or a bread cat?

: My Korean isnt good enough to say which one. 

: Im going to give it bread for eyes. 

: Ah?!

: Bread-eye bread-cat!


**HASEUL**

Everyones favorite Mom! I can totally see why shes the mom of the group. Haseul is really gorgeous. Even her eyes have this natural sparkle in them. She has this striking beauty that is really calming and relaxing. She also has *quite* good English! Of all the members, Haseul, ViVi Yeojin, and Yves have the best English abilities. However, I still spoke to her mostly in Korean. 

Haseul is more of a listener than a talker. She was always asking me about my experiences as an orbit and -- interestingly -- if we thought LOONA was living up to our expectations for their debut. I told her that it was everything I had wanted and more. On more than one occasion she asked me if LOONA was doing well overseas. I said that LOONA has an incredibly loyal and large following abroad. So many international orbits contribute to projects, buy albums and goods, to support them. At the last fansign, she had sort of wondered aloud while signing if LOONA would ever do activities overseas. I told her that they would have an indescribable amount of support if they did. She seemed really surprised and elated about that.

I also had to tell Haseul that her singing was so incredible and I loved that she had been classically trained and studied opera for a time. I said her voice sounded like heaven to me -- and she said orbits are her heaven, too.

*First sign signature:*
my post it fell out of my album before I got up to her and I couldnt remember the question. :( [But heres here sign!](https://imgur.com/A6vXYWS) 

*Second sign post it:*
Q: Please draw your representative animal~
A: [picture](https://imgur.com/5mOlnxL) 

: Ah... draw... how... haha

: You can do it!

: Like this?

: What is that?

: Its eye! What else would it be? Haha! 

: Its so cute! 

: I know!!


**YEOJIN**


FIRST OFF, YEOJIN IS SO FUCKING CUTE. She takes her job as resident maknae VERY SERIOUSLY. She is the perfect mix of sassy, sweet, cute, and fierce all at the same time. One of the first questions I immediately asked her was when rap god Yeojin would be making more appearances. She said soon. 

At the very first sign, she opened with Welcome to the Loonaverse! when I sat down in front of her. She told me my Korean was quite good, and I said no &gt;_&gt; Its really not. I said I have to study a lot more, and she told me, I will study English hard, too. Next time we meet and every time after that, we will become like old friends.

During the second sign, I had worn my hair in space buns that sort of resembled Yeojins Kiss Later hair -- by total accident. She asked me about it while answering my post it, and said Your hair looks like mine did. She put her hand over mine and leaned in close, tone very serious. Was it on purpose unnie? Is this destiny?

At the last sign, I told her that I wanted to try to do my hair like hers one day. She leaned forward and said Get a good look at it then, it takes so long to do!

Yeojin is honestly the cutest person alive, probably. And shes also a firecracker, too. 


*First sign post it:*

Q: Whats the best and hardest part about being the maknae?

A: *cutely*: there are none (bad parts) [Im happy!](https://imgur.com/LH5DlHw)

A: [picture](https://imgur.com/2M8TA9D)

: Ah! Youre right. 

: Was it on purpose unnie? Was it destiny? 

: I didnt dry my hair properly before I left... 

:  

(She drew the frog eyes as my hair.)


**VIVI**


I was nervous to first speak with Vivi. She was my first bias in LOONA and ultimately the catalyst (as I showed earlier in the post) that got me diving deeper in to LOONA past just their releases. I was nervous because of not only how much I love her, but also because Korean is both my and her second language, and we are both admittedly not perfect. I was surprised to learn that she actually speaks English QUITE well. I guess it makes a lot of sense given that she is from Hong Kong -- but I didnt realize how much she knew.

We talked a lot at each fansign about both of our struggles learning Korean and living in a country where the primary language is still hard for us to master. Vivis skills at listening and speaking Korean are incredibly advanced, but she has a harder time with reading Korean while simultaneously having a conversation. Because of this, she wasnt able to read and answer my first post it. I felt quite bad, because she seemed to be very apologetic about it, and deeply upset, like she thought she had let me down. I wish I could have told her more concretely that it wasnt a big deal, and that her company was more than enough. :(

She told me that Korean is very hard for her because its *so* different from her native language. But she is trying.

At the second sign, when I asked her to draw her animal, she spent so much time on this GORGEOUS deer. I had no idea Vivi was such a talented artist :( She seemed to really enjoy drawing it, and I, as well as Yeojin cooed and awwd over it as she did it. I asked her to please draw more in the future, and to show fans. At the third fansign, she even remembered who I was. ;__;

[*First sign autograph*](https://imgur.com/GJAXcZc) 

*Second sign post it:*

A: [picture](https://imgur.com/E9H37pL) 

: Your Korean is so good. 

: YOUR Korean is so good!

: No! I must study!

: Wahh the deer is so lovely!

(yeojin): Wow unnie is upstaging all our drawings

**KIM LIP**

Kim Lip, to me, is the knock out of the group. Everything about her is insanely pretty from head to toe. Shes also so great at fanservice. Shes extremely extroverted and very kind and bubbly. Unfortunately her one and only downside is her drawing abilities. More on that later lmao.

At our very first sign, as I was talking to Kimmie, she was talking about being excited to promote when she glanced down and mid sentence just stopped and lets out this AHH sound. She grabs my hand from where it sat on the table with both of her own hands,  and holds it close to her eyes. Your hands! Both of my hands have tattoos, including double knuckle tattoos. I love your tattoos! (she said this part in English). I said thank you, blushing so hard, and she continued to hold my hand and rub her thumb all over my fingers.

Are these real? she asked. I said yes, and I asked her if she ever wanted to get a tattoo. 

Something small, she said. I want something pretty. Maybe one day.

After that, at every subsequent sign I attended, she remembered me by my hands, and held them for the entire time we spoke each time. ;___; I will never forget that. I told her her hands were really soft and that she was very cute. She said no, youre so cute. I gave her this comical look of disbelief and she laughed REALLY hard and slapped my hand cutely! 

At the fourth sign, as I came up to her she was holding a giant pizza plushie. I sat down and she gave me a very serious look.

Pizza or chicken? She asked immediately.

Chicken.

Of course. Fried?

Yes. Yangnyeom. And you?

She glances over at the giant plushie in her arms. She looks back at me. Pizza. Of course.

I think Kim Lip was one of the easiest members for me personally to talk to, we really clicked!

[*First sign post it:*](https://imgur.com/hiSEfr6) 

Q: Which Hogwarts house do you think you belong in?

A: Gryffindor! (she was unsure about this one!)

*Second sign post it:*

Q: Please draw your representative animal~

A: [picture](https://imgur.com/KvDUSRP) (I SERIOUSLY QUESTION IF KIM LIP HAS EVER SEEN AN OWL IN HER LIFE)

: Eh?! An owl?! I dont know how to draw an owl! Ill copy my picture (on the other page)

: Ah...What is...

: This is me as an owl.

: What is on your head..

: Unnie please tell me its nice

**JINSOUL**

Jinsoul is my ult loona bias, my love, my angel ;_; The one who lured me in to the loona life for good I was SO nervous to talk to her. Shes such a badass? Shes so effortlessly cool and she exudes this very regal air about her I dont even know how to explain it but man, I love her to bits. I noticed that Jinsoul doesnt really pose for cameras the same way the others do. At fansigns, when the girls arent preoccupied by a fan in front of them, they generally play up to the crowd and do cute poses and interact. And I took pictures myself, so I got a lot of cute shots of the members giving hearts to the camera and being adorable. And then I look at all my Jinsoul pictures Where Chuu or Choerry would pose with a cute heart or smile, Jinsoul would grit her teeth or puff out her cheeks and go cross eyed and pretend to be holding a gun and sniping the camera shes looking at. That girl is totally off her rocker and HONESTLY, A QUEEN. 

Shes even more quirky when talking. She has a really great self-deprecating humor about her, and shes catches you off guard with some of her replies.

At the first sign, I gave her a larger version of the [Jinsoul print Id drawn many moons ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LOONA/comments/8pbtdl/finally_submitting_this_jinsoul_i_did_to_rloona_i/) I gave her a smaller version at a previous sign, so I wanted to give her the bigger one now. I had barely even gotten it out of the bag when she made grabby hands for it and she said she had the smaller on her bed. (I was like, you mean over? Or is this my shitty Korean at work making me hear the wrong things lmao). She gave me so many compliments on it and guys I honestly couldnt handle it, I was so sheepish and shy. I turned straight back in to a statue person and couldnt say much else for the whole encounter. 

I had written on her post it Youre my favOriTe and she looks up at me gives me a heart and a wink and in a very sinister(???? lmao) manner she just goes You. You are my favorite. (the last word she sang like the line in the song). 

Honestly, shes a trip. During the second sign she was drawing a blue betta on my post it, and she for some? Reason?? Drew her head on it. And I couldnt help myself. I straight up told her it was kind of scary! I said Id still hang it in my room. She SNAPPED the album shut and said. Unnie. Dont put scary things in your room. Thats how ghosts get in.

Every encounter with Jinsoul left me more confused and in love than before.

*First sign post it:*

Q: Please write me a word of encouragement for when I am feeling sad.

A: [Fighting always! FIST BUMP](https://imgur.com/uZ7Z3t1) 

*Second sign post it:*

Q: Please draw your blue betta~

A: [picture](https://imgur.com/a6QQjBW) I &lt;3 U!

: It is so cute!

: I think so!

: But a little... scary Im going to hang it in my room.

: Dont put scary things in your room! Then a ghost will come!

**CHOERRY**

I dont know how I lived my life without Choerry in it until now. :( She is such an incredibly sweet, beautiful, cute girl. She is so energetic, and I find her so mesmerizing to watch at fansigns. I tripped up a lot when I spoke to her, and I seriously dont even know why at all. I guess I was just extra nervous talking to her because she is so pretty in person. She was always very encouraging when I would take a while to come up with decent Korean to speak, and one time she did the love cherry magic hand motion to me and I almost died of the cute. She told me to try it, but I was so embarrassed that I totally shut down after attempting it, so she did it for me.

She also has a habit of talking in the third person, which is so charming and adorable. She held my hand and told me my hands were very soft. I am still to this day confused as to how someone so cute and sweet could be the same Choerry in the hardcore girl crush OEC subunit, but thats how talented she is! 

I think, like Chuu, Choerry has a very natural aegyo. Normally I dont particularly like idols doing hardcore aegyo, probably because it feels forced? But those two, it feels like they would be doing it no matter what whether they were idols or not. It feels so genuine on them! Choerry quickly climbed high on my bias list after attending the fansigns. ;__; I stan her with my whole cold dead heart now.

: Unnie here are my heart cherries for you. (in the drawing) Do you like cherries?

: ......

: AH?!

: I like them a little!!!

: AHH!! 


**YVES**

I nearly had a heart attack the first time I sat down in front of Yves at this sign. Mainly because YVES REMEMBERED ME FROM THE YYXY FANSIGNS. I was super shocked. She said Hello, Im happy to see you at this fansign as well. I missed you~ LIKE? OKAY YVES? Just rip out my heart why dont you, I dont need it anyways.

Yves is another member that I find extremely easy to talk to. Maybe its because I had talked to her before at the yyxy fansigns so I was a bit less nervous, but she has a very caring air about her when you talk to her. If I stumbled over words and apologized, she always told me I was doing well.

She is always so sweet and just looks so concerned for every fan she talks to, she listens very intently, giving you clear eye contact and not distracting herself with signing as she listens. At the fourth fansign, when I had given all the girls a copy of the print, I had just given Choerry hers, and Yves (who had just finished with a fan) looked down at it and went to go point at it, saying Oh wow!! when she accidentally knocked over Choerrys water bottle right on to the print. She was MORTIFIED, she was so upset thinking shed ruined it and she tried to dab at the water saying Im sorry Im sorry in English over and over. The print was on glossy paper, so it was honestly totally fine! A nice manager came over and took the print to clean it off, and came back with it totally unharmed. I didnt notice this is until after I sat down, but Yves had actually [written Sorry T_T in my album when she signed because she still felt bad about the accident!](https://imgur.com/LQqYGE0) 

[*First sign post it:*](https://imgur.com/vIbpAIa)

: It has two mouths! 

: Ill give the second mouth teeth like mine.

: Ah, its cute! 

: Unnie please;;; haha

**CHUU**

I mentioned this before in my yyxy fansign accounts, but honestly Chuu is just the queen of fanservice. She is a natural born idol. I think she would have been successful no matter what company or group she would have ended up in. She has a totally natural cuteness to her that is over-the-top but not annoying, is charming and energetic and just downright incredible. ALSO. She REMEMBERED MY NAME. At the second fansign, she greeted me as Kiki-unnie. Im pretty sure Im writing this from the beyond the grave, because this was what killed me. 


Chuu loves to hold or touch people in some way when she talks to them. Some idols just like to ground themselves by touching a fan while they speak, to make it clear 1000% of their attention is on you. She loves to high five, lace her fingers with yours, or go in for a high five and then deceive you by actually pulling your hand in to her instead. 


Her English is also quite good. She said she wants to learn more because she knows Loona has a large international fanbase. Honestly every time I talked with her, she left me happily exhausted because of how much energy she exuded. I think Chuu honestly, truly loves every single fan that comes to see her. Its apparent in the way she engages with your and can sense if you are down or embarrassed. She likes to draw fans out of their shell and comfort zones. I dunno why, but I just trust Chuu with my life.

*First sign post it:*

Q: [Where would you love to go visit?](https://imgur.com/kM0JPK1)

(wtf chuu pls dont do this to my heart)

**GO WON**

Go Won, my small cute bean. She",,
is truly petite all over. Even her hands are so small and dainty. She is kind of like this embodiment of elegance and grace? Shes a lot more soft spoken, not necessarily shy, but just softer, so as a very shy person myself we had to be a lot more creative when speaking with each other because we both are more listeners than talkers.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, Go Won is such a concerned angel to her fans. At the 3rd sign, I hadnt eaten anything since the previous morning because the album GO was very stressful and I was working on that, and then had to get ready for the fansign. I had made larger versions of the yyxy print I had made to give to the girls (when I gave Go Won hers, she excitedly told me she had the previous one Id given her hanging on her wall ;__;  ) so I was tired and very hungry. I was sneakily trying to eat some bread I had brought without being distracting or getting caught, but just as I had stuffed a huge piece in to my mouth I saw Go Won staring right at me from her seat on the stage! I was so mortified that I just quickly stuffed it all in my mouth and swallowed it down, and from her seat Go Won mouthed, Are you hungry? to me. I nodded yes, and she gave me a thumbs up to keep eating. She mouthed Are you sleeping? and put her head in her hands, and then mimed playing on a game controller, as in, Are you playing lots of video games? I nodded yes and she gave me two big thumbs up and mouthed Good! What an angel :(,

**OLIVIA HYE**,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
One thing about Olivia is that I call her my adorable awkward gothic baby. She is IMPOSSIBLY sweet, and shes so excitable that she kind of forgets that shes at a fansign with fans, and sometimes talks like shes rambling to a friend when she talks about things she excited about. Which is honestly one of my most favorite things in the world. All you have to do is ask her one question and off she goes, chatting away endlessly about whatever it is. I asked her about her favorite video game, and she literally talked excitedly about it for a whole minute. She genuinely loves to talk with fans and tell them fun stories.. It truly makes you feel close to her. I could listen to her ramble for hours.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the second sign, she said that my hair looked like Yeojins from Kiss Later, and she even did the Kiss! Kiss! Kisseuneun daume! hand motions and line in the cute voice just like Yeojin does. When I said she was so, so cute, she just shakes her head sheepishly, but didnt outright deny it! ,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told Olivia that Egoist is one of my favorite solo tracks, because the loving yourself and putting yourself first is a really wonderful message to send in a song, and I think her MV was beautiful. She said that to love someone else fully, you have to first love yourself fully. :(,,,,,,,,,

At the fourth sign, my last one of the cycle (I had to sadly miss the last two due to personal reasons) I gave all twelve girls a large 12x18 print of the [LOONA debut art I had done that incorporated both Hi High and favOriTe!](https://twitter.com/kikistiel/status/1038512196026695680) ,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was extremely nervous about it, being that I had never given so many of them copies of my art before, and this was extremely nerve-wracking for me. All of them were so incredibly kind and sweet and excited about my art. The all asked if I had drawn it and were really happy to know I had done it for them. Heejin said that she really liked the way I drew her. Hyunjin said that me giving her a cats eye was a neat idea. Choerry kept hers with her at her seat for a long time afterwards, and drew cutely on it all over. I totally wish I could own the copy she drew stuff on, it was so cute! (I have a picture of it at the end). Olivia really loved hers, she asked me if I would draw for the next comeback too, and I said of course I would! I told her Ill give her an even bigger size print and she made me promise to it!,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cant believe OT12 Loona now own art by me in their dorms. I cant even begin to say how that feels as an artist. I dont know if its really hit me yet. Here are a collection of pictures of the girls holding my art up!,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lastly, I dont have an album of HQ images that I took for these fansigns unfortunately. I took a couple that I never was able to get around to editing, I was just too busy finishing my GO, busy taking care of so many things, but I promise to edit some one day and upload them in better quality! Unti then, here is a small album of some previews and other LQ pictures I took that show the girls individual personalities a bit more! ,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally, I think that wraps it up for me for this fan account. This was really long, but Im so happy to have been able to share a small bit of it. Being able to attend not one, but many of one of my two ult groups is truly a blessing. LOONA really has something special that I think will help them go far and higher and higher until they reach the top. They all have such vibrant, and unique personalities which make them shine so brightly. I will be doing it again for the x x repackage, so I will see you all very soon with another long ramble I'm sure.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you especially if you made it this far. And, as always, stan LOONA.,,,,,,,,,

Which companies give their artists opportunities to grow, allow for their creative input, and would protect and support their artists through difficult times? 

When a similar discussion was posted here a few months specifically regarding work life balance for artists, CUBE was a frequently-applauded company - something that I found interesting in hindsight. The recent trouble with Cube, Hyuna, and Edawn have split opinions and brought up much discussion of a companies and artists obligations to each other. Im wondering if the last few months have affected how you all regard companies nowadays.

It generally depends on the feel of the song but when I know the meaning of the lyrics, that could be a factor. I don't necessarily imagine an entire MV but certain bits just have certain feels that spin certain thoughts.

These days I have both versions of Comeback by NCT127 on repeat (I never listened to the Japanese version before and just them both, they're totally my style) and I can't help but imagine an angst/puzzle-like, dark themed MV with a fair amount of running, where the boys are all separated and facing their individual fears (nightmares). 

Eg. Johnny waking up as Haechan and proceesing to smash up mirrors/reflective surfaces in terror. 

At the build up toward the first chorus, Doyoung running away from the growing darkness in a corridor towards a door at the end only to fall into darkness. I imagine we get a beautiful tear here. 

Mark having being stuck in a bus having a never-ending ^LONG-ASS ride. Everytime he tries to get off, he somehow ends up in another bus. (^I'm sorry but it works though!)

Yuta or Jaehyun being a prince getting married. We see a backstory of how he had to accept the responsibility of getting married in order to have his one and only friend's life spared from the gallows. (Cameo by Heechul as the King) He sighs and resigns to what seems to be his future. 

And we see a scene of Taeyong also looking back at the palace as he leaves banished for what appears to be treason. He had grown up in the palace though he wasn't royalty were very close. He was to be Yuta's (Jaehyun's) right hand man but a scandal happened. (Idk man)

Idk for the other members but these scenes feel like they'd make a nice MV for the song.

As far as i'm aware, Bigbang's albums are nowhere in the Top 30 best selling Korean albums of all times, neither they have ever win any Album Of The Year awards in any major awards show. According to Oricon and Gaon, Bigbang's entire sales have never surpassed 10 millions mark, so how is this possible?

Do you mimic your faves habits perhaps? 
(I tend to mimic certain things from people I like in general). 

I definitely mimic more. Like when I'm watching a variety show or vlive and someone moves their hands or head in a certain way, half the time I'm almost always going to follow suit. (Cue Momo with ""monjo al ji"")

Sometimes, if I'm listening to a song in public (via headphones) and really vibing, I'll move some part of my body just a liiitle bit as similarly to the choreo as I can. Mostly my hands.

Also, are there any similarities you have noticed that you have with certain figures in Kpop?

- I share the same date of birth with one of the Jihoons. 

- My name is a compound name, the first part od which is ""Nana"" so I have literally been Nana since I was little.

Mnet has already made known the tropes it guns for in each season, so I'd love to know who'd be the stereotypical ""leader"" that gets pushed, the ""ace"", etc. I personally would love more collaboration between groups, and esp between idols of different genders, because I love the potential it gives for a diverse amount of music/dance to be produced.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear what y'all have in mind for this idea, I personally think members of Gfriend would fulfill the ""cute girl"" roles, but there'd be steep competition for male idols.",5,1

Did Bigbang really sold 140 Million records? Are they truly the best selling boyband in the world? I'm having a hard time thinking that they sold more than SMAP, 1D, BackstreetBoys or Arashi for that matter. 

Are they really that big? How popular they are? How they compare to BTS and 2nd generation idols?

As far as i'm aware, Bigbang's albums are nowhere in the Top 30 best selling Korean albums of all times, neither they have ever win any Album Of The Year awards in any major awards show. According to Oricon and Gaon, Bigbang's entire sales have never surpassed 10 millions mark, so this is a wrong information that has spread within the kpop community that **NEED** to be addressed in order to not cause any confusion and spreading false info.

Will be covering the story with bullet points so I'm able not to misinterpret sentencing. 

*Press conference is still underway, will continue to add more sources and facts once published*

------------------


* Lee Seokcheol shares that both he and his brother, Lee Seunghyun have endured being beaten by Producer A

* Kim Changhwan, their CEO, was aware of the situation and would watch the two of them be beaten up in the 5th floor studio

* For the past 4 years, beginning in 2015, he and his brother would be clubbed by a baseball bat, the abuse would occur everywhere within the company, studios, practice rooms

* The members were hit at times more than 50 times across their bodies with a baseball bat, at times when they were hit in the head, there would be lots of blood

* While being beat up in these rooms, the members of TheEastLight. had no where to run because rooms would be locked

* Seokcheol also shares that when he wasn't following instructions or made mistakes, he would be choked with a guitar string.

* Seokcheol and Seunghyun's parents would visit every week, but they were so afraid of sharing the truth due to death threats by their Producer - specifically that they would die if they shared what was going on

* Seokcheol and his brother Seunghyun have moved out of the group's dorm and are currently staying somewhere near the studio

* Seokcheol is currently now receiving psychological therapy to help with the trauma that he has had to face

* Seokcheol shares he cannot comment on the other members assault but assures that if an criminal investigation is opened, truth will reveal itself

I don't know how indicative it is of the industry necessarily but it also seemed pretty important in all of the Produce 101s that trainees were able to compose music/write lyrics/choreograph performances too. 

Older groups/artists like NU'EST, B1A4, Big Bang, IU, etc. in general seem to have started to compose their own music after gaining some seniority/having been debuted for a while. I also think I remember a couple years back that SHINee's Jonghyun had said something to the effect of idols can write their own music, but they have to go through the same process that anyone else might go through to compose a song for them, and the songs really do have to be good. 

Do you think companies will start or have already started teaching their trainees to compose for themselves? How do you all think this is going to affect the industry and do you prefer when idols write their own music? ",44,1

This is Kim Changhwan, both president and general manager for Media Line Entertainment, being TheEastLight.'s company.

Firstly, as someone responsible for both Media Line Entertainment, and TheEastLight., I sincerely apologise for being unable to properly manage the staff of the company.

During Lee Seokcheol's Press Conference, I watched while feeling both hurt and sick when I myself had discovered the news of the members (of TheEastLight.) being abused. I would like to once again state that I have never been part of any abuse or assaults in the last 30 years. I have also never encouraged or provided orders for abuse towards anyone. This includes nurturing the members of TheEastLight..

I will accept the submission of critics being sent my way for my behaviour and wrongdoings. I will reflect and try to resolve all conflicts with an honest mindset. I will provide you with future news for the 4 remaining members of TheEastLight.

Once again, I deeply apologise for the controversy created over this issue.

October 19th, 2018  Kim Changhwan

Im new to Kpop and currently listening to a lot of SHINee. Ive found them to be probably one of the most creative idol groups I have had the chance to listen to so far, and set my personal bar for idol groups pretty high.

I am currently trying to study their music and conceptual history comparatively. I was wondering what particular idol boy groups predated SHINee/debuted before and which ones debuted after, especially the ones that really peaked in the fandoms and are still going strong today? 

For example, I know that Super Junior came before SHINee and EXO came after, but Im not entirely familiar with others outside SM ENT.

I could list some of the famous after (e.g. 2PM, BTS, Monsta X, BTOB) but Im not familiar with a lot and I am not sure if they are considered after or if they debuted at the same time.

I think Im also trying to see  since SHINee has such a unique group aesthetic  what made them different from the groups that came before them (the freshness factor), and how were they influential to the ones that came after (the legacy factor)

Opinions, ideas are all very welcome. Thank you very much ",2,1

My favorites are the first chorus of Move with Taemin's subtle dance, the shot in CLC's Black Dress when Yeeun turns her head and has short hair, and in NCT U's Boss when WinWin just marches on out in the last chorus ~~in his only two seconds of screentime but whatever I'm not bitter.~~

Other shoutouts go to the cut of Daniel saying ""Boomerang"" for the first time in Boomerang (and that opening dance and instrumental is so cool too), the combination of Hwiyoung's voice and arm lift in Now or Never, literally every second of Hyolyn's Dally, that Woohyun appearance and key change in the last chorus of The Chaser, and also Seulgi's dance move where she mimes firing a gun in Bad Boy.",118,1

Hi, my name is JOJO. I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48 hours to check.

\[edit\]: done for this week.",2,1

1850,2018-10-20,2018,10,20,20,9ptban,Why are K-netizens such assholes?,psynetik123,1540033929,"So apart from r/kpop, I've been lurking other kpop fandom websites such as AllKpop and Netizenbuzz. After spending a fair amount of time on them, I am seriously just blown away at what toxic cesspools they are. It's as if someone took the most miserable, self-loathing, basement-dwelling losers on this planet and decided to make them all Kpop fans. With them, it's a never-ending litany of insults about how such-and-such idol is a 'bitch', a 'slut', a 'whore', how she should just go ahead and kill herself because nobody likes her. Constantly making fun of her looks and calling her ugly, often to the point where she ends up getting plastic surgery in response to the relentless taunting, only to be made fun of once again and labelled a 'plastic monster' for having surgery done, even though the people making fun of her are usually butt-ugly troglodytes themselves. And finally, when they can't find anything legitimate to nitpick about her, they go ahead and literally fabricate lies to publicly humiliate her for who-knows-whatever-the-fuck reason apart from filling some empty void in their pathetic lives. Just a few examples:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Park Bom being declared a drug dealer and scum of the earth simply for trying to import some medication to treat her mental illness. Nevermind all of the other hatred she gets for her looks.

\- Ditto for Top when he was caught smoking weed.

\- Accusations of Hyuna being a 'slut' and that she had ruined EDawn's career by deliberately seducing him.

\- Immediately jumping to conclusions about Goo Hara's assault and dragging her through the mud even before the full details had been revealed yet.

\- Accusing Solji of being lazy and telling her to just go ahead and leave EXID even though she was busy recovering from surgery.

\- Calling Tzuyu an 'idiot' and a 'moron' for brandishing a Taiwanese flag on national television, even though she's just a kid and probably had no inkling of the massive uproar that waving a little flag could cause.

\- Concocting dating rumours first between Jennie and Teddy, and now between her and YG.

\- The whole shitshow surrounding Taeyeon and Baekhyun.

\- Literally anything and everything to do with Yeri.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I used to play League of Legends, and the level of vitriol on display in that dumpsterfire of a game doesn't reach anywhere near the toxic trainwreck I find myself constantly facepalming to in the weird and wacky world of Kpop. Combine that with the stalking and harassment committed by sasaengs and the completely unjustified treatment of idols who are caught dating, it just boggles my mind how fucking cruel people can be to people they've never even met before. I mean, for fuck's sake, didn't their parents ever them that if they didn't have anything nice to say, then just don't fucking say anything at all???",4,1

*alternative title two: the show must go on*

**WARNING: LONG TEXT POST AHEAD!!**

**Introduction**

Hello r/kpop! It really is quite a coincidence that I attended this concert at the Star Theatre on this Saturday, exactly one year after I attended a [different concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/77x0wr/fan_account_171021_distant_worlds_jiritsu_in/) at the same venue. In any case, I will attempt to recreate my experience in full prose. If you'll be attending Redmare in future and do not wish to be spoiled, please close this tab now! Thank you for reading!

Event date: Sat, 20 Oct 2018 (6pm)  
Venue: The Star Theatre, Singapore

*****

**Before the Concert**

The Singapore stop was confirmed in late August, with ticket sales opening on 8 September. Within the first fifteen minutes, I managed to snag a Cat 3 ticket which cost SGD212 (= USD154 = GBP118), towards the back in the middle section of the theatre's lower circle, which is essentially the second floor. I'll draw some comparisons (which you can skip if you just want to get to details about the concert itself):

* For Redmare, Cat 1 tickets cost SGD292 while Cat 2 tickets cost SGD252. (To keep things simple, I will exclude discussion about restricted view seats.) Tickets for TWICE's first concert (The Opening) here last year cost exactly the same. Tickets for IU's upcoming concert here in December cost SGD20 less for each category.
* Two floors - the stalls and lower circle, with total seating capacity of 3.7k - were opened up for today. Both had empty seats, though they were relatively few and far in between and/or concentrated towards the back of the theatre. Three floors (stalls, lower circle and upper circle, with total seating capacity of 5k) were opened up for both TWICE and IU. I'm not sure how TWICE fared - I'm sure they sold well! - but IU has notably sold all tickets for the first two floors thus far.

While waiting for September to end, we got a [video message](https://www.facebook.com/OneProductionSingapore/videos/474087499756657/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCs5fzrArcrNjReqCRT-ZPkxygGZj8zvC_H60wzeHXFGLlQWD7lSLNSjIRHEhgsEUf79t_P5fIP_MYkP98n70hPr6bw8eYQ85vFhwlhvpeF6pzkUF9grsUTGxErwnPeMtWMhEk31nL0ktyhytFYbpgcwiVagx1XE0w7Fhke9_HEgUci1TGpFuRGPx4VVMuUV1MOkxrWJhLh2LeHTRTq8YExbRQiVj8-5BezxrCPAglPXg&amp;__tn__=-R) from the girls themselves!!

**Concert Day**

Merchandise sales - featuring a [relatively limited variety](https://www.facebook.com/OneProductionSingapore/photos/a.166182410148917/1513033885463756/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBrMD-sum-RLsKmsHFnRTiadw07isPyFQeEjMmF1WtOeLAl_23PtkCoq0MU9ya3LCOudrJb5gGY5-s69358g8R2ERHEr0FtURAQ3lBQd9qgtv3ELfkEqIRqkjMBa46YHDtiFQB-_NY-sNR8F7b7nBXFN0DRfj-alzuva-x0RYJvpP7Hmc7hDMjyOyo5NrBxA2euQPF4M-JI6o4kIgMEISLDInQ&amp;__tn__=-R) \- opened at 1pm. I was glad I'd purchased whatever I had to during the global sales on YES24 back in late July, so I could skip this queue. (My purchases arrived in early September, as promised by YES24!) Meanwhile, doors would be opened at 5pm, with the concert starting at 6pm.

I arrived at the venue at 4pm to pick up some fanmade goods which I'd reserved. Now, you could consider this a strange time; it was far too late for me to collect plenty of the much-coveted (free!) fansupport around the venue, yet too early for the doors too. I did manage to collect a fancy Joy banner and some photocards of Irene and Seulgi though! (Sorry Wendy and Yeri!! I just couldn't find anyone by that time, ugh...) After a light dinner, I started queuing to enter the venue around 5.45pm; I got to my seat ten minutes later.

* Apparently talk segment 2 should have gone after All Right, but it went before instead - and was extended for a good amount of time - owing to Joy's injury (more on that soon).
* It seems that the group axed Blue Lemonade due to time constraints? I don't remember hearing it, though I'd appreciate any clarification on this.

*****

**The Concert**

The concert began at 6.05pm! Most of the screams were concentrated here, then mellowed out as everyone, myself included, learnt to conserve our voices (LOL). It took me two whole songs before I finally got used to the idea that I was seeing Red Velvet perform live, before my very eyes, right there and then. As I was relatively far from the stage, I had to alternate between trying to watch all members on the stage and focusing on the LED screens on both sides of the theatre :P I'll attempt to highlight things which I thought were out of the ordinary for me, though I won't discuss the VCRs at length.

I really, really loved the Girl Scout-like outfits from Power Up, and to see the girls perform that song live with that particular set made me happy! During talk segment 1, the members stood in this order, from left to right: Joy, Yeri, Irene, Seulgi and Wendy. They greeted us all (to resounding cheers) then tried to teach us two of the choreography's key points: the opening (banana, banana) and the chorus (yeah yeah, yeah yeah), then remarked that it seemed as if we already knew how to dance those, ha.

The introduction to My Second Date featured solo dances from every member. They performed in the following order: Irene -&gt; Joy -&gt; Yeri -&gt; Wendy -&gt; Seulgi. Obviously, this part was HYPE!

The animal-like outfits which they came out with for Mr. E were pretty cute, but hmm, I wouldn't consider them a favourite of mine :P Then they wore those multicoloured dresses with giant hearts for Lucky Girl - those kinda reminded me of the dresses from Girls' Generation tour in 2013, even as they aren't all that similar.

Since I'm writing about events during the concert in chronological order, I think I'll now have to address the event which came out of left field for us: Joy's injury. eek

* Full disclosure: Joy is my favourite member, and thus I did pay slightly more attention to her at some points earlier in the concert. (I think I saw her stumble slightly during Happiness, but that could just be my brain playing tricks on me, so let's just excuse that...)
* I'm not sure when exactly Joy attained her injury. From the beginning of Bad Dracula though, I noticed that she was constantly a) grabbing onto her right shoulder with her left hand, b) keeping her right arm tucked behind her, (maybe) grabbing at the back of her dress with her right hand and c) not raising this arm like the other members during certain parts of the choreography. I'd thought it could be a wardrobe malfunction - hey, I didn't trust those dresses - but I was worried nonetheless. Then I couldn't immerse myself fully in the performance for the next three minutes because I was wondering what exactly was bothering Joy?
* As Joy rushed backstage immediately once Bad Dracula ended, I yelled ""JOY!!  (gwenchana; ""it's alright"")!!"" Being so far back, I doubt she'd have heard me, but in any case someone from a few rows in front turned around and I wondered for a moment if I'd butchered the pronunciation of the Korean phrase.
* The other four members immediately began talking segment 2, during which they discussed the nickname of the official fan light (""kim-man-bong"", an abbreviation of ""kimchi-mandu (dumpling)-bong""), the name of the robot mascot (""Reve""), their variants of dyed hair and their favourite food in Singapore (""chili crab!!""). Seulgi noted that Joy's shoulder ""hurt"" - I'm sorry I'm unable to recall the exact quote - and asked if we could all wait a while longer, to which we gladly obliged. At some point, Wendy remarked that this concert was becoming more like a fanmeeting, what with the length of this particular talk segment.
* Finally Joy returned to stage, with her head down and her right arm in this blue-grey cast. She announced, with teary eyes, that she would no longer be able to perform for the rest of the evening as she had to go to the hospital asap. As the other members were reassuring, the people in my section started chanting, and the rest of the theatre picked up on that in time.

Joy left the stage after a few moments, and we resumed the concert. I'd say that I was still able to immerse myself in the concert such that I didn't always pay attention to who covered Joy's parts.

All Right was the next song to be performed. It felt strange given the current circumstances, but it couldn't be helped...

The remaining members whipped out their fan lights for About Love! They threw their signed balls to the audience in the stalls too. One member in particular - oh no, I forgot who - was throwing signed balls to a select group of fans in Box A. I'd say I'm envious!

During Moonlight Melody, we waved [paper hearts](https://twitter.com/VELVETSINGAPORE/status/1051464931504095233) given to us by a local fan union for our first fan event.

The VCR which came before Bad Boy was hella creepy... The members did ask us afterwards if we were scared by that. (Wendy: ""Yes? No? I heard three 'no's..."") Well, the outfits for the songs which followed this were SPARKLY and AMAZING. I apologise that I find myself unable to describe them in detail, though I thought Yeri's dress stood out in particular. The shortened ICC snippet which played before Bad Boy gave off creepy vibes too! I can never look at that song the same way again.

Dumb Dumb is my favourite single for a number of reasons (sentimental ones, in part) and I was especially hyped to witness an extended version!! I recall the members doing some cool dance. They talked about the robot key dance during the following talk segment. I think they also mentioned that Joy had already reached the hospital at this time?

Of course Red Flavour and Rookie were superb!! The wait between Rookie, the last song in the main setlist, and the final VCR preceding the encore didn't take as long as I'd expected :P

During talk segment 4, someone in the first row gave the members spoilers for our second event by raising the [banner](https://twitter.com/VELVETSINGAPORE/status/1051464931504095233) given to us in preparation for Day 1: ""Go go Red Velvet! You power up my life!"" They read it aloud and were super happy!! They then talked about their experience from this concert at length. (Some bits I remember: Everyone had a ""GO \[member\]"" chant, to which each member would dance for a few beats. Wendy initially spoke in Korean, then realised she should have been speaking in English, ha! Irene had taken off her in-ear monitor to listen to us sing along to Red Flavor. Also, Irene's speaking voice is real soft...) Everyone would just shout """" whenever the members expressed regret over not being able to perform as five. I hope that we were able to bring the members some comfort with this?

For Day 1, the members waved their fan lights once again as we all raised the aforementioned banner. Someone in the stalls threw a pineapple soft toy onto the stage for Seulgi, and a watermelon soft toy for Irene. It was a sight to behold. LOL

After Day 1, the four members took photos with us all - the audience voted in favour of a ""Peek-A-Boo"" pose - and their backup dancers. They bowed and said ""thank you"" to each part of the theatre, the left, right and center (and the second floor, too!) At long last, the four girls exited stage right.

I didn't check my watch at all during the concert, but I think it likely ended some time past 8.30pm. After the concert ended, I watched the ending credits roll to the tune of My Second Date, then sat through about another three songs blaring on the speakers before I made my exit. (I Just was playing as I was leaving the theatre. How apt, I suppose...)

*****

**Conclusion**

This marks the end of my first K-pop concert ever! It was unexpectedly bittersweet; I finally got to see all five beloved girls in the flesh (and of course this is a dream come true), but I also hate that Joy had to suffer this evening. Of course Irene, Seulgi, Wendy and Yeri did well in covering up the gaps whenever they could; I'm thankful that they worked hard and were able to improvise nicely during these trying circumstances. The members did promise that they'd return for future tours though, so I suppose everyone has that to look forward to.

In other news, I'll be attending IU's concert held at this venue later this December; my seat for dlwlrma happens to be next to my seat for Redmare today. Maybe I'll write a second edition of ""what we saw from the cheap seats""? Well, we'll see!

Thank you for reading this if youve gotten this far! I may edit this for coherency, work on formatting and field questions as best as possible. I could also try and add photos later, though I doubt they add very much in the grand scheme of things. (I didn't try to take photos of the girls, because I thought the risk was too high. They'd come out as potato quality anyway...) Fellow concertgoers, please feel free to correct me where I've gotten something wrong/unclear and write about any notable moment during the concert that I might have missed. Many thanks again!

I got into H.O.T and BoA (shortly after her debut in 2000?) after that and then somehow fell out of Kpop to rediscover it again only a couple years ago with BTS.

I recently read an article about openly gay pop singer Holland.  Im wondering how popular he is in s. Korea or in general recently.  Ive heard that S Korea is still a  fairly homophobic society and its still pretty taboo.  Ive also read that the younger population is more open minded.  So Im just curious. Is he a mainstream artist? And has their been a lot of controversy since he came out? ",3,1

--------------------


####October 21st, 6PM KST 

 TheEastLight.'s Lee Seokcheol and Lee Seunghyun's respond back to Kim Changhwan's allegations of denying abuse and assault [^1](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&amp;aid=0003887222) [^2](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&amp;aid=0001065543)

* It is not true that there has been no further incidents since 1yr 4 months ago (June 13th, 2017). Seunghyun's father demanded that Moon Youngil leave the company. Photographic evidence shows that no parent would ever allow someone like this to continue being with their child.
* On October 4th, Moon Youngil returned to Media Line Entertainment. His return was not brought to the attention of either members of TheEastLight. or their parents. Seunghyun was totally against the idea, it doesn't add up to Kim Changhwan sharing that Seunghyun was kicked.
* By blaming that Lee Seunghyun's attitude was the reason for his departure of the group, doesn't make sense. The personality of someone being abused for 4 years would have likely changed. The issue was Kim Changhwan allowing Moon Youngil to return.
* Audio shared initially which Kim Changhwan claims his words have been distorted is false. It is only natural that with a 6 hour long recording that parts will be edited out.
* The reason why Lee Seokcheol spoke about his brother's abuse instead of Seunghyun at the press conference was due to Seunghyun still being scared. Seunghyun is still receiving physiological care. Seokcheol was driven to share the truth, which is why he shared his brother's abuse.
* Kim Changhwan's statement denying involvement in any abuse or being an accomplice is contradictory. As a CEO, his best interest would have been to keep to his promise and fire Moon Youngil to prevent future violence.
* The reason why other members of TheEastLight. are not coming forward is because they are still under the agency being controlled. In fact, the members may have never had a chance to share their accounts of abuse to their parents, and their parents may have been recently aware.
* Because the other members of TheEastLight. haven't spoken up about the abuse doesn't mean they support the refutes their CEO, Kim Changhwan is making. They might not be able to in their current situation.
* Claiming other members would prove Kim Changhwan's innocence is also strange. We can already see Seunghyun's detailed account of events. Seunghyun was the only one who witnessed something other than Seokcheol and Moon Youngil. (Seunghyun being forced to smoke an e-cigarette).
* Lying that the choking and strangulation with the guitar strings was just 'for fun' to recreate something is impossible. The fact that Seokcheol was caught with visible damage due to the guitar strings and also sharing his pain, is that really 'for fun'?
* Kim Changhwan claiming he doesn't use particular slang (referencing the audio recording) is false, throughout the 6 hour recording you can hear different uses of both slang and phrases to talk down to Seokcheol.
* Kim Changhwan also sharing he wasn't aware of the assault being caused on the 5th floor to Seunghyun is contradictory. If he had learned about the news later and disciplined Moon Youngil, why did the abuse and harassment continue?
* Members were also forced to live on their own without their parents. If a company does this to the members, shouldn't the company step in and become the parental figure?
* Members were all forced to take care of themselves and do things like make their own breakfasts that the company did not provide to them either. If a company is removing a minor from their parent, shouldn't alternatives be made?
* In addition, Seokcheol and Seunghyun will be disputing their contracts with Media Line Entertainment on top of filing for criminal procedures.
* Lee Jeonghyun director/manager for Media Line claims that he was unable to ever hear any form of abuse. Jeonghyun's office was located on the 3rd floor, incidents of abuse occurred on the 5th, but why was Kim Changhwan able to hear the dispute from the 3rd floor also?
* It is also not true that everyone of TheEastLight. would have wanted Moon Youngil to return. Specially not Lee Seokcheol. It would have not made sense for Seokcheol to request favourably for the return of Moon PD if his father was asking Kim Changhwan to fire him.
* There will be determination if Lee Jeonghyun should also be responsible for the crimes shared. As he was most responsible for the members (manager position) and failed to step in. We would also look to see if he violated the Child Protection Act as all members are minors.

I just posted a K-Pop mix on SoundCloud ""K-Pop Dance Party Vol. 1"".

None of my friends or people I know listen to K-Pop but I wanted to share it with some people that might appreciate it!

Please go easy on my djing skills, I've only been djing for about a month and a half so there's a few interesting parts to the mix haha.

Hope you guys enjoy, from one K-Popper to another!

1972,2018-10-22,2018,10,22,3,9q5tp6,Things you noticed after going back and watching a groups early vlives,wjvega,1540146361,"I recently went back and watched some of NCTs first vlives and it was such an informative experience. Seeing clips of them is nothing compared to actually watching the full interactions and seeing how their relationships started to where they are now. I thought this would be a great topic for others to share their own experiences too and see what they picked up. For me:

127
 NCTs group dynamic of always being extremely supportive and rarely making fun of each other was a thing since literally their first live. They clap and cheer almost every time after a member answers a question (especially a foreign member) and its always earnest. They still do this to this day lol
 Since WinWin was the 1st member who wasnt great at Korean to debut they all babied him so much. They always made sure to include him in everything and encouraged him to talk in Chinese when he didnt know how to say something
 While Taeyong was much more quiet and serious his actual cute, awkward personality is still pretty obvious. The cold, intimidating image is so obviously not him

Dream
 People always bring up WinWins struggles but Chenle literally didnt speak or understand any Korean in their 1st few lives. He would just stand there (adorably smiling) until Renjun would translate for him and would answer him in Chinese, and then go back to just chilling
 This wouldve been a really stressful situation for most people but it didnt seem to bother Chenle or the other dreamies at all. He was still his very cheerful self and didnt seem out of place.
 The fact that Renjun joined late/wasnt in SM Rookies so he had to balance getting to know the members while also looking after Chenle and translating everything for him, when he was only 16, is amazing 
 Their group dynamic of being the chaotic, funny group that has the strongest bond between members (IMO) is also evident very quickly even with the big language barrier 
 They were so obsessed with those hover boards theres at least 5 separate lives of them just doing dumb things with them 

Would love to hear about things other people picked up from their favorite groups early days!",0,1

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**TRISS Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_triss_01/)

* Date Project Ends: October 31, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is TRISS?

Triss is a four member band signed to Unique Tunes. The band styles themselves as a synthpop band ""who combines 80s synthpop with the imagination of sci-fi movies"".

The group debuted in 2016 with the single album *\[ice cream\].* Their most recent comeback was in 2018 with the mini album [*\[science and fantasy\]*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLSbHxSGIps)*.*

They have an active [Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/BandTriss/)

[**SOYA Mini Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_soya_01/)

* Date Project Ends: October 31, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Soya?  


Soya is a soloist signed to GH Entertainment. She initially debuted as part of a co-ed duo *Soya n' sun* under 101 Entertainment. However, the duo only lasted around eight months before she debuted as a soloist. *Soya n' sun* would eventually be disbanded in 2012.

She is the niece of Turbo's Kim Jongkook, and thus was able to get him to feature on her debut track as a soloist, titled ""[  (I Love You Everyday)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kc7hqZVscU).

She eventually left 101 Entertainment in 2014, moving the Urban Works (the home of Produce48's Kim Minju and soloist Kriesha Chu). At Urbran Works, she mostly featured on other artists' albums and didn't seem to have released solo material at this time. She would later leave the label in 2017 and move to GH Entertainment, her current home.

She auditioned for *The Unit* with the song ""Firework"" (I'm assuming the Katy Perry track) though her audition went unaired. She got 6 superboots and moved onto the live rounds, where she would eventually rank #46 before being eliminated.

At GH Ent, she has been releasing a ""SOYA Color Project"" over a period of time culminating in this release, which is Volume 4 of the series. Her most recent comeback was with the song ""[Arist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjCzp_mMkVE)"", off the mini album of the same name.

She has various active SNS pages, which you can access by clicking [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soya_(singer))

[**Hash Tag Mini Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hashtag_01/)

* Date Project Ends: November 12, 2018

Who is Hash Tag?

Hash Tag is a seven member girl group signed to Luk Factory. They debuted in October 2017 with the song ""[Hue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlYtS-fXKnk)"". They are notably produced by former Baby V.O.X member Kan Mi Youn.

There's not too much written about them in English outside the typical idol facts, but some notable things include:

* Dajeong competed on the first season of *Produce 101*, though she was cut relatively early, ranking #62 in the competition. Her most notable performance was as part of Group 2's performance of Miss A's ""[Bad Girl Good Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwqda79wPec)"".
* Member Sua had a small role in the popular K-Drama *My Love from the Star.*

The group also have various [SNS pages](https://kprofiles.com/hashtag-members-profile/).

[**The Rose Special Photobook Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose_3/)

* Date Project Ends: November 16, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is The Rose?

The Rose is a 4 male rock band from J&amp;Star Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXcpLWB2eBA)"". According to OneHallyu, the group writes, composes, and arranges their own songs. The groups name is said to come from the idea that there are many different color roses, so the group wants to be like a rose and show off many different musical colors. The fandom name is Black Rose.

The group previously ran [two very successful Makestars](https://www.makestar.co/projects?brandIdx=9) to fund their previous albums, grossing 1305.1% and 618.9% respectively.

The Rose's most recent comeback was earlier this month, with the song ""[She's in the Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfucEdhdo8U)"" off their second mini-album *Dawn*. However, due to recent controversy over the use of SHINee's Jonghyun's personal instagram photos without getting permission caused the MV to be deleted, with J&amp;Star Ent offering an apology for the error.

While I couldnt verify the information, the info section of the groups OH thread says that Doojoon, Jaehyeong, and Hajoon met via busking (they started performing under the name Windfall), and Woosung was offered the chance to join by Doojoon due to hearing about his music skills via a mutual friend. Funnily enough, Woosung was a trainee at J&amp;Star preparing for a solo debut, but brought up the band concept to the labels CEO, and after a successful performance by the 4 members, the CEO signed the remaining 3 and formed The Rose.

Then fans noticed that it was a clickbait because no one really uses the term ""GFriend"" in the Korean scene except the girl group GFriend.  (or girlfriend) is a common word but the fans smell something fishy because like I said earlier, ""GFriend"" only use by the girl group GFriend in all of Korean media outlets.

Now to tighten up the accusation, the song [(Gfriend)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ6avtkfCq8) has sexually explicit lyrics (you can see it [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqCuOyQXQAI64cj.jpg:large)). Even without translations (because most of them are in English), you can see that it really has lewd stuff.

Now, Verbal Jint is aware of this issue and wrote an apology letter on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpNrmvWgFoS/?taken-by=freevjfreevj) and quote:

&gt; I would like to apologize for the song that I released yesterday. I am inspired by Young Thug's 'Jeffery' where he put celebrities' name in his album. I apologize to GFriend's fans for failing to give quick feedback &amp; will change the title of the song asap.

So yeah, he means of using ""GFriend"" in the song title. Hope he changes it real soon.",7,1

Go listen to your country's music"" kind of way. I'm curious why people love music that they mostly cannot understand(Again, I don't mean this in a bad way). I lived in the states for about 2 years, so I like to think that I can speak/understand English quite fluently. But Korean isn't a very ""easy to learn"" language, and you really can't learn it anywhere other than in Korea. So I'm assuming that you guys can't speak Korean like I do(I'm Korean, as my username DanielHongFromKr suggests). And most Kpop songs have very little to no English, so it's not like you guys can understand most of it, so why do you guys listen to ""Korean Music?"" I'm going to assume that it's for the well made M/V's/pretty Idols, but lots of people leave comments about the ""lyrics"" being so good. Maybe you guys watch the ""Korean-English"" lyric videos which re-writes the Korean lyrics into English Syllables. I don't know. Feel free to answer down in the comments section. 

I'm just curious.

Music is your passion and you want to be a successful k-pop group. So what kind of success you would want as an artist if you can only have one from:

Physical Sales: It means you have a dedicated fandom, fans who are willing to buy multiple versions of your albums, stream on charts etc. to support your group (fans doesn't know you are rich).Fandom loves your music and everything you do but general public doesn't care about you or your music.

Digital Sales: You have strong awareness among general public, more people have your music on their devices but they are not dedicated fans, will not buy your albums and might not turn up to your concerts. 

So what kind of success you want? Since you don't want money would you still do concerts? Why? Why not?

Should the more vocally capable members get more lines and the weaker members get less?

On one hand, if the lines get distributed equally then it could put some strain on a member with weaker vocals and lead to higher chance for them to mess up in a performance. It also takes lines away from a more capable vocalist in the group who could showcase their vocals they worked hard for. But, a lot of them get their fair share of attention.

The interviewer asked the boys (I think this must've been an earlier interview, not too far from when the boys just debuted) how long they envisioned their first kisses would be: 

(Nb - the following isn't verbatim)

Boo: about five minutes

Seok: about five seconds, because it would be awkward at first, then probably go in for a second one. Aahh, Hoshi hyung seems to really like this question. 

Soon ^An ^Intellectual : ... (You can hear giddy giggles as he replies) I'd just keep going.

Another time, I think this was on AfreecaTV? When they were asking how many kids the boys wanted and S.coups mentioned about 4 I think (I think he wanted more girls too) and the members were like oh wow, are you sure you can handle that? 

SeungCheol - I can handle 12 of you, you think I can't handle 4 kids? 

I'm thinking it's in the same Video, the question is directed to Hoshi (someone correct me if I'm wrong). 

Hoshi - I'll just keep going/working hard. 

(When I watched these videos my korean was worse than it is now and I was a fairly new carat so I'm going wholly on what I remember from english subs - so please correct me if I'm wrong)

2164,2018-10-23,2018,10,23,16,9qmtmq,(CLARIFICATION) BIGBANG isn't the best-selling BOYBAND of all-time in History,ReiKaSen,1540281588,"There need to be a clarification about Bigbang being the best selling boyband in the world. Some time ago, a certain user posted about it in this sub regarding that, so i thought we should debunked it to be honest, because it keep spreading everywhere on the internet

Here, a thread posted by some user a while a go on this sub : [https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6lktt0/bigbang\_now\_the\_biggest\_selling\_boyband\_in\_history/?utm\_source=amp&amp;utm\_medium=comment\_header](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6lktt0/bigbang_now_the_biggest_selling_boyband_in_history/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=comment_header) 

&amp;#x200B;

It was on Onehallyu, and this is where the rumor began to spread honestly : [https://onehallyu.com/topic/537517-bigbang-are-the-best-selling-boy-band-in-history/](https://onehallyu.com/topic/537517-bigbang-are-the-best-selling-boy-band-in-history/)

&amp;#x200B;

It was also on Allkpop : [https://www.allkpop.com/forum/threads/the-best-selling-boy-band-in-history.102875/](https://www.allkpop.com/forum/threads/the-best-selling-boy-band-in-history.102875/)

&amp;#x200B;

These false informations have spread to Twitter as well, like NO. I like Bigbang but they are not the best selling Boyband in world. They are not even the best selling artist in Korea, their records sales on Oricon and Gaon (\*\*You can actually check these 2 valid sources for facts\*\*) didn't even cracked 6 Million sales. Why did people let slide these false info, the fact that it was on this sub is mind-boggling me. The rumor spread from a forum called Onehallyu, a place filled with wrong-given infos. Wonder why did people take it seriously, it even reached a couple of articles out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

If they were true, the Guinness World Record, Oricon, and Billboard would have published an article about the achievement, but they are not. It's as simple as that. These false information also stated that SISTAR, SNSD and IU sold more records than Spice Girls, AKB48 and Hikaru Utada......... EEHHHH?????? Are we seriously going to label the likes of IU as the best selling soloist artist in Asia over the likes of Ayumi Hamasaki and Utada? I hope this will clarify things, i like Kpop but lets not spread false informations just for the sake of hyping your favourite artists

4. JYJ- My biggest concern is what is even happening with JYJ? I guess we wont know til Junsu is discharged but I do not think that YC will be joining them if they even have a comeback. But can JYJ go on as just JJ and Junsu? Would they even want to continue without YC?? So many questions so little time.. ",378,1

Its called Something New where someone lists the group they follow the closest and people have to respond with groups they think OP would like!

For example: I love Twice and so I would comment Twice and then others would respond with groups they think I would like! Whether that be because of personality similarities, similar discographies, etc.

The reason Im posting this is hopefully to help people find new groups to follow or check out because, frankly, that can be rather hard to do on your own. I hope everyone can join and help others find new gems! (This is also an awesome way to help promote groups who are rather nugu as well!~)",20,1

\- Aegyo should die, its cringy and gross. This is not saying that cute concepts are bad, it is just aegyo, grown ass people acting like babies, that I find extremely uncomfortable.

\- Idols shouldnt do fan service or other weird things that require them to act like a boyfriend/girlfriend to their fans. I think a huge part of the concept of kpop is based off of fans wanting to date their idols, which i think is super toxic and creates delusional fans.

\- Singing &gt; dancing. Music is about the MUSIC, and i know a huge part of kpop is dancing , but when idols are performing live, i would prefer them to have better vocals and sacrifice some of their dancing over lip syncing.

\- The industry standard must be higher. Just look at Produce 48, all of those horribly trained people who were in F or D all improved somewhat so that they could sing and dance decently w/out sticking out. I personally get annoyed when a successful/debuted idol who could NOT sing/dance at all gets praised for improving, when in reality they shouldnt have debuted at all until they were ready and had the skills i wont name any names though bc i will get downvoted to hell

\- Lastly, cute concepts are not inferior to badass/dark concepts!!!!!!!",3,1

The music video really added to the whole mystique-aesthetic as well.


 What other songs have made you feel like you're just constantly ascending, or have the wistful longing? I'm talking K-Pop, K-HipHop, K-R&amp;B, anything!

Good examples of this would be [Oh My Girl's *Closer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk), [Dean's *D (Half Moon)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eelfrHtmk68), or for a faster paced song, [SHINee's *Good Evening*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dGwk5-QMpc).

* Doctors say even if the kid does wake up, s/he will have the mind of a 3-4 year old as the child is brain dead 
* The school isn't doing anything to help because the incident involves primary students, and the perpetrator hasn't been disciplined
* Parents of perpetrator's were also snickering and talking outside the ICU, while the victim was admitted
* Hoon's family doesn't know what to do with the current situation
* Hoon is hoping that with media coverage, the school is able to take action

One of the biggest things I saw was that a lot of people thought they would be talentless without Sejeong and Yeonjoung, but damn IOI really proved everyone wrong. All of the girls with the exception of 2 or 3 (debatable) of them could actually sing pretty well and were stable while all of them could dance well too besides Sohye. Like especially when Whatta Man came out, the underrated members really blew everyone away. Thinking about it just makes me sad though since IOI is gone now but oh well",10,1

I don't really know why. It might be that I just feel that it would be overwhelming to commit to paying attention to Japanese releases too or maybe its because the songs tend to have a different feel compared to Korean releases. 


The only ones I actually do know and like are [BIGBANG's Tell Me Goodbye](https://youtu.be/GE_4RtpVVaw), [D-LITE's (Daesung's) Rainy Rainy](https://youtu.be/TsK6f5lxucs), and [Girl's Generation's Paparazzi](https://youtu.be/IUqP1xzRZkw). 

I'm curious, do you guys tend follow and enjoy the Japanese releases of groups as much as their Korean releases? And what are some of your favorite Japanese releases? I'm more curious about songs solely or originally released in Japanese, but if you think that certain songs re-released in Japanese sound better than the original, I'd be interested in hearing about those too.",69,1

YES or YES is a song that only TWICE can sing. It is a colorpop genre, a bouncy and bright song. This new song will instantly stick ""its a good song"" in ears. We are that confident, no further explaination needed.

Translation: 


Dear Danjjaks,

Hi, this is Hyeyeon.

It has been some time, I'm sorry for being late [with an update]. As my company has already shared the news, I will no longer be a member of gugudan, but I will join and be a Danjjak who will always continue to support gugudan. After a long decision, while on my hiatus contemplating, while I was focusing on both my studies and health.

Thanks to Danjjak, I have been able to focus in my academics, and I am also recovering well. I am grateful for all the memories I have been able to create with Danjjak. I was able to share precious moments with Danjjak by my side, who got to see me grow/gain experience~ This will be a time of my life I will never forget and always cherish~! I will never forget and always remember all the times spent with Danjjak, which are the most precious to me!

I will continue to focus on both my health and academics, and will be completing my activities with gugudan. I hope to give a proper goodbye.

Please continue to cheer on all the eonnies of gugudan, as they continue to show a more beautiful side of them. I too will support gugudan as a Danjjak. I hope to meet you all soon.

Thank you Danjjak, I love you.

Sincerely, Hyeyeon

I think OMG might have gotten their first win quicker if they had some type of promotions in Autumn/Winter 2016. They had an amazing start to the year with Liar Liar, Step By Step, Windy Day and A-ing but with JinE going on hiatus and the rest of the group not doing any promotions I think they lost a lot of ground. Especially as Red Velvet, Twice and Gfriend started to really dominate. Also in 2017 they only had one comeback which again didn't help them.

CLC just needed consistent concepts (probably more like No oh oh) and good backing with their re-debut. The Eunbin situation probably didn't help either.",31,1

1st Gen: debuted pre 2000
2nd Gen: debuted 2000-2010
3rd Gen: debuted 2010-present

I was inspired to create this thread after seeing a Gaon sales infographic that was posted in this subreddit.

I feel like K-pop truly and undeniably became a global phenomenon in the 3rd gen period as seen with groups with huge popularity such as Twice, BTS, and EXO. As such I think it's safe to assume that a majority of new K-pop fans are mostly only familiar with such groups. What are some 1st and 2nd gen artists / groups that you think deserve a lot more popularity, in this period when K-pop has never been bigger? These can be both active and inactive!

For me, I do wish BoA was more popular. With 18 years in the industry, she's the undisputed goddess of K-pop, but her fanbase is older and not the type to be faithfully streaming their fave's MV and buying their album, so her sales and views sadly aren't stellar. She's released iconic tracks like My Name and Valenti, but some of my favourite songs by her that are more recent are:

1. One Shot, Two Shot
2. Everybody Knows
3. Nega Dola
4. Jazzclub
5. Manhattan Tango
6. Lookbook
7. Woman
8. I want you back

BoA is a QUEEN that deserves so much more recognition and popularity! She just had a comeback a couple days ago with her 9th album WOMAN.

I hope this thread encourages newer fans to explore more of this amazing genre that is K-pop!! ",24,1

2468,2018-10-26,2018,10,26,1,9rbxc4,What are some 1st / 2nd gen artists / groups that are worth checking out?,chiyosayuri,1540485409,"[Mod told me that discussions about underrated things are banned, so I've amended this post and resubmitted it.]

For those unfamiliar with the generations, generally:
1st Gen: debuted pre 2000
2nd Gen: debuted 2000-2012
3rd Gen: debuted 2012-present (this is debatable though)

I was inspired to create this thread after seeing a Gaon sales infographic that was posted in this subreddit.

I feel like K-pop truly and undeniably became a global phenomenon in the 3rd gen period as seen with groups with huge popularity such as Twice, BTS, and EXO. As such I think it's safe to assume that a majority of new K-pop fans are mostly only familiar with such groups. Worse still, a few of them disrespect 1st and 2nd gen groups as inferior while knowing nothing about them.

What are some 1st and 2nd gen artists / groups that you think people should give more attention to, in this period when K-pop has never been bigger? These can be both active and inactive! If you wish you can include a few song recommendations 

For me: BoA for sure. With 18 years in the industry, she's the undisputed goddess of K-pop, but her fanbase is older and not the type to be faithfully streaming their fave's MV and buying their album, so her sales and views sadly aren't stellar. She's released iconic tracks like My Name and Valenti, but some of my favourite songs by her that are more recent are:

1. One Shot, Two Shot
2. Everybody Knows
3. Nega Dola
4. Jazzclub
5. Manhattan Tango
6. Lookbook
7. Woman
8. I want you back

BoA is a QUEEN that deserves so much more recognition and popularity! She just had a comeback a couple days ago with her 9th album WOMAN.

I hope this thread encourages newer fans to explore more of this amazing genre that is K-pop!! ",63,1

I just can't get this song out of my head. I feel like these guys deserve more recognition. They, as well as other kpop artists, deserve the fame and success in the USA as BTS. We need more mainstream music that is diverse.

2551,2018-10-26,2018,10,26,21,9rkfms,For all those 90s,ooii0iioo,1540558231,"So yesterday I watched the latest episode of New Journey to the West with Kang Ho Dong and they had a ""Guess the song"" challenge and 2AM and Lessang's song came on. It made me fking nostalgic thinking back to when 2AM was killing the charts and Running Man's heyday when Lessang's music would blast all over an episode whenever the Monday couple would do something. It go me to thinking that us 90's kids(adults now) have been through a lot in the last couple years. 

We went through this phase where every week we were wondering wether or not Running Man was going to be cancelled due to bad ratings. I'm telling you guys, my life during highschool was an episode of Running Man every week, always at the same time. Then Gary left and this made me sad as shit. Now Infinity Challenge has been cancelled(?), hopefully it returns as a seasonal variety show or Kim Tae Ho goes to TVN and brings back all the members for a new show like how Na PD did with all the old 1n2d members.

We also went through the disband of 2ne1 and basically SNSD will never be the same. Kara is gone. We saw the popularity of T-ara die due to the bully scandal. Kim Hyun Joong's abuse scandal. Super Junior rarely promotes anymore. Where tf is 2PM? And many more shit. You guys dont have to agree with me but when 2ne1 and SNSD disbanded/group members left to different agencys I took that as the end to an era, my era of kpop. The one that shaped me as a person today.

2555,2018-10-26,2018,10,26,22,9rky8v,Underrated musical/career trajectories in kpop,dgplr,1540562235,"I was just having NCT Dream marathon (cause obviously), and I was just really amazed that in such a short time, their music has  had such variations in terms of musical styles and an actual trajectory from the juvenile fun of 'Chewing gum' to reaching puberty and experiencing attraction and love in 'My First and last' mini to the confidence and for rebellion in 'Go' and finally to celebration of youth and brotherhood(and of course young love-I see you 'Dripping' lol). The group dynamics, their music and mvs really show the scope of the pains of growing up and youth and what it really means and entails.

Of course they aren't the first or the last group to ever tackle the theme of youth, but the fact that it is very likely they have lived the experiences described in their album when they were working on the album/ when the album was released like creating mischief, first crushes, first heartbreak, the need to break free and rebel, brotherhood,learning to toughen up and be able to say goodbye(ot7) and the fact that they are literally growing up from spunky, bright boys to mature, talented men in front of our eyes is I think so special and wonderful and it feels like I am also part of their youth.

I hope with the addition of the new rookies, they can keep exploring the different facets of youth, it would be cool if they apprached the theme of first relationship or something like that for the next lp/ep. 

Yo Dream, jjereo, jjereo hey!!!

2598,2018-10-27,2018,10,27,14,9rruof,Keeping up with K-Pop is like a full-time job.,Wolf_Puppy,1540617223,"Back when I first got into K-Pop in 2001, we had to scour the web to just find any videos of anything, let alone subbed versions. Now, we have a shit ton of new content every single day, with no break, no rests, like a freight train that just barrels ahead. Even if you just stan one artist/group it's already pretty insane how much content is released--especially a popular one. There are social media posts, teasers, MVs, variety show appearances, reality shows, fan meet cams, fancams, music show performances, fan-created content, etc. If you stan multiple artists/groups then it becomes a full-time job just to keep up with all the new content every single day. Add to all that there are fan communities where you have discussion and debates that take up even more of your time, and I can't even imagine those of you who like to do K-Pop covers--that's even more time dedicated to K-Pop.

It's both a blessing and a curse. Because there's so much content, K-Pop forces my other forms of entertainment to the wayside due to the ""be in the know/moment"" nature of K-Pop culture, so I don't watch nearly as many movies and TV shows or play games like I once did. Is it like this for the rest of you too? ",92,1

2654,2018-10-28,2018,10,28,10,9rzfa6,Dance moves you find funny even though they're not supposed to be?,caralyn7,1540688646,"For example: I always get a kick out of choreography featuring weird finger movements. I was super into the dance for iKon's Killing Me, but then they did the finger shake for the ""no no no"" part and I just started laughing. The same for Everybody by SHINee, when they wiggle their fingers in the chorus. And also the iconic beginning the Lucifer, with their arms. You know what I'm talking about.

I also don't know why this is so funny to me, but whenever all but one member drops to the floor while one stands for their part like in BTS's Blood, Sweat, and Tears and Monsta X's Fighter (I believe the exact moments are when V has his part and when Kihyun marches out between the members doing that leg thing on the floor). I get that these moments are supposed to be all serious and ""Let's show off our sexy legs"" but they just make me laugh for some reaction. 

I don't really find any girl group dance moves unintentionally funny because I think in general they aren't as self-serious and angsty as the boys (which is totally not a bad thing, because about 80% of the boys out there these days are going through emo phases with ""complicated"" storylines and dances because they know that that's what sells while the girls have been more diverse), but I have noticed that a lot of the girls these days are doing these similar hand movements around the eye. The best way I can describe it is that they're like, curling their fingers around their eye. Eg: Taeyeon in her Station song with Melomance, and then Oh!GG were all doing it in Lil Touch MV. Then Binnie did it during the second verse in Remember Me. It doesn't make laugh, per say, but it's an interesting gesture to see in a lot of videos.",157,1

2692,2018-10-28,2018,10,28,23,9s3jsg,yet another 2018 awards/daesang prediction post,intronevermind,1540737070,"I know there's a sizeable bunch of such posts out there already, but I thought I would consolidate all major award show predictions in one post just to see how accurate they would turn out to be. Although, I must say that most categories are fairly predictable at this point. 

Also, I will try to be as objective as possible, based on data and comebacks that we have had so far. My knowledge of K solo acts is limited, so I am only touching upon categories that groups usually snatch. Just a reminder that all groups are deserving, yes, but the winner is always the best among the rest, both subjectively and objectively. Besides, award shows in Korea don't always work according to expectations so anything is possible at the end of the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

**MBC** **Genie Awards** (because they are just around the corner). 

1. Artist of the Year: **BTS**
2. SOTY- **IKON/Black Pink/Twice**
3. Best Selling Artists: **BTS** because they ARE the best selling artists. Wannaone might win if Genie is not too intent on giving out multiple daesangs to a single awardee. 
4. Digital Album of the Year: **BTS/Wannaone/IKON**

The artist and song genre categories are all toss-ups right now. I am guessing everyone attending will win something. Gidle has a chance at female ROTY while there are a lot of candidates for male ROTY (multiple winners, perhaps?)

&amp;#x200B;

**Asia Artist Awards:**

There's just one Daesang here and that's going to **BTS**.

Since this show is notorious for giving out ridiculously named attendance awards, expect attendees to win some category or the other. We have everything from Best Star to Best Icon award. We may see someone winning Best Icon award for having the most well-ironed outfits, or the most bedazzling, heart-melting smile of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

**MAMAs:**

1. AROTY: **BTS**. ~~And the award will be presented to them during the finale like they have always deserved, given AROTY IS the biggest award of the night.~~ 
2. ALOTY: **BTS**. They win even when their album sales are not combined. 
3. SOTY: **Twice** for sure. Momoland might have a chance but I don't see them winning a daesang this year. I might be wrong though. 
4. Best Boy Group: **Wannaone** (If BTS win this, there's a chance they won't get the double daesang).
5. Best Girl Group: **Twice/GFriend/Momoland** 
6. Best Choreo: **Seventeen and Gfriend**
7. World Performer/Worldwide artist: **GOT7/Monsta X**
8. Best New Artist: This one's a bit tricky but **Stray Kidz and G idle/Loona** have equal chances here.

**Note:** double daesang seems like both an impossibility and not. There are many who believe Wannaone might snatch a daesang this year but BTS is too big and their achievements, unparalleled. They took the world by a storm and have the best selling album of 2018 both in terms of physical sales and digital points. Nevertheless, there might be a possibility of having surprise winners. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Melon Music Awards:**

1. AROTY: **BTS**
2. ALOTY: **BTS** (Best digital points of 2018 so far. Even their b-sides from Tear are still charting on melon + the global impact of their album and songs).
3. SOTY: **IKON/BP/Twice** (Soty is tricky this year. Anyone out of these three can win. Besides, we also have solo artists like IU so this category will see some cutthroat competition). 
4. Global Artists ""Daesang"" (if they are giving one out this year): **BTS** again.
5. Best New Artist: **G idle** is snatching this one lads. They performed the best digitally (especially on melon) amongst the rookies. Also, we might have more than one winner this time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Seoul Music Awards:**

1. Daesang: **BTS**
2. Record of the Year/Best album: **BTS** for Tear
3. Record of the Year in digital release: **IKON for LS**
4. New Artists: I think there are usually multiple winners for this so lots of possibilities here. **G idle/Loona/SKZ/The Boyz**

&amp;#x200B;

**Golden Disk Awards:** 

1. Album Daesang: **BTS**
2. Digital SOTY: **IKON/Black Pink**
3. ROTY: **Loona/Stray Kidz**

Im not a huge BTS fan but Ive been following the BTS concert in Singapore and its a mess right now with people reselling tickets up to $13000SGD(approx $10000USD) each, and some people do buy them(esp desperate fans).

2716,2018-10-29,2018,10,29,1,9s4i0j,Why does Kyle Lai-Fatt looks so much different than the other KPop singers?,Lovelyamywinehouse,1540744508,"Somewhere deep in the Hollywood Hills, Kyle Lai-Fatt, 43, opened his audience up to facets of his life previously unknown. Months prior, Mollie Sue Gondi, another model was under heavy scrutiny for name calling on KLF.She was then given a platform for which she could make herself accountable and provide insight on thetumultuous affair last month.

In spite of his serval scandals, Kyle Lai-Fatt has prevailed as the King of Hollywood.If you arent already aware, Lai-Fatt has been receiving a significant amount of traction on his songs. It began with him opening up to his audience about his past. This has slowly developed into more detailed information that featured people from a wide range of lifestyles.

As I quickly described before, KLF revealed his truth to his stans with his songs gaining the most popularity. It was broken down into six weeks with KLF being compared to BTS' Jimin, Jungkook, Rap Monster and Suga, left fans stunned as their eyes were opened to Lai-Fatt's extremely luxurious home(which is an understatement).Am I dreaming? And if I'm not, I will pack everything up for the mornings,Lai-Fatt giving out the best advice after only getting a small glimpse of the life and instantly the audience was able to connect with him.In his life, Lai-Fatt was born as Kyle Ricardo Lai-Fatt on December 10, 1974 in Winter Park, Florida. He is 6'10 tall and weights 255 pounds. He worked with Visual Concepts Entertainment, Inc. You can get him in a cheat code for any 2K game. After getting a rivalry with Justin Timberlake and EXO's Kai, Lai-Fatt detailed his troubles as a man who doesnt conform to the expected conventions of genderneutral people as well as his heartbreaking and well known short-lived career as a video game engineer.He maybuild off of the last as he continues to live like a KPop star. Here we finally start to understand Lai-Fatt's success and the ins and outs of his music career, is the most candid of them all. We travel to Lai-Fatt's old apartment where they discuss his worst moments and his rows with self-harm.

What is it that people love about it all? I suspect that it stems from the evident genuineness that is displayed by KLF. While taking on the aspects of a new low acting career, many of KLF'S songs give off the feel of a workout. But the fact is that workout arent synonymous with reality. Too often they are scripted with producers pushing false narratives. But KLF is different. The honesty established in his songs bridges a relationship amongst himself and his audience, called the Lai-Fattheads, which is why I think these songs are so loved.

So whats next for Lai-Fatt? Its been about a week since he has released a song: a duet with Natasha Bedingfield and fans have been patiently awaiting the arrival of his new platinum album.Recently its been rumoured that this new album will cover his life as a KPop singer and former video game engineer, who has for some time now gained a lot of notoriety for his method of operating.

With this recent tweet, Lai-Fatt has thrown his fans for a loop. A tour has not been released but when that day comes, I can only assume that viewers will be stunned and eager for more.

The skys the limit. With 60 million+ views on his last other songs, I can only foresee an upward trend. YouTube and Vevo has its limits and with KLF constantly evolving, I can hardly fathom the idea of him sticking to it. Many have proposed the idea of a Netflix original starring Lai-Fatt. While I know that starting a show is difficult, I truly believe that Lai-Fatt has the potential to grow from just a KPop star in training. Lets begin with the editing which is done by both Lai-Fatt and his brother, Kurt. When listening to his songs, its evident that everything is done with thought; this ranges from smooth transitions to montages that emphasize scenes and even jump cuts that are necessary and dont feel obnoxious. The content of his songs is also striking. When playing Korean Pop music, we might find ourselves asking the question does this having any substance? With Lai-Fatt's songs, we dont have to get to that question. With a blend of dramatic speech and satire, Lai-Fatt calls attention to many social issues, mental and physical health. So what do you think? Should Lai-Fatt remain on your top 10 favorite male KPop singers of all time or should he surpass that and move to the TV screen, where he belongs?",2,1

Thanks to them, viewers have gotten an in-depth look into Kyle Lai-Fatt and Natasha Bedingfield's Too Good at Goodbyes, what it takes to transform into the camera ready version we see on social media, and what its like to walk a mile in his shoes. Right smack dab in the middle of the series a plagiarism report war might be brewing. Unfortunately it was copyright infringement from BTS.



After getting a glimpse of two songs which could easily be mistaken for millions of views, KLF couldnt help but inquire about his infamous income. He quickly revealed he makes about a $10 million a year. Fans were furious and felt that Too Good at Goodbyes was a copy of Whailein 52! Listen to the beginning and it sounded familiar!

KLF was shocked at the criticism he received and felt it wasnt any different from his usual line of questioning.

Hey guys, Im not trying to screw with BTS' video? Are yall on meth! It just randomly took us to shoot with Natasha yesterday so I uploaded it today. asked her the most basic of questions that I literally ask EVERYBODY [my Lai-Fattheads] and posted today! Im sorry if you think its anything more than that but its not. Love BTS definitely wouldnt do anything to purposely screw with them or their content!! And dont worry BTS' songs will be A LOT more informative than this 50-second clip I included of him

Of course, my ears were wide open when Kyle revealed his income but it only made me want to peek into his life even more! Something about his platinum hair, freckles, and his jaw-dropping accessories and shoe collection keep me glued to Kyle's social media pages waiting for the next update.",9,1

I was listening to this [Weki Meki - Crush](https://youtu.be/P1FLT0dtqcE?t=69) instrumental and cracked up at like 1:35 when the organ sound comes on. Sounds like one of the bad recorder playing songs or something. I linked at 1:10 so you can get into the groove of the rest of the song. I think a lot of the humor is that it's so sudden and out-of-place. It works [just fine](https://youtu.be/bT2AMc8hI6A?t=106) with the vocals, but the attack is so silly on its own.


My absolute favorite example of this is at 1:55 in the officially-released [Kara - Jumping instrumental](https://youtu.be/v5aMEkg4WZY?t=100). The rest of the instrumental is such a jam (I also linked early for this). Even after 8 years (wow is it really that long?), this one always has me laughing out loud, like how did this make it into an official production? It sounds so weird. Honestly, it doesn't sound much more normal [with vocals](https://youtu.be/SweXhOQPMdM?t=124), but it's way less noticeable.

.
.
.
I enjoy k-pop,but some might think other things. The music is good,and i believe the people are good too.
.
.
The problem i have with it is that the idols have way too much pushed on them,and being treated poorly when they should be treated with a lot of respect. They don't get that much time to do anything rather then work. 24/7 they have to work to be the best,and i mean the top groups might be treated better then the smaller groups. They have to work hard for the fans,but i believe they should take time to do it for themselves.
.
.
With K-pop people have totally different opinions on dating. I believe if they want to date they should be aloud to because it's better for them to be happy rather then being sad,and I don't care if you might say, ""If he dates someone then how will i ever get my oppa unu,"" I mean come on you are probably underage. If they want to be in a relationship they should be aloud. Also,South Korea doesn't accept LGBT+ as well as other places,so i believe if an idol is gay they should be able to say they are.

Im thinking Music Bank since SM artists apparently arent promoting on Mnet anymore? 

But excluding November, I thought Mnet had the most top groups going on its program, just because of the production value of those videos they put out lol.

I know some channels do reactions or ""reviews"" but due to the toxic nature of many kpop fandoms they just suck off the artists and have very few negative opinions,

i know ocasionally people like form of therapy will say they didnt like something

The closest ive found is reacttothek with the classical musicians being more vocal but its still just reactions and the negative things they say are usually critiques from an experienced and studied musician. 

There used to be a channel called mrjkpop or something like that but the dude sent some questionable flirty msg to a minor and bye bye youtube career. I did use to like his reviews cos he was honest at least, even if he had his biases (even so, it was still reaction even if he watched them twice)

Even on this sub negative consensus on music are rare as fuck outside of unpopular opinions threads

My point is id love if there was or is some fearless someone that would nonchalantly review kpop like anthony fantano does for general music (love the 3 times hes talked or reviewes kpop)

I know some fans dont mind critisism but lets be honest, the loudest groups of kpop fans do

Tldr: i want someone to review kpop for real, without minding the fan backlash as kpop fandoms are mostly unacostumbed to serious critiques, does someone like that exist?

I was listening my k-pop playlist on Spotify and was curious to know about your all time favorite k-pop songs, the ones you've been listening for years (or months) and still feels like the first day. Are they from your favorite groups/singers? Do they have a special meaning to you? Some of mine:

&amp;#x200B;

But then a friend turned me onto Jungkook's different cover song recordings, and I fell in love with how earnestly he enjoys continuously challenging himself as a singer. (I feel the same way about Pentagon's Jinho! I love me some vocal kings!) Then I stumbled across one of J-Hope's V Live and I found his direct way of talking to his fans while eating convenience store ramyun in his around-the-house-wear to be really endearing and funny. Now I've found myself really cheering them on.

I'm a huge fan of when the 2 verses in a song differ from each other in some way. This could be achieved by for example beginning with a rap part on the 2nd verse (Ice Cream Cake -RV, Black Dress - CLC, Girl Front - LOONA). 

I almost always prefer a singing chorus instead of an instrumental breakdown. 

Harmonies and ad-libs: the more the merrier. Kingdom Come and Don't U Wait No More are great at this and such songs keeps the ears active and imo provides longevity to a song.

Contrasts or unexpected turns in a song: Windy Day for example extends the chorus to include a more ""exotic"" vibe. The drop in 4minute's Hate and Big Bang's Bang x3 is a nice contrast to the rest of the song. The bridge on ""I'll Be Yours"" by Girl's Day and ""Dumb Dumb"" builds up and then suddenly extends instead of dropping.

3056,2018-10-31,2018,10,31,19,9sxia6,This subreddit is filled with a bunch of salty hypocrites.,rocz24,1540982059,"Seriously. There is always certain groups and fandoms that get uneccesary hate while others that do the same are ignored.
Go to any article thats not about EXO or BTS and read the comments. Someone will mention EXO and Stray Kids in the comments but everyone will only attack the EXO-Ls. ""Oh, why bring up another group?"" , ""This is an article about X so dont bring Y i  the conversation!!!"" But whoever mentions Stray Kids gets a pass. S
Same, or worse, with BTS. When big groups like Monsta X, Twice etc. credit BTS for ""paving the way"" there is always some elitist 2nd gen kpoppy who gets all heated and mentions other groups. Obviously they always get a pass too. We all know BTS did not pave the way, yes. They were not the first but by far the most impactful. But now groups like NCT127 are getting attention in America, but no one will credit BTS for helping not only them but Kpop in general. No, its always ""No one helped them; only their talent!!!!!!"" No BTS, no 2nd gen group. Why does BTS not get the same kind of respect? This is coming from someone who lived through the the 2nd gen too. Someone who was there through BoA's amazing career. 

Girl groups always get compared to GG and WonderGirls and 2nd gen fans think they are some high elite and everyone needs to kiss their feet. You are not smarter just because you joined kpop earlier than others. Your opinion is not more valid just because you listen to a bigger variety of music. No one is required to know the history of kpop. If you want to go down that road, discredit groups like Big Bang, Wonder Girls, people like PSY etc. as well. Because they didnt ""pave the way"" either, its was Seo Taiji &amp; Boys who started everything so get off your high horse. ",5,1
