2.	Variety Spam Control
3.	Immortal Song &amp; Sketchbook
4.	Memes, Jokes, and Humor

&amp;nbsp;

    Special Stages

We feel like the three main pillars of /r/kpop are new releases, news, and live performances.  In our efforts to keep the front page clean we may have drifted a bit too far away from live performances, so most of today's topics will attempt to walk a few steps back in that direction.  The return of the Comeback Stage was welcomed last month, so this month we'd like to add Special Stages as another exemption to the Music Show thread rule.  Special stages don't happen that often on music shows, and when they do, they are well... special.  That's why we think they deserve their own direct link.  One time where this won't apply will be at Christmas or other holidays where **every** stage is a special stage.  In those cases, we'll keep them in the music show post.  Do you agree that Special Stages should be allowed to have direct links or would you prefer they stay in the music show post?

&amp;nbsp;

    Variety Spam Control

Last month, we made an attempt to control variety spam by limiting clips to compilation posts.  However, we feel we may have gone a bit too far with that.  What we want to avoid is 4-6 clips from the same show clogging the page, but we don't want to hide all amazing variety content inside text posts.  So to address this, we'd like to allow **one clip** from a variety show to have a direct link and the rest of the clips will be directed to the comments.  We feel this will give us the best of both worlds.  The best clip from the show will get a direct link for everyone to see, and we'll avoid the multiple clip spam.  So when a new variety show is uploaded pick your favorite clip, preferably a performance clip, and post it.  Any other clips posted after the first one will be removed with instructions to post them in the comments of that first clip.  Links to full episodes, both raw and subbed, will still be allowed as well.  What do you think?  Do you want to see a direct link to one variety segment, or would you rather keep them all inside compilation posts?

&amp;nbsp;

    Immortal Song &amp; Sketchbook

These two music shows are quite a bit different than the others.  They often feature non-idol singers with perhaps one or two idol groups performing.  But when idols do go on these shows, it usually ends up being absolutely amazing!  We want to make sure no one misses these performances by having them buried inside a music show post that most fans usually don't bother checking.  For this reason, we'd like to classify these two shows as ""variety"" instead of ""music shows"" so that they will fall under the ""1 clip rule"" above.  There can still be a compilation post of the show in addition, but we want to allow that one amazing performance to stand out and get a direct link.  In the rare case that multiple idol groups perform on the show, each group can get their own single direct link post.  Are direct clips to performances on IS2 and Sketchbook something you'd like to see again on the subreddit?

&amp;nbsp;

    Memes, Jokes, and Humor

A few users have asked that we re-examine our policy on memes and other funny content.  Part of our vision for /r/kpop is to be the best english-language community for keeping up with Kpop news, new releases, and performances.  Memes, jokes, and ""shitposts"" don't really fit in with that.  In addition, a lot of these posts end up being inside jokes for members of a group's fandom and may not go over too well with the broader multi-fandom audience in /r/kpop.  That's why we've always felt that this type of content is better suited for other subreddits like /r/kpopslumberparty and /r/kpoop.   Those subreddits are dedicated to the funner side of Kpop, but they don't get a ton of traffic.  Hence, some of our users have proposed allowing memes and such in the main sub, but we'd like to get your feedback.  So tell us what you think.  Would you prefer that /r/kpop stay focused on news, releases, and performances, or would you like to see more memes and funny clips on the front page?

&amp;nbsp;

    New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",127,54,False,self,,,,,

I believe CUBE was at one point close to approaching ""Big Three"" level, but they've regressed quite a bit. BigHit is doing very well with BTS, but the company as a whole isn't at the B3 level yet. 

The artists and groups from B3 are all very talented without a doubt. However, is it their company's respective initials that automatically draw more exposure, reputation, etc? My two favorite groups are TWICE and Blackpink, and I'll use BP as an example. The members themselves are extremely talented and deserve their success. But I have to admit part of me being so hyped for BP was the fact that they're under the YG umbrella and the group was seen as the second coming of 2NE1. 

I would love to see smaller companies do well, but my overall hope is for kpop as a whole to expand even further.",57,56,False,self,,,,,

(All of these shops counts towards the Gaon / Hanteo charts)

**Yesasia**  [For US / Canda](http://www.yesasia.com/us/en/home.html) | [For the rest](http://www.yesasia.com/global/en/home.html)

Pretty sure everyone who have bought albums have at some point bought from Yesasia.

\+ Huge selection of everything. Albums / Merch / DVDs / Dramas / Indie music.

\+ Very reliable customer service.

+/- Free shipping over $40. However, often times even with free shipping it still ends up being more expensive than other shops. The only times you will get value out of this is when the albums are a lot heavier than the average album. Like BTS SLA/Young Forever + Seventeen's Love&amp;Letter. These types of albums. So just beware that just that you managed to order for $40 doesn't mean it's cheaper than from other sites where you still have to pay for shipping. $18 for an album is still more than $10 + $5 shipping.

\- It takes quite a long time for the albums to arrive when you shop from Yesasia. 

\- Packaging gets like a 2/5 rating. Not a lot of bubble wrap used.


**Catchopcd** [Link](https://www.catchopcd.net/)

""The new thing"" for the last couple of months. Every kpop collecting youtuber seem to have shifted to this shop because it's currently the best one.

\+ Cheaper than most stores.

\+ Package albums very well. 5/5 packaging. Good use of bubble wrap. [Here's an example of Tina Davidsson opening a package from Catchopcd.](https://youtu.be/Q_qfhnsW9Q0?t=258) She also agrees that Catchopcd use good amounts of bubble wrap to protect the albums. This is probably the main reason most have shifted towards their shop.

\+ The albums ships out fast and arrives faster than most sites.

\+ Pretty good customer service. Not as good as Yesasia but still good. 


\- You can't preorder. You have to wait until the day of the release for an album to place your order. That can be very nervewracking for albums that goes away fast. (Looking at you BTS and your limited prints..)

\- Bad selection of stuff. Barely any merch at all.


**Kpoptown** [Link](http://kpoptown.com/)

The first store I ordered from. I've placed a lot of orders from them over the years. 

\+ Reliable, ships out pretty fast and the albums arrive in around 2-3 weeks.

\+ Packaged well. Nice use of bubblewrap 4/5.

\+ Good customer service, haven't had any real trouble with them.

\+/- Very average price. Not good nor bad.

\+/- There is nothing that stands out. They are good and reliable. But there are shops that do it better. That's why I stopped buying from them. But there is no real negative aspect of them either.


**Kpopmart** [Link](http://kpopmart.com/)

Only ordered from them once because the order went very slow. So my experience is very biased here, take it with a bit of salt.

\+ Good selection of stuff. 

\+ Decent packaging 3.5/5

\+/- Average prices.

\- Takes ages to ship out

\- Seems slower than average to arrive to your home

\- The search engine on their website is completely broken. [Here's a video I made showing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwH-d0c1ex4)

\- There was a big scandal with them selling fake signed albums and they were expensive (like $90). Now that option is no longer available as they were called out.


**Ktown4u / DVDheaven** [Link](http://www.ktown4u.com/)

\+ Good prices. Better than average sites. 

\+ Easy selection of what type of shipping you prefer. If you only ordered 1-2 albums you can get very cheap shipping.

\+ Good packaging 4/5.

\+/- Ships out at an average rate. They used to be very fast 2 years ago. But I think Tina Davidsson promoted them a lot from a sponsorship which increased the amount of orders they got so it takes a lot longer now lol. Darn it Tina T_T

(THIS IS NOT MY OWN EXPERIENCE)

\- Bad customer service. I've heard a lot that they have bad customer service from a lot of youtubers. Luckily for me I've never had any issue with my orders and they all arrive as expected so I never had to contact customer support. Therefore I can't confirm this but I've heard enough that I thought I would mention it at least.


**Gmarket** [Link](http://global.gmarket.co.kr/Home/Main) | And [Here's a shitty video I made explaining how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YhBuObGuqs)

This is probably the best site for bulk-buyers. Here's [an example](http://imgur.com/a/cI3p4)

\+ Cheapest albums.

\+ Possible to find very rare albums for good prices. For example B.A.P's Crash used goes for $10 instead of Ebays $45

\+ Largest selection of stuff. Not only Kpop but everything Korea. Skincare + Kakao merch + Korean fashion etc

\+ ""Lucky wheel"" they have a spinning wheel you can use every day. It's fun and if you use the site often enough you can get good discounts from it. 

\+ Great daily deals. Sometimes you can find up to 95% discount on some skincare products because the exparation date is 3months forward.

\+/- The shipping is very cheap if you order a lot of albums. But very expensive if you only order a couple. The only possible shipping option is EMS. But if you order 6+ albums and compare the prices to other sites Gmarket tends to be the cheapest. Not only are they the cheapest they also ship with EMS so the order arrives within a week and there is tracking on your order. Very reliable and great site. But the more you buy the better value you get.

\- Some shops package bad. It's difficult to know which ones use good amounts of bubble wrap and which ones don't. Synnara is a good shop!

\- For the full experience you need to understand a bit of Korean. You can get away without knowing if you stick to some shops like Synnara / applemusic. For example sometimes it says  which means ""Poster"". If you think you found the album for $2 you will be disappointed.

**Mwave** [Link](http://mwave.interest.me/en/meetgreet/list)

\+ Legit signed albums. One of the very few places you can know for sure it's actually signed by the members.

\- Slow to send out.

\- Very limited stock, have to be fast.

**Ebay / Amazon**

\+ Good selection of stuff, especially out of print.

\+ Best place to buy photocards for those who collect them.

\+ Can find promo CDs which are a cool extra for collectors. Can't find them on regular sites.

+/- For regular albums they are almost always more expensive than other sites. But you can find out of print stuff here and sometimes a really good deal pops up. But for the most part it's expensive so avoid buying from here if you want an album that is easy available elsewhere.

\- It's difficult to know which sellers package well and which ones don't.",126,673,False,self,,,,,

Unfortunately, a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/578fzg/idols_doing_magic_tricks/) had its [source](http://kkuljaem.blogspot.com/2016/10/idols-doing-magic-tricks.html) blog deleted, and ~~[archive.org](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/*/http://kkuljaem.blogspot.com/2016/10/idols-doing-magic-tricks.html) does **not** have it~~ (EDIT: It has been recovered at http://kkul-jaem.blogspot.com/2017/02/1452-idols-doing-magic-tricks.html), therefore at this point there seems little choice but to make a new post with a list.

I'll start us off. Please help contribute if you know of any.

**As the magicians**:

* [Contributed](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/578fzg/idols_doing_magic_tricks/d8pxwot/) by /u/Ziiaaaac in previous post: [Choa makes marker cap disappear...?](https://fat.gfycat.com/FortunateKeyBlackfly.webm)
* [Contributed](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/578fzg/idols_doing_magic_tricks/d8pvwzb/) by /u/Lanthaneius in previous post: [Hayoung on A-Pink News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxMyMMwJ6s&amp;t=20m40s). Choi Hyun-Woo is in the audience; we'll see his name a lot more in this post.
* T-ARA Jiyeon's clothes change colours while performing Never Ever: [black to white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaAgc8LaY9A&amp;t=32), [white to red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTghDy23Oac&amp;t=36), [red to black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW3U9qNSlbU&amp;t=41). I'm not sure you can count this as magic because she can't do this live, but it's close enough I guess.
* [DIA Heehyun makes Chaeyeon's box float](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRKJx1lKEFs) in Mr. Potter (compilation).
* [CLC Yeeun turns into Seungyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elSe43GuODw&amp;t=109) while performing 1, 2, 3 - Yeeun says ""1, 2, 3, like magic!""

**Assisting a magician**:

* Various members of Fiestar in an odd series of Magic VR 360 videos with Choi Hyun-Woo. Watch in the [original Korean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUeTwyDAov4&amp;list=PLSh_TfC7ZUCnpB4FMlSNv799e9RhYJrsF) or dubbed (yes, dubbed...?!) in [Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pwin22lcfM&amp;list=PLSh_TfC7ZUCnqbea7BeEVzVoQdS5afvXZ) or [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCJ73r1Uv1k&amp;list=PLSh_TfC7ZUCm4gbQKzUj7lqj-qlxsj-Lq).
* [SNSD Yoona iodine ""coffee"" on Star King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84pOS2XaTWg) with Choi Hyun-Woo (sorry to spoil it)
* [SNSD Yuri floats and turns into a rose on Star King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MURkfdMyfM) with Choi Hyun-Woo
* [Girl's Day Minah teleportation on Magic Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDoqq9UPryU) with Choi Hyung-Bae
* [Girl's Day Minah compression on Magic Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5au7jh81lA) with Nicky Yang
* [Girl's Day Hyeri cut apart on Magic Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwDB_Vpf8c) with Choi Hyun-Woo - the last part kind of reminds you of [Lift Off of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PoDhuIp3I0) (non-kpop) - sorry if that spoils it.
* [T-ARA Eunjung and Hyomin appear and disappear on Star King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQbtcKbeZkY) with Choi Hyun-Woo (nice [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJwYjqKm0B8) too)

Eclipse: To represent the Lunar Eclipse that happens. This album will be a ""turning point""/ ""break away"" from the image that EXID's ""signature"" image that was created from their Up &amp; Down to L.I.E era. The group will be making a comeback as 4 without Solji but their album name ECLIPSE has two meanings. Overtime an Eclipse goes through phases but soon will always become full again and shine the brightest when it is full (full moon), this is the same with EXID. In addition, because there are phases in an eclipse, this mini album will also showcase the changes each member has made musically.

Tracks: 

1. Boy: Interlude to title track, Night Rather Than Day. Hip Hop Trap genre with synthesizer. Lots of focus on the vocals and emotions. Lyrics are about being left alone at night.

2. Night Rather Than Day: Upbeat R&amp;B. Lyrics are emotion, and play along with the rhythm. Each member has distinguishable parts. Song will incorporate modern and vintage influences. 

3. How Why: EDM genre. About a breakup where the heart is not one with the body where questions continue on with How? and Why? in regards to a breakup. Super EDM. There's also a really good ""drop"".

4. Milk (Hani's Solo): Sequel from Hani's Hello from STREET. Urban R&amp;B with a nice bass. 

Nothing about track 5, Velvet.

Video: https://twitter.com/tkffuTek/status/849153471534080001

As seen in the video, Yuju notices it and tells Sowon, who relays it to the manager. She tells SinB as well but she didn't notice, leading her to take a second look. Yerin noticed it as well, and proceeded to say it was nice before taking it and investigating. She then tells the manager, who later confiscates it. (At this point her smile fades immediately, you can tell she's uncomfortable)

"""" (hidden camera glasses) later trended worldwide, The Huffington Post Korea had an [article](http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/2017/04/04/story_n_15798216.html) as well

Apparently this isn't the first time, as back during Navillera an older manager confiscated a similar device. It's also rumored that this man has been doing this at other groups' fansigns as well.

Considering it's already allowed to record videos and take photos in fansigns, this really isn't necessary and a huge invasion of privacy.

I'll try to correct it. And I hope something like this hasn't been discussed recently, but I couldn't see it when I searched. Simple TLDR at bottom.



I've only been in the kpop game for a year and some months. I often feel uneducated and wish I had lived through the ""Golden"" age of kpop and any other cherished eras. Like ... damn, I would have loved to see Shinee debut. 




Anyway, if you were to make a timeline, **a timeline that marks the most important and/or personal favorite kpop event of every year**- that is, one event per year - what would yours look like? Example below because thats a shit description lul





I can't give a truthful example because I've only been around so long, but just for descriptive purposes: 


**2005** - Super Junior debut


**2006** - Big Bang debuts


**2007** - Girls' Generation debuts


**2008** - SHINee debut &amp; Wonder Girls' ""Nobody"" releases &amp; Big Bang releases ""Lies""


**2009** - 3 way tie --&gt; SNSD's ""Gee"" drops, SHINee's classic ""Ring Ding Dong"" as well, and maybe the most covered song I've seen on stages, ""Sorry, Sorry"" by Suju comes out



**2010** - IU's ""Good Day"" releases, sweeping her to stardom (**elaborate if you want!**)





and so on...




You can skip years if you want. You can do... whatever you want. You can have multiple for one year, but try to keep it to less than five maybe? I'd love to hear descriptions from veteran kpop listeners, to hear what it was like watching it all go down in real time. PS - I don't necessarily believe in the timeline I wrote above. Just off the top of my Google head. Can't say it's too unique, but IU is my wife so I definitely had to include her.




**TLDR** Make a chronological timeline by year, marking the most important/personal favorite kpop events of each year in your oh so humble opinion - and do elaborate if you want!

We are running a fundraiser for [Justice For The Comfort Women](https://www.facebook.com/womenandwar) to spread awareness of sexual slavery in Asia in WWII and to support its survivors. This is a cause EXO cares about. All donors are entered to win an autographed EXO CD!

The second part of our project is, we are hosting EXO-L meetups all over Canada this weekend, in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. We always have a good time at our meetups! We will be collecting donations at the meetups and raffling off more autographed EXO CDs.

More information about the cause, and all of the other details of the project are on our [website](http://www.exocanada.net/exo5yearproject). Thank you to the mods for allowing me to share this, and thanks to you for reading!",19,81,False,self,,,,,

It was sad to see it go, but it made me curious: where/how do you guys discover new groups/artists? Specifically, I mean like newly debuting groups/rookies, but underrated groups that don't get a lot of press are fine too! 

Here's a few of mine:

* [Kpop 101: Who's Who](http://kishimotoerika.livejournal.com/) - the one that closed, but they did make a post for 2017 so still useful

* [K-Pop Debuts](http://kpop-debuts.tumblr.com/) - slow to update, so might be closing down soon :(

* [KpopInfo114](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/) - one of the best places to find basic profiles for new and existing groups, also does bi-weekly release posts 

* [wasa.B](http://wasabcon.tistory.com/), [CP-STUDIO](http://cp-studio.net/), and [C-STUDIO](http://c-studio.tistory.com/) - a couple magazine and photo/video blogs I found that are great for discovering the groups that aren't ""big enough"" to get on music shows regularly or are a bit ""outside"" of the mainstream KPop scene (such as Baba, Pocket Girls, Various, ChicAngel, all the dance teams, etc.)

* [  - Mirrorball Music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUnhZuoNcL89qNax7YlWvavQ) [KIndie] and [DanalEntertainment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmctTnUfbeoycGhieZQAmw) - a couple of lesser known music distribution channels (similar to 1thek, cjenmusic,  (bugs), and kt music) 

I know there are a few more I bookmarked to look into, but these are the ones I actively follow in my feeds :)",49,46,False,self,,,,,

I really like vocals, so it's something that gets my attention when I find new songs or groups.  
For me, [B1A4's Jinyoung](https://youtu.be/CoObTyYr814?t=39) is a great example of that. I know his voice might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I have a tendency to enjoy more nasally sounding voices. ^^^Jessica, ^^^I ^^^miss ^^^you    

Also, I can spot [SNSD's Hyoyeon's](https://youtu.be/ZO_1yKHIDdo?t=61) voice from a mile away and she's been improving so much for the past few years. Plus that performance is one of my favorites ever, everyone looking good and singing so well!    

[SHINee's Onew](https://youtu.be/IE1YfyhoVOo?t=90) has one of the most interesting voices I have EVER heard and, to me, he stands out in a group that has excellent vocalists. I just feel very comfortable when his parts come up during songs.",151,87,False,self,,,,,

I don't see this as a sign of appreciation at all. Appreciating my culture would mean speaking up about issues that threaten the beliefs of my people. Appreciating my culture would mean learning about contemporary artists like Frank Waln, A Tribe Called Red, and others. Appreciation would be speaking up when my people go through what they did during the #NoDAPL protests in the winter. 

All of those feathers and headdresses mean something, and it /really/ hurts when I see some of my favorite idols like Park Jimin and Kim Heechul disrespect the history behind those items. 

This may have already been addressed in an earlier convo, but I really got into KPOP a little under a month ago. 

I am conflicted. 

Edit: I love Park Jimin and Kim Heechul and KPOP still, I just wish I could talk to them, person to person. ",39,1,False,self,,,,,

This was strictly top 5. I believe there's a top 10 around for only 2015 and 2016. And then there's also top songs separated by age groups in those same years. Names you haven't heard of are likely to be trot and/or ballad singers (ballads are still huge in Korea).

If there are any mistakes, feel free to correct and I'll edit it! And I've added links! If you haven't listened to the songs, it's totally worth it to do throwbacks to past hits, or to even see if you like ballads.

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

I have to admit I contribute to this culture when I'm afraid to criticize groups that I like to avoid being alienated by other fans and sometimes I get overly defensive to legitamete critical comments. What do you feel are the best ways to be critical to groups and songs that you like (or don't like) and still not come across or be tossed aside as a hater? How do you feel about this culture in general and what it leads to?,56,39,False,self,,,,,

I was reading earlier about how Leeteuk from Super Junior's father strangled his grandparents and then killed himself while Leeteuk was in his military enlistment.

I didn't know about it since I only recently got into k-pop. Are there any other situations like this that newer fans might not know about?

I am studying abroad there this semester and keep getting lucky with these k-pop related things. I had no idea how to format this so it isn't a wall of text, my bad. I will start with Inkigayo:

---

My professor took us to Inkigayo to watch some of the pre-recordings. The time we got to watch lasted about 30-40 minutes and we got to see the recording of various groups, as well as the MC interview/transition segments. My first observation is that the inside where they record is a lot smaller than you would think based on performance videos online. There actually isn't that much room for many people in the audience due to the many cameras and rigs set up, and my group was in seats behind all the cameras. The small MC stage is actually off to the right of the main performance stage and is also very small.

We got to see a few groups perform. We got to see Oh My Girl (Incredible, huge fan), and Pristin and Lovelyz (Also great). Oh My Girl performed Perfect Day, and the chair-based choreography was sexy and cute. I honestly don't love Pristin's debut, but I like them a lot more after seeing them in person. I didn't know the boy groups who performed during our time, but the group Romeo was pretty cool. We had to leave right before Winner was to perform, so that was sad. I also didn't get to see Girls Day, but this was also free so I'm not complaining at all. The MC's were really entertaining, Jisoo (Blackpink) is super cute in person and she waved at me as I was leaving.

---

I was super lucky to get into the fansign for Oh My Girl. I only bought a single album, but I ended up getting chosen. I was nervous because I don't speak Korean very well, but I ended up sitting next to a Japanese girl who helped translate important things (I can speak Japanese pretty well). They were wearing purple dresses that were super cute, and they all looked just as beautiful up close as they do on screen. Even though I don't speak much Korean at well, I managed to say a good amount and communicate with each of them, so it was super successful in my eyes.

My first member to meet was [Mimi](http://imgur.com/dPHPGSv), who is also my favorite member. In Korean, I managed to tell her that she is my favorite Korean rapper and she seemed very touched. Then I told her I was also a rapper, so she told me to rap for her! I rapped two lines and then got shy and stopped but she said it was perfect. Her smile is infinitely more beautiful in person. I actually prepared a small present I had in my pocket, but completely forgot to give it to her because I was looking at her face.

[Binnie](http://imgur.com/8uyYKbe) actually spoke the most English to me, which I wasn't expecting. Her English was really well pronounced, and of course she was adorable saying it. I told her that I was an exchange student, and when she asked how old I was, she called me Oppa and it actually killed me. Actually, every member called me oppa or told me to call them noona, which I know is a cultural mainstay but it still felt very meaningful for me. Binnie also has really pretty eyes, which is something I never noticed on the screen.

[Jiho](http://imgur.com/IsQ2QlB) is so damn pretty, like omg. She and I spoke the least, but wow she's seriously pretty. [Yooa](http://imgur.com/q7jKmrd) is also very pretty, and she seemed genuinely interested in the fact that I came all the way from America.

[Arin](http://imgur.com/TDPRKIh) and I were both failing to speak each other's language and kept apologizing for it, it was super cute. She's really adorable, but she's also very mature. She's the only one who wrote my name in Korean, and even wrote oppa~

[Seunghee](http://imgur.com/7qLNJPU)'s English was incredible, as I expected already, and she sounded so excited and interested when we talked about me studying, and how I saw them at Inkigayo that morning, it was really nice.

[Hyojung](http://imgur.com/o2tybRD) was super energetic the entire fansign, both with the person she is signing the album of, and with the rest of the audience. She talked to them, posed for pictures, etc. more than the other members.

At the end, the group did impressions of Pokemon and did anime poses, said some words and then we left. The crowd was incredibly tame and respectful, which I really appreciate. Even the big guys with deep voices were calm and didn't do weird things, like I kind of expect from girl group fan events. There was a good number of girls in the audience, and some Japanese and Chinese people as well.

---

Overall it was an incredible, yet tiring day. I hope to o to more events in the future, EXID comes back soon so I will enter for any fansigns they do as well.",28,95,False,self,,,,,

I made a gigantic Spotify playlist of translated Korean music (some I attempted to translate) with the synced lyrics in English on the mobile app for Musixmatch. So far, it really is helping the vocabulary and grammar patterns to stick. The link is here:

https://open.spotify.com/user/1224401565/playlist/1DlJ8oxZFEjmT3P3Hrli5h?context=spotify%3Auser%3A1224401565%3Aplaylist%3A1DlJ8oxZFEjmT3P3Hrli5h

Does anyone else do this? Made any progress?

Edit: I meant to say using music as an aid and not as the sole source of studying. I should probably add that I've studied Korean on and off since 2003. I've taken it at an intermediate level in a formal class, self studied a lot, and visited S. Korea where I could converse about common things that didn't involve complexity. ",18,42,False,self,,,,,

Recently hit me how amazing Red Velvet's 'Little Little' is, just beautifully produced and arranged. Not to mention the choreography for the dance was so freaking good it was almost like an unlocked bonus RV level.  


My other favorite definitely has to go to Gfriend's  Hear The Wind Sing"" (wish it was the title track) which may actually be my favorite track from them. They were littlerally glowing while performing it too. 


Special recognition also goes to CLC's ""Eighteen"" although it's not new and wasn't a bside it is one if my favorites by them, I believe it was just a quick digital single era

Ello, ello. 


The last few days have been surreal. Its hard to think that I actually had the chance to meet the idols themselves, as well as talking to and holding hands with them! For the sake of keeping it short ill be limiting this post but I will have a google doc which lists everything out in detail if youre keen on reading more. (Its far more lengthier than what you will be reading here! Itll be.. A journey?)


There will be some pictures and gifs along the way. Whilst you're here why don't you watch the entirety (bar 40 minutes) of the First Coloring Book Fansign? [Credits to Gustav!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q2eqSCDGgM) (at 42 minutes to 51 minutes i'm the female with the orange ombre hair.)


Small/medium/big plug for /r/wmohmygirl and the [oh my girl discord!](http://discord.me/OhMyGirl)

&amp;nbsp;

_____

&amp;nbsp;

So! For both fan signs I bought 8 albums each for a total of 16. I didn't know how many I needed so I went with 8 each because there's 8 members. I'm wanting to sell them to get back money but i'm unsure of how to do so (small cry for help)

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;**Format**
&gt;Getting in - gifts/images - one-on-one / signed page - group talk/fan interactions 

&amp;nbsp;


**Fan sign number one! [08/04/2017]**

&amp;nbsp;

**Getting in**


The building for this fan sign was at a youth centre three stops away from where i'm staying. Hard to find because there really wasn't any notable signage of where they'd be, but I managed to find them. Along the way to getting [my seat number (32)](http://imgur.com/59iyIBs) I made a Korean friend who appears throughout the rest of this fan account.


[As I sit down i'm basically the third last seat to the right of the auditorium](http://imgur.com/ckETg73), so my bias Mimi is on the exact opposite end.

&amp;nbsp;

**Gifts and order of seating** - [Mimi](http://imgur.com/DiHQ6TP), [Binnie](http://imgur.com/Zm0B91S), [Arin](http://imgur.com/Msv1yUq), [Jiho](http://imgur.com/nWX9p4P), [Yooa](http://imgur.com/GCxvW5G), [Seunghee](http://imgur.com/hcxHsb0), [Hyojung](http://imgur.com/Jw0lpYE)

I didn't know what to get them as it was a day left and I didn't think buying them something would be effective. In the end I drew my favourite pictures quickly as well as write out a letter in very bad korean. I've edited that out to hide the shame by the way.

&amp;nbsp;

**One-on-one**

Truth be told as I was very nervous and anxious (my chest was tight...) I don't exactly remember much of the conversations I had with the girls in this fansign. The next one i'm far more calm and collected! I just wanted to get my presents across and introduce myself today.


I tried to represent the international fans as much as possible, as per request of some of the members on the OMG discord and my friends in real life. I told (I believe) Binnie, Jiho and Hyojung that there are a lot of foreign fans that love Oh My Girl.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Mimi](http://imgur.com/5MARIO1)** - First member off and im sweating - nervous as hell. Its rap god Mimi and im trash for Mimi. I told Mimi she was my favourite, we gave each other high fives. Words that need to be spoken - her voice is no joke. Its.. husky? Cool? Very nice.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Binnie](http://imgur.com/z0MUfvX)** - The short haired goddess. She asked how long I was in Korea for and I said 6 weeks, she then asked how long it has been since. I misheard so I said I had been in Korea for 4 weeks already, which is a lie, i'm here for another 3 weeks. Before I moved onto  Arin Binnie held my hands and said to me in English, I hope.. You.. long.. she was struggling so I think she was saying something along the lines of - having a good time in korea or be a fan for a long time. Regardless! The effort that they put in is astounding. Her english is very cute. She's very cute.


I accidentally knocked over the small poster she had at the front of her table. You can see that in the gifs linked down below. (I think I did it on the second day too.)

&amp;nbsp;

**[Arin](http://imgur.com/Zu2zhHz)** - She wrote to Caitlin Unnie. Arin is very cute herself - I honestly can't remember what I said to her. There was a lot of hand shaking and high fives. This day was more about physical contact instead of actually saying anything coherent out of my dumb mouth.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Jiho](http://imgur.com/OoB1Hgs)** - The handsomest. I didn't have any words for her really. As in, which i'll be stating in the second fan sign, she was too much for me to even think at the time. Regardless she did a LOT of fan interactions for those who were sitting down whilst she was waiting for another album to sign.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Yooa](http://imgur.com/wdDCvxF)** - Yooa is GREAT this comeback. Well, she's always perfect and great and many other positive adjectives, but seeing her face to face was astounding. The lenses, her hair, she looked so mature and pretty. She asked me where I was from, she looked at my drawing and was surprised and as I moved on to Seunghee (you get so focused on the member in front you don't notice what the other one is doing!) she read my letter.


One of the girls said that they liked my dyed hair and I think it was Yooa who said it.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Seunghee](http://imgur.com/FdCxWDJ)** - Oh jesus. Seunghee is SO bright and energetic. Her expressions are cute and you can basically read everything with the way she moves her brows. When she was signing my album she made a small mistake and started exclaiming, 'oh no! oh no!' so she drew a bunch of hearts underneath to cover it up. The mistake was she wrote an uppercase I instead of a T. I remember that I told her that I watched their first MCountdown performance well, as well as informing her that her performance of 'Goose dream' by Insooni was my favourite of all from her. She asked me which song was my favourite.


Seunghee's English i'll mention about in the second fansign. She spoke to me in English and it was.. just mind blowing.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Hyojung](http://imgur.com/9xme4n0)** - The candy leader! She's so sweet. When she asked me which song i liked I said I liked all of them, but in the end I meekly confessed that I liked 'Closer', which she then sang to me! After that I said, 'A-and   ?' to which she did some aegyo, finishing off with 'AING!'. 


I was so startled by it (in a good way), that I could only thank them as I went down off the stage and back to my seat, wondering if all of this was really real.


I told all the girls that I wanted to go to the next fan sign the day after, which I managed to do so. They also said my Korean was good. Haha-

&amp;nbsp;

**Group talk/fan interactions**

Whenever theres a gap in the line and no member is signing, usually the last 5 - Arin, Jiho, Yooa, Seunghee and Hyojung, they either talk and/or interact with the fans. Binnie and Mimi at the front are swamped with all the fans so they really only talk at the end.


Going to have to bullet point this -


* When Coloring book is playing Seunghee keeps on raising her water bottle as a joke - during the lyrics  ~ [[1]](http://imgur.com/NCYGyVi),
 [[2]](http://imgur.com/mLyXnyy)
* I shot Hyojung with finger guns and hearts, which she replied to.
* Got Hyojung to play rock paper scissors with me. I won - paper to rock.
* Someone gave Yooa a minecraft diamond sword, it flashes. [[1]](http://imgur.com/rVRFtVt)
* Yooa proceeds to wave the sword at the fans, as well as stabs Seunghee with it and pulls it out. Seunghee is acting 101 as she proceeds to fake die.
* Jiho advertises everyone's qr codes, especially Hyojung and Yooa's because they're so cute/cool/beautiful(?)
* Jiho and Yooa individually try to sing some of the song that is playing, both forget what comes next or only know a certain part. (Cute!)
* Hyojung receives an eevee plushy and proceeds to baby it. [[1]](http://imgur.com/cRWrI7Q)
* Jiho receives a huge photo of herself which seems to be printed on metal? [[1]](http://imgur.com/RYsg3fK)
* I manage to sit in the middle, swapping seats with my new korean friend for ten minutes. I get Jiho's attention with finger guns, she thinks i'm trying to hadouken her but in reality I want to do some rock paper scissors. We still hadouken but I lose at rock paper scissors.
* I grabbed Hyojungs attention and made her do the owl face / spiderman face, she couldnt do it the first few times so I had to guide her whilst i was sitting, when she did it she yelled out in english, youre a master! and then turned to seunghee and made her do it. Seunghee got it in one go.

Waah! First fan sign done!

&amp;nbsp;

_____

&amp;nbsp;

Hope you haven't lost interest yet -- there's still fan sign number two to read.

&amp;nbsp;

**Fan sign number two! [09/04/2017]**

&amp;nbsp;

**Getting in**

&amp;nbsp;

Way easier this time! It said which floor and there was some posters directing us as to where to go. Funny story happens before I get into the auditorium which leads me to buy a tooth brush travel pack and brush my teeth in the toilets. I was number 97 to be pulled by lottery, but the seating is still random so when I got in I got [number 21!](http://imgur.com/3KnXhLZ) And Mimi is the [one closest to me!](http://imgur.com/pfeNCU4) [[1]](http://imgur.com/3RGds2n), [[2]](http://imgur.com/pHFOCMl)

&amp;nbsp;

**Gifts and order of seating** - It's the same today! Well, not the gifts, I didn't have enough time to draw anything. Instead I grabbed some of my pokemon cards which I got from the pokemon centre in tokyo! I also attached to them a card cover which has pikachu disguised as vulpix and the alola vulpix. Reverse holos! [[1]](http://imgur.com/ZuhXutB), [[2]](http://imgur.com/Yu2rivO).

&amp;nbsp;

**One-on-one**


This time around I only get to high five/hold hands with Hyojung, but that's okay! I was focusing on talking and making them pick the card out at random.


I'm way more calm and collected - except that this time around the fan sign was more organised and it was only a few minutes before I was up for my turn.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Mimi](http://imgur.com/DcxV0i9)** - I said to her long time no see, which she replied to - liar! (im not a liar, ahem.) and then I said in Korean I didnt know love until I met you, and she exclaimed liar again. I got the sentence off my new korean friend from the first coloring book fansign. I told her I liked her voice, then I made her choose a card. I told Mimi I liked her voice and that it was very cool. Probably weird, but her voice is wah-


The card Mimi chose is Litten.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Binnie](http://imgur.com/lPFW2am)** - I also said long time no see. I asked her what her hobby was and she replied in english! Very cute, she took her time to make sure she said the right things. Tapping her chin in thought, etc. She said, I like listening.. Music.. And sleeping! she acted out the sleeping part, putting both her hands to one side of her face and leaning on it. Then I asked in rather poor korean (The pronunciation for some words are so different to english!) what genre and she said ballad. When she was signing she wrote on the opposite page she did yesterday! I was like, ah, no, no! Because I had placed post it notes all over the album so they knew which one to go to. It was my mistake because some fans usually have the page they want open by the time they get to the member. She just signed the other page because I said it was okay.


Binnie received Eevee! she was so excited she held her hands up in the air and.. squealed? Something cute, i'm sure.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Arin](http://imgur.com/HAX9A9s)** - Arin! I asked her why she was so pretty. When she got to her full spread page in the album I told her to write all over it. Hands flying everywhere, just saying, ! !  ! so she signed the whole entire page. When she chose out Nebby I was already moving towards Jiho, but I tried to tell her that she looked like Nebby and that Nebby was very cute! I wanted Arin to get Nebby because it reminds me of all the 'get back in the bag nebby' memes. Arin seemed like the type. No Arin no-

&amp;nbsp;

**[Jiho](http://imgur.com/dbIdAY4)** - I told her that my heart hurt in korean. Pointing towards my chest she was like, Sick!? in english. In the end I said it was because she was so beautiful and I was anxious. Because Jiho is right in front of me, I have no words, shes too beautiful. Jiho also tried to pronounce my name Caitlin, she had it right yesterday but today it was a bit off, so I helped her and then stated that today I was Cate. During the I have no words part, Jiho said but your korean is good! so she misunderstood me there.


Jiho picked out Poliwag! (I didn't know till I was on the train that Yooa has been compared to Poliwag before, I wanted to give them a card each based on what I thought of them but I thought it was rude, hence the random picking.)


Being right next to Yooa, she pointed at the card and then said to me, look! Its yooa!. Before I knew it I said in english, ah! Thats why I made you pick at random! Thats mean! they didnt understand what I meant when I said thats mean, but then I said   and they seemed to get it.


&amp;nbsp;

**[Yooa](http://imgur.com/hpGPamR)** - She seemed to be tired today. She asked me if it was my first time, which I replied to no, that I was here yesterday. The goddess herself asked where I was from and when I replied she was like, Ah! Caitlin! (she checked the other page she signed), I remember! I remember all! Memory good! in English. her arms were spread out to emphasise how great her memory was. It was really cute, I wasnt offended at all. I told Yooa that I wanted to go to more fansigns so I can have all of their signatures on every single page (im greedy). She thought it was funny.


Yooa received Rowlett, which is the pokemon I thought Binnie would suit.

&amp;nbsp;

**[Seunghee](http://imgur.com/mJ2nJ2C)** -  Her english! Well, I already stated that part in the first fansign, but she is super adorable and energetic! When she saw me her whole entire face (and eyebrows) lit up! You can hear her voice a lot in the fansign video. Anyways after saying hello she asked which photos I liked in the album. After stating all, like the trash I am, I wanted to say theres none that I hate, but I said it incorrectly in Korean! She stated Why! Why! in English, so I had to restate that I liked it all and that there were none that I hate (properly this time). As I was going to Hyojung I said to Seunghee that her English is good! Her English accent is really cute. Cue eyebrows raised cutely once more and an exclaimed, really!?. She was excited to see the pokemon card that she chose. When I explained to Seunghee how I was Cate today and that it was a nickname, I feel like it must have confused them. 


Seunghee received Popplio!

&amp;nbsp;

**[Hyojung](http://imgur.com/hKknBCC)** - She was the only one at this fan sign that I actually held/touched hands with. She remembered me! I cant exactly remember the first part of the conversation because I whipped out the last card which was for her. When she saw the card (Brionne) she asked what it was, to which I replied in a very bad mix of English and Korean.  type! Second evolution! points towards the corner,  evolution!   ! ! Power up! We both acted out powering up, as in just flexing/raising our arms. She said thank you and I explained to her I got it in Japan. As I was leaving she said it was cute but I turned around and said, Ah, hyojungssi too is very cute!


Then she did a cute pose and I went back to my seat.


The rest of the time I was live blogging to the guys on discord, with very broken English because I dont have auto correct nor will I ever get it on my phone.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group talk/fan interactions**


* Earlier Seunghee was talking with the fans, she was like everyone say ani-- I couldnt hear the rest but the fans replied back enthusiastically.
* During the fan sign someone fell off the stool - the stool slipped out under them but Arin, Jiho and Yooa stood up to help him. 
* Fans are trying to grab Jihos attention. One fan tried to make Binnie sing Cupid.
* Seunghee was just playing with her Apeach headband. When I looked at her she raised her arms up to the sky, a very cute gesture. Hyojung has a huge chuppa chup toy. Binnie has a huge coca cola plushy. 
* A male fan had a huge camera with the lens being cameo textured. When he was up to Jiho, Jiho took it off of him and pointed it at the fans, pretending to shoot at them once more.
* The girls like to dance to the songs sometimes just simple gestures or using their hands. Hyojung did an aegyo combo which killed everyone.
* There was a female fan with a selfie stick stuck in between her legs, just recording what was going on, so I decided to do it too and I managed to get about the last thirty minutes. [[1]](http://imgur.com/7JnEgRu)

&amp;nbsp;

**Notes**

&amp;nbsp;

* Seunghees reactions are no joke! Her voice is quite loud and you can hear her exclaim out loud in english, especially if the fan shes with is a foreigner. Today we had 3 to 4 other foreigners (as in white skin. There are a lot of Japanese people. The manga artist Yasuhiro Nightow was at the first fansign. Thanks discord for the info.)
* Even though I was on the far left this fan sign and I was able to see Mimi, it is far better to sit in the middle or a bit to the right! Mimi and Binnie were always signing and barely had any time to take a break, whilst the other 5 had gaps in between them at random stages. A fan which moved a lot between the row in front and behind of me would always take photos during the transition between the next fan going up and the fan going to Binnie.
* Not so much a note but because my hands were clammy during the first fansign I brought hand wipes, used it before I went up and then left it in my bag. When I put my album back in my bag it got a little bit wet... I'm not that smart. [[1]](http://imgur.com/zL06bjU), [[2]](http://imgur.com/dDH44xn).

&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully I didn't miss out on anything that I wrote down! I took screenshots of everything I wrote on discord, wrote it out in two different google docs and now i'm compiling it together.

Hi, the Air Force guy from post from a while ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5xr0xx/korean_airforce_guy_and_his_experience_with_kpop/?st=j1bxazqd&amp;sh=12395cf2


**For general questions and more please check out last thread, a lot of them are answered over there.**


[Some of you asked for proof, so I took a pic of my Air Force Uniform](http://imgur.com/gallery/gSpm6)

***

I was searching through intranet (army only net) and found rankings made by other air force soldiers. They were quite different from mine, which relied mostly on my personal bias and some other soldiers I live/work with.


Of course, they are too made by individuals which mean they can and probably has similar problems, but they are made from bigger samples, from various places.


Thought you guys might be interested in it, and put some of them into another rank list!




***
Fandom Size+Public Popularity+Selling Power taken into account
***



**S+ rank**



**Twice**


-The unmatched girl group of present days. 


**S rank**


**Red Velvet**


-Had been out and in of S rank depending on the last song.


-But their company, SM is rich and pushing them hard with power of money well.


***
**A+ rank**



**Gfriend**


- Is considered 'rival' of Twice mostly due to contrasting images. (Western, modern feeling vs Korean, 80/90s feeling)


- They could have been in S rank, but last song (Fingertip) was not that successful.


**Blackpink**


- Company and selling power is S rank but fandom is too weak yet.



**AOA**


-Sells well and is widely known, but having troubles and rumors recently which is not helping much.


**Mamamooo**


- Not really strong fandom, but is liked widely with only few haters. So even those usually uninterested in girlgroups like them.



**A rank**




**Apink**


- Good songs+Known Well+ Strong Fandom, this put them in S rank but had been not doing well recently.


**Girl's Day**


- Had being out of game too long, but is still widely known and selling well with recent return.




**Sistar**


- Sells and known as much as S rank but fandom is weak.


- Doing very well for relatively older group.


**EXID**


- Really popular among soldiers thanks to sexy concept, but this also makes them target of some haters.


- Sells well and is known well. But fandom size is smallest in A rank. 


**A- rank**


**Lovelyz**


- Nicknamed 'The Gatekeeper' for not being strong enough to be solidly on A rank but is stronger compared to B ranks.


- Not sells quite well, but their fandom, which has lots of 30+ and older fans with strong loyalty, which not many own.


***


**B+ rank**





**Oh My Girl**


- On the contrary, they are popular within soldiers but is not really widely known yet. But has potential to be A or even S rank.


**Cosmic Girls**


- Cheng Xiao and Yeung Jung addition+ Secret and I Wish being hit helped hem well. But not strong enough.



**Pristin**


- Really young group, but is having solid start.



**B rank**



**Laboum**


- Solbin carried the team hard and is selling well. Quite popular within soldiers because they often come do military-related events. 
Their naming of group sucks though.


**Gugudan**


- On this rank only thanks to Sejoung and Mina's popularity. Sejoung should go solo if she wants to survive.


**April**


- April Story was good but was not really successful. Hopefully they can do better, hopeful after adding Chegyung.





**CLC**


- They are unpopular within soldiers but they are more of girlcrush, and sell quite well outside, thanks to female fans.




***


**C rank**


**Sonamoo**


- The group with worst name ever. Feels too 90s. They seem talented and pretty, but don't sell well.


**Dia**


- Barely surviving only thanks to Chae-yeon.

***
Other stuff
***

- IU and her last song, Through the Night is being loved by pretty much everyone. Have seen some officers/generals listening that.


- People are not sure what to make out of Mina and Bambam 'scandal'. Are they angry about it or confused or don't care?


- Produce 101 2nd Season, AKA Broduce 101, is almost totally ignored here. Few reaction I overheard are 'Ew' 'Why' 'Wonder how many of them are bullies?' 'JangMoonBok (AKA Rap God) for Top of Top alrighty?'


- Highlight's songs are liked here. Something of a rare feat for a boygroup! (We even watched Weekly Idol episode of them, mostly for comedic failure of 2x dance, but we did)


- Idom@ster B-side is considered ridiculous attempt by many. Some like their songs/performances though.


- One of officers I am close with mentioned Nayoung (pre-IOI, now Pristin member) was popular in his town as something of 'Sleeping Beauty' - the attractive, popular girl who slept through every class except for PE and lunch break.


- Not really related to Kpop, but someone joked about two rappers in High School Rap (Hiphop competition for high schoolers from Mnet) were gay when they started showing some bromance, and others watching took it...quite maturely well. 'I am glad homos are can stand up now' 'Brave of them to show up.' 'Kind of others for not judging' etc    I honestly expected something a lot worse.",199,304,False,self,,,,,

My name is Stephen and I host the podcast ""This Week in Kpop"". It's been around two years since I last posted about our show here. Recently we hit a couple of cool milestones, but first some thoughts. I'll put the self-promotion at the end.

4 years ago when I started the podcast I thought there was a severe lack of diversity when it came to Kpop related content. 98% of Kpop related content were covers, reactions, lists, and re-edits of other things. Sadly, this hasn't really changed. Kpop related blogs don't really promote content that isn't there own, unless it's already a viral hit. Even on this subreddit, most original content is downvoted.  

In the last two years, a lot of new podcasts have appeared. For most of that time, I thought of these other podcasts as competition and wanted to crush them. I would check to see if other podcasts were still alive when I do my obsessive iTunes checking each day. Recently I've started thinking about it differently. 

Right now Kpop discussion podcasts are a niche of a niche of a niche. The only way to grow our podcast significantly is to grow all Kpop podcasts. I truly think that there is a bigger audience for discussion podcasts out there. They just don't know it's an option. 

Of course, I want you to listen to our own podcast. If you haven't tried it, I really hope you do. I think it's the best. But maybe you don't like what we do. Luckily there are a lot of other options now. Kpop Hot Pot, Kpopcast, The Kpop Show, K-pop Unmuted, Daebakcast, Jinjja Cha Podcast, Not Your Average Netizens, Black Seoul Podcast, The Melanetizen Podcast, and so many more that I'm not thinking of right now. You might find one that you like. 

I didn't mean for this to be a rant, and I hope it doesn't read like one. I'm geniungly curious what this community thinks about original content, discussion podcasts, or my own podcast.

Promotion time.

Two years ago we were at 100,000 downloads and last month we managed to soar past 500,000. We also recently started a new monthly podcast called ""The Kpop Round Table"", where a guest joins us to talk about the top 3 &amp; most disappointing song of the previous month. In our [first episode](https://soundcloud.com/thisweekinkpop/kpoproundtable1), we got Jonathan from Kpop Hot Pot to provide his perspective on things. My goal is to get as many different perspectives as I can for future KRT episodes. (If anyone knows JRE, I'd KILL to get his perspective on Kpop)

You can find our show on any podcasting platform (like [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-week-in-kpop/id594315562?mt=2&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4) or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/thisweekinkpop))

If any current or aspiring podcast hosts want to ask any questions, I'd be happy to answer to the best of my ability. ",12,15,False,self,,,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/643x1l/thoughts_on_feminism_in_kpop_cute_girl_groups_vs/

At first, I didnt know what video was being referenced by so many users in that post, but assumed it was just some dumb newbie reaction video where western people always find the ""stronger"" girl group more appealing than the ""cute"" ones and thought whatever.

But then just now I stumbled upon this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91yCTGK-_RY from the rising popular kpop channel ""Classical Musician's react to kpop"". And feel like the debate in the post linked above and what was said in this video (the one that I'm pretty sure was being referenced) to be completely different points, and idky a lot of people gave the video flack.

I thought it was the general opinion that the lyrics to Cheer Up were garbage to both men and women? I definitely remember it being talked about when the song first released. Several times the lyrics reference what it means to be a girl and a man (""A girl cant give her heart too easily"", ""Be a man, a real man""). No one is calling TWICE anti feminist here, but those lyrics to Cheer Up? come on

Idk after watching the actual reaction, even though I didnt agree with everything that was said ([although the main girl who brought up this discussion clarifies her points more here since so many people misunderstood - hence the last post](https://twitter.com/_emcha_/status/850900511645732865)), I feel like people were kind of arguing against a strawman. And really focused on the BP comment even though it was said very offhandedly at the end of the vid, and the person saying it clearly hadnt read their lyrics and were only going off the MV impressions (read the clarification link to understand more). Idk about you guys, but I was very shocked to read Whistle's lyrics for the first time as it was completely different to how the MV portrayed them.

Anyway, I just wanted to provide context since the last OP didnt. Ofc even with context people will still disagree which is fine. But its better than people assuming the original argument was about someone thinking ""cute concepts are inferior/anti feminism and BP is the pinnacle of empowerment  etc etc"". In the end I think some fans took it too personally as an attack on their fav group, when really the discussion should have just highlighted that 9 times out of 10 kpop lyrics (for both guys and girls) are straight trash.",20,0,False,self,,,,,

But what would happen to the industry if another active war did break out between the North and South? If even for a short time?

Even an influx of refugees from the North could dramatically disrupt the entire peninsula. 

I would have to imagine things would cease to be the same...let alone exist at all; among the absolute horrors of deaths that would strike us if Seoul (among many, many other cities/towns) were shelled for even a short while.

I would hope it never comes to that...but then again those with power are always reluctant to give it up in some way or another...especially if them and their entire families revolve around said hierarchy. 


My honest question is: what would become of our beloved idols in the scope of such events? Would the entertainment companies be turned into propaganda machines? Even the idols themselves becoming public figures for a cause?

edit:  This question is more in relation to the Kpop industry as a whole than the ongoing conflicts of the Korean Peninsula and the various vying powers. There is no other place I could find other than here that could at least float the thought of this discussion.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

DJ Friz (worked with Heize) has created such a chill track here and its a crime that it doesn't have more attention. The art in it is strangely captivating as well. 

Other songs I think need more love include:

Hyukoh - Panda Bear (780,000 views) - The lyrics in this song really resonated with me. Hyukoh's voice is just &lt;3 as well.

While the article was written in 2013, even then it was hinted that Min Heejin wanted to expand past the typical SM 'box video' (IMO she has succeeded). I'm not sure if she's the only person in charge but you can definitely see a consistent style in [SM's album and poster design in 2016](http://pann-choa.blogspot.com/2016/06/instiz-sm-min-hee-jins-monthly-works.html).

Anyway, I wanted to ask you guys what you're favorite (and least favorite) art direction has been in kpop. I'm curious as to what people see as good and bad design.

My personal opinion is that SM as a company has the most money/fandom loyalty to experiment with their art direction, which makes for a lot of interesting/cool (but occasionally somewhat ugly) comeback design. In general I'm a fan of EXO's black-and-white (or solid colors) minimalist album designs. I think TWICE is amazingly marketed as well. For example I normally don't notice 'normal' clothes on idols but every ensemble in Knock Knock is something I'd want to wear.",62,100,False,self,,,,,

Post an opinion/view you have regarding kpop and people play devils advocate and reply with counter arguments.

Nothing is necessarily meant to change your view, but it's healthy to sometimes look at things from another view point.

1292,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-4-15,2017,4,15,22,65iyj4,self.kpop,[FAN ACCOUNT] KNK Live Cocert in Tokyo + Hi Touch (4/15),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/65iyj4/fan_account_knk_live_cocert_in_tokyo_hi_touch_415/,charlieedog,1492261264,"**WARNING: This got quite long. Apparently I have a lot of Feelings.**

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I found out that I could go to the KNK concert happening in Tokyo today. After frantically asking around reddit (big s/o to for /u/lilfreaks, /u/theangrycamel, /u/Dessidy for assuaging my fears yesterday haha), the KNK live twitter announced that they would still be selling tickets at the venue. I knew at that moment that I had to go out and Stan Talent. 

&amp;nbsp;

I bought my ticket and made friends with a couple international fans. A lot of people flew in from Korea to see them, and a bunch of them had also been to the Osaka show and were going to the other Tokyo show at 7PM. There was also a lot of fansites selling slogans, fans with names on them, etc. Overall Tinkerbells were super nice and chill. This is definitely one of the chillest kpop shows I've been to, actually.


At 2PM, people were asked to line up by their ticket number. If you're going to a concert in Japan, be aware that **All-Standing does NOT mean General Admission.** It just means that you'll be let in in the order people bought their tickets in, so the sooner you get your ticket, the closer you will be to the stage. Of course, since I bought my ticket at the venue the day of, I was the very last number LOL (1,009) 


As it turns out though, there was two levels, and a bunch of people had opted to go on the second level to see better, so I actually got a great spot in the middle-center of the crowd (and with my heels I could see the stage very clearly). Goes to show that even the 'worst' seat in the house was actually quite good.

&amp;nbsp;

**AND THEN THE CONCERT STARTED!**

&amp;nbsp;

They kicked it off with 'Gone' (By the way, if you haven't treated yourself to [Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uim0JMG9pSE) and [Stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxXkVo-xNIg), KNK's album intros. Treat yourself. You'll thank me later. Also notice that 'choreographed by Jihun' in the title? That's talent you're stanning, my friend.)


They had a mini Intro VCR which... I'm not gonna lie, was a little bit [Coming Soon To Own on Video and DVD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWkkECBurDQ) (Side note, YNB if you need someone to make angsty KNK AMVs for your concerts, I have the Experience. OK moving on). 

&amp;nbsp;

And then they came out for a ment! Now, both my Japanese and my Korean are... bad. So I would say that I understood about 30% of it, though I did get the general gist of what they were talking about. My Japanese level and Seungjun's Japanese level were about the same, so when he'd say ""Minna.... Tinkerbell ... AISHITERU!!!"" I'd be [like](http://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.gif). The others made a pretty valiant effort to use grammar etc. At one point Jihun was like ""Watashitachi ga............................."" *very long pause* and then Seungjun coached him to say ""Watashi Tinkerbell Aishiteru"" lol. Heejun also got flustered while speaking a bit. Heejun's so cute, guys. THE MAKNAE IS PURE!!


They gave small introductions and talked a little bit about what they've been doing. Seungjun talked about the idol show he's going to be on. Inseong showed a picture of this huge ass fish he caught (Seriously, it was fuckin huge...) Inseong's parents were also sitting in the audience at the back and all the Tinkerbells waved to them. Youjin talked about getting ramen at Ichiran (the translator judged him a little for going to a chain restaurant lmao) and also got expensive mochi. I think Inseong and Seungjun also got ramen together at a place where they give you the broth in a bag (???). Heejun said he ate alone somewhere and then Jihun (and someone else) hung out with their manager and their friends.


Then they talked about what they wanted to do in Japan later. Youjin said he wanted to go to Akihabara ~~because he's a fuckin nerd~~ and get an Attack on Titan figure. He also said something about Tokyo Ghoul haha. Seungjun said he wanted to go to Disneyland ~~because he's an actual Disney prince. Seriously, did you know his name used to be Gyeongbok but he was embarrassed by it and changed it to Seungjun? If that isn't some fuckin Flynn Rider nonsense~~ the others also said stuff but it was hard for me to understand.

&amp;nbsp;

I won't describe the whole setlist but they did all their titles, ballads, a couple fun songs, and their fricking godly performance of [DBSK's Bolero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqPZBgWPfOM). At one point Youjin messed up a note and it dawned on me that *holy shit, they're actually singing this live*. In fact, I'm pretty sure they sang the majority of the concert live, and guys, this was a matine concert. They sounded SO GOOD. S/O to Jihun who had a bunch of low-key harmonies that really filled out their ballads so well. He's really the hidden gem of KNK.


In another ment they danced to various girl group songs including TT, Cheer Up, Russian Roulette, Mister (yes, really), and Glass Bead. Seungjun just kept doing [this move](https://media.giphy.com/media/TxLaszKjzIRMs/giphy.gif) even after everyone moved on to talk about something else lmao; They were also forced to do aegyo, because reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

The crowd was probably the most respectful kpop crowd I've been in... ever. In fact, I was a little perturbed because I wanted to scream and be like ""INSEONG KING OF MICROPHONES"" but everyone else was very calm. I didn't even see that many phones out except for one song (there was a fansite right next to me for a little while though. I kept wanting to ask for her twitter but I didn't know how haha). As I said, I was right in the center and significantly taller than most of the audience so I was right in the line of vision for a lot of it. I got to wave to pretty much everybody, especially Seungjun (who was very fanservice-y in general sending hearts to the audience and generally being an adorable oddball) and Youjin (guys, you may not know this, but Youjin's smile........ it's a Lot). Also I tripped at one point and I think Jihun laughed at me. Thanks Jihun.


&amp;nbsp;


**OK... THE HI-TOUCH**

&amp;nbsp;

This was my first hi-touch, and while I knew it goes pretty fast, I thought I might have some time to put in a sentence here or there, like ""Jihun, your dancing is good"" ""Seungjun, good luck with the idol show"" ""Inseong, I like your voice"" etc. We were escorted out of the hall, and I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, but it was certainly not KNK RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DAMN DOOR. I was totally not expecting it and I was holding all my stuff in the hand I was supposed to high five them with, so I stepped aside and made the girl behind me go first while I fumbled to switch everything. The coordinator lady was visibly annoyed and I was so embarrassed that I basically just sped though them without looking too hard. Seriously, I was like a goddamn [marathon runner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.thecrimson.com/photos/2014/04/21/214638_1296439.jpg.800x535_q95_crop-smart_upscale.jpg). I barely remember what they look like, except that they were smiling. Anyway, lesson learned. Be prepared, and also MAKE EYE CONTACT even if it's embarrassing.


Anyway, STAN TALENT. STAN SMALL BUSINESS. STAN KNK!!!! (COMEBACK MAY 2017).",19,82,False,self,,,,,

And an update from the fancafe,

&gt;Hello to all CLC fans from all around the world! I am Sorn and today I have a very special announcement to make. Over the past few months, I have been preparing my very own youtube channel. After talking to the company and with the HUGE amount of support from our staff members, we have created Cubes 1st live streaming channel called &lt;PRODUSORN&gt; which will be another sub channel from United Cube.

&gt; The purpose of this channel is to not only entertain, but to also educate and inspire anyone with a dream to become anything they aspire to be. I welcome ANYONE and EVERYONE to watch my channel. I will be telling you guys my personal stories about the struggles and challenges that I have faced before I became a member in CLC. I hope that you guys will enjoy my stories and find them somewhat helpful.

&gt; My first streaming will be on April 21th @ 7:00pm (KST). If possible, I'll be streaming every Tuesday and Friday. So please make sure to show your support and stay tuned to more updates!!",23,228,False,self,,,,,

Under Lover's new song Flight is gaining controversy as their new song Flight is being said to have plagiarized the melody of BEAST's Ribbon that was released in July. 

Ribbon was the title song for BEAST's 3rd regular album HIGHLIGHT and was composed by Yong Junhyung and Good Life. 

Ribbon was the last song under the name ""BEAST"" for the group and they have since established their own agency Around US Entertainment and have named themselves after their 3rd Regular Album ""Highlight"". 


Earlier in January, Ribbon was the front of another controversy for plagiarism under the rookie group B.Heart. Yong Junhyun took to his Instagram expressing his feelings about having his work copied. 

CUBE has the actual copyrights to Ribbon, stated that if the song has actually copied/sampled the song without the permissions or used it for their own profits, we will make a case, if it does seem that they have plagiarized without permissions.

Around US has stated that they have heard of the news that there is a similar song being distributed that sounds very similar to Ribbon, however the copyrights for the song are split between Yong Junhyun and CUBE. Highlight will also be looking into the song.

The reason I'm posing this question is I'm helping put together a project proposal to actually pursue these investigations and want to show my bosses there are a lot (or not *womp womp*) of content possibilities to sustain and consider. 

This is meant to be about investigative topics that are informative and broad in reach, rather than drama driven. This means things like ""Is X dating Y?"", ""Was Z a bully in the past?"", or ""Does company A abuse their trainees?"" is not what I mean.

Here are some examples in line with what I mean. I just put down what I had from brainstorming, so please share whatever even if it's repeated. 

* How do companies come up with Line distributions? Why do companies do it the way they do?
* What is it like being a manager to idols? We've seen our share of good and bad managers, but what is it really like for them?
* Chart ()""saechigi"" and manipulation. How trustworthy are the charts?
* How involved idols actually are when it comes to the songs, concepts, choreo, etc.? As Zico said the title ""singer-songwriter"" is losing its merit.
* How/where do idols get paid? How does the money flow through the industry? Why are so many idols still in debt or getting paid so little.
* Costs of producing a single/album to an idol agency. Promotion, touring, MV, others... What really goes into the content you get from your bias 
* Idols are trained how to act, and is not their real personality -- how much is the real deal? [There's no way this can be faked, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqVjLIoamRs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m24s)
* Military life for male idols, how they feel going in, what's different when finishing. In Korea, they say you aren't a man until you've come back from service.
* Darker sides to the idol industry: depression, abuses, ""sponsors,"" surgery, etc. 
* Mythbusters-esque suggestions/tests - doing an idol fitness/beauty/promotion/ regiment, etc and what are the results and effects. 

Thanks for any input!

*edit - thanks so much to everybody that commented, this was really a lot of help[.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winterstark/Alot-of-Knowledge/master/alot.png)

I haven't, for the most part. I generally do not seek out a group because I want to see more of or know more about one of its members. The exception to this is Hyuna.

What are your criticisms about the fandom, idols, labels...? Is there something you would do differently? 

My biggest critique is probably how much of the general fandom seem to neglect many important things in life in order to obsess about Kpop. Like, how some teens/young adults are not studying because K-pop is so time-consuming that they are constantly seeking for more content, and more content, and are spending their time in fanwars, streaming videos to get X views in Y hours/months. 

I think it's necessary to find a balance between your hobby and your life outside of it.  Obsession might be just as hurtful as depression (and even a sign of it). Don't stress out about accomplishments or charts or ranking, just enjoy your faves, focus on your studying/work, try to engage in side projects and activities you like. I think this the healthiest way to enjoy Kpop.

I'm sure you don't remember us, but you guys showed us a lot of love so I feel obligatory show thanks... I know it seems like I'm using this to promote our EP (kinda) but more than that, I'm really grateful for all the listens...I think /r/kpop gave us at least 500 plays on our old mixtape.

Old thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3hdhk0/show_me_theno_bring_me_the_money/

Even looking at your comments, likes, give me feels. One of us got a call from SMTM and will hopefully do well :)

I posted so much about what's been happening within our crew, but as soon as I posted someone downvoted, feelings were hurt, and thus the thread deleted. Well I'm back again.

Hate it, love it, would really appreciate it if you guys gave our new EP a listen! Much love &lt;3

Which current trends would you love to see die off ASAP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/66kpxi/what_trends_would_you_like_to_see_catch_on_in/,spectrales,1492722741,"As most of us know, kpop is pretty inclined to adopting trends that last for a while, many but not all of them taken from Western trends (such as the current musical trend of tropical house songs). Then there are more ""meme-like"" trends which occur, such as the ""Sha Sha Sha"" aegyo explosion created from Sana's line in Cheer Up, or the act of dabbing (which somehow still hasn't fully died off yet). So as the title says, are there any trends you would love to see catch on in the kpop industry, gradually *or* suddenly? And on the flipside, are there any current, existing trends it would fill you with unbridled joy to see wither, die, and vanish?

This can include pretty much any conceivable thing that could catch on, be it a trend in music, fashion, types of groups or idols, behavior, aesthetics......anything. There could even be old, forgotten trends that once were everywhere that you might wish were back again.

My personal submission for this would be the musical genre of **electroswing** becoming popular in kpop. A sound that's something like Mamamoo's [Recipe](https://youtu.be/mNYR08plnNo) or to a lesser extent J-Hope of BTS' solo track [MAMA](https://youtu.be/SyAGg5MJTR8) catching on in kpop song production would be like...a wet dream for me. It's obviously pretty far-fetched, though, unless electroswing somehow caught on as a popular genre in the US first.

**EDIT: If possible I'd like to prevent this from becoming just another  90% negativity/criticism thread so, although it's fine to talk about which trends you hate, I encourage you to also include a trend you'd *like* to see, if you can think of one!**",217,113,False,self,,,,,

Translation of caption in post:


I really appreciate the affection you have for me, but I would like to politely ask you to stop standing in front of the studio to wait for me while taking photos sneakingly. It really stresses me when my privacy is invaded and gives me anxiety.

If this continues to happen, I will take serious actions.

1958,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-4-23,2017,4,23,5,66y40x,self.kpop,"[Discussion] Chart-domination, the health of Korean Pop music, and the spread of a new wave in the industry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/66y40x/discussion_chartdomination_the_health_of_korean/,ArysOakheart,1492892222,"What prompted me to start this discussion is seeing that [9/10 songs on iChart](http://i.imgur.com/eOgyHaU.jpg) are all from IU's *Palette*.   is also sitting at #13 at the time of writing; it is the only track from the album that isn't in the Top10.

**My first question** is has there been other instances where a single artist or in even rarer cases like this, had tracks from the one album have dominated the collective charts like this before? I am really interested to read/hear about other similar instances.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now for our long discussion #1**: What are your thoughts/opinions on whether this is healthy for the music industry of Korea or not? 

I think most of us could predict that IU would absolutely slay the charts like this; but at what cost? The Korean public is quite easily swayed by trends perceived and experienced alike; if something looks like it'll be trendy/popular or looks like it *is* then one must jump on it and be part of the majority. This is our collectivist and materialistic culture manifest which I personally see having pros and cons at the same time but that is besides the main point. 

With artists like Taeyeon, Zico, Zion T, IU, (etc.)...it's expected that they will sit comfortably in the top10 of most (if not all) charts on release. Now, for quite a while since the late 90s the charts have mostly been dominated by idol music, popular ballad artists, and OSTs of popular shows. These are predictable characteristics of the top sections of Korean music charts as we know them in the 21st century. This however means that we have a situation where a very select few artists really command the popular music climate of Korea (and I'm aware this is not a phenomenon unique to Korea). 

*Do you see this as fine/healthy for the Korean music climate or do you feel the need to see more diversity in the charts/listening tastes of the greater public within and beyond the circles of popular musicians?*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Discussion #2**: It is only very recently that an observable shift has been noticed in the industry with more indie artists finding their place in the ears of the masses/greater public and the charts. Some argue that the likes of Busker Busker and 10cm really helped push the early wave into the charts and I wouldn't fault them on that. Last year we saw (Bolbbalgan4) pull a surprise streak through the charts with   (Galaxy). This has heralded a shift in the changing tastes of the Korean masses (well at least in the &lt;40 demographics) which has been slowly observed in the preceding years. Even earlier this year Cheeze who [have] edged their position in the popular indie crowd as favourites saw [their] latest track striking into [the top10 in various charts](http://www.msbsound.com/%EB%AF%BF%EA%B3%A0-%EB%93%A3%EB%8A%94-%EC%B9%98%EC%A6%88cheeze-%EC%8B%B1%EA%B8%80-%EC%A2%8B%EC%95%84%ED%95%B4bye-%EC%A3%BC%EC%9A%94-%EC%9D%8C%EC%9B%90-%EC%83%81%EC%9C%84/?ckattempt=1) and that got some experts in the industry talking. 

It's something many have started to really feel in the past few years with a stronger crossover between the indie scenes and popular culture. We are seeing more idols who were once considered (and still are somewhat) part of a separate world in the Korean music cosmos interacting more with and showing mutual support and collaboration with indie artists and producers. You've got  working on IU's latest album, SHINee's Onew singing a now-fanfavourite rendition of 's  , to name two of many instances. Some in the scene see this as 'selling out' with some criticism thrown at (OKDAL) for example when they started getting more TV gigs such as on 's show. 

*Firstly, what are your thoughts on the advent of more indie musicians breaking into the public eye?*

*Secondly, how do you feel about the growing trend of a 'graying' of the boundaries between popular and indie music in Korea?*

I'd love to provide a tl;dr but considering that my questions posed require the contextual bodies of text, I'll just point out that the discussion questions are italicized. If you made it through my winding thoughts vomited here and would like to engage in discussion, feel free to pick only those you do wanna address and post your comments below.

I know that the majority in this sub won't be listening to or have much interest in Korean music beyond idol music, but I know that there are still many that have diversified in their listening, including our fellow WLK community members.

She was helping out the managers.

 Rumors were that she joined MBK in December after leaving Polaris but I guess she was in the company for much longer than that. 

http://www.allkpop.com/forum/threads/a-fangirl-who-got-to-debut-with-her-favs.69045/

In a v-app from this weekend, Somyi mentioned she was a big fan of DIA (fans think her bias was Eunjin lol) prior to joining MBK, and she even had first generation fanclub membership. She applied for fanclub membership in December and four months later ended up joining the group she stans officially.  ~~next level fanservice by KKS~~ Not sure if Somyi auditioned or if she was scouted, but people have been speculating that she was spotted at a fan event.

-Has kpop led you to start listening to Korean artists from other genres, or do you still listen to other genres in English? For example, did you listen to Western rap and switch to Korean rap because of getting into kpop? 

-Has it made you appreciate Western pop more, or has it made you more critical?

*Me:
Before I started listening to kpop (2015 via Red Velvet), all I really listened to was house music and Lana Del Rey and I have yet to get back to them since then. Is there a Korean equivalent of Lana Del Rey?...

I think Western pop is *horrible*. Our girl groups and boy groups are *shit* in comparison, the music is boring, the vocals are sometimes such a gd mess, the looks are a disaster, the members are messy af all over the internet*, the dancing looks like a struggle sometimes...I watched a Little Mix video one time and it was traumatizing for me.

*I know they're probably still messy but I never need to know!",122,119,False,self,,,,,

preferably something a bit unexpected, not the sort of collab that is particularly likely to happen at some point. any language is fine, and solo members/collabs between groups are allowed too! 

this really just came from me suddenly realising that some of blackpinks choreo/singing reminds me of rich girl by gwen stefani and if for some godforsaken reason they covered it, i feel like they'd kill it lmao. 
some of my other ones: i'd love to see jaejoong pull off a gackt cover at a japan concert, since some of his solo stuff is pretty clearly drawing from that type of jrock and afaik they have at least some level of acquaintance. from what i've seen though, he's stopped doing covers at his japanese concerts for now at least. 

it'd also be a sin if gfriend never cover a super junior song, but at least i can have some hope on that one.",52,34,False,self,,,,,

From personal experience, the VIP gift packs are pretty basic things. For example, the Kanye West Saint Pablo tour VIPs got a laminate badge and a poster but they were sent weeks later after the show already ended, so besides merch, you might be leaving empty handed. Rest assured they do send it though.",103,64,False,self,,,,,

LOO is a K-pop group building its own view of the world.

Six members of LOO, HeeJin, HyunJin, HaSeul, YeoJin, ViVi, and JinSoul, have been introduced, and the unit of LOO 1/3, composed of HeeJin, HyunJin, HaSeul, and ViVi has been announced to the public so far.

LOO 1/3 has released [Love&amp;Live]. Filled with sense of youthful love, Love&amp;Live was an album to express their palpitating emotions in the boundaries of contemporary K-pop girl group music of 2017. A month later, LOO 1/3 releases [Love&amp;Evil], a inverted version of the album [Love&amp;Live]. As suggested by the word Evil, which is reversely-spelled word from Live, [Love&amp;Evil], which was planned beforehand during production, is filled with pain and worries in the process of love, in the opposite characteristics of the prior record.

Is love something sweet? Or is it something cruel?

It might be a question too difficult for young girls to answer yet. The title track Sonatine (   ) takes the encounters of love away towards the adolescence of the girls. While Love&amp;Live (, ) was a typical K-pop girl group track with lovely emotions, Sonatine (   ) mesmerizes the audience with mystical melodies unexpected for a K-pop girl group.

The intro track Love &amp; Evil produced by SWEETCH materializes a girl who is lost alone in a dark forest. With the piano played in Accelerando, the girl runs away deeper into the forest.

Four girls then gather to sing a Sonatine to cast an arcane spell of love.

The album continues with a newly released track, Rain 51db (  51db) which is an homage to the first generation K-pop girl groups, S.E.S and Fin.K.L. It also shows their love towards themselves, trying to revitalize the sentiments of the golden era. Like ViVis previous attempt in Everyday I Love You, LOO 1/3 time-travels back to the 90s, with the question of what if LOO was created in the 90s?. They then raise their innocent and pure voices up as if Rain 51db is the original soundtrack to an animation film with a storytelling, singing that they have dreams that they do not wake up from.

HeeJin meets HyunJin, who goes to the same school in the same grade. HaSeul is a warm friend who is like a mother to YeoJin. ViVi, an android who cant speak Korean very well introduces JinSoul in Hong Kong. Each members character is pronounced vividly.

Is story of love that 1/3 girls tell Love&amp;Live or Love&amp;Evil?

A new member will be announced in May to build up a new view of the world. The girls of May, June, and July will be of another unit.

The girls who are lost in the forest have gathered here. Can they save YeoJin?

Recently, I've been listening to the Japanese songs of SNSD a lot more than I used to. Imo i think their Japanese songs are much better than their Korean songs. I personally enjoyed the whole 'The Best' album. This is also down to it being Jessica's last album but still. Anyways my favourites are [Galaxy Supernova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6FPJOgfCkc), [Devine(Jessica's last song :( - We r always 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxj3CsHIE5c), [Karma Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56JP6GonpeE), [PAPARAZZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUqP1xzRZkw) and [Love &amp; Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ex1YkDXelo).

Why do people like this stuff?"" I then started to see K-Pop all over my FB timeline, and the spectacle of the videos astounded me. I was amazed by how different they were from the likes of SPYAIR or One OK Rock, my personal favorite Japanese bands.

Then, a few days ago, my friend starts talking about this group, BTS, and talks about how much story there is in the songs. She linked me a video, Blood, Sweat and Tears. I was amazed by the choreography and how well the group timed their dance moves. At least I thought I was amazed, then I saw how perfectly they timed [this](https://i.gyazo.com/717b2efde9a3bafcbe2dc360936a4b7e.mp4) without even looking at eachother. Jumps are pretty hard to time. I'm no dancer, but jumping and landing at the same time is hard enough while looking, so this seems amazing to me.

The dancing is a huge change for me, as, at least what I've seen, the MV style of J-Rock is so different, and we get videos which are more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcBBNB5JTOQ) in the J-Rock community. So different to the bright, brilliantly choreographed dance moves of BTS.

So far I've only been introduced to BTS, however if they're anything to go off, maybe I'll end up liking K-Pop more than my beloved J-Rock...

The music is so great and has a similar appeal to the one that J-Pop/Rock had when I was first introduced to it. The feeling that although you can't understand it, you know its great, even if unable to explain why.

I'm rambling now, but if you have any questions to ask me then I'll probably be online for a while so ask away!",139,48,False,self,,,,,

Look at Little Mix and Fifth Harmony, mostly female fans. Popular pop artists, ex. Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande, mostly female fans once again. I guess it's because of cultural differences since it's ok for men in Korea to listen to kpop while men typically don't listen to western pop music. I'll admit I find it a bit creepy at times when I see older men expressing their love for idols a lot younger than them. You could probably say that interaction with male idols and their fans can be creepy at times too. But I guess I'm just much more used to seeing stuff like that.
Do you wish female groups were more like in the west with a dominant female fanbase?
Just curious, but also for anyone who's been to concerts with kpop girl groups/artists outside of Korea, what's usually the audience demographic like?",33,0,False,self,,,,,

I started a monthly blog series called ""K-Music Picks"" where I choose five of my favorite releases in the Korean music scene each month and compile them into a list. I don't know if this is something that is allowed on this sub-reddit, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

I've summarized the list below, but you can find the full post [here](https://themarginaleye.wordpress.com/2017/04/29/johans-k-music-picks-april-2017/).

[R&amp;B / Soul] [Suran (ft. Changmo) - Wine](https://youtu.be/g8wlcQTf3p4)
&gt;Wine is an upbeat electro pop song by Suran, an R&amp;B vocalist, and rapper Changmo. The song is about a person seeing the memories of their past relationship through a glass of wine and how they want to move on by letting it flow away.

&gt;This is Surans first song to achieve mainstream success and top the charts in Korea. She has released and been featured in a number of other songs before ([Calling In Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkBsfEw0zbY), [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98IqYFLWZ1I)), but none of them have charted too well. This song actually hit #1 within a day of being released, and this is all the more impressive given the amount of competition that have been dominating the music charts over the past couple of weeks.

[Rock] [Hyukoh - Tomboy](https://youtu.be/pC6tPEaAiYU)
&gt; HYUKOH is a 4-member rock band named after the lead singer, Oh Hyuk. Although they are still considered somewhat of an underground group, a number of their songs have topped the music charts ([Comes and Goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECMc1SB60E0), [Wiing Wiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr4GaRPX6cM)).

&gt;The albums title song is called Tomboy, and it describes the pain and insecurity of youth. Although youth burns brightly, it also has the potential of crashing and burning, as can be seen in the MVs gorgeous illustrations. The music video has no lyrics, so you can find them [here](https://kagasa.com/hyukoh-tomboy/).

[Ballad] [IU - Ending Scene](https://youtu.be/Rh5ok0ljrzA)
&gt;Ending Scene is an emotional, heartfelt ballad from Palette. The song, captured beautifully by the aesthetic music video, takes you through the unspoken words of a couples relationship. From the moment they meet to the last time they touch, Ending Scene will make you bawl your eyes out.

[Dance/Pop] [Lee Haeri - Pattern](https://youtu.be/lH_QqoGqFPU)
&gt;Pattern was one of my favorite songs this month. It has an incredibly unique rhythm and bounce that is powerfully bolstered by Lee Haeris compelling voice.

[Tropical House] [WINNER - Really Really](https://youtu.be/4tBnF46ybZk)
&gt;Really Really is a tropical house-inspired song. Ive never heard a Korean tropical house song before, so this was nice for a change. WINNER definitely brought something new to the table and to the music scene. Lyrics [here](https://popgasa.com/2017/04/04/winner-really-really/).

[Special Mention] [ZICO - She's A Baby](https://youtu.be/ohSpvSGXfhY)
&gt;Shes A Baby is about a guy who likes a girl that has a boyfriend. He says shes a baby because shell get in trouble if you leave her alone all day, but he doesnt want to touch a hair on her head because hell get in trouble if he does. So, he just decides to let her sleep all day. Lyrics can be found [here](https://genius.com/Zico-shes-a-baby-lyrics).

I decided to just focus on the things I liked and thought stood out, rather than trying to give you a complete play-by-play of everything that happened. (If you have a question though, feel free to ask and I'll try and answer). 

***

So, all the messiness of lining up, waiting for wristbands, and other logistical problems aside, EXO gave a fantastic performance last night. I was truly amazed by how great they are. They first opened with the VCR showing their Mama powers (there were a lot of cheers for Lay!), and then they started off with Mama. After that it was Monster (and boy was Baekhyun's dance solo amazing), followed by Wolf. I know that Mama and Wolf tend to get shit on this sub, but I'll just say: Mama is a whole different thing live. The MV's over-the-top nature detracts from just how great they look performing this live. 

After that, I remember them performing White Noise, Artificial Love, and Playboy. White Noise is absolutely incredible live. Xiumin looked great, I focused on him for White Noise because he did a really good job. Xiumin is a really great dancer live, and a good dancer in general; I know EXO already has a solid dance line, but seriously, Xiumin's got some moves! Artificial Love...not to detract from the song, I like it a lot!  But personally watching the performance live, I just couldn't help but wonder how people like it when they dance with the canes because I thought it looked so ridiculous live. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. 

Love Me Right is what I remember next, and they were really great! They all looked so happy, especially Kai. Lemme tell you something about Kai: he's an absolutely charismatic performer live. I didn't pay much attention to Kai before this, but during Love Me Right (and subsequently after that) I paid attention to Kai a lot more. He is so, so captivating to watch live. [He has so much stage presence and charm](https://imgur.com/a/xraQG), and I was totally blown away by how great he was. Kai definitely stole the show for me, without a doubt; I can't believe he was *that* good live. 

[Sehun and Kai also did a little duet!](https://imgur.com/a/BTtma) I think it was during or before they performed Lady Luck, I can't remember. 

During the interlude when they were changing for stages, it was first Kai, Suho, Chen, and D.O. who were on the stage talking to fans. Suho and Chen said they like L.A. a lot, especially the beaches, to which Suho said, ""oh but we need to be careful about the pronunciation!"" Suho also had a lot to say about L.A. That man really loves L.A. so much. He wouldn't stop talking about how much he loved L.A. and how he loves LaLaLand (in fact he sang a bit of it) and D.O. sang a bit from it too! He also mentioned Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and Santa Monica (which is where he went when he was here briefly a couple months ago) and how he loves all those places. He was really happy to have LA as the last stop on the EXO'rdium tour, because he loves L.A. so much and wishes he could visit it here more. He said that L.A. is the place he loves most/his favorite place in the world, besides his home, South Korea. He asked D.O. what he thought of when he thinks of L.A., to which D.O., complete deadpan, just responded ""Hollywood."" I don't know why but I thought that was really funny. I think either he or D.O. also mentioned Pinky's Hot Dogs. D.O. said he really wanted In-N-Out, and that after the concert we should all eat hamburgers. 

After that they went to change and Chanyeol, Baekhyun, Xiumin and Sehun came out. For the most part, it was Baekhyun and Chanyeol doing the talking. They all talked about how excited they were to be in L.A. I can't believe that of all things this is what I remember, but: they were talking about wanting us to dance, and Baekhyun said that when they perform that we should dance naturally and like we were alone in our room dancing to our favorite songs, maybe a little erotically too. They also had Xiumin and Sehun dance for a bit. 

Then they hyped everyone up for Full Moon, Drop That, and Let Out the Beast. Those were all a complete blue because they were so hyped and so excited and it was crazy how much they loved performing throughout. It was amazing the entire time. I know that this sub from time to time also shits on Chanyeol's rapping, but I'll just say this: he's really good at hyping people up and getting people excited when he raps. I don't remember much from that set of songs, but I do remember that in the beginning Chanyeol and Xiumin were rapping and that I was totally amazed at how Chanyeol sounded really good. 

After that, there was a VCR for Sing For You, and finally the moments for the night I had been waiting for: Growl and Lucky One. Lucky Oneeeeee. It's sooooo good live. I had such a good time watching it. They were so good! They had such an amazing time and I'm so happy they performed it because it was a great song to save for the very last part of the concert. D.O.'s head-bobbing is so great, and Suho really enjoyed performing it a lot. 

After that they wrapped up the concert with Angel, but not before some interactions with the fans. The fans sang Happy Birthday to Baekhyun, and that was great, because he looked happy about it. [Chanyeol wore a Deadpool mask](http://m.imgur.com/MOhMG7f) (I don't know why), after which he switched to putting on [an owl mask, and made hooting sounds and flappy wing movements towards D.O.](http://m.imgur.com/TLlwGaw) (again, I have no idea why, all I know is that it was really funny). Angel was great! 

***

So yeah, that's all I had to say! I wanted to keep this short and not say too much, but I really had a great time last night and I'm very happy and grateful that I got to see EXO live last night. It makes me really happy that Suho loves L.A. so much, and I'm glad I saw them live so I could really appreciate just how awesome and amazing Kai is! Krystal is a lucky gal (and Kai is definitely a lucky ~~one~~ guy). Hope you had fun reading this!",33,88,False,self,,,,,

My example would be The Chainsmokers, I first thought there could be a link when I heard the drop from 'Don't Let Me Down' was similar to that of EXIDs 'LIE' - perhaps confirmed recently in an interview where they stated their interest in K-Pop and their wish to collaborate with someone soon!

[**KOREOS**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCniTzJFGV-kvy2GuXQPvdnQ)


They are a dance team from UCLA that uploads dance covers pretty often. They cover most of the popular songs and are one of the best dance teams I've seen.

This is their most view dance cover: [BLACKPINK - Whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFtrl99vWmg)

I personally really like their cover of [Stellar - Sting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ml26Ldc7k). It's interesting watching 4 guys  dance to it and not many people have covered the song :(


[**Heaven Dance Team**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lyazxK9VKJoeBDEUiyjcw)


A really good all-male dance team from Vietnam. I really enjoy watching their stuff and I wish the members had social media presence.

[Twice - TT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-stdAyROs0E)

[Original choreography for a Vietnamese song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRXZXyqnymA). It bears some similarity to Kpop dances which is pretty cool.


**Extra**


This is the best cover of [SNSD - Into the New World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWvh6FCVlRk) that I have seen. They even dance to the remixed version. Unfortunately, I can't find much else by them. :(


[**Classical Musicians React**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPnsmwVKhDJoO7jLKfX0Wxw)


It's pretty interesting watching students of classical music react to Kpop. They have really insightful comments but most of it goes over my head.

[Reacting to MAMAMOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxIMz9oBGOE)


[**Skyline Reacts**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCIaCvm7s1Oi2uPcz6glrFg)
