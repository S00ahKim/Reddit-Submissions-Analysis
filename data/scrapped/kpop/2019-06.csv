46,2019-06-01,2019,6,1,17,bvipil,Beautiful story about a deaf fan with Ren's NU'EST boyband,mangolucky,1559378052,"I'm someone who became a fan around the end of Dejavu.As I joined late and because of real life, I'm not able to participate in the fandom as much as I'd like, but I can say with certainty that I like NU'EST more than anyone.The reason I'm writing this is because of my younger cousin.I think this is going to be long, so I apologize in advance.

My cousin is hearing-impaired.She can hear very faintly when she wears hearing aids, but the ringing is so loud in her ears that even then, she can't hear very well.She wasn't able to adjust to school and ended up leaving school in middle school.She would never go outside and she wouldn't want to meet anyone other than her family.So l cared for her more and looked out for her more, and one thing led to another and I ended up convincing her to become a fan of NU'EST.

She and I both love all five members, but we care just a little more for Ren.You can really see how much Ren cares for fans through his words and actions and he's such a warm person, and I think that's what made my cousin fall deeper for him.She said he gives her comfort.

Though only a few months had passed, my cousin went thraugh changes that were quite big for her.She laughed more and she became a little more active, should I say She'd even go outside by herself to buy albums.My aunt and I were so happy to see that in her.

With the release of this album [WAKE, N], I thought about it for a long time... and then l applied for the fansign event on December 8. I thought itwas going to be the last fansign event of this album so l emptied out my salary for the month and luckily got in, and I gifted that seat to my cousin.I was so happy to see the small changes she was going through after liking NU'EST.

Riding the subway by herself for an hour and a half to get there must have taken a lot of courage for my cousin.I was grateful for the fact that she could do it... I had to work till around the time the fansign ended, so I didn't get to read her texts properly, but while l was working, I saw that she had textedme.I didn't know exactly what it was about but she thanked me for introducing her to Ren.

The next day, I had the day off so I visited her house. I wanted to hear how the fansign was and if she enjoyed it. She told me that when she sat in front of Ren, her mind went completely blank as she sat in front of someone she'd wanted to see so much, so when he started talking to her, she couldn't reply back. She said she started panicking at the thought that Ren might feel frustrated because of her. 
Tears kept forming in her eyes so she had her head down as he signed, but as he was signing, Ren tapped my cousin on her arm and when she looked up, he told her ""Don't cry,"" taking time to open his mouth wide? and enunciate each word. My cousin is able to speak but her pronunciation isn't perfect... but she still said the words she had practiced tens of times at home. ""Thank you for singing. Though I can't hear very well, I watch you very closely. I came because I wanted to tell you that."" That's what she said She was so nervous that she couldn't speak as well as she usually can.
That's when Ren held my cousin's hands tight with an affectionate expression on his ace and thanked her for coming. Saying each syllable slowly and clearly.. She said Ren looked like he was going to cry. And that made more tears come to her eyes
...
Behind them, one of the staff members? motioned for her to move on and she said that Ren quickly wrote a message in her album.
She had been crying so much that she didn't read the message until after she got all the signatures and sat down in her seat, and when she did read his message, she cried even harder...

Hearing her story, I read the message in her album and I cried and she cried too. We're going to like NU'EST forever... My cousin said she's never received such warm interest and care from someone before, so she doesn't know what to do. For Ren, it might have just been him being considerate to one of the many fans he has, but I believe that his warm affection and his beautiful words have saved my cousin. The reason why I'm writing this story long after the fansign event is because my cousin asked me not to tell anyone. 
She was scared that people would say bad things about her. Things like 'How can a disabled person listen to music' or ""You don't even know anything so how could you like idols?' She was very scared that she'd hear things like that. I told her I wouldn't tell. but I was eating dinner with my aunt and cousin yesterday and she asked me if l could share her story on Twitter. 
Though she was still feeling very scared, she wanted people to know. Because Ren thanked her for being brave. She wants people to know how much of a good person Ren is, and how much warm courage he gives to people who are lacking. And that is why I am writing this.

Lastly, to Ren, though this may never reach you. 
It's because you sing such amazing songs looking so beautiful that I got to know you, and my cousin got to know you, and for that, I am grateful. Also, thank you for savingg my cousin. I believe that if Ren and NU'EST continue to be such warm people, you will continue to do even better in the future. 
I will never regret liking NU'EST.
I hope to go to the next concert with my cousin. If we can get seats, of course! 
My cousin and I will always be silently supporting you from behind To the LOAEs reading this right now, thank you for reading my long post. 
Ren's message in album: ""There are many more things that we can see with our hearts. Thank you for being so brave."" 
*The story happened on December 18, 2018 at Dongia Art Hall Fansign.

I've noticed a lot of songs use electronic or just general music or short vocal repetition in place of singing during the chorus. Eg. Me (CLC) , kill this love, Say my name. Don't get me wrong, these and many others I'm referring to are bops, but the first time i listen to these songs, the 1st verse really hypes me up with nice melodies and vocals. Yet sometimes i feel let down, almost disappointed when the bass drops in the chorus with EDM style beats for a quick dance break. I started liking kpop because of it's upbeat nature, much like the golden years of american pop back in 2010 to 2014, I hope that kpop is not heading towards the same direction as American pop, with trap and EDM",1,3

**Interesting Notes:**

* Based on previous Produce history, at least 7 to 8 trainees who ranked in the Top 10 this round will likely be in the debut lineup. For comparison sake, 8/11 (Season 1), 7/11 (Season 2), and 8/11 (PD48) of trainees who ranked in the top 11/12 after the first elimination made it in the final group.
* X is the wild card seat, so it gives a big of wiggle room for a trainee who in in the top 30 now to sneak in come finale time.",50,93

My favorite groups at the time were (and always will be, cause its because of them I got into K-pop in the first place) SuJu, SHINee, MBLAQ, Beast, BigBang, U-Kiss, Block B, GOT7, B.A.P and many more. Im also a big fan of EXO, BTS, iKON, Infinite, Uniq, and WINNER. 

But basically, life got in the way at some point, and I stopped researching new groups, or listening to music at all. Now that my obsession for K-pop came back, I feel like Im missing out so much! 

So I guess my question is, basically, could any of you recommend me some good new era boy groups? Tell me your favorite groups, tell me your favorite songs, tell me about about your bias, tell me everything! xx",7,2

So it's probably more beneficial for the majority of them to reunite temporarily than continue what they're currently doing. I don't think Wanna One will reunite since they're still popular and profitable after disbanding. Also because one of them has already enlisted and the other older members only have a few years before they have to enlist too. So if they don't do it soon it probably won't happen at all. 

I do believe that there will be a Produce 101 version of SMTown/JYP Nation/YG Family concerts/tours in the future though, so all they'd just get back together for concerts only. That way the members and fans can experience reunions and all the companies involved can cash in without a big commitment.",56,21

127,2019-06-02,2019,6,2,16,bvv3ht,"What are Western songs that Koreans would consider to have a lot of ""Han"" and why? What do you consider ""Han"" to represent in the song?",AlphaAsian8,1559461867,"I've googled this and come up with nothing. I also found nothing in kpophelp so I'm hoping I can post this here and the mods will allow it. I hope it can become a good thread for discussion of Eastern and Western cultural perceptions of music, not just a basic song recommendation thread.

I've come to understand the basic meaning of ""Han"" in Korean culture and it has really made me think about how shallow a lot of Western music can be. I still have trouble deciding if the Western songs I listen to would be considered ""Han"" songs/full of ""Han"" by Korean standards or if they just sounds nice to me. I'm an adopted Korean living in the US, but am only now starting to connect with the culture of my birth.

I like the idea of ""Han"" because it makes me want to understand the song for more than just how nice it sounds. ""Arirang"" is incredibly beautiful and so are more modern songs like ""Spring Day."" 

The one Western song that I feel has a lot of ""Han"" would be ""Baby"" by Clean Bandit ft. Marina. 

Superficially, it just sounds like a fun dance song to a Latin beat, but the lyrics tell a sad story of young love that has wasted through time. The music video also shows this element about two women who loved each other as girls, but one chose to leave the other due to social pressure against romance between the same sex. Her one mistake cost her the love of her life and she fully understands this by the end, choosing to dance by herself instead of trying to break up the marriage. At the same time, you can see the bride still has lingering feelings for her first crush, but there is no reconciliation for the two women.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlznpxNGFGQ

I feel like this exemplifies my understanding of ""Han"" from what I have read. There is sadness that must be overcome in some way, but it's not always the Hollywood happy ending. 

A song I would consider to not be ""Han"" or have a lot is ""If I Can't Have You"" by Shawn Mendes. I love this song and think it sounds amazing, but it doesn't really have a story to tell and is more just repeating lyrics about emotions. It's a summer bop that is very shallow when you break it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVITXvCuqeU

Please tell me what you consider a Western song full of ""Han"" and why you think so! They don't have to be in English! Please also let me know if the two examples I used are correct or incorrect and feel free to explain why!",0,0

##CF poll follow-up

In the [May 2019 Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bjvjno/town_hall_may_2019/), we posted a poll in regards to the `CF` content posted on the subreddit. The results are here from that poll. We would like to thank those that participated in the poll.

The results have been enlightening! It has even surprised some of us on the mod team. For the question of whether CFs should be allowed at all, the subreddit is fairly split, but leans in favor of keeping them. Beyond that the trend became much more obvious. The subreddit support CFs that feature a full song or are in a video format.  The subreddit also leaned on not supporting CFs that are only in the form of images and also do not support any behind-the-scenes content, whether in image or video form. 

**[LINK TO THE RESULTS / IMGUR ALBUM](https://imgur.com/a/j3l1hGc)**

We are interpreting quite a strong line in the sand here. To put it in simple terms, /r/kpop is tentatively in favor of CFs *as long as* they are only in video form (especially as music videos).

We believe this is a reasonable line to draw, therefore the CF guidelines we will follow from now on and will be added to the subreddits rules, are presented here.

The previous guidelines for content that would be flaired [CF] on the subreddit:

&gt; Promotional images of artist(s) promoting advertisements
&gt; 
&gt; Promotional video of artist(s) promoting advertisements

The new guidelines for [CF] content for the subreddit based on the voting in this poll:

&gt; Promotional video of artist(s) promoting a product
&gt; 
&gt; Promotional video in the form of a music video

We recognize there is some variation when it comes to CFs in the form of music videos. Sometimes they are a little short, like in the case of Zion.Ts [Butterfly Effect.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp--n0Q0Ur0) Since music videos like these arent terribly common, were comfortable granting some wiggle room. Basically, if it looks and feels like a music video, its okay to post!

The same applies for general CFs in video form. We wont require a certain length or any other particulars, but we will keep an eye on the volume of content this brings in. (Sidenote: We still allow news/announcements of endorsement deals or brand ambassador-ship. That hasnt changed.)

The rule that we are updating:

&gt; **Variety &amp; Misc**: Variety appearances and segment clips including previews; full episodes and teasers for group reality shows; behind-the-scenes videos and v-lives related to an official release; official fan-chant/cheer-guide videos; commercial ads (CFs); official signed album purchase events; editorials and opinion articles.

New rule:

&gt; **CFs:** ONLY post official advertisements/CFs that are in video form or in the form of music videos.

Banned:

&gt; NO advertisements/CFs in the form of images/photos/gifs

&gt; NO behind-the-scenes content relating to advertisements/CFs in any form

##Addressing video and audio piracy (Album Discussion Post Focused)

This is the first step to addressing piracy on the subreddit. We will tackle it with the album discussions first and then we will extend it to video submissions in the July Town Hall.

We will be using ONEUSs RAISE US as the example album as we explain how Album Discussion and Two Weeks Later posts will be compiled.

What is required to make an Album Discussion post on the subreddit?

The submission will be a self post. It will have a submission title format of `ARTIST - ALBUM TITLE`. 

In this example, it will be `ONEUS () - RAISE US`.

In the body of the self post/text post, the following format be required:

    #ARTIST - ALBUM TITLE
    
    **Release Date**: MONTH DD, YEAR
    
    ---
    
    Track | Lyrics by | Composed by | Arranged by
    ---|---|----|----
    1.|TBD|TBD|TBD
    
    ---
    
    **STREAM ON [Apple Music]() / [Spotify]() / [Google Play Music]() / [MelOn]() / [Genie]()**
    

With our example filling in the new format:

&gt; #ONEUS () - RAISE US
&gt; 
&gt; **Release Date**: May 29, 2019

The new format emphasizes using official channels to support the artist. 

The usage of YouTube links is now OPTIONAL. Users who provide official or unofficial YouTube links in their album discussion posts must remember that if they are taken down, they will need to replace it. The rules from before still apply, users cannot put time-stamped unofficial YouTube full album audio uploads. This also means you still cannot submit stand alone Apple Music / Spotify / Google Play Music / MelOn / Genie links as a way to start Album Discussion posts.

If you need to find information to fill the post with, most of the information that is needed can be found either in the MelOn or Genie page for the album.

As for the Two Weeks Later discussion format, it will be identical in format as to the Album Discussion format. It will be a self post/text post.

The submission title will be as follows `ARTIST - ALBUM TITLE (Two Weeks Later)`.

In the body of the self post/text post, the following format be required:

    #ARTIST - ALBUM TITLE
     
    What are your thoughts on ARTISTs latest release now that you've had time to digest it? What are the standout tracks? How has your opinion changed since release? What are your thoughts on the sales numbers and chart positions? How did the release stack up to your expectations?
    
    [Album Discussion Thread]()


Using our example, the post will look like this for the Two Weeks Later discussion post. The submission title will be `ONEUS () - RAISE US (Two Weeks Later)`. 

&gt; #ONEUS () - RAISE US
&gt; 
&gt; What are your thoughts on ONEUS's latest release now that you've had time to digest it? What are the standout tracks? How has your opinion changed since release? What are your thoughts on the sales numbers and chart positions? How did the release stack up to your expectations?
&gt; 
&gt; [Album Discussion Thread]()

If you would like to supplement the Two Weeks Later album discussion post with further information such as polls or chart performance of the albums or tracks, you are welcome to do so. This will be OPTIONAL.

##New Link Flairs Again

Back at it again with link flairs which have been a constant feature in the Town Halls so far this year. If you have ever viewed the `[Misc]`, it can be described as the catch-all drawer, where everything goes that doesn't have a place anywhere else.

We are introducing two new link flairs: `[Performance]` and `[VLOG]`.

What are the guidelines for the `[Performance]` link flair?

&gt; It is a video that neither fits in the `Live` / `Dance Practice` link flair.

**EXAMPLES**

&gt; [BVNDIT - (Dramatic) (M2 Relay Dance)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bse66e/bvndit_%EB%93%9C%EB%9D%BC%EB%A7%88%ED%8B%B1dramatic_m2_relay_dance/)

&gt; [GUMMY - Songs in 100 Secs (Dingo)
&gt; ](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b3oaou/gummy_songs_in_100_secs_dingo/)

What are the guidelines for the `[VLOG]` link flair?

&gt; Artist uploaded VLOGs onto their personal YouTube channels

**EXAMPLES**

&gt; [Tiffany Young, Seohyun, Taeyeon - Acoustic Seoul Vlog (190529) [RAW / ENG]](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/buarh3/tiffany_young_seohyun_taeyeon_acoustic_seoul_vlog/)
&gt; 
&gt; [Baekhyun's VLOG (CBX MAGICAL CIRCUS/My Travel Essentials/Laptop/Japan)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/btzo9o/baekhyuns_vlog_cbx_magical_circusmy_travel/)
&gt; 
&gt; [Super Junior () Heechul () - Sexy, Free &amp; Single I'm quite sexy man (Feat. Saju Specialist) @ HEEtube  YouTube Vlog (190422) [ENG SUB]](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bt8rhp/super_junior_%EC%8A%88%ED%8D%BC%EC%A3%BC%EB%8B%88%EC%96%B4_heechul_%ED%9D%AC%EC%B2%A0_sexy_free_single_im/)

If the video looks more like a `Behind-the-Scenes` video than a `VLOG`, flair accordingly.

##Jumping the Gun Rules (for image albums)

An issue was brought to our attention regarding the posting of image albums. This arises the most frequently with sets of teaser photos. We prefer images to be compiled into one post whenever possible. It cuts down on clutter and helps fans find everything they are looking for in one post rather than many.

This can get tricky when users are trying to be the first to post freshly released image content. They might jump right in to submitting a post with only one image and then keep adding the rest of the set afterwards. Sometimes users who do this fail to complete the set, which then causes confusion for users and mods when more submissions come in, which have a complete set. What do we do? Message the OP of the incomplete post endlessly to finish the set? Remove the post in favor of a complete one? Let multiple posts remain with partial sets?

In hopes of avoiding this mess entirely, we are giving top privilege to those who submit complete sets of images. If you submit a post and keeping adding images afterwards (we will check timestamps) we will absolutely remove your post if someone else submits a post with a full set after you.

##Shitposting Sunday Thread (Trial)

Due to the success of this years April Fools Day, we are going to trial a new weekly thread for Sunday. We are introducing Shitposting Sunday. Its a place for users of the subreddit to post their memes and shitposts that arent normally allowed on the subreddit. It will be a moderator created thread and this trial will run for the month of June. So, there will be five Shitposting Sunday threads.

---

##Moderator Applications Open Once Again

Back in March, we had opened up moderator applications. From that recruitment, we had added five new moderators. They are still around. But we need more hands on deck. There are still time zones that we need to fill.

What we are looking for:

&gt; **Experienced with reddit and /r/kpop**: We are looking for experienced redditors with an account that is at least 1 year old. We also prefer users who have contributed productively to this community whether that be with submissions or just thoughtful comments.
&gt; 
&gt; **A firm interest in K-Pop and the subreddit**: We want people that are knowledgeable and interested, so obviously you need to be a fan of K-Pop. You should also have a desire to make r/kpop a better subreddit and be engaged in discussions like Town Hall.
&gt; 
&gt; **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators**: You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our discord, modmail, and backroom sub, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members.
&gt; 
&gt; **Free time**: You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to carry out moderating duties.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thick skin**: K-Pop fans love to promote and discuss their favs. When they are not allowed to do so because of our rules they can get rather salty. So be prepared to shrug that off.
&gt; 
&gt; **BONUS POINTS**: We need extra help between the hours of 10AM - 6PM UTC (7PM - 3AM KST). If you are available and have access to moderate from a PC during those hours, please apply. It is not required that you have these hours available to get accepted, but anyone who does will be given an extra close look. We are also looking for an individual that is fluent in the Korean language to help with some of our projects. This individual should be able to converse in an informal and formal situation in Korean.
&gt;
&gt; **EXTRA BONUS POINTS**: Previous experience moderating a subreddit.


What are the daily duties of being a /r/kpop moderator:

&gt; Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.

&gt; Answer subscriber questions in modmail.

&gt; Enforce the subreddit rules.


**[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/9e8qyiLp2HUwA7JQ6)**

The application has several open-ended questions. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered. You don't need to write an essay, but you'll need to put some effort into them. None of the answers will disqualify you, so please be honest and accurate with your responses.

I wanna share this idea which has been stuck in my head for almost 5 months now. 

I wanna build a Twitch kind of streaming/video website which is only dedicated to K-POP community. 

I know Youtube is out there dominating the scene now but it would be so cool to have a website which represents K-POP community.

Should I burn my weekends to implement this website or nah?",4,0

I plan on committing my entire summer into writing a paper regarding Korean culture through K-pop- i.e.  sunbae-hobae, mat hyung-maknae, etc. I would like to know your opinions on how K-pop has widened your knowledge on Korean culture. Especially for international fans who have little background on Korean culture prior to K-pop. 

And if any of you would be willing to participate in the survey and/or online interview that I might be conducting! 

I just find it interesting how traditions are seen in how Idols present themselves as well as how they promote and interact with their fans, other idols, and their companies.

299,2019-06-04,2019,6,4,7,bwgvka,"Solution to ""Reaction"" channels",Kidd_Flash,1559600311,"Back in 2006 was when I got into K-Pop and Korean Variety Shows (Big Bang, 2NE1, SNSD, Family Outing) and was pretty much the only 5 people in my school that liked K-Pop. Even a lot of the Asian girls in my school weren't SUPER into it though they have heard about it. 

But now we're in a new age where K-Pop is getting more and more exposure, and in come the reaction channels. I didn't have a favorite one, but just enjoyed watching other people's reactions. 

Nowadays, I have a few problem with reaction channels:

1) Sure, they may like the song. But It seems they do it for views and subs.

2) How many of those people that ""react"" to the song actually say ""Wow, this song is so good, I'm going to buy it on ITunes right now""? 

And that's whats bugging me. It seems like the reaction channels are the only ones benefiting from reacting to the songs and not the groups themselves. Because at the end of the day, they're just watching it one time despite the reaction channel getting 1000, 10000, or 100000 views. Those views for the reaction channel aren't translating to views for the music video. 

So my solution would be for youtube to take a part of whatever ad revenue they're making from their ""reactions"" and giving it to the group's music label. That ensures both sides are benefiting and not just one. Some may argue that these reaction channels are giving idol groups ""exposure"" in return, but I disagree with that.",17,0

It must make them so uncomfortable. 13 year old girls commenting on every single insta-post of sunmi ""step on me"" in all-caps. Everyone calling her the queen of gays or something like that. Do international fans (I\`m one as well) not realise that the chance of one particular idol being gay is incredibly low? Of course with the hundreds of idols, there should be some. But chances are that neither sunmi nor any of the twice members belong to the lgbt community. Also, imagine if an idol was part of the lgbt-community and everyone would just be like ""F\*\*k you, I want you to be hetero so thats what you are"". Everyone would have a problem with that. So why should it be okay the other way around? Can anyone who participates in this behavior/fan culture give me arguments as to why it\`s okay?

559,2019-06-06,2019,6,6,2,bx50l4,Suggestion - A designated weekly foreign pop thread.,1smore,1559754345,"Hi. So first timer here. I was browsing around internet looking for international pop and ended up here. Finding Korean pop is nice but I would not mind finding music on a wider scale. I'm not sure if I just need to go elsewhere or if we can do something here. Something small that does not overpower but gives a bit of flavor.

Would be interested in a weekly designated thread where people could post their favorite foreign pop songs. The idea would be to get a taste of something new. The songs would not need to be necessarily new since they are ""new"" to the wider audience. In order to minimize redundancy I would however advice against posting main stream English songs. The songs could be either in native language but also in English if they are not in global music charts. Maybe you would like ""Foreign Friday"" thread or something along those lines. If you like the Idea cool. If not no hard feelings I'll just show myself out.

Hear me out.,Kpooper123,1559785921,"Blackpink members are psychopathic murderers and they are taunting the world with their crimes. The first album starts with Whistle obviously to lure innocent victims in. Right after they describe vividly with Boombayah of how they killed their victim. Playing With Fire was their way of making fun of the police they are clearly playing with fire by confessing yet the police are so useless. After their victims were hooked. They taunt their victims with As If It's Your Last to increase the fun of watching their victims struggle. After killing the victim they sang Stay as a homage to the crime not the victim. Clearly in the song they said your scent is like a felony. Clearly giving the hint that they are committing a felony. After, this crazy hint, they went into hiding for two years thinking that their crimes would meet swift justice. To their surprise people praised and loved the music. Which did nothing but embolden them to commit even more murders. They then released Square Up, this time LITERALLY pointing the gun at the audience and shoot at them. And even after the shooting they even hint that all their victims stay young forever. Clearly a confession, yet thinking that people will still be thick they even included Really , telling us they really  did it, and still they were afraid people would not listen. So they also included See You Later and the last line of their entire EP was see you later maybe never. Taunting the police yet again. But things are even worse this time. People love them even more. Confused and blindsided they try to come up with a solution. The answer was SOLO, thinking that maybe they are having the cheerleader effect on people they decided to split up and confess their sins by themselves. Some how people showered them with more love. Which leads to the latest album. Kill This Love was a plead to people to stop loving them and see that they are murderers. They wanted people to stop loving them immediately, hence the immediate outtro in the middle of the song. At this point they are so confused and frustrated they had to vent to the world with Don't Know What To Do.  And yet people are so hopelessly in love they literally just had to say fuck it with kick it. It does not matter any more and at this point they are just hoping people would just not be anymore stupid.",4,0

**# FAQ**  
**### How The Chart Works:**  
**These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.**

686,2019-06-07,2019,6,7,5,bxlb6h,The narcissism and entitlement of shippers,BlinkTwiceforRV,1559851539,"I am getting increasingly frustrated with the shipping culture in K pop. It is the sheer arrogance of those that ship that bothers me the most. Do other fans feel alienated from fandom because of this?

Take Blackpink for an example. Jennie and Jisoo are like sisters, they have specified this many times. Yet there are fans that have sexualised their relationship from the beginning. Its such a lack of respect to do this, especially as they state that it is a fact that they are dating and are LGBT. They have made it clear what the nature of their relationship is, yet so called fans disregard this. I cant in to say how offensive that is. Then there is the whole Jensoo vs Jenlisa ship wars, that are downright vicious and dont take into account the feelings of any of the girls. They are all touchy feely and affectionate, completely understandable considering how long they have been together. Blinks were the first ones to call Jenkai fake!! 

I dont understand why people feel the need to project their fantasies on to idols. Whats the point? What is achieved by it? Whether it is straight or gay shipping, it is completely out of order. I cant see a post about Lisa without seeing a Lizkook comment that goes with it. No wonder male and female idols barely look at each other.

As a member of the LGBT community, I actually find the same sex shipping really hurtful. Straight people fetishise and treat it as a joke, and then LGBT shippers cross the line by wishful thinking and ostensibly trying to out people, whether they are gay or not. LGBT idols will not be out and thats completely understandable considering South Korea is not progressive when it comes to this. Besides, the idea band members cant keep their hands off each other in public and would do anything to out themselves on v live, on IG etc is absurd. 

Sorry for the rant, but its really been bothering me, especially as its getting worse. I wish people would stop dehumanising idols like this.",6,0

Gotta give it to Solar as the most productive and most interesting, she posts like every day on various things with English subs.

What I want to see though is Nana's channel...I'm getting great charisma vibes from her watching her in the kdrama 'Kill it', plus she seems to speak english and even japanese...will be interesting. Oh and wish Dara will more english speaking/subbed content.

I got into KPOP in 2008. This was when I was in grade school. When I stepped to high school, I got bullied because I liked KPOP. It all started because I posted Girls Generation rocks in Facebook. My HS classmates perhaps saw that post and the next day, they shamed me for posting it. They said You like KPOP ewww, I dont want to be friends with you because you like KPOP. Because of this, my first two friends in HS did not talk to me ever because I was a kpop fan. I got sad of course. This resulted in my denial that I like KPOP whenever someone asks me if like KPOP.",8,9

I believe last year's MAMA was one of the biggest audiences Mamamoo have ever performed in front of ....so I was proud of them for putting on such an amazing performance and gaining so many fans which is what prompted me to ask this question. 

For me personally, I would love for Mamamoo to perform like they do at Immortal songs. As much as I love their award show stages, they definitely don't show their full potential imo. Every time a non-fan watches an immortal songs performance you can see how they're immediately converted lol so I would love for them to go all out with the vocals and sass. 

SO what's something that you would love for your bias or bias group to show off at an award show performance?",14,19

I'm curious also how someone would pronounce names that you can never spell wrong, like: Jackson, Johny, Sana, Sakura. Maybe Sana can be ""seina"" lol...if someone is wierd enough to think of an english variant. I also thought 'Jennie' should be 'Jenni e' but never spelled it any different than Jenny (as in jennifer lopez...).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA520AS1Hzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA520AS1Hzc)

&amp;#x200B;

This got me thinking, since it's no secret that the industry worships youth and beauty like no other most idols will struggle to find popularity in their 30s, she is 31 now so 30 in the video maybe but damn...her beauty is still out of this world, so it makes me wonder for how many years can someone as pretty be popular solely based on beauty?

&amp;#x200B;

I also got to give it to Turbo's Jungkook for his body in his 40s, though facial-wise I think he looks around his age despite the good skin and all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dara (34 in western years) is sexy as hell too but disagree with the common notion of ""baby face"", she looks more or less in her 30s but still maintains good facial features. It seems as if they're really pretty as in Gain's case it doesn't matter as much?",104,39

&amp;#x200B;

There have been, and continue to be, random suggestions that BTS should be exempted from military service.  I suspect that quite a few folks believe that BTS are more valuable for the nation's image and pride (and economy, though that bit is whispered more quietly) as global musicians than as conscripted servicemen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surely BTS isn't the first group for whom this discussion has occurred. They won't be the last.  

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if it's time to start thinking of criteria to determine whether a popular musician should be exempted.  For athletes and classical musicians, I'm told that exemption comes with winning prizes or medals in certain competitions.  What would be a suitable bar for popular musicians?

&amp;#x200B;

In a different forum, I suggested that people who receive the Korean Cultural Award of Merit could be exempted.  I was told that the decision to induct people into this order is political, so no, that won't work. I totally get that.   I have heard others suggest that winning certain Billboard Music Awards (**not** Top Social Artist!) could be a workable standard.  However, I wonder whether the Billboards are too American -- surely the threshold needs to be an international one.  Also, I am a bit leery of awards that are based on sales, even if only in part. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you folks have any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

Note:  if this thread devolves into ""Will BTS serve or won't they?""  or ""Should BTS serve or shouldn't they"", I'll delete it.  I'd really love it if this thread could focus on the narrow question that I have asked.",44,0

Possible, but takes effort. K-pop is all around me because I am a member of LGBT community and I get to know it by proxy. When I ask people I know, some say that ""it is just pop that is Korean"", while others say that ""omg people there are perfect everyone is hot"". I mostly get these 2 replies. So I am interested what makes k-pop special. 

Example from my galaxy of metal: There is classical metal like Metallica who set the genre, and there are variations. For example, I like symphonic metal because it incorporates sounds of symphony with metal. It is not just ""violins snapped on top of some metal"", it takes some effort to mix the 2. If I just added some classical music to Nothing Else Matters, it would be clearly 2-layered and incohesive. But bands of actual symphonic metal do it well in their own songs.

And given that k-pop made itself into such a massive culture, obviously there is more to it than ""pop that is Korean"". For example, why didn't PSY set the culture back in 2012 same way most Korean idols do now? Just my observation.",38,19

I know Red velvet can compete on the chart if the song is GP friendly but Twice is like automatically acknowledged by Knetz. I also dont want BTS or Bp come back same time because all the focus and trending topics is on them. And we would have no chance for music win Cus they dominate YouTube. 

Let me know who is your favorite group and what would you like to avoid. This is for fun so no need to be serious ",51,7

I know that people would do anything to meet their k pop idols but is it just disgusting to use other people just to see their faves?

  
I want your opinions on this one but before that here is my experience regarding this situation:  


I have been a fan of Twice. They are going to have an upcoming concert here. Sadly, tickets have been sold out.  


Now this story takes place before the ticket selling. I have a cousin who is also a fan of Twice. We were supposed to go to the concert together but I wasn't sure when I would get my money. I told her that I would tell her if I could get it I would also buy a ticket if I can't then I won't.  


Now the thing is I made a promise to her that I would accompany her, whether if I buy the ticket or not, because she doesn't want to be alone when buying the ticket. I agree to accompany her. I ended up getting my money but not buying a ticket because my parents wouldn't allow me to go to the concert. Huge oof. Keep in mind I told her I wasn't able to buy tix but I agreed to accompany her.  


Fast forward to the day before the ticket selling. She texts me. I was furious because I found out the reason why she wanted to be accompanied, she wanted to split up. She wanted me to hold up her line on one area so that she could meet up with other people (maybe some friends but she mentioned something like contest winners) to also fall in line to buy tickets. Her plan was for me to update her if the line was slow or fast so that she could leave the other line so she could come back to meet me at the line that I was supposed to be in.  


I got mad and asked her why didn't she tell me about the people she was meeting up with. I didn't agree anymore on accompanying her.  


Now consider the factors here:  
1. I have no money to buy a ticket so it could be humiliating to fall in line  
2. It's disrespectful to the other people falling in line because if it DID happen it would be technically cutting in line  
3. What if an emergency happened?  


Now back to the question: Do you think it's right to use/take advantage of other people or yourself just so one can see their favorite k pop idol? I have also read in some occasions where people prostitute themselves to drivers to take them to events/concerts.  


I know I shouldn't be thinking about this really hard but I wanna know what you think. I just got pissed because someone was willing to use me to waste my time and that she lied to me.",4,0

So, after several years NCT127 and Red Velvet return to the Philippines as part of a festival lineup. Was it worth the wait? Definitely.

TLDR: NCTZENs and Reveluvs rocked the Mall Of Asia (MOA) Arena for 2 and a half hours

Apologies to Elris/JBJ fans as I'm more familiar with the 2 SM groups who performed at the concert. Nevertheless, the 2 supporting acts gave good performances and were clearly enjoying the crowd's energetic response.

**Concert Highlights**
What stands out for this concert is that the emcee/translator was local Korean host/actor/comedian [Ryan Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Bang). Translating directly from Korean to Filipino, he would liven up the ments conducted Q&amp;A style with funny comments, eliciting laughter from the well-packed (but not totally sold out) venue. In between acts he would hype up the audience, and it worked well. He also got NCT127 and Red Velvet to say ""We love you"" in Filipino to everybody's delight. 

Also, [Sharon Cuneta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Cuneta), the Megastar of Philippine showbiz was watching for NCT127. Imagine seeing an A-list Hollywood celebrity attending K-Con, this is the Philippines equivalent. The cameras would cut to her reaction during NCT127's ment and she was totally fangirling over the guys. Too bad she left after NCT127 finished their performance.

Superhuman live is freaking great! 

Camerawork for Red Velvet wasn't great, during Moonlight Melody the camera would lose track of the currently singing member. At some point I just watched the girls directly, ignoring the monitors entirely for the rest of their set.

The energy of the audience was amazing. Everyone was in a mood to have a good time and didn't let a couple of technical glitches (some annoying microphone feedback during ments, poor spotlight coverage on the main stage left people's faces in shadow) detract from the experience. In between one of Kim Dong Han's songs, he tried speaking to the audience directly in Korean, but since Ryan Bang was offstage and not listening, there wasn't any translation. So the whole audience started to chant 'Kim Dong Han' instead. All the acts appeared genuinely pleased by the intensity of the cheering.

Red Flavor brought down the house. The power of that song.

Ryan Bang asked Red Velvet what they'd like to do in the Philippines on holiday (if given the chance):

Yeri - eat fruits like fresh mango

Wendy - when she was little she went on holiday with her family to Cebu, she'd like to return to Cebu

Irene - (mishearing the question due to the really loud cheers) perform a concert, at which point the audience chanted 'Solo Con'. Irene was taken aback, but she smiled and did the pinky promise gesture. Afterwards she said she'd like to try Filipino food (an Irene x Jollibee endorsement would devastate McDonald's, ISTG)

Joy - her younger sibling studied in the Philippines, she'd like to explore with her sibling on holiday

Seulgi - go see Manila Bay and explore the beautiful beaches

This is the 3rd time I'd seen Red Velvet live and each time they perform consistently well (the CD-eating comments are well-deserved). Can't wait for SMTown Tokyo in August to see them again!",4,55

1092,2019-06-10,2019,6,10,17,byv8lo,I'm done with Produce X,caratrash,1560154532,"I followed the end of PD101 season 1, was there for all the little memes and hype of Season 2 from start to finish, and followed all of Produce 48. I feel like as the seasons go on, the more biased the editing is towards or against certain trainees. For example, the audition clips this season shows so little of each audition, add too many reaction shots of the mentors and trainees in between, etc. There have also been some issues previously discussed here with Mnet correcting the audio of some trainees to be better or worse on TV. (another thing is a matter of personal taste, we keep on getting shown cutesy trainees doing aegyo and it's not really my style). 

After watching the Chinese version of produce shows (Produce 101 China, Produce Camp 2019) and coming back to watch Produce X, I felt like I got whiplash from how much biased editing, unequal screentime, and audio manipulation there was. The Chinese versions were *much more* fun to watch because it highlighted the cooperative aspect of the show: we got to see the trainees bonding over the difficult concept evaluation performances, having fun hiking along a beach together, and even perform stages with famous male and (gasp) female stars like Pinky of Pristin and Cheng Xiao of WJSN. Compared to watching an awkwardly forced and edited confrontation of ""who the center will be,"" I feel like the Chinese versions of this show did a much better job of representing the trainees and the actual friendships they formed in these difficult conditions. 

All in all, I am pretty disappointed with Produce X. I feel like they don't even try to hide how forced the editing of the show has become. Does anyone have any alternative reality shows to watch instead of Produce X? I'm just really not feeling it.",5,4

I've seen Youtube comments saying they're not a fan of Jisoo, Rose, and Taehyung's voices (in separate videos ofc) and honestly when I listen to them in certain songs I can see (rather, hear) why they might not have liked their voices.  I also thought that I would never dislike a singer's voice in kpop **ever,** until I heard I.N's voice in Miroh. (His parts just don't *seem* right to me even if there's really nothing wrong with the vocal work done. (I like his personality and other perfs tho)

(Also, reasons why people didn't like the three I mentioned earlier included having a weird deep voice, a straining kind of tone, and that the singer's raspy voice makes them uneasy.)",275,32

1206,2019-06-11,2019,6,11,14,bz8ibm,GIRLGROUP DREAMTEAM,chaeng_,1560231005,"here is my gg dreamteam:
1. RED VELVETs Seulgi ( leader )
2. BLACKPINKs Ros ( main vocal )
3. LOONAs Yves ( main dancer)
4. TWICEs Chaeyoung ( main rapper )
5. ITZYs Ryujin ( visual )
-
this is just for fun and i wonder what other ppls gg dreamteam would be. 
rules are :-
1. only two members or less from each gg are allowed to be chosen.
2. it would have to be their actual position or the position they suit to be in the group 
3. they would have to compliment/ blend well together as a group.
4. only 5 members are allowed in the group.
-
p.s i challenged myself to only pick groups that debuted 2010 and above ( 3rd gen ).
i also challenged myself to only pick one member from each group.
i also think that the members i picked will have good chemistry together. 
ok im interested in other ppls gg.
feel free to participate :)",1,0

I usually dodge the question of what kind of music do you like to something like, I dont think you know it or say r&amp;amp;b. I dont know what it is but, I just dont like telling others that I like it. Im not embarrassed by it, but I feel like people already have prejudgments about me based off that fact. I dont want to have to go through the why do you listen to them if you can understand that they are saying or you only like them cause of their looks. I also dont really talk about it with my friends unless they themselves are kpop fans; which is barely any of them. Does anyone else have his problem, or is it just me?",135,211

(week 45),ThisGuyKpops,1560267427," Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2. for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",10,11

Red Velvet **Rapper Bias**: Yeri, Rapper BW: Irene

basically I like Wendy and Yeri but not in the same way so they're in different categories. another on for boy groups:

GOT7 **Variety Show** **Bias**: BamBam, BW: Jackson

GOT7 **Rapper Bias**: Mark, BW: BamBam

if you can think of other categories (**Dance**, **Make Up**, **Styling**, **Visual**, **Absolute Meme-yness** etc.) feel free to list it down. If you think you're bias *seems* to be an unpopular fit for that category you can explain if you like.

If you're unfamiliar with the greatest kpop fan project, check out our youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ) and our winter release [here](https://streamable.com/wx95y)!

&amp;nbsp;

And **DON'T WORRY!!!!!** Our spring release (Gfriend's ""Navillera"") is in final stages of production and teasers will be starting VERY SOON! I just happen to have some time and figure there's no reason we shouldn't be overlapping voting and editing to get some mediaplay going about our next comebacks. So let's vote!!!

&amp;nbsp;

The song options for this round are limited by the artist (BTS' title tracks - duh) and the season the songs were released (April-Aug) so please don't fuss too much about your favorite being excluded! We really wanted to put out a super upbeat, fun, HYPE song this round, so get your rap personas ready and [let's get this bread](https://media2.giphy.com/media/l0ErBfFLUMPoq3WbC/giphy.gif)!

All this, considering 2014 is also the same year that (for example) GOT7 released Girls Girls Girls with their sort of styling and music that is straight up 2014.

They gather millions of votes and the debuted group has always been pretty successful (and a guaranteed rookie of the year). S2 may have had the most overall support so far but each season has a loyal and unique following of their own. A lot of people may have only watched one season, but regardless, it seems to always make an impact seeing how so many people get heated up during eliminations and in supporting their pick (to the point of attacking other trainees). Through just one show, an unknown trainee that may not even have a company can become one of the most well known figures in kpop. Even in r/kpop, in threads mentioning emotional moments in kpop or memorable performances, a lot of the responses are from Produce.

What makes the Produce shows different? And why do you watch Produce? What do you think the future of Produce will be? (especially considering the fact that contract lengths seem to keep increasing)",38,30

Singing and/or rapping while dancing is pretty much the lowest common denominator across the board for being an idol. What idols go above and beyond this and have mastery of more than one discipline, such as singing, rapping, dancing, composing, visuals, etc.

Taeyong from NCT is THE full package for me. Excellent rapper, truly outstanding dance skills, pretty good singing ability, has a lot of writing experience, and is one of the most visually striking members of NCT. He does hog the spotlight unfortunately, but it's hard to deny that he is extremely talented in many areas. The8 from Seventeen is also a solid triple threat (singing, rapping, dancing), although I wish we heard him a little more often in Seventeen's songs. Also, while not necessarily all being the ""full package"", a lot of the LOONA members are competent in singing, rapping, and dancing, as LOONA doesn't really have traditional member positions.",144,69

You of course dont have to answer them directly but they should serve as a general idea for if you dont know what to write about. 

What members would be in it? 

-	Male, female or mixed?
-	Age range?
-	How many?
-	How would their personality be like? (Are they more serious, funny, do they mock each other a lot, trying to be cool, etc.)
-	How many dancers/rappers/singers/visuals? 
-	Any members with special talents? 

What style would they have? 

-	Are they high fashion, street wear, regal, etc. looking?
-	Would there be a common theme with their styling across all comebacks?
-	What would they wear in their everyday life? 

How would their songs sound like? 

-	Do they have drops or are their songs melody focused? 
-	Whats their primary focus (dance/rap/singing) 
-	Are they more Jazzy, EDM, Rock, Pop, Hip Hop...? 

Would they have an overarching theme and if so what would it be? 

-	Examples: WJSNs Dream Girl like theme, Dreamcatchers Horror theme, Cherry Bullets Gaming theme

What would be their concept? 

-	girl crush/bad boy/cute or something new (get creative!) 

What would their debut be like? 

-	Song title
-	Feeling of the song 
-	Styling (Prominent colors, Accessoires, etc)

Based off of your answers, do you think theyd hit big or would they stay a very niche group and why so? 

-	Would they win any awards and if so after what time?
-	How many YouTube views would they get within the first 24 hours? 
-	Would other idols genuinely like their songs?",1,0

I'm wondering if there are any prominent or outspoken Kpop Idols who know a lot about more complex, non-industry topics? I.e. economics, foreign policy, or are perhaps activists in a field? Like environmentalism?   


I understand younger Idols are till finishing school. However others have graduated for many years. Also, some have served in the military - I'm assuming this introduces them to geopolitics and foreign policy?  


I also assume just like any industry in the world - the Idols have obscure hobbies, and some might include world politics, or chemistry or economics...  
One example I can sort of point to, is I've heard Jennie from Blackpink reads a lot of books? and considers herself a feminist.   


I'm curious if folks from this subreddit are familiar with this? Thanks for reading.",78,34

The video doesn't have eng sub so I'm not sure if I am allowed to post this, but I wanted to address the really grueling nature of trainee life, especially with pdx101 airing right now. The girl with the dyed hair trained for 5 years from 16 (international age 14), the boy trained for 1 year starting from age 20 (18), and the other girl trained for 6 years age 17 (15). 
Maybe because they trained longer, or maybe because standards for girls are far harsher, the girls talked a lot more about harships. 
Some of the things they mention:
-Having to lose weight. The black haired girl talks about being told that she would never debut if she isn't 38kg. She remembers throwing up. The other girl nods and mentions that they would spit or blow their nose and have others pull their hair up to make the weight criteria.
-employers pinching their fat and heavily body shaming them
-Workers/trainers talking harshly on them, which causes them to lose confidence and feel depressed and feel like their dream is being crushed
-having to be competitive for most things
-taking Variety classes where they play games that are played on variety shows, and that it was tough to understand at that young of an age
-when they left, they felt as if their dream was crushed, and that they still feel trauma (the dyed hair girl said she struggled to eat properly for a long time even after she quit)

One of the comments said ""omg. 38kgs. If this was a foreign country, this would already be reported as child abuse""

I feel like a lot of people get into kpop because of how bright it is, although lately with so many scandals it's getting pretty tainted, but I think that it's also important to realize and talk about the flaws in the system. Perhaps the severe weight loss is due to society's demands, but they were literally kids. I'm not saying kpop is bad, because it's good, it helps a lot of people feel happy and bond. But it has problems that we have a responsibility to address and fix. I know the video isnt subbed, and that my run down is probably biased (especially cause I mainly did it from memory and wrote what stood out to me), but I wanted to start a discussion and see what other people's thoughts were on the ""other side"" of kpop.",68,233

this has been a trend for a hot year or so now but ... im still curious. any kpop unpopular opinions that you have? 
FYI: saying i think ___ is the best dancer/singer/rapper in ____ or i think___ is better than ___ at ___ isnt an opinion. stating which member you believe is the best dancer isnt an opinion, its your guess at whos the best dancer... and you can be wrong.... 

here are mine:
- red velvet has the best discography in sm
and even though they dont hold a candle to bp and twice in terms of global popularity their quality of art makes up for it
- kpop fans shouldnt speak about jpn/kr/cn issues especially ones that are related to their history... especially if theyre not asian
- some of you guys hype up ur idols too much... you should be able to criticize them when they do something thats not good... like produce a shitty song... or write shitty lyrics... 
- jongin is an overrated dancer. granted hes good but hes not that good
- kpop dance is really underwhelming. people  with 10 years in the industry cant even compare with the 15 year olds in those la workshops (bailey, kaycee, sean, shuri, etc...)

1691,2019-06-14,2019,6,14,16,c0h9yt,Buildups in a song that led to a completely different outcome from what's expected of it,tanookazam,1560497345,"It could be simple prechorus buildup or some other instrumental buildup as long as it leads to something far from what's expected of it. Like a lighthearted prechorus that leads to a pretty hard, banging chorus that makes you feel shocked.

Like: 

[Birthday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDJ4ct59NC4) by Somi. It has a fun prechorus that I totally expected to lead to a Twice-like chorus. What I got was naughty, fun, troublemaker (not the duo) vibe drop that I enjoyed immensely.^(Oops you're not invited, yeah, you're not invited oops)  

and of course who could forget [Love Cherry Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBbeuXW8Nko) if you're talking about hard drops. Lighthearted Katy Perry Teenage Dream vibes to Blackpink Boombayah vibes will forever be my favorite duo. 

Alternatively, there are songs with no hard drops at all, like [Remember Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrvdjyIL0fA) by Oh My Girl, but it's buildup made people expect one. (people were even wondering where the chorus was in the song)",31,31

1771,2019-06-14,2019,6,14,23,c0l1yy,190613 NCT 127 Coex Fansign,jolaurence,1560524186,"So, for those of you who have no idea who I am, hello. u/jolaurence is the name and I'm an American who works in Seoul as an English teacher and really, really likes NCT, especially Johnny. I haven't been as active on here for a lot of Personal Reasons (adulting is hard and your mental health is important so self care should be practiced whenever you can) but I got into a fansign. If you have not read any of my fan accounts, just click my name, find my submitted, and scroll through cause those will be important later on and also gives you a taste of who I am. 

I decided that going for a fansign would be a a great birthday gift to myself and it sure was. The fansign I got into was through SM and only 7 of the members would be present: Johnny, Doyoung, Yuta, Haechan, Taeil, Jungwoo, and Jaehyun. Taeyong and Mark were absent and as we know now Winwin is busy with WayV. Imagine my surprise that I got in. [I knew it was a sign when I kept getting Markyong as I opened my albums]

This was the very first weekday fansign that I actually got into. I've tried with Dream in the past and it never worked so I was pretty...ill prepared. I had to go from Teacher Mode to Fangirl Mode and let's just say that if this was a video game, I did not pass this level. I was a mess all around. First of all, I was the second person to go for the fansign. I normally have been towards the end and have had time to compose myself. This time...it was off to the races. Now I know for next time. Secondly, Johnny was the first person you talk to. Now, if you know my fan accounts and know my interactions, you know that I have been talking to Johnny for 2 years now. Yet every time I talk to him I turn into this ball of mush. If you have seen Her Private Life, I am Deokmi. She is the biggest GPOY ever for me. I knew I was doomed from the start. My brain literally shuts off after I talk to Johnny. But this time I had to force it not to because I had letters to give to Yuta, Jaehyun, and Haechan from a few friends of mine. So basically I had a mission and I could not mess it up. 

So, the boys arrive. They look good. My stress levels RISE. I am sitting in the second row and here they are in front of me. All Korean that I have studied in the past few months...gone. I knew I would be rushed and I wouldn't be able to stammer out any Korean. I knew I would be a mess trying to find my album pages. [I WAS SO RIGHT] So basically dear reader, I was a hot mess. I'm just going to say this now: even though I have lived in Korea for a long time, my speaking is still not good and I don't get much speaking practice because I HAVE TO talk to my kids in English. I'm also very shy when it comes speaking in another language and I am sure all of those who speak multiple languages understand that. 

I'll talk about my member interactions first and then go on to Johnny. After that, observations I had as I waited for 1.25 hours. I also need to mention that I wrote my name on my post it in Korean. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR LATER. I also want you all to know that staff rushes you at fansigns. You get 30 seconds max and that's it. You have to talk quick and fast otherwise...you wasted your time. 

The order of the fansign went like this: Johnny [end me now please], Yuta, Jaehyun, Jungwoo, Taeil, and Doyoung. 

After Johnny I went to Yuta and I had a letter to give him from my friend. I told him that it was her birthday that day and he wished her a happy birthday for me. After that I moved straight to Jaehyun. 

Now, Jaehyun is breathtaking up close. His visuals are outstanding. One of my really good friends who lives in England is Jaehyun biased and I had the great idea of having her write a letter to him. So here's our little conversation. 

**Jaehyun:** Hello there.

**Me:** Hi. Been a while. Sorry. Trying to find your page.

**Jaehyun:** It's okay. Take your time. 

**Me:** [melting inside over that] Okay. Found it. [I picked a different page than the one I wanted to be signed]

[Jaehyun signs the page] 

**Me:** This is a a letter from my friend [REDACTED]. She's from England and will be going to London. She's the Jae to my John.

**Jaehyun:** Okay.

**Staff:** Please move.

**Me:** Her birthday was when Ennana started. Thank you. Bye. 

After Mr. Jeong, was Haechan, my favorite evil child. I had to give him my friend's letter as well as tell him it was my birthday a few days ago. Also, his English has gotten a lot better. I was super flustered but I found his page, wished him a happy birthday, and then told him it was mine on Sunday. He wished me a happy birthday, I gave him my friend's letter, and then moved on to Jungwoo. 

I am very awkward around Jungwoo and it's because I haven't interacted with him as much as the others. He debuted last year and I met 127 a lot in 2017 before he was added into the group. He said hi to me and asked me where I was from. I then told him I was from America but live here in Korea and that he has met me before. He signed my page with a message and then we said our good byes.

Next was Mr. Moon aka almost birthday boy. He looked FINE. That was an A++++++ outfit. Very prep school chic. Taeil actually refused for us to sing him happy birthday at the fansign. He told us at the closing ment that his birthday is Friday so we must sing on Friday. Okay then good sir. We said hello and I wished him happy birthday and then told him mine was on Sunday. He then wished me a happy birthday and I told him that I had a friend who had a birthday on this day [Thursday] as well. We said thank you and good bye and I headed off to Doyoung.

Why couldn't Doyoung be first? He's a calming presence for me. Yet here he was last and I was already crashing and burning and wanted out of my life. He saw me and said hello and then I said ""see you again"" which is a tradition we have started since January 27, 2017. [He started it. I continued it.] I told him that his English is getting good and my Korean is getting better [my listening comprehension but he doesn't know that] and that I was proud of them. We said thank you, bye, and then he closed with a ""see you again."" 

And now we have Johnny. Okay picture this: you get into a fansign. Your UB, your ult, basically the person that you spend the most money on, usually is towards the middle or at the end and is rarely first. You get to the fansign and find out that you are going second. You then see them put out the new Superhuman water bottles and spy with your little eye John Suh's water bottle first. Do you a.) panic b.) scream inside or c.) all the above. You pick c. 

Remember when I said that reading my past fan accounts would help you? This is why. This entire conversation began 2 years ago and I had to bring it up again. 

**Johnny:** [shocked to even see me] Hello. Its been a while. 

**Me:** Yeah hi. [tries to find page] 228 days. Did you have to be first? Sorry I just came from work. You know. [finally hands him the album cause I almost forgot it]

**Johnny:** Why not? [he is talking about him being first by the way]

**Me:** Youre evil. Are you really a Hufflepuff?

**Johnny:** [looks at me as he starts to sign] Am I? [says this questioning it] 

**Me:** Okay. You told me and [REDACTED]...did you take Pottermore?

**Johnny:** I...yes.

[am about to tell him something else when suddenly]

**Johnny:** Wait a second. Is it two [letter in my name] or one?

[I look down to see that he is writing my name not in Korean like I have written down but in English FROM MEMORY]

**Me:** One.

**Johnny:** Just checking.

**Me:** Okay. Bye. See you soon I hope.

[Johnny just laughs as I walk away]


A brief summary for those confused, in February of 2017 I had a friend get into a fansign and because I was curious about his Hogwarts house, I had her ask him. He told her ""Gryffindor, duh"" with his whole chest. So in July 2017 I got him to say that he was a Gryffindor. He also told a friend back then that he was a Gryffindor. Fast forward to that event at Capitol Records in LA two weeks ago and he tells everyone he is a Hufflepuff. Of course I naturally went to the thing I know very well: Harry Potter. I went to LeakyCon and GeakyCon for a few years. I took a Harry Potter class in college. I LOVE HARRY POTTER. Yet here he is saying he is a Hufflepuff. Which house is it, Johnny? Which one is it?

After I finished with Johnny I was SHAKING. I always shake after I finish with Johnny and usually he is at the end so my shaking happens when I sit down but not today. As I was sitting after I finished my sign and waiting, I started to regret my entire conversation. Yes, it is a very on brand with my own personality as a conversation...but I panicked. It is what it is I guess. 

Like I have said before, the one thing I hate about fansigns is that it is so rushed. I was literally made to go so fast. So all of these conversations were short because they always rush the first ones because theyre like we got 100 of you to get through in 1.5 hours. The boys are also so tired. I wrote in my notes that you could see how tired they are. Yet Johnny was still smiling and laughing as it went on. The boys are like us, humans. They have their limits. And they have been working non stop for almost a year now. This is me being super worried over them. Theyre tired. Theyre exhausted. But they are still doing their job and love seeing us.

So, general observations: 
Lo and behold, I was by Taeil stans. This by the way is a super rare occurrence. So whenever he was free, we would all wave to him and he would wave back. Also I think I saw the legend in the flesh. Yes everyone. I might have seen carrot manager???? I kept being told to move a lot when I was going. I was the second to go so...I figured I would be rushed. Just...not to the point where my conversations with them seem like death. 

Haechan was cutely drinking his water bottle with the straw. We were dying and cooing. And then he gave us this look that he was doing it on purpose. A PUNK.There were lines for Jaehyun and Yuta as expected. Both members are super popular here in Asia. Jaehyun is literally all of Asia. Yuta is Japan and SEA. But Jaehyun...his power that he holds. When I say Korea is Jaehyun...I mean it.I actually made DIRECT EYE CONTACT with Haechan as I waited. He gave me a wave. I have been noticed by the Sun himself. 

Because I was there waiting for so long I made a Johnny fashion evaluation for Johnny. His skin looked as beautiful as ever. What he wore was A+++++++++. He is the most beautiful man to ever exist. And yes I saw the faint shadow of a moustache wanting to grow.At the end, Johnny was done and drinking water. He turned, saw me, I waved, and he waved back. [Let me die again] 

And then finally, I actually understood a lot of what they were saying at the end. Taeil kept telling us that his birthday is tomorrow so lets sing it tomorrow. Im not confident enough in translation but I could understand it.

They have been working so hard and what I want for them after the tour is not another comeback but REST. They need it. Their bodies are showing it. It will be worth the long wait to see them again. But I really did miss seeing my OT10. I miss them all together. 

So there's that. That's my fan sign experience for you all here, r/kpop. Thanks for reading something that is very long and not usually seen on this sub anymore. I'll try and answer comments but it's late. I'm tired. This took me over an hour to write. 

Happy Birthday Moon Taeil.

For instance in my defense even when I've posted something that may come of as bizarre there are times when I've gotten thousands likes (literally) so I think I'd leave it like that since it's one of the top comments. Examples: I made a low-key joke about JYP being a pervert in one video, it was video where he walks around flirting with younger girls so I posted: ""the Twice girls to their parents: hey do you want to see video of our boss?"".

He's the one that's the most likely to step up I think. PSY? If YG artists just transferred to P NATION, it would blow my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've only watched ""Kill it"" with Nana and liked it a lot, though I wish it was longer than 12 series + there are number of things I disliked such as how utterly evil the bad guy was (meaning they could've made him something less evil than child murderer). 

&amp;#x200B;

For now I am waiting for: Vagabond (Suzy, Miss a) and the next one with Nana which is going to be I'm afraid some very long and maybe boring legal drama. Also waiting for anything with Jisoo in it...

&amp;#x200B;

And if you care about male idols, I watched 2 series of ""He is psychometric"" a while ago, with one of the Got7 boys, it's very good though idk never had the time to watch all of the series.",9,0

Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release from the month listed in the title* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

Im not necessarily talking about copycats or clones, just groups where theres more than a slight similarity in style, presentation, image, etc.  

What got me thinking about this was getting more into (G)I-DLE shortly after EXID finished their Me&amp;You promotions and began their hiatus.  I see and hear a lot of similarities between (G)I-DLE and EXID.  Both have main rappers that are very involved in the musical composition and production for the group (and IMO Soyeon and LE have a very similar flow to their raps), theres a similarity in vocal texture with their singing (personally I think Yuqi has a very Solji-esque sound, Miyeon can sound quite a bit like Hyelin, Minnie like Hani, and Soojin like Jeongwha), and some of their tracks sound like they could easily have been written for either group (Whats In Your House, $$$, Blow Your Mind, and Give Me Your all stick out to me). 

Now, of course there are some major differences as well.  (G)I-DLE isnt as sexuality-forward as EXID, theyre tracks  dont have as much of the the dance/club groove that many EXID title tracks have, and theres the obvious lack of Shinsadong Tiger influence.  (G)I-DLE has their own unique sound, but they give me a similar feeling to listening to EXID and I can see them at least partially filling that particular void while EXID is on hiatus.  

What are some groups that youve felt have done something similar, and what are your thoughts on why that is?",70,36

Alongside your review, *please give the song a score between 1 and 10.* 1 being this song might not be something you love, and 10 being you will always love. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can also use the MV to inform your overall score  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

2002,2019-06-17,2019,6,17,11,c1hysr,Groups' songs as zodiac signs?,notmuchtotalkabout,1560737092,"Hey to my fellow astro hoes! 

I'm sure this is *not* a unique idea at this point, but I was just thinking about which of my ult group's songs (Monsta X) could be assigned to each zodiac sign. 

Of course no sign can be condensed to just its base traits, but I still think it's a fun concept, and it's a good way to introduce non-fans (or new fans!) to your favorite group. Mine all happen to be B-sides, so these tracks deserve more exposure. 

What songs from *your* favorite group would you pair with each zodiac sign? (Or just your sign... I don't mind.) Here are mine for Monsta X; tell me what you think! Links and explanations are below, blah blah :) 

* **Aries** \- *Rodeo* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWnUikWaQFU) 
   * This is a shameless, fun party anthem that gives me intense fire sign energy, and Aries is the only sign chaotic (and self-aware) enough to pull it off. It's not that deep, and that's how Aries would want it. 
* **Taurus** \- *Oh My!* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Ham/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkuzHkOrb0) 
   * Again, this song goes hard as hell, and it does *not* mince words. Tauruses are the bulls of the zodiac that run headfirst into everything, and this song is definitely honest in its intentions! 
* **Gemini** \- *Mohae* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xd2tR69_yw)
   * ""Mohae"" is the Korean equivalent of ""wyd"" and Geminis would hit you with that text at 2 am, either as a booty call or to do some spontaneous shit. (And yes, the ""no fake fake fake fake"" part was @ y'all who think Geminis are two-faced. Sorry they're cooler than you.) 
* **Cancer** \- *Underwater* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYaXcfJzjSw) 
   * Is this water metaphor too on the nose? Yeah? ...Sorry. For real though, I've never known a Cancer who was not melodramatic as all hell, and they're in their feelings 24/7. RIP. 
* **Leo** \- *Tropical Night* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy2GreDBBVs) \+ [Self-cam MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRpnMoDLgNc)
   * Full disclosure, I'm a Leo. (Duh, only a Leo would make this post.) This song is brimming with ego, but it's firmly tongue-in-cheek. It's hella fun at parties. *All eyes on me*\~ 
* **Virgo** \- *Perfect Girl* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki_84bn84Ss) \+ [Self-cam MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrfWMqwRSlY) 
   * Virgos are fixated on this idea of perfection. They're idealists, but pragmatic at the same time. They're also corny af, and would totally bust out this song to serenade you outside your window... Love them. 
* **Libra** \- *Lost in the Dream* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uhXu3YvEE0) 
   * Libras are the daydreamers of the zodiac! Even though they're an air sign, they wear their hearts on their sleeve. If the signs were an idol group, Libra would be the ""4D personality."" 
* **Scorpio** \- *Fallin'* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlU2uxAzJbo) 
   * If this song *doesn't* get you lit, you're lying to yourself. (It's also horny.) There's a lot of contrasting fire/water imagery in this song - Scorpio has this duality, and many people think it's a fire sign at first because of its passion and intensity. 
* **Sagittarius** \- *Oi* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg30D_sg4IQ) 
   * Sags are adventurers, always moving forward and blazing new trails. They are *not* afraid of jumping into life headfirst, and that's the vibe this song gives me - independent and flashy. 
* **Capricorn** \- *From Zero* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFl8xaY5gBY) 
   * Choosing for Cap was harder than I anticipated! I settled on this song (written by MX's own Wonho) because it's an acknowledgement that things end, feelings change, and we can't change the past. Caps are pragmatists who would describe lost love in these terms - a numeric value set to zero. 
* **Aquarius** \- *Myself* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNLy42cjwv4) \+ [Comeback stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KX0TKIvHgA) (!)
   * This is the most unique MX song I know, and one of the most unique K-pop songs I've ever heard. Similarly, Aquas are unusual and proud of it; it's hard to put them in a box. They have rich inner worlds (or ""B-sides"") that others know nothing about. 
* **Pisces** \- *If Only* 
   * [Audio + Lyrics (Han/Rom/Eng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQIHsREuJjo) \+ [Holiday Special MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfEPinYMsI8) 
   * Another Wonho song, which is only fitting as he *is* a Pisces! This song overflows with unspoken longing, tenderness, and all that soft shit we know (and love) water signs for. It's love that will endure into the future. 

So what did you think? Is your sign accurate or not? Please let me know and leave your own songs in the comments!

2031,2019-06-17,2019,6,17,16,c1kmro,Why is kpop appealing to you? How does kpop (and its fandom) differ from Western music?,thehanghoul,1560756220,"Im interested in why people enjoy kpop. People ask me often why Im interested in it, compared to western music (which I also enjoy). I used to not really know why, as it seemed so addicting. However, I basically found that my reasons for my
Kpop fandom are basically these:

1. Songs are catchy, and also for the most part pretty light (I.e. fun songs, not overly political, songs to just mindlessly enjoy). 

American songs can be light, but also reflect lots of political undertones and feelings during the time they were written. 

2. Dancing is extremely crisp and high quality. Also music video production value is extremely high. Easy to find resources to popular dances. 

Very rarely do you see artists in the West with great dancing moves, and great music videos to follow. 

3. Fandom feels more involved. At least for groups, I feel that the group members work so hard, and sacrifice so much for their dreams, but also for their fans. Perhaps fans go too far, and there groups might be forced to act a certain way, but it is very refreshing to see groups pouring so much to their fans (at least thats what it seems like). 

In contrast, while there are some good fan clubs, they seem more casual. It feels like musicians here play music for themselves rather than for others (or, they write songs for themselves, and hope that other people can relate or feel the same way for their songs). 



4. The kpop community. It seems more collective to support kpop groups than even western bands. I love how involved the fans are. Translating, transcribing, and dance practice groups are amazing in their dedication to their groups and artists. 

Again, while there are some popular fan groups, it seems casual. Where have you seen so much dedication to a group or artist in western music? 


Just my thoughts. Please feel free agree or disagree,  add your own thoughts, or critique or add to my ideas presented. This is in ways meant to bash western music, but rather to see how it compares.",13,0

Her outfit was a bit awkward, so many people commented on how she needs a new stylist and better outfits. After reading so many, I went to Pinterest and set up a folder of single pieces to make up outfits that fit the vibe and aesthetic of the song. It was actually a lot of fun. It got me thinking. What if I made like an IG or Twitter account dedicated to outfits that I think would fit the vibe/aesthetic of an idol, music video, song, group, etc. Just something fun since putting together kpop-inspired outfits has proven to be entertaining. That and who knows? I might just get acknowledged as a stylist one day ",1,2

&amp;#x200B;

people argue that lisa isnt actually that good but my friend says that its just because her group is made up of 4 members and thats why her choreorgraohy cant really come through as there is not much you can do with the limited amount f positions, similarly this is why she argues why momo isnt as good because she thinks everything looks better with the 9 people groups and all the formations, canons and other dance techniques that can be implemented

&amp;#x200B;

she also says that lisa is much better compared to her other members so therefore she has to do less advanced stuff to accomodate

&amp;#x200B;

my other friend says that Seulgi is the best because even in songs like  Be Natural and Automatic which are slower she still dances well.

&amp;#x200B;

another reason towards lisa is that she can supposedly just learn songs by 'looking at them' as seen by the video of her learning what is love and red flavour after a single watch

&amp;#x200B;

in twices likey and a few other songs momo also gets center dance break

&amp;#x200B;

so which of my friends is right??",1,0

Seeing her last performances I expected her to be good since she blended well with a group and had an amazing stage presence. However, seeing her debut esp her live performances, I admit that her songs are catchy and a very good choice for a debut but she looked worried and unhappy during stage performances that I started to feel that way too while watching her videos. I kind of felt underwhelmed with her performances but Im still hoping for better live performances!! She doesnt have to worry about anything since shes really pretty and talented, I still love her voice and even think she improved over time but she has to work with her stage presence and the energy she wants to share to others during her performances.

I get that some are just crack tweets, but the more you venture through it, some just get realer. I'm a het woman and I exclusively stan girl groups because I lean towards their music more, they're relatable, mv-wise: aesthetics are stunning, their style is always on-point they inspire me to try out new looks. I have nothing against the lgbt+ community, they deserve to live happily, and I get the fact that they go through a lot to be generally accepted.

I've been out of stan twt for 6 months now. The hate tweets triggered my depression more and I felt like I should hide my sexuality so as to not receive hate. Been a stan for 9 years now, and some years back, stan community was very much accepting, less fanwars and was all about enjoying their group's music.

Why is their older music available for purchase but not the new stuff?  Can someone explain this to me?

Then you've got SOMI's Birthday that IS available for purchase, so whatever it is, it's not affecting everything.

Compared to GFriend's current music style, it has a different new vibe where Drop and lively Moombahton rhythms were exquisitely accented by Pop colors. This is them announcing a new beginning without them losing their own colors.

**""Mr. Blue""** is a remarkable song which made changes to New Jack Swing rhythm by adding refreshing strings sounds with tropical vibe. It wants to break the stereotype of 'Love is Red' by comparing one's love to the blue sea.

**""Smile""**: Through the impressive song's confident and straightforward lyrics, you can feel GFriend's other charms which match well with changes of various parts and cool sounding synthesizers.

**""Wish""**: Contains what GFriend want to have in 'love' as they grow from teenagers to adults. It is a song that shows sophisticated beat and addictive synth lines.

**""Paradise""**: A song of Funky Pop genre based on the composition of the acoustic band instruments and the suitable combination of Synth. Moreover, the vocals of a more mature GFriend, rhythmical and urban melodies forming a new harmony. Always dreaming of a perfect life, but also sends a message that you are always there for real happiness.

**""Hope""**: All the members of GFriend wrote songs for the first time in their lyrics, and their heartfelt enthusiasm for the fans, 'Buddy', plus funny rhythms of the New Jack Swing genre and the retro musical instruments.

**""Flower (Korean Ver.)""**: The intensity reminiscence of the 30-member full orchestra sound and the Spanish matador impresses, expressing the flower's heart that blooms and loses in the same spot ot meet the presence of ""you"" even if the cold wind blows.

If you are a BLINK (BlackPink fan) you would OBVIOUSLY support your faves which are : BlackPink, you would also think that the girls are so talented and have amazing stage presence!!
But other fandoms might think otherwise.. (keyword : MIGHT) why, you may ask?
Well this might be a bit old but I wanted to know your opinions on BlackPink and if they deserve the love and attention they get or are they just well known for their songs-nothing interesting..

As you all in the KPOP subreddit may know, BlackPink is under YG Ent. Which actually the CEO, Yang Hyun-Suk, has stepped down from his position because of a recent scandal between another YG Artist (who was also very well known)...But does this mean BlackPink, IKON, and other artists are over?! We will find out..

There has been a stir a while ago with Jennie being lazy on stage and people supported this statement with evidence from performances that BlackPink did. A majority of people were pissed that they paid money for tickets to see BlackPink, only for Jennie to dance lazily and not be enthusiastic as other members. Now there were multiple reasons being said by multiple people that included stuff like: 
She was tired from -
Obviously YG favours her more -l
Just stop hating on Jennie she did well
Now I dont know what you think but I think that Jennie is obviously one of the more favoured people in YG and it shows... 
Theres also occasions where Jennies outfits were better than the rest of members, like she got the best stylists (which I find this topic really unnecessary to make drama about).

This was a really short post but please tell me some more topics I could write about and discuss with you all, as Im very bored at home () 

Please state your opinion about BlackPink :)",1,0

I would say BTS is my ult, but I also listen to a lot of other groups (mostly GGs) music.

Anyway, while I was watching last Sundays episode of TRoS this morning (in which Kwanghee was a guest), I remembered reading somewhere that he was (still is?) an idol so I thought Id look him up and, not only did I found out that hes a member of ZEA, he and Hyungsik (whom I only know from dramas) were/are bandmates.

For me I kinda enjoyed G-Idle's music but their appropriation of Indian culture, and how they had a performance where they were dancing in front of the image of a mosque to show the ""Indian"" concept was a big yikes, and I could not support them afterwards",39,0

Regardless of how you think about her voice, you can't say there's anyone else who sounds like her when she sings. 

Mina (Gugudan): It's pretty tiring to me that Gugudan is constantly referred to as Sejeong &amp; Friends. Yes, Sejeong is an amazing singer but we all know that Sejeong is more popular because of I.O.I. and Mina is just as good a singer as Sejeong. Whenever Mina gets to branch out and do a ballad, she kills it. 

Solar (Mamamoo): In the past, Solar was definitely more popular but it seems like Wheein and Hwasa are beginning to get more attention from her and a lot of that has to do with choices. Both Wheein and Hwasa were smarter in the solo stuff they get to do, they've gone for a more current sound, whereas Solar's songs have been slow, acoustic-type ballads which don't really show how good a singer she is. If you sing like Solar, you shouldn't be singing the type of songs Baek Yerin does (and I love Baek Yerin).",16,0

And then make threads like 'How long will you listen to a song you don't like from your ults?', it's a little bizarre and also happens a little too frequently. Correct me if I am wrong.

2. Hating anything YG

People shit on YG the person so much, I am one of those people, but that hatred bleeds into hatred for their artists as well in so many threads. Its like if you want upvotes criticise a YG artist or YG.",236,126

Hello everyone! Im here with the results of the fourth round of TBSW, and with the results of the third round, respectively. Were gonna start with the results for each matchup (and my ironic, subjective commentary, please dont take it seriously, its just a joke), then well have the three highest voted songs from this round and the three lowest voted. Afterwards, pretty much the same system will be followed with the results for Round Three. Round Five will have its separate post. Here we go!

&amp;#x200B;

**Round Four Breakdown**

In this round, 199 responses have been recorded. Some of the matchups had ridiculous differences between the respective songs (as in, literally only one vote), while some other matchups had huge differences between the songs (60+ votes).

2549,2019-06-21,2019,6,21,0,c2xllh,Things in Kpop you feel others (who aren't kpop fans or fans of only one group) are genuinely missing out on,tanookazam,1561045436,"It's not like the ""OMG You NEED Kpop in your LIFE!"" kind of missing out but more of, ""if you only gave this a chance you might like it."" People could be content with whatever they like but I feel like some people are completely missing out on something they could be enjoying (with mental health issues roaming about, I honestly think that Kpop could help some people cope with their condition by enjoying good kpop content)

Like me for example, I never appreciated or acknowledged rap before because of the usual raps about sex and drugs and other nasty stuff. Combine that with swear words blaring in your ears and it's just an uncomfortable experience for me. Yes, some raps are used for inspiring others and such, but me being unappreciative of any rapping because of that stigma I placed on it ended when I listened to more kpop. If I didn't fall down the kpop hole I wouldn't learn to appreciate rapping techniques and flow and technical stuff like that, and I wouldn't learn to support those rappers who are actually using their skills for good, instead of me just going ""all rap is bad."" 

I  feel like people are also missing out on genuinely good music. The kpop genre offers so much variety it's hard to not please anyone. (And it also helped me find genres I never thought I would enjoy)

Feel free to put minor/humorous things too, I *genuinely* think that people are missing out on a bunch of laughable and cute moments that could brighten their day :)",45,55

1)  Onewe - Ring on my ears
2) Eric Nam - Lose you 
3) JJ Project - Coming Home

6) SHAUN - Nocturnal
7) Highlight - Leave Me Alone
8) Motte - Dont Run Away
9) CN BLUE - Blind Love
10) Taeyeon, Verbal Jint - I

Underrated doesnt mean we never heard of the songs or even the artist but rather means that we sometimes forgot these amazing songs existed.

Is black people wearing hanbok or yukata cultural appropriation? Have you asked Koreans or Japanese people that? 
Is white people wearing idk Typical Chilean clothing (my country) appropriation? Because I can tell you that in our perspective it isnt.

My point is, not everyone thinks the same way, the environment you are in influence what you think, doesnt mean those people are trying to insult your culture, they probably dont have any bad intention, so calling them things over things like that or canceling them is completely uncalled, otherwise we are all cancelled, yes including the ones who cancel people.

2603,2019-06-21,2019,6,21,11,c34p76,In three days I could see this:,JebusdeMazaret,1561082785,"1. The community. Little girls have taken over this genre, you go to twitter and read every barbarity, they comment on everyone, they match everyone, they argue for nonsense, they hate people and companies they do not know, they believe all the shit they see on internet, etc.
2. The community is more concerned with the appearance than the music, the clothes they wear, whether it is brand or not, how much it costs, a moment, this was not a musical genre?, where is the music?
3. The hatred, everyone hates everyone, I read that an idol got married and only because they got married the fans do not want it in the group and they demand the group not to reinstate it and to finally expel it, I ask, who are they to ask for this?
4. The singers have no private life, I read a bit about this recent case of a singer from a company called YG Entertainment, a medium published private conversations of this singer with a young lady asking for drugs, I can understand if this fact were public, but it is a private conversation that does not concern anyone but them, if the boy wanted to do drugs and asks his friend for a message that is supposed to be private, what is the problem? is his life, why does it affect what he does with his private life?
5. Companies are better known than the artists themselves, this is surreal.
6. The artists are under the orders of the fans, they can not drink, they can not smoke, they can not go out with friends, they can not be in love, they can not express themselves or say what they feel, because everything is judging, everything seems wrong, you can not say that a singer is a little bad, because they all come to attack you as if you were insulting their parents, and their attacks are not substantiated, they are full of hatred.
7. The appearance, very important point, because the only thing I've seen is that the appearance is highly valued and if you're not pretty or you do not have a good voice, then you will not succeed, and if you're pretty and do not sing anything, it does not matter, you're pretty , that sells. This is the most superficial community I have seen in my life, nobody appreciates anything if it is not beautiful, very sad.
8. Most of the songs I've heard are bad, they talk about fruits, sweets, etc., I do not say that they are all bad, but the ones I've heard, the bad ones have more visits and the good few visits, coincidentally in the good songs there are not so pretty people, and in the bad ones there are.
9. I have seen a group where there is a member who does not sing, I do not understand this, it is music, I do not care if he/she dances well or badly, I want to hear his/her voice, I can not see his/her dance on Spotify.
10. In almost all the videos I've seen, always focuses on the most beautiful of the group, others go to the background, do not matter much.
11. **Finally to emphasize my opinion, everything is criticized, everything is wrong, hatred is normal, you are beautiful or nothing.**",4,0

I mean 2009 has to be the most iconic year musically for K-pop. Just a rundown...

Group Debuts-If 2018 was a bloodbath for girl groups the 2009 was freaking World War III

* Girl Groups (I mean this roster is stacked, let's give it up for the girls)

1. 2NE1-Fire
2. 4minute-Hot Issue
3. Afterschool-AH!
4. f(x)-La Cha Ta
5. Rainbow-Gossip Girl
6. Secret-I Want You Back
7. T-ara-Lie

* Boys Groups

1. Beast-Bad Girl
2. MBLAQ-Oh Yeah

&amp;#x200B;

Songs (It's crazy how so many iconic songs came out in one year) (SM was killing it!)

1. Girls Generation-Gee, Genie
2. Kara-Mister
3. SUJU-Sorry Sorry
4. 2PM-Again &amp; Again, Heartbeat
5. Shinee-Juliette, Ring Ding Dong
6. Brown Eyed Girls-Abracadabra
7. G-Dragon-Heartbreaker

&amp;#x200B;

I love how SM create them with one of the best visual: Irene, the best vocalist: Wendy, the best all-round: Seulgi. And their discography is amazing with limitless concept. But the problem is I can't watch their live performances without cringe, like  [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkt9Qn14Klk) . Synchronization plays huge role in Kpop but they always mess it up. Yeri is left out because she did all the move wrong. And others have different angles of movement and dance styles. It's not because they have less members because I enjoy Mamamoo and ITZY stages a lot.

NCT is great, one of my favourite boy groups because their music (same as Red Velvet, it's just SM thing) and their talents, they're not lack of anything. But as much as I love Taeyong, I still think he over-shadow others too much. That's not his fault to be too perfect, I know. Taeyong as NCT center is even more ""center"" than Produce series. But I feel pity for others who are also talented and Taeyong who is exhausted being main everything.",22,0

Momoland- Freeze! , Red Velvet- Zimzalabim // Carnival Concept


Gfriend // Elegant and sweet


Blackpink // girl crush. I wasn't into girl crush until I got into them.


LOONA- Butterfly , CLC- Me , CLC- No // Empowerment. It's really refreshing to see self love instead of romance all the time you know?

Hard to explain lol,thetadelta987,1561149034,"So kind of hard to explain but for me, in kpop specifically, I always hate the actual songs in music videos idk why, but then the second the comeback stage or live performance surfaces I fall in love with the song. I guess I just have a thing for the dances and performances. For example, at first I hated the song Idol when the music video dropped, I was watching it with my friends and they were all raving like wow the songs amazing, the dance is crazy but for some reason it just didnt click with me. Then once I saw the fancam of them performing the song on tour and heard the song on Spotify without the music video I fell in love with the song.  
This is sort of a softer case for me, but Red Velvet RBB, when the music video dropped I was like wtf this is crowded and just didnt make sense. But once their cb stage was shown I loved the song 

So I ask, what is your kpop thing? For me its that I hate the songs in music videos but I love them in performances.",131,88

For me, I would pick TWICE's Fancy. I chose this because it shows that:


1. Women are now showing more ""boyish"" features, and are more badass. (And by boyish, I mean wearing pants/shorts, less feminine makeup, and shorter hair


2. The song itself is a prime example of modern music because with a bit of Electronica and  dance-y feel to it. 


3. Has more energy than most songs for that time. (Or at least what I imagine anyways)


4. It's quicker and more fast paced. It just shows on how fast life in the modern world is. (Unrelated, but it's found that Gen Z has evolved to have some sort of ""ADHD"" compared to older generations. Sorry can't find the article, but I'm sure you can find it somewhere)",5,4

First, I miss the discovery. Granted I still discover new things and new groups, but theirs something about discovering your first few groups and the ideas and concepts that Kpop has that is different when you arent exposed to them already. 

Secondly, I miss the innocence of my early Kpop days when I just enjoyed the music and the groups. I didnt know about all the problems, scandals, behind the scenes drama, etc. It was just me watching some cool music videos and discovering another world. 

Now as a disclaimer, I wouldnt go back to those days cause I like how much I know about the industry and how much Im involved in the community now.",183,319

Like here in America we had Kelly Clarkson win the first season of American Idol and then after that the rest of the winners werent nearly as successful (well I guess Carrie Underwood?). Oh and you guys over in the UK had Leona Lewis (goddess). Dont even get me started on The Voice. But my point is, after the beginning these shows stopped putting out stars.

2839,2019-06-22,2019,6,22,17,c3nh4i,I think BTS paved the way for K-Pop music in America but PSY gave them the tool to do it with.,NiGhTmArEofInSaNiTy,1561193988,"Think of the wave of K-Pop popularity in America as a road, and the only way to travel is by car, only the car is powered by influence. Psy had a fair bit of influence :

- He was essentially the first korean act that became popular
- He was the first and still is the only korean act with a top 5 hit, and he has 2
- Only korean act with a top 3 hit
- Gangnam Style is certified 5 times platinum and is still only K-pop song to get beyond a platinum certification
- Gangnam Style and Gentleman are the only 2 K-POP songs with over 1 billion views on youtube

But he only had enough influence for maybe a couple of miles, most of it used to accidentally make K-Pop seem like a joke to the public, ultimately resulting in it disappearing from America for a few years. He knew he couldn't turn back and leave the car there so for a while he just waited, waited for more influence, fuel for the car. Then, around 2015, a new group emerged, a group known as BTS, and Psy saw that they had plenty of fuel in them and so much more to gain, fuel he no longer had the ability to gain, the little influence he no longer had just gone forever. BTS has plenty of influence within them and because of this influence, they were given the keys to the car by Psy, revved up the engine and zoomed away to travel the road all the way to making K-Pop mainstream in America.",1,0

My favourite examples of idol groups admitting this are when Monsta X confessed that I.M plays video games while naked, and when Bona just straight up said that WJSN runs around the dorm naked, while the others are just trying to stop her from exposing them.

What are some other funny examples of this happening?",121,201

2876,2019-06-23,2019,6,23,2,c3sgkq,Who is the tallest and shortest idol and were you ever surprised by an idol's height?,just_give_me_noodles,1561224804,"First of all, I'm sorry for not using American metrics below (but it's hot and i'm just lazy to convert anything to american...) 

so just trust me when I tell you that something is ""short"" or ""tall"" lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I made some googling to get an idea:

&amp;#x200B;

RM, BTS: 181 cm (normally tall, above average worldwide)

T.O.P, Bigbang: 182 cm (this is in fact 2 cm over Myke Tyson...tallest?) 

GD: 177 (average in America?)

&amp;#x200B;

Since I care more about the girl groups though: 

&amp;#x200B;

Jeon Soyeon: 157 cm (that's very short, I'm not very surprised but sort of thought she may be above 160, so maybe since she is still very young she can grow another 2-3 cm?)

&amp;#x200B;

Tzuyu: 172 cm, this is quite model material. To give you perspective: Sara Sampayo, Victoria secret's model is the same height. Above 170 for women is already a model height. I was surprised actually, never thought she is that tall..

Nana: one of my top biases is 171 cm, I kind of suspected it...

&amp;#x200B;

In short: Blackpiank seem on the shorter side as 2Ne1 though Lisa is 1.67 so just average I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Who am I missing?",193,48

Upon investigating further, I've learned that [they've been using the line during their live performances.](https://youtu.be/nXw4LdS0rTM?t=147). I dove even further and found out that [BTS used the N word during their cover performance of the song.](https://youtu.be/MHP6d-nGA14?t=122)

Im writing this in pure rage, as because I lost my best friend to kpop. She got into that kpop stuff a couple months back. She started acting all weird and stalking them and stuff, like every typical boy band girl fan. 

Things escalated when I pre-ordered the new call of duty. She started repeating all over how thats 2 EXO merchs and started repeating all that my game was a waste of money.

Soon enough i flipped out, telling her how cringe she and her friends were. How they stalk them like they have nothin better to do, that the waste of money was their merch, with some random plastic card of their idols and Im a lot better of buying fortnite skins than buying this shit, and got home. 

When i got home, i opened my instagram and saw that she unfollowed me and deleted all of our highlights togeder. 

Dont get me wrong, i have no problem with kpop . Its just that the fans get real cringe sometimes.

The rules are pretty much explained in the form, you can vote THREE times at most and voting will last FIVE days. Please respect that.

3136,2019-06-25,2019,6,25,0,c4qdbd,Im noticing a trend...,wendyunniestan,1561391987,"Ive been on this sub for over a year and I would say my experience is usually positive, but 2019 has been super painful with fandoms, especially on this subreddit. My discrepancy is that people are taking notes from stan twitter and spreading hate and negative comments all around the sub based on whatever song is out that they hate. 

I first noticed this when BlackPinks KTL came out not everyone loved it, thats fine, I get it, I didnt love it either when it first came out. Yet everyone seemed to instantly start hating on BP and I guess its the YG bandwagon hate coming through (disclaimer: I do not support YG). It seemed like anyone who enjoyed KTL was drowned out by downvotes and comments saying how could you like it when its trash. 

Fast forward some time and Zimzalabim comes out. This sub is home to a lot of reveluvs so I anticipated reactions to be polar just because its more experimental than RBB. What I keep noticing is that the ones who like zzb seem to be the minority on this sub and the red velvet subs. The problem? Well the problem is that when anything about red velvet gets posted, people feel the need to project how much they dont like zzb. I dont care if you dont like zzb, but stop downvoting people who enjoy the song. We all have different taste and we all are different people. Let the people who enjoy the comeback enjoy it! 

Also people take the zzb negativity and spin it out on red velvets whole discography. This may be a hard pill for bad boy stans to swallow, but red velvet has two sides: red and velvet, if the only album you ever listened to is the perfect red velvet then thats fine, but dont go commenting: How could anyone like zzb? Its trash. Joy is a an SM robot. Lee Sooman is a dumb***. I even see people that like zzb saying if you want to listen to basic music go stream red flavor; youre part of the problem too!

This sub doesnt need the great zimzalabim schism. Just in the future, please respect those who like music even if you dont like it. Its hurtful when people say you have to be brainwashed to like a certain song or group, just let people enjoy the comeback period. If you dont like a song you can say that but it isnt your job to downvote everyone who likes it and vice versa. 

This problem goes beyond RV and BP and as k-pop fans we should strive to keep this sub a safe place to discuss our opinions.  Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me?",6,4

3141,2019-06-25,2019,6,25,2,c4s4to,What are your thoughts on fandom divisions and solo/unit/song/concept stans?,caralyn7,1561397989,"I commented stuff on this earlier on someone else's post that got taken down, but I'd figured I'd make my own post because I have a lot of thoughts on this.

Basically, while fandom divisions have always existed to a certain extent, I feel like the factionism has never been more apparent than recently. The fighting within fandoms is getting really annoying and toxic these days and it's not just on stan Twitter, either. You've got akgae solo stans who love one member while constantly hating on the others (apparently this is a big issue among Blinks, particularly with the whole Lisa VS Jennie fan drama). Red Velvet has a ton of division these days with Bad Boy/Red Flavor stans complaining about their more experimental and risky tracks, but on the other hand the experimental fans who call Bad Boy/Red Flavor stans ""basic"", ""bandwagon stans"" or whatever are just as bad. Then you've got people who only like a certain era of a group's music - ""old"" VS ""new"" music fans (think BTS and Mamamoo). 

I'm gonna talk about this one the most because it's with the group I follow the most closely: NCT unit stans are fucking unbearable. Given the NCT system, there was always going to be some competition or comparison between units, but it's gotten exponentially worse as of late. You've got people claiming WayV isn't a part of the group, a ton of Dream and WayV stans hating 127 for SM favoritism, 127 supremacists bragging about their achievements and saying they're better than the other units...the list goes on, really. And I'm honestly so sick of it because the point of NCT is that each unit has something different to offer; you can totally prefer one unit over another and that's fine, but what's the point of bringing down other units to justify your favoritism? I agree that SM's implementation of the limitless units concept hasn't been perfect by any means, but there's no need for such hate and finger-pointing between units. And let me just point out that most of these Dream and WayV stans who hate on 127 didn't start popping up until 127 got more famous, which is classic because people like to be hipsters and hate on whatever's popular, we get it. I'm gonna go out on a limb and bet half of those people who go around saying ""Dream is the superior unit!!!"" only do so because they don't want to seem ""basic"" by liking 127 and don't actually show any effort in supporting Dream, but whatever.

My point is, I don't mind if fans prefer a certain member/unit/song/concept. We're all entitled to our own opinions as long as they are constructive and mature, but so many people these days are oversensitive and can't handle differences in opinion. As a fan, you don't have to like every single member, unit, song, or concept a group does -- you just can't *hate* or bring down anything because of it (and if you can actually find it within yourself to hate someone you don't know and who hasn't done anything bad, then you need to get a life). I feel like anyone who expresses a negative, yet fair and constructive opinion on anything automatically gets witch hunted, which just adds to the toxicity of fandoms overall.

So what are your opinions on fandom divisions and solo/unit/song/concept stans? What other examples have you noticed within fandoms?",130,100

Red Velvet- Zimzalabim // Do I even NEED to talk about this? To me, this was a mix of both r/ATBGE and r/GTBAE .


BTS- Fake Love // before ARMYs come and attack me, I wanna say that I *don't* hate BTS. Just the song was  a great taste, but it kinda sounded like they where""complaining""/whining in their voices. I think it could have been executed better.


Twice- Yes or Yes // honestly, the girls made a catchy and up-beat song, but the styling was just.. horrendous. I can only imagine they where trying to do a girl crush sort of thing, but it kinda fell flat.


Twice- Fancy // I adore everything about the comeback, but the stylinng on some stages the styling was pretty underwhelming


AOA- Excuse Me // to me, their detective/spy concept was a classic case of r/ATBGE . (One of my favorite kpop songs and dance if all time!) 


Orange Carmel // to me all of their songs and concepts where just.. just .. had me SHOOK. Just had me shook on how they can pull of such odd concepts",40,2

3173,2019-06-25,2019,6,25,11,c51b0i,"Future of Kpop, moving away from idols?",HanyaYM,1561431567,"Had a thought recently: the word ""idol"" and the concept of ""idol"" in East Asia has always carried the meaning of ""role model."" So since its inception, the job description of an idol, and a more ""traditional"" understanding of idol culture, has always involved performers serving as positive role models and inspirations/sources of positive energy for their largely young, school-aged target audience. Obviously, idol culture has since then evolved and each market/country has its own set of norms for their ""idols,"" with various subgenera/subcultures mixed within.  

I think the ""Western"" market, with its need for individuality and authentic self-expression, just cannot fathom the idea of idols. I feel like we are a bit too cynical to ever embrace or even understand the appeal of idols. For the vast majority, it will always feel forced, manufactured, inauthentic, too clean, and too polished. 

I bring this up 1. to explain partially why drug use and/or dating scandals can still be big controversies when you keep traditional idol expectations in mind. Not just because Korea is socially conservative (I'm not qualified at all to be making such assessments), but bc these sorts of scandals mean this artist is deliberately violating their job description as ""idols"" in the traditional sense. Like a doctor deliberately harming their patients. Hence the outrage and sense of betrayal for some fans. The drug use is obvious: as a role model to kids/minors, u shouldn't be doing drugs or drinking or smoking. The justification for the dating bit is a bit more shaky: as a role model to kids, u shouldn't be dating bc kids should be focusing on their studies and not dating. AND/OR dating while being an idol is seen as... not being committed to your job 100% - which is what u should be showing to the kids as their role model: 100% commitment. Which, alrighty, sure.

2. I think the current generation of Kpop artists also want to move away from this idol label to be able to more authentically grow as artists. Also, marketability wise, pop stars are far more acceptable in the ""West"" than idols. 

The English-speaking/ ""Western"" market seems really cynical about this idea of celebrities serving as role models. The closest thing to ""idols"" I can think of are maybe the Disney Channel/Nickelodeon stars that have become pop singers over the years. The narrative has always been big corporations getting these kids to sign restrictive contracts that limit their personal freedoms and individual expression. With the result being that once their contracts are up, all of these former child stars do everything in their power to leave their squeaky clean image behind, in part to assert their freedom and individuality.  It's an interesting sort of parallel with some Kpop artists. 

However, I grew up with idols and they continue to make this existence on earth somewhat bearable. Hell, some of my favorite people pride themselves on being idols, so I hope Kpop can just expand and diversify without needing to appeal to any particular market or trend. Let's hope we all get to keep what we love and see the things we hate reformed. So, do you think idol culture still has a place in Kpop? Are you cynical? Are you idealistic? 

TLDR: Do you think increasing global exposure and expansion of Kpop will ultimately lead to the industry outgrowing the ""idol"" (positive role model, squeaky clean image) business model and adopt a more ""Western"" pop star business model (iconic branding of individual self/emphasis on authentic self-expression/more liberal acceptance of drug use/public relationships/scandals/mistakes etc.)?",25,0

I posted it on my account that I didnt like how a white person was debuting under K-pop simply because, I feel like K-pop is meant for us Asians. All Asian ethnicities btw, not just Koreans. 

After I posted it on my story, someone replied basically saying, if thats the case then should we kick Asian actors out of Hollywood? and after I told that person that Hollywood isnt inclusive to whites people, the person said I sound like how the Japanese were saying Asia for Asians during WW2 and that theres no manual saying Kpop is only for Asians hahaha.

3206,2019-06-25,2019,6,25,17,c55ct6,What are some mini albums that aren't talked about enough?,lalaliana8,1561452564,"Earlier today, I was going through my k-pop playlist when I stumbled upon a few mini albums that I just can't fault and wish more people talked about. So, I made this thread to share some of my personal favourite underrated mini albums, and to hopefully find some new ones to add to my playlist.

Here are my personal favourites.

1. \[**THE STORY BEGINS - TWICE**\]([https://open.spotify.com/album/3EaCSjHsgMGMbvC1xFCXUD](https://open.spotify.com/album/3EaCSjHsgMGMbvC1xFCXUD)): While this definitely isn't Twice's best album, I believe it's one of their best ones. I love every song, and I love how they included songs they performed on SIXTEEN. My personal favourite song would have to be \[Truth\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/4L8ZMG7GMJbKKA40IUDdvH](https://open.spotify.com/track/4L8ZMG7GMJbKKA40IUDdvH)).
2. \[**ROOKIE - RED VELVET**\]([https://open.spotify.com/album/5Bg49LEfyoZzKpQsEwRCtI](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Bg49LEfyoZzKpQsEwRCtI)): This is one of Red Velvet's best mini albums IMO. You've got bright and colourful songs like \[Happily Ever After\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/7H1ly0lZJ9ebnci5B9t7Nh](https://open.spotify.com/track/7H1ly0lZJ9ebnci5B9t7Nh)) that compliment the title track mixed in with magical slow songs like \[Little Little\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/1IAEhCKD6ZSjnDdeJgvXWA](https://open.spotify.com/track/1IAEhCKD6ZSjnDdeJgvXWA)). But undoubtedly, the best song on this mini is \[Body Talk\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/3CihjB4pu58o2ititZw9Yg](https://open.spotify.com/track/3CihjB4pu58o2ititZw9Yg)). It's a song I can listen to no matter what mood I'm in, and it's just got so much power to it.
3. \[**SHOW ME - MOMOLAND**\]([https://open.spotify.com/album/2olU5yGGjXxgOt9GrFEtLo](https://open.spotify.com/album/2olU5yGGjXxgOt9GrFEtLo)): This mini makes up for the lackluster title track. You've got fun summery songs like \[What You want\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/2CLkRHfpYm3wAh8OJxVxOU](https://open.spotify.com/track/2CLkRHfpYm3wAh8OJxVxOU)) and \[Holiday\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/7qwTOfFaTgdwiBB76D6NTn](https://open.spotify.com/track/7qwTOfFaTgdwiBB76D6NTn)). Honestly, What You want should've been the title track, it's such a bop.
4. \[**THUMBS UP! - PENTAGON**\]([https://open.spotify.com/album/6AjfY47ASqK3OjjaPxTqaH](https://open.spotify.com/album/6AjfY47ASqK3OjjaPxTqaH)): Unfortunately this mini was released during the middle of the E'Dawn situation, so it was slept on. I saw so many people napping right on top of it, it was so sad. The title track is so fun, and alongside that, you've got such a bright and positive song like \[Thumbs Up!\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/1VavYuDM7cP5UTPCCM7F2j](https://open.spotify.com/track/1VavYuDM7cP5UTPCCM7F2j)) to compliment it. I'm also currently obsessed with \[When It Rains At Night\]([https://open.spotify.com/track/0C2tTlEGYQnUAVgbtJ68MB](https://open.spotify.com/track/0C2tTlEGYQnUAVgbtJ68MB)). I listen to it when I sleep, it's really nice.

3238,2019-06-25,2019,6,25,21,c57kuq,JTBC SUPER BAND: THE MAGNIFICENT SIX,hjugs7292bhouva,1561464401,"*[my crosspost from sub koreanvariety, edited necessarily]*

Have a mind to write something longer about this show, but I guess I'll make quicker note instead.

SuperBand had its latest episode 11, oh boy oh boy from what I've seen many fans was quite disappointed with the elimination round in last week episode. There's one team which almost lost its entire band members (that actually not a shocking occurrence if we remembered the result in Round 1, there was a full team whom being eliminated) and two contestants -in my opinion- were being ""in wrong place at the wrong time"" condition.

For next episode/next round we will have six teams to compete. I still have no idea how the elimination is going to work this time, whether that could be team elimination or individual elimination. Ah, audience vote finally arrives at this show after some fans -including me- pretty much being vocal that we do not need any audience voting. Yeah you know why. Nonetheless, let's see how it is gonna flip the table.

My too short analysis for the six teams:

**1. MONE _ Isaac Hong, Kim Woosung, Benji, Zairo, Hwang Minjae**

The sparklest team here, they have their safety belt on popularity. Zairo had experience to tackle three vocalists in his first round so I have no doubt he could tackle this one too. I just hope they don't overlap each other during their performance, it could be their own boomerang if they cannot manage to have proportional portion. Especially after Zairo's team incident in Round 4.

**2. PURPLE RAIN _ Lee Nawoo, Jeong Gwanghyeon, Chae Bohoon, Yang Jiwan, Kim Hajin**

Oy, Rockest of them all!!! This team is gonna be the thunder of the show (?). I love what Jiwan's team did during Paradise Lost in Round 1, accompanying with Nawoo I hope they could fix and revise their lesser point in previous rounds. So they can improve together with this team.

**3. HOPPIPPOLA _ Kim Youngsu, Hong Jinho, Ha Hyunsang, I'LL**

I'LL ~ part of my Holy Trinity final group's frontmen. Ah how he was Zairo's rival in Round 1 (both had presented the best performances in episode 4 imo) He recognized clearly what he has and going to do with his team. He understands what he willing to represent from his bandmates, acquiring Hyunsang for his team makes them more powerful.

**4. LUCY _ Shin Gwangil, Lee Juhyuk, Shin Yechan, Jo Woonsang**

Woonsang finally meet his perfect team. So happy for him. He also adding new colour in Juhyuk's team. Juhyuk is one underappreciated frontman in SuperBand. Alongside with I'LL and Zairo, these three frontmen are in their own league. His work has been impeccable since Round 1, has won four times straight from Round 1-4. I kept mentioning about I'LL and Zairo so many times, heck I rarely talked about him. Lucy deserve so much attention.

**5. PEOPLE IN THE BRIDGE _ Kim Junhyeop, Kang Kyeongyoon, Lee Chansol, Im Hyeongbin, Kim Hyeongwoo**

Man, no one can stop Chansol now, especially he is the frontman here. He is stronger and more confident in every round. Hyeongwoo addition in this team is interesting, I anticipate it. I smell new freshness and loudness from their sound.

**6. AFTERMOON _ Choi Youngjin, DPOLE, Kevin Oh, Lee Junghoon**

Oldie but goldie. I liked Kevin decision to add DPOLE. He sure attempts to add new and different flavorous style mix with his most familiar format of his band from previous rounds. Can't wait to see their experiment.

Price differs slightly depending on the venue but, GA is $25 \~ $40, with the VIP package being $200.

**VIP includes:**

* 1 GA Ticket

* Hi-Touch
   * Some of the ticketing websites specify that the Hi-Touch will consist of a wave or air high five with Tiffany.
* One photo with Tiffany (groups of 5)
* One limited edition poster signed by Tiffany Young

**Note:** Tiffany's agency may release a more official list with links later, but for the time being I compiled this list by going through each individual venues ticketing site. As such, if I didnt list certain information for some of the stops, its because the ticketing site doesnt have that info up yet.

3305,2019-06-26,2019,6,26,10,c5in4l,A Message To Select few of Kpop Fans.,ChulitoBurito,1561510885,"Today as of June 25th is the day that a popular YouTuber/Streamer who goes by name Etika or Desmond Amofah. His body has been identified in the SouthSea Seaport in NYC. 
The reason as to why Im posting this post is because a couple of Kpop stans accounts on Twitter have used the trending section involving Etika to plug in their idols. Now thats already insensitive enough but thats not the real reason why Im so furious. A select few of those twitter Kpop Stan accounts had the nerve to say that Etika deserved to die. That he deserved to kill himself. Seriously! Just how insensitive can you be? Just because the internet allows people to connect in a little bubble doesnt mean other little bubbles dont matter. Your words behind the screen do have meaning. 
The way the Kpop community was shaken up when heaven gained a precious Angel back in 2017.
Is similar to how the YouTube Gaming/ Streaming community is feeling right about now.
Even if you could care less about Jonghyun, Etika or that random person on the street please remember that each of those people have a life and have impacted various people throughout their life. Those who may not be a concern to you may mean to world to another. If youre going to Plug in your idols at least be a little bit more courteous to current events. Kpop is awesome and I agree I do want to see Kpop become more popular. However, this whole plugging idols on sensitive current twitter trends has to stop.

In closing, I want to say to whoever is reading this is that life no matter how small or trivial it may seem does indeed have meaning. As we live everyday we impact those around us in a position way. Even people who you would least expect. Dont forget that you do matter in this world. 

Life is a precious thing that we as humans seem to take for granted all too often.",5,0

[Help Me (Nuest W)](https://youtu.be/cDDtkd2AWj8) sounds very similar to [Pray/Ill Be Your Man (BTOB)](https://youtu.be/KnC3HWUs6tk).

[Run Away (Teen Top)](https://youtu.be/ti8zibttiY4) practically sounds the same as [Cookies (Hong Ki from FTIsland)](https://youtu.be/wf73ox_OHg8).

[Wings (BTS)](https://youtu.be/M05xzy7T_kE) is identical in the instrumental melody to [Feeling (BigBang)](https://youtu.be/QvvJ3fmnP8I).

[Spotlight (1THE9)](https://youtu.be/61NGBuTOB3E) is very blatantly influenced by [Airplane Pt. 2 (BTS)](https://youtu.be/NbE1HqVDEHk).

And part of the lyrics from [Run (BTS)](https://youtu.be/z75EgK60HZI) seem to be influenced by [Haru Haru (BigBang)](https://youtu.be/WtAuSC3lk14), though I dont believe it to be intentional. 

Dont tell me bye bye
You make me cry cry
Love is a lie lie
Dont tell me, dont tell me, dont tell me bye bye.

Oh, girl
I cry cry
Youre my all
Say good bye bye
Oh my love
Dont lie lie
Youre my heart
Say goodbye.

And of course theres [Dead Leaves/Autumn Leaves (BTS)](https://youtu.be/6bLTGKawFu4) and [They Never Know (EXO)](https://youtu.be/THkK2F7_iDk), but those two legitimately sampled the same [song](https://youtu.be/8amLwmLp9pg) so it hardly counts.

2019 has been an interesting year for physical albums so farthe biggest controversy in the album collection community only occuring barley a week or two ago, with the announcement of Red Velvet NOT receiving a jewel case for their mini album 'The ReVe Festival: Day 1'. But will this streak continue? Let's cross our fingers and pray to the gods that the people apart of the SM product team will never give Red Velvet a jewel case ever again. 

But other than that, I think it would be a fun subreddit event for us to celebrate the good, the weird and the trash physical albums that have blessed us this year. Were there any amazing or creative physical album designs that caught your eye in 2019 so far? Or were there any albums that just looked like they just plucked the packaging out of a dumpster that your purchased? 

**THE CATEGORIES**

1. Best Physical Album  This is in general. Is the packaging amazing? Does it come with a quality photobook? Nice photocards?

2. Best Photobook  Self explanatory. 

3. Best Poster  Also self explanatory. 

3. Most Creative Physical Album  Was their a physical album that you purchased or saw that was innovative or different but was still high quality? This is the category for these albums. 

4. Worst Photobook  Self explanatory. Blurry photos? Tiny photobook? Cheap set? This is the category for these photobooks. 

5. Worst Poster  Self explanatory. 

6. Worst Physical Album  Jewel case? Terrible packaging? Bad photobook? This is the category for these albums. 

**RULES**

1. Albums nominated must have been released THIS YEAR.

2. You can nominate a maximum of 2 albums/posters/photobooks per category. No more than 2. 

3. You can skip categories if you can't think of/haven't purchased an album that fits that category. 

**Have fun!**",7,22

I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Twice- Jeongyeon // Onces are always saying how they love Jeongyeon's voice, but for some reason never actually Stan her. Personally, she is my number one twice bias, but I can totally under their perspective.

Twice- Chaeyoung // Same reasons as Jeongyeon, but in this case I think it is people hating on her visuals. I also believe that JYP never gives her enough lines too.


Blackpink- Jisoo &amp; Ros // I think it's because BP is a Rap based group instead of a vocal group, therefore making ros and Jisoo have minimal lines and fans.",47,0

Now Im not really familiar with some of the groups at kcon (most namely everglow, verivery, ab6ix) and since Ill be going to kcon ny this year to watch these groups perform, I was just wondering what songs will these groups most likely perform besides their title track? Ab6ix will prob perform Hollywood and breathe, and verivery will perform from now as well as everglow performing bon bon chocolat. Ive been listening to these songs to prepare for kcon but Im curious as to what other songs they would perform. Everglow only has two other songs on their album and verivery has songs on their debut album to perform so I was just wondering what other songs would we most likely see from these groups? Again sorry if this question was already asked or if this is the wrong thread to ask but Im just curious since Ill be seeing these groups in a few weeks.",2,3

3473,2019-06-27,2019,6,27,10,c5z37e,As a Korean I still don't understand why BTS is so popular. Can someone give me a proper answer please...,lyfegue,1561598405,"I guess I'm older than most of you guys since I'm in early 20s.

I grew up with the generation of BB, 2pm, Shinee, Cnblue, FTIsland etc. Not hugely popular of kpop but in terms of music I don't see how BTS is marginally better at all except that they follow the modern trend of having crazier melodies and lyrics. Some of the BTS music is god awful and tbh not even Koreans think it is good but you guys in the West will get those MVs up to 200,300 million views.

I maybe thought it was the fan service they do, but none of the members are remotely fluent in English. It's not even their marketing that seems to attract attention. I will give it to them that they are far better looking than other 2017~2019 groups out there like Winner or IKON. The pioneers of kpop in my generation were not even getting a sniff of the Western market and it just really confuses me how BTS was able to do it.

Back in my day if a Kpop band was able to perform in Tokyo stadium or in Beijing national stadium that was a lifetime achievement by the band itself. 

Now everyone is literally begging BTS to come to them. That is unheard of in the history of Kpop. SNSD was able to get a rare tv appearance in Letterman years ago (which didn't go well) but for BTS it's like the cards are in their hands - they can do whatever they want.

I'm like Plato in the Cave right now trying to come up with answers and in great pain. Please put me out of misery by giving me some real answers to why BTS is so popular when bands of my generation couldn't come even close to being successful outside Korea.",4,1

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is all quite strange, but the most shocking is how [Cherry Bullet](https://open.spotify.com/album/2apkNsgo3QEqL67vY538nz) has a weird hip-hop soundtrack that was just uploaded. I'm not sure if this is an automated mistake, or if they were hacked. Anybody have any ideas?

[  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Svu\_8jLZbFo  ](https://i.redd.it/xjeub8h49x631.png)

Everyone in Kpop knows that Namjoon has said the n-word. As a black person, I have forgiven because in many Asian countries they do not learn about slavery. They are not taught about the hardships and suffering black people have endured. They hear it in rap and assume it is just a cool word used for referring to black people. The fact he was allowed to say this on live television, in a very conservative country, and it was not blurred out or muted just proves that Koreans are not aware of the meaning. In recent yearrs, Namjoon has even taken it upon himself to change the lyrics of BTS songs that are played on western radios to prevent confusion. What confusion might you ask? There is a Korean word naega (which means I/me) which sounds like the n-word. In the song, Fake Love BTS changed the lyrics to prevent any misunderstandings. [https://www.soompi.com/article/1175107wpp/btss-rm-explains-change-fake-love-lyrics-billboard-music-awards-performance](https://www.soompi.com/article/1175107wpp/btss-rm-explains-change-fake-love-lyrics-billboard-music-awards-performance) . This proves that Namjoon acknowledges his past mistakes and is making an effort to prevent them from happening again.

I tried to think of something to say to defend Mamamoo but I can't. There is absolutely no excuse for blackface. They are literally mocking black culture. It's not like they were in high school or even younger when this happened, they are literally grown women in the twenties. They were in a meeting and someone thought that it would be funny if they painted their skin brown and proceded to do a cover of a Bruno Mars (who isn't even black) song. Korean people wouldn't find it funny if I painted my skin yellow and danced to a Twice song so why should I find it funny. Blackface is harmful to society as it enforces negative stereotypes about African people and it is incredibly racist. This is why Mamamoo will never be forgiven by Western audiences.",2,0

I'm not going to lie, i was immediately let down by RV, as for skz, I really like the style, but the chorus was a bit off putting with the guy muttering about side effects. G Idle's one I was looking forward to very much, especially after seeing the teasers. The song itself wasn't great, however and the chorus was just... bland. CLC's comeback was fierce but i really disliked the digital chorus.

I've gotten into kpop for just over a year, and I'm not a good judge of music so maybe I'm just being harsh. But I really feel like the quality of songs have decreased a little this year, anyone agree?",4,0

Gallery are by no means a famous songwriter/composer but they've had two tracks on A.C.E's last album, namely [Mr. Bass](https://youtu.be/0_GNrH6j-ls) and [If You Heard](https://youtu.be/0VvR6IGiBBQ?t=61). They've also written 3/7 songs from Infinite Dongwoo's recent EP Bye.

She's an independent Korean artist and she basically vlogs about the ins and outs of her work as well as interviews other idols or former idols on what it's like to be working in the industry. She creates a fun and comfortable environment whilst also making sure to ask questions we're all dying to hear the answers to. [Her recent interview with Alex (ex-Rania)](https://youtu.be/0WfgB4bnMOI) for example was very insightful and detailed how she got into kpop, some of the controversies surrounding her debut and her time in kpop and what's she's up to these days. 

I also like watching [Luna's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06v2Mqte9cfn-3SMwpvFUA) because I just like watching vlogs whether it be beauty specific of just a day in the life themed. 

I'm curious as to what other cool YouTube Channels there are out there.",14,10

They each had nicknames (Scary, Sporty, Baby, Ginger ,and Posh). As a whole, they were known for being loud, outspoken and crazy girls. The only one who didnt give that vibe was posh. She was very sophisticated, mature and calm. She hardly smiled in pictures and seemed to be over it. But weirdly she fit in with the group.

So with that thought, I was wondering if there was a member of any group who seemed out of place, but at the same time fit in with group.",144,136

What completely shocked me were some tweets and responses that wished the worst for the little girl.(I don't want to say the specifics because they were horrendous) 

This is not the first time I have seen such sociopathic behaviour online by fans, but for me this was the harshest one so far. And I am angry and disappointed because I don't want to think that something like K-Pop(or any other fandom) could be so toxic. 

The behaviour is not normal. That is for sure, but as I was contemplating some more, I thought that there must be more to this. I have seen way too much people reacting to discussions with this ""chair but make it electric"" as almost a meme now, accompanied with the usual fancam. To them by now this might be a normal reaction, a normal behaviour because everyone seems to be doing it.

I ask this question to you and I genuinely ask this without disregard to any specific fandom, but do you think that being in such a toxic Stan environment affect us in real life? Does too much of Stan culture lead us to Sociopaths or stanning just bring out those traits? 

I am not in a position to give proper judgement but I am researching and would really like to hear your opinion on this.",28,0

The vast majority of K-pop M/Vs (well M/Vs in general, not just in K-pop) follow somewhat of a storyline, some even connect to paint a bigger picture. But only a select number have enough substance to be explored and expanded on much further in the form of a full length film. Which ones do you think are a part of the ""select number""?    If you wish, you can elaborate on your choice(s) and even get creative and imaginative using the form below (you don't have to fill out the whole thing)

What do we know/heard so far then? These are quotes based from the translations of the *ever so reliable*, kpop resident translator [oh_mes](https://twitter.com/OH_mes2?s=09):

- confirmed by representatives

- song(s) &amp; choreo are set

- how many members participating in this haven't been confirmed, thus things like MV filming, jacket photoshoot etc also haven't been confirmed as well

- members like Somi (center) &amp; Yeonjung (main vocalist) rumoured to not participating in this reunion project

Now, what we don't know yet:

- how many members participating, of course

- when the dates &amp; schedules are settled

- which label will be appointed to handle the whole activities of the group

On the last point, i wanted to ask both Flovers &amp; Wiz*ones thoughts too because there's a possibility that Off The Record might be the one managing the project. 

You see, IOI used to be under YMC/Swing (CMIIW), but earlier today it was reported that the winning group of Produce X 101 will be managed by Swing, so the possibility of OTR managing them is still up there. *Do you think there would be any significant repercussions for both Fromis_9 &amp; IZ*ONE had OTR is chosen to handle IOI's reunion? Are you open to the idea or not, and why?*

So yeah, are you excited? Or maybe feeling concerned or maybe disappointed for some reason? How do you think it'll pans out? Why do you think they finally go for it, despite busy schedules and/or initial '5 year' plan?",12,0

[The origins of ""Stanning"" isn't exactly something people should openly be identifying with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOMhN-hfMtY) Being biased and obsessed with one person or group and doing anything you possibly can to protect their integrity and honor by any means possible isn't really healthy for anybody involved. You shouldn't obsess over one thing so much that it almost becomes your identity. The reason the kpop fandom has such a toxic reputation worldwide is because of the way they militarize in order to defend their groups honor at even the slightest hint of disrespect and the childlike internet behavior of the kpop fans who hide behind their pfp of their favorite idol.

For example when a TV host complimented NCT Johnny's English skills even though he was born in America and was a native English speaker, that TV host was called racist and ignorant and forced to apologize for a simple and unimportant mistake. How do you think the TV host and any outsider looking in at this controversy would perceive the kpop fanbase?

tl;dr You should be making an active effort to engage in less toxic stanning behavior because it's doing the exact opposite of what you want which is more western mainstream media attention and it is  giving kpop fanbases the toxic annotations to outsiders who could potentially want to get into kpop but dont want to associate with the fans",5,0

3764,2019-06-29,2019,6,29,0,c6lsi6,New to k-pop - looking for catchy girl group songs recommendations,Bug_Catcher_Joey,1561736933,"Hey guys, like the title says, I never cared much about k-pop. I knew it existed but that's it. Then in April I was in Seoul and on my way back to the hotel on the last day there I accidentally stumbled upon a street concert (I guess) of Saturday ([this one actually](https://youtu.be/yPya1VEuW1E?t=868)). And I loved it! 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it's completely not my cup of tea musically but something about those girls having perfectly choreographed dances to such catchy songs just keeps making me very happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I've been trying to find similar catchy songs like [MMook JJi BBa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tJ1k7AP-o) and [WiFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L8FXg8zbDA). I got to the more popular ones like Doo Doom Chit or BBoom BBoom but there's probably a ton of great songs I'm missing because youtube won't recommend them to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love any recommendations for those kinds of catchy and fun girl groups / songs! It would give me a place from which I could start exploring the genre more. Thanks!",1,1

3776,2019-06-29,2019,6,29,2,c6mywk,Whats the most delusional thing you have heard a shipper say?,BlinkTwiceforRV,1561742697,"So, we all know shippers are delusional in general. Im not talking about the people who appreciate cute friendships, but those who genuinely think idols are secretly in love. Im bisexual, and I kinda find the LGBT ships even more offensive because they are essentially trying to out people, which is NEVER ok. Obviously these ships arent real but these people believe them so the intention IS to expose them. 

But what is the thing a shipper has said that has made you despair/ laugh the most?

Mine would be a Jensoo shipper saying Jennie was forced to post photos with Lisa. Yes, Im being serious. So apparently when Jennie posts photos of Jisoo it is proof they are in love, but when she does with Lisa? Pretty much held at gunpoint. Ditto a Jensoo shipper saying Jennie hated Lisa because she archived a photo with Lisa, despite the fact she also archived photos with Jisoo too and is prone to archiving photos in general! Jensoo and Jenlisa fans both lost their minds during JenKai too, their reaction was something to behold. 

This brings me neatly on to my next pick.. Taekook shippers insisting that Jungkook despises Jimin and that the company forces him to post photos with him because they are using Jikook as a cover for Taekook. So to cover up a gay relationship... they use another gay relationship. Right. Jikook vs Taekook is another ship war that gets completely wild!",2,0

I'm a 25-year-old girl and I got into K-pop about a year ago. I like being part of this community, but looking at idols constantly has made quite a negative impact on my self-esteem. I realise that they have a whole team dedicated to make them look good, I know they spend years figuring out their best angles and learning how to pose and carry themselves, etc., but I still feel like shit compared to them. And it's not even about girls - I follow boy bands mostly, and even when I look at men (like GOT7's Jinyoung or JB - they are my absolute ideals of men), I feel like I could never be as beautiful as they are (again, I'm a girl...), or men like them would never desire me - I don't know which thought is more stupid and harmful, but I can't help having them. I feel like I should have gone past this fragile self-image stage in my teens, but I seem stuck in it, and K-pop does not help at all, on the contrary. I am more painfully aware of my awkward body proportions, of my huge nose, my thin hair, thin lips, etc. - it's like I wish I looked ""Korean"" with thick lips, thick hair, small frame, small nose, etc. I know it's silly and stereotyping, given that Korea is a diverse nation with lots of different looks, but I can't help it. I actually lie on the bed for hours, hating every inch of my body that would not look desirable in the eyes of a (frankly, imagined, but still) Korean community. Do you have any advice for me, or any experience similar to mine? I'm interested in hearing what you think. I don't want to give up on stanning K-pop groups, but it seems like nothing healthy is coming out of this.

I hope I didn't offend anyone with this ""wanting to look Korean"" thing. I know it's shallow. Plus, I don't mean it in a koreaboo way, I would never try to make myself look that drastically different. It's just the thoughts that come to me and suffocate me.",9,2

It made me miss the funny videos I would watch of second and early third generation Kpop variety where you'd have all these groups frequently showing up on the same shows together but that really only happens today with new groups getting billed together on Weekly Idol  
   
I tried to think of something eloquent to make a discussion around, but I couldn't come up with anything so let's reminisce of our favorite moments of multiple groups together.

It seems to go unnoticed, but she really never gives up on practically anything. For example, the infamous fancam - no matter how many times she fell down, she kept going and dusted herself off. And it's not just one fancam either, she's always seen with bruises from practice, et cetera. Plus, despite being one of the members that doesn't have to diet, she manages herself super well. Not to mention, her vocals had consistently been improving (until lately because of how hard they were promoting, but otherwise). I know there are probably better examples, but the vibe I get from her just radiates ""hard-working"" and I feel it's not acknowledged too much.",39,0

I dont know if it is, because shes been living in the U.S. for so long or because the songs have that kind of style I wish Ariana Grande would have done instead of her newest music. The album just slaps, and the english songs are so good.

*[my crosspost from sub koreanvariety]*

We all know Mon got the lowest score in episode 12. No need to explain it too detailed over again on how the stage was going last night. Judges praised them, gave them (one of) the highest score. HOWEVER since final rounds are involving audience voting, it ""ruined"" the party. Mon was thrown away to the lowest rank, you absolutely could have seen how were the reaction among Mon themselves (I bet Jungjae awfully cursed in his head at everyone last night), shocked judges (Yoon Jongshin's expression was mine), even other contestants had their concerned faces during the announcement.

Thinking back that SuperBand is not really targeted to younger/teenager audiences, I have a positive hope they shall get their shite together before they did the voting. Well... such as looking at every performance less biased, not based on popularity, and considering judges opinion as valid input. Yet, turned out those are /close to non existence/.

&gt; Not based on popularity
This is one anomaly. Mon has been known as the most popular team among the fans, judges, and other contestants. To swing everyone's vote to pick them I might say --- a piece of cake. I was once too worried that they might overshadow the other teams, but again, that was another side of card.

I wonder; is that audiences' age really take the big role for yesterday episode? Or audiences simply favored different turn of genre (People on the Bridge and Purple Rain had so much love from the audiences)?

For you who has been watching SuperBand episode 12, what is your opinion about this? Do you think Mon has their chance to slap audiences right away with their performance next week?",0,0

As of the moment this post goes live, submissions are officially open! For now, let's say they'll close **SATURDAY JULY 20th**. That'll give you plenty of time to learn those raps and work on your Jimin shrieks!

If you have no idea what this post is about, we just released our last cover ([Gfriend's NAVILLERA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI8prv-i3Bw)) last night, and our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ) channel is home to our previous releases as well.

#HOW TO RECORD AND SUBMIT YOUR VOCALS

Follow these steps and save us all a lot of pain please. If you already know how to record your voice, skip ahead to step 7.

**Step 1.** Download Audacity (or open Garageband if you're on a Mac.) If you don't have a phone or computer that has a microphone, borrow one. Ask nicely. More specifics on recording with Audacity [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hvurc/project_ranime_sings_colors_by_flow_code_geass_op/?st=j9westlp&amp;sh=fdeb6d0e), via /u/IbrahimT13

**Step 2**. Get some headphones and plug them in. We want to hear ONLY YOUR VOICE, not the song too. If the headphones have a mic, make sure your input in the program is *not* set to that channel, as it's probably inferior to the mic of the computer or phone. 

**Step 3**. Cue up INU on either Itunes/Spotify or [THIS link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCQ3i5MMUJQ) on your browser. 

**Step 4.** ~~Open this page and scroll down to the officially sanctioned pronunciation guide below.~~ COMING SOON, watch for a reminder post that includes it, and I'll update it here too! (If you're recording before our Official Pronunciation Guide is up (we luv our early birds), feel free to sing along to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCQ3i5MMUJQ) lyric video or [these](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2016/07/gfriend-yeojachingu-navillera-neo-geuligo-na) romanizations.

**Step 5**. Put those headphones in your ears, hit record on the software, hit play on the song, then sing your heart out. Remember that kpop groups are *multiple people*. It is not possible to sing all of the lines in immediate order without losing breath or doubling up, so do a bunch of takes. If this is confusing, the easiest thing to do for this song is to record **each member's part** as a separate track. Basically, use common sense: **DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF**. It's alright if you send us a bunch of different audio tracks! It's *not* alright if you record every single word individually and don't bother to combine them. That's *super* annoying!!!

**Step 6**.  If you wanna sing harmonies and adlibs (highly encouraged) please record those as SEPARATE files and include them in the email. Again, **DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF**. 

**Step 7**. Save your masterpieces as a .wav (preferrably in 48kHz), .m4a (preferrably 256kbps or higher), or .flac file and **email that sucker to redditkpop101@gmail.com**. If your files are too big (happens often) please zip them up and send us a download (via mega/mediafire, whatever) link. I know it's tempting, but we'd REALLY prefer you **NOT share a google drive link**, the permissions can get confusing. Several people weren't included on Red Flavor because they never responded to my emails begging them to fix the permissions. Don't be that person, it makes me so sad.

&amp;nbsp;

If you found this stupid and confusing, [here is a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBMhf53SSC8). If you're still stupid and confused or have a question about the process, please post it below. Either I or our audio God/ARMY, /u/rreg29 will answer to the best of our extent.

&amp;nbsp; 

**Some general recording tips. (Adapted from /u/IllllllllI's post).**

* Try to minimize background noise as much as possible, unless it's funny, and then we'll use it in the credits. Close windows if they were open, turn off machines if they were on etc. It's hot af in the Northern hemisphere right now, so please try to turn off A/C while you record.

* If you love the idea of this project and want to contribute long-term, consider buying a little standalone USB microphone. I can personally vouch for the quality and durability of [this](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-iCE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B014PYGTUQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517946380&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=USB+microphone&amp;dpID=31Ju5HK-6bL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch) one for basic use. There are cheaper options on amazon now, but I'm not familiar with them. The editing team will thank you (and probably use more of your vocals, how about that!)

* Don't sing too close to your mic - it causes clipping/distortion.

* If you have the resources, consider **HAND-MAKING** a [quick pop filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Ut4s4ME8Y) for your mic. It'll sound a jillion times better and we thank you for it. 

* Do **NOT** apply ANY effects or filters to your vocal track. The ""pop filter"" we're referring to above is made from a tissue. Send us the raw vocal file.

* I don't actually really have any specific tips for this song... this is probably the least vocally challenging one we've done so far. If it's out of your range dudes, feel free to octave down but don't change the key. Ladies...you should be fine, but if parts are too low (esp the raps), octave up. Love us some brat rap.

* The only real tip I have about managing the raps is to take them one line at a time and try to clap along to the rhythm as you're learning it, that's what's helped me and my test subject so far. Hopefully our pronunciation guide will help with that a bit too? Idk, we'll figure it out together.

* Higher notes are easier to sing if you sing confidently/loudly and with good breath support. 

*  If you have to go screamo or shouty to hit the notes (LOOKIN AT U JIMIN), back away from your microphone please, and keep an eye on the levels of your recording. If you're super loud (like me!!) drop them a bit so your vocals aren't in the red end of the bar the whole time. It's easier to make quiet vocals louder, than louder vocals quieter. (I personally record the majority of my vocal takes from across my apartment on 50% mic volume and am *still* too loud). 

* All in all, this is a SUPER FUCKIN FUN SONG, and I think we're going to be amazing. I can't wait to see how this [mess turns out](https://media.giphy.com/media/yFbULkPiVev7O/giphy.gif) &lt;3

For me personally I just never felt the urge to buy an album when I could just stream. But with Kpop when The War: The Power of Music came out I realized I HAD to have it. Im so glad I did because its such a beautiful album and I was so happy getting pictures of each member with their superpower. I know physical album sales are decreasing around the world due to streaming services. But with BTS selling over 3 million copies of their recent album it made me think if the same thing that happened to album sales in the west will happen to physical album sales in Korea.,39,87

By the time I had got into Kpop we started having groups like Twice emerging onto the scene and then apparently Im cursed or something but that year 2NE1,Sistar,Wonder Girls all disbanded. But from what I can see it seems like these groups were all massive in their prime. As someone who only hopped on the Kpop train at the start of 3rd gen, Im curious to hear about the groups in that era and what were the big things people were talking about,etc.",198,209

3927,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,c7a97k,Labels buying Youtube views for their nugu groups?,savedduserr,1561877919,"Im not sure if Im right in my assumptions but Ive noticed a trend of nugu groups all of a sudden having millions of views when they really dont have the reputation behind the views. I was watching [this](https://youtu.be/S0qO3mo6R5w) video of the most viewed Kpop videos of 2019 thats updated weekly showing the amnt of views each video received in the past week. I couldnt help but notice that some songs with millions of views, that were released fairly recently, dont get many views weekly.

Examples:
OnlyOneOf - [Savanna](https://youtu.be/dS3cIsz82i0) (has 8M+ views and gets less than 20k weekly besides being released only a month or so ago)
GWSN - [Pinky Star](https://youtu.be/VZ8kYn_o5RY) (has nearly 20M views but gets 40k views weekly)
VAV - [Thrilla Killa](https://youtu.be/waN7F0nSLk8) (has 23M+ views but less than 60k weekly)

And I would normally be just accepting of the fact that they mustve gotten a lot of hype for their song, but the songs that are also released on distributor channels (1theK, Genie) are the ones that pop up in search results. And those videos on those channels have a measly fraction of the videos released on the artists channels. Search results are based off of genuine viewership and what videos users actually watch, so this makes me believe that labels are actually buying views. Anyone else notice this or is it just me?",120,90

3931,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,18,c7b3yx,You Made My Day: Scentographer [DAY6 2nd Fanmeeting],NessieSenpai,1561885477,"Yesterday was the second DAY6 fanmeeting. I rocked up at a rather close time to the beginning of the show because it was a very humid day and I wanted to have a nap in the afternoon because I had a TOPIK lesson that morning. I had a seat on the 3rd floor but I was at the front of it. A relatively good view but, as with most of these older venues in Seoul, the seats were too small for me and I spent most of the show trying to get a good position for my legs and to get my large thighs to fit into the space (spoiler: they didn't)

The set up for the stage was gorgeous - green and leafy with all these pretty garden lights around to give it an outdoor feel. Great stage lighting too, no-one was ever in the dark.

Now for the show itself. The boys were WILDIN' in the beginning, particularly Jae (who was super happy that he was able to attend this fan meeting) and Wonpil (who is always hyper anyways) as both was constantly going BRRAAAP and SKKRRRTT right at the start. It's a bit of a tradition for me to do it back (or do it first) at these shows so I when I did my own, Young K was all, ""OHO!"" as if to confirm that I was there. I did it again towards the end of the show and the boys did it back. It's expected now, I guess!

It was a nice, chill feeling. The last time I was constantly feeling anxious as Jae was sick and it was so weird to see them on stage as four, but this time it felt complete. You could tell the boys were much happier and relaxed this time around. They had a great selection of segments and games this time around, including creating a new song made with lyrics from the suggestion of MYDAYS. There was also a game where Jae had to draw pictures to represent a song and the others were split into pairs to match two halves of the same song. It was a mess though, noone could work out was Jae was trying to show and by the time Young K and Wonpil understood Jae's mind, Dowoon and Sungjin kept messing it up xD 

The performances were great as usual, though I am surprised there was no **Shoot Me**, but hearing **Pouring** and **What Can I Do** is always a great concert treat to listen to live. They performed a new song too called **Best Part** and guys... it was amazing! I feel like it will be a track on the new album so listen out for it! What was great was that Wonpil and Jae's special song from last year, **Stop Being Cute**, was finally performed with Jae and all members joined them on stage for extra cuteness! And they did another part/instrument switch for **I Loved You** (Young K was on the drums and he was so excited for it, like I have never seen him so happy! He tried a drumstick twirl and ended up dropping one of them much to his embarrassment!)

All in all, it was a great time! All members kept talking about how great it was to finally have Jae with them (it really was) and the overall mood was celebration. At the end, they showed that prologue that was released yesterday so everyone is in a buzz for a comeback. And they did a very nice thing on their VCR where they showed all the names of the fans who were there/bought tickets. It was nice to see my name on the big screen as you feel even more as a family then. There were a lot of foreign fans up there too! Thank you, DAY6!!",3,109

I heard about Jonghyun's passing before I was into kpop and it was upsetting but I didn't dwell on it too much since I didn't know much about it at the time. Getting to learn a lot more about it I felt strangely relatable to the whole incident and can't help feel bittersweet seeing anything with him in it. 

Something I've noticed is that a lot of kpop fans tend to be very emotional and for many of us, kpop is essentially what makes our day a lot better. For some of us, it's what keeps us going through tough times.

I've found myself looking to kpop to get through dark periods recently and watching old videos with Jonghyun in it, I was wondering how it affected you. For those of you who struggle with your own issues and those of you who were just fans, how did the news affect you?",91,0

Of course, its impossible for me to go over every single detail from every sign, this would be an entire book if I did. And I felt like it was too many events to split up in to different posts and turn in to spam -- so Im going to make an overview of all of the fansigns for a general account! I hope you enjoy!

First, I have been attending Loona fansigns for quite a while, and I try to go to every single event if possible (fansign, concert, fanmeets, festivals, etc). I attended all six Butterfly promotion fansigns. I attended the Loonaverse concert for both days, but due to the Kakao M album production issue, the fansigns did not start until a couple of weeks after the concert. 

Second, I need to give a big huge thankful shout out to r/Loona for being instrumental in me attending so many fansigns. I opened a group order for albums to help myself get in, and due to their support, I was able to get in to all that I tried for. Thank you!! Im going to break down highlights by members, and group all their  fansigns together in to each member section for ease of reading!

**HEEJIN**

Heejin and I have a love-hate relationship. Okay, thats obviously exaggerated, I love Heejin to death, and she is truly one of the sweetest people on the entire planet. What I mean is -- Heejin is always seated first at fansigns no matter which order they are sitting in (for half of the Butterfly fansigns, they switched up the seating order). 

This means that Im always the MOST awkward with Heejin, simply because Im always still quite nervous. It takes some time to get through all twelve girls at the fansigns, and by the time youre halfway through and its been 15 minutes, youve gotten comfortable enough to open up and not be as withdrawn and nervous with the members. Poor Heejin always gets me (and everyone else) at their most nervous! The first two fansigns, I was exceptionally socially inept and barely was able to talk to her, since it had been some time since Id seen them at the ++ fansigns. I stumbled over my Korean a lot, but she was always so patient with me! One time, she grabbed my hand and said its okay, slow down~ Talk slowly, dont be nervous! 

Also, its well known that Heejin is incredibly pretty. She has very unique features -- a lot of Koreans think she is mixed, only half-Korean, because they think she looks a bit foreign. In person she is so delicate and her deep voice is really smoothing. Shes very patient with my annoying dumb self!

She says her favorite song on xx is Curiosity, and favorite ++ song is Yeolgi (Heat). When asked her favorite solo, she told me couldnt choose, but if she could choose one to perform herself, shed like to do Egoist! She said Butterfly made her feel proud as a member of Loona, because of the strong message it had for their female fans. I asked her which country shed like to visit for fun (not work) if she could choose anywhere. She said shed want to go back to Europe!


**HYUNJIN**

Hyunjin is a really hilarious person to me. I think shes such a troll -- but her unassuming appearance and innocent demeanor makes people underestimate her. Shes ALWAYS playing with, annoying, bothering, laughing at, and being silly to the other members. I think her cutest interactions are always with Yeojin. Her and Yeojin mess around a lot. Hyunjin also is really cute with Haseul, the pair play around a lot during fansigns! I LOVE her. 

At the first fansign, I told her that if I got another cat, I would name it Bread, for her. She looked at me with these huge saucer-like eyes and goes Dont do that. LMAO. Thats it, just dont do that. I laughed so hard I didnt even get a chance to say much else. The third fansign, I told her that Around You was still one of my absolute favorite of the solo songs, and she grabbed both of my hands and started singing the song to me, serenading me right then and there on the spot. I swear I almost jumped bias ship that day.

Hyunjin is one of those people that you look at her and at her MVs and think shes a very soft spoken, quiet, innocent person, but in reality shes SUPER mischievous and has this great, super dry sense of humor. At the last fansign for xx, when they were in casual clothes, I said that I liked Hyunjins personal sense of style, since she had dressed herself. Then she looked at me and goes This is the first thing I pulled out of my closet, in the most deadpan voice ever. Anyways, the lesson today is that we should all stan Hyunjin and stream Around You.

**HASEUL**

I know its all missing Haseul hours right now until she comes back from hiatus, but at the fansigns she was all positive energy and bubbly, just like we all know her to be. Haseul is one of the easier members for me to talk to, and I dont really know why. Of course, ALL of them are easy to get along with and talk to, but Haseul is just a very warm and open person, and really is the mom friend. She really takes you under her wing. Her English is very good since she studied in America, so even though her and I mainly speak in Korean -- she still can understand me if I dont know a word in Korean. 

I told Haseul at EVERY. SINGLE. FANSIGN. That I really really loved her short hair. She told me when they first brought up the idea of cutting it to her, she was all for it, but she shortly after they cut it she was nervous about it. She wasnt sure if she was genuinely in to it. But after it leaked and especially after the concert when her hair was confirmed and she saw all the super positive keyboard smashing about it, she said she regained a lot of self confidence in it, and now she realizes its a good style on her!

I asked her what she thought her strongest song on xx was (as in, which song did she personally perform the best?) and she thought Where U At and Colors were her personal strongest! But she really loved Satellite and Butterfly as well as really the entire album.

**YEOJIN**

The cutest resident lentil bean, maknae Yeojin. Yeojin is one of the most determined members to get you to come out you shell there is. She draws on you with her sign pen, grabs your hands, fingers, arms, anything she can get her hands on really. She looks at you really deeply while youre talking to her and really listens to everything you have to say! Yeojin always remembers my name and calls me unnie whenever I see her at the events. 

Yeojin also has really good English. Even though I converse with most members in Korean, she actually really likes to talk in English to practice. I think being the youngest, he English skills are still fresh in her mind from school, and she also has a lot of confidence to practice. At the last fansign, she was telling me about her hobby, but had to ask Haseul to translate words she didnt know, and it was so cute! The person behind me who was talking to Haseul was a friend, so she didnt mind interrupting to ask Haseul to translate for her. 

Yeojin told me about her favorite hobby, which is nail art, and how she practices on herself and Olivia a lot. She wanted to really practice a lot over the break between xx and Burn. She said she is going to ask BBC if theyll let her do some nail art stuff or show of her work/do vlives and such on Loonas various social media!

She said the only downside to Butterfly and Hi High promotions was that her tight hairstyles sometimes gives her a headache and the ++ era especially her hair took so long to style :P

**VIVI**

VIVIIIIIII! Vivi is just so, so sweet and also incredibly hard working. She is ALWAYS putting in extra hours to perfect her Korean for not only her group members and company, but for fans as well. Of all the members, Vivis English is the best. Because my Korean isnt perfect and she is also still learning (but hers is still better than mine) she is actually the one member it is *easier* for me to speak with in English than Korean. I believe it comes from her being from Hong Kong, where English is a very commonly spoken language and also one of the official ones, in addition to Cantonese. However, when fans who speak Cantonese occasionally do get to converse with her in her native tongue at fansigns, you can instantly tell the difference in her demeanor! While speaking in Korean and English, she is a bit more reserved and has to think about her answers and what she wants to say, but as soon as a fan speaks to her in her native tongue she gets super animated and bubbly and excited. It really is super heartwarming to see, and Im sure it makes her feel genuinely happy as well!

Vivi is also a really great artist. Ive gotten post its form her before where I asked her to draw things and she has such an elegant, feminine, and beautiful art style. I asked her what she would want to do if she werent an idol, and she said she missed her modeling days, but mostly shed want to be a creative. Shed want to be an artist and paint. I asked her if she would ever consider uploading her art to Loonas sns, or draw on camera, and she said shes afraid shed be too shy but if Orbits wanted to see it, she might try!

I asked her what the hardest part about living in a foreign country was, as I too live in Korea but come from a far away place. She said making deep connections was hard at first, because she wanted to talk to people but the language barrier made it hard. She said she is a very open minded person and likes to connect with people and its hard when language limits that. But, she said, shes very happy here, and wouldnt want to be anywhere else.

**KIM LIP**

As I said in my past fan accounts for Loona, Kim Lip has always been the easiest for me to talk to. I dont know what it is, maybe its just her and I that click the most, or we are on the same level as far as interaction goes, but I always look forward to talking to her the most! 

I know its pretty obvious at this point, but Kim Lip is a fucking visual. Shes incredibly gorgeous in person. Her dark hair is a huge departure from her blonde, and she said that she was nervous about it at first because most fans had gotten to know her only with blonde, and she was nervous that they wouldnt like the dark hair as much. But now, she thinks it makes her look sexy. 

She also said that right now, shes trying to really study English. She really loves all the international fans and feels bad that she cant communicate with them as much as possible. She gets a lot of fan letters and messages from international orbits on the fan cafe, but she wishes she could understand them more and even respond back. So, she told me shes been really studying hard, and wants to learn more English. She suggested we study together -- her English, me Korean! I said by the next comeback, both of us will be fluent. She shook her head and said Unnie I think Im going to let you down one more time (The first time was apparently when she promised she would learn English by xx comeback :P)

**JINSOUL**

Full disclosure: Jinsoul is my bias. My ult girl group bias. I love her more than anything in the world, and I always make sure to tell her that when I see her at fansigns. At first, Jinsoul and I were a bit awkward because of my language barrier, but now that Ive been improving and weve chatted on more occasions and Ive given her lots of gifts and fanletters, Im a lot less awkward and more comfortable! She now remembers me by name and is really sweet when its my turn to see her, and Im very grateful for that. 

At the third fansign she said she thinks my Korean is getting better, and I asked her if shes studying any languages right now. She said shes studying a bit of Japanese, so maybe its for their upcoming Japanese debut? She told me shed seen some of the pictures from fansigns that Ive posted and said theyre really nice, so I was having a slight (read: MAJOR) fangirl panic moment knowing shed seen my photos.

At her solo fansign, she asked me if I had dyed my hair. At the Butterfly fansigns I had my natural dirty blonde hair color, but before her solo Id dyed it black. She said that the black hair looked nice on me, and I thanked her for remembering. I asked her if she was interested in dying her hair soon too, or if she was happy with her blonde. She didnt answer verbally, she looked at me with what I can only describe as the  emoji. She looked like she WANTED to say something/give a spoiler, but wasnt able to :P Maybe well get dark haired Jinsoul for Burn after all

I also told her I was SUPER happy that they were doing solo fansigns again -- and she said yes, its been a long time, hasnt it? I asked her (and other members) to do more in the future. She said she wanted to, and that maaaaaaybe it was in the cards I asked if maybe Unit fansigns were as well, and she said she doesnt know if its in the plan yet, but she would love to either do a Mix/Max &amp; Match anniversary fansign, or do newer Unit stuff!

**CHOERRY**

Choerry is an impossible ray of sunshine, literally vitamin C in human form. You just cant be sad around her. Shes a very fanservicey person, loves to interact with the audience and pose for cute pictures, as well as act 4D and weird for fun. 

Choerry also likes to practice her English although well, she really really tries lol. Her English is quite good actually! But shes also says the funniest things. One time she asked me if I would ever consider keeping cockroaches as pets, since a fan had given her a toy one at this particular fansign. I told her I would be way too scared to own cockroaches and she said she heard theyre super loyal and friendly. I gave her the most horrified face I could muster and she laughed and said if she ever wanted to get a scary pet that the members would kick her out.

Choerry said she couldnt pick a favorite song on xx, because she liked them all and also really loved to perform them, but one of her favorites to perform is Colors.

At her solo fansign, I told her that Id bought a lot of albums (because of my group order) to get in and that a lot of international orbits really wanted to own her albums. She said that made her really excited. When I told her how many I bought, she made the &gt;:O face and said thats way too many and WHY?! I said because I really wanted to see you of course! I told her I hope she is happy today and she told me If I eat unnies love, Ill always be happy.

**YVES**

Yves is another member that I really vibe with. Yves is totally unfair in person, she is sooooo kind and loves to give lots of fanservice. When you speak to her, she looks at you like youre the most important person in the world. She remembered that I used to have a different hair color and at her solo fansign, she asked if I had dyed it recently, and said the black looks very nice on me. (big uwu)

I told her I had been watching Gashinas lately and that the show really made me miss my grandmother a lot, and it was a very wholesome, if not emotional, show. She said, You cried a lot while watching right? Sometimes I cried when we filmed emotional scenes. I miss my granny a lot, too. She said she felt really lucky to be a part of such a wonderful project.

I also apologized for my Korean when I stumbled over some words, and she said You always say that and I always say its good! (Which is true, I do). When she said she noticed I dyed my hair I told her she has a good memory, and she retorted back immediately with And *you* have good Korean!

At the first xx fansign I had brought with me a jacket I had custom made that I called the orbit jacket, which had various pins, patches, and lettering that related to Loona. Originally, I had brought the jacket to show it to all the members. Yves saw it and told me that she really wanted one. She asked how much she could pay to have me make her one and I told her that Ill give her mine at the next fansign! Which is really funny in retrospect, because I actually. Really really loved that jacket lol, I kind of wish I didnt give it away, but since it was given to Yves, Im happy. :) She really loved it and wore it for a bit, and at the next fansigns she said her mom keeps it now (she doesnt trust it at the dorm!) and had put it up on display in her house!! Heres a few pictures of it and her with it and when she wore it for a little while! :) https://imgur.com/a/fmnxyQN 

**CHUU**

I still maintain today and until the end of my days that Chuu was born to be an idol. She has the perfect demeanor for it, the perfect social skills, and knows exactly what to do or say to bring a smile to someones face. She is PERFECT at fanservice. No on has her beat! Like Choerry, she just exudes a happy, bright energy that is totally infectious.

Ive said it before, but one of my favorite things about Chuu is that she loves skinship. Every single fansign Ive ever gone to, no matter what, she ALWAYS holds my hands while I talk to her. She takes both of my hands in hers and holds them while we speak. She also is really encouraging when I stumble on my Korean. She helps me slow down and also helps me try to say things (when she can understand). Her English is really cute. She also really, really, reallyreallyreallyREALLY loves America. Anything about America. The food, the cities, the buildings, the music. She wants to go to America SO BAD. She asked me if she could come back to America with me, but I told her that even though Im American, I live in Korea :P She said that her home is where I am. She said her and I should study English together so she can go to America with confidence.

I said that I need to study harder myself. She said Im already good and dont need to. But, wont that make me lazy? I told her. She squeezes my hands and says, Isnt laziness the key to happiness?

**GO WON**

Go Won and I are admittedly an awkward pair :) And not in a bad way! Go Won is a very soft spoken and thoughtful person, and doesnt talk or ramble more than she needs to, which I respect! Shes exceptionally sweet and so so so pretty. Shes also TINY -- incredibly petite in every single way. Shes very soft and dainty all over. I was worried that since I am usually a bit awkward with her at OT12 fansigns, that at her solo it would be even more so. But!

I was pleasantly surprised that she seemed more relaxed at the solo fansign! She remembered my name and some things I said to her at the xx fansigns, and also that I had played Rock Paper Scissors with her from the audience at previous fansigns. I told her I wanted to challenge her at all upcoming events to a game and keep score of who wins the most. I asked her if shed like to play and she got really excited and immediately put her hand down to do it! We did best 2 out of 3 and tied twice, but she ended up faking me out and beating me in the end. Ill keep you updated on who wins in the coming months :*

I asked her if she would like to try any new hair colors or if she preferred blonde. She said she thinks her blonde hair looks really nice on her skin tone and that she wouldnt mind keeping it for a while longer, but if they wanted to change her hair color she would also be excited to try anything new!

**OLIVIA HYE**

In a previous fan account thread, I said that Olivia was my precious awkward gothic baby, and that still holds true. Olivia is a real knock out, in person she just exudes this mysterious cool persona, but when you talk to her shes actually a full stop nerd who loves to ramble about geeky stuff and things shes been into lately. I love her deep, husky voice a lot. I think it adds to her cool persona.

Because most of the time Olivia is last, I usually get to chat with her a bit longer, and my favorite thing is to ask her is what her favorite game/anime/show/movie etc is right now, because she usually likes to talk at length excitedly about the things she likes, and its really cute! She said shed love to practice new and old concepts alike and that she was really excited to do both the Fire and Cherry Bomb covers. She said shed love to do even more Loona songs with hard choreo, but when they have to sing too its a bit hard, which I totally understand. But she really loves doing the boys choreo just as much as Loonas!

At one of the xx fansigns I asked her which OT12  song was her favorite, as well as her favorite solo. She said she likes Hi High, favOriTe, and Curiosity a lot. Her favorite solo -- she couldnt pick. But she still really loves Egoist lmao.


Well that about does it for me! I have a few more extra misc pictures [this way](https://imgur.com/a/L0WA7lX), including from the two days of LOONAVERSE concert as well as fansigns. Its not much, but Ill upload the HQs I took over time (when Im not so busy!) I know that was a long read, but twelve fansigns is a lot. Thank you for reading this massive wall of text if you made it this far! Lately I have been trying to post more short snippets and also do lives from events on twitter. 

I hope to continue writing Loona fan accounts for a long time (maybe not as long though that remains to be seen). I also want to again thank r/Loona and everyone who joined my group order for albums, as well as I hope that all Orbits one day get the opportunity to meet the girls in real life some day! Theyre totally and unequivocally worth it, all 12 are amazing, talented, kind individuals! Who is your bias? Who would you love to meet one day?
