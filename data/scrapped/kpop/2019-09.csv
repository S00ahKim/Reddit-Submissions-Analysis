I've done a little searching and (as I found nothing) was wondering, Had there ever been a special like that before? Has there ever been one like it since? Will there ever be one again? It seemed like such a huge undertaking getting that many idols and bosses from different companies together like that. Anyone got anything?

For those of you who are not aware of the special and / or what it was:

""""The Boss is Watching"" is a SBS's special show to celebrate the Lunar New Year. In the program included 120 idols from 20 different K-Pop groups and each group competed with the rest to be the best. The bosses of each group helped them to show their best in each competition. The groups competed in 5 different categories: stamina, intelligence, individual abilities, luck and teamwork""",1,4

[BTS: Anpanman](https://youtu.be/WVj9yxOTlks)- I cant get out of my mind the boys jumping and playing in the inflatables in the the LY:SY tour. It really put a smile in my face seeing this live. 

 [Nell: Loop](https://youtu.be/l_F5dabUXnM)- Im not sure why this song in particular but it makes me feel so chill and hopeful. Plus the vocals are amazing. 

[Epik High: Here Come the Regrets](https://youtu.be/kU6ACUI2EUY)- Lee Hi and Epik High are always amazing together. I can feel all the emotions written in the song while listening to it. 

[Hwasa and Loco: Dont](https://youtu.be/2--6PyJ9hr0)- it began as a song written through a tv show but it stayed in my heart as one of the best duets in the recent years. I usually dont stan people together but I really hope that these two end up together. 

[Lee Hi: Breathe](https://youtu.be/5iSlfF8TQ9k)- Written by Jonghyun and sung by Hayi. I dont think there are many other songs that strip my feelings raw every time I hear it. 

Honorable Mention - [Jonghyun - Y Si Fuera Ella](https://youtu.be/BDb02isPFc0), I grew up listening to the [original by Alejandro Sanz](https://youtu.be/F3h26pWu3lY). It always has been one of my favorite songs. Jonghyun took the melody of the original but completely transformed the lyrics into something heartbreaking and completely unique.",72,41

Now listen to one line on one channel, and then another, you notice that it sounds worse on Stone Music and the lines are more complete on GIRLKIND's page, meaning that they say it with more passion and are saying the words with every single letter...

It's so sad that all of the groups who debuted in that year are either disbanded years ago or are left for dead by their companies no matter how successful they were. Waking up with the news of Amber leaving SM (the nail to the coffin of f(x)), it brought back the bitterness that I thought that I already overcame. As a subtle MeU back then, I wish I had the chance to see OT5 live in concert. Who seriously expected in 2011 that they (together with 2NE1, 4Minute, T-ara, After School, etc.) would suffer this fate?  But with what I have learned (and I would like to advise) as a 2nd gen fan are these: 

1.) Every kpop group is temporary no matter successful ATM they are. They will eventually disband or move on. So don't take them for granted while they can still churn out music and content for you.

2.) The energy spent on fan wars and dick measuring contests over views, sales, and awards are ridiculous and pointless and will not matter in 10 years. So save that energy on something else.  

2.) If they decide to move on from their companies, respect their decisions. At the end of the day, it's their careers and their lives, not yours. You don't know what's happening behind closed doors. 

For all 2nd gen fans out there, what would you advise new fans to save themselves from?",112,289

Oh My Girl are easily the reigning queens of aesthetic performances, heres my favorite [Closer](https://youtu.be/hRS6CAESl6c), [Secret Garden](https://youtu.be/hRS6CAESl6c), and [Fifth Season](https://youtu.be/563y0zu3X5I) performances for example, but really, every performance of theirs looks really aesthetic, not just those three.

GWSN has also impressed me with their stages, heres [Puzzle Moon](https://youtu.be/VsyzwDImzWQ), [Pinky Star](https://youtu.be/24BvLZH9F1c), and [Red Sun](https://youtu.be/zWV7d7xX-KA).

Though those two groups have rather soft songs and I dont want to imply there is only one way or a genre to do aesthetic performances. This Lizzys [Not an Easy Girl](https://youtu.be/twzLbuhplCI) performance is trot perfection, Dreamcatchers [You and I](https://youtu.be/4CMCnhaUKmQ) M! Countdown comeback is hard rock bliss, and I absolutely love the stages. 

Nor do I want to imply its a girl group thing either, I stan girl groups, so Im more familiar with them. But I dont live under a rock either, I know Vixx [Shangri-La](https://youtu.be/nQMEkXERRVA).

What about your favorites?",15,46

Anyway, long stoey short, SM started making some off the wall decisions concerning their group's concepts, music, and promotions. 

These days, I feel they are so out of touch with reality, like, the people involved in their idol division are a bunch of middle aged men who probably read books on ""how to stay hip"" and ""keeping up with teenagers"". 

This is why, when it comes to SuperM, I'm honestly pretty anxious. I may not stan EXO anymore but Baekhyun is forever my ultimate, and not only did they add him into this group, they also addes Kai, my bias wrecker. Plus added Taemin, my Shinee and male soloist bias! Then There is Taeyong and Ten... And you get the message - the group is pretty LIT. 

But SM they just.... GOT NO TASTE. (I mean, just LOOK at what they named the group??? I don't think I need to mention the whole sperm thing BUT I GON' MENTION IT ANYWAY BECAUSE WHHHHHHY.) They are so weird these days - there, I said it. And tbh, I highly doubt that weirdness will go over well in the U.S. I keep trying to comfort myself with the fact that they are in partnership with that U.S record label and that record label would likely have a say in song and album choice, but each and everytime I just can't stop thinking about the fact that they chose such a stupid name for the group and how it's bad enough that the West barely takes Asians seriously much less Kpop groups, but to add on a cringy ass name? It's clownery waiting to happen!!

I saw a rando on youtube mention how it would have been much better to name the group SupreMe instead. Like, how could some random come up with a better name than these lame ass executives!?!?

Man, I just don't want this group to sound too overproduced. 

Yeah, I know. ""Wait and see"" and all that, I assure u guys I'm not trying to make judgements before their debut, but just here to vent and see if anyone else is also feeling  anxious about this? Hopefully it turns out well, but SM gives me so little faith.",97,58

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cvcj02/nugu_roundup_8_all_idols_are_greyish_in_the_dark/). Addicted to under-the-radar groups?  Maybe you'll become a Holic-Holic.

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Debut:** March 15th, 2016 with two MVs - U Lie ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vck0nsUEmcw)) a flirtatious EDM/dance track and Our Story ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUsbLxiZMEc)) an emotional dance/pop song interspersed with footage of their trainee and pre-debut days, with some really cool dual-threat rap breaks.

**Most Recent Comeback:** August 19th, 2019 with I'm Ur Fan ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIX-NDapjvo)).  A summer trop-house song.  Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0qI9NEbiCo)).

**Other MVs and Releases:**

* Funky Dunky ([Digital Single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bh3A9iYdc)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzn3lD16aLM)) - A really fun funky retro song with some disco influence, great synths, and some very vocal lines.  The choreo is also really cool for this one, lots of great footwork and jumps.
* Hey Leader ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpMvqOd8_00)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54O3kF835MY))  Another fun one with a garage-band rock vibe combined with a middle-eastern influenced instrumental break.  The members call the curvy body-roll dance during the instrumental break the 'Cobra Dance'.

**Trivia:**  While their MVs betray a pretty low budget for the most part, and their production team seems to have some technical deficiencies, the group has some pretty cool songs, and in their dance covers they show that they're all very talented dancers, which makes since as their company has a big dance portfolio.

**Trivia:** Like Kisum last week I'm not sure how 'Nugu' she is, she's been prolific and collaborated with some big names, I have a feeling she's much more well known in the K-Indie scene than around here, but after u/eggmelon exposed me to her in the comments of last-week's roundup I knew I had to feature her this week in the hopes that I can spread the word around here - I've been completely blown away by how good everything she's put out is, and I've been listening to her all week.  Apparently she and IU have deep respect for each other and praised each other greatly after their collaboration.  She's been praised for feminist imagery in her videos and for challenging Korean cultural and beauty norms.  Her latest two releases [Stand](https://music.apple.com/us/album/stand-ep/1466017525) and [Stunning](https://music.apple.com/us/album/stunning-ep/1477291475) in particular blew me away, you should all listen to them.

**Trivia:** Various group members have a lot of experience with bigger agencies and survival/competition programs.  Member Jun trained with VIXX under Jellyfish, Donghun won an episode of I Can See Your Voice, Wow, Chan, and Kim Byeongkwan trained under JYP, and the members danced in various videos with 1Million Dance Studios prior to debut.  Jun and Chan participated in The Unit, and Donghun, Wow, and Kim Byeongchan took part in the ill-fated Mixnine competition where they did very well.  Chan was a member of The Unit's resultant group UNB.

**Tiny-G**

**Who Were They:** A four member girl group under GNG Production

**Genre:** Cute/Girl Crush

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Member Mint solo debut Already Go Lady ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRuJmtokRr8))

**Active Between:**  August 3, 2012 - 2015 (no official disbandment but all activities ceased an all members have become involved in other activities since)

**Reason for Disbanding:** Member Myungji left the group to pursue an acting career.  J.Min and Mint formed a sub-unit to promote in Thailand, and  Mint later signed with a new agency to promote as a soloist.  While the company's statement was that they were on indefinite hiatus to explore other opportunities no Tiny-G related group activities have gone on since.

**Trivia:** The group name came from the short stature of the members.  Myungji is the tallest at 5'2, J Min is 5'1, and Dohee and Mint are both 4'11'.  Their first video placed them next to tall basketball players to play on the height gimmick, and Minimanimo continued the stature visual fun trend.  Mint took part in The Unit, Myungji took part in Idol School, and Dohee performed on King of the Masked Singer.  Dohee has also taken acting roles.

Personally, I think it is the best debut song for the Produce series, and yes, I do prefer it over 'Energetic' even though I am not a big fan of EDM.

There are many instances where I immediately dislike a song because of its predictable bass/EDM drop but 'FLASH' is certainly different. I wasn't expecting such a heavy drop after the bridge and was pleasantly surprised by the different interesting synths they used.

This is just my opinion. I respect others' opinions too as I know everyone has different music tastes. I am just curious about your thoughts on this song. Do share it :)",4,0

So recently, a YouTuber named Keemstar who is known for his channel DramaAlert posted a few things on twitter about KPOP accounts. He trended the hashtag #bankpopaccounts number 1 on Twitter, on the basis that KPOP accounts are using irrelevant tags to post fancams. 

While I agree that some fans are overboard, I don't think we should ban a whole group of people because he doesn't like their content. More than that, it really seems like he did all of this for attention. We all know how powerful the KPOP community is and he used that to his advantage to try and get more relevance and views. I get that some of you might say that this isn't that big of a deal or that it was a joke but it was more than that for me.

For me, and i'm sure for a lot of you guys out there, BTS and KPOP were my escape from all my hardships in life. That is why I took it so personal and I got defensive. It annoys me when someone attacks the thing that I care about so much. And especially when they do it purely for attention!

Therefore, I ask all KPOP fans, whether you're an ARMY, EXO-L, Blink, etc..., let's come together and not let some random guy get away with attacking our whole community. Let #BANKEEMSTAR trend number 1 on Twitter!",6,0

It has been over 2 months since they have participated on schedules. There were stories going around of visa problems but that seems to be debunked as Kokoro was able to perform in her own Home Town in Japan. Linlin has been seen once in Taiwan taking a photo with a fan with chopped off hair but nothing more from the 2. 

A petition was started to make FNC give any sort of statement on the girls thats reached over 1000 signatures in a day.

172,2019-09-02,2019,9,2,14,cyky6p,KPOP Dating Bans,devilsrolldice,1567402877,"We are all familiar with how a dating scandal is unraveled in Korea, the various feelings of: betrayal, anger, backlash, ships, defamation--to name a few headlines and comments that soar in. When new groups are formed, it is common for the entertainment company to place a ban on **dating** even if it's an allotted period of time . When I first discovered kpop, I just remembered thinking how is this legal? 

Dating, and form of relationships in general, are in one's personal life.  I can't think of any type of occupation where your boss can control their employee's romantic relationships. At least, *whether you can have one or not*. Which leads to idols dating in secret: 1) To hide from the public/paparazzi. 2) To hide from their companies. I have always thought this type of limitation was an infringement on some sort of rights. 

When I've discussed this with other people their explanation we've come up with several reasons why this is done. 

1. Companies want their employees to stay focused on their careers as entertainers. (I just want to know who gave them the right, because I can't imagine a western artist, or employee anywhere in general, be told they aren't allowed to date for the sake of the company. It's always seemed more like parental authority than a workplace.) 
2. Some people in Korea genuinely feel **betrayed** by their idol dating. Unlike a western artist getting into a relationship, it is not uncommon for a K-netizen to stop being a fan all together. \[Refer to 18:58 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IocPpYt15yo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IocPpYt15yo) for reference to public reaction when Jennie and Kai's news broke.\]
3. Because of 2) a dating scandal directly affects the companies image and stocks.  

It is mainly the cultural difference here. It's just different in Korea, too many fans are almost possessive of their idols. And, when and if, a scandal breaks the company suffers.  Which means they attempt deflect this issue all together with *dating bans.*",18,0

![video](uvepzbcaq6k31)

Translation:

""

1.Seulgi looks like she'll never lie.

a. I despise lying. I despise it but I believe white lies are needed sometimes.

2. Yeri looks like she screamed when she saw Ariana Grande had followed her

a. I did scream a lot.

3. As Seulgi prepares to go out, she looks like she'll take an hour to get ready.

a. I don't really care about it that much. I do the basics but I don't spend a lot of time going into details.

4. Yeri looks like she'll look herself up on Naver or Twitter

a. I do. I look through it when I want to see something or look for a picture of myself. Maybe I want to see photos of myself with makeup on?

5. If Seulgi sees injustice, she looks like she won't be able to contain herself.

a. It does bother me. I have this personality where if I'm able to be of help, I want to help out. I was like this since I was a child. I will not be able to contain myself. I think I'll them, ""What are you doing!?'

6. Yeri looks like she'll be able to buy a building using her copyright paycheck in 10 years.

a. I did release a self composed song but I didn't get that much money. I'm gonna work harder to release a song that'll give me a lot of money.

7. Seulgi looks like she'll dance alone in her room.

a. I don't dance. I like to spend my days quietly.

8. Yeri looks like she has over 1000 friends.

a. I don't have that many friends. I usually just hang out with the people I always hang out with.

9. Seulgi looks like she'll have her own drinking habits.

a. People around me tell me I act cute. They tell me I keep doing this (points her finger to her head). I get more hyped up than I normally do. I start to use hand gestures. So its like I am able to express myself more.

10. \[This sentence is a word play on their names\] Seulgi looks like she'll be wise and Yeri will be keen.

a. I think Seulgi unnie is wise. You see I suck with technology, I can't even fix my computer. I received a heating pad and I couldn't even set that up. As I was struggling, Seulgi unnie always comes to help me out. When I'm next to her and look at her, I think she's so admirable and so wise. Also, for the Yeri part of the question, I don't think I'm that keen.... Or am I? I'm not that keen right? I don't think I'm keen.

Some think they are essentially the same genre of music just in another language, I think that though they are both pop genres, they are unique to the type of pop that is presented. 

I think that when a Kpop artist releases songs in Japanese, it musically is still Kpop style and not much like Jpop music. Only artist I know that does make unique songs to the genre is BoA and DBSK, I'm sure there are others though.

I think the song was called Godzillas. It seemed like a group, it might have been the cohort? anyways, I have been looking for the song again and again, and I can't find it anywhere in my history or on Spotify. I'm almost positive I listen to it on Spotify at least once, and I viewed it in Reddit from YouTube. Whatever since I haven't been able to find it at all. Maybe they took the video down, the term godzillas is a really popular search term for the obvious reasons, but I love the song and one of the rappers and particular who seem like kind of a nerdcore guy was really intriguing to me.

It was a proper video, not just an album cover or scrolling lyrics with the music playing over. it might have been Jay all day Keith Ape and some other guys. But there was one guy that I'm really trying to find in there, I saw him in another clip where he was rapping with a guy in a bookstore and black and white. I heard he was blowing up. But I left it and now that I'm coming back to try to pick it up again I can't find any of it. Does anybody have any idea who I might be looking for?",2,0

I am born in early 90s,but i am not the kind of person to actually know other countries issues,but am trying to understand how these will affect Chinese Idols in Korea.

We recently had news of Amber leaving F(x).Could her decision is related to this issue?

What if they don't support neither side?Would migrating be an option for them?Will they be called a traitor if they chose to migrates?

I understand China power,but do they have to disturb Hong Kong &amp; even Taiwanese seem affected.

NK &amp; SK has already made a peace,so i hope more countries made peace.

By doing this,they are affecting everyone,even the half bred.

As a fans,should we be concern?

Should korean companies stop taking in China trainees for now as well as the future?",38,7

She told me Bts have a lot of mistakes in the past but she said they have own up to it and change their ways but in these past few years when Bts started to blew up one of the big scandals they were involve is the bomb thing of Jimin shirt apparently a basher started it but she said the whole thing wouldnt even happened if Jimin didnt wore it and should been careful as theres no way Jimin a korean doesnt know what happened his country and japan. She also told me about the current one which is the paris thing with jimin, the boy deserve a vacation and do what he want but he should been more careful as a lot of eyes are watching them since theyre big thing now. Jimin going to the club/pub drinking playing with the girls and stuff reminds her with Bigbang days where the boys are just simply partying back then but look at them now. Shes scared that Jimin will just ruin the group since all this scandals started from him even tho she know deep inside he isnt that kind of person she still scared as who knows what might happen in the future.",0,1

(week 54),ThisGuyKpops,1567519520," Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So no live, remix, or free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

P.S: I finished my 5th video on [Top Visual K Pop](https://youtu.be/_hejMlDm9xY).  Definitely getting better with the skillset = D

Check back on thursday for update!",18,19

Some of my favorite background vocals(i linked to timestamps for some):

SHINee- [Jojo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA8RBuQM_sI&amp;t=2m25s) -Jonghyun's beautiful high notes in the bridge, [Prism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgue5SvRvDg)- bg vocals and complex production that are a bop on its own

TWICE- [Signal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3snzatdaA&amp;t=0m38s) - deep voice vocals 0:38-1:15 from I believe-Jeongyeon/Jihyo? I like the bg vocal version more than the original song lol it slaps!

Like people to this day claim Hyuna sings in Lips and Hips but oh my I just can't help but imagine Seunghee of CLC singing that part. I can recognise that lowered larynx any part of the day. It's so obviously her it's unbelievable that people still claim it's Hyuna when Hyuna has never showed the ability to use a non nasal chest dominant mix or lower her larynx(which is a good thing because lowering the larynx is damaging but still).

Another example is Apink. I just hear Eunji's voice throughout Mr.Chu's chorus. Eunji is a full lyric soprano so she has a darker tone. Bomi is by all means a light lyric soprano. And in the chorus the only one I can hear is Eunji as Bomi's voice is nowhere near the same as Eunji's.

For you, what is the one core part that shines the most to you about your favorite groups? That is, despite however many other strengths this group may have, or any weaknesses, this particular aspect is what impresses you the most/makes you the most proud to be a fan.

My roommate is a Moomoo. As we all know, Mamamoo are undeniably vocal queens. But while that is a huge part of why my roommate loves them, what actually makes her the most proud to be a Moomoo is Mamamoo's image and how they portray themselves. Especially in recent years they have begun to establish themselves less as an idol group and more as artists, and they straightforwardly discuss their own ideals and opinions without shame or fear of backlash despite societal standards. This is what inspires my roommate and lets her talk freely and proudly about her ult group to other people, even when kpop as a topic in general can be embarrassing to bring up.

In my case, what I like the most about IZ\*ONE is their earnestness and how that contributes to their audience engagement. I have no doubt that as a team they're neither the best singers nor dancers, but it seems they're aware of it too, and so when they perform there's a tangible sense of their dedication and determination to both enjoy their stages and for the audience to enjoy it too. This doesn't even just apply to their performances, but also such engagements like fansigns and hi-touches. They're clearly still developing as performers, and that's fun too, but already I find that such things like their interpersonal sense, their ability to communicate and engage with audiences to the utmost, are very impressive for a group their age and the amount of experience some members have. 

I'm curious to know about everyone else! What do you like the most about your favorite groups? What makes you the most proud to call yourself a fan? Feel free to mention multiple groups if you have many!",64,83

For me this would be: 

BTS - Sings a hip-hop version of Do You Really Want To Hurt Me by Culture Club. The signature line of Do you really want to hurt me, do you really want to make me cryyyy... is sung by Jimin with his falsetto and V using his deep voice.

Exo - Sings a sultry, jazzed up version of Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-a-lot. Their choreo looks suspiciously similar to Artificial Love. The line of ...my anaconda dont want none unless you got buns hun... is sung by Sehun. 

Mamamoo - Sings Im Too Sexy by Right Said Fred. They arrange it in a mixture of Piano Man and Mr. Ambiguous. This is less cringiest version since Mamamoo can sing the phone book and is truly too sexy for their cat.",38,67

if you guys know korean, like fluently, I need you guys to help me write an email to BTSs or BigHits email address (I dont need a reply, I just need to send one) for my A-Level Media Studies course. 
We have to make a music video and the original song choice I chose wasnt approved by the exam board, so Ive had to pick a new one. With my video idea, Mikrokosmos is perfect as the lyrics match exactly as I need it. 
But, as part of the course, we have to send an email to the artist or the production company asking permission of use for their song. Doesnt really matter if we dont get one back, we just have to have evidence of sending it. 

SO,,
You get the gist. Anybody help me out?",2,1

As for an explanation for its removal. It hasn't immediately caught my attention at first, but the reason is likely related to the merging of [Sony America's music recording and publishing divisions:](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sonys-music-recording-and-music-publishing-companies-are-now-one-860134/) Sony Music Entertainment and Sony/ATV Publishing as Sony Music Group to be consistent with how Universal &amp; Warner Music Groups operate.

The merger occurred on August 1, the same day as the removal of these albums from international streaming (outside of Korea and Japan). If this is truly the reason for the removal, I have no idea how these few specific K-Pop albums from a small agency are the ones that got caught up in the reorganization. [However as a result, these previously Kakao M releases are now suddenly distributed by **Sony Music Entertainment**.](https://i.imgur.com/TZrMaAJ.jpg) [(Melon)](https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=10126977) As far as I'm aware though, B1A4 &amp; OH MY GIRL (not ONF) are still partners with Kakao M for future releases. This distribution change has more major effects as well. As these recordings are now owned(?) or at least enforced by an American music company, their Content ID policies are a lot more strict. This has unfortunately led to a large number of fancams featuring songs in these albums to become flagged and are now unwatchable worldwide.",27,290

That being said, their recent release ""Adios"" contains several words and/or phrases that on first listen, I could not tell were actually French and Spanish. 

There is a line in the song that goes:

""Goodbye, Au Revoir, Adios"".

However, when I first heard it (and still do to a degree even after knowing what is being said and playing it for a non-K-Pop fan who agrees)....it sounds more like -

""**Goodbye, Ah-Vwa-Dios**""

Another song that's like that for me is Ikon's ""Scenario"". To this day, whenever I hear that song I don't hear the word ""scenario"", I hear -

""**SEN-ah-REE-OH**""

It just made me curious if folks had other examples of non-Korean words used in K-Pop lyrics that went unrecognized by listeners.",66,32

this has been plaguing me for a looooong time.
I've been into Kpop for a while but I know for sure that this happened before 2014, if that helps.
I remember watching a music video, by a solo male artist i'm pretty sure, and for the life of me cannot find it!
all i remember us him singing the lyrics ""oppa, oppa"" a lot 
and the music video was about a crazy fan girl i believe.  she was in this run down house, and had a lot of posters of the singer on her walls.  and she was basically just going crazy and screaming at the posters fangirling, and at some point the singer is tied up in the house? so i'm not sure if she abducted him or not, because at the end it made it seem like a fever dream. since he was freed from his bunds and like lying down in a pose? winking at her or something too.
please let me know if you know what I am talking about! this has been plaguing me for a while and i could never find it 
thanks!!",2,0

I saw this tweet that theyre the next bigbang and I cant help to think that theyre somewhat right, before someone attack me Im not saying they would also go through the same mess Bb has now what I mean is some of the members of Bb also likes clubbing before and because of that they were caught in some rumours/scandals since theres a lot of eyes watching them and Bts is in the same situation now. I also saw this tweet from an army saying that its probably the first time Jimin goes to the club but hopefully it will be the last time because if he continues to act like this since theyre big now one wrong move could ruin their career especially media likes to create false drama and the Op was afraid that it doesnt matter whether it will be true or not since it could still ruin their name. Which also leads me to think that isnt he also the reason the whole mess about bomb shirt issue about Kor and Japan? I dont know what exactly happened but my army friend once told me that Jimin was wearing a controversial shirt and at the end Bts or their company donated/apologised to the victims(?) of what happened to Kor&amp;Japan but he is a korean himself but why didnt he took a consideration wearing that shirt if its really that controversial? Which also leads me to my conclusion that Bts had also been quite problematic in the past but seeing the army on twt they would always say theyve already apologised and grown which is good but lately isnt Jimin is the one creating all these mess lately and not to mention the bomb shirt really was the big one, from what I remember the whole group was dragged. Not to be that person but if I were him I also would like to do whatever I want and be happy but Ill also be careful since Im not only dragging my name but my whole group.",3,0

Secondly, lets get to the main point of this discussion. So Ive been listening to kpop for years now. What really drew me into kpop was that almost every single song had a dance to it. So I started listening to kpop with the ambition that I was going to learn how to dance. Boy was I mistaken. That was 8 years ago and I still havent even gave it the slightest try. Though now its finally time for me to actually do what I tell myself I wanna do.

But for me, every dance seems either really easy so I try and realize my mistake or I think the dances look really hard I dont bother to try them out. I have some experience to dancing in the way I had to dance really simple choreographies almost a decade ago. However I do feel like I got a sense of rythm due to the fact Ive played a few instruments in my life, the violin for more than a decade. 

Im aware there are people here who are way more experienced with this than I am, so Im here to both get some advice on how to pull this through and where i should start at. Please help me :D",5,8

Another Plagiarism Issue for the Group?,melting_kpopsicle,1567640090,"I posted this on allkpop, but since I don't really ever post there I didn't know how their post structure worked and the wait time. My friend told me about this subreddit and suggested I post this here. It's a bit controversial but I thought it was interesting and wanted to hear other people's viewpoints on the matter.

Weekly Idol has released a video of a dance battle between Weki Meki and EVERGLOW. However one commenter noticed a large number of moves from EVERGLOW'S dance to the song River have been taken from Galen Hook's original choreography to the same song. The original comment on the youtube video seems to have been deleted, but people were arguing that it was alright and should be taken as a dance cover. However another person mentioned how half the moves were changed and no credit was given to Galen, as through they were trying to pass it off as their own work. 

EVERGLOW'S River choreography starts at 1:26:

vs. 

[Galen Hook's choreography to River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pHYxx9dY_U)

&amp;#x200B;

This comes after plagiarism claims against EVERGLOW about their new song Adios copying from a combination of AronChupa's I'm an Albatraoz (the melody/chorus) and Blackpink's Kill This Love (the song structure/rap styles and dance moves), as discussed in this video:

[EVERGLOW Adios Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ApHBtzTcCg)

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, there were also accusations that their debut song, Bon Bon Chocolat copyied two of Ariana Grande's songs. Video below:

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think? Do you see the similarities between the two choreographies to River? Since they changed some moves, is it technically ""alright"" they took the choreography since they didn't copy it move for move?  

Personally I'm not sure I find it ok. On one hand we don't know if they perhaps took the proper channels and obtained permission from Galen or paid her accordingly for her work, or if they just decided to copy the dance and but change parts so that it technically isn't an exact copy. I know choreography copyright laws are complicated and different than music, but if the latter is the case, I find it similar to a rapper in a rap battle using multiples lines from someone else's rap and passing it off as their own.

 I also thought this would be an interesting discussion, given all the legal battles in recent years between actual kpop artists and their companies not crediting them for their own work that they do on their songs.

Is it worrying that there is a trend in EVERGLOW'S work where listeners and viewers are finding it too similar/almost copies of other artists' work over and over? Does changing some moves/notes/arrangement of things make it ok and not a plagiarism issue? What are your thoughts?

Let's also remember, that the groups have to do what their companies tell them to, so while the girls are the one's dancing and singing, it's the company who decides to do these things, not the girls.",0,1

I've only quite recently (and regretfully) gotten into kpop and korean culture, and I've always kinda liked to dance and sing, which was what nurtured my interest for korean music.

So I've been following a lot of different agencies and have even thought of auditioning to become a trainee myself  and I was curious as to what the selection process for auditioning people are, and if the standards are consistent/similar for most agencies. I'm also quite curious as to what agencies would be best for me if I wanted to pursue such a career. I've done a bit of my own research and considering the current events surrounding the Burning Sun scandal, I think it would be best for me avoid YG. Other than that, agencies such as JYP, and Fantagio seem to treat their employees very well, whereas agencies such as SM and Cube focus on skills. 

Also, I was quite curious as to what the selection process for trainees within their respective agencies would be to debut in a group. Is there a specific criteria that the trainees must reach, and if so, how do agencies know when a trainee has reached that stage.",1,1

Quick disclaimer: category names vary from show to show. For example, for the SMAs the SOTY equivalent is actually called Record of the Year in Digital Release and Artist of the Year is just Daesang. I used the same category names throughout this whole thing for the sake of simplicity.

As a bonus I also added any awards won by idols at the Korean Music Awards

Please do point out any mistakes you find!

And sorry for the awkward wording, English isn't my first language lol

Of course I dont think SM its a perfect company, but it seems that they give anyone a single or whatever.

If you think about It coldly, why wouldnt they want to give f(x), one of their best groups, a comeback if that will give them money?

Since 4 Walls, that was their last work, I think Luna and Amber have around 5 digital singles, and Luna a mini album, they also give Sulli a single, I know that shes not in fx anymore but what Im trying to say Is that how do ppl know they wanted to make a comeback and SM said no.

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

678,2019-09-06,2019,9,6,7,d07v7f,s#arp - the amazing 1st gen group you probably haven't heard of,krystalshairinnuabo,1567722364,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;S#arp was one of the few mixed-gender groups active during an era when single-gender groups such as [S.E.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.E.S._(band)), [Fin.K.L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin.K.L), [Shinhwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinhwa) and [g.o.d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.o.d) were dominating the music scene. The group has won #1 on the [music programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_programs_of_South_Korea) [*Inkigayo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkigayo) and [*Music Bank*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Bank_(TV_series)), tasting their first success in 1999 with ""Tell Me Tell Me"".

Their visuals and music have both held up, look at this, it could have been released in 2019:

It's elimination round this week and the Top 35 have moved on to this round. Head over to the [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/kpoproduce-2) to find out the rankings!

Due to the eliminations, there are going to be some restructuring in teams that have more or less than 7 members. ""Open Up"" team has exactly 7 members left so there are no changes. ""Showtime"" and ""Oh Little Girl"" team has 9 and 8 members respectively so they will need to eliminate members. Using [Random.org](https://Random.org), Bomin &amp; Hwanwoong has been removed from ""Showtime"" and Seungmin has been removed from ""Oh Little Girl"". 

These are the updated members of each team now.

* Yohan (TST)
* Younghoon (The Boyz)

For this round, you will be voting just once for ONE person from the 35 male idols in the Concept ""Evaluation"" round. The team with the highest total votes will get benefit votes. The person with the most votes in that team will get an additional 50 votes. The rest of the members will get additional 20 votes. Head [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdirKKBi5WOnvTWo7lCIsjV0E_AKWzbUUK0IjrixanZc5HqVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to vote!

As usual, you will get to vote up to SEVEN times for the weekly voting. Take note, you can only vote for TWO male idols instead of eleven. Let's see how will that shake up the rankings. There will be only 2 weeks of weekly voting and the concept ""evaluation"" round before the eliminations takes place. The Top 20 will be moving on to the finale.

Was it worth it? *Absolutely.* Despite the technical issues that affected the first half of the show, The Rose absolutely owned their NYC concert. I saw them on tour last May, and they have grown so much in those 16 months.

If you ever a get a chance to see The Rose live, please do ([their US Tour is still ongoing!](https://www.mymusictaste.com/artist/%EB%8D%94%EB%A1%9C%EC%A6%88-The-Rose,dea692689780578193653ed0b33e097b/)). They are such fantastic performers. The concert was so much fun and probably one of the most chill shows I've been to. Not to say the crowd was quiet - the crowd was INSANE (me included lol). The Rose seemed genuinely shocked at how loud we were, and how much of the songs we sang along to. Woosung took out his in ears for most of the show (more background below) and at some point he was like, ""it feels like i'm singing with you guys and I love it"".  They are all so comfortable on stage and in interacting with fans - whether it was giving a little fan service, cracking jokes, breaking into impromptu song/freestyle during transitions, or just making conversation. 

# Rose Garden Event

Aside from the concert, I bought the Rose Garden special package (if I'm going to go, might as well go all out?). The Rose Garden event happened a few hours before the concert. It consisted of a Q&amp;A, signing session and photo with the group. This was my third time doing one of the MMT special events (KNK and SF9 previously) and the Q&amp;A session for The Rose was by far the best.  They had the members take turns reading each question + the name of the person who submitted it (so it was like a roll call too haha). It wasn't rushed at all, and the members really took their time to answer each question. There was lots of joking around and off tangent stories. Jaehyeong and Hajoon were so much more confident in their English this tour. Their English is so good, I was seriously amazed! Also, hearing Woosung read out my full name...didn't know that was something I needed.

For the signing, I brought this fashion llama art print I had been meaning to hang up. I thought it could use a little extra, and The Rose's signatures (+ little decorations) were the perfect touch. I got super tongue tied during the signing and probably looked like an idiot, but they were all super sweet! And SO handsome (Hajoon really owns his silver hair). For my group photo, I had us all do a bunny ear pose! It turned out way better than I expected, and as bonus, Woosung gave me an extra bunny ear.

# Concert

**Seating:** The show was unreserved seating for all ticket tiers. I ended up in the 4th row of the middle-right section, so I was right between Woosung and Dojoon on stage. 

**Member Observations**

* **Woosung:** Woosung's charisma/stage presence...man, it is unbelievable.  The way he carries himself on stage - he is just so relaxed and commands your attention. I will never get tired of listening to him sing or watching him live his best life on stage. 
* **Dojoon:** My handsome keyboardist/guitar player/main vocalist...not going to lie, seeing his big ass smile while performing made me a little weak. He is SUCH a charmer and so talented to boot. His Hold Back The River cover...I could listen to it 24/7.
* **Hajoon:** I have to say, stanning drummers (Dowoon is my Day6 bias too) is HARD since they aren't always as visible. I always end up getting blocked by the mic/cymbals, but from what I could see of him, Hajoon was still A+++. He pours so much energy/passion into each performance, and you can tell how happy he is. We did get to see him up front and center with his duet with Jaehyeong, and that was so beautiful. Hajoon's vocals are so so so sweet. 
* **Jaehyeong:** Jaehyeong may have been on the opposite end of the stage from me, but he still caught my attention. He has so much fun performing, and he was constantly interacting with the crowd and making jokes. His confidence and his smile are DAZZLING. (Side note of fangirling: watching him soundcheck was VERY attractive)

**The Show**

The start of the show: Lights dimmed, The Rose came out on stage and the crowd went wild. They played their intro, going into I.L.Y. and Woosung started singing...only for no sound to come out. Cue lots of confusion. While they were trying to fix Woosung's mic, Dojoon realized his keyboard also had no sound, and there were various issues with in ear levels. Kudos to The Rose - they took it all in stride, running through their adjustments while also interacting with the fans. Jaehyeong and Dojoon especially were constantly making jokes/cheering up the crowd during sound checks. After they finished, they restarted the show with Dojoon jokingly going, ""Pretend like we just came out"". 

They started off with some slower songs (**I.L.Y.** and **Insomnia**), and it was such a great way to warm up the crowd. (I swear, Woosung and Dojoon looked at me during the chorus of I.L.Y, and I almost died right there). Hajoon absolutely rocked his drum solos during the bridges. At some point, Woosung ended up taking out his in ears, warning us that he might suck at singing since he couldn't hear himself (spoiler: he was perfect. Absolutely perfect). The pace picked up a bit with **I Don't Know You,** before they moved to my favorite song - **Candy**. The energy of Candy was so infectious. It is SUCH a feel good song.  Jaehyeong and Woosung jamming out together during the bridge was absolutely adorable. The next song was **Beautiful Girl.** Woosung was so playful, and we got the return of rapper Dojoon. 100/10. Next was **Like We Used To**, followed by **California.** I was really looking forward to seeing California live, and it didn't disappoint (Bonus for it being all in English, so I could scream along with confidence). They moved into **She's In The Rain**, which always gives me goosebumps. Woosung's vulnerable, emotive (?) vocals really make this song. 

The next part of the show was covers central! They started off with their classic **Breakeven** (The Script) cover. Woosung asked the crowd to sing along if they knew the lyrics, but they were not prepared for how loud the crowd was haha. The look on his face and Dojoon going ""Oh my god Black Roses"" while the crowd sang the first verse was priceless. The rest of their group covers were: **Sign Of The Times** (Harry Styles)**, ILYSB** (LANY), and **Home** (Park Hyo Shin)**.** I loved the ILYSB cover on Super Band, and it was even more amazing seeing the whole group perform it live.  The next performance was **Greed** (which I believe is still an unreleased song?), which Dojoon absolutely owned. 

After Greed, they moved into solo/duet performances. Dojoon started off with **Hold Back The River** (James Bay). He has such a wonderfully rich and full voice that worked well with this song. His vocals + smile? Double kill. Jaehyeong and Hajoon covered **Solder** (Before your exit) - the cheers for them were ENORMOUS. They have such angelic vocals, and there's nothing Black Roses love more than seeing them showcase them. Woosung ended off the section by performing his solo songs **Lonely** and **Face**. Like I mentioned before, his stage presence is fantastic. Lonely and Face are two very different songs, but he embodied the emotion of each song so well. Lonely was  lowkey and intimate, while Face was upbeat and flirty.  

The last part of the show started with the members parodying Woosung's Face performance while he was getting changed LOL.  Once he came back on stage, they performed two unreleased songs -  **I Can't Let You Go** and **Photographer (**Jaehyeong and Hajoon starting off I Can't Let You Go...yesssss). The rest of the show consisted of **O.M.G.**, **Baby**, **Sorry**, **Take Me Down**. The last song of the night was their newest title, **RED**. RED was the perfect song to end the show, and watching them take in the crowd one last time  made the whole performance even more special. 

My ears were dead by the end of the show, but it was all worth it. [Please check out The Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8LG-_HGd4)!",11,19

On July 13th I was eating at a Korean restaurant and they were playing a bunch of kpop. Recent stuff, like bts latest album and birthday by somi.. so to give you a time frame, im thinking it was a recent song. 

Anyways this cute song played, it was kinda pop but kinda indie. All I remember is a cute girl, woth maybe like really light blonde or bleached hair, with like angel wings or cupid wings on. And that's all i remember. 

Anyways if anyone has a idea, thanks!",3,1

During my summer computer science course we were tasked with creating a website of our choice. Being the fan of this sub and just for music in general I was inspired to create a mega forum where there was individual communities for every artist and album. In addition to having individual boards, there are also a categorical pages for general discussion and artists have discography pages to allow for quicker navigation and discovery of new music. I'm looking to expand the data via crowdsourcing and various apis but for now I thought of keeping things simple. Literally just launched a few days ago so the community is still small. For anyone that digs the concept, I encourage you to join and leave feedback where needed. See you there:

Or maybe each episode could be like a syllabus/greatest hits thing where they go through the best that each group has done on stage, on various albums, behind the scenes; stuff like that. Maybe give out awards to members for different things, like Most Fashionable; Best Dancer; stuff like that? idk, I love that kind of thing!
  
Also.... I know it would be too controversial but as a huge multi I would love to listen to a debate style podcast where two hosts compare similar groups and go back and forth about who has better discography, MVs, performances, styling, variety show appearances, etc etc. and then land on a winner at the end. People may complain too much but I love basically every group out there and I would love to hear two people trying to figure out who is better at what kinds of things.

They were doing their retirement show and I was going to be a part of it. I knew the choreography and everything lol

Here we are, folks! The Charts &amp; Achievements Comeback!

This issue is one of our biggest challenges as a subreddit. Over the years and across multiple mod teams, different methods have been attempted to deal with this. [I covered the recent problems and changes from the end of 2018 into this year in the comments of the June Town Hall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bvzon0/town_hall_june_2019/epts30e/?st=jyz49vic&amp;sh=5ee3b9e9) You can read over that to understand the difficulty of inconsistency and finding the right middle-ground with what kinds of posts are allowed and which are not.

A 2nd, more granular, poll for achievements is still being considered, but this post is necessary for organization and to get feedback before we can even think about forming one. More than that, it's very possible we can agree to a bunch of reasonable rules and achievements to implement through this discussion without needing to poll for them at all.

The goal with this discussion is to lay everything out in the sunshine so we see what we're dealing with. We want to take an inventory of all the possibilities, so the theme here is going to be 'excessively thorough'.

**If this looks overwhelming (understandable!), please focus on the All-Time Records section and help us with some feedback there. That's the part we would love to set into rules as soon as possible. In the comments you will find categories with frameworks to help you give us the critical feedback we're looking for.** 

**THIS IS A LONG-TERM DISCUSSION, so don't feel pressured to reply immediately! You can take your time to be thorough. We'd like to set All-Time Records rules in the October Town Hall, but suggestions will continue to be welcome here!**

There are a few methods of handling Achievements in r/kpop:

We could have a free-for-all where anything goes. We could have absolutely no achievements  (possibly with a dedicated subreddit that would be a free-for-all purely for achievements). We could allow only all-time records and nothing else. We could allow all-time records and include a few specific ones that are more common.

The All or Nothing methods seem to be equally unpopular, so we need to figure out a compromise. Everything below this point is a necessary effort to navigate this middle-ground, which seems to be what most users want. So let's explore everything that could entail, shall we?

**NOTE: We will be creating an `[Achievement]` flair and a filter regardless of anything else that happens here. Some users have asked us to allow a free-for-all with a flair/filter system, but keep in mind that only a fraction of users will be able to make use of the filter depending on what platform they use to browse reddit, so it is not ideal as a means to manage a free-for-all for most users.**

&amp;nbsp;

***

## ALL-TIME RECORDS

There are two optional methods here:

**1\. Free-for-all:** Anything that resembles an all-time record would be allowed. (Highest ever, most ever, longest ever, etc.)

**2\. Set reasonable limitations** that serve the best interests of the subreddit while still being manageable to moderate with as much consistency as possible.

**x\. Nothing:** We are removing this as an option. It is clearly unpopular and is not reasonable for a subreddit that supports K-pop news content.

**Important!** Many of the records here can potentially be split into even more records beyond the top-most: Female Group, Male Group, Female soloist, Male soloist, Sub-unit, Collaboration, Collaboration with global artist, etc. For example, there might be a boy group that has the greatest selling album of all time, but the greatest selling album of all time for a *girl group* is also a possible all-time record even if it is a smaller number than the top-most. Please consider whether these more specific records should be allowed or only the top-most earners.

&amp;nbsp;

### POSSIBLE RECORDS

*1\. Sales, views, charting, pre-orders*

* Greatest selling album of all time
* Greatest cumulative album sales for an artist 
* Most viewed MV
* Most cumulative MV views for an artist (YouTube)
* Most charted #1s for an artist
* Longest continuously charting song
* Greatest pre-orders for an album
* Greatest sales/pre-orders for an album within a time-frame (week, month)
* Greatest sales/pre-orders as a foreign artist (ie. in Japan)

*2\. Music shows*

* Most music show wins for one song
* Most music show wins for one song specific to each station (SBS, Mnet, MBC, etc)
* Most cumulative music show wins for an artist
* Fastest to a music show win after debut for an artist
* Longest time (days) to a music show win after debut for an artist
* Highest number of music show grand slams

*3\. Ticket sales, Touring, Box-office*

* Highest revenue for a single tour
* Highest revenue for a single tour venue
* Highest cumulative tour revenue for an artist
* Highest box-office earnings for a K-pop related movie
* More?

## GENERAL ACHIEVEMENTS

We could also have All or Nothing options here. However, based on the feedback from users over time, All is pretty easy to dismiss and Nothing would get rid of some achievements that, while more common, are still enjoyed by many of you.

This section, or parts of it, are more likely to be turned into a poll if needed. Many of these were able to be set nicely back in the May 2019 poll. If we did have a 2nd poll, every single option would have a yes/no dichotomy (along with a yes/no on achievements overall). Nothing would be stacked with anything else to avoid fiddling with complicated percentages in the results.

In that poll earlier in the year we had absolutely clear results on the following: We removed CAKs, streaming records, brand reputation rankings, and social media subscriber/follower counts. We approved physical sales, GaOn Triple Crowns, Certifications, and PAKs. But our options for MV view milestones and pre-orders were too stacked to be conclusive.

&amp;nbsp;

### MV VIEWS

We've had some great feedback in recent Town Halls regarding how enormous these numbers are getting. So we have some options for more reasonable increments. The options listed here are specific, but generally what we should determine is (A) what do we want the lowest/first milestone number to be? (B) What should the millions increments be? (C) What should the billions increments be? (D) Should there be a cap at the top? If so, what number should that be?

Options for increments (These would be ONLY the first time hitting each milestone for an artist):

  * Every 100 million to infinity (Current rules)
  * Every 100 million up to 1billion and then, 2bil, 3bil, 4bil...
  * 100mil, 200mil, 300mil, 400mil, 500mil, 1bil, 1.5bil, 2bil, 3bil, 4bil...
  * 50mil, 100mil, 200mil, 300mil, 400mil, 500mil, 1bil, 1.5bil, 2bil, 3bil, 4bil... (same as above with 50mil)
  * 50mil, 100mil, 200mil, 300mil, 400mil, 500mil, 1bil, 1.5bil, 2bil, 2.5, 3bil, 3.5bil, 4bil... (same as above with half-billions)
  * 100mil, 500mil, 1bil, 2bil, 3bil, 4bil...
  * 100mil, 500mil, 1bil (nothing past 1bil)
  * 50mil, 100mil, 500mil, 1bil (nothing past 1bil)
  * 1mil, 10mil, 25mil, 50mil, 100mil, then every 100mil up until a billion, 1bil, 1.5bil, 2bil, 2.5bil, 3bil...
  * Every time an MV gets 1000% more views than it previously had: 1mil, 10mil, 100mil, 1bil, and then every other billion
  * Suggestions?

Reviewing our current rules and considering more/less options for views:

* Most views in 24 hours (Current rules)
* Fastest to 100 million views (Current rules)
* Trending #1 on YouTube (in various countries/regions?)
* Record number of videos above certain milestones (eg. Most MVs over 100 mil views?)
* Suggestions?

&amp;nbsp;

### PRE-ORDERS

Users confirmed in the May 2019 poll they wanted posts for physical sales records and seemed in favor of pre-orders as well. We have applied the same 'personal record model' and increments used for physical sales milestones to pre-orders, too: 

Options for increments (These would be ONLY the first time hitting each milestone for an artist):

* 25k, 50k, 100k, 250k, 500k, 1mil, 2mil, 3mil... (Current rules)
* 50k, 100k, 500k, 1mil, 2mil, 3mil...
* Suggestions?

&amp;nbsp;

### PHYSICAL SALES

* 25k, 50k, 100k, 250k, 500k, 1mil, 2mil, 3mil... (Current rules)
* 50k, 100k, 500k, 1mil, 2mil, 3mil... 
* Suggestions?
* What kind of sales reporting should be allowed for GaOn?

For both sales and pre-orders, consider if we should allow milestones outside of South Korea (eg. in Japan or the US). If we did, would the same increments apply or should they be more restricted?

&amp;nbsp;

### CERTIFICATIONS

While we affirmed certifications as allowed from the May poll, users have given good feedback over time about allowed certifications being strangely selective. We'd love to hear suggestions for a set of certs that makes sense for the subreddit or if we should allow them across the board.

* Here are the top 10 music markets:
  * USA (RIAA)
  * Japan (RIAJ)
  * Germany (BVMI)
  * UK (BPI)
  * France (SNEP)
  * South Korea (GaOn)
  * Canada (Music Canada)
  * Australia (ARIA)
  * Brazil (ABPD)
  * China (State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television)

Reviewing our current rules and considering more/less options for certifications:

* RIAA, RIAJ, ARIA, BPI (Current rules)
* All Certifications in any market (Silver in the UK, Gold, Platinum, Diamond)
* RIAA, RIAJ
* RIAA, RIAJ, BVMI, BPI, SNEP
* A different set?
* Should certifications be first time only for an artist? First time only per song? No restriction?
* Eligibility (this is different than actually being certified. Should we allow posts that are announcing eligibility alone?)

&amp;nbsp;

### CHARTS

The same selectivity issue applies to charts. We could use a lot of help here from anyone more familiar with charting considerations. Almost none of the mods have much personal interest or knowledge in this area.

* Music charts :
  * USA (Billboard) - Hot 100, 200
  * Japan (Oricon) - Hot 100, Oricon Half-year, Oricon full-year
  * UK (Album Chart, Singles Chart)
  * ARIA (Albums Chart, Singles Chart)
  * UHC [\(United World Chart\)](http://www.mediatraffic.de/about-us.htm)
  * [IFPI](https://www.ifpi.org/bestsellers-and-global-artist.php)

Reviewing our current rules and considering more/less options for charts:

* New peaks or #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200, UK Singles Chart, UK Album Chart, ARIA Singles Chart, ARIA Albums Chart, Oricon half-year, Oricon full-year (Current Rules)

* Should the charts we allow coincide with the certifications we allow?

* Perfect All-Kills (Approved in May poll)

* GaOn Triple Crowns (Approved in May poll)

* 'Artist's song has reached #1 in X amount of countries'

* iTunes anything?
  * Most #1s on iTunes in various countries
  * Taking up multiple top spots on US iTunes
  * Non-US iTunes stats
* Streaming anything?
  * Spotify records?
  * Apple Music records?

* Suggestions?

&amp;nbsp;

### MUSIC SHOWS

* The first win on a music show for each song (Current rules)
* Grand slams (winning on all shows)
* Suggestions?

&amp;nbsp;

### GENERAL AWARDS

* Other awards given to artists, songs, or companies such as ""Rookie of the Year"", ""Song of the Year"", Award Nominations, etc. (Current rules)
* Popularity polls on media sites (eg. MTV)
* Guinness Records
* Presidential Awards/recognition (politically-related)

&amp;nbsp;

### TOURING

* Ticket sales
* Ticket sales per venue
* Speed of selling out tickets
* Breaking personal records per artist

Should all touring/ticketing records be kept in Tour Review Round-Up posts?

&amp;nbsp;

## LAST NOTES FOR FUTURE DECISIONS

Almost certainly there will come a time when some new phenomenal record will come out of the blue that does not exist in our rules. Previously, the rules included the ability for mods to use their own discretion and make exceptions when this happened. This caused major problems as almost every record that was allowed or removed would make someone angry based on what actions had been taken on other comparable posts. It is extremely difficult for a diverse group of mods to make consistent choices when we all have different ideas about what counts as exceptional or worthy of posting. Some are obvious. Many are not.

In the hope the changes made as a result of this discussion will hugely diminish these kinds of conflicts, we would like to maintain the 'no exceptions' rule. That is how we can maintain the most amount of consistency and fairness.
However, we are not unaware of the pickle this could put us in if some currently unimaginable achievement should be reached. We welcome any suggestions for how to manage such a situation.

* Unilaterally and immediately add the new achievement to the allowed list and bring attention to it in the following Town Hall
* Have an internal vote among the moderators and add or ban it in the rules immediately based on the results
* Immediately make a dedicated discussion post for that exact issue (probably stickied!) to get feedback and help make a decision. Maybe with a vote?
* Wait for the following Town Hall to discuss and make a decision about it together with the subreddit
* Enforce the 'no exceptions' rule absolutely. Anything new is removed
* Suggestions?

I imagine some issues with copyright because all of their songs are YG and Teddy owned. Most of what their identity/selling point is basically a product of whatever swag YG was trying to embody but I may be wrong. 

What are your opinions about it?

I just feel like the members are in weird positions nowadays, Bom is in a show where she feels the gap left by her members and Minzy is having agency issues again. I cant think that they dont actually want to get back together.",6,8

I mean there's always at least a cat or a dog in 1 group. Even more kinds of animal: fox, mouse, turtle, horse or... unicorn. And those names are ridiculously accurate, from their appearances or personalities.
So who do you think that resembles an animal the most?
In my opinion, the most ""human cat"" I've ever known is Seventeen's Woozi. He's that cat who never lets you touch him but he will jump into your lap when he needs a rest. And he never moves or talks sweet unless he needs to fill his endless stomach. Very chic and independent but sometimes just too adorable that everyone loves him.",84,53

You listen to any song from 2NE1 and Bom's singing overshadows her colleagues. The critique is her lack of technique yet technique can be subjective, I know many singers who are technically efficient yet have bland singing voices like Park Boram. 

Zia sounds like an elderly woman when she sings. She'd be more suited to Trot instead of ballads. 

Victoria was often seen as the eye-candy in F/X.",35,0

Unfortunately I have not calculated the results of the most recent Jukebox thread but I'll edit this text when I do and tell you what song was the highest rated last week!

I don't really have anything planned (but really, are you surprised at this point?) and I gotta make a song list and I want to try and post this by 6 PM PST so, let's get right to it!

I'll try choosing a variety of songs and recent releases we missed in August, but I also want to include a song from Red Velvet's *The Red*, because it's the 4th anniversary of the album coming out! Let's see what we can come up with this week:

1. [Girls' Generation-Oh!GG - Lil' Touch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdzLl-XpJt0)
2. [SEVENTEEN - Crazy in Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7buHJ_BHnfo)
3. [Chungha - Chica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccX6lLy2Ydw)
4. [X1 - Flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlQEKB2H7z4)
5. [Monsta X - Shoot Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS10Zz49FHE)
6. [Red Velvet - Huff N Puff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hap6JNfRQ40)
7. [MV] [Sunmi - LALALAY ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpMyjzW59P0)

Well that definitely took longer than an hour LMAO guess this is going up at 7 PM PST!

Wanna answer the question? Here's the rules! Each week there are seven songs up to review on Jukebox. Listen to the song(s) you want to review and then leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song(s) in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song is not something you're crazy in love for, and 10 being this is a song you loved in a Flash! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you may use the music video to inform your overall score for the song  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

You can keep reviewing songs until this Saturday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your reviews and comments in by then!

I just discovered k-pop recently by accident and I really love it, gave me Alina Barez vibes.  
So this was the song that randomly popped out while listening to a playlist on spotify.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ-wnbiUiHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ-wnbiUiHw)  

The musician seems to be called ""Wildberry"".

My questions is, are there any similar music style/vibe artist, songs?  


I don't know any k-pop bands, so hopefully I can receive some help here .\_ .

Thanks in advance.  


P.S Not sure if I picked correct flair.",1,1
1052,2019-09-09,2019,9,9,16,d1nuct,What are your rankings of the Queendom performances for the first round?,strawberryvar,1568015572,"**1. (G)I-DLE**

Their performance was so creative, and the intro was fantastic. Props to Soyeon for thinking of it, super entertaining. Personally, I think Minnie shined the most and OWNED it, she suited the 'sorcerer' concept so well.

**2. AOA**

They still got it! I loved this performance so much. The dance break was so good, and it was refreshing to see them dancing together again. I think both Seolhyun and Chanmi shined the most, but they did really well. 

**3. MAMAMOO**

They were so close behind AOA. Their performance was great as well, they have so much charisma and stage presence. Moonbyul showed up for work and collected her pay, what a legend. Also Wheein looked gorgeous with the dark hair. 

**4. OH MY GIRL**

Their performance was great, don't get me wrong, but I wish they did more with it. Aside from the short intro with the ribbons, it just felt like a music show performance to me. Every other group changed up their song in some way, however theirs stayed relatively the same. YooA and Binnie really shined in this performance (but when don't they tbh?)

**5. LOVELYZ**

I don't know their names yet, so please excuse me lol. Their performance was alright, just not as entertaining as the others IMO. The dance break was cool, just wish the fuckers at Mnet would've FOCUSSED on it (like jc the girls put so much emphasis in the preview clip on how important the break was, and yet you decided to focus the cam on the girls in the back???) I think Kei and the girl with red hair really stole the show (not sure of her name). 

**6. PARK BOM**

I thought it was cool how they brought out the choir at the end. While she definitely did well, her performance was pretty forgettable after all of the other performances. Still good though. (Also did anyone else almost cry when she brought up how lonely she felt without the other 2NE1 members? Almost bawled.)

**1. (G)I-DLE**

Their performance was so creative, and the intro was fantastic. Props to Soyeon for thinking of it, super entertaining. Personally, I think Minnie shined the most. She claimed that stage and that performance. She definitely suited the 'sorcerer' concept the best out of all of them, esprcially with her dark bangs that just blended into the whole theme. I loved how they changed the dance break after the first chorus, and I appreciated how Shuhua changed up the dance just a little bit. Overall, a fantastic performance. 

**2. AOA**

They still got it! I loved this performance so much. The dance break was so good, and it was refreshing to see them dancing together again. I think both Seolhyun and Chanmi shined the most, but they all did really well. Yuna covering ChoA's high notes was just heaven. I really loved how they changed the song but still kept it similar to the original. 

**3. MAMAMOO**

They were so close behind AOA. Their performance was great as well, and I really was able to admire their charisma and stage presence in this performance, particularly Moonbyul and Solar. Those two are born performers. The outfits were cute, and Wheein looked great with the dark hair (as much as I love Blonde Wheein, she rocks the dark chocolate colour). Overall, a great performance but what do we expect from Mamamoo? 

**4. OH MY GIRL**

Their performance was great, don't get me wrong, but I wish they did more with it. Aside from the short intro with the ribbons, it just felt like a music show performance to me. Every other group changed up their song in some way, however theirs stayed relatively the same. Binnie really stood out to me in this performance, she's improved a lot.

I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back on thursday night for update!

There are so many artists and groups out there and some debut songs aged well, some didn't. Of course it depends on when they came out and other aspects. Time always has some sort of effect on songs, I guess.

What's your favorite? Which one stood the test of time for you? Which one didn't? Whether it's one year or 10 years, time does affect music.

I'm not a big girl group fan (yet), but I'm looking forward to the answers about girl groups and checking those out.

[Replay (SHINee)](https://youtu.be/VTASffPQGhY) is probably the perfect, timeless debut song. 

[No more dream (BTS)](https://youtu.be/rBG5L7UsUxA) has an MV that has aged horribly (probably wasn't cool to begin with), but the song is still a bop.

I was listening to [Crown](https://youtu.be/W3iSnJ663II) today (TXT) and it's such a good song. I liked it from the start, but it's genuinely a good song that doesn't get boring. They're new, but I realized today I didn't appreciate the song as much as I should have when it came out. I think it will age well.

I'm looking forward to your answers!",272,192

We can just be friends and stuff then hopefully start a dance group. Nothing too serious, just for fun!

Within the next couple years it would be nice to see it become a norm in the west just as much as listening to western artist is a norm in the east.even though there are already collabs between western artist and kpop artist(Dua Lipa and Blackpink, Monsta X and French Montana,BTS and Juice Wrld for examples) these songs are often overlooked by most western mainstream media(even though those artist are big names in the west I haven't once heard any of those songs on the radio).A large reason for the fact kpop has such an exclusive community is a lot of people cant get past the language barrier which has always been dumb to me because of the fact that you dont walk into an art music and discredit someone's painting cause they dont speak the same language as you right? At the end of the day music is art and theres more to it than just lyrics.Another big reason is the fangirls,even though they account for only 40% of the community since their voices are louder than the other 60% of the community thats all people from the outside looking in views the kpop community as,a bunch of ravenous fangirls with an idol obsession.Overall though I feel like kpop has a very promising future in the west as the community steadily grows thanks to the gateway artist paving the way",1,2

I got the idea of this discussion to listening to some of the songs on my playlist that is really good but fairly unknown.

 I just think it would be interesting to see other people picks of k-pop songs that are hardly ever mentioned but yet some of their favorite k-pop songs. 

my picks for hidden gems would include

* [ONF - Complete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka9zaVL28OY) Easily in my top 10 songs of 2018. It's just a really good song and It hurts that no one ever talks about how good this song is. 
* [Awesome Baby - Why would I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLvNgZvIV4Q) It gives me 90's r&amp;b girl group vibes. I'm a sucker for acapella elements and girls in suits.
* [Parc Jae Jung - Ice Ice Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W8rN1elQI) 
* [Lim Kim - Upgrader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QS6vi-_Pak) A lost in time b-side that is still a staple in my playlist

as for an actual hidden gem 

* [Jonghyun - Fortune Cookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9CjXKisv-s) even though this song is known well within the fandom, I wanted to include it since it is a hidden track on his base album (meaning it was only on the physical album versions)

**What is the purpose of this discord?**

This discord is set up to be a direct way to get in touch with moderators if theres any issues, questions, etc. involving the subreddit. Modmail is still a viable place to reach out to us, but this is also another way for you to reach out to us.

Weve limited the amount of chat channels so that the discord is focused on the subreddit first. We will most likely set up a Discord Moderator application form in the future to further expand the discord to have more channels. 

Lets walk you through the categories and channels we currently have.  


1. **Welcome**  
1. #welcome is our welcome channel were you can find the invitation link and general rules for the discord.  
2. #server-suggestions is where you can suggest emojis, chat channels and other improvements for the discord.  
3. #roles. We've set up Robyul to include a massive amount of roles. These roles reflect artists' popularity from this years census.  

2. r/kpop
   1. \#meta-posts is going to be the place where the moderators publish the upcoming town halls with an agenda and a direct link to the subreddit. This will only be used by moderators. 
   2. \#discussion is the place to talk generally about the subreddit. 
   3. \#questions where you can ask moderators your questions about the subreddit. If theres rules youre curious about or if theres a post/comment removed you can head here.
   4. \#answers is where we answer the questions you asked in #questions, we will tag you so you know when weve answered your questions. This will only be used by moderators.
   5. \#suggestions if youve got any tips for the subreddit.  

3. **AMAs**
   1. \#ama-announcements will be the channel where we directly link to an AMA announcement from Reddit.
   2. \#ama-discussion is where you can freely talk about upcoming amas, past amas or amas in general.
   3. \#ama-suggestions is where we ask for your help for potential AMAs candidates. Ive set up some strict rules for how to suggest the candidates so please take a look at the pinned message there to see the format on how you should post it.  

4. **Feeds**
   1. \#kpop is the reddit feed from r/kpop
   2. \#kpoppers is the reddit feed from r/kpoppers
   3. \#kpophelp is the reddit feed from r/kpophelp  
These channels are set up by RoByul at a 1 minute delay.  

5. **Chat Channels**
   1. \#general is where you can talk freely about anything. 
   2. \#boy-groups Anything boy group related.
   3. \#girl-groups anything girl group related.
   4. \#memes because we really like memes. Just not plastic pants.  

6. **Bot Corner**
   1. \#commands if youre familiar with RoByul and use her commands, this is your place to be.
   2. \#bot-games if you want to test your k-pop knowledge, come here and test out RoByul!

Pretty simple: what concept/era from one of your favorite groups would you give to another group? 

Which would fit best? 

I'm currently stanning TWICE and my ultimate girl group is SNSD (the original OT9 lol) so I'd love for to see something more mature from TWICE.

So I'd give them The Boys/Mr. Mr. eras to them.

I think it would fit so perfectly. Maybe that's what they are going for with this new comeback, it's already looking more mature.

Please give me your thoughts ",37,25

I went from liking the member I found the most handsome to liking members I found that were funny or cute in some way.

So, who would you have picked as your bias if you had the same taste as you did back then?

NCT: My bias is Mark because hes cute and a hardworker. Younger me would have liked Jaehyun because hes coolly handsome.

Stray Kids: My bias is Han Jisung because he is cute and talented. Younger me would have liked Hyunjin or Minho because they are handsome and have that heartthrob feel.

And also vice versa! Who would have been your bias back then if you had the taste you have now?

Infinite: I still like L, but I probably would have had Sungyeol as my bias because hes bright and funny.

Teen Top: I still like L.Joe, but I probably would have liked Ricky or Chunji since they are cute and bubbly.",61,36

Secretary Cho is being investgated for allegations made in his confirmation hearing for his office of Justice, and one of those allegations is that he has invested to private equity fund, whose LPs are Secretary Cho's relatives only, which allegedly puts him in the conflict of interest. The private equity GP is being investigated for fraudulent report of capital stock of his fund. \[3\]

What revealed yesterday was, that The Super SP Yoon bought a sizable amount of WFM(named A1N at the time), and it is bought out by the private equity of Secretary Cho's. \[4\]

Secretary Cho is very controversial figure in Moon administration, because the president Moon puts whole faith in him yet he wasn't able to refute all the allegations against him till now. 

I wanted to share things I studied as clear as it can be, but my English skill gets in my way. Hope you can ask me a question if you have any. I don't want to make false allegations on anybody, but I think you have right to know these things. 

I will attach media reports and pictures, but \[2\], \[3\] and \[4\] doesn't have English translations.

I feel like Monsta X and Seventeen would make a great tour, especially considering both groups share a lot of fans.  Maybe add GOT7 to the mix and it'd be a super sensual show.  It'd also be interesting to see a full post-IOI or post-PD101 tour, with Gugudan, DIA, Weki Meki, WJSN, Chungha, Somi, the ex-Pristin members willing to perform, and maybe (G)-Idle with a special guest of Sohye when they're in Korea.

_______________________________________________________________

**If you read any of my previous giveaway posts, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **10** brand new, unopened Dreamcatcher ""Raid of Dream"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating three things:


1.  Since its been a while since the last giveaway and they have released a few new songs, what is now your favorite Dreamcatcher song?

2.  What is your favorite Dreamcatcher cover?

3.  Who is your bias?  Has it changed since you first started following the group?  If so, why?


I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I am adding a new rule this giveaway.  If you are mostly a lurker here on reddit but you are active in the Dreamcatcher discord or the /r/Kpop discord, you may still enter, just leave your discord name on your entry or PM me if you are uncomfortable having that information public, and I will check your activity on discord and approve your entry accordingly. 

I will leave the entries open for a few weeks and draw the winners near the release date.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

**NEW RULES**

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  

*As an aside to my normal post, I just want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!*
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.  And just so people know I am not kidding, I can confirm there are multiple people who have won 2 giveaways.**",99,128
1529,2019-09-13,2019,9,13,5,d3dhjl,"If ""Kingdom"" was a thing after Queendom, would it work as well? Which 6 groups would you want in the show?",AutocorrectMyLife,1568318487,"I'm loving the performances so far on Queendom, and it got me thinking if a male version would work as well. 

NOTE - Not trying to create a war, just genuinely curious. Please hear me out.

Take AOA, they rock the sexy concept. OMG does the fairy concept perfectly. There's a clear difference between Lovelyz and Mamamoo. To me it's really interesting to see a variety of groups with a different vibe participate in Queendom.

As I don't really follow male idol groups, I'm not sure if there is a vast difference between them and their group aesthetic, so I can't say if Kingdom could work or not.

Now, my questions for you all are this:

1) Are there male groups that have a signature concept that the public recognises them for? Please give examples if possible.

2) If Kingdom was a thing, could it be as diverse and what groups can you see in this show?

Thanks!",131,111

For me I had 2 songs that really took over my Spotify:

 WJSN - Boogie Up : Doing their Starship veterans Sistar proud, Boogie Up was my personal anthem of the summer. This song is basically pure summer and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It makes me think of pounding whiteclaws on the beach until I blackout and wake up with sand all over my bed. 

Gfriend - Fever: The opposite of Boogie Up, it's gives me more of a steamy, dark summer night kind of vibe. I can imagine hearing this song on a hot night in one of those fancy clubs with a bathroom attendant who gives you paper towels to dry your hands. 


Honorable Mentions:

Gidle - Uh Oh

Rocket Punch - Bim Bam Bum

Fanatics - Sunday

I'm interested to hear what song(s) was the summer anthem of 2019 for everyone else.",56,75

BTS is considered to be paramount to bringing K-Pop world-wide as a whole, but now that it has a foot-hold, do you think their disappearance as a full group/entirely for a few years will impact anything? Other groups like ATEEZ, Monsta X and NCT are beginning to gain popularity abroad. Girl groups less so, but It's starting to pop up with the likes of BlackPink and Twice. K-Pop is starting to finally be more that a novelty to most Westerners. Whom do you think will take the reign during the hiatus? Do you think their will be a lull in popularity of the genre or will they push harder with other groups?",15,0

Or do you think they will forego it counting on music charts and a record because its still bringing in awareness and views from curious people who catch the ad?

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

1682,2019-09-14,2019,9,14,19,d43qmj,Who has some of your favourite voices?,TA5226,1568458676,"As I was listening to songs, I realised those with my favourite vocal colours tend to become my biases. I am curious to know whose voices do you like the most? It doesn't have to be the main vocal, but most of mine are main vocals. Here's mine:  


1. Irene - I especially love her lower register, it's very space-y (deep hollow?) and occasionally husky. I feel like I can sink into it every time. It's sultry and very enticing but her higher one is so sweet too. Like those in [Be Natural](https://youtu.be/_XijRopBGv0?t=45), [Look](https://youtu.be/qD0kPiizEOU?t=61) and this [trot performance](https://youtu.be/xBhjWUO1FHc?t=236). Even in Umpah Umpah, her short line is surprisingly low. Then there are her sweet ones like in Umpah Umpah and See the Stars. Shoutout to her [Taste rap](https://youtu.be/ubOKdWQYyls?t=119). 
2. Wheein - Everything about her voice is perfect, but Irene's low register just edges it for me to be no 1. I feel like no matter what, Wheein's always underrated (she's my ult so I may be biased). Anyway, if Irene's voice is something I can sink into, Wheein's voice is like honey. It's loaded with emotions, it's powerful yet delicate. Recent solo [Good Bye](https://youtu.be/U_dpIqCDcZk?t=8) shows everything that needs to be shown. Rather than pinpointing parts, just going to throw in some of my favourites here: [Immortal Song's Love Story of a Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn7yICySgpA), the [recent AOA cover of Good Luck](https://tv.naver.com/v/9848128) and [Immortal Song's Backwoods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-daQOgl4c). Just beautiful. 
3. Yonghoon - His voice is so versatile, like in their recent cover of [(G)I-dle's Latata](https://youtu.be/SPmIA5QwV0c?t=9). It's very reverb-y. His low notes are soothing and his [high notes are gorgeous](https://youtu.be/vm7O2JIGrxg?t=168) (2.48-3.18). I tend to not like it when guys do high notes, but his is absolutely beautiful. It doesn't sound grating in the slightest and it is quite unique (then again, I don't listen to boy groups too often). In Regulus, he showcased it perfectly. Give it and their other songs a listen!
4. Jae - I'm not sure what I like exactly about his voice but I like the occasionally raspy sound he gives. If anyone can help describe his voice I would be very thankful haha. Here in the bridge of [Time of Our Life](https://youtu.be/vnS_jn2uibs?t=153), [I Would](https://youtu.be/SgM3LZutH_4?t=50) and [Cover](https://youtu.be/9EqJxUu36xA?t=30). In their Japanese releases it shines even more like the entirety of Stop the Rain. 

Shoutout to: Moonbyul, Taeil, Seunghee from CLC and OMG, Yuqi, Young K and Sana in Breakthrough (lol).  


I wish I could do a better job describing their voices, feels like I'm doing them a disservice. Might not be the best songs to show their vocal colours too as I have terrible memory. But I just want to discover more idols with beautiful voices so am making a post about voices here!",258,131

What surprised me even more, is that people turn around and then sell them. I'm just baffled because I only buy albums that I want and plan to keep for a very long time, even then, I just purchase one. Why are you investing your money in things you don't plan on holding onto for years. I don't even buy digital albums without checking the album out first to see if its worth it and digital albums are cheaper than physicals. Thank god for streaming services.

Do you guys waste money by buying multiple copies of physical albums and then find yourself getting rid of them quickly either by selling, giving them away or throwing them out? 

Do you stick to streaming services to listen to your music?

I know buying multiple albums is part of the Korean fan culture, just trying to find out if it's that big of a deal with international fans?",33,0

&amp;nbsp;

Hey, Im u/griffbendor and youre now on a special edition of r/kpops Jukebox! Last week we had artists such as Sunmi, Chungha, Monsta X, and more featured on Jukebox. The highest rated artist of last week has yet to be determined, as submissions are open until tonight at 11:59 PM PST! So, if you wanted to review Chica, Lil Touch, LaLaLay and more  hurry, youve got a couple more hours to review those songs! In the meantime though, lets get on with this Jukebox special.

Welcome to a special edition of Jukebox  today is its 2nd Anniversary! Yep, thats right  two years ago, [the very first Jukebox thread was posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/) to r/kpop. It was a sweet situation and oh, what a situation Jukebox has been! With over 580+ songs reviewed, 200+ artists featured, and over 3000+ reviews, Jukebox has seen quite a lot. 

In honor of this special occasion, this week were going back to where we started, with seven artists and another all-star line-up just like the very first time. Here are this weeks songs!

1. [Red Velvet - Umpah Umpah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8) 
2. [EXO - Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8) 
3. [hyukoh - Comes and Goes ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8) 
4. [TWICE - Three Times a Day ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8)
5. [GFriend - Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8)
6. [MV] [Brown Eyed Girls - Kill Bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyBTH3hCyWo) ([Performance version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx8mmWZxWuQ))
7. [NCT Dream - Chewing Gum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwmvF5ffmhg)

BONUS JUKEBOX:

8\. [Wonder Girls - Why So Lonely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGODWJgR-c) *  
9\. [Hilary Duff - What Dreams Are Made Of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uen-A9Yw67Y)  ([The Lizzie McGuire Movie version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvmJxKbgxr8))  
10\. [Jonas Brothers - Burnin Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNEZJ6KkLI)  
11\. [Zac Efron, Ashley Tisdale - You Are The Music in Me (Sharpay version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H77zsypWRH0) (orig. High School Musical 2 soundtrack)  
12\. [Taylor Swift - Cruel Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic8j13piAhQ)

\* NOTE: You may/may not recognize that Wonder Girls Why So Lonely is a song that we have already reviewed on Jukebox, HOWEVER, as a special exception (since were trying something new), Why So Lonely has been put on Jukebox once again for review. __Please read the Special Instructions for this song very carefully.__ 

First time with us on Jukebox? No fear, the rules are still the same as they have been the past two years! Heres a runthrough:

* Each review must come with a score between 1 - 10, inclusive. 1 being this song being this song is something that comes and goes and doesnt stay in your mind, and 10 being this song has got that Juice!
* Every review should provide some sort of insight into your thoughts and your score for the song. You are encouraged to be creative (but substantive) and have fun with your review(s)! Leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself.
* Downvoting someone's review/comment/rating doesn't change the overall score. I am literally just going to be taking each of the scores you assign and calculating a weighted mean, which will be the final score for that song.
* You will get the chance to review an MV each week! The song chosen for MV review that week will be tagged [MV] in front of it; you can use the music video to inform your overall score, but that is totally optional and up to you!

The same rules for the seven k-pop songs apply for the five bonus songs! Again, rating those is optional, but today, we will turn into r/popheads for one week (and one week only) and review some non k-pop (albeit they all correspond to a similar theme). Also, **you can potentially pick all seven songs on Jukebox next week if you can correctly guess the theme**  see the ""Other Business"" section below! As always, if you are confused about what to do feel free to [check out the very first Jukebox thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/).

1728,2019-09-15,2019,9,15,7,d4c58p,Nugu group appreciation,vegastar7,1568500525,"I like to give groups from small companies a chance (that is, listen to their music to see if I like it). Usually, new k-pop acts from big companies have a leg up since these companies have bigger marketing budgets, but I don't think it's fair for groups to sink into anonimity just because they don't have the budget for fancy marketing. The problem is,  I'm wholly dependent on Youtube to recommend me k-pop videos. I have no idea where to look for nugu groups outside of recommendations. So I wanted to start a thread where posters can advertise whatever nugu group they like.

I'll start:

[Target](https://kprofiles.com/target-members-profile/) \- just discovered this group a few days ago through [this video](https://youtu.be/4_-yTOkAJjw) (Baby come back home).

[D-Crunch](https://kprofiles.com/d-crunch-members-profile/) \- Debuted last year. I especially like their [debut song](https://youtu.be/u5UtcO5L1N8) (Palace), though the MV has really lo- production values (very poorly lit)

[7 o'clock](https://kprofiles.com/seven-oclock-profile/) \- This group debuted in 2017 but already had member and label change, which usually isn't a good sign. I liked [this song of theirs](https://youtu.be/PL5TMNg3LhY) (Nothing better)

[Up10tion](https://kprofiles.com/up10tion-members-profile/) \- So these guys have been around for about fours years now, but their fame really declined between their 2-3 year. I don't think they got too much of a bump from having members in Produce 101. [Here's their latest song](https://youtu.be/BOo3fJ8lqbA) (Gravity)

They're all boy groups. I generally lean towards more ""energetic"" music, and a lot of girl groups don't deliver that sound (notable exceptions being 4Minute, F(x), and Blackpink). That's just my personal preference, but feel free to advertise girl nugu groups also.",122,177
1729,2019-09-15,2019,9,15,7,d4c9ua,Looking for a KPOP music video,highlyoffensxve,1568501172,"This is definitely a question for people that listen to early/late 2000's kpop\~

I'm trying to find a music video from a while ago, if anyone could help I'd really appreciate it.

So the plot of the music video is, a guy (this was kind of a rock video? idk.  his hair was dyed brown and he had sort of a fringe.  wore black clothing a lot).  he's at this church and his ex i believe is at the casket.  she died because she had headphones on and a drunk driver hit her.  something happens, and i forget how they get to this point but basically somehow he's able to go back in time before he and his ex met.  she's a dancer, i believe in modern ballet.  he saves her from getting run over once, and she trusts him and they start this montage of cute dating scenes.  in the end, it's not her that dies, but him- he gets run over by the drunk driver.  

I don't think it's CNBLUE but a band similar to CNBLUE",2,1

Especially after the years go by in your fandom, I think it's fair to say the way you choose your bias (or they choose you lol) you start to notice you might have a type. 

For me my biases are predominantly who I think it's the goofiest/funniest/silliest of the group. 

That's how I end up with J-Hope/Hyoyeon, for example, as some of my biases.

But we all that one bias that it doesn't fit at all what you usually like in your type but you just can't help be drawn to that person. 

For me it's Nayeon from TWICE. I almost never have the oldest member (and leaders) as my bias but I just can't fucking help with Nayeon. I don't know how to explain but I just love her and everything she does is endearing to me.

I guess in that case she chose me lol

I went to see DAY6 in New York City last night. This was my fourth time seeing them, and if you have never seen them live I highly encourage you to do so. The concert was absolutely electrifying. What started off as a disaster of a trip turned into one of the best nights of my life.

I live in Maryland, so I usually take a bus to get to New York City since it only takes a few hours to get there. The bus was supposed to leave at 1:15pm. Friday the 13th was the culprit for our bad luck. My friend got stuck in traffic, and was about to miss the bus to NYC. The next bus wouldnt have came until 6pm, so we would have missed the show. Luckily, the Megabus was late and my friend came right as the bus was pulling up.

We got on the bus and headed to the city to see DAY6. When we arrived at the venue at about 5:30pm, there were lines everywhere. Crowds of people were lined up all around the playstation theater, and in the alley ways and sidewalks near by. We werent sure where to go, but one of the security guards just said to just go to the end of the line and a staff member would pull us out into our designated line. We both had p2 that comes with high touch. My friend and I were hesitant to trust this staff member since line organization to Playstation theater is usually a mess. It all worked out because a Subculture staff member came around and put us into our designated lines. Once the doors were open, check-in went pretty quickly. We had about an hour before the show started, so most people just stood around, or went to the march table.

The playstation theater was absolutely stunning inside. There were crystal chandeliers on the ceiling and sparkling wooden floors. My friends and I decided to head to the back of GA since it would be a better view and we would have room to dance around.

Once everyone was inside the venue and in their spots, the excitement started to grow as we all knew DAY6 would soon be appearing on the stage before us. At around 7:30pm, the lights dimmed and a video began to play announcing the entrance of DAY6. The mood was jovial as everyone cheered and screamed.

The members took their place on stage one by one, as Dowoon lead the way. The members jumped right into a medley singing Best Part Sing Me and I wish. After the first few songs, the members introduced themselves and were already proud of how high everyones energy was. Jae said that he wanted to keep the energy high throughout the concert so they could vibe with us. In between songs, the members would talk to us about how they were so grateful to be here. I dont want to give any setlist spoilers since others may be going to one of their shows, but I will say that the bops just kept on coming. 

The members didnt really take a break and kept playing throughout. Someone screamed that they would catch Jae if he wanted to crowd surf, but he laughed it off and said that we will see. Spoiler, (he didnt end up crowd surfing). The each had solos and sang medleys did a mixture of popular songs intertwined with their own songs. The crowds energy was alive and strong all throughout the concert. Fans jumped around, shouted, cheered and simply enjoyed the show.

Towards the middle of the concert, there was a part where DAY6 played instrumental versions of their songs as they wanted us to sing along to them playing. That was one of the most memorable parts for me because you could tell that the members were definitely impressed and grateful for our singing. Jae and Young K spoke the most in English, while Sungjin and Wonpil mostly used a translator. Dowoon also tried his best to communicate with us using English.

After DAY performing for about two hour straight, we knew that the concert would soon be coming to a close. DAY6 finished uo their last few songs before exiting the stage. Once they exited, a video played which purpose was to show off the teams teamwork, Again, I wont post any spoilers in case people are planning to see on of their shows.

The lights popped turned on as DAY6 came back to the stage for an encore. Jae asked the crowd to put our phones away so we could just vibe out all together and enjoy the memories without recording. Confetti flew as the members finished up their last song. Everyone was jumping up and down and just having the best time .Once finished, the members individually gave speeches stating their thanks. They promised New York that they would be back with new music, and asked us to wait for them. They said their goodbyes. And just like that, another concert was in the books.

Hi- Touch

My friends and I had p2, so were able to do hi-touch with DAY6. I highly recommend to have a person in front of you go slow so you can experience the hi-touch a little less quickly. My friend decided that she would be the one to walk at a slower pace, so we then went to the p1 and p2 waiting area. We waited for about almost an hour before the hi-touch began. This was a great time to socialize and make new friends. A lot of people were giving out free goodies and photo cards. The staff broke down the stage before taking us into a room where hi-touch was. The staff told us to move quickly, but they didnt physically put their hands on us to get us to move faster. Wonpil was first and he was actually sitting on the table. I said Hi and thank you. Jae was next and I said thank you so much I had an amazing night. Both him and Young K looked so happy, and both told me thank you. Sungjin was extremely thrilled to see fans and was eager to give us hi-fives. He made it seem like it was the fan's hi-touch event instead of his haha. Dowoon was last and adorable per usual. I like the fact that the hi-touch didnt seemed rushed at all.

Overall, this was one of the best concerts of my life. DAY6 sang effortlessly with such grace. They sounded amazing live. A night to remember for sure.",15,89

##Census Results

The 2019 Census closed as August ended! The turnout was fantastic. Thank you all for participating! Were handling more data.than past years so we want to make sure we take the time to manage that properly. We are working to make the data more interactive than with simple images like previous years, which means building systems for viewing the data from the ground up. We want people to have a better understanding than something static images can provide--more interactive charts for the results and possible ways to connect sets of the data. Currently multiple mods are working together on the project, and we expect it will be done fairly soon, but we don't want to put a date on it and let people down if it's not done right on that date.

&amp;nbsp;

##Achievements Discussion 

The other major project weve had brewing for many months is the big achievements discussion. It is already underway!

[Charts and Achievements: The re-re-re-redux!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d0ueyn/charts_and_achievements_the_rerereredux/)

This post is the culmination of notes taken from your suggestions in Town Halls, modmail, and whenever we removed records that were not explicitly stated in our current rules. We know this issue has generated turmoil over the last 4-5 months, but we hope you will be as motivated as we are to honor what we all really want as a subreddit and join us for the discussion.

The discussion will be ongoing, but we would like to have as much feedback as possible through the rest of September so we can set All-Time Records for the October Town Hall.

&amp;nbsp;

##Discord Server

You might have noticed [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d2swaj/introducing_rkpops_official_discord_server/) being stickied for the past few days. We've recently launched our own Discord server; r/kpop. You're able to get in direct touch with Subreddit Moderators through this server.

You're able to ask us questions about the Subreddit, give us AMA suggestions, chat about your favorite groups as well as your interests outside of K-pop. We'd love for you to join us and shape this server into a hub for r/kpop. We're open for suggestions to what we can improve with it. 

Here's the invite link: https://discord.gg/yUw6HXG

See you on Discord!

&amp;nbsp;

##Reviewing/Setting Posting Guidelines

The following guidelines have been added to the rules based on feedback from previous Town Hall discussions.

###Dance Practices and alternative MVs

Sorry about this one! Weve had some very inconsistent enforcement of it over the last few months, since we hadnt announced it officially with everything else going on.

We are now asking for any specifics that differentiate titles from each other, which is more like how we handle Teasers and other content.

Audio and Official MV posts should have the cleanest titles:

`EVERGLOW - Adios`

Dance practices, Choreography or alternative versions of MVs should have what differentiates them from the cleanest version in the title itself.

`EVERGLOW - Adios (Performance Ver.)` *(The [MV] flair would be added after posting)*

`EVERGLOW - Adios (Dance Practice)` *(The [Dance Practice]] flair would be added after posting)*

More examples: `THE BOYZ - D.D.D (Extended Ver.)`, `KARD - Bomb Bomb (Performance Video)`, `EXO - Tempo (Chinese Ver.)`

###VLOGs

Well make just a small adjustment here to prioritize inclusion of the videos actual title.

`Artist(s) - Full vlog/video Title (Date) [RAW/ENG SUB]`

###Crowdfunding (applies to Makestar, Kickstarter, IndieGogo, Patreon, etc)

* ONLY the 1st announcement of a new funding project can be posted
* NO announcements of reaching a goal or stretch goal can be posted
* Other content may be allowed from the crowdfunding site as long as it complies with other kinds of content we allow (ie. teasers, full interviews, release schedule details, behind-the scenes videos, as well as contests or projects that directly affect an artists official identity, like fandom name/color/slogan, etc)
* Monthly round-up posts are allowed, but can be posted ONLY after checking in with Mods

###Music Show Wins

Requirements at the time of posting (if not met, will be removed): 

* Title: `Artist Name... first win... 'Song Title' on Music Show Name (Date aired)`
* An image that shows the win
* Optional: Include number scores in comments

Acceptable title examples (we especially like first win to be in there somewhere):

`OH MY GIRL have taken first win for 'BUNGEE (Fall in Love)' on SBS MTV The Show (190813)`

`ATEEZ earns first win with ""WAVE"" today on Mnet M! Countdown (190620)`

###Podcasts

* Must be hosted by a K-pop artist or a K-pop artist must be present as a guest
* Title: `Artist name(s) - Name and/or number of podcast episode @ podcast name (Date Posted) [RAW/ENG/SUB]`
* If the podcast is primarily in Korean or another non-English language, you can add [RAW]  or [ENG SUB] when appropriate and [ENG] if it is entirely (or nearly) in English.
* Official channels/sources are required. YouTube uploads are preferable, but Soundcloud or other platforms are also acceptable.
* For now, podcasts will be flaired as `[Variety]`. We will monitor the amount of content that comes in and consider making a specific flair in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

## Quarterly Favorite Releases Discussion Posts

We have wanted to implement a better system for this for some time. Many of you have requested it. Thank you for your feedback!

Every year, users like to make discussions to talk about your favorite releases at certain intervals. Often, these posts are made at times that dont align neatly with what the title advertises. For example, a Whats your favorite song for the first half of the year? title, but its posted in early May. And then another user comes along later to post at the *actual* first half of the year mark at the end of June. 

Wed like to limit these kinds of duplications or overlaps. 

At precise intervals, we will curate posts to serve this purpose. Currently, we believe there will be four per year. 1st quarter, 1st half, 3rd quarter, and an end-of-the-year discussion that will coincide with our r/kpop Annual Awards vote. In these posts you will be able to list and freely discuss your favorite songs, albums, and music videos over the previous quarter or since the start of the year.

The first of these posts will go up on the last day of September!

Any posts of this nature, not made by moderators, will be removed as this will be added to our list of [Banned Topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_banned_topics) from now on.

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d1es34/nugu_roundup_10_wi_geolseu_wi_wi_geolseu_190908/). 

I don't think I've featured a male group at the top yet, so time to fix that this week with Forestella!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Forestella**

**Who are they?:** A four member male Kpop/Classical crossover group under Universal Music Korea.  

**Introduction/Interview:**  [Pops in Seoul Showcase Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKRlQrX06BU)

**Company:**  While Universal is obviously a major music label, it's not really big in the Kpop world, and Forestella isn't getting a ton of promotion from what I can see so I'm going to bend a bit with this one.

**Members:**

* Cho Min-Gyu
   * Position: Leader, Classical Tenor
   * Age: 28 (IA)
   * Facts: Majored in Vocal Music at Seoul National University, can sing in a wide variety of languages, goal is to see Forestella on the Billboard charts
* Bae Doo Hoon
   * Position: Pop/Rock Vocalist
   * Age: 33 (IA)
   * Facts: Majored in acting at the Korean National University of the Arts with a focus on musical theater, is in a Gugak (traditional Korean music) fusion band called Aux, has performed in a number of musical theater productions
* Kang Hyung Ho
   * Position: Tenor/Falsetto Soprano, Rock Vocalist
   * Age: 31 (IA)
   * Facts:  Was a chemist in a research laboratory before joining the group, is the only member without classical vocal training, was in a rock band called PITTA during his time at Pusan National University
* Ko Woo Rim
   * Position: Classical Bass (vocal), Maknae

**Trivia:** Forestella formed after the members met each other on the JTBC show Phantom Singer 2, where they were the winning group.  Their name is a combination of the English word 'Forest' with the Italian world 'Stella' which means star.  They've said that a key to their success and growth as musicians is that they agreed to disregard traditional Korean age/seniority hierarchy during their rehearsals and all members are free to offer free criticism of others as well as to be hard on each other to drive them to perform better.

Are there any videos of groups playing a game that you thought were absolutely hilarious, but have never seen any other group play before? This could also include some older games that groups used to play on variety shows that have fallen out of popularity recently.

I thought of this mostly because of [Run BTS Episode 33](https://www.vlive.tv/video/53320) which is literal comedy gold, but I have never seen another group attempt this game, which shocked me.

I looked at the tracklists and realised that I had forgotten so many of the songs that got me through hard times ala Baby Don't Cry, Heart Attack, Don't Go and What is Love. 

I can distinctly remember how excited and giddy I was to receive those albums and I remember exactly where I was where I first watched the MV for Wolf and its been 5 years since then ...

I'm curious, what are some older songs that you have recently re-discovered and what memories do you associate with them? Are they happy or sad ones? 

I'm really interested in re-discovering the old gems of kpop right now haha",16,28

1891,2019-09-16,2019,9,16,19,d4yre8,What are some of the interesting (mostly weird) dreams that you've had involving kpop idols?,deusvult2001,1568629676,"Well, one of the weirdest (can't really say interesting) dream I had involved Woozi of the K-pop boy group, SEVENTEEN. It's a bit long, so please bear with me.

I actually graduated from high school not too long ago and entered college. Just for clarification, I attended an all-girls school. So, in this dream, I was back at being a senior at school and was in my class. My class looked different in my dream. My uniform was different too( it was a white shirt and green plaided skirt). And my school in the dream was also a co-ed one.

I was in the class packing up my bag to get back home. There were only a few students in my class who were talking to one another while getting ready to leave just like me since all the classes were over. I glanced at the classroom board and noticed that something along the lines of: ""Woozi and (my name) to assemble outside the washroom right after school is over."" Was written on that board. I just ignored it cause I wanted to go back home. As soon as I walked outside the classroom, the next scene I remember is that I was in a car that my family driver was driving and he was taking me home. As soon as be started driving, I mentioned about the notice written on the classroom board. He suggested that I should have gone to that place since it could be something important. I asked him to stop the car and decided to go and check. But, instead of going to the place I was meant to go I started walking towards the back of a building. There were few college students standing there and were talking among themselves. I was about to pass by them but stopped when I noticed this weird (and not to forget, creepy) thingy walking past me. It had the figure of a tall, skinny man but was covered with this brown suit. Yes, suit-like material but it covered his face and hair too which made him look really creepy. I lost my sh*t and started running in the opposite direction. But, as I was running, I went past a guy that resembled Mathew Santoro. He was wearing patient clothes. I got freaked out of him as well and started walking instead of running to avoid him chasing me. But, he chased me anyway but did not hurt me. I suddenly then again started running and arrived at the house where I used to live at earlier with my family. I reached the floor where my grandparents used to live. I looked around for them and realised that they were not there. In fact, no one was there. I just swore and said to myself ""Sh*t, I'm still in the other dimension"". Then I noticed a lady and girl staring at me while smiling through the window. I freaked out and looked away but then I suddenly turned to look behind me and realised that they were standing right behind me and were staring at me with their eyes wide open. They were smirking at me. That shook me to my core. Then suddenly that young girl started calling me Mommy! I'm 18 but that girl looked 8 or 10 so she was not more than 10 years younger than me but was calling me mommy. Then, I realised that the girl was my daughter and that lady was my Mother in law. That guy I found outside was my Father in law. Suddenly, my sister came into the scene. She told me that she was there to get me back to my original dimension. I started walking out with her and suddenly my house turned into an apartment building. I was walking downstairs and looked up and realised that my mother in law was staring down at me in a creepy way. I told her that I would be back in a few hours. She just smiled and went back inside. My sister and I started rushing faster. She told me to get inside the lift but I, without even checking said, that there is no lift in this apartment building. But she told me there is since she came in one. We both got inside the lift and my sister was pressing the button. Suddenly, there was this purple light surrounding me. I suddenly saw and a very pale and very skinny hand on my shoulder. Then I saw a girl with short hair. She was very pale and looked undernourished. But her face was exactly like mine. She walked out of the lift and the next scene I remember I was back in the car and was going back home with my sister. I suddenly thought about Woozi once again and thought that he must have been able to dodge the situation because he didn't he pay attention to the notice.

This was the end of the dream. I've had weird dreams involving NCT, EXO and BTS as well. If you wanna read them, just let me know, I'll gladly freak you all out",8,1

Yet, the G-Dragon post just a week ago garnered nearly 3k upvotes at a &gt;90% upvote rate.  Any posts regarding iKON or Big Bang and even Winner don't see nearly as much hate.

So, there has to be another reason -- just trying to figure it out.",4,0

1942,2019-09-17,2019,9,17,3,d54i9w,Naver Music and MNet charts will be removed from Instiz's iChart starting October 2019.,griffbendor,1568659328,"If you look at [Instiz's iChart](https://www.instiz.net/spage/8) (linked in the subreddit's sidebar) as well as the official [Instiz iChart Twitter](https://twitter.com/instiz_ichart), you'll see that there's a grey notice box below the chart with [the following message](https://imgur.com/a/ukuptlk). It was posted about an hour or so ago ([this is the very first tweet posted two hours ago that included the notice below the chart](https://twitter.com/instiz_ichart/status/1173620132939091968?s=20)). It reads:

&gt; Starting October 2019, iChart will be re-organized.|New Rule:
:--|:--
 |__Naver Music__  Reason: Service Termination
 |__MNet__  Reason: Service Termination (Genie Music reinstated)

&amp;nbsp;

So, basically, what this means is starting October 2019, Naver Music's chart and MNet's chart will no longer count towards Instiz's own iChart, and Genie Music will be re-instated as one of the music charts Instiz will use for tracking songs.

1943,2019-09-17,2019,9,17,4,d54xvc,Any kpop song lyric translation request? (week 56),ThisGuyKpops,1568660810," 

Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. for the sake of time, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So no live, remix, or free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating
5. Be back on thursday to check for translation

P.S: 6th video is taking a bit longer than anticipated, so I made a side video. \[ [History of Kpop's best female idol channel](https://youtu.be/VzMSgyVwsUw) \]

To start:

1. CIX - They really came out with a very strong debut, which seems to be a trend nowadays. I'm definitely ready for whatever they put out next.
2. MONSTA X - I mentioned a few concerns in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/czsxv2/midtier_groups_who_you_think_have_a_decent_shot/ez10sqz/?context=3), but here I'll say that while I love that they have a solidified niche, I wouldn't mind a bit of a twist to their usual title track sound in the next comeback.
3. NCT DREAM -  I'll probably make it through this next graduation cycle, but we still have no idea what's going to happen there. It's only 3 1/2 months left in the year, but no new SM Rookies yet, no word on where the 00 line is allegedly going,  ~~\*Insert generic NCTzen complaint here\*~~
4. BLACKPINK - lol.",295,202
1947,2019-09-17,2019,9,17,5,d566tm,"Seventeen's ""An Ode""",YoonLolina,1568665910,"I've been a Carat since 2015, a little bit after Mansae was released. Thanks to this, I've had the opportunity to see SVT grow artistically and I honestly love to see them glow up.

And hey, I swear that every single album is incredible to me. I like each one even more and, before today, ""Al1"" was my favorite. Moatly because it showcased their talent as artists and musicians. And because Woozi outdid himself with the music. To me, ""Al1"" was (is) more than kpop. The level of their music, voices and performance was way beyond that title. Since then, the only song that could be at that level was ""Home"". 

However, I've kept listening to ""An Ode"" since I woke up. And sweet sweet lord, I'm amazed.

Am I the only one that can see the change? That can realize that this comeback is way different than the others they've had? It's like this album saw ""Al1"" and kicked it's ass. ""An Ode"" is utterly and absolutely amazing. This album is not kpop. At all. This album is a literal piece of art. 

Their music has always evolved with them, but this time is different. I'm so proud of not only Woozi (because damn it, no wonder he's called a genious producer) but also of the rest of the members, because you can see them in every piece. 

Sorry I'm rambling, but I'm just so utterly whipped by this album. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves, because this album is not like any other. I can honestly say that I don't think I've heard any other kpop album/song like this one. ""An Ode"" is gonna change this game.

What did you think of the new album?",1,1

3) RELEVANT BANDS FOR YOU IN BETWEEN
4) END BAND/SONG that you think officially ended your kpop journey or CURRENT BAND/SONG


I'm 26 years old, and mine was:

1. HAENGBOK by Super Junior
 I was culture shocked when my sister showed me this video-- grown men around a pink background and singing so happily During this time, nothing like this was shown in our country (around 2009); I don't know what happened but this song is officially my intro to kpop

2. Hug by DBSK
I saw them in exploration of the human body with suju and I immediately loved Jaejoong, and the band's entire chemistry. I realized I was more of a Cassie than an ELF after some time

3. Lies by BIG BANG, Kissing you by SNSD, Again and Again by 2PM, Rainism by Rain, Come back to me by Se7en, Tell Me by Wondergirls
these were the bands that I also distinctly remember following during my most active kpop years

4. Shinee
Shinee is probably the last band I remember really following, but not as intense as the older bands

I still listen to kpop every now and then though, but I'm not familiat with bands anymore.

So old and new kpop fans alike, how was/is your kpop journey? :)",36,19

#HOW TO RECORD AND SUBMIT YOUR VOCALS

Follow these steps and save us all a lot of pain please. If you already know how to record your voice, skip ahead to step 7.

**Step 1.** Download Audacity (or open Garageband if you're on a Mac.) If you don't have a phone or computer that has a microphone, borrow one. Ask nicely. More specifics on recording with Audacity [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hvurc/project_ranime_sings_colors_by_flow_code_geass_op/?st=j9westlp&amp;sh=fdeb6d0e), via /u/IbrahimT13

**Step 2**. Get some headphones and plug them in. We want to hear ONLY YOUR VOICE, not the song too. If the headphones have a mic, make sure your input in the program is *not* set to that channel, as it's probably inferior to the mic of the computer or phone. 

**Step 3**. Cue up YOU AND I on either Itunes/Spotify or [THIS link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChtjyKMIRCc) on your browser. 

**Step 4.** ~~Open this page and scroll down to the officially sanctioned pronunciation guide below.~~ COMING SOON, watch for a reminder post that includes it, and I'll update it here too! (If you're recording before our Official Pronunciation Guide is up (we luv our early birds), feel free to sing along to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChtjyKMIRCc) lyric video or [these](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2018/05/dreamcatcher-you-and-i) romanizations.

**Step 5**. Put those headphones in your ears, hit record on the software, hit play on the song, then sing your heart out. Remember that kpop groups are *multiple people*. It is not possible to sing all of the lines in immediate order without losing breath or doubling up, so do a bunch of takes. If this is confusing, the easiest thing to do for this song is to record **each member's part** as a separate track. Basically, use common sense: **DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF**. It's alright if you send us a bunch of different audio tracks! It's *not* alright if you record every single word individually and don't bother to combine them. That's *super* annoying!!!

**Step 6**.  If you wanna sing harmonies and adlibs (highly encouraged) please record those as SEPARATE files and include them in the email. Again, **DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF**. 

**Step 7**. Save your masterpieces as a .wav (preferrably in 48kHz), .m4a (preferrably 256kbps or higher), or .flac file and **email that sucker to redditkpop101@gmail.com**. If your files are too big (happens often) please zip them up and send us a download (via mega/mediafire, whatever) link. I know it's tempting, but we'd REALLY prefer you **NOT share a google drive link**, the permissions can get confusing. Several people weren't included on previous tracks because they never responded to my emails begging them to fix the permissions. Don't be that person, it makes me so sad.

&amp;nbsp;

If you found this stupid and confusing, [here is a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBMhf53SSC8). If you're still stupid and confused or have a question about the process, please post it below. Either I or our audio God/Insomnia, /u/rreg29 will answer to the best of our extent.

&amp;nbsp; 

**Some general recording tips. (Adapted from /u/IllllllllI's post).**

* Try to minimize background noise as much as possible; close windows if they were open, turn off machines if they were on etc. 

* If you love the idea of this project and want to contribute long-term, consider buying a little standalone USB microphone. I can personally vouch for the quality and durability of [this](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-iCE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B014PYGTUQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517946380&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=USB+microphone&amp;dpID=31Ju5HK-6bL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch) one for basic use. There are cheaper options on amazon now, but I'm not familiar with them. The editing team will thank you (and probably use more of your vocals, how about that!)

* Don't sing too close to your mic - it causes clipping/distortion.

* If you have the resources, consider **HAND-MAKING** a [quick pop filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Ut4s4ME8Y) for your mic. It'll sound a jillion times better and we thank you for it. 

* Do **NOT** apply ANY effects or filters to your vocal track. The ""pop filter"" we're referring to above is made from a tissue. Send us the raw vocal file.

* This song is high and flutey at points, but there's also some hardcore belting... meaning it's not the easiest thing out there to sing, like, at all. Gentlemen, feel free to octave down for as much as you want, but don't change the key. Fortunately we've got very rhythmic, simple raps this time, so you shouldn't have too hard of a time with that, at least.

* Higher notes are easier to sing if you sing confidently/loudly and with good breath support. 

*  If you have to go screamo or shouty to hit the notes (AND YOU PROBABLY WILL), back away from your microphone please, and keep an eye on the levels of your recording. If you're super loud (like me!!) drop them a bit so your vocals aren't in the red end of the bar the whole time. It's easier to make quiet vocals louder, than louder vocals quieter. (I personally record the majority of my vocal takes from across my apartment on 50% mic volume and am *still* too loud). 

* All in all, this is one of my all time favorite songs, and I can't wait to see how this *nightmare* turns out (sorry).

2180,2019-09-19,2019,9,19,3,d6208y,[News Analysis] Produce X 101 Vote Rigging Investigation: How deep the rabbit hole goes,magekinnarus,1568831471,"\[**Brief Background\]**

After Produce X 101 season finale, a possibility of vote-rigging was raised by many fans. Although previous seasons also had such outcries, they all petered out with no substantive follow-up actions. However, this time around, some K-nets discovered an unusual pattern from the final vote announcement of Produce X 101. (See my previous post: [How K-nets discovered Produce X 101 and Produce 48 Vote Rigging Patterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ci3tit/how_knets_discovered_produce_x_101_and_produce_48/).)

This new development led to an even bigger controversy as Korean media began paying attention to the matter. Under pressure, M-net offered a series of explanations which only added more fuel to the fire as some politicians and other professionals began voicing their utter dismay of M-net's explanations.

With the increasing public and media attention on the issue as well as some Produce X 101 fans forming a ""Produce X 101 Fact-Finding Committee"" to pursue legal action, M-net decided on July 26 to file a criminal complaint to police which led to a police investigation. Police raided the offices of M-net and the data management company on July 31. On August 1, the Produce X 101 Fact-Finding Committee filed a criminal complaint against M-net and CJ ENM to Seoul Central Public Prosecutor's Office. On August 5, the Prosecutor's office assigned the case to its 6th division specialized in criminal investigation and consolidated the previous police case into it opening the way to coordinate with the ongoing police investigation. On August 12, the police raided offices of M-net for the second time and other undisclosed locations. On Sep 2, the police announced that it is expanding its investigation into all 4 seasons of Produce series.

**\[M-net's ingenious legal maneuver: filing a criminal complaint against its own employees to police\]**

This is a rather ingenious legal maneuver by M-net because this preemptive legal move narrows the scope and the direction of the police investigation. M-net's criminal complaint basically saying that rogue employees have harmed the company through illegal activities. This type of complaints is usually used by the companies in intellectual theft and sabotage cases committed by their employees. This sets up M-net as a victim, not as a co-conspirator, and the focus of the case narrows down to the harm and the material damage caused by such activities to M-net.

Companies in this type of situation typically file criminal complaints on both the criminal nature of activities and the damage and harm caused to the company by such activities. However, based on the various reporting on the situation, M-net seems to have filed a criminal complaint only on the damage to the company by the employee activities. And the initial police investigation has moved in that direction.

Kuki News, Sports Chosun, and other news media reported on August 19 that the police was planning on charging the production team of Produce series on the obstruction of business, meaning corporate sabotage, on the basis of changing placements of contestants through vote manipulation. This obviously showed that the police was looking at the case as corporate sabotage committed by a rogue employee group.

**\[Police leak on Aug. 19: Intentional misdirection or M-net's legal strategy veering out of control?\]**

Police Leak of its plan to charge the production team with Obstruction of Business on Aug. 19 is interesting for the following reason; it was later reported that the police already had enough evidence to charge the production team from the first raid, which was focused on obtaining data from Produce X 101. However, the police on Aug. 12 made the second raid and seizure which now known to include the previous seasons of Produce series as well as some of Show Me the Money and Superstar K data.

What is strikingly odd is that the police leak has come a week after the second raid. From the scope of the second raid, it is obvious that the police investigation has expanded to include all seasons of Produce series as well as Show Me the Money and Superstar K involving a multitude of M-net production teams. This implies that the focus of police investigation has shifted from the initial M-net claim of a sabotage act committed by a rogue employee group to a system-wide corruption. In other words, M-net is no longer a likely victim but a likely co-conspirator.

However, the police leak on Aug. 19 was pretty much aligned with the initial M-net claim that it is a victim of a corporate crime committed by a rogue employee group. So, it can be surmised that the police leak was either a ruse to mask the true direction of investigation or a sign of internal conflict within the investigating agencies. It is interesting to note that the Public Prosecutor's Office didn't get involved with the case until Aug. 5 by which time the police already made the first raid and was in the process of building the case against the production team. Thus, it is possible that the direction of the investigation shifted after the involvement of the Public Prosecutor's Office regardless of the intent of the police.

There is also speculation from within the industry and the media that the expanding investigation is to dilute and to delay the Produce X 101 investigation since the newly debuted group from Produce X 101 might be significantly impacted. This speculation stems from a whispered rumor in Yeouido circles that the police has netted all the evidence needed to prove the Produce X 101 vote manipulation and placement changes from the first raid. As the speculation goes, instead of announcing their findings, the police has decided to expand the investigation into not only the other Produce series but go back as far as Superstar K seasons to indefinitely delay any announcements on Produce X 101 investigation findings.

**\[Fraud and Attempt to destroy evidence charge on ""Idol School"" filed to police on Sep. 6: How far will this go?\]**

On September 6, a group of Idol School fans filed a criminal complaint charging CJ ENM with fraud and attempt to destroy evidence to the police. Based on this filing, the police opened a separate investigation into the case.

Opening of the case raised a concern that the case might further delay and complicate this ever-expanding investigation. In response, the head of the Seoul Metro Police held a news briefing on September 17 to state that the police was analyzing through the original voting data, and promised that the investigation would conclude as early as possible.

What is interesting is the scope of investigation hinted by him. He said, ""it is taking time since the investigation also includes the previous season run by the same producer."" This seems to imply that the police is now focused on Season 3 and Season 4 of Produce series produced by Ahn Joon-young.

So, it is still up in the air how all of this will fan out in the end, and how deep the police is willing to follow down the rabbit hole.",1,13

(ex: stay in the music industry whether it be producing/writing songs, leave the music industry entirely/go into something different like fashion, start a family, use their degrees if they have any?) With Monsta X, Wonho and Jooheon definitely have a future in music producing/writing. I'm also curious about ""foreign"" members, will they stay in Korea after their idol days are over or return to their respective home countries like Felix and Chan from Stray Kids or Johnny from NCT?

Hello! So I am currently working on my English Language A-level coursework and need to collect data. The question is: Can slang be used to build a close community in music?

So I was wondering if you could state your opinions or examples of how Kpop does or doesn't use slang to build a tight-knit community.

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

2341,2019-09-20,2019,9,20,6,d6kzqa,For those of you who participate in boycotts of artists or labels - what artist or song do you most miss listening to?,DocLucia,1568930134,"I am a strong believer in a good boycott (hence why I won't be linking any songs that I mention here, FYI). I personally feel like every stream I give on Spotify or view on YouTube is either giving a small amount of revenue or popularity to an artist or song and so I try to avoid streaming those I feel morally or ethically at odds with. With the Burning Sun scandal, YG being an absolute shit-show and various other (very) cheeky misdemeanors going on among the K-pop industry, there are many artists or even whole labels that I feel uncomfortable supporting with my views or streams.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, it does annoyingly mean that I can't listen to some of my former favourite K-pop songs! In particular, I was thinking today songs I really want to listen to but just can't bring myself to:

* BIGBANG songs: god fucking damn it they had some bangers, in particular I miss the old back-catalogue including ""Always"" and ""Fool of Tears"", wanted to listen to both today but can't bring myself to support YG and hearing Seungri's voice skeeves me off.
* Gummy: why is she under YG, she has some of the best vocals I have ever heard (and I'd be damned if the Korean public doesn't agree.)
* SanE: ""Body Language"" is my ultimate hoe anthem and Bumkey's vocals are gorgeous in it, but I can't support a song that oversexualises women which was written by the same man who wrote ""Feminist"". Hard pass.
* Eddy Kim: ""The Manual"" was one of my go-to relaxation songs, and I thought a lovely perspective on relationships. Less cute knowing the kind of guy he is outside of his singer persona.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some that came to mind for me as I wrote this today. But how about anyone else? Do you boycott artists or labels? Do you also feel like you're miss out on some of your favourite music because of it?",49,0

Soon afterwards I discovered their mini albums and listened to all of them Signal, Cheer Up, BDZ, and Merry and Happy. I fell in love with those mixtapes and Ive been a follower ever since. I learned a lot of about them and the whole peace love and positivity thing that he preaches and honesty they kinda shaped out the person I am now, or he helped develop some characteristics of mine but anyways to the point of all this.

I cant even mention I like Twice anywhere at school, they is one of my favorite artists and its a shame. I hear all the disrespect against them all the fucking time and its my first time posting on this sub and idk i just wanted to ask yall for advice. Im scared to say i like them and my school because the one time i did i got called out on it and i got laughed at. Even the teacher was taken back by my choice and it made me feel really sad that i got ridiculed for liking Twice. I hope no pressure turns out to be great so i have ammunition to fire back but as of now what can i say? I just have to sit there and take it all the laughter Its really sad and i just wish my favorite artist would put out an amazing project already because i shouldnt have to feel shame and fear over liking an artist at my school it sucks having to keep that to myself but my girlfriend says they are just haters. But what do you guys think? Any advice? Do you guys and gals have the same issue? What is your opinion? Please let me know and thankyou in advance.",2,0

She has the opposite of the typical kpop lead vocal's timbre, specifically the light lyric soprano voice. Her voice is thick yet warm, similar to black gospel soloist's i guess? Or blues singers. Voices like hers are incredibly unique and rare in kpop (ie exid Hani and gidle Yuqi). Also Yooa's singing technique is fairly clean so that really impressed me as well. She has good control, and she's decently expressive as well.

Are there other clips of YooA singing? Im asking as someone who's not an OMG fan. Hoping to hear more of her voice.

We can also turn this into a discussion! Do you know of other kpop singers with very unique voices like her? What songs/performances of them would you recommend? I can only think of hani and yuqi. But i'm particularly impressed by Yooa as she already is an amazing dancer but in the taeyeon cover she clearly displayed a high skill level (at least to my ear)",65,50

\- Was co-written with Genneo. Amber was feeling frustrated at the first time, felt like she cant do anything. Song started with a really eerie piano and just became what it is.

\- Amber said that the masks in the video are to express not being able to speak up and speak your mind and feelings. pretty much people tie you down and say you can't do anything freely. Telling a story about being locked up and away from being able to take any action. 

**Curiousity** (This is the song that Krystal likes when she commented it on IG)

\-  Amber said the song is sounds like ""JAZZY"". The song its like very very sad and i'm really love how this song going.  

Ready For The Ride: (I think a lot of people might like this song)

\- Everyone love this song and followed by fanchant. Amber said this song was inspired by her sister, Jackie. Because she always love ride to Miami and I told her that I'll make a song for her and jackie's react ""oh really... its cool""  

\-  Amber also said if this song for someone she used to know and everyone tried to figure out and amber look shy on it . Also it was written for someone she's not with anymore, same person 'Three Million Years' is about 

\-  Was written in 30 minutes because Amber had finished a studio session 30mins before Jackie was coming to pick her up and she didn't want to waste time while she waited 

**Stay Calm** (ft. Enik and Friends - is FYKE band)

\- Amber: ""*We're being friends and we never like to each other. I comfortable to shared everything. I've done for everything and this was Stay Calm created. The song is about anger of it. It's gonna be okay.""*

But all kidding aside, SM is home to a wide array of artists with such extensive discographies. They have garnered a rep of having that 'SM sound' that is distinct among other companies with their penchant for unique and often experimental hooks. But bottom line is all of their songs have great production value. 

If you could rank their current group's discographies, how would it be? To make the discussion clearer maybe from groups TVXQ onwards. 

Thought about this because I remember seeing a comment that f(x)'s discography still sounds so relevant even today as their experimental sound was ahead of its time.",39,22

I only watched the episodes and fully kept up with the show during Broduce seasons, for girl seasons I only watched the performances and would check in here and there so I don't feel like I know enough information to comment so I won't.

Fully Believe

  Kang Daniel won. This is just not debatable imo. I didn't understand the Daniel hype the 1st time I watched the show, but it was obviously real. All his fancams trending like crazy after Sorry Sorry and the thigh grab sealing the deal. His whole trajectory to the win is very easy to trace and makes total sense. Also he still trends on Naver all the time, including his past produce fancams. You just can't fake that.

  Jinhyuk not making it. He ranked as high as number 2 because of benefits and he had the strongest 2 pick pair out of everyone. He also had basically no screentime after his breakout during the position evals to keep his burst in popularity going. Even then he still would've made the group without the X twist so it's not like his rank just tanked out of nowhere. He just fell slightly.

  Jinwoo's shocking elimination. There was so much talk within the fanbase of being done with him and finding him annoying. There was also so much talk of him being talentless, despite him being in B class. This was very sad but was believable to me.

Don't Buy

  Guanlin dropping to 20 magically coinciding with Sungwoon rising to 3. While the whole scene of everyone being extremely shocked while Taehyun and Sungwoon are screaming their heads off is one of the best scenes in produce history, this just seems fishy. Mnet obviously loved Guanlin and having him shockingly drop to the lowest possible spot without getting eliminated right before the finale to scare people into panic voting just seemed VERY calculated. I don't feel as strongly about Sungwoon getting 3rd but he really didn't have any screentime or buzz around him that makes it make sense to me.

  Dongpyo getting 6th. He just seemed to not have that strong of a core fanbase the entire season and was ranking just out of debut range for so long that out of nowhere jumping 6 spots on the finale seems like alot. Maybe the people who only tune in for the finale voted him in just because he was the first center, but he really never got any screentime to even make people aware of that towards the end of the show, or even any screentime at all tbh. I think mnet really wanted to keep the 'first center always makes the group' mythos alive, especially after losing the finale center one.

Could go either way

  Minkyu not making it. This still just doesn't make any sense and I still can't wrap my head around it. Why would mnet devote so much time to him, hide his flaws, and always show his improvements only to let him not make the final group? Did he really not make it and mnet just let it happen after putting so much into his edit? I really don't get it.

  Wooseok vs Yohan. Mnet definitely prefered for Yohan to win over Wooseok, but Yohan genuinely beating him was completely plausible, it was a very close race all season. 

  The Jonghyun of it all. I don't know. It's been years and I still don't know.

MY THOUGHTS: I personally believe it was super fucking ignorant of them and i stan them wit hall my fucking heart.

2515,2019-09-21,2019,9,21,14,d76s55,Do you think Kpop Groups singing in English will help break them in to the Western Industry?,revluvly,1569045348,"So companies have done albums and songs in Chinese or Japanese and it did help ease groups in to those markets and gain a lot of new fans from these regions, do you think using that same formula in Western market will get the same results or do you think it wont work? I see a lot of groups releasing English versions of their songs or making completely new English songs and Im wondering if it is garnering them any new fans or if its just circling the same kpop fans? Some western fans I feel get drawn to these groups because of their korean songs so in my opinion I dont think English songs would draw out new fans honestly, it just takes away the uniqueness that would have drawn you in originally. 

The fan culture or the way we consume music in the West isnt the same as Asia, of course catering to their languages is much easier also share the same fan service culture and easier for fans over there to adapt to and it does have similar feel to the original language. I feel doing it in English completely changes it. The lyrics can sometimes be very cringe or it just doesnt flow as well. 

Im not saying releasing songs in English is wrong what Im asking is, if it will give them the results they are seeking? Do you also like your groups releasing multiple English songs or in your opinion do you prefer them with korean songs since thats what drew you in to begin with? Sound off your opinions and let me know your take on this. ",61,38

2517,2019-09-21,2019,9,21,15,d772rg,Have you noticed any common unofficial roles in KPop?,Yelesa,1569047527,"Ive noticed whenever Kpop companies make girl group trios, they tend to follow the [Three Faces of Eve](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThreeFacesofEve) trope a lot (not always, but a lot). I dont mean when members leave, thats not really pre-planned. I mean when they create a group from the ground up. 

Maybe it looks like Im reaching, or this doesnt count because those arent a skill-based role like lead vocalist or main dancer or rapper (of course they arent, thats why they arent official) but looking at how competitive is to be an idol and make it in a group, how in reality this isnt a meritocracy where the best singer/dancer/actor just makes the team, and Koreas obsession with looks which is unlike everywhere else, I think even trios are created as business decisions with physical appearance in mind. Theres a member who is:

* in charge of being cute, often with rounder features than others, or chubbier cheeks, might even be the youngest or shorter than the others
* in a traditionally pretty one, one with balanced features that often fit Korean beauty standards moreso than other members
* in charge of being the sexy one, often with sharper/angular features, or taller, or darker skinned than other members

For example:

* Orange Caramel: Raina (the cute), Lizzy (the pretty), Nana (the sexy)
* SEMINA: Mina (the cute), Sejeong (the pretty), Nayoung (the sexy)
* TWICEs J-Line: Sana (the cute), Mina (the pretty), Momo (the sexy); bonus that JYP brought back Momo in Sixteen after she was eliminated, because he said she fit better with what he had in mind (beside the fact she is a talented dancer, she also had a particular look that fit with what it was shaping to be Twice)
* WJSN C-Line: Xuan Yi (the cute), Mei Qi (the pretty), Cheng Xiao (the sexy). 
* etc.",87,95
2518,2019-09-21,2019,9,21,15,d77993,Has any girl group ever done any comeback show?,mantongssi,1569048926,"I was watching a clip from queendom and I jist found out the winner of the show will get a solo comeback show. The girls were pretty surprised and AOA'S Seolhyun even said ""I always thought that was only for privileged boy groups who are really popular. ""  Seeing such an famous idol such as Seolhyun say that makes me so sad. I don't know I realized, None of the prominent girl groups have had a comeback show. Seventeen, Got7, BTS and several others have gotten their own shows. One could argue some other prominent girl groups probably make more money or are more famous than these groups (except bts ig)

Not trying to put down any boy group but Seeing how much girl groups can offer but not beinf used to the fullest Im just wondering why this is.

Is this because the company's themselves don't want girlgroups to have their show or like is it mnet's doing. It's so fjucking sad to me that these groups are literally competing for something that should come to them naturally.",4,0

Ive read somewhere that in general the gene is said to hit 2 out of 3 men by the time they hit their mid-thirties, and there are often cases where hit can hit much earlier and more aggressive. Most of it is caused by genetics, but stress can also play a huge factor as well. Another point to say is that hairloss definitely plays a part in self-confidence to some degree. No matter who you are it can be quite a shock to accept the hand you've been dealt with.

Considering this, theres no way there are idols that arent balding to some degree, right? And I'm sure we all know that there are a few idols that do have the look, but it definitely isn't the majority. What do you think goes on behind the scenes with regards haircare and other related things? Like maybe companies screen for these things before selecting idols, if its even possible to do so?

It would be interesting to hear your thoughts and knowledge.",51,120

I was watching a Q&amp;A by an ex-idol about the ISAC and wanted to see some old footage of it. I found link this in the comments, the introduction video from 2010 ISAC. 
https://youtu.be/OVpfCCVjL6s

Leetuk taking oath, 2pm saying they want to rival 2am. SuJu, f(x) SHINee and Trax on the same time. Many groups I haven't really heard of. The starship ent team was only sistar and K.will. 2am and Lee Hyun on the same team. The JYP team walking in with charisma and applause. I think 9muses, secret, infinte and MBLAQ also got a lot of cheers when they walked into the parade with flags.

What does r/kpop feel about the ISAC now and do you have any memories to share about the old ISAC days? ISAC (is it pronounced Isaac) lost its relevance? Rigged to make big names stand out? Do YG groups participate? I guess rookies really want to try out for screentime but I feel like I didn't see a lot of famous rookies take part this year.",8,21

But I love diversity in dance styles, and I find it exciting when dancers of the same group have completely different styles and techniques but perform together really well and harmoniously. For example, in TWICE, Momo (hip hop and urban dance) and Mina (ballet and modern dance) have, in my opinion, one of the greatest dance chemistries in Kpop, despite being so different from one another. What are other groups that have this as well?",0,1

[Mystic White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIDcCOC-vdo) was centered around a cute-ish concept and consisted of Bora (Sistar), Lizzy (After School/Orange Caramel), Sunhwa (Secret), Gayoon (4Minute), and Jiyoung (KARA).

[Dazzling Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOnAVn6iRf8) was a sexy concept and consisted of Hyorin (Sistar), Nana (After School/Orange Caramel), Hyuna (4Minute), Hyosung (Secret), and Nicole (KARA).

Now that most of these groups have disbanded or moved on, I'm curious to see who you would include if a project like this happened in 2019! 

All of these members were from smaller companies (no 'big 3' idols) and all groups were active at the time, so same criteria applies. No one underage!

My picks\^\^:

Mystic White: 

* Sunhwa &gt;&gt; Eunha (GFriend)
* Lizzy &gt;&gt; Bomi (Apink)
* Gayoon &gt;&gt; Sejeong (Gugudan)
* Bora &gt;&gt; Mijoo (Lovelyz)
* Jiyoung &gt;&gt; Yves (LOONA)

Dazzling Red: 

* Hyorin &gt;&gt; Solar (Mamamoo)
* Hyosung &gt;&gt; Seolhyun (AOA)
* Hyuna &gt;&gt; Somin (KARD)

2592,2019-09-22,2019,9,22,4,d7eu5l,"Do you think ""international outreach"" is what will define the 4th gen?",Camerroneously,1569093289,"I've recently started thinking about this more, because it feels undoubtable that we're now at the very start of the 4th gen with groups like Itzy, TXT, LOONA, IZ*ONE, and others debuting and securing their own footholds. It made me wonder what will be the defining thing to separate it from the 3rd gen, and I think companies focusing pushing more for worldwide popularity is it.

My reasons:

- Every generation has built off the last. The 1st gen laid the groundwork for the idol system, 2nd gen saw the rise of popular groups with mass public and fandom appeal, 3rd gen revived physicals, strengthened fandom, and showed that kpop can reach beyond Asia and make a decent impact on the West. I think 4th gen will see more globally popular groups rising and be taken seriously as musical acts instead of being a novelty.

- More girl groups are debuting and coming back with more Western-friendly styles. I specified girl groups here just because their fandom power is weaker than boy groups, who will likely sell 30-50k and tour earlier than the girls will.

Don't get me wrong, this is definitely in response to the pendulum swinging to crush concepts for a few years now, but the timing is excellent. Doing girl/teen crush performs better to non Asian audiences than bright/cute concepts, the exceptions being if it can be memed (poor Momoland) or if it has what I call the ""F(x)/Red Velvet experimental yet sophisticated component"" (like GWSN's very deep house inspired tracks with all the weird synths they use). 

ITZY, (G)-Idle, and Everglow debuted right off the bat with crush concepts and have gotten popular off them. I'm interested to see how long this will hold before cute becomes the trend again, and if they'll still see the same explosive success.

- More foreign events. Seemed like every group had a U.S./Canada tour at the beginning of the year, and the Europe and South American dates I saw also did well. I think companies will make these places a regular part of groups' touring rotation, and will probably send groups touring earlier. ATEEZ debuted, got popular, and was sent around the world 6 months into debut; we'll probably see similar schedules from more groups that can afford it.

Within Asia, there's IZ*ONE that was made specifically to be a Korea/Japan group (following in Twice's footsteps it seems), and ~~Super Junior-M~~ ~~EXO-M~~ WayV is SM's (latest) attempt at the Chinese market. This aspect has been ongoing since the 1st gen, though. It's really the Western push that I think will develop more.

- Content accessibility is higher than ever. Youtube, Vlive, and Insta Live are great for fans to connect with groups, and I've seen more companies including English subs or allowing community subs on their videos.

So that's what I think! I definitely want to hear what other people think, because it will definitely be interesting to see how much further kpop will reach before it plateaus (if it even does!)",56,64

**Q: You guys have run to New York right after you've finished promotions for your album. What are your thoughts about it?**

**Seulgi**: Amongst the 3 albums we're releasing this year, we've completed Day 1 and Day 2, but it's not a complete end yet because there is still Day 3 left to be released. We have to practice and shoot the Music Video when we go back to Korea. While promoting Day 1 and Day 2, I think I've learnt the method on how to have a relaxed mind. Before that, I was always sensitive with nervousness, but this time was different. Therefore, it's a special promotion.

**Wendy**: Because the title song for Day 1 'Zimzalabim' is a new attempt (for us), I worried a lot about the dance and song during the preparation stage. But as we actually really started promotions, it's good. If I think back about it now, I don't think there's any point I have big regrets about.

**Q: I think it must have been very tiring physically.**

**Seulgi**: Of course, we were busy. Even though there weren't a lot of spare time between Day 1 and Day 2, on the contrary, my mind was at ease, unlike previously. I was able to carry out the promotions as planned, and able to progress ahead while thinking about fine details meticulously.

**Wendy**: It is true that I felt a little burdened while thinking that I have to complete everything in that short amount of time and show perfection. Even if it's just a little, I hope that while listening to the album, many people are able to recognize that it's a genre that can be digested because it's Red Velvet, and that because it's Red Velvet, that such diverse songs and albums can be shown consecutively like this.

**Q: You guys feel composed in every way now.**

**Seulgi**: Now when we go to broadcasting stations, we are one of the seniors. When I watch the juniors perform during rehearsals, I think, 'Ah, so cute'. I thought 'We had those kinds of days too' and sometimes get surprised. (laughs)

**Wendy**: For me, I hope that this composure is not felt only by us. As much as we've become more relaxed, I hope that the people listening to our music can enjoy them while feeling relaxed too.

**Q: This is the 6th year into your debut. What do you feel when you look back?**

**Wendy**: From time to time, there were regretful things. There are also moments or periods that I would like to go back to. But it is impossible to go back. I think those times have all become experiences. Now that we have debuted a little over 5 years, I think Red Velvet has found our own color. Just looking at our album this time round, although 'Zimzalabim' is new and is a song that receives different reactions based on preferences, I think the second album 's 'Umpah Umpah' is a song that anyone would be able to listen to comfortably. We plan to enjoy ourselves at attempting diverse attempts in the future, just as we are now.

**Seulgi**: I sometimes watch videos that fans had made and thought 'I've worked hard at attempting diverse things.' I feel proud when I look at organized data from different concepts. When I look at my past self, I felt that I was fresh, and I could feel the process of me finding individuality through the different eras over the past 5 years, thus it felt different. Compared to my rookie days, I'm showing each individuality and concept more distinctively. I think the past 5 years was a time for me to gradually know myself better.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Compared to the number of years you have debuted, you guys still feel fresh like rookies. I think it's thanks to us trying new attempts?**

**Seulgi**: Though it is not an easy thing to always show different sides to ourselves every single time, within the different concepts, we work hard on trying to portray sides of the 5 members which are different from before. Of course, there were also difficult times. Therefore, I sometimes think, 'We worked really hard'. The outcome is very rewarding as well.

**Wendy**: When I came to realize that we've actually debuted for over 5 years, I couldn't believe it. It's because time has flown super quickly. Actually, even when it comes to our 10th anniversary, I don't think I'll feel it's realistic. I think when that time comes, I'll be thinking, 'Haven't we only debuted for about 5 years?'

**Q: Have you imagined about what you'd be like during your 10th anniversary?**

Amongst ourselves, there are some times where we try to portray what we'd be like in 10 years. While looking at Fin.K.L sunbaenims reminiscing about their old days and talk about them, I thought, 'We'll also talk about frivolous memories just like them right?' I don't think there will be any huge difference from now. Also, we've gained this much composure in our 5th year now, so I think broadcasting stations might feel even more relaxing to us at that time? It'll totally feel like my house, right?

**Q: Are you generous in complimenting yourself?**

**Wendy**: Up till now, I've thought that if I always comfort myself, I will not be able to develop and will become relaxed. I tell myself, 'No, it's not all right yet'. But that kind of attitude has kept me trapped over and over again. Therefore, now I neither compliment nor criticize myself.

**Seulgi**: I just try to work hard faithfully in the time given to me. To have a sense of responsibility and not be conceited. I think I just have to perform a perfect stage till I reach the extent where I can be praised. Instead of being frustrated, I work hard preparing thoroughly. I compliment myself on the stages where I've put in my best.

**Q: What do you do when your heart feels tired and exhausted?**

**Wendy**: When I feel myself getting disheveled, I brace myself at places like fan meetings, or I read fan letters. I will then be able to remember precious things that I've forgotten briefly and be full spirited immediately.

**Seulgi**: I talk the most to the members. Because the members feel similar emotions as I do. I think we are able to overcome it if we console each other. Thinking about it, before when we were sensitive or when our moods are down, I am the type to keep quiet and just watch and wait. But these days, I'll release (the tension) by joking around while nudging them and laughing. Is this also evidence of me gaining composure?

**Q: Who is the one in charge of wit in the group?**

**Seulgi**: I think Yeri is the most interesting. Yeri is the type whom you'd want to joke with.

**Q: How do you guys usually balance your life?**

**Seulgi**: After schedules end, I have my own break time. I meet my friends and eat yummy food. I also enjoy my own free time in between schedules like during waiting time or when we're moving to another location. I mainly watch movies or listen to music.

**Q: What do you think is the reason why Seulgi and Wendy are cast in this photoshoot?**

**Wendy**: Chemistry between the people born in 1994? Also, there hasn't been any place that contains the story of just the two of us up till now, I think this is an opportunity to contain a new feeling of us.

**Seulgi**: When we first met, I thought that there is not a single thing that is common between us. But as we got to know each other, I found out that although the environment where we grew up in is different, our parents have similar propensities. Therefore, our values are also similar. Sometimes we (are/do things that are) exactly the same, as if we've planned it before hand, that I got surprised. I think those similar parts have an influence.

**Q: If you guys are born in 1994, that means you're 25 years old. I'm curious about the different sensibilities and values the two of you have.**

**Seulgi**: I think this is the most interesting age. Not sure if it's indirect experience from looking at my parents' generation, I have sensibilities in both analog and digital, and hence I can relate to both sides. Personally, I think that the age 25 is the most important period in life. I think it's also the age where you have to be responsible.

**Wendy**: Though it's the best age, depending on how you spend it, I think the whole of your 30s can change. Though I want to do well at everything, I may get stress if I exhaust all my energy in trying too hard to do well. Therefore, these days, I've resolved to spend every single day faithfully and interestingly. If I accumulate those days, I wonder if I will be able to become a better me.

**Q: Are there any topics you guys have personally these days?**

**Wendy**: I want to be able to sing better as time goes by and I want to be acknowledged. I think I'm still far in that aspect. I feel more that way every time I sing. Though I feel very happy when I sing, I think that I have to work even harder if I want to do well.

**Q: How did the weather in New York welcome the two of you?**

**Wendy**: Somehow, I feel freer. I think I got a stronger impression because we came during the fashion week period. There are many people nicely dressed in fine clothes. I can't help but feel excited with the feeling that we've joined in on this kind of space.

**Seulgi**: I think I've properly learnt about the attractiveness of New York. Up till now, I didn't know that this is such a fun city. It's interesting just looking at the styles of the people passing by. Because they have distinct individualities, it is fun just to watch.

**Q: Is there anything you'd like to say to each other?**

**Seulgi**: I've appeared on variety programs with Wendy before, but it's the first time we're doing a photoshoot together, so I'm anticipating how the photos will look like. It feels like I've come on a vacation with Wendy. The pretty photos are add-ons. I think this will stay in my memories for a long long time.

**Wendy**: It feels like coming on a vacation-like vacation after a busy period. It's relaxing and free. Everything is to my liking. As such, I'm anticipating the outcome a lot. It's even more relaxing and fun because I'm with Seulgi. I think it'll become an unforgettable memory for me.

But I enjoy diversity in dancers, especially when they're in the same group and how well they dance together.

A great example is in TWICE, where Momo's specialty is hip hop and urban dance, and Mina's is ballet and modern dance. They're both really flexible and versatile when it comes to exploring each other's styles, and in my opinion, have one of the greatest dance chemistries in Kpop. Every stage they share together, they POP OFF.

What are other groups that also have this? And are there dancers who specialise in other styles apart from those that I mentioned?",55,100

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d4orzu/nugu_roundup_11_cant_see_the_forest_for_the_stars/).

Since it's Sunday, which matches their fandom name, and they just had an ah-mah-zing comeback, let's get to know Saturday!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Saturday**

**Who are they?:** A five member girl group under SD Entertainment.  The group has had 6-7 members in the past, but four members have left and two new members have been added since debut.

**Company:** Hard to find much information about SD Entertainment.  Their website link on their official Twitter is broken (and their Twitter hasn't been updated in over a year), and it looks like they've set up another website which right now is only a photo of the Saturday members.  From what I can tell Saturday is their only group.

**Debut:** July 18th, 2018 with MMook Jji BBa ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4tJ1k7AP-o)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iltOgPZviks)) - A fun cute upbeat song with hints of Shinsadong Tiger and Momoland in the construction.  The song quotes the viral hit 'Gwiyomi' which was originally written by DanDi, who also produced this song (and much of the rest of Saturday's output).

**Most Recent Comeback:** September 19th, 2019 with BByong ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uamioRNrvQ4)) Showcase Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmrexZOoOZM)) A more mature sound, trending away from their previously cuter persona to a more teen-crush sound.  This is their first comeback since members Sion and former leader Chohee left the group.  This also marks their first physical album, a single album called 'IKYK' (I know you know) ([purchase link](https://www.amazon.com/SD-ENTERTAINMENT-Saturday-Photobook-2Photocard/dp/B07XP4TQJG/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=saturday+kpop+album&amp;qid=1569168711&amp;sr=8-1), Hanteo/Gaon certified)

**YouTube Channel:** [Saturday Official](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOWHtRSzgSyNA0MMkZdchJQ/videos)

**Other MVs and Live Performances:**

* All I Want For Christmas is You (Mariah Carey Cover) ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToUqMk8A7cE)) (features Sion and Sunha, no longer with the group)
* In Your Eyes ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4vRy-R7OI)) (featuring Yuki, Ayeon, and Haneul)
* Kiss Me ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAeQtKIXwM)) (featuring Chohee, no longer with the group)
* WiFi ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L8FXg8zbDA)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEqVnPA14tU)) Another Shinsadong/Momoland-esque song, but another bop as well (also produced by DanDi).  Upon release their company didn't have enough money to promote them on many music shows, so they used a Makestar campaign to raise funds for further promotion, succeeding and re-promoting the song (with a member change from Sunha to Minseo) more recently ([Recent performance link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71kr73121t8))
* Superbad Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXRAM9WKx74)) The second track from their 'Follow Saturday' digital album (which featured WiFi as the title track) A fun retro song with some rockabilly vibes
* Gwiyomi Song ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYumUDNryjw)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg5lGFi_TJ0)) A cover of the song originally performed by Hari, but written by Saturday's main producer DanDi.

Last week was a special themed anniversary Jukebox, with artists such as Brown Eyed Girls, NCT Dream, Wonder Girls, and more! Technically, the highest rated song last week was Wonder Girl's Why So Lonely, but we've already seen this song on Jukebox before. So, the highest rated songs of last week were __GFriend's Rainbow__ with a score of **8.83** and __Red Velvet's Umpah Umpah__ with a score of **8.80**, both of which achieved all-kill's! Congrats to all three girl groups for knocking it out of the park last week!

Last week, u/tutetibiimperes correctly guessed 2 of the themes and, as a reward, got to choose the Artist Spotlight and spotlighted artist's songs for this week! Introducing the outstanding soloist and vocalist from Brown Eyed Girls, __this week's spotlighted artist is Gain!__ Are you ready for some sensually delightful and elegant songs? Here's the line-up for this week!

1. [MV] [Gain - Paradise Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i32ANEa5mk)
2. [Key - One of These Nights (feat. Crush)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3BIQyLqTqI)
3. [TWICE - Yes or Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAKsZ26SabQ)
4. [Gain - Carnival (The Last Day)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXHJQ7CYqQM)
5. [EXO - Gravity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prFir9hRSxU)
6. [Gain - Tinkerbell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3BIQyLqTqI)
7. [CLC - Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4qnUGwWIU)

Here's the rules! Each week there are seven songs up to review on Jukebox. Listen to the song(s) you want to review and then leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song(s) in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song is not something you'd say Yes to twice, and 10 being this is a song has got you trapped in its Gravity! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you may use the music video to inform your overall score for the song  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

You can keep reviewing songs until this Saturday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your reviews and comments in by then!

As a result, sadly, I know only the mainstream songs of some of the groups out there.

So, my question is: which song/MV/performace literally awed you? Left you speechless? Which one gives you goosebumps? What is your absolute *absolute* favourite?

As for me, I might be biased (but tbh, who isn't when it comes to our favourites) but i love *love* **love** the ['IDOL' Special Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayGl-igrwy8) from the 2018 MMa. I've watched the intros a hundred times, and there's something in the ""traditional"" rhythm that makes my heart beat faster and makes me very happy.

2857,2019-09-24,2019,9,24,1,d892ev,Attending my first fansign ever! (Everglow 190922 +Album Giveaway),NishinosanTV,1569256898,"Hi, I am Sander from Omona Norway, I'm one of the people who worked on having Norway's biggest K-pop concert in Oslo back in June. We had Momoland, Monsta X, Jang Jane and Giant Pink attend. Currently I'm living in Seoul and studying Korean.

So where to begin this? I got a notification from a twitter fansign account last week that said that Everglow was going to have a fansign this Sunday and that you had to buy your albums at a certain music store in ETLAND in Yongsan. I've never attended a fansign before, so that was an experience that I wanted to have. Everglow also didn't require (at this time) that many albums to get in.

I went to the music store in Yongsan on Thursday last week. I bought 10 albums and the clerk gave me a receipt where I had to write down my name, date of birth as well as phone number. I handed that receipt back to him. I was anxious as there has been other fansigns where you keep this written receipt and show it on the day of the fansign. This wasn't the case for this one, I only needed to bring my ID if I got picked.

Had to wait until Saturday 11 PM KST to know if I got a spot at the fansign. [I got in.](https://imgur.com/1BZSPIY)

On the day of the fansign I travelled alone. I went around 16:00 from where I currently live in Seoul, around the Sangwangsimni area. I tried chatting with the people from the Everglow discord to see if there were any others attending. There was only one other but that person had to arrive late to the fansign, so I had to travel solo. The fansign was going to be inside a hall inside ETLAND in Yongsan Electronics Market. Finding the hall was actually a struggle, felt it was a little hidden inside ETLAND. Had to go up to the music store to ask where it was, luckily they were helpful.

Found the [Land Hall](https://imgur.com/TiivgS5) on the 2nd floor. They had set up a [little desk](https://imgur.com/5zc6hZz) where you could check in. They check your name on the list and cross check with your ID. The check-in was smooth, but since I have a long name IRL they couldn't figure out who I was, so I had to point out my name on their list. After checking you pick a random seat from a box (see previous picture, the black box). [I got seat 30](https://imgur.com/tlY5wIQ).

They now started allowing us to enter the hall itself. So, I'm a complete stranger to people here, so I get some weird looks by some people. Many of the people that attended this fansign seems like regulars, they chatted freely with each other, bring massive cameras and swap seat numbers with ease. [I got to my seat and waited.](https://imgur.com/lFZ0Fu9) I felt like I had a very decent view from where I was sitting.

The clock ticked 19:00 and the girls came out. The girls looked great, and personally, I think Mia stole the show for the evening, she looked amazing! They did a quick greeting to everyone and sat down. The clerk from the music store started with the front line, and they queued up on the left. [Here's what the start looked like.](https://imgur.com/KUU8cIw) The clerk spoke in Korean, so naturally I had no idea what he said. I asked a guy sitting next to me to translate, which he kindly did!

The line slowly passes, many fanboys screaming the members name to get a pose or reaction for the camera. Okay, for just a moment, imagine [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U9kSo6BcjU). I had a fan like that sitting right in front of me yelling out Aisha's name. I was fine with it for the first few minutes but it got tiresome to listen to it after a while.

The clerk announces that my line can stand up and get in the queue. Remember I talked about cameras? I'll provide two pictures here. [This one](https://imgur.com/sk5vgmh) and [this one.](https://imgur.com/9PwsOEX) This, I gotta be honest, shocked me. I kinda felt bad for the girls as well but I guess this is normal.

Now, before I got into what we talked about, let it be known that it's not expected that they should know and understand English, but I sadly just didn't know enough Korean to have a conversation going. I kept my words simple and they also did a few Korean words here and there that I picked up.

I got up to talk with E:U first, told her that I wanted my album signed at the front. Apparently this is something that's not normal / allowed at other groups fansigns? But she went along with it. I told E:U that Everglow is really loved in Norway and that they have many fans wishing for them to come soon. She was really humbled and hoped that they would at least come to Europe in the future.

Aisha was next, and, what was lacking in English was overpayed in emotions, high fives and smiles. She was really kind and took the time to listen to what I had to say. Next up was Onda, she was surprised to see a Norwegian coming to the fansign, and was really thankful that I chose to come to their fansign. Sihyeon was next, she surprised me, she was really good at speaking English. She was also very humbled that Norway had so many Everglow fans.

Yiren was really nice and sweet. I could tell it was difficult for her talking English, but you could tell she tried hard. She was also surprised to see a Norwegian come to their fansign, but hoped to see me again someday. Last one up was Mia, and I gotta be honest, I think I've been wrecked, not only was she super nice and sweet to me, but she was overjoyed and happy that I came to their fansign, and promised me to come to Norway one day to have a concert. She was also shocked to hear that there's fans in Norway that are so big fans of Everglow. I thanked her for her time and stood up.

I smiled back to my seat. So the question though is, what do you do after you're done with signing the album? I ended up sitting back down at my seat and watching the members greet fan by fan. What I really admire about Everglow is that they were constantly cheerful when a new fan sat down to talk to them, you couldn't tell that they were tired or bored at all. It really did seem like they had fun.

I think the fansign lasted for about two hours. When they finished their signing Onda quickly exited for something. The rest of the [members went to the front](https://imgur.com/ibBB7Yn) to talk about some variety stuff. I think they said that they really wanted to do a game with us, but since we didn't have that much time left they weren't able to. Instead, Onda came out after she did a wardrobe change and gave us a fierce dance performance to Dua Lipa - New Rules.

They all greeted us one final time, thanked us for participating and hoped to see us again in the future.

Travelled back home and struggled with sleeping, so I started working on this fan account.

I've got two spare Everglow albums that I'm giving away. If you want to, head on over to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sanderbraekke) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/sanderbraekke). If you wanna follow my adventure with agencies or general life in Seoul, it could be interesting to check out my IG. To enter, just pop down a comment below in this thread, and I'll draw a random winner. I'll get in touch with you at the end of October. We've got a hectic October coming up, with lots of rule changes as well as some of our biggest AMAs yet (if everything goes according to plan!), so bear with me and us.

Thanks for reading my fan account!

I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back on thursday night for update!

2927,2019-09-24,2019,9,24,15,d8jhzc,"We all know that the biggest trinity of agencies are SM, JYP &amp; YG (or Big Hit), but do you have your own special favorite trinity of agencies?",SeasonAndTime,1569308001,"If we were asked to name the biggest trinity of agencies in Kpop, our most immediate answer would be SM, JYP and YG (or Big Hit because of how much of a decline YG is in right now). But do you have your own favorite big 3 of agencies? I'll state mine for example.

My favorite trinity of Kpop labels would be **Antenna**, **Mystic** and **Shofar**. They all release Kpop that is really aren't mainstream in terms of us international fans, but my goodness do they ever deliver. Usually when I try to buy songs digitally, I only buy really good title songs of an album just to save money. But when it comes from these agencies, I buy the whole album digitally because the side tracks are just that marvelous and it's right up in my alley.

**Antenna** is notable for having Lee Jin Ah, Sam Kim, Kwon Jin Ah, Jung Seung Hwan and Chai. They've all been through the survival show, ""Kpopstar"", and Yoo Huiyeol (CEO and a legendary songwriter) took them in and trained them real good in terms of vocals and songwriting. Their voices are pure eardrum-healers and the lyrics that they write are heart-warming, beautiful and so relatable. They usually collaborate together on making songs or special videos that really shares the sentiments through music. Love them all.

**Mystic**'s well known artists are Minseo, Park Jaejung, Brown Eyed Girls (plz comeback) and Yoon Jong Shin. Yoon Jong Shin releases a top quality song EVERY MONTH. His lyrics are insanely good and his singing is still insanely phenomenal at an age of 50. One of the best (or probably the best) lyricist in Korean music, Kim Eana, is also in Mystic. She writes songs for great musicians; the ones in Antenna, Park Hyoshin and musicians from her own label. Minseo and Park Jaejung have lovely voices and they have so much potential to be great singers in the industry. Also, Mystic is preparing a girl group with strong contenders of Kim Suhyun, Lee Soomin &amp; Takeuchi Miyu, and since it's from Mystic I'm very interested on how it's going to shape up.

**Shofar** is definitely an indie paradise, with their main star definitely being BOL4. Woo Jiyoon and Ahn Jiyoung are fabulous musicians that create amazing songs that make you repeat over and over again. I also recently discovered these indie artists from the label: Sweden Laundry and Vanilla Acoustic. Their indie sounds have really addictive melodies and lyrics are so beautifully written; if you look at the translations you will be feeling mixed emotions and I can assure you that.

So if you do have your own trinity of Kpop labels, what is yours?",32,9

Walaupun kini hanya berjumlah 8 orang member, grup boyband ini tetap mampu berlaga di kancah dunia entertainment dan menghibur para penggemarnya di seluruh dunia. EXO selalu sukses memikat hati para penggemar dengan suara yang dipadukan dengan seni tari yang terlihat macho. Ya, siapa yang tak leleh melihat bias mereka menari dengan penuh energi di atas panggung? Tak mengherankan jika [tiket EXO](https://www.blibli.com/promosi/tivo-exploration-exo) hampir selalu terjual penuh. Tak terkecuali saat tour konser mereka yang ke-empat bertajuk The EyXiOn. Konser yang diadakan pada tahun 2017 ini diselenggarakan di tiga kota terbesar di Asia, yaitu Kota Seoul, Kota Jepang, dan Bangkok. Saat itupun, puluhan juta fans EXO beli tiket EXO secara serempak, sehingga tiket yang terjual pun habis dalam hitungan menit! Bisa ditebak bahkan situs yang jual tiket EXO pun tak jarang down akibat serbuan serentak yang diluncurkan EXO-L. Para fans mengungkapkan bahwa konser ini merupakan salah satu konser terbaik dan fenomenal yang pernah diselenggarakan. Terbukti dengan adanya kelanjutan konser The EyXiOn encore yang diselenggarakan di dua kota, yaitu Seoul dan Macau.",1,0

Also going off of season 1, it should be members of the current top girl groups, even though no one from 2ne1 joined. And despite having 7 idols, season 1 only had 6 groups, but I'll include 7 groups for this one.

I'd add the ones I find really hilarious or entertaining: Momo (Twice), Jisoo (Blackpink), Joy (Red Velvet), Yerin (Gfriend), Solar (Mamamoo), Yena (IZ\*ONE) and Mijoo (Lovelyz). Dear lord, imagine the absolute CHAOS.

From Twice to IZ\*ONE, I'd say it's a lock-in for the top girl groups, but I had a tough time deciding whether to include Lovelyz or not, since there are other popular or trending groups such as (G)-Idle and Itzy, or perhaps even WJSN or Oh My Girl. So feel free to include another group.",3,5

I'm curious of the styles of the song, the line distribution (if it's better or worse), the styling, and the choreo of their songs. It's mainly because mostly in the group are dancers so it's already given. Also, vocal-wise, there's not enough singers and I'm curious how Baekhyun and Taemin are gonna handle the vocals. Baekhyun being the leader too is new so I'm very excited how he's gonna lead them.",34,15

#Pronunciation Guide

As we know from the survey, not a ton of us are Korean experts (omo~ ). We usually have help from the native speaker on the team, but she's busy and this is a tight turnaround, so I'm taking a hack at it myself. Fortunately, this is a pretty easy song, but go ahead and think of this more as a *rhythm* guide than a true *pronunciation* guide, because I'm a white girl from Texas who barely speaks English and is just doing her best.

I've tried to follow our jelly's guides to the vowel sounds and keep it as close to her patterns as possible, but please do forgive me for any glaring mistakes. The guide to YOU AND I is below, romanized with emphasized syllables bolded. It should be fairly intuitive, but always shout out with questions. Hopefully it makes any sense at all. Good luck :X

I was interested in which girl groups came back the most and the least often, and who actually has claim to be the most jaded girl group fandom.  

Now you might think that answer is obvious, but as it turns out, step back Blackpink, there is a new sheriff in town:

______________________________________________

Now a couple of things about the data:

*  These are all the currently active girl groups I could think of that had at least 4 releases since debut (in order to have a decent sized set of data).  If I missed any, please let me know and I will add them.

*  I am only counting Korean releases and I am counting multiple singles released at one time (IE Blackpink's Boobayah and Whistle) as 1 release since they are promoted at the same time.

*  I am not as familiar with some of these groups, so there is a possibility that I may have counted an extra release wasnt promoted or missed a release that was a special release and was promoted.  If you see any errors like that, please let me know so I can make corrections.

_________________________________________________

Now what does this show us?:

*  As expected, Twice is a machine and leads in comeback frequency, but what I found interesting is that G-idle is one their way to quite the blistering rate themselves.  I guess we will have to see how long they sustain that.

*  I fully expected Blackpink at the bottom of this list, but as it turns out, Dan-jjak have slightly more claim to comeback frequency complaints than Blinks do.  I will give Apink a pass here because they are an older group and comebacks drastically slow the older a group gets.  But Gugudan and BP are literately comparable age wise, so this was interesting to me.

*  I also found it quite interesting that the middle of the pack has a very small range of time between them.  It seems that around 150 days per comeback is pretty normal for girl groups.

Kpop is korean music, it doesnt need western success.",heyheymonika1,1569383515,"Dont expect kpop to be taking over western music anytime soon or at all. Im happy for the few groups like BTS who managed to get success here but its not everything. I can still support my groups knowing theyll never have western success and thats okay, the general public in the US doesnt really care about kpop besides bts (and even then they still dont care). Yes they made history with their achievements but Im not gonna put those expectations on other groups. Its not fair to them, America isnt everything. I rather have my groups be successful in Korea first than America because we all know how it ends when groups mainly focus on the west. It falls fast. 

I guess my point of this rant is for the kpop fans who are so eager for their groups to debut here or acting like your group cant succeed without the west when that simply isnt true. Korea is kpops biggest market because duh its korean music. Kpop doesnt need the west to survive. Even when this western fad ends, kpop will still be thriving elsewhere. Western success isnt everything. Just continue to support your groups no matter what and please dont pin groups against each other. Yes, bts did well but that doesnt mean every group needs to follow in their steps or that theyll even come close to that peak. 

I dont have high hopes for SuperM but Im excited to see my favorite members working together. Even though the US most likely wont care, Ill still support them and the same goes for all the kpop groups I stan. Stop focusing on the west.",7,1

Twice is most probably one of if not the most recognizable (by look and sound) in terms of current gen GGs but JYPE still have the need to have the 'Feel Special' MV advertised on even non-related videos (I assume due to the algorithms YouTube use to show you ads related to the content you see).

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

## Why are western / non k-pop songs shown?
Right now there is not a reliable way to discern k-pop from non k-pop songs since the genre casts a pretty wide net. We've also found that a good number of people enjoy seeing the crossovers, so for all songs will be shown.

3176,2019-09-26,2019,9,26,4,d98cwu,Why are so many kpop fans racist to Koreans? Does anybody else notice this?,Garlicgr,1569440236,"Seriously, just look at the comments of BTS performing at a Women's Basketball Awards a couple years ago. 

https://youtu.be/4Gu5i2kdL9w 

The level of ignorance (Koreans are so boring, Americana and blacks actually appreciate music) and even cruelty (""I want to punch those Koreans in the face for not enjoying it"") that gets approval and agreement is wild.

Honestly, even non-kpop content gets flooded with really mind-boggling comments by users with kpop idol names and profile pictures. Hello Counselor videos, which often feature the very Korean hosts and audience showing sympathy to  guests who have suffered prejudice or mistreatment, get comments that ignore nuance and go straight to criticizing all Koreans as some sort of homogeneous, uniformly close-minded people that hates all ""_____"" people.

There's also the common idea that I see on here that Koreans ""didn't appreciate this group, now they must regret it, international fans were the ones to appreciate them"" as if all Koreans collectively decided on who to support. That's how it works in literally any entertainment industry anywhere- some people just don't get famous for a while, or get less recognition than fans would want for them. And of course MCs or shows aren't going to focus so much on the smaller groups- it may not be kind or ""right,"" but it happens to every group that isn't on top, and isn't out of some weird cultural desire to see your favorite group in particular fail.

It's just really frustrating and even alienating to try to navigate kpop and variety content as a Korean and then see all these ignorant comments and opinions against a whole, complex culture, and then to see all the upvotes. I know that these comments are usually coming from people who may be young or only focused on their favorite idols, but it doesn't change the fact that it sucks to see and really sours my view on foreign kpop fans who post hateful and inaccurate comments about the very culture and people that their beloved idols come from.

TL;DR I see a lot of ignorant and racist comments against Koreans by kpop fans, and wonder if anybody else has noticed this as well.",36,10

It seems like this kind of data might be something that interests the sub and I am a data junkie.  I come from traditional sports so I love statistics and pouring over spreadsheets.  As such, I would like to start a monthly series that tracks a bunch of numbers in the Kpop scene.  But I need your input!

First of all, I would like to keep the girl group list in my other post, but also add a list of boy groups as well tracking the same numbers.  I might also add days since last comeback in the tracking as well.

Outside of this, I would be open and interested in tracking out data you guys might be interested in seeing every month.

______________________________________________

#What I need from you:
_______________________________________________

**Boy Group List**

I dont know active boy groups all that well, so in order to make sure that the list is complete and accurate, I ask for any help anyone is willing to provide in compiling a list of currently active boy groups that have AT LEAST 3 comebacks NOT including their debut.  Any help people are willing to provide would be incredibly appreciated.

__________________________________________________

**What do you want to see**

Outside of average days per comeback and maybe days since last comeback, what data would you be interested in seeing tracked monthly?  I cant guarantee I will have the resources or the ability to track everything as sometimes resources are spotty on some information, especially for smaller groups, but I will try my best if its something people are really interested in.

______________________________________________

**My Ultimate Goal**

Its always been a dream of mine to have a compiled database on as many groups as I can that tracks debuts, comebacks, variety appearances, sales, ect. all in one place and quarry-able.  One of the hardest things for international fans is to find is all the information they want about groups and releases in one place.  I would like to attempt to provide such a resource.

#Girl Group Post Update

_____________________________________________

A key mistake in my post was pointed out to me by someone on discord.  I was counting debuts as a release, but if I am tracking comeback averages, I need to not count them since its like starting a group with one comeback in the calculations.  As such, I have updated the table factoring in this new methodology:

Group | Debut Date (MM/DD/YYYY) | Releases | Days Since Debut | Average Days Between Releases | 
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
Twice | 10/20/2015 | 11 | 1436 | 131 | 
Red Velvet | 8/1/2014 | 12 | 1881 | 157 |

Apink | 4/19/2011 | 12 | 3081 | 257 | 
Blackpink | 8/8/2016 | 4 | 1143 | 286 | 

As you can see it did change the rankings a bit and Blackpink has even reclaimed their throne over Apink.  So yay?

_____________________________________________

Also, some people had an issue with me including the the time between groups' last comeback in the calculations since its not an accurate measurement of full time between 2 comebacks.  I think this time is important because groups with very long times between comebacks will benefit from not factoring this in, but that benefit will go away immediately if they came back tomorrow.  At the same time I understand it does give an ""advantage"" to groups that just recently came back as well.  As such, I have created a separate table with time since last comeback removed for those interested:

Group | Debut Date (MM/DD/YYYY) | Releases | Days Since Debut | Last Comeback | Days Since Last comeback | Average Days Between Releases | 
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

As you can see this was incredibly advantageous for a lot of groups.  Not sure how I feel about the data like this since you can obviously see how some of those groups will drastically drop the next time they come back, but I am interested to hear what you guys think.",18,93

Here's some conspiracy theories that I've heard or come up with

 Before Big Hit Plus Global Audition (global audition for girl group), when all of bighit's audition are for boys only, Bighit actually already did auditions for girls but privately not in public so that it won't causes chaos. They already trained some girls for the girl group and this new 2019 Plus Global Audition is just to pick 1 or 2 additional foreign members.

 JR was planned to lose in Produce 101 season 2 to save Nuest 

 I think this is more of like a fact but in Produce series companies pays mnet so that their trainee will get many screentime and nice editing (so his/her image will be good). Not only talent or visual, but companies and managers are also really important for a trainee's success in Produce series

 SM wanted the new girl group to be part of NCT (nct girl version). All of the girls are part of SMRookies and they've been close to NCT members since young, its like they'ce been trained together. It was never confirmed that NCT is only limited to boys, so in the future there can be a girl trainees added (as a nsw girl group) or as a co-ed group with existing NCT members

 Red Velvet debut was rushed to cover up scandal that was going on at that time

 Starship is lying about Wonho's age. He is actually older than Shownu. It is possible since Starship also lie about some Sistar member's age (I'm not sire but this is just what I heard)",11,5

But then, I liked Inuyasha. And BoA. So it was a blackhole which got me to Suju, Wonder Girls, SNSD, TVXQ... And now a days I prefere korean songs, besides understading japanese lyrics.

Also, after explaining some lyrics to my mom, she became a fan. So I was wondering if any of you had that hater/prejudice moment and what was so strong that made you even put you pride aside and say hey, thats kinda cool ... OMG I cant stop",47,30

But there have been some instances where I see a member of a group, think, ""Oh, that's the visual"", but then it isn't. I remember seeing Yeeun from CLC and I was surprised to find out that Yujin was the group's visual.

I don't want this to be a so and so member is prettier than this member, but I was just curious: when you first saw a group, who automatically caught your eye as The Visual? And also another thing I'd love to hear is, even if you didn't necessarily see why so and so member is the official member, why do you think they are?",78,31

&amp;#x200B;

\- groups that are rather successful (or have the potential to be successful) who haven't gotten comebacks in a while : the one that comes to mind is Golden Child. Woolim were pretty good about giving them comebacks their first year but it's been almost a year since Genie (the last song they actually promoted). I've seen their sales and I was surprised to see that they've been constantly gaining more and more fans with their last album selling 45k+. So why do you think they aren't giving them a comeback ? Could this be because they plan to debut a new bg ? But in this case why would this prevent him from giving GD a comeback anyway ? Have you examples of other groups in Golden Child's cases ?

&amp;#x200B;

\- the second thing I was thinking about is groups I stan that haven't had comebacks in a while but who aren't that successful : April is one of my favorite GG and it's true that they've gained quite a lot of attention with Oh My Mistake but they still haven't left Nuguland and their sales are pretty mediocre. Same thing for DIA (even though they had a comeback this year contrary to April). Do you think it's the company's duty to give groups in this situation comebacks even though they're not sure to gain profits from them ?

if a group you stan is in this situation, do you think the lack of success of this group is the reason they're not coming back or is there some other reason ? (members about to leave, company issues etc...)",67,37

If they are successful I feel like there is a possibility that entertainment companies will start experimenting with super groups by bringing together the most well known members of disbanded groups. An example might be a company taking a risk and taking well known members from disbanded groups like Pristin, Hello Venus, Nine Muses,Sistar and After School and trying to do something with them or similarly with boy groups. Its just a wild thought I figured might be something interesting to see in the future.

another idol that comes to mind when i think of being surprised of their popularity is mamamoo's hwasa. i stanned mmm in 2014-2015 and kind of stopped keeping up with them. hwasa was always crapped on from knetz back then so when i heard about how popular twit was i was very surprised. im not a moomoo though so im not very sure if she is the most popular member or not, but i was just surprised by her popularity.

3462,2019-09-27,2019,9,27,23,da1bg0,What factors contributed to some groups not becoming more successful,Armpit_Supermaniac,1569595002,"Looking at the recent past and some groups that have since disbanded, it is curious why some groups did not achieve greater success given their talent, concepts, discography, choreography, etc. 

As an example - 9Muses was an interesting case of a girl group that should have been more successful, but wasn't. 

Thinking about some of the reasons or stumbling blocks for 9Muses lack of success, in hindsight it ***might*** have been due to the following factors:

* Star Empire was a very poor company that mismanaged the group
* The documentary about their debut did little to endear the group to the public but instead painted a rather ugly picture of Star Empire and its leadership
* The repeated meme that their debut song ""No Playboy"" and their debut music show performance were flops
* The ""model idol"" concept was not embraced by the general public - statuesque former models turned idols
* The image projected by ""model idols"" was intimidating and not welcoming- male fans were not receptive to the kind of icy cool demeanor projected/female fans were given little to nothing to embrace or identify with members who channeled that model aesthetic
* 9Muses went through too many member changes in its first 3 years in losing and gaining members before stabilizing a bit in 2013
* 9Muses was a good example of a group that was more popular internationally than domestically with that international popularity not substantially having any impact on the groups success
* While 2013 was absolutely epic for 9Muses with 4 of their best releases in Dolls, Wild, Gun and Glue, the MV's and live performances did little to further the group's popularity despite the quality of the music
* The repeated extended hiatus periods over the span of the group's lifetime were career-killers. The 13 month hiatus between ""Gun"" in Dec. 2013 and ""Drama"" in Jan. 2015 and then again a 19 month hiatus between the release of ""Sleepless Night"" in Nov. 2015 and their comeback with ""Remember"" in June 2017 was a critical lost opportunity periods and caused any momentum the group had to fizzle and fade out
* In the final years of the 9Muses, the group was hemorrhaging members with 5 members leaving between 2014 and 2016 until ending as 4 member group of which only 1 member - Hyemi - was an original member

The above are all conjecture and supposition, but they seem to fit the circumstances. 

What are other examples of groups that should have been popular but that circumstances or other factors may have contributed to the their lack of popularity or success?",26,38

3512,2019-09-28,2019,9,28,11,daagi2,Predictions for Kpop in America 2020?,ShawnandAngela,1569638824,"A big push happened this year with lots of Kpop groups releasing music and doing festivals and performances for the American market. Even rookies are starting to get a foothold. But so far no group has succeeded in having their music attain real mainstream success like Gangnam Style did in 2012.

What's your prediction for this trend next year? Who do you see surprising you with their success or lack of success? Which groups can get a hit and how might they obtain that? What kind of moves will companies make and partnerships do you see arising from Korean and American labels? Do you see more collabs happening? More awards being won by different groups? Do you see the general public becoming excited about Kpop or do you think they'll just get tired? Will Kpop finally crack the mainstream or stay a niche or even a fad? Will the general public become open to it or will they get tired and annoyed?

I'm also curious about the possibility of globalization by localization. We've seen this in China with WayV and Boy Story. Produce Japan 101 and the Nizi Project as well. But what if an all Asian/Korean-American group is created by a company to capitalize on Kpop trends while incorporating Western norms more seamelessly than Kpop? Will this happen and do you see it working? And who might spearhead that project?",12,0

Idols from groups I am more heavily invested in and some groups I take a look at.

EXO - Xiumin, Baekhyun

Red Velvet - Seulgi

NCT - Yuta, Haechan, Renjun

BTS - Jimin, Jungkook

Blackpink - Rose, Jennie(?)

I would go into depth about these idols but it honestly would take a lot of time and be a wall of text lol.

Yes Dara did look super young for her age until she she hit 31 and now she aged pretty quickly. 

She looks like someone in their mid to late 30s now.

Especially here

You can see her age in her neck. She lost all her facial fat that made her look younger, and she has less skin elasticity.

Its weird when people say she looks 25 when she doesnt. Just because you look young for your age then doesnt mean you will keep looking young for your age. Salma Hayek looked old for her age as a teen but she barely aged much so she ended up looking young for her age even in her later 30s

Aging is a natural part of life and the aging rate depends on the individual. People who delude themselves in thinking Dara still looks like she is in her 20s probably grew up idolizing her as the  see its possible to never age girl...... But now are not taking it well because they starting to see the by product of a human being with DNA",1,0

As a gay Kpop fan, I can't help but wonder who within the Kpop industry may share a letter or two with me and other LGBTQ+ fans. Kpop seems to be an arena that, whether intentionally or  not, is very queer by design. Flashy numbers, glitzy, over the top costumes, impressive choreos (not to mention the queerbaiting of intimate same sex idol interactions), idol music almost seems like it is tailor made for queer fans, and quite a few of us call ourselves Kpop fans. 

Despite that, few, if any, idols themselves openly identify as queer themselves. I understand Korea is still quite conservative with regards to that, but with the continued pursuance of western acceptance, do we think that might change anytime soon? Holland is a big exception on the male side of things, but do we think other idols may feel free enough to come out soon? I really want to stan some queer idols gals, lol.",1,1

I've been to work on reformatting our AMA archive into looking a little more structured. 

One thing we wanted to work on here was to separate the AMAs done on this subreddit alone and K-Pop related AMAs done on separate subreddits into two separate tables. (Did you know we are reaching 50 AMAs on this subreddit alone?)

Let's get into details on what we've changed.

The format we used before was like this:

Date|Name|Occupation|Link|
--:|:--|:--|:--|
|190929| Kyla Massie | Artist | [Hi, I'm Kyla Massie! AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dakrgw/hi_im_kyla_massie_ama/)

And it's now been updated to this:
|/#|Date|Name|Occupation|AMA Thread|Announcement|
--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|48|190929|Kyla Massie|Artist|[Hi, I'm Kyla Massie! AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dakrgw/hi_im_kyla_massie_ama/)|[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d8rlv7/kyla_massie_expristin_will_be_doing_an_ama_on/)|

This gives us a numbering system and also a direct link to the announcement post for each AMA (Where it's applicable).

And as I've said, we've changed how you view AMAs done on separate subreddits, this is my current iteration. 

|Date|Name|Occupation|Link|Subreddit|
|--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|190614|DJ Swiwel|Arist|[Hey, r/bangtan I'm DJ Swiwel, AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/c0ddjn/hey_rbangtan_im_dj_swivel_ama/)|r/bangtan|

You'll see this at the bottom of the AMA archive. What would be helpful here is that if you can recall an AMA that has happened on other subreddits that is not in the AMA archive and let us know! We'll get them added if they are relevant enough! Example of threads here are PSYs AMAs on r/IAmA back when Gangnam Style was popular.

Would you like to see the changes? Check out the AMA archive [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/ama)",9,64

i know the law prevents 18-year olds from working past 10, so im curious as to why minju and yuri cant be on stage late too? i always thought it was because they were under 20, but with the X1 18 year olds on stage past 10 tonight, i was confused again!

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d7unek/nugu_roundup_12_sunday_funday_192209/).

After doing Saturday last Sunday I discovered that former member Chohee was friends with Saet Byeol of Girls' Alert, so from that tangent I discovered Girls' Alert, and it looks like they just had a comeback, so let's get to know them.

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Girls' Alert (also styled as GsA)**

**Who are they?:** A five member girl group under Roots Entertainment

**Company:** Girls' Alert is Roots Entertainment's only Kpop group, but they do represent a number of actors and actresses as well.

**Debut:** May 24th, 2017 with Dream Girls ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXlBFdAUIAE)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ChuZOwYUTE)).  A song that has a lot of GFriend vibes both musically and in visual aesthetic.  

**Most Recent Comeback:** August 14th, 2019 with We Got the Power ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dJ58rIuaMo)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCMAvTL0Hbg)).  A big conceptual shift for the group, moving to a hard-edged 'tough girl' concept after going very cute in their two previous MVs.

**YouTube Channel:** [Girls' Alert (GsA) Official](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClzGh7dPPDU5eP64af_UHlQ/videos)

**Other MVs and Live Performances:**

* I Wish It Was You ([Live Performance Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq4Slo0jTuA))  This is a B-Side from their Daddy Long Legs album, it appears to be a cover, but I'm not sure who the original is.
* Waku Waku ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8oV5uiDeUU))

* [Rough Solo Dance Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqGwx_sYkI&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Trivia:** Originally the group planned on releasing four single albums to represent the four seasons and then a full album to represent the whole year, with the recent big concept shift I'm not sure if that's still the plan or if 'We Got the Power' is just the summer song.  The new leader Jisung was dubbed 'the 60kg idol' by the Korean media because of her above-average weight.  However, she's embraced the title as she feels her body is healthy (and really, she just has a lot of muscle, she looks great) and has received positive attention for it.  She's been chosen as the model for Korean fashion brand Keyplace Jeans.

**Genre:** Soloist, Vocal Forward

**MVs and Live Stages:**

**Vlogs:** [Some Bobo content via K've Entertainment YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNEOwM5RDJcNYxZ8Qfbo8gg/videos)

**Trivia:** I'm pretty sure this song is in Korean and not Khmer, but I could be wrong.  It appears that K've is a Cambodian company but is trying to push some of its artists into the Kpop-sphere.

* Go Girls! ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uubjp8GjWUE)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arjWWkSKN0k)) - Technically a pre-debut single, the video centers on over-sexed video game avatars, but the song is really catchy
* Too Difficult ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9TWbkN0K8)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzVj2KpnL4U)) - Their debut song, with a creative MV that makes the most of its low budget.  Some Jpop/JRock influences in the music (including a percussion track that sounds way too intense for the song, but is somehow endearing despite the oddness).  I also get some Crayon Pop vibes here.
* Melon Melon Watermelon ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UknbwzhDU9Y)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fGcncdu80c)) A poppy cute song with a video that I think it supposed to be a Karaoke homage
* Sora Sora ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBR8PQ-BUxU)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQo28P9KwMQ)) They shifted back hard towards JRock with this comeback and released an unapologetically hard rock track that's legitimately great.  Unfortunately their stylists made them look like Nazis, which predictably resulted in major backlash and was the beginning of the end for the group.
* Dream Bang ([music link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dns25nlJMd4)) The B-Side to their Sora Sora single album, a really pretty and deceptively harmonically complex ballad, the perfect cool-down after the hard hitting title track, and showing off again that the girls really can sing.
* Crazy Cowboy ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhi78xsKviw)) - Staying with the JRock we have a throwback to their official debut single with them doing battle with giant mascots again.

* [Follow Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0spEnqOgcw) (the Mansudang Gymnastics Song)

**Active Between:** April 30th, 2014 and sometime in 2016.

**Reason for disbandment:** The backlash over the Nazi aesthetics in Sora Sora made them well known for the wrong reasons.  While there was a ton of talent in the group and they had a unique sound, they were never able to turn that tide around.  Their company Pandagram seems to also now be defunct.

**Trivia:** Pritz stands for 'Pretty Rangers in the Terrible Zone' which is a genuinely terrible name, thankfully they just went by Pritz which is much better.  All of their videos feature guys in giant mascot/monster costumes.  

Shoutout to u/eizenne for reminding me about them.

I would like you all to give me 8 songs that I should feature in my K-POP song battle in which I use a tournament bracket to figure out my favorite out of them all. I will pit two against each other and the winning song proceeds to the next round. You can use this as an opportunity to promote your faves, maybe get me to listen to those criminally underrated songs. I'm not looking for your favorite songs of all time, I just want you to give me 8 songs to listen to. I cannot tell when the video will be out but I will be ending this survey on October 5th so hopefully I get enough responses before then, if not I will extend it to October 12th. I am looking for a total of 64 or 128 songs so we have an even tournament bracket. I am estimating that the video will hopefully be out before late November/early December if it takes me that long. I will accept releases in other languages by some groups since they're just too good to not listen to. If you guys could include some underrated or nugu groups that would be nice but I'll be happy with popular groups as well. I'm mainly looking for b-sides but title tracks will do as well. I will value everyone's choices and will try to play every song that gets suggested in my video.

Mine is definitely Gain from Brown Eyed Girls. Her releases have been pretty diverse in terms of dealing w a wide range of themes regarding female sexuality and romantic relationships. She's always sexy but each time it's from a different emotional space. Her tracks run the gamut from bright and joyous ([Bloom](https://youtu.be/K64mb5KUhhs)), dark n thrilling ([Paradise Lost](https://youtu.be/4i32ANEa5mk)), playful n sensual ([Apple (Feat. Jay Park)](https://youtu.be/qSEtAC8wkhw), tragic n morbid(?) ([Carnival (The Last Day)](https://youtu.be/SXHJQ7CYqQM)), deceitful n seductive ([Truth or Dare](https://youtu.be/ZrdNZUUHt60)), and aggressive n raw ([Fxxk U (Feat. Bumkey)](https://youtu.be/VSAVsstaj4E)). I just really admire her commitment and fearlessness when it comes to her music and performances; she's always mesmerizing. 

Who are some of your favs? and what do you enjoy about their music or performances in terms of themes, aesthetics or sound?",64,62
