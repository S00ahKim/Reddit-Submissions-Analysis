What they can do for global fans:

More variety on Youtube and Vlive. I was so happy when Exo Arcade (VLIVE) came out instantly with English subs. 

Red Velvet and Exo's variety shows (Level Up Project and Exo's Ladder) are exclusive to a Korea only site... 

English subtitles (or more languages) on all title tracks for all artists. I mean there are so many fans that have already translated most of SM songs, I don't feel like it would be that much work to sub. (I could be wrong)

Scheduling:

Why were 3 active artists shoved into the most competitive month in a while, it seems it keeps on happening where SM can't spread out releases throughout the year.

 (Ex: EXO, RED VELVET, NCT 127 - NOVEMBER 2018... EXO, RED VELVET - AUGUST 2017)

This September I don't think an SM artist even made a comeback.


Red Velvet's Umpah Umpah was the summer song and SM decided to release it in mid August after people were expecting the June comeback to be but got Zimzalabim'd. (not that bad of a song)


Transparency:

NCT Dream has 4 members graduating (Jeno, Jaemin, Haechan, Renjun) and we still don't have an idea where their going. (NCT 127 or new NCT unit)
Rumors and insults online don't get addressed and SM just stays quiet. (Renjun drama, Renjun had to address fans on Vlive)

Treatment:

You invest so much money into these idols and if you keep them happy, they are more likely to resign and make you more money.
Lost Jessica, Luhan, Tao, Kris, Amber, Luna, 3 TVXQ Members, Super Junior M 
Imagine a world with OT12 EXO, SNSD OT9, FX OT5, Super Junior OT13 + M, TVXQ OT5

Resources:

Invest more money in your older groups to provide even more longtivity and fan outreach. I'd die for a pathcode teaser series for any SM artist.

SM is probably a billion $ company that can afford most of the things that can fix these problems.


Think I covered a lot, I can probably go on for days... I will apreciate SM production and training and the vision LSM had for all of these groups.

Big Hit:

I don't know a lot about the company and its relationship with BTS but it seems (from an outsiders POV) Bang cares about how BTS is treated and puts resources to make them bigger and bigger each year. They also have a lot of creative freedom.

JYP:

???, Management team seems good, Transparent with Mina... don't really follow so I don't know much.

YG:

56,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-10-1,2019,10,1,15,dbph8z,self.kpop,What do you think of the current state of KPOP in North America? And the future of current groups.,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dbph8z/what_do_you_think_of_the_current_state_of_kpop_in/,Jwu9197,1569912819,"I thought I'd open a discussion after the news of SuperM to discuss and voice opinion to the current state of kpop in North America. Ranging from how it's having an impact with culture, genre of music and impact towards the rest of the kpop industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I think:

There's a lot to say right now but I think the first thing to talk about is what is current in the North America scene. As if it's not evident enough, BTS is currently the face of kpop in North America. Whether you're an Army or not, you have to admit it. Ask anyone what they know of kpop and 90% will say BTS. BTS's rise to the top in America is so much more than the growth of their group. Their marketing, opportunity and timing is great. I start with BTS because I want to highlight what Bighit did with their rising group. Taking BTS at a time that they we're prevailing finally in Korea and relative Asian countries, Bighit decides to bring that hype to overseas fans as well. With large numbers of fans, the American music industry is swept by something they'd never really experienced before. Self composition, loving messages and beautiful MVs were essential to the grasp of the group. Choosing things that viewers can admire. 

Now take this to the current state of kpop groups trying to push into more of a global scale. We see newer groups culminating these past couple years trying to make a domestic impact and global impact  simultaneously. A group that I had decided to follow was Loona (""yes ik oh boi the typical stan loona fanatic"" keep reading) Loona is a group that has picked up more in America than it has in Korea and that's just facts. Looking at their debut, ""favorite"" was considered to be their better song and fans (american) were upset because Hihigh didn't fit the ""American vibes"" as much as Favorite did. I believe that Hihigh was chosen specifically to be a cute, bubbly and catchy song that would catch on in Korea such as Twice's ""Cheer Up"" which would end up making Loona a staple and a face in korea for at least a possible year or two minimum. Debuting a new girl group is so difficult now because it feels like they have to choose between girly girl cute concept or a more girl crush, bad ass feel. BlackPink is by far the biggest ambassador of this. They decided to go for a daring bad ass vibe to their whole group, featuring more rap than a typical debut girlgroup would. This caught on for international fans a lot more and with the help of being a YG gg, they succeeded with ease. Now we see that with their combined fandom of both K-blinks and International Blinks, they have built a massive fan base that supports and craves music that is out of the old girly girl group concept. SM being the company of brainless marketers almost made this work with their group Red Velvet as well. We saw the massive impact Peekaboo and Bad boy had internationally.  The concept was different, and displayed a very appealing side to both k-reveluvs and International reveluvs. What we unfortunately see is that because Red Velvet also had successful summer tracks in ""red flavor and Power up"", they have opted away from their lead and went back to the weird stuff. NOW BEFORE ANYONE YELLS AT ME "" I THINK RBB, ZIMZLBM AND UMPAH ARE HUGE BOPS ALRIGHT"". HOWEVER, if they had wanted to continue their international track they had started, these were not the concepts they should had gone for. We see this naivety carry over the the present day now in SuperM. 

SuperM is set to debut OCT.4 but even before they debut, there have been massive conflicts to how they will do and whether this is a good idea. The whole argument of taking members from their respective groups is a different argument but we want to focus on what this means for North America and kpop here. First off, we see them promote them well in terms of a Korean comebacks. I think any SM group stan can say that these are the teasers that we would like to see for our biased group. Seeing SM invest in good merchandise, Video teasers is the dream, however; SM has failed to analyze their targeted audience. There is two ways you can approach their idea. #1 they go for an NCT, styled song and hope that it's good enough and catches on (just like how regular caught on)  OR #2 They actually considered what has worked (""the Bighit/BTS run mentioned earlier"") but didn't want to be similar and went for something completely different and pray.... 

SO WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY?

My conclusion consists of what I think the future of Kpop in American will look like (at least for the next few years)

I can't see any reality other than BTS and BlackPink being the only kpop groups to massively stand in America. Kcon gives opportunity to groups to travel and see international fans, however; when it comes to media coverage and catching on to mainstream platforms such as: award shows and tv shows, they will always stand a step below. The opportunity that BTS has seized, is something that even North American musicians chase after. I feel that Korean music labels will now feel obligated to push their new or existing groups to North America to gain fame but will continuously fall short. Unless a music label bring in real proper american influence to run a comeback or debut for a group, they will miss an impact needed to touch the non-kpop listeners. I would save that the theme of love is probably the best to follow for groups. Not cheesy, love chasing or broken heart love; self love and empowering love. The reason is because 1) Ego and flexing is cool for fans of a group but isn't very inviting for outsiders. Broken heart love is already well pronounced in american culture and doesn't really have a spot for Korean artists. Self love and empowering love has a positive media front and isn't as cringe for the skeptical viewers.  Kpop groups have gone from making groups that kpop listeners will like, to groups that will appeal to those who have never heard of kpop. I believe this to be the most difficult era to be an idol. Your group must consist of unique visuals, a strong debut song, good promotions, unique vocal capabilities and much more. Looping back to Loona, I believe that they have the potential to reach a great position if they are able to appeal to domestic fans. Groups like G-Idle have been able to find their own style and will progress at their own pace. It'zy may have the chance to fly a little bit higher with JYP being smart with their style and combacks. Following twice's fame they have a lot of opportunity in front of them. Red Velvet are in a difficult situation in which they will probably have to work their way back up with some different come backs. Blackpink will most likely be the top girl group in America for a while with their international impact. Exo will need a exceptional comeback to keep them above domestically and internationally while their members take their time to do their military service (Please give kai a solo album with the style of ""confessions"".. I swear it will catch on). Stray Kids are a group I don't know much about but from what I've heard, they are very diverse vocally and are talented dancers. If JYP play his cards right with them and It'zy, they have 2 big powerhouses on the rise. Ateez I feel are similar in their postion as stray kids, in which they need to continue working and will hopefully find a big break out.  Bighit are in perhaps the biggest spot, by continually pushing BTS, they will have a consistent group that will do well for them the next few years without doubt. TXT as well, are set up well with a good concept story. Lastly the god awful SM entertainment have a lot of work to do. Its been said that they will be debuting a new girl group which is risky to say the least. As a Reveluv, it's a pretty scarry thought but that's personal. Depending on whether they do better than NCT or not will really determine the companies position. Fixing Exo's schedules to the best as humanly possible while they are serving would be their best bet financially also bring back Lay for F\*ck sake. In-terms of what to do with NCT... I really don't know. If it was me managing that project, I would probably debut a new NCT group, taking the ""strongest"" members from dream and 127, wayV etc. (using ""strongest"" in a bias manner sorry) but pray that they can produce something more than what they are right now. In all honesty SuperM should have been a NCT project or they should go back and make NCT 2019. If they are able to culminate enough success then, they can re roll out the other groups and make their global sub groups (wayV, dream etc.). Lastly YG entertainment. With all the recent controversies, I think the best thing for YG to do is release the entire music company. Let that freak yg save whatever money he has left. Send every artist over to Pnation or their sub label ""TheBlackLabel"". Sending the more ""YG styled"" artists there will give them the creative freedom that really fit their style. Ikon, blackpink, and even Bigbang could thrive there. With the return of their banks, GD, TOP and Taeyang, the three could go as 3 or take to themselves and pursue a solo career with collaborations. (I just want more GD collabs with IU, Ziont T. and new ones with like Mino, Zico, Dean etc.)

In the end, what I can compare Kpop in America to is the company 88rising. They are a label that have been able to draft Chinese hip-hop and rnb artist and integrate them into America. If kpop wants to do the same, I would turn to something like that. An American label willing to accept these artist and let them do what they want while still directing in a direction that will catch on.

The final question is : how do Kpop groups become acceptable in America while staying true to Korean pop music. Where is the golden ratio? Perhaps it's truly just a hidden secret.... A secret SM is willing to throw away legends for lmao.

Lastly I feel like a should point out that this text is written by a North American Exo-l and Reveluv.

And although my English is understandable, I don't have that confidence that most YouTubers have when speaking. Plus, sometimes my accent makes it hard to pronounce certain words. I also speak slower than I had thought - confirmed that after listening to the full audio of my first video. 

I know that some of these are improvements that can be achieved with time but I'm still insecure about following through with using my voice. Do you guys have any tips? Or, do you think that people won't mind my accent?

I don't want to use that robotic voice that most fan accounts do. They are so impersonal and sometimes annoying because they basically butcher the names of idols... Also, I'm not sure if most people like channels with legends only (you know, those ones that have a background song and the information showing up on the video).

So I should expect loads of artists to start dropping English language songs and albums. 

This is what happens when you let American/Western companies have a say in who you are and how you present yourselves to the rest of the world.

The rest of the world that doesn't speak English happily accepts western music (to my knowledge) without telling that said artist to sing in their native language when promoting or releasing music. Why the west does it baffles me. They, especially here in America, talk a lot about diversity but it comes with the caveat: it must be in English.

I want to thank everyone that helped with suggestions, it gave me a really good base to start.

I want to preface this again with the fact that I dont follow boy groups that closely and all of this was pure research. Sometimes that research was difficult and information was spotty at best, so there may very well be errors so please let me know if you see something that needs to be fixed.

I only counted active groups that have had at least 3 comebacks and released songs within the last 2 years.  I know some of the groups on here are a bit up in the air, but for the sake of a comprehensive list, if they released music in the last 2 years, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Also, I wanted to outline a few rules I adhered to when making judgement calls on what constitutes a release:

*  Solo work is not counted but subgroup work is

* This only counts Korean releases, not Japanese, Chinese, or English releases

*  If 2 songs are promoted but appear on the same album, its 1 release.  The exception to this is compilation albums where multiple singles are released prior to the album and then compiled all into one album later.  Each single will count, as well as the album IF there is also a new single on it.

*  If an album is repackaged but has a new song on it, it is counted as a separate release.  SM LOVES to do this apparently. 

*  Alternative releases that are not promoted (IE Olympic theme songs, OSTs, ec) do not count

There was some discussion about how enlistment will affect some groups and not others.  At the start, I tried desperately to factor this time loss in, but it proved far too situational and subjective.  For example, Super Junior would have been a nightmare since at least one member was enlisted at a time for the better part of a decade, but the group and subgroups still released music.  In the end I decided that I didnt need to do all of that and that it would affect the results in more of a subjective manner than I felt comfortable with.  This list is not a competition, just data, its yours to do with what you like.  I did, however, try and find as much info I could on if and how many members had enlisted at some point in the groups' careers and indicated if the group had completed, partially completed, or hadnt started enlistment.  That way you can make your own judgement calls on who is most affected by enlistment. 

___________________________________________________

First I will start with my original method of counting all days since debut.  Please note that this has been refined now to NOT include debuts but start counting at the first comeback:

249,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-10-2,2019,10,2,17,dc7ei2,self.kpop,Favourite MV with an origin story or hidden meaning?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dc7ei2/favourite_mv_with_an_origin_story_or_hidden/,strawberryvar,1570005186,"Mine personally would have to be Red Velvet's One of these Nights, which is speculated to be based off the Sewol Ferry Tragedy. 

For those that don't know, the Sewol Ferry Tragedy occured in 2014. Hundreds of passengers (the majority of which being students from the Danwon high school) lost their lives when the boat tipped and flooded as a result of negligence and a lack of care from those who owned the vessle, the staff on board and the Korean government organization who were meant to make sure it was safe and following all of the guidelines. Only 172 people survived. 

In the MV, we see Yeri (who was of school age at the time of the tragedy) laying in a lone boat that is floating somewhere. Throughout the MV, it begins to rain on her and the boat begins to fill with water, and it almost completely submerges her towards the end of the MV. This is a reference to Yeri being a junior herself, and how many junior students from Danwon High School drowned during the incident. They were alone, and left to die as a result of the staff abandoning the ship as it flooded.

There is also another scene where we see Seulgi walking through a hallway with glass panels acting as the wall. Through the glass, all we can see is water. As Seulgi walks down the corridor, the lights above her begin to flicker and fade, referencing how as the boat flooded, the power slowly turned off, leaving the remaining passengers who were unable to escape to drown and die in darkness, as they couldn't get out. At the end, we see Seulgi walking down the corridor with the lights completely turning off as she walks. 

At the end of the MV as well, we also see Irene facing a window that is cracking, and eventually explodes under the pressure of the water. The water bursts out the window and Irene jumps away, falling over and unable to escape it spilling everywhere. 



There is also a scene where we see Joy climbing up a ladder with the water rising below her feet. She looks uncertain and scared as she climbs, possibly referencing how scared the rescued passengers must've been as they didn't know if the ones they cared about were stuck on the ship.",18,40,False,self,,,,,

But when I solved the quiz, I got 4 out of 6 questions wrong.
I usually listen to so many K-pop songs that I thought I'd know some of the fandoms, but this was a wrong idea.
Especially, I've never heard of 2NE1's fandom name.
I'm a little bit embarrassed that I got this quiz less right than people in other countries.

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

I personally dont really care. I dont think kpop MVs need a lead girl or boy or background dancers. I feel the MVs should solely focus on the groups alone, I feel adding anything else takes the focus away from the thing we came to see, our boy/girl groups. Im not completely against groups having girls in their MVs every once in a while, I think it can be nice but its not necessary. The race of those girls arent important either. In the west, we arent lacking in white or black representation. So its nice to watch kpop MVs, to see people you rarely see in the west. Kpop doesnt need diversity.

They all use backing or guide tracks while doing it.

Look - I understand the concept. Pretty much everyone nowadays does it, including most western artists. But these days - especially in K-pop - the backing/guide track almost totally drowns out the live vocals. Remember back in the day when the OGs *didn't* do this (or the backing vocals were at a minimum, like in the chorus)? Let's just take girl groups, for example. Take a gander at Mamamoo's debut stage:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGgrRoMJ6Yc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGgrRoMJ6Yc)

And the above is actually a relatively recent example. Waaaay back when, groups like SES, Fin.kl, and all the rest of the pioneering groups...when they were doing live performances, they did so with almost no backing/guide vocal help. Sure, they lip-synced a majority of the time back in the day, but when certain shows (e.g., Gayo Top 10) forced live performances you could hear raw vocals and not the type of stuff where you have to MR-remove it to hear anything not edited. I honestly wouldn't care if they strayed off key a bunch of times; it's hard to sound really good with so much dancing involved in this era of K-pop. At this point, I'd have so much respect for any performer who'd do it *without* heavy guide/backing vocals.

Also, minor site note - why do people have guide/backing vocals on rap portions? I really don't understand this. I can see why you'd want a guide if you're singing to help you stay on key while dancing around. With rap, you just need to stay on the beat. Come on now. If you've been training for these performances stages for months (even years for some) and you're a rapper, you should be able to rap live without a guide helping you.

I personally dont really care. I know korean society is very non accepting of people of other races besides white people. So I dont expect groups to have diverse MVs. Plus its just unnecessary. I dont think kpop MVs need a lead girl or boy or background dancers. I feel the MVs should solely focus on the groups alone, I feel adding anything else takes the focus away from the thing we came to see, our boy/girl groups. Im not completely against groups having girls in their MVs every once in a while, I think it can be nice but its not necessary.  Kpop doesnt need diversity.

I'm talking about korean releases only. Of course it's just a prediction. At this point, Pledis has a chance to be 3rd best-selling company in 2019, outselling JYP and YG. Even if JYP will have higher sales than them, it will be still impressive that Pledis managed to sell more than 2M with two active groups only. If not EXO and EXO members solo debuts this year (Baekhyun and Chen), Pledis would have higher sales than SM too, no matter how many comebacks would they give their other groups.

Or that kpop becomes a little stale after a while and my interest does dwindle. 

But when a certain comeback is announced, I get back in the saddle again.

Groups like Red Velvet and EXO always seem to release interesting and incredible comebacks (like Tempo for example, that song is incredible).

BTS also has great songs, but I prefer their main Korean comebacks. Oh My Girl (I think) releases music at a reasonable pace and keeps it fresh to me. And Lovelyz (though I'm not a huge fan), I've always seem to enjoy their main comebacks.

How about you?",27,32,False,self,,,,,

I argue they will do fairly well album sales-wise maybe the first week or two, after that, I don't know.

I mean, they are selling 7 versions of their album, bundling he album with everything imaginable, they are dropping concert tickets during their first week of sales, so that album bundles from that can count, they have three fandoms and solo stans who will spend money on them and support their favs no matter what.

This is no shade, 99% of artists are selling their albums this way (By bundling) in the US.

So I wouldn't be surprised if the debut within the top 10 of the Billboard 200.

Outside of that, I don't how much of a connection they will make with the general public.

I wanted to make a discussion post to know r/kpop's stance on this matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think cultural appropriation in k-pop is understandable because of their ignorance, due to the largely homogeneous society they live in? Or do you think it is unforgivable either way, that they \*should\* know about another's culture because they're borrowing from it? If its the former, where do you draw the line?

&amp;#x200B;

What is the worst case of CA that you've seen?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've read responses of Asian people regarding J-hope and his dreads, where they explained that imitation is a form of appreciation in Korea. Today I saw a video of a guy explaining CA to Koreans - he previously had the opinion that cultural appropriation is being screamed too often by ""woke"" people, but then came to realize he wasn't able to empathize because he never put himself in their shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

A comment regarding Han Hye Jin's blackface controversy saying to think of the issue at hand as how Koreans think of the imperial flag made him realize this (Disney's DUMBO had to change their poster in Korea because of its resemblance to the imperial flag).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm Indian, so here are some examples from an Indian perspective:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jennie ""disrespecting"" Bharatanatyam

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2) Wearing bindi/Saree/Indian clothing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3)Oh My Girl's Curry dance

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4)Lee Hyori dancing to \*cough\* the Gayatri Mantra

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1 - I've trained in Bharatanatyam, while we have to be correct in our Mudras and postures, I've seen many Indians butcher it worse than Jennie did in that 4 second clip. I thought it was cute.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Eh, I don't mind. I'm sure 99% of Indians don't mind either as long as you dress properly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3 ""Shanti Shanti, Fire Yoga"" ""Namaste"" ""I like Curry"" This left a \\\*ahem\\\* bad taste in my mouth. This is mild to moderately offensive. I can get why they don't think it's offensive, but...it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4 I can't imagine it getting worse than this. The Gayatri Mantra is a very very old and sacred hymn. Probably every Hindu born kid knows this mantra, even some Indians of other religions do to. Dancing sensually to a song called ""White Snake"" incorporating the Gayatri Mantra in it.. this is offensive in so many levels.

&amp;#x200B;

First snake = India, I can get past this because snake charmers are an Indian novelty (not that it's forgivable); but choosing a random Indian hymn just to make it sound exotic, without even attempting to know what it is?

&amp;#x200B;

This can't even be excused by ignorance, this is ignorance by \*choice\*, Lee Hyori doesn't care because she's not selling her album to Indians. That's the case for most CA, but now that k-pop is becoming global, it's basic marketing/management to \*learn about the market\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Cultural appropriation is being brushed off by some k-pop fans as ignorance, while this may be correct, I really think that people other than those from affected minorities should not have a say because we'll never be able to understand their feelings. Some of them may not be offended, some might, all of their opinions are valid. Even if Koreans think of imitation as appreciation, it isn't their intention that matters, it's the feelings of those whose culture they're borrowing from that matters.",3,0,False,self,,,,,

\[**Background\]**

CJ ENM's audition manipulation seems to go way back to the Superstar K era as can be seen in this interview by Bradley Ray Moore of Busker Busker (`Source 1`), who happens to be a contestant in an M-Net's Superstar K season. Over time, CJ ENM apparently became bolder and sloppier, culminating in Produce X 101 fiasco. Incidentally, the manipulation method used in Produce x 101 wasn't new. It was already used in Produce 48, the previous season of Produce Series. (`Source 2`)

Without having any trouble over Produce 48, it is no particular surprise that the same method has been applied to Produce X 101. Except in Korea, there is an old proverb, ""If a woman were wronged deeply, her vengeance would freeze the ground in the summer."" Perhaps CJ ENM should have heeded to this old adage more closely since the ground did freeze in the case of Produce X 101 where many of the show's fans felt wronged.

**\[CJ ENM's legal strategy: Cut tail and run\]**

From the get-go, CJ ENM's legal strategy was fairly clear. With the increasing public and media attention on the Produce X 101 Vote Rigging issue, as well as some of Produce X 101 fans forming a ""Produce X 101 Fact-Finding Committee"" to pursue legal actions, M-net decided on July 26 to file a criminal complaint to police. The complaint, reading from M-Net's official statement (`Source 3`) and other news reports (`Source 4`), points to M-Net claiming to be unaware of what is going on with the show and asking the police to investigate its own employees.

This preemptive criminal complaint narrows the scope and the direction of the police investigation, by charging that rogue employees have harmed the company through illegal activities, making M-net a victim, not a co-conspirator. It also inadvertently reveals something else about CJ's legal strategy; this is usually not the type of defense strategy employed by a corporate defendant unaware of any wrongdoing.

**\[The direction of Police Investigation: M-Net a victim or a co-conspirator?\]**

Throughout the investigation, the police gave conflicting indications on the direction of its investigation. Police made two search-and-seizure operations: one on the offices of M-net and the data management company on July 31, and the other on the offices of M-net for the second time along with other undisclosed locations on August 12.

It was later reported in Korean news media that the police raid on Aug. 12 targeted a much broader set of data which now known to include all previous seasons of Produce series as well as some of Show Me the Money and Superstar K data. (`Source 5`)

From the scope of the second raid, it can be surmised that the police have had a compelling cause to expand its investigation to include all seasons of Produce series as well as Show Me the Money, and Superstar K, involving a multitude of M-net production teams, adding weight to the possibility of system-wide corruption where CJ ENM is a likely co-conspirator.

However, on Aug 19, the police made a press leak that it was planning on formally charging Produce X 101 production team with the obstruction of business, meaning corporate sabotage, on the basis of changing placements of contestants through vote manipulation. (`Source 6`) This indicated that the police investigation was moving, more or less, along the line of the initial M-Net complaint.

On Sep 2, the police held a press briefing that it was expanding its investigation into all 4 seasons of Produce series. This had a potential of contradicting the earlier Aug 19 press leak since the earlier seasons were produced by a different production team from the Produce X 101 team. However, the police also stated that it had no plan to investigate Idol School, Show Me the Money, or Superstar K, an indication that the investigation would be limited to Produce Series only. (`Source 7`)

On September 17, the head of Seoul Metro Police held a press briefing to state that the police was analyzing through the original voting data, and promised that the investigation would conclude as early as possible.

What is interesting was the scope of investigation outlined by him. He said, ""it is taking time since the investigation also includes the previous season run by the same producer."" (`Source 8*`) This seemed to imply that the police were focused on two seasons, Produce 48 and Produce X 101, produced by Ahn Jun-young, echoing the initial M-Net complaint.

**\[At the eye of an emerging storm\]**

The police press briefings until the middle of September may be seen as police following along the legal strategy of CJ ENM. However, it is highly uncertain if such a direction can be maintained by police because the winds are not blowing in CJ's favor. In fact, several currents are merging around this case to form a potential firestorm. They are:

1. **Police vs. Prosecutors**: Korea is currently undergoing a judiciary reform. At the heart of it is the issue of rebalancing the roles and the authorities between police and the prosecutors' office. The law to rebalance police and the prosecutors' office is fast-tracked for a vote in Korean parliament this fall. The law is vehemently opposed by the prosecutors' office and passionately supported by police. (`Source 9`) With the law hanging in the balance, the tension between each side is understandably high, with each side looking to discredit the other through high profile cases to bolster their arguments with the public. Produce X 101 case is a high profile case, involving a major Chaebol accused of cheating many youngsters out of their hopes and dreams. Police have no choice but to tread carefully.
2. **Increased scrutiny of news media**: With CJ ENM being a white elephant in the Korean media market, the initial media response was less than audible given the large public outcry and the explosive nature of the case. Especially absent was any in-depth investigative reporting or root cause analysis. However, the tide is turning.  On Aug 20, PD Note, Korea's leading investigative TV news program similar to 60 Minutes in the US, has begun investigating and finding witnesses on the case. PD Note released, on Oct 1, a teaser titled ""**We will show you the truth of fake audition**"" set to air on Oct 15. (`Source 10`) Also, op-ed pieces critical of CJ's business practices that damage Korea's entertainment ecosystem begin to appear in new media. (`Source 11`) Now that the blood is in the water, it is likely to get uglier.
3. **National attention and Politicians getting in on the act**: Given the national attention on the issue, politicians from both sides of the aisle are getting in on the act. Ha Tae Kyung, a Korean national assemblyman, has announced the ""**Produce X Public Surveillance Act**"" to prevent vote-rigging and other unfair practices on shows similar to Produce X 101 to be submitted within the current term. (`Source 12`) During the government agency audit by the Nationa Assembly on Oct 1, a long debate has broken out whether to subpoena CEO of CJ ENM as a material witness at the National Assembly.  On Oct 4, the chairman of Korea Communications Committee, Korea's media regulatory body, has promised an industry-wide investigation to scrutinize any show with a public voting element, under heavy pressure from assemblymen. (`Source 13`)
4. **Mobilization of fan groups of previous M-Net shows**: Despite of Sep 2 police announcement that police had no plan to investigate Idol School, Police's hands were forced when a group of Idol School fans filed a criminal complaint charging CJ ENM with fraud and attempt to destroy evidence to the police on Sep 6. Based on the filing, the police opened a separate investigation into the case expanding the investigation beyond Produce Series. (`Source 14`) Given the situation, the possibility of other M-Net show fans taking legal action couldn't be completely discounted.

**\[Police Investigation: the latest development\]**

On Sep 30, the police news briefing revealed that, in addition to reiterating its investigation of all 4 seasons of Produce Series,  it was investigating Idol School for a possible vote-rigging. It was also revealed that a search and seizure operation to secure the original voting data of Idol School was conducted on Sep 21. Although the police were mum on the issue, many new reports commented on the fact that two shows had completely different producers respectively implying that the problem went beyond the case of a rogue production team. (`Source 15`)

On Oct 1, CBS No Cut News reported that the Seoul Metro Police Cyber Crime team revealed that 2-3 members of X1 should not have made the cut based on the actual voting result. Based on this finding, police formally booked the executive PD of the show and raided a few agencies with some of the X1 members under management.  The purpose of the agency raids was to establish the transactional connections between the agencies and the Produce X 101 production team. (`Source 16`)

On Oct 2, MaeKyung reported that the raided agencies were MBK, Woolim, and Starship. It also reported that police raided a few agencies with some of Produce 48 winners under management on the same day as Police confirmed the production team's involvement in the live voting results of Produce 48. (`Source 17`)

**\[Final Thought\]**

No Cut News report on Oct 1 and Maekyung report on Oct 2 is quite interesting and unusual for the following reason; There is a law that forbids an investigating agency to release any information on a crime prior to the case formally scheduled for a trial. This law is rarely ever enforced in the past. However, with the tension high between police and the prosecutors' office, they have been at each other's throat with this law in recent days. (`Source 18`)

Given this environment, two reports basically amount to releasing detailed information on crime by police. Especially, identifying the names of 3 raided agencies equates to indirectly naming the members not making the cut. So the real question is why would police risk releasing such information that could potentially place them in a hot seat with the prosecutors' office? I suppose the answer will be revealed in due course. Until then, stay tuned.

I'm a long-time lurker of the K-pop reddit and I really hope it's ok to post this - I've seen requests like this before so fingers crossed!

I'm doing a project for my masters about K-pop fans and how they connect, and I was hoping to get some feedback from you guys as part of my research. If you have a spare moment, could anyone please tell me:

1. How/where did you meet your fandom friends? Did you find them through social media? Or at a concert, perhaps?

2. If online - have you met any of your fandom friends IRL, or are they online-based relationships?

3. What newsources do you use to get the latest on your favs? Official social channels? Fan accounts? K-pop news sites? This subreddit? Or somewhere else completely?

My own answers to get the ball rolling - I'm a Shawol and was quite active on Twitter and Tumblr up until a couple of years ago. I've since moved onto Discord. I'm super shy though and find it hard to be vocal in online communities, especially when everyone seems to be friends already! But I have made a few friends through these channels, and others from school IRL. I haven't met any of my online friends IRL yet because we all live in different countries :(

I use this subreddit a lot for news! I also have a few Tumblrs that I follow which are pretty good at regular updates. I've found Instagram to be helpful too. And in my experience, fan accounts are often more helpful than the official ones! Haha.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Are they not popular outside of Korea? Do people not like their style of music? Are their fans not the type who stream? I'm not complaining or anything. I'm just a curious new kpop fan and I can't help but look at their views and compare it to other above mid tier/just a little below the high tier girl groups like WJSN, Oh my Girl, AOA or even CLC. Lovelyz' youtube views are quite low and fans of other groups I see online stream their groups' mv and stages like crazy because apparently ""views matter"", but does it really?

Unfortunately, I didn't keep a back up copy (because I'm stupid), so I can't get the numbers back for those albums.  (I was able to get a reliable source for X1, Up10tion, Twice, and The Boyz's August numbers).  However, if there was a release in August for an artist near the end of the list, then I've lost those numbers.  I'm going to change my process a little bit so that we don't need to worry about this again and I've marked the lines that could be affected.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

For those of you who ask every month, no this is not going to make me stop including the other albums that released this year.  There are many people who like to see how albums are doing through the year.  The chart will be reset in January after the 2019 numbers have been fully recorded and concluded.

Standard Items: **Please note the last column tells you what date the numbers go through.  Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.**  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release from the month listed in the title* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

**\[Translation of the news broadcast transcript\]** 

Police have expanded its investigation into the collusive relationship between the broadcaster and the management agencies. 

Since a similar accusation was made on another previous audition program, some are now calling it ""employment scam.""

Kim Woo-Joon reporting

At the heart of Produce Series, often called the gateway to Idolhood, is the voting paid for by the participating public.

But in the 4th season, 'Produce X,' an allegation of vote manipulation, on the live voting paid for by the participating public, was raised.

Viewers, feeling betrayed and angry, filed a criminal charge to police.

\[Lead Plaintiff for Produce X 101 Fact-Finding Committee: They have been repeatedly lying by claiming there was nothing wrong and just rare coincidence. I believe this is a criminal fraud against public viewers.\]

After nearly 3 months of investigation, police came to the conclusion that the live voting result of the final episode was manipulated.

Police, who already raided CJ ENM, raided 5 additional management agencies on Oct 1.

Police have said that all seasons of Produce Series are under investigation and that all the evidence seized from the production team and management agencies are now being analyzed.

Amidst all this, fans raised accusations of vote manipulation on yet another audition program, 'Idol School' from 2 years ago.

parents of a trainee, who participated in both Produce and Idol School, compared 'vote-rigging' to 'employment scam.'

\[Lead Plaintiff for Idol School Fact-Finding Committee: We agree that this is an employment scam and also a criminal fraud against public viewers. This is the reason we filed a criminal complaint.\]

The broadcaster has said it feels sorry for causing controversies but declined to comment further until the official announcement of police.

Police are investigating not only the vote-rigging but also the collusion between the broadcaster and management agencies expanding the scope of the investigation.

What started out as a mere suspicion has escalated into 'employment scam' and now all eyes are on police to see what result they will reveal.",1,6,False,self,,,,,

As the late summer heat begins to fade let's get to know the crisp refreshing sound of Lime Soda!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Lime Soda**

**Who are they?:** A three (formerly two) member girl group under D Maker Entertainment.

**Company:** Lime Soda appears to be the only group currently under D Maker.  They have an 'actors' tab on their website, but no one under it, so perhaps they're looking to expand into drama style entertainment as well.

**Members:**

**Debut:** July 12th, 2017 with ZZZ ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq5vqNeuI30)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZtXWYRIcAI)).  A fun colorful song about the benefits of getting enough sleep (something I can definitely vibe with) with a guest rap feature by MC Gree.

**Most Recent Comeback:** October 4th, 2019 with Wave ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0cUDqwAWLM)) (no live stage yet).  A chic modern song that shows a more mature sound from the group.  

**YouTube Channel:** [Lime Soda Official](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC03EK-BxkDP6MOtJHtsYl7Q/videos)

**Other MVs and Live Performances:**

* All Eyez On Me ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu5r6Mn0Ubo)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgas-PIQtp0)).  A fun summery track with a bit of trop-house vibe that still feels fresh

**Trivia:** The group considered other names before debut, including 'Cotton Candy' and 'Shooting Star'.  There was briefly the potential for a 4th member this year, who went by the stage name Teeny, but she left the group before the Wave comeback.  Hyerim and Seungji are both members of a girl/gamer crossover promotional group called Aqua which also features members of girl group Oahsis and former Produce series alumni trainees under The Music Works.

**Trivia:** The leader of the band was previously in another band called Dongnae which broke up after members had to start enlisting.  Afterwards he wanted to start a new band and was inspired by The Beatles and The Beach Boys where all members sang and harmonized and wanted the new group to do that as well.  The characters used in HOA's Korean name () mean 'Good Country'.

**K-Tigers Zero**

**Who Are They:** A 12-member co-ed group under K-Tigers Entertainment.  K-Tigers are a combo Taekwondo Exhibition Team and Idol Group 

**Genre:** Idol-Martial Arts Hybrid

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Now ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8uRGqiTe8s)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaq1NVejKlg))  They don't need a charger, big boy.  This R&amp;B inspired slow-jam has plenty of energy on its own
* Odd and Beautiful ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCl-qhSSac8))  Because even martial arts aficionados love ballads (it is really pretty)
* Side Kick ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM_Ta4CSt7k)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDKXYvbXdZA)) Sort of abrasive electro-pop but with a lot of cool moves in the choreo

**KProfiles:** [Info Link](https://kprofiles.com/k-tigers-zero-profile-facts/)

**Vlogs:** [K-Tigers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Ktigerstkd/videos)

**Trivia:** The K-Tigers Taekwondo school was founded in 1990 and their demonstrations teams are some of the most well-known in the sport.  While the demonstration teams have performed routines to Kpop music in the past, this group marks the school's first foray into an actual idol group and original music.

**FlyWithMe**

**Who Are They:** A four (Kprofiles says 8 but I only count four in any of their videos) member dance-team expanding into original music

**Genre:** Sexy/Dance-Team

**MVs and Live Stages:**

**KProfiles:** [Info Link](https://kprofiles.com/fly-members-profile/)

**Instagram:** [FlyWithMe Official](https://www.instagram.com/flywithme_official/)

**Trivia:** I tried to link one of their tamer live performances, but if they catch your eye feel free to search them out as they have a ton of fancams out there, and a penchant for giving random audience members lapdances on stage.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Special Feature - In Memorium:**

**CocoSori**

**Who were they?:** A female duet under Mole Entertainment

**Genre:** Experimental Trot-Pop/Jpop-inspired

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Dark Circle ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4SGYjRPx1g)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnOUuMNggBs)) What you get when you combine Orange Caramel with Trot.  Eat your broccoli kids (or make out with it, I'm not one to judge).  I unabashedly love this song.
* Exquisite ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHttanRj6VU)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A8WcNp5kn8)) A manic acid-trip of a song with inexplicable heavy metal breaks and an MV that's almost as weird as the song.  Again, I love everything about this.
* Mi Amor ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnPZ8k3wXqs)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0Seed2A5nY)) This one went pretty mainstream, and I believe it was their most commercially successful release, though I personally think it lacks the charm of their previous songs.

* Sori Solo I Am Not Alone ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX1pD-0lMeI)) feat. Folded Dragons (Post official disbandment of CocoSori)

**Active Between:** January 5th, 2016 - February 1st, 2019

**Reason for disbandment:** Irreconcilable differences between Coco, her company, and Sori.  There was a lot of she-said/they-said and shots fired on both sides, but it appeared that Coco felt the company was prioritizing Sori over her and not holding up to their agreement of promoting her solo work, the company responded that Coco wasn't living up to pledges she'd made and was being rude to them and to Sori, and it all just turned into a huge drama-filled mess including threats of lawsuits.  It's really a shame because the two had amazing on-screen chemistry, though it appears now that behind-the-scenes the picture wasn't so rosy.    

**Trivia:** I linked a few of their Cosplay covers above, but if you like them you should check out their linked YouTube channel as they have a ton of them and they're all really good.  Coco is now a Twitch Streamer.  Sori has released several solo tracks, with her latest being I Am Not Alone, but made comments during promotions that it may be her last musical release.  Sori has appeared on the TV show Fact in Star as a musical analyst and in a Japanese travel show.

All the B-sides slap, they're really good and different so the album is definitely not boring. I particularly loved Super Car, and enjoyed TY's rapping soooo much, much more than in 'Jopping' and 'No Manners'. Because in Super Car, most of his lines are in Korean and he controls his deep hotass voice much better when rapping in his native language. I understand they're pushing the song in western market and that's why they're trying to have as much English lines in songs as possible, but in the title track, TY's parts were underwhelming and it makes me so sad, because I love the man and know that his abilities are no less than any other member's. I wish they'd let him shine more and do what's best for the artist, not what they think will bring more money. It just seems and sounds forced.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm a long-time lurker of the K-pop reddit and I really hope it's ok to post this - I've seen requests like this before so fingers crossed!

I'm doing a project for my masters about K-pop fans and how they connect, and I was hoping to get some feedback from you guys as part of my research. If you have a spare moment, could anyone please tell me:

1. How/where did you meet your fandom friends? Did you find them through social media? Or at a concert, perhaps?
2. If online - have you met any of your fandom friends IRL, or are they online-based relationships?
3. What newsources do you use to get the latest on your favs? Official social channels? Fan accounts? K-pop news sites? This subreddit? Or somewhere else completely?

My own answers to get the ball rolling - I'm a Shawol and was quite active on Twitter and Tumblr up until a couple of years ago. I've since moved onto Discord. I'm super shy though and find it hard to be vocal in online communities, especially when everyone seems to be friends already! But I have made a few friends through these channels, and others from school IRL. I haven't met any of my online friends IRL yet because we all live in different countries :(

I use this subreddit a lot for news! I also have a few Tumblrs that I follow which are pretty good at regular updates. I've found Instagram to be helpful too. And in my experience, fan accounts are often more helpful than the official ones! Haha.",29,7,False,self,,,,,

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back on thursday night for update! I will be off next week due to relocation.

Kara and 9muses are my personal favorite girl groups from that era of kpop, mostly due to their discographies as they barely have a bad song. Im also very impressed with how they always seemed to bounce back from losing members and come back with another great song even after difficult times, its why I have so much respect for both Kara and 9muses.",73,35,False,self,,,,,

Hello! When we first closed the census this year, some people immediately asked us how long it would take, and we said Soon. Turns out it was the YG Soon, and now it has been over a month. Well, we are finally here to bring you news! We redid the census analysis in Typescript and React using the chart.js library, which shows you the data in more or less the same format, but it looks nicer! This code can be mostly reused for next years census, so the analysis wont take as long!  

**You can view the new results in this graph here:** [**http://census-results.redditkpop.com/**](http://census-results.redditkpop.com/)

If you want to view /u/Conceptizuals spaghetti code, you can do so here [https://github.com/rkpop/census/tree/master/src](https://github.com/rkpop/census/tree/master/src). Weve taken care of the data so it has been anonymized and the only recoverable artifacts are whats passed directly to the display.  This was a part of why this took so long, another part being that there were a few projects that Conceptizual didnt get to yet. This includes some of the more interactive graphs that will allow you to answer burning questions such as Who are the most popular groups by region? or Is Mamamoo REALLY the most popular group among lesbians? Those will be ongoing projects and well let you all know of major updates.

Without further ado, heres a breakdown of the census results:

**Breakdown And Comparison**

* **Responses** \- We had a total of 7934 responses this year! Thats 3648 more than last year and beats our previous record of 6465 by 1469! We noticed an increase in the velocity of responses in those last few days before it closed. Its great seeing this increase, even with the account age gate in place! Thank you all so much for participating this year! 
* **Age** \- The 13-17 age group declined from 11.4% to 8.7%, the 18-24 age group declined from 61.4% to 56.7% . The 25-34 age group increased from 24.7% to 30.9%. It seems like were getting older yall. 
* **Gender** \- We split gender identity up a bit this year, because we wanted to capture a more nuanced spectrum of identities. We still saw more men than women, but we also had a notable amount of enbies, genderfluid people, agender people, and some people still figuring it out!
* **Sexuality** \- Previously, people who selected Straight comprised 68.3% of responses, which has seen a decreasing trend over the years! This has continued! This year 62.5% of users selected Straight. 
* **Relationship Status** \- We added in new options this year, Civil Union/Civil Partnership, Divorced, Widowed, Other. About 2.2% voted for these new options across the board. However, yall still mostly single! Weve gone from almost 80% single last year to 76% this year. Users in a relationship increased from 14.9% to 16.9%. Married users increased from 3.7% to 4.7%. 
* **Education** \- This is a new question added in this year. 8.7% are currently in high school. 7.5% are a high school graduate with a diploma. 25.3% are currently working on their Undergrad degree, 23.3% already have their undergrad degree.11.7% are currently enrolled in some college. 4.1% are currently working on their masters degree and 5.1% currently have a masters degree.
* **Employment Status -** Weve added some more options here. Parent/Homemaker/etc, Student (Other), Disabled, Other. The percentages are almost identical to last years results. 39.1% are Employed, 19.6% are employed students, 31% are unemployed students. 7.5% are unemployed, and around 2.6% votes are spread across the last options. 
* **Field of Employment / Study -**  This is a new question for this year. About 17.8% of our users works with computers and math, 9.4% work in business and finances, 9.3% work in arts, design and entertainment, 7.1% in the health sector. 6.6% works with architecture and engineering and 4.6% works with education. Almost 6% voted for Other, so please let us know what you would like to see added for next years census! 

# Where do you currently live?

* **World Region -** Weve changed this a little since last year, now you had the option to choose which world region you lived in, and then after that choose which country you currently reside in. When we looked at the previous census it looked a little too stacked with every single country in one graph, dividing it into continents makes it easier to view both for us and you. 
* **Time Zones** \- This was sorted by timezones in the graph, though viewing it in some ways might drop some of the labels. The list is sorted by the most occupied timezones. 
* **Race or Ethnicity** \- Race and Ethnicity are incredibly complicated! We wanted to make a better visualization for this, but this was one of the things on the to-do list (hopefully sometime before winter ends, but definitely by next year!). In the meantime, every box that was selected counted as one point in a given column. The other way we wanted to do things requires some care, since particular unique answers (and there were many, many combinations of races, many of which were unique) might identify a particular r/kpop redditor. So, to make sure were being safe with your ethnicity and race data, were going to take extra time for our pretty visualizations for this, and give you a nice bar graph for now. 

# K-pop Engagement Questions

* **How were you first exposed to K-pop? -** Interestingly, the bigger categories from last year dropped a little in percentages.We added in new options here; Grew up with it, Video Games Other and Prefer not to answer. Theres 4.1% of our users whos grown up with K-pop, about 2% who found K-pop through video games, and 2.5% who didnt find their option, and voted other. Please let us know what to include here! Exposure to K-pop from a friend, coworker or classmate dropped about 3%, family member dropped 2% and youtube videos dropped almost 2%. 
* **How do you listen to K-pop? -** Paid streaming jumped from 55% last year to up to 62.2% this year. Piracy declined from 26.2% to 18.3%. Otherwise more people stick to just watching their favorite artists for free instead of paying through digital services or albums.
* **When did you start listening to K-pop?** \- Previously our new users who only have been listening to K-pop for less than a year was at 12.1%. This year we are down to 7.8%. Otherwise the graph shows a natural progression from last year. 
* **Do you know Korean? -** Nah, we still dont. Just the same as last year. About 75% said they only know a few phrases. About 5% can speak conversational Korean. 
* **Are you learning, or want to learn Korean? -** 41.6% users who wants to learn but havent started yet. Around 12.3% are currently actively studying or engaged in practice of Korean.   
* **Where do you usually get your K-pop news? -** About 95% of our users rely on r/kpop for news, theres been an increase in going to group subreddits for group news (41.3% -&gt; 44.9%) since last years census. Otherwise its really similar to last years results. 
* **How often do you visit** r/kpop**? -** This has not changed too much since last years census. There are more users  that frequent the subreddit every day. (27.2% -&gt; 31.2%), otherwise its pretty much the same, just one digit differences.) 
* **What is your PRIMARY way to view** r/kpop**?** \- Last year over half of our participants browsed the subreddit on mobile, while 15.2% were using the new reddit design and 32.7% used the old design.This year, almost 60% used mobile to browse this subreddit. 16.2% have opted in for using the new Reddit redesign and 24.4% are still using the old Reddit design.
* **Is this your first** r/kpop **census? -** Interestingly, 64.7% of you said that this is your first ever census here on r/kpop. This could mean that we have a lot of new users since last year, or those that took last years census no longer browse the sub. :( Like last years result, around 18.7% said that they have been around for two or more years. 

# Favorite Groups

Throughout the census there have been two groups fighting neck and neck for the top spot of r/kpops favorite group. And, for the first time, we welcome TWICE to the top of the throne! They were voted by 36.4% of our subreddits users. They just narrowly beat Red Velvet, which were voted by 35.8%. Only 46 votes differentiated these two groups. (The mods may have been taking bets on this in the final days of the census. . .) 

Two groups have dropped out of the top 10 this year. SHINee and BigBang. Last year, SHINee was voted to the 9th place, but has now dropped down to 13th place. BigBang went from 7th place last year to 23rd place. 

That means there are two new groups added to the top 10. We welcome (G)I-DLE and Mamamoo to 7th and 9th place respectively. Last year (G)I-DLE was placed at 15th place and Mamamoo at 11th. 

Other noteworthy bits in the top 10, LOONA and Blackpink swapped their positions for this years results. Girls Generation dropped from 5th place to 10th place since last years results.  


1. TWICE (2933 votes, 36.4%)
2. Red Velvet (2883 votes, 35.8%)
3. BTS (2259 votes, 28%)
4. LOONA ( + OEC + yyxy) (1489 votes, 18.5%)
5. BLACKPINK (1444 votes, 17.9%)
6. NCT (127 + Dream + U + WayV) (1149 votes, 14.3%)
7. (G)I-DLE (1135 votes, 14.1%)
8. EXO (+EXO-CBX) (1090 votes, 13.5%
9. MAMAMOO (1080 votes, 13.4%)
10. Girls Generation (SNSD) (+TTS, Oh!GG) (1058 votes, 13.1%)

# Favorite Soloist

There have been a lot of changes since last years census results for the soloists. For the first time ever, Chungha has taken the first place for favorite solo artist on r/kpop. Last year she was at 4th place. Taeyeon has gone from 2nd place to 4th place. Sunmi climbed from 7th place to 3rd place. Taemin has climbed from 9th place to 5th place.

Some of the new additions to the top 10 soloists are Heize, who climbed from last years 11th place to 9th place. RM went from last years 17th place up to 10th place.   
G-Dragon has dropped out of the top 10 favorite soloists, he previously had the 6th place, now he has the 13th place. The biggest drop was Zico, who was 10th place last year and dropped to 23rd place.

Hyuna, interestingly enough, hasnt released any music since she was part of Triple Hs Retro Future in June of last year. She is the only soloist in the top 10 to have not released any music since the last census.  


1. Chungha (former IOI) (2767 votes, 34.3%)
2. IU (2401 votes, 29.8%)
3. Sunmi (former Wonder Girls) (2118 votes, 26.3%)
4. Taeyeon (Girls Generation) (1650 votes, 20.5%)
5. Taemin (SHINee) (1180 votes, 14.6%)
6. Dean (824 votes, 10.2%)
7. Hyuna (former 4minute) (798 votes, 9.9%)
8. Agust D (Suga) (BTS) (749 votes, 9.3%)
9. Heize (743 votes, 9.2%)
10. RM (Rap Monster) (BTS) (679 votes, 8.4%)

# Final Note 

We updated this years census quite a bit. Its much longer than what you were previously accustomed to, and even though it was longer, we really think having more data is better, so thank you for taking the time out of your day to fill it out.   
Going over the census and revising it was actually a big project for us this year with everything thats happened the past few months.  
Please do let us know if theres anything youd like to see added in the census next year.",476,1098,False,self,,,,,

From being awestruck about everything and literally loving whatever KPOP would offer, over the years I've noticed that I've become slightly more cynical about things. Whether it be because of me being more desensitized and/or gotten more knowledge about the inner workings of KPOP, I've definitely started becoming more opinionated. And I've started to agree with some things that haters spew or at least take what they say into account on a daily basis and noticed that some people in fandoms purposefully don't talk about topics that are completely valid to be criticized. 

Now this does not mean that I don't understand that the things haters say really are not meant to be constructive criticism as most of these ""opinions"" are laced with toxic rhetoric. I should make that clear.

I.e questioning the fact about how much *X* actually contributes musically to the group. Or if their music could be less compromised if *X* weren't ""forced"" to do things they do not excel at.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm very curious if others feel the same, have any of you ever experienced this where you agree with a ""hater"" or a ""unpopular"" opinion about your own fave group? 

*You don't need to go into details about it or even what group they're referring to as this post is not meant to incite mindless hate towards any. The purpose of this post is only to bring forth a healthy discussion, so be respectful and be mindful of your words.*",71,45,False,self,,,,,

So if you want to give it a listen it will be on [Mixlr.com/kust-radio/](https://Mixlr.com/kust-radio/) .  My show will play on Fridays from 11 pm to 1 am (Central Standard Time here in the US), 12 am to 2 am (Eastern Standard Time in the US), 10 pm to 12 am (Pacific Standard Time in the US).

Or do we call it ending when a new group is starting to outsell and become more popular than the most popular group of a current generation? Did 2nd gen officially end when EXO was Number 1 and outselling them or was it over after certain amount of years? People always say that 3rd Gen started 2012 with EXO debut, would the same be true had EXO not become a success? Or are they saying that because the allotted time of each gen has passed? So will the 3rd gen end once groups start outselling current 3rd gen leaders BTS,EXO, Twice and Seventeen? It has been abt 7yrs since 3rd gen has begun, and they are still top groups.

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

I am a graduate student who is hoping to do research on gender and sexual identity in Korean media. My current research centers around Amber and her androgynous image in K-pop. Although I am not making any assumptions on Amber's gender or sexual identity, what I am hoping to understand is the interactions with or around Amber's music and image. I hope to speak with fans or spectators of K-pop, who are willing to talk about their own sexual and gender identity and their interactions with Amber as an artist and her music.

My hope is not to make any assumptions on anyone's gender or sexual identity. In addition, I do not mean to insult or cause harm to anyone who may comment or participate in this research. I do want to emphasis that your names will not be used, rather I will use a nickname or an alias that either I can choose or you can choose for yourself. 

If by chance anyone would like to participate or ask any questions about this research you can pm me on Reddit and I will give you my email.

Even though her range isn't as exquisite as it used to be (her tone remains as melodious and tender yet she can't belt the way she used to), Solji's voice continues to be among the strongest ones in Kpop. Before she even joined Exid, she was a singing teacher. 

The singers in Mamamoo except for Moonbyul. Wheein and Solar have incredible, dramatic voices. Hwasa's voice stands out more due to how distinctive it is as well as her versatility. If there is any singer who could have a successful career by herself, my answer would be Hwasa.

Sojung (Ladies' Code). She has the best vibrato in the industry. Her voice is insanely precious and rich. She can go from a more intimate, quiet tone to suddenly belt out a song with sheer drive which is scarce for a singer with the type of voice she has. 

Ros (Blackpink). Whenever I listen to Blackpink, I can always tell which parts Ros sings due to how different her voice is. It's nasal and strong yet velvety . She's the one singer in Blackpink I'm most waiting to see come out with her own EP.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

I have two favorite producers, Sweetune and Brave Brothers.

The Sweetune sound has always been and will always be one of the best in the industry. Everything theyve done has been golden and theyve produced multiple title tracks for Kara, Infinite and 9muses.
All the songs has that retro feel you cant help but love and their best work imo is Pandora by Kara, The Chaser by Infinite, Gun by 9muses and A by Rainbow.

Brave Brothers also has a close to impeccable discography, producing a multitude of hits for AOA, 4minute and Sistar. Its kind of hard to put into words how a Brave Brothers song sounds but they all have something distinctive that makes it obvious its by the same producer, something youll notice if you listen to multiple of the songs after each other.
My favorite songs by him is Deepened by Brave Girls, Full Moon by Sunmi and Someone Like U by Dalshabet.",111,107,False,self,,,,,

If anyone has links to actual round circular glasses like the ones I will link, that will be helpful!

Note: I do have prescription glasses, so if you can share a link of round circular glasses with options for prescriptions for eyesight and astigmatism, that would be great!

TLDR; See title, want to try new style. Need glasses for astigmatism and distance prescription, with option of lens size?

There's a possibility there would be a girl version of Super M (when the said group becomes successful) and I'm curious what would r/kpop's ideal or predicted member lineup

Here's mine:
1) BOA 
Position: main dancer, lead vocal
She's well rounded and she has a huge popularity in japan so i figured she would do great debuting in the U.S.
2) Taeyeon of SNSD
Position: leader, main vocal, visual
Not sure who's older between BOA or Taeyeon but in my opinion Taeyeon can handle the leadership role the best.
3) Luna of f(x)
Position: main dancer, lead vocal
I know she left SM so this just a big WHAT IF. 
4) Krystal of f(x)
Position: lead vocal, face of the group
Another what if she didn't leave SM. She can speak english well and she's so pretty so i figured she'd be a great addition to the group
5) Seulgi
Position: lead dancer, lead vocal, center
I chose her as center because RV is popular in the U.S. and she can capture the audience's attention reallt well. And because she's well rounded.

I only chose 5 girls because I don't want them to be compared as the literal female versions of Taemin, Baekhyun, Kai, Ten, Lucas, Taeyong, and Mark.

Welcome all to this thread! I'm af-fx-tion, a long term user on this subreddit!

So after seeing comments about how best to support their faves digitally, I wanted to provide some information about how international fans can best help their favorite artists even if they don't live in South Korea.

If anyone has any additional information they want to add or update me on a mistake, please feel free to comment!

So let's break things down first:

**What is Bugs?**

Bugs! is a South Korean subscription streaming service similar to Spotify, Apple Music, etc. 

**I see Melon linked in all the album threads, why can't I use that over Bugs?**

Well, Melon is the biggest music streaming service in Korea, so it makes sense why it's linked in the OPs. However, it's extremely difficult for international fans to sign up for the service due to needing a Korean phone number to complete registration. Bugs!, while not as big as Melon, is super easy for international fans to sign up for. Plus, it offers pretty much the same service *and* its' data is also used for the same things Melon's is used for. So having Bugs! doesn't mean you're going to not be able to help your faves.

**What are those things that Bugs! data is used for?**

So Bugs is one of the major streaming services that Gaon compiles data from in order to rank songs on the Gaon music charts. Gaon also use the data to provide certifications for both song downloads and song streaming.

So, when you see songs ranking on Gaon singles and streaming charts, they took data from Bugs! (among other streaming services like Melon) to calculate those rankings. Same goes for Gaon certifications for meeting thresholds in both streaming and downloads.

Data from Bugs! is also used to calculate the digital score for all music shows awards (i.e. The Show, Inkigayo, M! Countdown, Show Champion, Music Bank).

**Wait, you said Bugs! and other streaming services only count on the song related charts/certs. Why not album charts/certs?**

So Gaon does not have a digital album chart because streaming services offer each song on the album as an individual download. So technically these sites are providing a set of singles, not 1 album.

Thus, the data is not used in calculating numbers for Gaon album charts or certifications.

**Okay, so I want to sign up for Bugs!, how do I do that?**

7Dreamers [wrote a great guide](https://7-dreamers.com/support/tutorials/how-to-create-a-bugs-account-and-stream/) to sign up for Bugs! on both Android and Apple devices. While there is a signup option on the Bugs! website, unfortunately it requires a Korean phone number to complete the sign up process.

So as of now, the sign up process only works via handheld devices.

However, once you've signed up, you can log into your account [via the web browser](https://music.bugs.co.kr/) and other supported devices easily.

**How much does Bugs! cost, and what do I get?**

So Bugs! operates on a monthly billing cycle, and will bill you the same day every month (so if you start your subscription on the 9th, you will be billed on the 9th of every month). However, there is the option to only purchase a single month of service.

The tiers that Bugs offers (plus prices!) are follows:

**Streaming + Saving on Smartphone - 10,900 Won/Month**

* Unlimited storage on smartphones and tablets
* Supports streaming on all devices including PC + mobile, AI speakers

**Streaming - 7,900 Won/Month**

* Supports streaming on all devices including PC + mobile, AI speakers

**Streaming (Phone Only) - 6,900 Won/Month**

* Supports all devices that support the Bugs mobile app

**Streaming Premium - 12,000 Won/Month**

* Unlimited listening in CD-quality lossless streaming at 16 bit FLAC
* Supports streaming on all devices including PC + mobile, AI speakers

**Streaming + Download 30 Songs/Month - 12,900 Won/Month**

* Download 30 MP3s per month (downloaded songs last forever)
* Supports streaming on all devices including PC + mobile, AI speakers

**Streaming + Download 65 Songs/Month - 16,900 Won/Month**

* Download 65 MP3s per month (downloaded songs last forever)
* Supports streaming on all devices including PC + mobile, AI speakers

**Streaming + Download 100 Songs/Month - 23,900 Won/Month**

* Downloaded 100 MP3s per month (downloaded songs last forever)
* Supports streaming on all devices including PC + mobile, AI speakers

**Download 30 Songs/Month - 8,900 Won/Month**

* Download 30 MP3s per month (downloaded songs last forever)

**Download 65 Songs/Month - 12,900 Won/Month**

* Download 65 MP3s per month (downloaded songs last forever)

**Download 100 Songs/Month - 19,900 Won/Month**

* Download 100 MP3s per month (downloaded songs last forever)

Please note that these prices are the same if you just want to buy the services for one month.

**What type of payment do they accept?**

Based on my experience, international credit cards should definitely work. Not too sure about debit cards, though.

**Cool! What formats do Bugs! support?**

Bugs! general streaming supports up to AAC 320kbps while premium supports up to 16 bit FLAC. However, please note that currently Bugs! doesn't support FLAC downloading.

**Anything else I need to know?**

As I only subscribe to the Streaming - 7,900 Won/Month tier, I can't speak to any of the other tiers in terms of the specific terms. **SO PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ THE TOS/SPECIFICS BEFORE SUBSCRIBING TO A SPECIFIC TIER.**

However, one thing the TOS makes clear is that any passes with a download option do not support the carrying over of any unused downloads into the next month. So for example, if you paid for the Download 100 Songs/Month pass but only downloaded 50 that month, you will not have 150 downloads next month, but 100. You will have lost those 50 download opportunities from the previous month.

They also state that download only passes may limit the amount of songs a user is able to listen to/stream on the site for free.

**Does Bugs! have other music besides Korean music?**

Yes they do! Bugs! is not a KR only music portal but has songs from all around the world! All you need to is click """" on the homepage to get songs from ""overseas"". KR music would be under """".

**Anything last minute you want to add?**

You can save the songs you like to your account and put them in folders, and easily create your own playlists (there's a web player option too!)

Also, even if you are over 19 years old, you will be unable to listen to 19+ rated songs easily. According the blurb the site gives, KR law requires a certificate/confirmation thing confirming your age, but it can't be done without a KR phone number. Thus, even putting in your birth date to prove you are over 19 isn't enough.

That's really the only small quibble though!

**Thanks for reading until the end, and happy streaming!**",61,237,False,self,,,,,

But whenever more nuanced reporting and more independent research is needed when more serious things / controversies happen, these news outlets' shortcomings really show through. Being an English-speaking kpop fan that can't read Korean, I don't even know where I would even start to look if I wanted to verify anything from these articles. I can only sort of do this indirectly by looking for Chinese language articles that are covering the same events bc I can read Chinese. A lot of times, I notice that the English articles are missing relevant information, or have different details entirely from the Chinese articles. Particularly when they are covering things about kpop activities in China, they really tend to get a lot of the details wrong. 

So sometimes it's frustrating to see people take English reports as facts and spread misinformation. But I also know it's hard for every single person to do their own independent research. The other issue is that sometimes fans that may know some Korean may post more details about a story that they've found, but it's also hard to judge if these fans are sharing accurate info or just sharing info that support their assumptions and leaving out other details. I do think it's an issue at least when it comes to spreading misinformation and causing things to spiral out of control. 

Any thoughts on this? Do you think maybe it's bc most of these news sites are profit driven (click-bait-y), and there just isn't enough of a demand and profitability for the type of ""serious"" journalism that requires more work and time? How do you all try to find reliable info as people that might not know Korean? Like I said I try to verify things by looking for Chinese articles, but those can be suspect too.",18,149,False,self,,,,,

A place to talk about new and/or underrated Kpop groups/soloists/bands and share information, performance videos, etc.  [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/de80rk/nugu_roundup_14_chicken_noodle_soup_with_a_lime/).

Every so often I'll hear a song that completely catches me off-guard.  Something so fresh, so new, so different that I can't help but fall for a group.  That recently happened to me with this week's featured group - Hey Girls!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Hey Girls (Formerly Black Queen)**

**Who are they?:** A five member girl group under Moai Entertainment.  They began as a dance group back in 2008 as Black Queen, but rebranded as Hey Girls in 2016.  It's a bit unclear if any of the original 2008 line-up remains, I've seen conflicting claims about the group's leader Jandi, some saying she was an original member, some saying she joined for their 2012 original music debut, some saying she joined in 2016, it could be two different Jandis or she could have left and returned, but she and Main Rapper Siyeon were Black Queen members before the rebranding.

**Company:** Moai Entertainment appears to be a small company with Hey Girls as their only promoted group, although according to their website the company also does production work and commercial/advertising jingles.

 **Members:**

**Debut:**  This is where things get a bit complicated, as there are three potential debut songs

* October 19th, 2012 with Good Girl ([Short MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuH3r7FyGe0)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3vT0JpdwNY))
* February 3rd, 2016 with Nolja ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVoR4eJ6ceU), sort of) Performance Version ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-RV1qv95wQ)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGlA1U7R0mk))  This is sort of a transitional song between the two groups.  It's technically the 2nd single by Black Queen (four years after their first) but came immediately before the group rebranded as Hey Girls, so it was also to help throw them back into the spotlight, and it appears as a B-Side on their first single album as Hey Girls.  This is also the song that made me fall for this group - it's a bizarre mash-up of Carmina Burana-esque chants, Miss-A-esque 2nd-gen sexy vocals, a weird but cool trap dance break that has nothing to do with the rest of the song, and Euro-disco.  It's right up there with SNSD's IGAB in terms of abrupt stylistic shifts, and I've never heard anything quite like it.
* November 20th, 2017 with No One But You ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFYl8CNmCgY)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNjrmkwVwJA)) This one also feels a bit 2nd-gen inspired, but in a good way, a remarkably mature sound, I love the 'do you love me' parts

**Most Recent Comeback:**  October 30th, 2018 with Yoo-Hoo-Hoo ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ah-IUOoiAE)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeDouUu1sLI)) I get major Sistar vibes from this, but it's cute and fun

**Other MVs and Live Performances:**

* Follow Me ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaQdrx8py38)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmCMPALpdhc)) A smooth and slick sexy/goofy duality song with a fun MV lampooning social media
* Nog-Yeojwo (which apparently translates roughly to 'Melt It' or 'Melting') ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5txlQDoFsw)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5kccKN0So0)) Another Sistar-esque song, but summery and playful with a classic Kpop feel that you don't hear quite as often anymore.

**Trivia:**  I searched quite a bit but I can't find ages for any of the member, a bit odd but they seem to be hiding them.  I have a feeling Jandi is quite a bit older than the rest of the members due to her probably debuting with Black Queen back towards their original debut, but again there's a bit of mystery there.  In any event she still looks great and some maturity in leadership is never a bad thing.  I fell into a bit a of a rabbit hole with this group as they have a lot of content as both Black Queen and Hey Girls, and most of it is amazing.  I recommend checking out their YouTube Channel and if you want to Google for other stuff the Hangul for Black Queen is '' and for Hey Girls is '' which can turn up more results than just searching their English names.

**Active Between:** October 20th, 2016 - January 18th, 2018

**Reason for disbandment:** Starting in mid-2017 members starting to leave the group, starting with Hyungyeon citing health concerns after receiving backlash from BTS fans who felt she spoke rudely and too casually about them.  Fellow members Sora and Say both left later in the year, only leaving 2 behind.  It was announced the group would go on temporary hiatus, but disbandment was announced in 2018 after leader Kimi started a solo career.

**Trivia:** Four of the five members were Produce alumni.  Leader Kimi was a former member of disbanded group Scarlet, and left to start a solo career afterwards and has released two songs, the last in 2018.  The three members who left Bulldok early have all joined the new group Peace.  The remaining member, Lee Jin Hee, does not appear to be active in the industry currently.

##Setting All-Time Records Rules

Alright! The [Charts and Achievements: The re-re-re-redux!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d0ueyn/charts_and_achievements_the_rerereredux/) discussion has been active for the last month. Thank you all who have made your voices heard so far. Many of you provided detailed and thorough responses, which has been a huge help in getting a better impression for what direction we should go. Cheers!

Firstly, the `[Achievement]` flair now exists! It is tied into the News category. Some of you have already started using it, which is awesome! It should be fairly instinctive, but don't hesitate to ask for any clarification of where it is appropriate! This flair has been added to the 'Hide News/Rumors' filter in the Old reddit sidebar. If you use Reddit Enhancement Suite, you can now easily add this to your filteReddit settings if you don't want to see any achievement posts going forward.

I hope it will be obvious from how broad the spectrum of opinion is that we are not going to make everyone happy, but the most common sentiment from the community is to be quite relaxed about All-Time Records. As moderators, we are in agreement that having less restriction here makes sense for the subreddit and, since they are rarer events, will not overwhelm us with excessive content. The smaller, common, general achievements will still need some work and it makes sense to keep more limitations there. But for these biggest records, many lean towards a free-for-all within some reasonable guidelines.

With that consideration, we have drawn up the following list:

### All-Time Records:

**!Important: This list is not comprehensive and is not totally subject to the 'no-exceptions' rule unlike our general achievements rules, but it should provide a foundational guideline for the kinds of records we want to allow.**

**Sales, pre-orders, views, charting, pre-orders**

* Greatest selling album of all time
* Greatest cumulative album sales for an artist 
* Greatest pre-orders for an album
* Greatest sales/pre-orders as a foreign artist (see Notes below)
* Most viewed MV (see Notes below)
* Most views in 24 hours (see Notes below)
* Most charted #1s for an artist
* Longest continuously charting song (Only when the top record is broken or the song leaves the charts)

**Music shows**

* Most music show wins for one song
* Most cumulative music show wins for an artist
* Fastest time (days) to a music show win after debut for an artist
* Longest time (days) to a music show win after debut for an artist

**Touring, box-office**

These records are tricky since numbers can be difficult to calculate or track down. We would prefer these to be compiled in a Tour Review Round-Up, but if something has strong data backing it, we will likely allow them for gross numbers. 

* Highest tour revenue
* Highest box-office earnings for a K-pop related movie

&amp;nbsp;

**Notes:**

* Music Video Records:
    * Views can be counted including multiple official uploads (eg. the artist's official channel, their company's channel, and/or a distributor channel), BUT should ONLY be for the main video. Alternative versions, dance practices, mirrored versions, etc, should not be included.
    * Please wait for an official confirmation from YouTube since view-counts can change quite dramatically! The smaller/general MV milestones can go by screenshots or articles, but for the All-Time ones, we'd like to get that official confirmation. If a few days pass and there is still no confirmation, we will make sure to allow a post anyway.
* For foreign sales/pre-orders, we might want to restrict this to the USA and Japan. We'll try leaving it open for now and see how it goes.
* Time-frame records: The primary things we will be restricting for All-Time Records are based on limited time-frames. We want to stick with milestones by numbers, not by time. So, records like 'highest sales ever in 1 day, 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, etc, we would prefer to not allow. The 'Most views in 24-hours' one is the only exception.

&amp;nbsp;

We ask that you keep the spirit of a more relaxed attitude in mind along with a thoughtfulness about what news and information serves the subreddit. Some who are unhappy with less restriction may try to test the moderators by posting obscure All-Time Records that go far into the weeds (eg. The highest album sales on the 3rd day of the month from a girl group from the 2nd generation). Please understand that the content in this subreddit is almost entirely driven by you, the community. If content is not interesting to you, please don't post it just to prove you can or to manipulate moderators.

At any given time, there are probably hundreds, maybe thousands, of pieces of content that could be posted to this subreddit that fit within our current rules. So much that the subreddit would become flooded and unusable if users exploited every possible gap just for the sake of it. Writing rules to close every gap would make the rules so unbearably long and tedious that both users and mods would give up on participating in this community. We already find it challenging to keep up with the current rules and would like to open things up more in areas that don't generate enormous amounts of content, but when users take advantage of more relaxation for karma or spite or whatever the case may be, the subreddit suffers as a whole.

**Please primarily stick with simpler categories for these big records: Female Group, Male Group, Female soloist, Male soloist, and Co-ed duos/groups.**

###Decision-making

Moderators will use some discretion to remove All-Time Records that are reaching for every qualification that can be stacked together to make a unique case or anything that is too obscure to be worthy of a post.

To make these decisions, as well as for any records we haven't included or thought of previously, we will go with the most requested option chosen by users in the Achievements discussion, which is to have an internal vote among the moderators. We might have been less comfortable with this when we only had a few active mods, but now we have a bigger pool with diverse opinions, so we are less likely to have split decisions. We may give the decision a mention in the following Town Hall, *especially* if it stirred up any conflict or controversy, so you will be able to see our reasoning or chime in yourselves.

###Retroactive Records

**PLEASE DO NOT IMMEDIATELY POST ANY RECORDS BROKEN IN THE LAST 5 MONTHS THAT ARE NOW ALLOWED!**

In the Achievements discussion, we didn't get much consensus for how to handle posting retroactive records. The two main methods folks suggested were to allow a free-for-all for a day or two OR do a special version of our Weekly Charts and Achievements threads where we can work together to compile all the records into the main post. We're thinking this second option might be best to start off with. Then once we have a set of records, we can decide if it's not too much for a free-for-all. Or we can set up a bot to post them one at a time.

We'll host that compilation post as soon as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

##General Achievements Notes

For the most part, the rules we've had for the more common achievements since earlier in the year are unchanged. They haven't caused any terrible upset, so there is no reason to do anything drastic right away. That 2nd poll may still come in the future with the help of your suggestions to format the options.

There are a few small changes we would like to try out:

**MV view milestones:**

* *Old rule: Every 100 mil views to infinity*
* **New rule: 25M, 100M-900M (every 100M), 1B-infinity (every 500M)**

So, this is 25 million as the first milestone, 100 million, then every 100 million up to 900 million, 1 billion, then every 500 million to infinity. The 'FIRST TIME ONLY AT EACH MILESTONE' rule still applies.

(For groups debuting from big companies or with lots of hype, they are likely to hit multiple milestones in quick succession. Please hold off making a post at every milestone. Let the first surge of views pass before posting about the highest milestone they reached.)

**GaOn Triple Crowns and Certifications:**

* *Old rule: GaOn Triple Crowns and Certifications (FIRST TIME FOR AN ARTIST ONLY)*
* **New rule: GaOn Triple Crowns can be posted any time they are achieved**
* **New rule: All certifications (Silver in the UK, Gold, Platinum, Diamond) can be posted any time they are achieved**, but announcements of **eligibility can NOT be posted** unless backed up with significant, reliably-sourced data (ie. Nielsen Music).

We will be monitoring these closely to see if they cause any issues. Again, the General Achievements will still require some work and experimentation, and possibly a poll, so please be patient as that evolves. These rules will be the most subject to change and adjustment. We will continue to welcome [feedback in the discussion post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d0ueyn/charts_and_achievements_the_rerereredux/ezdn2l5/?st=k09ez98m&amp;sh=4ba7315e) The 'no exceptions' rule will be implemented with these more common milestones in the meantime.

&amp;nbsp;

**All of these changes are now reflected in [the rules wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules) along with the addition of [a dedicated Achievements wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/achievements) that has more of the expanded information discussed above.**

&amp;nbsp;

##Discussing Leaks and Merch Posts

This issue of leaks came up related to 'Jopping', which included a little confusion on our end. Typically, we have allowed content leaks to be posted, like songs or music video snippets. We'd like a little feedback from the community about this. **Would you like us to remove any posts or shared links of leaked content? Or would you prefer these to be allowed?**

&amp;nbsp;

Merchandise for K-Pop artists is being released all the time, so we probably don't want a flood of posts. Usually we've allowed merch posts when it is directly related to a comeback/release or if the content includes the artists themselves. To use a popular example, there is a steady stream of merch with BTS's BT21 characters. We don't allow posts for whenever there's a new set of clothing, phone cases, office supplies, etc, but we *did* allow posts for the BT21 videos with [BTS themselves creating/discussing the characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b97f3h/bts_%EB%B0%A9%ED%83%84%EC%86%8C%EB%85%84%EB%8B%A8_the_past_1_bt21_universe_190404_eng_sub/).

Here are more examples of merch-related posts that have been allowed:

* [Red Velvet - The ReVe Festival Day 2: Wall Scroll Poster (Official Merchandise Packaging Preview)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/d91y68/red_velvet_the_reve_festival_day_2_wall_scroll/)
* [CLC - ME () (Official Merchandise Preview - Photocards)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/budimo/clc_me_%E7%BE%8E_official_merchandise_preview_photocards/)
* [Official KCON 2019 LA Merchandise (Pre Sale Starts Today At 5PM PDT)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/chtmoz/official_kcon_2019_la_merchandise_pre_sale_starts/)
* [EXO-CBX x MARVEL collab for Japan ConcertEXO-CBX MAGICAL CIRCUS 2019 -Special Edition- Merchandise](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bbpmxi/exocbx_x_marvel_collab_for_japan_concertexocbx/)
* [SM Artists (BoA, TVXQ, Super Junior, SNSD, SHINee, f(x), EXO, Red Velvet, NCT 127, NCT Dream) - Official Merch (Preview)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cpscr3/sm_artists_boa_tvxq_super_junior_snsd_shinee_fx/)

So, **we'd like your feedback about merch in general**. Should there be any limitations here? Should merch posts always be allowed it they include the images/names of artists? Should they be directly related to comeback promotions? Should event/convention merch always be allowed? What about pop-up store announcements? Is this something we shouldn't be concerned about and mostly allow everything?

&amp;nbsp;

##YouTube Premiere Links

We have rules about 'jumping-the-gun' with some kinds of content, which allow the moderators to make a call when there are competing posts. It was brought to our attention that between mods and users we weren't on the same page with understanding what to do with videos posted in YouTube's Premiere format. We enforce a tight rule for music videos, since big drop-times can be harrowing on our end with many posters competing to be the first. That rule looks like this:

&gt; **Music Videos:** Most major MVs are released at the same time of day (6:00 PM KST). When it is a popular artist, there is a race among many users to be the first to post the MV. To make this race easier to moderate, we maintain a 'no jumping-the-gun' rule. The music video should only be posted on or after the hour of release. Moderators will check the timestamp. Even if the official channel releases the music video a few minutes before the hour, even if a link is available early due to a YouTube Premiere setting, DO NOT post the video before 6:00 PM KST.

This applies to any music videos at scheduled drop times. However, we have not enforced this 'jumping-the-gun' rule for other video content, like variety shows or vlogs, since it's usually not a big deal and there are rarely multiple users competing to post the same content. We've learned that some assumed the same rule applied to *all* Premiere-formatted videos, so we should sort that out, especially since they are increasingly common and often scheduled many hours or even days ahead of time.

Options:

* We can apply the exact same rule that we apply to Premiere-formatted music videos:
    * *As long as* the video is posted on or after the scheduled hour of release...
    * You may post videos while they are in Premiere-mode
    * And the video can still have a countdown at the time of posting (this is typical and usually only lasts a couple minutes)
* Do not allow Premiere-formatted videos until they have played through all the way and are no longer in the Premiere-mode. This option would be near impossible to enforce since some videos are very long and would require mods to watch every video to see when it ends and a post can be made.
* Allow Premiere-formatted videos more freely, but set some limit on how early they can be posted. 15 minutes? 5 minutes? 1 hour?

From the mod perspective, we're a little apprehensive to add the same rule we have for MVs to other Premiere content. We usually make sure at least one mod is watching the queue right at major MV drop times, since that's where the issue of competing posts was generated. But other video content is posted at much more varied times. So for example, if a user posts a Premiere video a few minutes before the scheduled hour, but no mods see it for a while, and no other users try to post that content, we wouldn't necessarily want to remove that post retroactively once it has been up for so long *just* to enforce this rule. But even if we set a more relaxed time limit, *that* will become the new contentious time for competing posters. That being said, we recognize someone posting a video link hours before it premieres just because the link is available is not ideal.

Thoughts?

&amp;nbsp;

##Editorializing Titles

A small reminder! If you feel a title is misleading, has misinformation, or does not represent the content of the article, you can contact a moderator to change the title before posting. Editorializing without review is still banned. We have our /r/kpop discord with a channel to ask in, as well as mod mail. We'll do our best to get back to you as fast as possible so we can create a title together that better serves the community.

&amp;nbsp;

##Inappropriate Conduct

If you feel a user is behaving in a way that is inappropriate regarding language or content that could trigger others or content that is inappropriate, please let us know via mod mail. We will investigate and take action on it. Please note we cannot take action based on word of mouth. We will need evidence of the user's activity in our subreddit ecosystem to do so. Otherwise, the user should be reported to the reddit admins.

&amp;nbsp;

Sulli of the K-pop band, f(x) had taken her life for the same reason. She has being facing so much of criticism and hate that she had resort to suicide.
She was criticized for being visually unappealing, her lazy dancing and worst of all for being a feminist.She had posted a letter on her IG asking people to leave her alone. 
Now what I want to ask the haters is ""What  satisfaction do you get by criticizing people on such trivial matters?""
Yes we all have the right to criticize idols for the mistakes they make but that doesn't give us the right to misuse the social media for undermining people. We all make mistakes. None of us are perfect. It is really immature to criticise someone on basis of one's looks or body. 
Sulli was a great woman, an amazing actress, a talented idol and most of all a good human being. She deserved to live a happy life. Sadly that is no longer possible.

Does anyone have any advice for wanting to start a K-pop group? I'm (obviously) not part of the industry, I'm only a film student in the UK at the moment, but I love music and Kpop itself.

I know it would probably be insanely difficult for me to even try, but do you have any advice? 

I wouldn't part of the group (only managing) as I'm not Korean (I can't sing, rap or dance either) and I know its pretty offensive or 'piss-taking' if I was part of it.

It would be an all-girl group inspired by groups like Blackpink, Everglow, Itzy, CLC, Red Velvet, Twice, Mamamoo, AOA, Rocket Punch and Cherry Bullet.

I don't expect the group to suddenly blow up and rival groups like BP or Twice (not even close as I have nothing compared to them and their companies), but... just to try?

Thanks!",1,0,False,self,,,,,

Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. for the sake of time, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So no live, remix, or free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating
5. Be back on thursday to check for translation

She couldn't speak up on major topics that meant something to her without people belittling her input. (i.e., her stance on feminism). Tragically this list goes on and on. That beautiful woman could not live her life to the fullest because she was constantly being ""reminded"", by those who know nothing of her character, that her life was not worth anything! Is that not the most disgusting thing for a individual to speak of another person's life? I'm honestly so confused how someone can go around saying that she doesn't have the right to her own life because she doesn't meet up to your standards.


 NEWS FLASH!!! YOU DON'T EVEN MEET UP TO YOUR OWN STANDARDS! WHY TF DOES SHE HAVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF HAPPINESS YOU HAVE IN YOUR OWN MISERABLE LIVES!?!  

Oh... Wait. That's right, SHE DOESN'T!! 

There truly needs to be some type of reform in the way idol ""culture"" is handled. Some people can argue that this is the life that these artists are signing up for and that if they can't handle it then they shouldn't be an idol... But how can you stop a person from living their dream and fulfilling their passion? We can't. It's as simple as that. Also this isn't the life they signed up for, this is the life we as 'fans' are allowing them to have. We are letting these spiteful individuals tear down our idols because we keep reinforcing that this is what comes with fame. Backing someone up against the wall and choking them into believing that the only way to get free is by suicide is not what comes with fame. 

What they signed up for is getting to do the things they love for a living. Having the chance to inspire and help others with the work they put SO much time and effort into. These people are signing up for living the life they've always dreamed about ever since they were young. They are signing up for helping their families by being a provider. That is what they are signing up for...

Sadly this is the second artist under SM entertainment to pass away in the span of five years I believe. Shinee's Kim Jonghyun passed away I believe two years ago. Honestly his passing is something I have still yet to come to terms with. I loved Jonghyun quite a bit and it truly pains me to speak about his passing. This is why I completely understand what F(x) fans are going through rn. When your favorite artist leaves this world there is a place in your heart that is left empty. I know myself as an individual could not have saved his life, but I can't help the feeling of 'If only I...' 

SM needs to make some changes in how they handle the care of their idols, trainees and their employees. Mental health check ups should be regulated and protection against bullying/defamation needs to take priority. I know lately their have been plenty of companies taking action against these things, but I just feel that it's not working quick enough. Obviously, this is me speaking as an outsider who doesn't understand the way the industry works. 

I feel like we also need to get rid of that ownership way of thinking with fans. We do not own these artists. We are not entitled to how these people live their lives. They are not dolls that we puppeteer. They are living and breathing human beings who have dreams of starting families one day. They have dreams of falling in love with someone. It is crazy how one can feel like they can dictate how someone, whom they've never met, should live their lives. It's their lives, not yours.


 PERIODT. 

IDK how many will take the time to read this and if it will even reach anyone besides myself. I honestly just needed to get these things off my chest before I exploded. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope my message got across clearly. Please pray for the family and friends who have lost their loved one today. Also to the fans out there... Please stay strong, grieve and heal. Have a blessed day. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Two of the members, Sujeong and Jiae, had to reach out to fans and address the malicious comments during a VLive broadcast

Jiae said, Until now, I did not care muchabout malicious comments.However, [the comments about Queendom] had a huge effect on us because theywere personal attacks of our lives.

Sujeong added, It doesnt matter what kind of criticism they make, but we had a hard time because they denounced the lives of each Lovelyz memberdue to that one performance.Sujeong continuedby asking viewers to refrain from discussing the personal lives of the members and to not discredit Lovelyzs achievements just because of the one performance.

As a long time Lovelinus I can assure everyone that they've been getting a disproportionate amount of hate comments since the day they debuted, and that is troubling for the state of the fandom since we worry a lot for the girls. 

Additionally, one of the members was a target of a made up scandal early in their careers, it affected her deeply but she's been able to make it through thanks to the group members, her family and the fans. 

I really believe, in light of the recent event, that we as k-pop fans should reach out to the 8 members of Lovelyz and let them know that they're loved and appreciated and that the hate comments are worth NOTHING",3,1,False,self,,,,,

It's just that I haven't slept in days and my mind has been going a mile a minute since the news broke early yesterday morning. I've been reading all the articles, comments, and doing research on older material, and I'm still struggling to piece things together.

I'll admit that f(x)'s promotions were before my time in the K-pop fandom, but despite that, I grew very attached to Sulli the last few years. So now that this has happened, I'm just trying to understand why.

The furthest back instance of backlash I've heard of was in 2013 I believe, where she made a joke or comment in Chinese on a variety show, or something along those lines. Was this the beginning, a continuing issue, or an unrelated incident? It's safe to say either way that she was a target for quite some time.

Let's go back further though. If my information is correct, she debuted as an actress in 2005, and as a member of f(x) 4 years later. She was just 15 at the time. She took a hiatus from the group (that would become permanent) in 2014 due to bullying and hate online. She was 20 years old. What happened in this time? Here's my theory; She grew up. Five years is long, looong time for a person during those formative years. You are definitely not the same person at 20 as you were at 15. Hell, you're probably pretty different at 20 than you were at 18.

So I guess she was, like, ""the cute one"" in the group, but as she grew up, she developed her own opinions and beliefs, and decided how she wanted to live her life instead of just going with the flow like teenagers do. I guess people didn't like that. She was openly feminist and opinionated, and not just ""the cute one"" anymore. Am I reading too much into it? I mean, I remember people being pissed that Irene read a feminist book a while back, so I kind of get the feeling South Korea is pretty set in the old ways, for lack of a better term. So is that it? They hated her because she was a feminist? It has to be more than that, right? I haven't found anything about any real scandals in her career, so I don't know what to make of this. The ""worst"" things I can find about her are that she dated an older guy, did that one movie with nude scenes, and didn't wear a bra from time to time. I'm just thinking ""so what, is that it?"" It just doesn't make any sense to me.

I know it's not my place to drudge up the past, and it's really none of my business, but I can't help it. Not knowing feels like it's eating away at me from the inside. Like, I need to put the pieces together in order to understand and see how it can be prevented in the future. It's also important to note that she suffered from Depression for some time, and we don't know exactly what it was that made her make this decision, and likely never will. I just need to know the outside perspective from over the years.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Some of my ideas are:

	Unionize idols and trainees to give them more leverage to negotiate better working conditions

	Employer paid comprehensive mental health care including medication

	Less individual public social media accounts, more group social media accounts thats managed by a social media manager

	Idol peer support groups thats moderated by a mental health professional

	Mandatory minimum of 20 or more vacation days per year (not including weekends)

	In 2018, new legislation was introduced in South Korea that reduced the 68 hour workweek to 52 (40 hour regular work, 12 hour overtime) and public holidays were paid days off, and the maximum working hours for minors was reduced to 40 hours per week, correct me if Im wrong but this does not seem to be heavily enforced? Is there currently a centralized body that audits companies for how many hours their employees are forced to work? If not, I think one should be established

	Mandatory mental health first aid training during trainee period (Overview of common psychological disorders, causes and treatments, tips on how to help someone, etc.)

	Not just training on languages during trainee, but also training on racism and cultural appropriation

They are always saying ""I will work harder, be better"" etc. The balance between working hard but also acknowledge when you have deserved and should rest is very unbalanced imo. And the harder one group works, the harder next group has to work in order to match that. And so it continues, it just keeps pushing and pushing. 

You hear about idols taking medication for pain relief to be able to preform, instead of resting. They faint, they eat and sleep less then they shuld. They rarely see their family. They can't date. It's not healthy beeing pushed like this. 

We constantly hear about idols struggling with mental issues, some even die from it. And I'm SCARED. 

I can't watch kpop content anymore without feeling stressed. I feel stressed when groups have shows everyday. They do dance preformances, talkshows, radio, fan meetings, vlogs etc you know what I mean. Some go on worldtours and releases a new album at the same time. One day they are in LA and the next in Seoul. I don't understand how they have time for everything. Your normal western artists may drop a album once every 2-3 years and have 1 world tour, while kpop groups may drop 3 albums (shorter but anyways) and 1 world tour in 1 year.

I'm having a hard time enjoying SuperM. They (no hate against the boys I love them all) feel like a good example on how money driven SM are. While Sulli was dying they had all their focus on making as much money as possible in USA. 

I love kpop with all my heart, that's why I'm starting to feel like I can't support this industry anymore. I know not all companies treat their idols bad etc. But it's to hard to know. And I think the biggest probem is the mentality of things like this in korea, that you have to be perfect and successfull and work hard (hard as in way to hard) every day.  Maybe a decrese in kpop popularity might start a discussion there. For as it seems now, kpop growing in popularity in the west, that's only going to fuel the industry.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I only got into K-Pop in 2013, so I pretty much missed their peak, which was, as some say, around 2003-2010. We often hear about 2nd gen groups like SNSD, BIGBANG, 2NE1 and Wonder Girls as the most influential in K-Pop, but somehow I never hear/read that much about ""older"" acts such as TVXQ or BoA. I know they were huge in Asia, but since they didn't get that much media coverage in the West is hard for me to get an accurate perception of their impact. 

Could you tell me something about that? Is their fame comparable to any current group/soloist (even though K-Pop has changed so much)?

So, Ive been steadily watching the situation with SuperM and their controversial way of getting to #1 on the albums chart and its been a rather... bazaar beast to watch grow and twist into something I didnt think would happen. First, lets talk about the Buzzfeed article that went viral. The original article claimed a lot (Ex: they purposely misquoted Forbes about how album sales work and then lied about the source and said SM said it when they didnt), and its added gas to an already burning bonfire.

For a full link of the things that were factually wrong in the Buzzfeed article that went viral, [here ya go!](https://twitter.com/imyourult/status/1184200732381237249?s=21)

Now, the discussion question I have is:

How do we curb the spread of misinformation in kpop and its effects on this sub moving forward? Im kinda shaken at how easily people took *BUZZFEEDS* words on how things work in the industry and ran with it. A lot of the claims made against SuperM in general have either been blown out of proportion or completely lied about. Im not trying to make this a SuperM only piece though, theyre just the most recent situation thats happened. These sorts of misinformation-that-then-goes-viral problems happen quite frequently on this sub (Ex: Another recent one was AllKpop spreading misinformation and twisting the story about whats currently happening to Choiza) and I would love to hear some ideas on how to potentially fix the mess thats been made. Should we require people to reupload their post with corrected info? Should we actually ban some websites that are known for clickbait (Ex: Allkpop, Buzzfeed, etc.)? 


What we have obviously isnt working, so let me know so that we can fully discuss this problem!",2,0,False,self,,,,,

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

However, the problem I have is related to the Chinese idols that came out in support for China in regards to the Hong Kong protests. I know that a public show of support was probably necessary to keep the chance of a career in China strong, and people from the country are most likely going to support it regardless, but as more news comes from it, I really can't support anyone on China's side. I feel like I'm being ridiculous, because now I can't listen to a lot of artists or their groups and I'm lowkey weary of every Chinese idol in the industry, but I also feel like continuing to listen to them would be like supporting China.

Each one sounds unique to me and the members themselves are very likeable. Im very hopeful for the upcoming generation because I feel like each group is carving their own path and unique sound and vibe. For me (and this is just my opinion), older K-pop (mostly 2nd gen) sounded very similar to me and it was hard for me to see one group as unique or bringing something new to the table.

I've became a big TWICE stan this year and 'Feel Special' was my first TWICE comeback that I can say I've experienced as a true Once. 

I've got so worried over Mina's state but was extremely happy she was going to be a part of the comeback and was also relieved that she wasn't going to be promoting in order to take care of herself more. 

And just yesterday they had their Japanese comeback (which is amazing btw) and then hours later I saw reports that JYPE is thinking about another korean comeback/repackaging still for 2019.

And that's where I want to get; initially my reaction was ""Oh my God, that's incredible! I can't get enough of TWICE! Yes, please!"" 

But after a few minutes I thought to myself ""Wait a minute... another one? Already? With 2 months left to go in 2019? These girls need some rest, they can't keep pushing them like this."" 

And Feel Special (the song and the album) felt so personal and something that they really wanted to do that this doesn't feel right to me anymore. 

That was the most recent moment I felt of myself holding back a little on my fandom because in my opinion they did everything they could for us this year, let them rest. 

What are some moments you guys had this type of ""evaluation"" of your fandom? With which groups? To me this is something really interesting.",39,31,False,self,,,,,

 Will they have any mental problems that don't make them see the harm they are doing? And I do not question their mental state to insult them but I am concerned about the little (or no) empathy they have and the illogical way in which they ignore or deny (proven) facts that discredit what they believe.

I'm hoping to buy tickets for Seventeen's Ode to You North American Tour in January, so I want to finally buy my first kpop lightstick! Unfortunately, this lightstick has been near impossible to find. At least as of right now, I've given up on most kpop sites like ChoiceMusicLA, KTown4u, Withdrama, KpopTown etc. because it is out of stock on all major sites. I've been looking on Ebay and unfortunately only version 1 is being sold, or overpriced options for version 2.

Basically, I'm asking if anyone can either let me know when/if they see this come back in stock on any of the sites I listed (especially ebay, since new listings pop up and sell out quickly) **OR**, do you guys think I should wait until the concert date as a gamble and hope that they are selling this lightstick (and enough of it) at a good price there?",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I guess the Korean people themselves wont stand it. I feel people who are not from Korea or dont know how to speak Korean shouldnt force themselves because non-Koreans get in a lot of scandals. Im not saying diversity is bad but they will get a lot of backlash and it will be a mess.

I'm more curious for English songs (without an original choreo) but other kpop songs work too. For me it's : 

AB6IX Woojin &gt;&gt;&gt; Red Velvet's Dumb Dumb
His energy would match the beat so well. I also saw Seventeen Woozi cover it. (briefly) They're both board chested so I thought of Woojin immediately.

AB6IX Woong &gt;&gt;&gt; Sam Smith's Lay Me Down
He's already uploaded this just give us the full

BTS Park Jimin &gt;&gt;&gt; Lorde's Sober
Sober is rather like Lie. It's within his contemporary skills but will prove challenging and darker.

(G)I-DLE Seo Soojin &gt;&gt;&gt; Hyuna's Babe
They both have similar dancing styles. Babe isn't really a sexy song so it would be interesting to see Soojin do something out of her realm but something within.

(G)I-DLE Song Yuqi &gt;&gt;&gt; Alec Benjamin's Let Me Down Slowly
Among Soojin's sexiness and Soyeon's fierceness, Yuqi balances them out. She's also usually really cute but this is a sad song. She delivered well for Say No so this should still be within her abilities.

Seventeen's Hoshi &gt;&gt;&gt; Lady Gaga's G.U.Y
He's already choreographed a sexual song like his solo, Touch, with feminine inspiration. G.U.Y is a song sung in a women's view but dominant and Hoshi is definitely known for his strong dances.

She knows I love kpop so I asked her if maybe I could show her some. Since I've been really into Ateez lately I started there. Showed her all MV and some relay dances and interviews. It was fun seeing her getting to know them more. At first she had trubble recognizing each member in every video since they switch hair color etc, you know the deal. But she always said ""I like that one"" to the same guy and that was Wooyoung. So she said ""oh theres my guy"" haha. So cute. She also liked Mingis voice since she could recognize it easy. We also watched a interview where they were asked something like ""what's your superpower"", and Jongho said ""lip balm"" which had my mom wheezing and cheering because she ALWAYS carry lip balm with her. It's like really a thing my mom can't live without. That was wholesome.

Then we watched some BTS and she really liked them. At first Jimin caught her attention, I mean when does he not  But she settled for Jin at the end. She loved Fake Love and Blood Sweat and Tears.

After showing her some modern and some what mainstream songs, I took her down the ""this is weird but we stan"" road. We watched Shinees Lucifer, EXO Growl, Doom Dada etc. That was fun and she actually liked many of the songs which was fun!

Blackpink was her favorite girl group of the ones I showed her. Me myself is not that into girl groups so we mostly watched boys.

This morning she said ""wow time really flew last night and suddenly it was 1 AM!"". And mom, that's the most ""I'm into kpop"" sentence I've ever heard  It was a really good time and I'm happy she enjoyed it!",2,9,False,self,,,,,

A place to talk about new and/or underrated Kpop groups/soloists/bands and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dhet0a/nugu_roundup_15_hey_girls_ahah_you_ready_oh_yeah/).

I initially had a different group slated for this week, but I'm planning on doing something special next week that I'd like to have them be a part of, so as a last-minute substitution, let's get to know S.I.S.!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**S.I.S.**

**Who are they?:**  A 4/5 member girl group (one member currently on hiatus, formerly a six member group with one member having departed) under XX Entertainment.  

**Company:** XX Entertainment currently shows that they have two promoted artists, the group S.I.S. and a soloist name Nayul.  It appears they may have previously or may still have another soloist known as Kinie K, and a female duo known as 12Dal (both seem active, so it's possible their website is just outdated).

**Members:**

* Minzy
   * Position: Main Dancer, Main Rapper, Vocalist, Interim Leader
   * Real Name: Choi Min-Ji
   * Age: 22 (IA)
   * [Self Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HJlzTBfVdc)

   * Age: 21 (IA)
   * [Self Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1uFKfzY30Y)
   * Facts: Her fellow members say she has the prettiest voice in the group, and that she's the best cook.  If she weren't an idol she'd want to be a pro gamer.  
* Anne
   * Position: Lead Dancer, Vocalist
   * Real Name: Kim Seungyeon
   * Age: 19 (IA)
   * [Self Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlozDFYEykY)
   * Facts: Won a national belly dancing competition, can imitate a rooster, does a lot of aegyo on stage but isn't like that off-stage, would want to be a PE teacher if she wasn't an idol

   * Real Name: Lee Sebin
   * Age: 18 (IA)
   * [Self Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMpT_mRYrTg)

   * Age: 23 (IA)
   * [Self Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH2OcRXu0Js)
   * Facts: Had a solo debut in February, can compose music and write lyrics, would have wanted to be a painter if she wasn't an idol

**Debut:** August 24th, 2017 with I've Got a Feeling ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gurmHg06jHI)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vEgsoi_Ds)) A mid-tempo song solidly in the cute/innocent realm with a GFriend meets OST aesthetic to the MV.

**Most Recent Comeback:** March 6th, 2019 with Always Be Your Girl ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B54wPt-vbF0)) Live Stage  ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSu2NBw_d_o)) Continuing with the innocent theme, the GFriend aesthetic, and a sound that's reminiscent of GFriend meets Lovelyz.

**Other MVs and Live Stages:**

* Say Yes ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUABnraw9Ds)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xuv8ryW0Dk4)) A bit more cute with a youthful elegance as compared to their more ethereal innocent vibe on their other title tracks, and I appreciate some actual saturation in the MV compared to the hazy white filter applied to their other title track videos.

**YouTube Channel:** [S.I.S. Official](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD472MQkXYn_fE8r8O3Xt_w/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=0) and [XX Entertainment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmQpfv8zIcDYm8L0_w6pBg/videos)

**Trivia:** S.I.S. stands for Serendipity in Stars.  Three of the members: Gaeul, Anne, and Sebin participated in The Unit.  The company has stated that the group will be promoting as four for the time being, but that Dal has not officially left the group and is on hiatus for personal reasons.  Anne was a backup dancer in the UNB Black Heart MV.

**Kolavo**

**Who Are They:** A five member co-ed KRock Band

**Genre:** Office Rock

**MVs and Live Performances:**

* Wolibal ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYoNzOVs0Sk)) 
* Salary Man ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG0mVxCJC9o)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iHAQQABJz8))
* Just Follow Me ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7GQ78zNO-o)) 

**YouTube:** [via PIG Entertainment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcMIylVqsvERrG8eksISGjA/videos)

**Thoughts:** As gimmicky as their concept is, I have to say I dig the music.  Salary Man takes me back to my Reel Big Fish and Sublime loving days, Just Follow Me has a great retro doo-wop feel, and even though you can taste the low budget in their Wolibal debut, it's still fun.  Their name, Kolavo, is apparently a transliteration of the Hangul which means 'Collaboration' which makes it a bit difficult to Google them.

* Wassup ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cz_rKhU2vM)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APL2gV6TKvE)) I'll let part of the official YouTube description blurb speak for itself "" They practiced much time on Twerking and put it into choreography. It will be one of the greatest points to watch twerking in the MV. ""  It is a bop though.

* Nom Nom Nom ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvpdSyZcAo)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o1jhXzX2fg)) Video has some cool jumprope choreo, and while there is the required Bulls merch, they at mix it up with a bunch of NFL jerseys as well.  The live stage has see-saw acrobatics.
* Shut Up U ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i0pyT6Jk9A)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6p-ToKyqoo)) A Halloween-inspired opening that has nothing to do with the video for an MV release in December?  Why not? 
* Stupid Liar ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edk0WvY6_yk)) I'm not sure what happened to their budget for this one, but the song is a groovy dark R&amp;B/Hip-Hop mix.
* La Pam Pam Pa ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCXzgzh4kcY)) I'm not sure why sexy hip-hop Christmas songs aren't more of a thing

**Active Between:** Augst 7th, 2013 - February 10th, 2019

**Reason for disbandment:** After Main Rapper Nada appeared on Unpretty Rapstar there was a dispute with Mafia Records over the money she earned from the show (the company taking it and applying it to pre-debut debt whereas she felt she should keep it) leading to a lawsuit between her and the company and her ultimately leaving the group along with fellow members Jinju and Dain.  The remaining four participated in one more comeback and then went silent until their contracts expired and the group was disbanded.

**Trivia:** Nada is now a solo hip-hop artist, and has appeared in MVs for B1A4 and Hyuna.  Member Dain participated in Mixnine.  Members Jiae and Nari took part in The Unit.

**\*\*\* SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT \*\*\***

I have something potentially special planned for next week, depending on how much content I can find.  On a tangentially related note (at least relating to content) I'd love to hear recommendations on nugu Boy Groups to feature in the future.  I just don't follow boy groups enough to know what's going on, so for any boy group fans, fill me in, thanks!  These are the boy groups who have previously been featured:

* Vromance
* OneWe
* OnlyOneOf
* Vanner
* D1CE
* Halo
* We In The Zone
* Be.A
* A.C.E.
* TRCNG
* Great Guys
* Forestella
* Dongkiz
* Argon
* N.Cus

Most of them have been the short blurbs, so if there's a nugu boy group with a lot of content, I'd like to find one to do a headline spot in the coming weeks, thanks!",33,45,False,self,,,,,

In  July 2019, member JSun decided to leave the group after the expiration  of her contract while member Dal is currently on hiatus due to ""personal  reasons"". The group is currently going to promote as 4 members.

They held two previous Makestar for their two most recent comebacks, which  [were](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sis_02)[ very successful](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sis/) \- making 312% and 224.32% above the initial asking price, respectively.

The group was active from 1993 to 1997, when they   disbanded after the release of their third album *Neo Myth of EOS*.   After the group disbanded, Hyung Joong sort of disappeared from the   industry, making the occasional guest feature on various tracks until  the reception of Good Person on Toys 2001 project album convinced him  to officially come back and debut as a solo artist. He officially  debuted as a solo artist in 2003.

After a [successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_eos/)   for their 25th Anniversary album (where they raised 186.13% above  their  goal), it seems that the group has decided to continue promoting  as an active group.

Although  the other two original members Go Sukyoung and Kangrin are not  involved, they have been replaced by Bae YoungJoon (on base) and Cho  Samhee (guitar). Their credits include being a former member of 90s  group Kona (Bae Youngjoon)  and being bandmaster for Epik High (Cho  Samhee).

As for Jeongmin, after Boyfriend disbanded, he eventually debuted as a soloist on June 19, 2019 with the song ""[   (Twenty One, Me and You)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip6_es5vYvM)"" and the accompanying single album *Small But Certain Happiness (Nearby)*.

* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

What is *Welcome to the Witchshop*?

*Welcome to the Witchshop* is an upcoming webdrama made in collaboration with Makestar and Bamboo Network and starring a number of idols.

The Makestar provides the following synopsis for the show:

&gt;A  witch shop that can only be seen by people who have a desire for hope.  Hyeji becomes a official part-timer of the shop. The witch does an  extraordinary job reviving the shop since as before she began working  there, there weren't any clients for a long time. The witch transforms  into a high school girl, Yeongji, and is transferred to Hyeji's class.  Who will come to the witch shop this time?

The cast includes:

* Yeo One (Pentagon) - as Seongwoo
* Lee Hyunjoo (former member of April and UNI.T) - as Yeongji
* Jung Hyojun (Produce 101 Season 2 #67) - as Yuho
* Chang Hyewon - as Hyeji

There's nothing on the Makestar page that notes when the drama is slated to  air, but I'm guessing it's in November given the project ends in  October.

*Welcome to the Witchshop* is an upcoming webdrama made in collaboration with Makestar and Bamboo Network and starring a number of idols.

The Makestar provides the following synopsis for the show:

&gt;A   witch shop that can only be seen by people who have a desire for hope.   Hyeji becomes a official part-timer of the shop. The witch does an   extraordinary job reviving the shop since as before she began working   there, there weren't any clients for a long time. The witch transforms   into a high school girl, Yeongji, and is transferred to Hyeji's class.   Who will come to the witch shop this time?

The cast includes:

* Yeo One (Pentagon) - as Seongwoo
* Lee Hyunjoo (former member of April and UNI.T) - as Yeongji
* Jung Hyojun (Produce 101 Season 2 #67) - as Yuho
* Chang Hyewon - as Hyeji

There's  nothing on the Makestar page that notes when the drama is slated to   air, but I'm guessing it's in November given the project ends in   October.

Who is Paradise?

Paradise is a four member male group signed to HL Company.

The group markets themselves as the ""first popera (pop+opera) idol group"".

They  debuted in April 2017 with the song ""Paradise"". There was no MV (at  least not one I could find), but you can watch their live performance of  the song (taken a few month after their debut) [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqr_A0izpjU)

Their most recent comeback was in December 2017 with the song ""[Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbm-IH-OjU4)"".

After a bit of a promo hiatus (they did a mini concert in 2018 but not much else), they began appearing on the first season of *Vocal Play.*

Some of their notable performances include:

* Their performance of ""[Lascia Ch'io Pianga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdw68Pf0U1A)""
* Their collab performance with Bae Dahae of ""[Let It Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH50K0WkSC4)"" (Frozen)
* Their collab performance with HISS of [a mashup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcxMTl_iN74) of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" and NEXT's ""Lazenca, Save Us""
* Their performance with H-Has and Yang Dongeun of ""[We Wish You a Merry Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyR3iN5xqws)""

Their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmVwmPItmfsfOdi3WBRCbWw/videos) gets updated pretty frequently, so check them out!

* Date Project Ends: November 7, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Haheun5?

Maheun5  is a project band done in collaboration with Makestar. The members are  all comedians, and all turning 40 in 2020, and see this group as a new    challenge for them.

So some interesting tidbits about the members:

* Wonhyo debuted as a soloist in July 2018 with the song ""[Awake or Asleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kU5-kgvOHY)"".
* Jiho has a personal [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChOGyN2SYQNKc6wPjFc-gdQ)
* SungKwang    was a member of idol group Brave Guys, which originally was intended   as  a gag skit parody during the 2012 KBS Gag Concert. But they became    popular with the GP so they actually released music together before    disbanding later that year. Their popular songs include ""[I Don't Care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teSWyg5mmOU)"" and ""[Farther Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNKx5hzjafk)"", of which were included in their only album *A to Z.*
* Kyunghwan debuted as a soloist in 2014 with the song ""[ing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSrSK443270)"" and has continued to release music on and off since.

[**BUSTERS Repackage Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_busters_01)

* Date Project Ends: November 12, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Busters?

Busters  is a five member girl group signed to Marbling E&amp;M (previously  Monstergram) and co-managed by JTG Entertainment (Berry Good's label).

According to our Nugu Roundup expert tutetibiimperes, the group was initially created to promote an anime called *Idol Ranger Power Busters.*

One of the group's defining ""traits"" is that the members were all former actresses (most being child actresses).

Some popular programs the members appeared on include:

* A-Teen (Minji)
* Hyeongseo (Tok!Tok! Boni, Hani)
* Scholar who Walks in the Night (Jisoo)
* The Queen's Classroom (Chaeyeon)
* Visible Flower (Yeseo)

The group debuted on November 26, 2017 with the song ""[Dream On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIkctIzFI5M)"".  Original member Minjung left the group in January 2019, and was  replaced by Yeseo. Yeseo's first comeback with the group was ""[Pinky Promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXOS0lWMEGw)"", which is also the group's most recent comeback.

This project for a repackage of this album.

Also, for you gamers out there, Hyeongseo provides the singing voice for Marvel character Luna Snow!

Luna is a K-Pop star by day, super hero by night (she has ice powers). She was originally introduced *Marvel Future Fight* (a game published by SK company Netmarble) and has been recently incorporated into the 616 Marvel universe via the *Agents of Atlas* comic book series.

As Luna, Hyeongso has released two songs, ""[I Really Wanna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TafbAlDS1a4)"" (feat. Krysta Youngs) and ""[Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlODbN4HH0U)"".",5,20,False,self,,,,,

I hope this is the last. I hope they mind their life more than the people's opinion. I hope idols or celebs can be stronger and they help each other in the industry. If korea is really harsh, please just move to another country. Please, i wish them to be happy and loved. Not by money, or fans gift, or news exposure. But real human love.

Say youre an exec at a major label and the your favorite group is about to be signed, but at the last minute you decide to split them into separate, smaller groups for optimum chances of success. 

For me itd beTWICE-

Group 1- Jihyo, Dahyun, Chaeyoung
Strong rnb/pop vocals from Jihyo and rap verses/bridges from the groups two rappers. 

Group 2- Nayeon, Mina, Momo
Momo is the strongest dancer, Nayeon one of the better vocalists and Mina is somewhere in between. Theyd be the most adult sounding group, slower jam songs. 

Group 3- Jeongyeon, Sana, Tzuyu
Synth pop, bubblegum/dance leaning, closest to TWICEs current sound. This group, I consider to be the most modelesque of the nine, and they would be all about serving looks/moods",35,22,False,self,,,,,

3130,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-10-21,2019,10,21,20,dkz11w,self.kpop,Non Asians in kpop - where is the gatekeeping line drawn?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dkz11w/non_asians_in_kpop_where_is_the_gatekeeping_line/,unicorn6642,1571656695,"There seem to be unwritten guidelines on who is and who isn't allowed to be in the kpop industry, no one really knows what they are exactly, but somehow the entire fandom is able to look at a person and collectively know in their head if this person belongs or not. This is a highly controversial topic and I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post this discussion but I just find this topic really interesting and wanted to hear what everyone thinks.

&amp;#x200B;

First, let's eliminate arguments so we can get a basic idea to grasp to:

""Kpop is for Koreans only"" not true since we have many Chinese and Japanese idols.

""Then, kpop is for East Asians only"" also not true since we also have many Thai idols, and Thailand is in South East Asia.

And that's where we're at at this moment. I guess the next argument would be ""then kpop is for Asians only"" but is that really true? Would the kpop fandom really accept an Indian or an Iranian idol? They're Asians too, but something tells me that they wouldn't be accepted. And that thing is the fact that they simply don't have a shape around their eyes called monolids. But even then, is that the correct current argument?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take for example, Lana, the controversial Russian kpop idol who recently debuted. She has monolids, so if my above argument would've been correct, she should fit right in the kpop world, right? Well, not necessarily. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mjjm8bjsmvt31.jpg

Everyone calls her ""kpop's first caucasian idol"" but is that really fair? Lana isn't just a white girl from Moscow who ""looks Asian"", she's from Sakhalin, an island to the far far east of Russia. If you actually look at the world map, Sakhalin is closer to Japan, Korea and the rest of Russia than any other country, and throughout history it was claimed by both Japan and Russia. The population of Sakhalin is most definitely mixed race, if anything. Lana isn't trying to look Asian, she IS Asian. I feel like if Sakhalin was instead a part of Japan, no one would be talking. But because it's a part of Russia, everyone calls her a koreaboo white girl when in reality she probably has a big amount of East Asian genes. If other mixed race idols are accepted in kpop, what's the difference here? But that's just my personal opinion...

&amp;#x200B;

So we can't say that being Asian is what decides if you can be a kpop idol since not all Asians would be accepted, but we also can't say that having monolids is what decides if you can be a kpop idol, because as we can see with Lana that's not true either. So what exactly IS the gatekeeping factor here?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*Also let me add that I am NOT considering people like Oli London in any way relevant to this discussion. Using plastic surgery to try to ""change your race"" and pretend you're Asian when in reality you're white crosses every single line and shouldn't be an example of non Asians trying to make it in the kpop industry. People like him are a disgrace on the community and shouldn't have any merit on the question I proposed.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

You may remember [my post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6pu17b/the_influence_of_big_ice_cream_on_the_kpop/)  from 2 years ago that revealed the secret plot of the South Korean ice cream industry (hereafter referred to as Big Ice Cream) to use kpop to subconsciously sell their product. I had to lie low for a while lest Big Ice Creams agents hunt me down, but since 2017 Ive noticed continued mentions of ice cream in kpop girl group songs. You may be thinking, but u/vagabond2787, this sounds idiotic. Surely they often throw plenty of other random nonsensical English words into kpop songs, why is ice cream so special? If youve seen since 2017, the sexy concept is out, and girl crush is in: which is the perfect concept to drive the type of songs and images that one associates with ice cream. You dont hear other desserts or sweet products being mentioned nearly as much as ice cream. My thesis is that kpop entertainment agencies are secretly working with Big Ice Cream to increase the sales of ice cream by planting in consumers minds images of fun, youth, and sweetness.

But why would they want to do this? Certain businesses in South Korea are very reliant on how hip or in the trends currently are with the young crowd. According to [this report] (https://www.sigep.it/sigep/note-di-mercato/2019/ice-seoul_ice-cream-market-report---korea.pdf) from an Italian trade agency prepared for investors, ice cream is currently facing stiff competition from other trendy desserts such as coffee, bubble tea, and ice flakes. The rise of social media such as Instagram also favors hip cafes for the gram, meaning ice cream specialty shops are on the rise, and retail ice cream is on the decline. Clearly, Big Ice Cream is getting desperate. So thats the why, but wheres the evidence?

* [Rocket Punch  Bim Bam Bum] (https://youtu.be/0306kjwhO-8?t=124)

Were you excited about Rocket Punchs debut? I know I was. But I also knew that their assumed girl crush concept would give ample opportunity for Big Ice Cream to further their agenda. Sure enough, at the 2:05 mark, Juri Takahashi says Its like the taste of ice cream which makes sense because she was probably the most hyped member coming off a top 20 PD48 finish. She even says it again at 3:12. You might think theyre saying that love feels like ice cream, without further explanation as to how  but really it was shoved into the song due to pressure from Big Ice Cream. 

* [Fanatics-Flavor - Milkshake] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSIx8K_NMsk)

Ok they dont actually say ice cream in this song, but a milkshake is pretty much ice cream and milk. This [isnt even the first song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e2hR5zuGtA) to be named Milkshake, but it is the most recent. Another PD48 alum, Kim Doah is the center of this subunit and the main group. Is that significant? Well to answer that question we have to go to the Produce series itself..

* [Produce 48  I Am] (https://youtu.be/CPo2Qd4chx4?t=38)

This was one of the songs written specifically for Produce 48, before then the girls did all covers of previously released songs. Judging by the members chosen for this group and their outfits, this was clearly supposed to be a sexier/sultry concept, where you wouldnt expect ice cream to show up. But sure enough Kauen says ice cream barely 38 seconds in. This group had 2 eventual Iz*One finalists, Yujin and Yena, as well as Juri again. It also had the Kirin twins Kaeun and Yunjin from Pledis, and we all know their [strong market ties] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmjDyCF87dE) to Big Ice Cream. Weve heard about Mnets evil editing and shady vote manipulation allegations, well now I think they are secretly in cahoots with Big Ice Cream too. 

* [Red Velvet  Umpah Umpah] (https://youtu.be/vHS9E6JFja8?t=99)

Ah yes, SM  the biggest kpop entertainment agency. Now that Girls Generation is on semi-hiatus, Red Velvet is their main girl group act. And that means ample opportunity for Big Ice Cream to influence the minds of the young generation. At 1:39, Joy mentions Ice Cream Cake. Now you might think this is a clever call-back to their previous hit singles, but really its because RV havent mentioned ice cream in a while and SM was probably getting pressured by Big Ice Cream to bring it up again.

* [BlackPink  Ice Cream Event Day] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsyInQXEIs4)

Yes, this wasnt an actual song but its uploaded to their official YouTube channel, so I think it counts. Ask any kpop fan who the top girl group is, and you might hear BlackPink (if theyre an international fan). Im not sure who provided this ice cream, but the girls sure do mention it a lot, and this video is pretty much them marketing the product. Never before have kpop and Big Ice Cream worked so closely and unabashedly together.

* [Twice  Fancy] (https://youtu.be/kOHB85vDuow?t=47)

At the time of my first post, Twice was already breaking records, and now they are firmly at the top of the girl group world. However, their sound has remained largely unchanged so here again we have ice cream used as a simile. Sana is the one that mentions ice cream, which I guess shouldnt surprise me as she is the most memeable member. I also shouldnt be surprised that Big Ice Cream has continued their partnership with the biggest girl group out there and JYP, which seems to still be a top and growing agency. 

So there you have it, the Big 3 are all in the pockets of Big Ice Cream. If thats not evidence enough, then I dont know what is. Last time I feel like the evidence was a lot more obvious and in your face. But now Big Ice Cream is cleverer. They know kpop fans dont appreciate product placement, so they are a lot more subtle these days. Ill be honest; its been hard for even me,  who has no life really, to keep up with all the girl group debuts and comebacks lately. And perhaps thats what Big Ice Cream is hoping for  that we wont notice this plot among the countless new songs, and continue to subconsciously buy more ice cream. I say we because in the time since my first post, I came to realize that this conspiracy goes far beyond just the country of South Korea. Kpop is now a worldwide phenomenon: kpop acts hold concerts all over the world, kpop music and merchandise is sold all over the place, and perhaps most damning, kpop entertainment companies recruit foreign producers *to make music that will appeal most to all listeners*. [According to Statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/40100400/100/ice-cream/worldwide), worldwide revenue of Ice Cream is growing steadily, and I think kpop has helped. But is this all nefarious? Youll have to decide that for yourself

But what songs did I miss? Let me know below, and well expose this plot together!",124,553,False,self,,,,,

I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back on thursday night for update! I will be off next week due to relocation.

I need your help!

I'm writing my undergraduate dissertation on the BTS phenomenon because I was truly fascinated on how they become so successful in a world where we don't usually accept other forms of music that isn't English.

To get some data for my research I made a survey which will take 15 - 30 minutes. A lot of this is based on fans and how they could have driven BTS to success.

I would appreciate it if you have any time to fill it out or send it to others who listen to BTS/ ARMYs!

Thank you

""Oh no... not that song..."" like not necessarily because it's a bad song but because it would be a bad introduction to the group and turn people who might have otherwise liked the group away from listening to more of their music?

For me, whenever I see someone who's new to k-pop, a LOT of the time they get recommended *""I Got A Boy""* and I'm like-- NO--- STOP!! I love Girls' Generation but that song has wayyy too much going on for a new listener and can turn them off entirely. I've seen too many people get recommended that song and then go ""oh god what is going on I don't think SNSD/kpop is for me."" And I see too many people recommending *""Gee""* to Western music fans-- while *Gee* is a classic, it's just way too cutesy for most new coming Western fans and turns a lot of them completely off. I wish people would recommend ""You Think"" more often, it's a banger and is a really safe rec for people who like Western music. ""Mr Mr"" and ""Run Devil Run"" are also pretty safe bets.

That's the most egregious example I can think of, but I'm sure this applies to other groups as well! Thoughts?",66,57,False,self,,,,,

Are there any idols that you don't follow, doesn't really know (or even care to know) about, but whenever you see them at award shows and such events you automatically feel good about them? People who give others a good impression or have a lot of charisma and you can't help but be ""you're nice, keep going"". I'm like this with Yugyeom. Don't follow got7 and am even less familiar with him as an individual  but whenever I see anything he's on I can't help smiling and cheering for him. He was Jungkook's first idol friend and seems like a lovely and sweet person. Plus he's handsome and performs well. And though I don't follow gilrgroups I always had huge respect for Jihyo. She seems well like by everyone and keeps a great image of being someone nice, elegant and with good work ethic. Daniel is the same way (but I did watch p101) so they are a true royal couple in my eyes. What about you? Take this as a chance to say kind things about idols :)",135,109,False,self,,,,,

Let's start with what propelled her to where she is today - her music. Her voice is ethereal. It's not the most powerful but boy is it good to listen to. Why do Koreans love her music so much? Koreans love their soulful ballads and coffee shop music, but I believe it's also because of her deep and meaningful lyrics which she writes herself. Through the Night and Knees speak of her insomnia, while Dear Name tells of the pain of losing a loved one.

I think another key to her success is that her music is the bridge between the younger and older generations. By remaking classics of old Korean songs, she retains the beauty of the original while having her younger fans appreicate older music. Young or old, IU is for everybody.

Her acting hasn't always received great recognition but it really took a turn during My Mister. What an exemplary performance from IU! It was all the more surprising as it was nothing at all like her previous roles. A truly genius casting by director Kim Won-seok. IU has proved her versatility as an actress through Persona and Hotel Del Luna since. Her acting in scenes when she is supposed to be angry was superb in Hotel Del Luna, particularly with her expressions with her eyes, was on another level. Of course, she also excelled when it came to cute and funny scenes and her voice of Jang Man-wol was great, which is so different to the IU we know and love.

IU is also extremely beautiful, you will be hard pressed to find a more beautiful actress in a kdrama than her during Hotel Del Luna. All the numerous dresses as well as hairstyles and make-up was something to behold. I mean, we're taking an exceptionally gorgeous woman and making her even more stunning. I didn't think it was possible but it was.

Her beauty on the inside is perhaps what sets her apart the most. She truly has a heart of gold. She has donated so much to charity, particularly to charities to help disadvantaged children. Despite all her success, she still remains humble and looks after her family, even buying her father a car as a present. And last year when she renewed her contract with Kakao M, what was her terms and conditions? To ensure the job security of her staff and to increase their wages. I mean who the hell does that? Her IU team have been with her since the start and to her, they are are like family. In fact, many of her closest celebrity friends she has known since almost the time she debuted. 

IU is truly a breath of fresh air in this polluted world.  Feeling sad and want to cry? Listen to IU. Feeling happy? Listen to IU. What a good role model and someone to look up to? Stan IU.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

1. [K- Fright Night at Henke &amp; Pillot - Downtown Houston](https://www.facebook.com/events/395352814685043). This one will be open to those who are 18+ and want to dance the night away in their scariest costumes. The cover is $10 after 9:30pm. I may throw in some popular hip-hop and pop music from the states here.

2. [Halloween Havoc at Barbarella Houston](https://www.facebook.com/events/1297163087121940/). This one will ONLY be 21+. When I started DJ'ing a year ago, I put on my first K-POP Night at this venue and the outpouring love and support has been phenomenal since then.

I stopped keeping track of their comebacks in around 2017 because their title tracks weren't interesting to me. However I am aware that they've switched up their sound and have become more self-produced and I've heard bits and pieces of some of their recent songs like Eclipse which have been received really well. I know that as soon as I do take the time to listen to their newer albums I'll probably end up loving them, but I just haven't done it yet. Personally, I feel like it's because I already know the members and a lot of their older content, the process is different from when I get into a completely new group with zero knowledge. Also, because I do know I'll end up loving their songs, I'm avoiding listening to them because I feel so busy even keeping up with the current artists I like because of how fast-moving the kpop industry is.

I found it to be interesting, but curious what y'all think.  

Here are the top 20: 

1. BTS
2. Twice
3. Oh My Girl
4. Mamamoo
5. Red Velvet
6. Black Pink
7. Lovelyz
8. Girls' Generation
9. IZ\*ONE
10. EXO
11. (G)I-DLE
12. AOA 
13. Seventeen
14. Cosmic Girls
15. Apink
16. Everglow 
17. ITZY
18. Super Junior
19. SHINee
20. Weki Meki

Have you heard of this last band? It's the first time I've heard of them, but I'm outside of Korea and haven't been paying as much attention to all the lesser knowns.  

Others like Ateez (99), Got7 (61), &amp; Monsta X (52) were further down the list than I expected.  And I definitely didn't recognize MANY of them past #20.  If there's enough interest, I can put the rest here.  

The survey using translate explains the methodology as the following: 

As a result of analyzing big data in September 2019, the idol group's top 100 brands were ranked in the order of No.1 BTS No. 2 and TWICE No. 3 O My Girl.    The Korea Corporate Reputation Research Institute extracted 142,702,697 100 idol group brand big data from August 26, 2019 to September 27, 2019 to analyze idol group brand reputation big data. The brand reputation index was analyzed by index, media index, communication index, and community index. Compared to 169,420,140 idol group 100 big brands in August 2019, it increased by 15.77%.    The Brand Reputation Index is an index created through brand big data analysis that finds that online habits of consumers have a big impact on brand consumption. By analyzing the idol group's 100 brand reputations, it is possible to measure the affirmation of the idol group's 100 brands, media interests, consumers' interests and traffic. The ratings of 100 brand reputation editors were also included.

So, I wanted to ask one thing...

Who be the six artists for FEMALE ROTY at MAMA this year?*

*Keep in mind MAMA allows both groups and soloists for ROTY so that makes it interesting...

Id say ITZY is the only LOCK with maybe Everglow close behind but Im a LOT less certain with them...

So its: ITZY, Everglow?, ???, ???, ???, ???

Id LOVE to see DreamNote be this years nature and sneak in but I know Im delusional. Maybe Somi gets in with her Mnet connections? They do allow soloists debuting from groups compete for ROTY so...

There were so many groups this year but its hard to give anyone an edge Id say beyond ITZY and maybe Everglow...

Lets go with 7 members total.
What 7 girl idols put into the same group are most likely to take over the industry, or break the world.

-Jihyo: Leader, Lead Vocalist, Lead Dancer
-Rose: Main Vocalist
-Sana: Sub Vocalist, Visual
-Lisa: Main Dancer, Lead Rapper
-Seulgi: Main Dancer, Sub Vocalist
-Soyeon: Main Rapper
-Yuqi: Sub Vocalist, Maknae

For me, this group can pull off any look, style, music, concept, etc.
Most members are already insanely popular. They all bring their unique attributes to the group, and overall mash well together imo.

Talent, personality, work ethic, experience, english, every member is just powerful

Ps the roles i gave are just to give an idea, although i think it looks okay",2,2,False,self,,,,,

In almost all of them with a couple of exceptions, pictures and video have been forbidden. I have seen many people get kicked out and I, myself have been asked to stop taking photos with my phone and have even had my phone taken once.

That being said, super high-quality fansite photos and videos from all of these shows pop up the next day.

This past weekend at the Twice ONCE Halloween 2 fanmeet, I was sitting right next to someone with an expensive DSLR camera. He was kicked out within the first 20 minutes, came back later and was kicked out again never to return. I was also yelled at for using my phone and as were others.

However on the front row, there was a known Tzuyu fansite person with their high quality DSLR camera snapping away the entire show. No one ever talked to him and staff seemed to pretend he didn't exist.

I'm not well versed on fansite culture so I was wondering how exactly does it work. Do fansites work out deals with companies that give them exclusive access to photos at all events? What differentiates someone from being approved and not approved? The photos the guy next to me were taking were very high quality and great looking, but he got kicked out. Are the fansites paying money for this privilege? 

Just something I've always wondered about.",10,14,False,self,,,,,

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

For example - I had this idea for last year where you could essentially tell a love story from beginning to end with Pentagon performing Shine (the confession), then Winner performing Everyday (dating), then iKON joined by the others performing Love Scenario (the breakup).

I always read that certain idols (generally from big companies) have a really well off family, parents that are CEOs of big companies, doctors, chefs, etc. Even rumours that some of them came from chaebol families.

And that made me think, these idols had an advantage over the other trainees before debut? 

Are there more wealthy trainees/idols than lower or middle class ones because the selection process benefits those who are affluent? (at least in big or medium companies) The wealthy ones have more opportunities to debut than the average?",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Twice recently had an amazing comeback, jopping exploded in a way the boys reached Ellen, Queendom just served us a whole ALBUM with a song from each group, and... it just feels like a safe haven to me at this point.

I am a 17 year old guy from America (straight sexuality if that matters). I listen to Kpop (mainly TWICE, LOONA, RV, IZ*ONE, BOL4). I usually dont get too worked up on people judging me for the things I do. I play video games, make YouTube videos, and other things with bad stereotypes, but nothing makes me more self conscious than being a Kpop fan. Id love to have Momo from Twice as my phone background, so, you know, I can see a beautiful girl every time I look at my phone. Its like if anyone would have their girlfriend on their lock screen. Obviously she aint my girlfriend and thats not what im implying by making her my lock screen. I some reason cant find myself to do that, or when I did it for a week I always had my phone brightness all the way down so I wouldnt have to tell anyone who looked at my phone I listened to Kpop. Im REALLY open to my friends about the fact that I listen to Kpop. Im also studying Korean, and hope to travel there some day, partly correlating with finding Kpop but I really would like to learn many Asian languages and travel other places. My friends know all of this, but they kind of see it as a flaw in my personality sort of. One of my friends flat out tells people I listen to Kpop. People that I dont necessarily like. I get REALLY worked up about this. I dont wanna be assumed to be a die hard fan of Kpop that will do everything in their power to meet and try to date their stan, kill for their stan, and other crazy things like that. Im not like that. Im just someone that enjoys the aesthetic of the groups and music videos and the music itself as well. The language is beautiful IMO. I just wish that I could proudly show that im a Kpop fan. I just cant find the confidence to do so. My other friends make jokes that I watch the music videos too much or always assume Im listening to Kpop, even though I listen to other American artists all the time (Blackbear, Post Malone, KYLE, etc). They assume these things in school, and Im too afraid that theyre gonna say something out loud and people will hear. The point of this post was more or less a rant that I needed to get off my chest, and to see if there are other people like me. Thanks for listening even though I think Im starting to sound crazy myself after thinking about this for so long.",17,4,False,self,,,,,

I am thinking of buying another KPOP Album. So far I only have BLACKPINK's first mini-album Square Up. The KPOP artists I listen to are BLACKPINK, TWICE, DREAMCATCHER and MOMOLAND.

I was thinking either TWICE's new mini-album: Feel Special, which comes at about 25 (free delivery) on Amazon or BLACKPINK's 2nd mini-album: Kill This Love, which comes at about 29 (free delivery) on Amazon.

Please don't recommend the cheapest one or any other cheaper sites. I just want to know which one has better songs to listen to and which one has better addons (postcards, posters etc.)

Many thanks

We're a small fandom, and I know some people are gonna laugh at me for asking because it's ""sad"", but the boy's 100 days is coming up and we've been trying to hit 10million by then.

I really want to be able to do this for them because the boys all wanted ROTY as their goal and specifically said so, but didn't even get nominated. CIX stans are sad we can't do more for the boys, and want to give them a memorable debut year.

If you can and are willing please help us stream a bit &lt;3 I'll vote whoever for MAMA since we didn't get any noms at all. And if you haven't listened to CIX yet, please check them out! You won't be disappointed!

A place to talk about new and/or underrated Kpop groups/soloists/bands and share information, performance videos, etc.  [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/dkolub/nugu_roundup_16_agent_kolavo_sis_has_intercepted/).

This week I'm switching things up a bit.  Instead of the typical group focus I'm doing an MV/Special-Clip theme week for Halloween!  I'm playing a little bit loose with my 'Nugu' definition this week, instead of only highlighting groups that are from smaller companies without wins I'm going to expand it to include groups that are generally flying under the radar as well as soloists who may come from well-known and successful groups but whose solo activity isn't garnering a lot of attention.  I'm also mixing current and disbanded groups up this week, so enjoy!  

**I'm only including Halloween/Spooky/Horror themed videos from the groups listed this week, these aren't representative of their entire discography, there may be some repeats from previous weeks, and some these groups may pop up again in the future for a full feature.**

**I know that Dreamcatcher fits this theme perfectly, but I'm not including them this week because they're incredibly popular around here (I love them myself) and I'd like to focus on some other groups.**

There's a lot of stuff I didn't include for the sake of time and space, so please share your favorites below!

**Welcome to the Nugu Roundup Halloween Special!**  

**1NB**

**Status:** Disbanded

**MVs and Live Stages**

* Stalker ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IY1tmS9N64)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC_dLd9PYsM)) The long cinematic intro seems to be a lost art in Kpop this year, but 1NB brings a whole story along with this sultry dark jam.
* Where U At ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2I4YoPdT84)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyecV-86Ac0)) R&amp;B slow jams meet murder and cannibalism with one of the gorier scenes I can recall from any Kpop video
* Winter, Again ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fycAID1dKo))  The rare dark Christmas song, better check for those needle marks

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Dongkiz**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Blockbuster ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9GU37Rk-I)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxxnsrPjBSQ)) Sampling the Ghostbusters theme song and borrowing quite a bit of the aesthetic for a fun goofy Halloween take.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Sunny Hill**

**Status: Active**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Midnight Circus ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjBHPvYW3Gk)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFDz03aHXGE))  Are circuses inherently creepy?  I'd say yes, especially ghostly ones in the middle of the night.  Bonus points for Kota embracing her inner-Gain.  
* Pray ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uive4DMqAdc)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2jqj6FTuWE)) Dark, disturbing, and poignant all at the same time, the beautiful melody contrasts with an MV that's difficult to watch.

**History**

**Status: Disbanded**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Psycho ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDc5vYw_UE)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLPb7P8rizg))  This synth-driven bop was apparently inspired by Alfred Hitchcock and tells the story of obsessive love and split personalities

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**NS Yoon-G**

**Status: Semi-Active**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* The Reason I Became a Witch ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysnUHXksic8)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke1exinXMgk)) What's Halloween without sexy witches?  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Big Flo**

**Status: Indefinite Hiatus**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Obliviate ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEtpfu_ro6E)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYSMzO-xRIQ)) Bringing Block-B style swagger to a video featuring voodoo dolls and magic this one is a banger.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Lee Jung Hyun**

**Status: Active as an actress**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* V ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUfH53bYp1Q)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA8VrHDDKZo))  An adorkably cute and creepy electro-swing number with a nice cinematic intro.

**A6P**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Face Off ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGHaBRQeLc)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuyFuEcMO20))  An organ intro plus creepy masks puts this into the Halloweeny vibe

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**JeA**

**Status: Active**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Dear Rude ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INhFm3GNk54)) Live Performance ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc-z_JEY2_U)) I know JeA is anything but Nugu, she's a queen, and even plays one in this gory vampire/ghoul themed MV, but it's a criminal that her solo stuff never seems to get recognized.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A.Kor**

**Status: Disbanded**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* But Go ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcrSwNKEuJA)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQn36B2iqdA)) Torturing men seems to be a recurring theme in these videos.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Narsha**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

* Bbi Ri Bba Bba ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C52IdVUJ6OI)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQXxeQi2vpo)) Another non-Nugu but severely underrated as a soloist, this dance-pop piece blends a lot of horror tropes into a cool video.

**E.Via / Tymee**

**Status: Semi-Active**

**MVs and Live Stages:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*It was this short clip of a k pop girl group wearing edgy black dresses dancing and singing in a haunted mansion.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It wasn't a full length video, it was only a preview of the song and faded to black at the end.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*They also had the same preview on a Facebook page.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It reminded me of Britney Spears in the mid to late 2000's (2008-2012) and had that Britney spears Ke$ha feel to it; that generic super-saw club sound.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The video was sort of halloweeny.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I think it was in some way related to JYP Entertainment; might have been an older video on their YouTube channel, but I couldn't find it.*

Im not jealous of her friend or anything she has the right to have more friends. Im just upset that she wouldnt think to see if I wanted to go. She makes me invite her to literally anything I mention that sounds fun to her. I remember she threw a fit bc I didnt want to invite her to Christmas in houston with me.

If this is your first time hearing of GOT7? Hello! Ahgase (Baby Birds) Welcome you to start of your journey into the incredibly chaotic beauty that is GOT7. Maybe you have been interested in getting into them for a while but don't know where to start? This should help you with that.

# Introduction

**NAME:** GOT7 (  )

**Fandom:** Ahgase (Baby Birds)

**Debut:** January 16th 2014

**Members:** 7 (or nothing)

**Sub-Units:** JJ Project (JB and Jinyoung; debuted 2012) | JUS2 (JB and Yugyeom; debuted 2019)

**Known For:**

* [Their incredible friendship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3_CclFXIk0&amp;t)
* [Absolutely hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te9UX27eapU&amp;t)
* [Having No Shame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=134HUBV_HXU) 
* [Being Just Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrdk3IGcau8) 

The most important thing to know about GOT7 is they are not just best friends but true brothers and family. Above all else their relationship to each other is the most important thing. They fight like best friends, they are loyal like family. 7 or nothing is their motto. [They are the best when they are together.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-GPS2iD8XY) 

[They've even been asked by other idols why they hang out so much](https://youtu.be/Eyb4Fadr5PI?t=378) and [why do they do everything together](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw9LSWCAkab/). It's genuinely because they enjoy their time together more rather than when they are apart. 

*Its so good seeing them, its like wow. Ill spend time with them everyday, every single day of the whole year and I just forgot how good to have the members as my friends. At the airport I saw my members and I was like Oh my god, these are my people How do I forget about the feeling; how we laugh everyday, having someone to talk to or like having fun and joking around. I just realize how important that feeling is, that we have for each other. It kinda sounds weird that like 7 boys would have that kind of feeling to each other but its not that man its just a good thing -* [Bambam 2019](https://twitter.com/yugyeomstardust/status/1094260425212850177)

# Musical Style/Discography/Performance 

GOT7 debuted in 2014 as a rap/hip hop group but in 2017 they went through a style change after the end of the series titled *Flight Log; Departure, Turbulence and Arrival*.  People believe that GOT7 songs like *Just Right*, *If You Do* or the Flight Log series were a 'peak' because internationally those were heavily talked about but in reality their charting and sales were actually much lower compared to how high they are now. Many fans consider this split period in their music from when JYP and JYP house producers heavily worked on it from their debut in 2014 to the beginning of 2017.

The second half of 2017 marked a new beginning for GOT7 with 7 for 7 (*You Are*) and GOT7 getting control of their music style. Since then all b-sides have been written by them (untouched by the company) and their title tracks *You Are, Look* and *Eclipse* have all been written by their leader JB. Their music is ever changing and evolving but many fans consider them to have an R&amp;B sound overall now which has made them happier with their music and the growth they have achieved. GOT7 have posted many videos behind the scenes videos and clips regarding their writing and producing process. They work with their own personal producers and friends on tracks to submit them to JYP for final approval. 

**Still interested?** ***Let's get it.*** GOT7 have had a total of 10 mini albums (including their new one Call My Name), 3 full length albums and many Japanese releases. This will focus mainly on their title tracks and b-sides from debut to now:

# Variety Shows

GOT7 have had countless Variety Shows (22 and counting), not even including that with very single comeback they tend to have a behind the scenes show titled something different that follows it. 'Page 1, 2', #3Minutes, JJ Diary, JUS2 Moments, GOT7 on the Scene ect. But here we will just cover the fully filmed variety content series they have done that are free and easy to watch. I have bolded the three that are essential to watch if you really want to start learning about the members and the group overall;

**GOT7 Original Variety**

&gt;[Are you Ready?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeNQ-I7OCRQ)

I could go on forever with various variety, hilarious videos and content. They've been a group for almost 7 years and I know it's a massive amount of content to consume to which many people are busy or don't have the time to go through that much content. They are an ever growing group but I hope I have given just enough to peak the interest of even a casual listener or new fans. Even just showing a new side of GOT7 that you maybe didn't know.

If you find broken/wrong links, and/or spelling mistakes, please let me know! I will be happy to update this as well with links for their new comeback MV and variety content!

I hope everyone is looking forward to their comeback on November 4th with Call My Name!",27,310,False,self,,,,,

This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song per person a week. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. For time sake, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So no live, remix, or free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating
5. I translate on Thursday. So I would prefer last request be on Wednesday midnight.  = P

Besides those things though I think we can agree there is a lot of other shitty things that can happen in kpop. 1 was when Haechan broke his leg, its never fun when an idol breaks something and has to sit out for a hiatus and it always makes me feel so sad for the idol that it happened to. Another thing is car accidents even if everyone is fine I still feel my heart drop to my stomach especially because I was around for the Ladies Code incident so now whenever I see car accident news I get such bad anxiety. 

For news that I would hate to see is an idol going missing. Like one day a company announces ""X never showed up to his/her schedules and is not answering us or the other members, their family hasnt seen or heard from them and they werent at their house "" then it goes on for who knows how long. I dont even want to imagine about something as awful like that happening because of all the horrible things that could be the cause and I hope theres never a situation where that is the case especially for young teen idols who are only ages 13-17. Of course it would be bad for any idol of any age but it would be scary to think of a young rookie kid being kidnapped or something worse (although kidnapping is horrible in its own). 

Another would be someone getting raped. Like yeah sexual harassment and assault are horrible things but an idol coming forward saying they were straight up raped by a fan/boss/another idol/group mate would be terrible.

For me my number 1 song I wish had a MV is Cross Gene's Dystopia. Every song on the Zero album has an MV except for this masterpiece and I just desperately wish it had a proper MV. It was used in their comeback teaser but it was only 1 minute and just the instrumental. I'd probably be saying this even if the other B tracks didnt have MVs but the fact that they all do except Dystopia just adds insult to injury,133,53,False,self,,,,,

The most obvious one, which everyone seems to ignore, is the fact that each member in a singing group have specific positions. Take Twice for example. Jihyo is the main singer and Nayeon the lead singer. So, of course they get the most lines, but people ignore that and complain how theyre getting most of the lines. I would also like to remind you all that this is also observed on international groups such as One Direction. Line distributions will never be fair.

We are diving into award season and I wanted to know what are some predictions and opinions you guys might have.

As much as we all want our favourites/ult group/bias to win, we have to look at the criteria for each award shows to see who has a higher chance of winning (even though most of the times they don't really follow strictly on the criteria).

Since each award show is different, I'll break down the predictions by category and award show. I will only be discussing 3 categories. To me, BTS has Artist of the Year and Album of the Year on lockdown on most (if not all) of the award shows.

**1. Best New Male Artiste**

This is a very crowded category - there were so many stand-out male rookies this year it's insane. I would say the stand outs that would score nominations are X1, Tomorrow X Together (TXT), AB6IX, Kang Daniel, Ateez, Kim Jae Hwan. I will throw in CIX and ONEUS as wildcards.

MAMA's criteria is 30% voting + 30% judges + 20% record sales + 20% music sales. This one is pretty hard to call in my opinion. TXT is leading the online votes now but X1 and Kang Daniel has the upper hand with sales as they sold way more as compared to TXT. TXT about 300+K combined sales, X1 sold 600+k and Kang Daniel sold 500+K.

I think it boils down to the professional judges votes - I would predict either TXT or X1. TXT's musical and creative direction is very distinct and sets them apart from the other rookies so they might score points for that. X1 has made an impact on the industry with their sales figures and influence (i.e. selling out Gocheok, 11 wins on music shows, etc). Both groups had remarkable Billboard achievements as well. I would say it's neck and neck for MAMA. One would receive the rookie award, the other would have to settle for Best of Next.

For Melon Music Awards (MMA), the criteria is 60% digital + 20% judges + 20% voting. Looking at how the criteria is digital heavy, I would think X1 would have this in the bag because they are the best performing male rookie group in terms of digital points. X1 has about 240million combined digital points, that's almost 2.5 times more than the next highest rookie (Kim Jae Hwan at 104million combined digital points).

Unless if any other rookies score full points for judges and voting (which makes up 40%), I would say MMA would be X1's.

Similarly for Golden Disk Awards (GDA), where the criteria is 70% music sales and 30% expert, X1 would easily take the trophy based on their sales. If more than 1 rookie award is given out (GDA gives out more than 1 in previous years), TXT would stand a high chance too.

**2. Best New Female Artiste**

Based on all the criteria listed above for the male group, I expect Itzy to take clean sweep for the female rookie awards on all award shows as they are the best performing female rookie group in both physical sales and digital points.

If more than 1 rookie award is given out, the other potential awardee would be Everglow. I don't really think the other female rookies would stand a chance, not in the main rookie awards at least.

**3. Song of the Year**

This one is tricky. It depends whether or not they are only nominating idol songs or its open for all (including ballads, OST, etc). Here are some possible contenders based on digital performance:

Idol songs: BTS - Boy With Luv, Chung Ha - Gotta Go, N.Flying - Rooftop, Taeyeon - Four Seasons, ITZY - Dalla Dalla

Other songs M.C. The Max - After You've Gone, Kassy - The Day Was Beautiful

Wildcard: TWICE - Fancy (based on digital performance, they are not in the Top 20 but they might probably score a nomination if they have high judges score. To put into perspective the difference, Fancy has about 500million points as compared to Gotta Go which has more than 800million points.)

Just purely based on digital performance, Chung Ha would take home SOTY with Gotta Go. But if it's open for all, M.C. The Max would take it as it has the highest digital score so far this year at 847 million points (Chung Ha is at 814 million, not too far off).

I've read that a lot of people expect TWICE to take home SOTY at MAMA, which might be possible since 40% is based on judges score.

But for the other award shows which are more heavily based on digital performance, I think it's probably down to M.C. The Max and Chung Ha. I am hoping Chung Ha takes it.

The K-pop girl group TWICE is on a world tour this year, and after 1 million ticket applications, 15 concerts are sold out.

According to Billboard Japan, the group immediately sold out after 1 million fans requested tickets to upcoming shows in cities like Hokkaido, Chiba, Osaka, Miyagi, Aichi, Fukuoka, and Shizuoka. The groups management team, JYP Entertainment, announced over the weekend that two more shows have been added to TWICEs tour at the Tokyo Dome in March 2020  making TWICE the first K-pop girl group to ([**Read More..**](https://www.ticketnews.com/2019/10/twices-japan-shows-1-million-ticket-applications/)**)**

I'm in no way a graphic designer or a professional, but when my monkey brain sees something pretty, it likes it.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal favorites are:

[BTS - The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever](https://imgur.com/GtFEfz5)

Absolutely beautiful. The seven of them in a hot air balloon makes me nostalgic for something that never existed. Looking at it makes me long for old friendships. It's simple in its design, but it has a lot to it.

&amp;#x200B;

[f(x) - 4 Walls](https://imgur.com/8GM9sFS)

 Maybe I'm biased because I LOVE f(x), but this album is bold and popping. The design is not overwhelming and who doesn't want to stare at their god-tier visuals?

&amp;#x200B;

[Epik High - Shoebox](https://imgur.com/E65OEkt)

Even though this album looks like the cover for an indie pop band, it is soooo pretty. I want this framed in my house so I can look at it while I cry over how much money I've spent on kpop. (Side note: Tablo's Podcast is absolutely hilarious and I recommend everyone to check it out.)

&amp;#x200B;

[BTS - Love Yourself Albums](https://imgur.com/SMlFpKy)

A lot of people didn't like the cover for these albums because it was too simple, but personally I loved them for that. The way the designs are all connected together and spell ""LOVE YOURSELF"" and got nominated for a Grammy? Iconic.

&amp;#x200B;

Red Velvet - ReVe Festival [Day 1](https://imgur.com/ZzrVz5l) &amp; [Day 2](https://imgur.com/FeRVatG)

This screams summer bop! Red Velvet's concepts this year have been my absolute favorite so far. Honestly, all of their albums could make this list, but these two are my favorite they have done so far. (btw Umpah Umpah &gt; Zimzalabim)

&amp;#x200B;

I've liked Pentagon since their pre-debut show Pentagon Maker and I know some of the members may go off to the military next year, so I figured I'd see them when I had the chance. TBH I haven't been following them super closely lately but I watched a bunch of clips before the show and remembered how much I liked them ~~and how annoyed I still am at Cube for losing them the hype from Shine~~. So glad I went!

The show itself was Friday evening at the Bataclan Theater in Paris. The venue itself was really nice, actually, but TBH being in that theater also made me a bit nervous. Everything about the venue and security was all smooth and normal, though. I had balcony tickets since I can't stand for an entire concert and was worried I wouldn't be able to see much, but actually had a nice view even though I was in the fifth row; the balcony is laid out really well.

I got there at about 3:30 for the show at 7:00; lining up for the balcony started at 5:00 but I didn't realize I needed to grab a number for the line so ended up pretty far back in the line. Whoops. There were some fans (fansites?) handing out pictures of the members to people while in line; I asked for a Jinho one initially. They had some leftover at the end and were frantically giving them to everyone going into the show, so I got a Shinwon one as well.

The show was actually Yanan's birthday, so even though he's sitting out of the tour due to injury, fans passed out little banners for him before the show and told everyone to wave them during Spring Snow (...I think it was during Spring Snow? I don't remember which song exactly.) So everyone sang Happy Birthday afterward the song.... and then Kino made everyone sing it again so he could record it on his phone to send to Yanan. Pentagon seemed to really appreciate it!

The show itself was super fun! Pentagon's concept is all about having a good time on stage and it really shows. The set list was similar to what I saw online; mostly their title tracks and their bright, upbeat b-sides with an emphasis on more recent songs - I really like their upbeat songs the most, so I was really happy with the track list. Kino/Yeoone/Hui/Yuto also did a cover of Bad Guy Billie Eilish with a sexy concept and Jinho/Shinwon/Hongseok/Wooseok did a cover of Best Song Ever (totally bet that was Shinwon's idea).

Hongseok's parents were also at the show for their anniversary! He mentioned it during one of their talk sections and everyone applauded really loudly. His parents were in the first row in the balcony not too far from where I was, so I peaked over and saw his dad was recording a closeup of him for a bunch of songs, so that was super cute.

Other miscellaneous thoughts about the show: Kino's such a good dancer, but also Yeoone was much more charismatic on stage than I expected; I've never really noticed him much before. He and Shinwon threw a ton of water on the crowd during the encore, haha. Hui really likes to tease the members on stage; he and Jinho are *such* good vocals and so stable live. Jinho flashed Hongseok's abs at one point and then Hui mimed like he would do the same to Jinho. They all practiced some French phrases, which was really cute, and the crowd went wild for it.

The show lasted about 2 hours and I had to leave right after so I could make the last train home, but I did get a little Pentagon wristband while waiting for my ride. Really had a fun time, they're super fun to see in person!",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Obviously it's hard to rank the songs objectively and unbiased, so the more popular groups will have the more popular songs. I tried evaluating the songs regardless of my preference among the groups.  
Here is my personal ranking:

1. AOA - Sorry  
The more I listen to this song, the more I like it. It does sound somehow generic and western, but it's very easy to listen to and enjoyable. It's probably the least dramatic of the songs.
2. Oh My ~~Gril~~ Girl - Guerilla  
Classic OMG sound that I love. The high synths in the second part of the chorus are divine. Some harmonies feel a bit 2010(?) but all in all pretty satisfying.
3. (G)I-DLE - LION  
Classic Idle sound, but the most heavy-hitting of their songs to date imo. Minnie's high note is amazing and Soyeon's rap too, and Shuhua finally got her lines. I always have to chuckle when I hear them saying ""Quin"".
4. Mamamoo - Destiny  
Very reminiscent of Starry Night. Moonbyul's rap is really good in this song, and obviously the vocals are incredibly strong. The drop however is irritating, it's underwhelming, almost doesn't feel like one, and the fast-spoken lyrics before it are unsatisfying to me. Except for that part though, it's very nice, easy-going and calm.
5. Park Bom - Wanna Go Back  
This song is aiming to be really emotional and sad and, well, it achieves that goal. It is a really strong and harmonious ballad. However, it's not something I'd listen to often, just because it really brings me down emotionally.
6. Lovelyz - Moonlight  
As you can probably tell from my flair, ranking Lovelyz last hurts me a lot. During Queendom, it has been explicitly shown that Lovelyz should stick to their lovely style, because that's just what they do best, and better than anyone else. That's why Moonlight surprised me. The song is good and would have fitted other groups well, but... It is generic and the airhorns are outdated. I'm glad that because Kei already got her stage with Hwasa, the other main vocalists got more lines though.",31,49,False,self,,,,,

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.
