7,2017-07-01,2017,7,1,10,6kk7jh,Stellar is doing an ARG as a part of their comeback,PraetorHyper,1498872059,"Stellar recently made their comeback [Archangels of the Sephiroth](https://youtu.be/9ivBktSZ8yQ) and it came with an ARG that revolves around the kabbalistic philosophy of the Tree of Life. Their [new site](http://www.stellarintotheworld.com/) has puzzles and some clues under the 32path tab. So far we've solved three of the puzzles and are working towards solving the others by unlocking more clues visiting a specific site you reached through a QR code that's on the MV. 

I found this really interesting since I've never heard of a kpop group doing something this elaborate for their fans, and we believe part of the game is choosing a ""concept"" for a new video or an album release (the Awakening tab has some kind of voting platform for choosing between two concepts for each of the members that we unlocked today by visiting another website that mirrors the one on the QR). 

If you want to join the fun we are working towards cracking the codes at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/0x0k79hXCpPKR3P2) and most of the info we've uncovered on each of the puzzles is at [this site](https://sephirothtree.wordpress.com/).",17,198

11,2017-07-01,2017,7,1,11,6kkgrg,What group did you used to stan and what made you stop?,agust__d,1498875250,"A lot of us kpop fans get really attached to certain groups, often for years and years and even after the group disbands. So I'm curious what makes those feelings fade away? In particular, if you're still invested in other groups, rather than growing out of the kpop scene as a whole.

For me, it was EXO. I was a hardcore stan who kept up with their every promotion, teaser, interview, etc for years. But now, their comebacks barely register on my radar. I think it was a combination of their music style and the change in their dynamic after members left. They're amazing performers and entertainers, but their content aligned less and less with my taste. No regrets, but it's weird to look at this group I spent a lot of my time and money on and realize I don't care anymore.",530,154
12,2017-07-01,2017,7,1,11,6kki76,Why does kpop make you happy?,Yayalani,1498875762,"I'm thinking right now, I realized that kpop really makes me happy. I listen to all types of music and they all make me feel good I stopped listening to kpop for a while and I constantly would catch myself extremely sad. Yes I would feel happy but for the most part I was sad. I'm not sure if I was depressed or not. I wasn't suicidal, I would think about death a lot though and. I wanted to die. I wouldn't kill myself but I wouldn't mind it If i died. I found myself in this circle. I never had hope for anything. I started listening to kpop about a month ago again and man I feel happier like I didn't when I first started listening to it . I feel like the world isn't so small anymore. It makes me feel excited about life about everything that there is to see. I wanna go places. I want to listen different languages. I don't know. But then again school ended about 2 months ago. I'm not sure if it's kpop or that stressful school is over. Maybe it's both? I always felt very stupid at school. I felt stressed about picking up grades. I felt embarrassed about my grades. I used to be very talkative and I c hanged a lot. I hated going to school I hated talking to people. But now I'm not as bad as I used to be. But the whole reason I started thinking this is because I thinking about if I die today how sad I'd be not being able to experience all the things I want to now. Yes I was sad about DYING. I don't want to die anymore. Maybe I'm dumb or just childish. Idk what it is I just wanted to open up. ",59,112

The chorus of a song is most likely why i would enjoy the song but there are these specific songs where the verses bring you in to enjoy the song again. Any songs r/kpop can think of?

The Town Hall is an opportunity for the mods to make announcements and propose changes, while also getting feedback from you guys about those changes and the current state of the subreddit.  Please feel free to comment about any issues that have been bothering you, and give any suggestions you may have to make r/kpop a more enjoyable place.

1.	CSS Tweaks
2.	Reddit Front Page Posts
3.	Title Guidelines
4.	Upcoming Census

&amp;nbsp;

#### CSS Tweaks

Thanks to the awesome work of /u/kilenaitor, we've been making some strides in improving the CSS on the subreddit.  Obviously, the big news was the introduction of [searching and filtering by flair.](https://redd.it/6jlrpl)  Now that everyone has been using this feature for the past week, let us know if you have any suggestions on ways we can improve it.  We've also added a link to ""The Show"" archive in the sidebar, arranged the music shows in order from Tuesday to Sunday, and made some visual improvements to 'Night Mode' in RES.  Lastly, we made some tweaks to thumbnails by making them a bit wider to better display widescreen pictures.  We're still working on tweaking those, so it's not perfect yet, but we're getting there.  Please comment below if you have any other ideas or suggestions for changes in the CSS to improve the look or usability of the subreddit.


&amp;nbsp;

#### Reddit Front Page Posts

We've had several recent occurrences of K-pop related posts reaching the ""Front Page"" of Reddit via other subreddits.

* [Example 1](https://redd.it/6ju1ai)
* [Example 2](https://redd.it/6dqvb7)
* [Example 3](https://redd.it/6da10a)
* [Example 4](https://redd.it/61k52q)

This isn't exactly ""news"" and it seems to be happening more frequently lately, so are posts like these something you still want to see on /r/kpop?  One thing to note is that all of these posts have been incredibly popular on the subreddit with each generating over 500 points.  The mod team thinks they're fine, however there seems to a growing number of users who want these posts to stop, so we're interested in hearing your thoughts on them.  Please let us know if you think they're fine, or if you think they should be banned.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Title Guidelines

The last section of [the rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_iii._title_formatting_guide) contains our title formatting guidelines.  It outlines what information should be present in a title and how it should be formatted.  Lately, we've been fairly lax on enforcing these guidelines and allowing more titles that stray from them, sometimes significantly.  We're worried that this may have a negative effect on the readability of the subreddit.  We'd like feedback on whether you want mods to be more strict on title format, or if you're fine with varying title formats as long as all the important info is there and mostly in English. 

&amp;nbsp;

#### Upcoming Census

Our annual r/kpop census is coming up in August.  It's a short survey that tells us all about who we are as a subreddit.  One of the questions on the census is ""What are your favorite K-pop artists?""  In the past, we have had a whole bunch of checkboxes and some write-in blanks to gather answers.  Unfortunately, this has been a nightmare to parse and tally, and with the subreddit growing every day, it's not feasible to do it that way again.  We're looking for suggestions from you guys on ways that we can capture the answer to that question within the limitations of Google Forms and in a way that it easier to work with.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",109,53

JYP has the nation's girl group TWICE, who will be JYP's breadwinner for years to come once 2PM enlists in the army.

I'll explain this by copying what was said over there. 

&gt; People can either comment something looking to help out others or something to find new music they like.

&gt; ***Examples***:

&gt; If you like **X** (specific song or group), you might like **Y**(specific song or group).

&gt;or another option is to simply say

&gt; **X**

&gt; Which would require some replies to recommend something you might enjoy that is similar in style to **X**.

I will start us off:

If you like [Hyukoh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr4GaRPX6cM), I recommend [Dasutt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY6yYIvoBqU)

Also, I would like a song or band that has a similar style to [John Park - DND](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6_IK4Tt_PQ), which I discovered very recently and am absolutely loving.

Edit: Also, feel free to ask for non Korean music, and then to get recommendations from there if you are new here.",216,128

104,2017-07-02,2017,7,2,4,6kp08g,What K-pop songs have you noticed have disappeared from Spotify?,hexlordsaturn,1498938105,"I have a lot of my k-pop on spotify, and lately I notice the number on my playlist goes down and some of my favorite songs have started to disappear. Since I listen to so much and I'm sure many of you do as well, it's hard to keep track of everything. It's even harder because more often than not, songs disappear randomly but other music by the respective group is still there, and there's groups who don't put much of their music or any of it on Spotify so it's hard to remember if it was there to begin with. Sometimes songs disappear for a while and then come back, too. In order to help each other find what's gone missing, I thought I'd post about it so everyone can share what they've noticed too. Let's help each other out :-) if you want to check what's missing from your playlists, you can see the unplayable songs on desktop or [follow this to see it in the app.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6kp08g/what_kpop_songs_have_you_noticed_have_disappeared/djnu91p/)

(Sidenote: Sometimes I've noticed songs return after a while, for example, Red by Hyuna, so **if anything you add comes back, let us know!** I'll try to update my original list if they come back too. **Sometimes things are only missing in specific regions, so it may be there for some of you and may not be for others! please try to include your region if you're comfortable.** for reference, I am in the US!! **Please try to be specific with what's missing**, I don't stan every single group mentioned so I can't tell what's missing without specifics for quite a few of these groups and singers.)


**Here is a complete list from what I have noticed and what others have said below.** I will try to update it as much as I can. I will also try to link credit to whoever pointed it out but I can only do so much so I'm sorry if I miss anyone! Ones without credit are ones I personally noticed before posting this or  it's because I'm on mobile and I'll add links later. I'm also sorry if I don't include a few because I'm confused as to how you formatted your lists lol. 

**UPDATE**: I have also now added the links to songs people have found under different names or under unofficial releases etc.

**Songs/Albums/Etc that are missing only in certain regions** -- if you know other regions that things I mention are missing in please let me know and I'll add them.

* Young Forever - BTS, missing in the U.S.

* How's This - Hyuna, [missing in Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6kp08g/what_kpop_songs_have_you_noticed_have_disappeared/djnyn07/), and now I can't find it in the US anymore. It's just the title track for me, the rest of the mini is there.

* Number 9 - T-ARA, [missing in Canada.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6kp08g/what_kpop_songs_have_you_noticed_have_disappeared/djnwsbs/)  [It is also missing in Sweeden.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6kp08g/what_kpop_songs_have_you_noticed_have_disappeared/djnvo2h/) You can still find the song on the repackage, Again 1977, under its Korean name [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/4B9HB25lHuAodw3m5IBSwF), the normal Again album also under its korean name [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/7MjfrbpKNu4sV4RFbVVdDC), and it is reportedly also on the greatest hits album in most countries (I don't have a link for that one, I don't think the greatest hits album is on Spotify in the US).

* [Dreamcatcher's first single, missing in unconfirmed countries.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6kp08g/what_kpop_songs_have_you_noticed_have_disappeared/djo0hmk/) I would say this has never been there but if it appears greyed out it might be out there somewhere, but I am not sure.


**Songs/Albums/Etc that weren't on Spotify to begin with (as far as we know)**

* Anything by any artist under JYP, although a few songs might show up randomly and it also might be regional, but I am not entirely sure. Mixed answers on this one.

123,2017-07-02,2017,7,2,12,6kr5vi,170701 NCT 127 MuCore Prerec,jolaurence,1498964788,"This fan account is the last fan account for me for Cherry Bomb promotions unless I magically get into a fansign on a weekend. I'm not even sure how to explain this promotion period because it felt so rushed. I don't even know if I want to call this a promotion period for 127. This is also gonna be longer on the whole process of getting into the show because this was a mess. I was gonna post this after midnight Sunday here in Korea but I ended up spending the rest of my Saturday socializing with fandom friends. 

Anyway, the notices for both MuCore and Inki went up around 2:20 pm and the number was then posted shortly after that. The usual. I decided against Inki because of the very small allotment and by the time I got there, I would have too high of a check in number. 

There was an issue with the MuCore list. This is what I understood because everyone was talking about it on twitter and what not. The list maker's phone got way too many texts sent in at the same time and it stopped working. But people kept showing up and taking their pictures since that is what you do. Then everything stopped. Even though there were numbers already given out, the issue was too big. So she asked everyone who sent their number to her to take a screenshot send it to her and they would do numbers that way. 

But it took way too long. People were are at the DMC waiting because no numbers were being given. People had numbers but then not anymore because of the issue so they had to get new numbers. But fans were getting so angry so the list girl stopped giving numbers and locked the twitters. Fans got angry again. Then, they asked for someone else to make a new notice list since they had experience before and she did. So then people had to get on a second list.

Then, suddenly List Girl 1 decided to give numbers again while List Girl 2 was #4 on List 1. List Girl 2 was already giving out new numbers. So they basically talked it out that she would be taking over giving numbers because List Girl 1 wanted to not be attached to it at all because then she would get the blame when it was her fault. Basically, this was a mess already. 

When I got there, I looked at the notice and a girl pointed at me to take the picture so I did. At that time, they were announcing the decision. List 1 was no longer valid. List 2 was. Wait. Both lists are wrong. Gonna start over. No. Back to List 2. But List 1 might fight to get their list accepted as the true list. 

Then it was officially decided that List 2 was the list and that check in starts at 8:10 am. There is a new girl in charge, #4 of List 1. But if there wasn't a true solution to this then SM staff would have to make a decision. Apparently this has happened to EXO as well. And what happens is a literal fight to the death. What happens is you run. It's called . 0/10 would not recommend.

So I got my number and then took a bus home, slept for a few hours, and then came back to see how everything would play out. I was on List 2. But I had friends on List 1. Around 8:05 suddenly they started having List 1 line up. They were gonna honor that list. Meanwhile, all of us in List 2 lined up in our lines and we waited. List 1 was given numbers and waited on one side while Line 2 had their phones checked for what phone number they sent in to. 

So we waited. And waited. All of the Line girls started talking and then one of the SM staff ladies came so they ran over to her to tell her what happened. There was no solution between the lines. Another staff worker came and the two of them kept talking. Line 1 was moved to be closer to Line 2. A lot of us stood up because we were nervous. Staff told us that they would make a decision at 9:30 am. 

9:30 comes around and all of us are super stressed. Fans were asking for us to run instead and I was like ""nope."" I have heard the horror stories from EXO-Ls. There was so much shouting going on. Then staff told us the decision: they were gonna honor Line 2. Line 1 would be added into Line 2. Each of the number lines would get 10 people from Line 1. The List 1 and List 2 girls were cut because of what happened. 

As they were combining, they started to give us our tiers and then numbers. The stress was over for me. I was N1. They moved the process pretty fast because of what happened with the lines. We got into our tier lines and then headed over towards the venue where I saw Pink Panda. They signed as many of the fan cards as possible before letting us in. 

We had our bags checked twice as we headed in due to what is happening with APink. Those poor angels do not deserve this happening to them. As I walked in, I saw that Blackpink was gonna be happening before us. I freaked out. I was finally seeing them!!!! 

All of us in my section where I sat, which was on the left where you can see the boys enter and exit, were excited because it's Blackpink. We were bopping along to the song while Blinks were being super loud up front. They were so cute too! More NCTzens who would be sitting were let in in between the takes for Blackpink. There was not as many people inside like normal. After they were done, their fans were let out and I saw two military men there. Yup. 

Finally it was time for NCT 127. My side saw them come out and we instantly started to scream while staff told us to be quiet. We always do this. Balloons were ready. Light sticks on. Taeyong's birthday. One of the most stressful lines in a while. 

This song in general is just deadly. The boys did one rehearsal with the name tags on and two takes. The fan chants were intense, most likely because of someone's birthday, and the screams for Mark and Haechan. Okay in general the screams for Mark are out of this world. In general seeing Mark perform is like an out of body experience. Also, can these two stop growing up on us. They looked so good. Plus, the screams for when Mark does ""head shot"" dnnjdjsjdhdbb. I have to keysmash because we kinda go off. Hype crew. 

We were told by staff to not be so loud during the playback so we just ""oooooo""d and ""ahhhhh""d at the screen. There were a lot of screams for Winwin actually. Before one of the takes, Doyoung came on stage and he shushed us. Before the first take the camera was looking at Mark and Taeyong and they kept making faces. After the first playback, my section clapped. For the second take, Mark was one of the last to go on so we all cheered. They were gonna get into place but suddenly Mark ran on stage. 

(Also, you bet I scream my head off whenever Johnny has a part in this song. You bet I do.)

In general, this song is exhausting. By the time of the dance break I am so tired and I can see that the boys are so tired. Yet, I get so hyped watching this. When they boys do the dance break, we go all out with the chants. And then when it comes to the point of the song when they drop down and then do the leg split, we are all screaming our heads off. My voice was slightly dying as well. 

After the second take ended, staff went around telling us that we would be singing Happy Birthday. So Jaehyun started it off and we all sang to Taeyong and ahhhhh this precious puppy. They put a crown on his head making him look like a prince (which he is anyway). While he spoke, he kept looking over at Jaehyun and Jaehyun told him to keep going. Taeyong told us that he checked on SNS at midnight for his birthday greetings and said that we were all cute. But we were screaming back at him. He was so thankful towards us but really, we are thankful for him. He wanted Jaehyun to say something but Jaehyun told Taeyong to keep talking. They did their greeting and bowed and Taeyong's crown fell off. The members quickly went off stage bowing to staff. My section kept looking at the side to get one of the members to look at us and wave. I think Doyoung did. 

As we left, Arohas came in because next was Astro. I got back in line to get my fancard signed and did that. As I left I saw one of the two trucks for Taeyong. I didn't get in line because I needed to get the birthday card for a friend so I went with two of my friends to the DDP to buy an album. As we walked to the subway station, I saw that Astro had an ice cream truck prepared for Arohas. What angels. I was asked if I was entering for the anniversary fan meeting on Thursday and I said no because I have to work. The poor staff took pity on me. But I got a Johnny photocard so it's all good. 

And with that, my Cherry Bomb promotions are over. It went by too quick. Hopefully SM will add a few fansigns for the month of July but the boys are busy with SMTOWN in Seoul as well as Tokyo and Osaka. I'll be seeing them again on Saturday for SMTOWN. But still, way too short for me. ",8,46

The moment they announced it, I was committed to getting in. It's been a tough, long week, but it was so so worth it in the end. 

When I prepared for the fansign, I just expected the worst that I wouldn't get in... but I preemptively bought head pieces for each of the members just for the ""what ifs"". I wrote a letter to Ros and found her some Hot Cheetos (her favorite!). 

I arrived at the venue at around 4:00 PM. I walked around a bit, scouted the area since it was an open fansign. An absurd amount of people were already set up around the area with their huge cameras. I waited for a friend to arrive and we went to draw our numbers together. At 4:30, I drew number 43/120, which wasn't too bad! Now, all I could do was wait.

They let people in at around 5:30 PM and I was getting pretty anxious/nervous/excited. My friend was also in my row and we were pretty close to them, I would say. However, as it approached the time of the fansign, something terrible  happened. A girl in my row had a seizure (it was reported due to a severe lack of sleep and stress). Everybody gave her the space she needed and she got taken away by medical professionals afterwards. She responded a little bit after it was over and I sincerely do hope she recovers well. It was really scary to see it happen. It's just one of those moments you don't know what will happen and it just happens... I sincerely wish her a speedy recovery. BLACKPINK arrived right when this happened and it worried the girls a lot. The fansign was postponed for half an hour, which was very understandable. 

Well, when it began, the girls came out again with smiles on their faces. I met some really nice people while waiting, too! There were a fair amount of English speakers in the audience. 

Without further ado here are my interactions with each member in order:

- Lisa: I walked up to Lisa really shaken up since I didn't know what to say. So, the first thing I told her was, ""Hey Lisa, we have the same birthday!"" She looked up to me and just flipped the freak out. She replied, ""WHAT REALLY NO WAY!"" I felt Lisa was genuinely excited and bubbly throughout the entire thing. I was pretty stunned to finally meet them I kinda didn't know what else to say. I gifted her these [devil horns](https://i.imgur.com/wNkvaJL.jpg) that seems to be making it around [twitter](https://twitter.com/_S2_970327/status/881461799375126529) :). I high five'd her and waited for my turn with Ros.

- Ros: This girl is genuinely lovely. She was about to say hi to me in Korean until she saw my name on the sticky note...and she god damn killed me with that accent. She turned on that English and I just stood there frozen. I handed her my gift to her and she asked ""huh what's this?"" She put the bag in her lap, looked down and exclaimed ""WHAAAAT, HOT CHEETOSS!!!!"" She quickly asked where I came from and she looked soooooo happy. I responded, ""they're your favorite, right?"" And she replied ""oh my god yes, they are my favorite!!"" She told me to wait (before I moved on to the next member) as she wrote thank you on my postcard (in addition to her signature of course) and gave me a really peppy high five. She really showed her appreciation and I genuinely adore her for that! I also gifted her a [flower crown](https://i.imgur.com/S3oxxVI.jpg) :)

- Jennie: Oh boy. I didn't know what to expect with Jennie. She signed my name, asked where I came from. I told her I loved her feature in G-Dragon's Black and that her vocals in that song was one of my favorites of all time. She said she loved the song as well (god damn her accent was something else). I gifted her a really nice [headpiece](https://i.imgur.com/UbeBk65.jpg) and she asked ""oh is this for me?"" She gave me the sweeetest thank you I've ever heard in my life. Jennie is such a genuine sweetheart. 

- Jisoo: The first moment I approached Jisoo, I gave her the [headpiece](https://i.imgur.com/ZoU9O0u.jpg) I got for her. She smiled and laughed a lot and put it on (Jisoo is low key obsessed with chicken)! I told her she was really funny and weird (in a good way) and she said thank you many times. She was really happy and her smile is really bright. She gave me a bunch of hearts before saying thank you one more time. After I sat down, she continued to play and wear the [headband](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDvCxCPUIAE-GZc.jpg) - I'm glad she had so much fun with it.

as i walked off the stage, they gave us lipstick from a brand they endorsed. cool. 

and yeah, that's pretty much it. i think i died. 

oh yeah, also attended their ice cream event the other day and it was honestly the best ice cream i've ever had. totally not biased or anything. 

thanks for reading. ",48,374

210,2017-07-03,2017,7,3,10,6kwzss,How do you organize your KPop files?,Novadestin,1499045778,"I'm currently working on re-vamping my KPop folder so that it's more organized, and in doing so, I got curious about what other people do. For me, I have to have things organized and labeled lol my new system is: company folder, group folders ordered by debut date, era folders (ie Korean releases) ordered by date (with sub era folders for any side projects, foreign releases, etc), and then each era folder is organized by the dates of whatever happened during that time frame. 

So, for example, my Gugudan folder is like this: 
CJ E&amp;M Music - Jellyfish Entertainment &gt; 160628 Gugudan &gt; 160628 Era 1 - Act. 1 The Little Mermaid K EP &gt; 160628 Songs, 160630 SBS FM Kim Chang Ryul's Old School, etc etc

I keep all official videos (like from Youtube and such) in their own folder, but otherwise everything is organized like the above. I also put all the images and gifs that go with specific videos in the same folder too, rather than having two separate (but completely identical) folder systems. And, when I'm all done, I give all the folders nice custom icons cause I'm a visual person and hate Microsoft's manila folders xP

And, just for fun, how big is your KPop folder anyways? lol are you the kind of person who has to ""save everything at top notch quality"" or do you only save what you really love? Last I checked, mine was over 2TB (like 80% of which is Vixx hahahaha). ",24,24

Been in K-Pop a little after the new millennium (I saw DB5K debut lmao) as an international fan so I've seen my fair share of rise &amp; falls.

THOUGHT WOULDN'T MAKE IT BIG

* SNSD - just had too much antis pre-debut. It was at this point that everyone was saying K-Pop is so not ready for girlgroups because boygroups are dominating, and a lot of the fangirls were crazy possessive. Also vocally, a lot of the trainees then didn't seem to have the vocal prowess of the female acts active in this era like BoA, Ivy &amp; even Jewelry's Jungah. No one knew who Taeyeon was pre-debut &amp; Jessica/Tiff/Stella/Hyo were the most famously known female SM trainees. It was an era where singing &gt; dancing.

* Big Bang - their concept was just too new &amp; none of the boys looked ""celebrity-like"" (the term idols didn't come up till like 09-10) to the audience who preferred their boybands to look like DBSK or SS501. The group also lacked ""power vocals"" (the style that was in back then was more like the classing belting ala DBSK or SG Wannabe rather than the style YG uses)

* Wonder Girls - again, they debuted in an era when people were saying ""the industry isn't ready for girl groups""

* Beast/Highlight..or back then we knew them as B2ST lol - too many company/boygroup rejects &amp; visually didn't really fit the ""look"" fans were after during that era

* BTS - small company, their debut concept was overdone by the time they debuted, weird lyrics but they're now top level defying all the odds

* IU - because she debuted in a time when groups seem to thrive but soloists struggle


THOUGHT WOULD MAKE IT BIG

* CSJH - they were dubbed as the female DBSK but that obviously didn't happen

* ZeA - they had so much buzz when they debuted 
* C-Clown - they had the visuals &amp; music that seemed friendly enough to both Korean &amp; intl fans but they still flopped
* IKON - they were such monster rookies during debut people were expecting them to be EXO level popularity-wise &amp; to lead the Hallyu wave further &amp; all that shizz but they're now struggling to even outsell Astro
* Got7 - they got so much buzz pre-debut &amp; while they're huge internationally, I've realized they're not even that huge in Korea...even among the youngins. People were predicting they'll be at least like 2pm popularity-wise but they're yet to churn out an iconic hit like Again &amp; Again - a lot of Koreans can't even recognize their songs sadly.
* Hello Venus - those visuals
* FT Island - their debut song was a national hit
* Son Dambi - a lot of mediaplay about her predebut
* Battle - the boyband Shinhwa created to be the second them. Had a lot of buzz then disappeared out of thin air.

I ended up having a hard time narrowing the nine or ten songs I had kept my eye on down to six, and in the end, it really came down to a matter of which songs I thought would be best to listen to in the summertime. Thus, the following six songs are songs that will lift you up; songs that will get you moving and songs that will have you singing along. Without further ado, here are my picks for the month of June 2017!

---

[R&amp;B / Dance] [Crush - Outside (ft. Beenzino)](https://youtu.be/L_VFUhB2xPA)
&gt;Outside is the eponymous title track on Crushs recently released EP. It features rapper Beenzino in what is, in my opinion, an incredibly strong contender for song of the year. It has summer vibes all over it, and the hilarious music video does the song no disfavors in making it a wonderful release.

[R&amp;B / Rap] [Heize - Don't Know You](https://youtu.be/vvkWaI91mLM)
&gt;Heize is a rapper/singer-songwriter who came to fame through her performance in Unpretty Rapstar, the female version of South Koreas popular rap competition Show Me The Money.  She has made quite a name for herself through her ability to write, sing and rap her own songs, and Im always impressed by how deep and innovative her lyrics and melodies are.

&gt;Although Dont Know You is labeled as a Rap/Hip-Hop song, I would say it falls more under House/Dance. This is because it doesnt really go as hard as a typical rap/hip-hop song, and the foundation of the piece is clearly its bumpin groove and soaring melodies. Dont Know You is Heizes sorrowful expression of a lost love, a love whose meaning she only realized after it left.

[Ballad / Folk] [Taeil x Sejeong - Loves Me, Loves Me Not](https://youtu.be/FBnxOIjExHs)
&gt;Loves Me, Loves Me Not is a sweet love song, the theme of which you have probably heard elsewhere: does (s)he love me or does (s)he not?

&gt;It is a ballad/folk duo featuring Taeil, a member of the boy-band Block B, and Sejeong, a member of the girl-group Gugudan. It was produced by Park Kyung, who is also in Block B.

[Rap] [BewhY - Scar](https://youtu.be/vxnbFVRTbhQ)
&gt;BewhY is one of Koreas most well-known rappers. He won last years season of Show Me The Money, South Koreas most rigorous and competitive rap competition. He beat out the likes of powerhouse names  C-Jamm, Reddy, Superbee and Flowsik (although its not to say that the competition was entirely free of bias)  and has quickly soared to national prominence through his strong conservative appeal coupled with his incredible lyrical precision.

&gt;BewhY hides nothing about his faith when it comes to his music, and it shows clearly, without a trace of a doubt, in Scar. Scar is BewhYs message to the world that hes not messing around. Hes willing to die for what he believes in, even if the lies of deceit try to strangle him. He raps about life and death, light and darkness, and most importantly, becoming a trace in the midst of the flow that is history. Scar left a deep impression on me, and it hope it does for you as well.

[R&amp;B / Soul] [Suran - 1+1=0 (ft. DEAN)](https://youtu.be/YA6G74gk6R8)
&gt;Walkin is Surans first official EP, and it did not disappoint  nope, not at all. Every song on Walkin is wonderful, and it definitely deserves a full listen. But unfortunately, this post is not about the Walkin in its entirety  its about 1+1=0.

&gt;1+1=0 is a collab between Suran and R&amp;B singer-songwriter DN. The message of the song is that were still young so we should take our time and relax our mind. Sometimes, 1+1  in other words: working all day, every day  amounts to nothing. We should also be careful with how we spend our time and make sure that were doing something that were passionate about.

[Special Mention] [Hash Swan - MA$HIMARO](https://youtu.be/74cKzlYmCR4)
&gt;Ah, special mention time.

&gt;This time weve got another fun electronic/rap bop by Hash Swan, another rapper who was in last years season of Show Me The Money.

&gt;Although Hash Swan only made it to the 3rd round of SMTM5, the public and judges recognized his talent, flow and unique voice. He was signed to Ambition Musik, a sub-label of 1llionare Records, after the show ended, and hes been making rounds throughout the music industry with collaborations such as Walkin feat. Jimin Park of 15&amp; (what a coincidence) and Piggy Bank with DayDay. He also came out with his second EP in February titled Shangri-La. I listened to it and am giving it two thumbs up.

&gt;Im not quite sure what MA$HIMARO is about to be quite honest. Ive listened to it a lot and even read through the English lyrics a few times, but it still doesnt make much sense to me. Maybe that should be a reason for me to keep improving my Korean skills Regardless, I think its a great summer track, and if you like a song with good bounce and hook, then MA$HIMARO is your song.

364,2017-07-04,2017,7,4,15,6l5cqd,Announcing /r/kpop's Top Ten Tuesdays! Explanation + schedule voting inside,almost_tragic,1499148910,"Inspired by /r/hiphopheads and /r/indieheads I've decided to start Top Ten Tuesdays on /r/kpop with the moderation team's support. 
 
[Here's an example of a voting thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/6idd4s/top_ten_tuesday_bob_dylan/)

[Here's an example of a results thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/6jpbt9/our_top_ten_bob_dylan_songs/)

Every Tuesday /r/kpop will vote on a Group's/Subunit's/Artist's top 10 songs. I will count all the votes Sunday and post the results on Monday. 

The voting is very straight forward. You rank your top 10 songs. #1 get 10 points, #2 gets 9 points, #3 get 8 points etc. The 10 songs that get the most points will be /r/kpop's top 10 songs by that group/subunit/artist. We will keep all past results updated on a Reddit wiki page that will look something like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12RX0aHpXzpwJiSAEH9U-XjNaYSYRg3f3_KE_D53aicY/edit#gid=938453559)

As you can see these threads will be fun, inspire good discussion and create an amazing tool for newcomers or anyone that wants to get into a new group.

Now it's time for you to vote on which groups/subunits/artists you'd like to see featured on /r/kpop's Top Ten Tuesdays using this method. 

Some rules for this voting thread:

* Rank the 10 groups/subunits/artists that you want featured on /r/kpop Top Ten Tuesdays, DO NOT rank them in reverse order because Reddit's formatting doesn't like that. 

*  #1 get 10 points, #2 gets 9 points, #3 get 8 points etc.

* Upvoting/Downvoting someone else's ranking won't affect the results. 

* Groups, subunits and artists are considered separate, so you can put Tiffany at #1, SNSD at #2, Taeyeon at #6 and TTS at #10 for ex. (Note: If a solo song appears on a group/subunit album, 
 it's considered to be part of the subunit's/group's discography.)

* If a group/subunit/artist has released 2-9 songs and you want to see /r/kpop rank them you can put that group in your top ten. (ex: KARD, BlackPink, MOBB, Hyoyeon)

* Don't give another user crap for their ranking that would be uncool

* Rember this is also a discussion not every comment has to be a ranking, have fun. 


Special thanks to /u/SirBuckeye who helped make this happen.


Edit: I have to go to bed now. I'll reply to any questions/upvote all new comments in about 8 hours.

Can't believe I was worried that not many people would be interested :P.

375,2017-07-04,2017,7,4,17,6l5wmr,K-Pop Music Spotlight  TVXQ,Kilenaitor,1499157711,"### Intro
Welcome to the second installment of our K-Pop Music Spotlight series! Last time was [Epik High](https://redd.it/6eq0hc); this time is one of the most famous groups of all time: DBSK! a.k.a  a.k.a DB5K a.k.a Rising Gods of the East a.k.a TVXQ! a.k.a TVfXQ a.k.a . DBSK is one of the most famous and influential K-Pop groups to ever grace the airwaves. They are a pop powerhouse and it causes me physical pain whenver I see people on this sub not know who they are. Time to fix that! 

For the sake of clarity, and as a bit of an intro, the group used to consist of five members: U-Know Yunho, Max Changmin, Hero Jaejoong, Micky Yoochun, and Xiah Junsu. However, in 2010, **J**aejoong, **Y**oochun, and **J**unsu left the group (for reasons that will be discussed) to form their own group *JYJ*. In this writeup, I will refer to the 5-member group as *DBSK* and the 2-member group as *TVXQ!* (the current name SM promotes them under); *JYJ* will be written as-is. 

### Members (former and current)
* U-Know Yunho
 * Leader, Main Dancer, Main Rapper, Lead Vocalist 
* Max Changmin
 * Maknae, Main Vocalist
* Hero Jaejoong
 * Visual, Lead Vocalist
* Micky Yoochun
 * Main Rapper
* Xiah Junsu
 * Main Vocalist, Lead Dancer

### Group Overview
* Years Active: **2003  Present**
* Fandom Name: **Cassiopeia** (Cassie, for short)
* Color: **Pearl Red**
* 8 Korean Albums
* 8 Japanese Albums
* Total Album Sales: **14,143,519** [Korean + Japanese] (Oct. 2016)

### The Split
Most people on this sub never got to experience DBSK as five members. I only became a K-Pop fan in 2010 so I only ever knew them mid-lawsuit, but it cannot be understated how much of a powerhouse this group was. Those 14.1 million albums above; the next highest for a Kpop group is H.O.T with 7 Million. You thought Big Bang sold a lot of albums? 3.5 Million. These guys were hugely influential to the K-Pop scene and helped solidify SM as the top record label in Korean media. 

With that, most of you probably don't know almost anything about them. I almost *never* come across a Cassie flair on this sub. You probably know them as the group that released *Mirotic* (I am not gatekeeping here; just emphasizing their lack of popularity on this sub). So how did they go from one of the most prolific and popular groups in Korea to one of the *classic* groups? Among other things, it was mostly The Lawsuit, The Split, The Schism, whichever word causes you the most pain. This was **devastating** for K-Pop fans when it occurred. What happened? 

DBSK debuted in 2003 and *immediately* shot up into success. Between 2003 and 2009 they released 4 Korean studio albums including Mirotic and 4 Japanese Albums. Then, on July 31, 2009, Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu filed lawsuit against S.M. Entertainment alleging an invalid contract agreement citing things such as their **13-year contract** was too long, schedules were set and finalized without consultation of the three, their contract had been altered without their knowledge and permission, and that the earnings of the group were not evenly distributed amongst the 5 of them (meaning they were disproportionally favoring Yunho and Changmin). The news of the lawsuit caused S.M.'s stock price to plummet 10%this was a HUGE deal. DBSK's activities in Korea were halted and S.M. held a press conference saying the reason for the lawsuit was not over fairness of the contract but instead motivated by greed. 

Following the lawsuit, Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu signed with the company that was managing DBSK's Japanese Activites, Avex Entertainment. JYJ released their debut EP *The...* in September of 2010. S.M., using their influence (although never officially), effectively blocked JYJ from ever promoting in Korea or appearing on any entertainment shows. S.M. pressured both music and variety shows to never promote or permit JYJ saying if the shows ever did, they could say goodbye to any relationship with S.M. 

Following the three separating into JYJ, DBSK was reborn as TVXQ! with just Yunho and Changmin and they resumed activities as a duo, promoting in both Korea and Japan unhindered by S.M. (and still under contract with them). 

The lawsuit was finally resolved in 2012, over 3 years after the initial filing, with both JYJ and S.M. withdrawing their litigations and S.M. saying the three members' contracts were voided on July 31, 2009. As a fun fact, in 2015, South Korea's National Assembly passed a new law saying that television programs were no longer allowed to blacklist groups from appearing without justifiable reason. The law was nicknamed the ""JYJ Law"" for obvious reasons. 

### Discography 
I am going to upset a lot of people with this but, due to the sheer amount of music they have released, I am only going to be covering their Korean releases here (this is K-Pop, after all). You are free to go explore their Japanese releases if you'd like to; I even encourage you to! But this is a long spotlight as-is. With that, lets dive in. 

#### Tri-Angle 
Seriously, this is a fantastic album through-and-through. It's no wonder they were so successful with their debut. You might think they sound dated (I swear I'm not old T_T) but I *love* the sound of this album because it just reminds me of when I really liked American pop music (N*SYNC for life).

#### Rising Sun
Another solid release from them. Overall though, the sophomore album is more mellow than their first album but in no way sacrificing quality in the process. Even if you don't like ballads very much, give these a listen! 

* [Tonight](https://youtu.be/FJlXalr3A9E)
* **[Rising Sun](https://youtu.be/2ZxK60hbX-s)**
 * One of their most popular songs still today and undeniably influential. 
* [One](https://youtu.be/5ncykvIuuns)
 * Wait for it...
* [Free Your Mind](https://youtu.be/OXKM4p7LdHs)

#### ""O""-...
""O"" was again, mostly the same formula that Korea was absolutely loving. Some people would probably be surprised that they hadn't changed concepts but you also have to remember that they were one of the handful of groups back then that were actually popular. 

* **[""O""-...](https://youtu.be/NWkS9S8QWm8)**
 * The foundation of the sound that made EXO popular initially!

#### Mirotic
Alright. The one everyone knows. DBSK's 4th album: Mirotic. Surprise! There is more than just the single on the album. :) 

* [Mirotic](https://youtu.be/HtJS32n6LNQ)
 * There is an [English version](https://youtu.be/NsZNwxxlIFc) by an artist named Sarah Connor
 * KBS found the song to be too sexually explicit, so they had to change the chorus to [""Under My Sky""](https://youtu.be/fFkJRFB7EPg?t=41)
* [Wrong Number](https://youtu.be/rwagNDrh1DA)
* [Crazy Love](https://youtu.be/WAhHoUFwT8o)

* [Rainbow](https://youtu.be/p2i6yXkiJjM) 
* [Are You a Good Girl](https://youtu.be/DSSegg5GEMY)

---

Split occurs. TVXQ! from here on out. 

---

#### Keep Your Head Down
Right off the bat we already get a departure from the sound we've gotten used to with DBSK. For the most part, we lose a lot of the power ballads that we've gotten used to but the singles tend to sound mostly like what DBSK established. Seeing as they're still with the same SM producers, songwriters, etc. 

* **[ (Keep Your Head Down)](https://youtu.be/djJb5iSL0Do)**

* [Rumor](https://youtu.be/ew739-bD5pM)
* [Athena](https://youtu.be/L3uCgtrZLEk)

Not the biggest fan of this album. To each their own. 

##### Before U Go (Repackage)
* [Before U Go](https://youtu.be/sIjZtzBoBbM)
* [Journey](https://youtu.be/chrN4HMyPko)

#### Catch Me
*Catch Me* is just SUCH a different song from their older stuff. Love the album though.

##### Humanoids (Repackage)
* [Humanoids](https://youtu.be/XAC5KRMyiQk)

#### Tense
*Something* is, again, so different from their other singles. Never done swing before. Whole album incorporates a lot of horns and swing instruments in general and blends them with electronics really well. 

* **[Something](https://youtu.be/U9HBT6sRSZ8)**

##### Spellbound (Repackage)
* [Spellbound](https://youtu.be/2rU_RZy2XhI)

#### Rise as God
Changing things up again. Departing the swing/big-band sound of Tense and going for a more raw(?) sound in Rise as God. Can definitely hear it in the first song on the album.

Some shower thoughts I've had:

* How many more ""new concepts"" exist? Will animal balloons become a concept? Because I'd be on board.

* What's ""retirement age"" for an idol?

* What do idol's do when they are not promoting? Especially smaller groups or ones with longer breaks. If they can't act or do make-up, do they get a ""normal job""? Do they not need another job?",43,32

* Idol School - girlband
* YG's Produce 101 - girlband and/or boyband
* YG's boyband survival - boyband
* Male SIXTEEN by JYP - boyband
* Final 99 Match = girlband AND boyband, this is also expected to be the most successful since it's going to air on a free public channel KBS (so the ratings will automatically be at least 3-4x higher than Produce 101 &amp; they got Rain to MC, potentially will also be more popular with international fans if they cast interesting contestants because KBS are fast with English subs + they'll surely upload the subbed version on Youtube)

Also, Idol School, 99 Match &amp; YG's Produce 101 will follow the same format: the winners will be determined by the audience.

We're getting a lot of survival show debuts this year, how do you feel about it?

The kind of performers who will have my jaw dropping to the floor and K-Pop features some incredible singers I've recently discovered. These are the ones I know about:

The marvelous Kim SonHyang. I am obsessed with her cover of **Bridge Over Troubled Water** and she even did a straightforward pop song like **Someday** which rocks. 

ALi is just breathtaking. There isn't a single Korean singer who sounds like her. With her deep voice and flawless Melisma, she's the kind of performer worth finding out. I've been looking for every song she's done and I wish there was more because her voice is a joy.

Ben has a voice like honey. Sweet, simple and it makes you melt and yet as soft as her voice is, the moment she starts to belt out, you're taken aback because you don't expect it. Fabulous singer. 

Lyn's voice is slightly thin yet her emotions come through in a way which I rarely see yet it is more impressive in an industry where singers aren't shy of expressing their emotions as they perform. Her voice is crystal clear and in ballads, you feel her heart break as she sings like an angel.

My opinion: 

Seventeen: Jeonghan, Woozi, and Vernon would have the best chance due to their visuals and personalities seeming to be popular with the audience. Coups, Hoshi, Mingyu have a good chance. And the rest probably depend on screentime (TBH the china line would likely go the way of Kenta RIP)

SHINee: Taemin would make it IMO. He's not SM's golden child for nothing. Jonghyun and Minho have a good chance. Onew... depends on screentime. Key... probably not. Mnet would evil edit him to death  ",43,29

This month's theme is ""**Collab Stages**""!

A collab stage is any live stage on a music show, awards show, or concert that features two or more artists from different groups or soloists.  They often feature songs that have only been performed once, or amazing arrangements that are truly unique and memorable.  Now is the time to share your favorite collab stages from years gone by that newer fans may not have ever seen, and older fans will love to remember.

In the spirit of TBT, the ""throwback"" element does have to be preserved. As such, submissions to the TBT should be **at least one year old**.

Throwback Album Discussions will return next week.  There is still time to [**VOTE HERE**](http://www.strawpoll.me/13311806) if you haven't yet.  The vote total is super close, so be sure to cast your ballot for which album you want to discuss next week!",34,33

I see fans say this all the time online. It's an idol's job to do what they do... They wanted to become an idol. And I'm pretty sure that people who sing/dance as their job have way more time off than they would if they had any other job.

I sent a post about Taemin's upcoming Korean solo concert in my Shawol group chat--thinking everyone would be excited--but the only responses I got were about SM not giving him enough time off. One person said ""They need to let him rest or I will sue."" Comments like this annoy me so much. The concert is almost 3 months from now and there's only 2 shows... Plus it's Taemin's dream to hold his own solo concert so he's probably super excited. Western artists go on tours that last months and no one says anything about them not getting enough sleep.

And like with Mark from NCT being in NCT 127 and NCT Dream... Is it really that much extra work... Some fans make it sound like being a kpop idol is the hardest and most time-consuming job out there.

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this topic...

Edit: According to this post (https://twitter.com/minhoshineeina/status/882820412664676354) Taemin has nothing scheduled from August 5 until August 26. And then after his concert on the 27th he has 5 more days until the next event. Idk how that's being overworked. ",10,0

Most of them certainly are flawed and the entertainment industry is very messy but opinions? 

For me I'd choose JYP because out of the big 3, it's the least evil in how I see it. I would go with the big3 bc of how I am, going through all those trainee and idol hardships and not having a good probability of recognition or success? :(( 
I'm not totally down with what it seems like a lot of control by JYP(CEO) w music but something similar to the day6 situation with having a bit more control w music is cool!! Plus realistically speaking, JYP seems relatively open to foreigners. 

Honorable mentions- fantiago and possibly bighit (though I'm not sure how well they might do with another idol group besides BTS).

Here are my favorites, feel free to share yours and why you like it/dislike it. 

**Group names that were not used, but were considered**

* Sistar - ""Diridiri Daradara Duruduru Bop"". I couldn't make that one up if I tried. 

* CLC - ""Gold Silver Jewelry Shop"". Y'all know it's my bias group gold silver jewelry shop!! This sounds so awkward to me lmao

* GFRIEND - ""WORLD CONQUEST"". I can't stop laughing at this one, someone told me this earlier so I'm not sure but even if it's wrong this is still funny.

* BTS - ""Big Kids"". While Bulletproof Boyscouts was cringy as hell and Beyond The Scene sounds super edgy, Big Kids is worse, in my opinion.

* BEAST - ""Gold Silver Bronze Bald Eagle"". What's with CUBE and trying to name their groups Gold Silver something? Lol.

* MAMAMOO - ""Wah Wah Girls"". I just can't imagine how their iconic introduction would go if they were named this.

* BLACKPINK - ""Pink Punk"". This isn't that bad to be honest but it's definitely not great and way too edgy for them lol

* VIXX - ""Bluefish"". N says he's so glad they didn't debut with this name and I completely agree.

* TVXQ - ""Whale That Eats Legends"". Seriously, who comes up with these?

**Stage names that were not used, but considered**

* Jungkook from BTS - ""Seagull"". Accurate tbh.

* Jimin from BTS - ""Baby G"". I can't. 

* Ravi from VIXX - ""Puki"". I don't know if this has a korean translation or something, but from an English speaker's perspective it's got to be either ""Pukey"" which is self-explanatory and bad, or ""pookie"" which is also bad.

**Group names**

* Weki Meki. I think we all agree this one is pretty bad, but I think it would sound better if it wasn't pronounced ""wicky micky"". But they're gonna bless us with those WEMES so we better embrace it.

* BTS - Bulletproof Boyscouts. The memes are great and we get used to the name after a while, but it's still cringey as fuck. And like I said earlier, beyond the scene isn't that much better.

* In general I find group names that include the member count awkward because usually someone leaves and it doesn't make sense. Like with 9muses, DAY6, etc. Pentagon confuses me because there's not 5 members. Seventeen made it work though lol.

**Stage Names**

* Rap Monster from BTS. I will never not cringe on this one, I'm sorry.  

I'll probably keep adding to this as I remember things because I'm drawing a blank and most of the ones I just google show up from BTS (unsurprisingly) but I'm sure you guys have a bunch to share too.",438,205

725,2017-07-07,2017,7,7,6,6loznh,Where do you think the industry is going to go in the future (i.e. 4th Generation)?,Glensather,1499376473,"It seems to me that the K-pop industry is kind of at a crossroads right now. The stuff coming out nowadays is a stark contrast to the way it was during the so-called ""Golden Age"" of 2009-2012

Concepts have remained largely the same for boys and girls, but many of them have some sort of twist, whether musically or visually. For example, GFriend musically would have slotted right in to that time, but their impressive dance moves would have left a lot of Gen-2 girl groups in the dust, being a cut above the standard dances that had been given to girl groups in the past. (GFriend is such a long way from Abracadabra's hip-swaying and Genie's leg... swing... kick... thing, that it can't even be in the same category.)

Retro has come back in a big way. There's always been retro-sounding tracks (See also T-Ara and several TVXQ songs), but the past few years have really amped it up. A lot of Mamamoo's tracks have a lot of influences from the 50s to the (very early) 80s, for example, but everyone from Ailee to IU, SNSD, and several others (if I listed them all I'd be here all day) have definitely been putting out retro vibes. Personally I love it.

Idols more now than ever seem to be in more control over the music they make. Although idols like GD have had a hand in their own music for several years now, other groups have really taken the whole idea to task. BTS and Seventeen in particular are basically leading a pack of idols who do everything from writing the songs to making up the choreography themselves.

In fact, the only people who are still stuck in the ""old ways"" seem to be the so-called ""Big 3"". SM, YG, and JYP still exert a lot of control over their idols, put together dances that are similar to what groups were doing six years ago, and give most of their singers little to no say in the songs they're given. And while sure, I don't say, ever see Nayeon putting together lyrics for Twice's next single, I think that a little creative muscle goes a long way, and idols should be at least given a chance to come up with songs on their own.

So this is the crossroads I'm talking about. On the one hand, you have older and more well-known agencies adopting a ""if it ain't broke"" formula and sticking with what's worked, with success. On the other hand, you have groups that have come from tiny agencies (and are often the flagship idols of that agency) showing up with fresh, new takes on old ideas, and giving their idols more creative freedom than most Big 3 agencies would dare to. And people are responding *very well* to these new changes.

It's been said before, but groups like BTS absolutely should not be as popular as they are. Everything in the K-pop industry goes against them. It's just simply not allowed because the established agencies are too ingrained into the system to ever have to play second fiddle in *any* aspect. But this is what's happening, and something is going to change because of it. I just don't know what, but I wouldn't be surprised at all to see 4th Generation boy groups take cues from BTS and 4th Generation girl groups learning complicated dances to mimic GFriend's choreography.

Another aspect is survival shows. Sixteen kicked off a trend that is only getting bigger (and as many would say, making everything worse). The immense popularity of the show (regardless of whether or not Twice was always or mostly going to be the lineup we ended up with) had a profound affect on K-pop, and out of the gate Twice had a popularity that many groups fail to achieve after being around for years. Produce 101 refined the formula to a needle point, and for a brief moment in time IOI was easily among the hottest girl groups (and, assuming the same thing happens, WannaOne will do the same to boy groups), despite being both temporary and essentially what amounts to a reality TV group. And now, with every channel putting together its own form of survival show, we can only expect this to continue going, at least for another couple of years. You have to wonder what's on the horizon now.

So why this wall of text? Because I wanna know what you all think of the future. Better or worse? No change?

Personally, I think things are going to get a lot better very fast. These small agencies have proven that they shouldn't be counted out just yet, and the *really* successful ones have taken the standard idol formula and played with it just enough to introduce some (relatively speaking) new, novel ideas to K-pop, and the public is responding.

So what about you? Is the future of K-pop a bright one? A hot mess?

Or is the death of the music one bad survival show away from collapsing in on itself? &lt;-- This sentence is hyperbole y'all.",59,56
726,2017-07-07,2017,7,7,6,6lozza,Do kpop groups talk informally among themselves?,dwabliam,1499376562,"Couldn't find a discussion about this. I know in BTS they apparently still talk formally to older members, and jungkook was asked before on idol party why he doesn't talk informally to the others. (He said the members told him he could at first, but he didn't back then. Yoongi then said he talks casually at home, and Jin and Taehyung said Jungkook's a little shit anyway even if he talks formally lmao)

But that got me wondering if other kpop groups talk informally among themselves openly on camera, not just at home? Also I've read things that say that whether one talks informally/formally to another isn't necessarily a sign of how close they are, is that true? ",20,56

825,2017-07-07,2017,7,7,22,6ltkax,[Fan Account] 170704 SBS MTV The Show,Lemontea22,1499433277,"After missing out opportunities to see some idols in Japan (see 1. in footnotes), I was looking forward to watching a music show in Korea. I dont identify to any particular fandom, so decided to go with the easiest option to watch music shows: by buying a ticket. Since SBS The Show fitted better with the schedule compared to MNet Countdown, I went with that.

*Proof:* 
[The worst photo of APink ever] (http://imgur.com/a/sTngM)
[NC.A snap] (https://streamable.com/0zvun)

I had already visited the Digital Media Center the day prior to this recording and saw SNSDs Yoona and Im Siwan (thats another story in itself) so it was easy to get to the building. While waiting for the scheduled time to enter and after chatting to other fans (2.), we heard a loud cheer: NC.A came out to greet us! She was adorable.  Later, we would also see UP10TION and 24K (3.). Also saw P.O taking photos with fans outside the building.

We had seats that were near the middle of the audience stand. As we sat down, P.O, Junghwa and Yeonwoo got on the little platform in front of the stage and did a rehearsal. With no staff directions to the audience, it was hard to tell when the show was on/off, but the TVs showing the SBS channel nearby did help.  

You can catch all the performances linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/music-shows/the-show/20170704).

Its too boring to do play-by-play, but here are some notes:

*	The MCs were really good with fan interaction  the live fan interview aside, P.O occasionally came up to the audience and interacted with us. He even took a selfie with one of the fans in the back row and patted his/her hair (jealous af). Yeonwoo and Junghwa interacted with the fans in the front row a lot  maybe they were regulars?
*	Junghwa is really pretty in person. I like EXID but have always focused on Hani and Solji  but man I am sold on Junghwa. During one of the intermissions, she looked up to the audience and being an awkward potato, with a blank face I waved at her while keeping eye contact. She smiled shyly and I died from cuteness
*	The guy group dances really impressed me  VAV, A.C.E, 24K all had really good choreography  the power and precision is something not really captured from watching the performances on YouTube
*	Tropical house everywhere
*	No NCT 127 (4.) or Kim Tae-Woo 
*	Because of that, this show was headlined by girl groups  Nine Muses, Stellar, Mamamoo and APink which hey, works for me. With the exception of Mamamoo, they all did one verse as the stages were pre-recorded
*	Nine Muses - We all know about Kyungri but it should be noted that Sojin is really pretty in person
*	Mamamoo  Charisma abound. People talk about stage presence with them and man, do they own it
*	APink  Naeun is as pretty as advertised. Hayoung knew the fan chants and was mouthing it when it wasnt her time to sing haha (1-2-3-4-FIVE!)
*	Pink Panda and MooMoo were well represented both in the moshpit and the audience stand
*	One friendly reminder to not have your phone out during the recording - *Just dont do it*
*	Like everyone else, I have no idea what APink was doing during the encore stage.

It was a good experience for me and if you are a general k-pop fan wanting to experience how a live show is recorded, I would recommend The Show since its on a smaller scale and is very tourist friendly. 

Footnotes:

1.	Missed out on Twice while they were doing the tour around Shibuya and the SGC concert in Yokohama (featuring Rain, Se7en, Block B, Highlight and EXID) was cancelled 3 days prior to the event
2.	Kpop does really connect people  to the sassy NCT fangirl, I like your style
3.	Apparently one guy from 24K was staring into my camera the whole time  I have yet to identify the member to stan
4.	By accident, I queued up for NCT 127s pre-recordings waiting list reveal.  As I left SBS the previous day, I noticed a group of girls waiting for something. Huh, must be a guy group coming was my thinking. So I waited for an hour for a piece of paper with a number I cannot call. Although the girls taking selfies every 10-15 minutes should have been a clear enough hint

901,2017-07-08,2017,7,8,15,6lzm9l,"170707 SuperPopConPH2017 (B1A4, BAP, BTOB, Pentagon, VIXX, B.I.G, Kriesha Chu)",seitengrat,1499496958,"So I attended my first Kpop concert ever since becoming a Kpop fan this year. I've been a casual Kpop listener since 2009, but I really didn't get into it until late Feb/early March this year. So when I heard my bias group was going to Manila I bought a ticket pronto! I went alone and sat in the lower box section.

First up, **Pentagon**. They sang four songs, Can You Feel It?, Pretty Pretty, Beautiful and Critical Beauty. I'm not 100% really into Pentagon but I appreciate Hui's and Jinho's vocals!! Dang, boys can sing. I never knew Hongseok speaks great English? EDawn dances like there's no tomorrow. Yuto sounds so amazing and his looks, those are gonna kill. This group's visuals are topnotch.

Next up was the reason why I attended this concert. **BTOB**!! GOODNESS. Didn't expect them to come out so early. They sang I'll Be Your Man, 2nd Confession, It's Okay, Someday and MOVIE. They sound so good live. I was screaming my heart out. I did the It's Okay fanchant correctly and I was dead as it was my favorite song. I love it. They dedicated It's Okay to the victims of an earthquake that happened a day earlier (ugh so thoughtful I'm crying) and they were making eye contacts with Melodies around the hall.  And the spotlight is on Peniel. I like that he really becomes front and center when they go to a majorly English-speaking country. GO GET THEM PEUNI. I'm getting chills just recollecting the 20 minutes they had on stage. I even lost my shit when they said they wanted to come back for a solo concert. PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN CUBE. 

Third up was **VIXX**. I started to know them from Shangri La. But wow?? Those moves?? and the VOCALS ARE GOOD too. I now understand why they are called concept kings.. You can really see the concept in their moves per song. They all tried to speak in Tagalog. So adorable. N was handsome, his skin stands out so much, he can pass as a Filipino lmao! And Leo! He is so fair-skinned it's unreal (the contrast is amazing haha)! OMG. I heard the last time they were here they were only 5 so last night was a blessing to Starlights coz they finally saw Fantasy with OT6. They also sang On and On and Love Equation! I love the choreo of On and On @_@ how unique could it be?

Fourth up was **Kriesha Chu**. She is cute AF and has the voice and the moves. Crowd was silent during her performance but when she did her ment the crowd chanted her name! Gotta love these attendees. She sang Trouble, a local song and another one which I don't know the title of. I didn't expect her pronunciation to be so good tbh, so she singing a local song is a surprise for me. She needs more work on her ment, I don't know if she is just naturally quiet or she was just exhausted :( She has lots of potential and I can see her placing in the charts in the future. 

Next up is **B1A4**. BANAs went wild for this one. These boys really know how to work a crowd. Baro damn. You so cool. Jinyoung how can you be so cute??? I love everyone. Dis group so visually stunning. Stage presence is also fcking amazing. Baby Good Night, A Lie and What's Going On are bops. BANAs are so lucky coz it's been a while since the boys came back and folks, the boys delivered. Bigtime. Gaaaah. The fanchants were solid, best of the night tbh.

Then **BIG** followed up. I don't know much about this group, I didn't like their ment coz the subject made me cringe, but I think they did okay in their performance as well.

Final group was **BAP**. I love Wake Me Up. They also sang One Shot and No Mercy. AND THE WHISTLES. They're everywhere. and Daehyun's high note in No Mercy shocked me o__O and Jongup's dance break made my jaw drop. I really didn't expect that!

Attending my first kpop concert was a great experiencece! It feels really awesome to see your faves live. I just think it was a wrong decision to go alone and seated away from my main fandom haha. 10/10 would do it again :D Thanks for reading.

This is the first place I've found online for k-pop fans that are 'normal'. By that I mean I don't see much 'omg oppar omo omo my husband kill yourself if you don't worship his every pore etc etc'. And I don't mean to shit on k-pop fans everywhere, but I really like how people are pretty positive here too and when they aren't a fan of something, they either don't comment or just say they don't like it. It's not 'I'm a Sone so I hate this and this group should eat shit and die'. 

It's almost like the people on here aren't all 12 and the 12 year olds that are here aren't horrible like I was at that age losing my shit over TVXQ dating rumors. 

Plus, y'all get the news so fast. I see everything on here hours before it's on allkpop or soompi. 

So shout out to the mods and to everybody in the community. ",132,474

I personally think DSP is doing a killer job with KARD. They're a relatively new group with a pretty large international presence. And I think DSP realized this. Such extensive US/SA touring is basically unheard of in the kpop industry. And I'll bet that financially it'll pay off. 

As for poorly, I'd have to say RV, they're a very well rounded group who is basically getting the f(x) treatment. Maybe I don't follow them closely enough, but I don't hear or see much about the members outside of their promotions. ",19,49

1016,2017-07-09,2017,7,9,18,6m6o66,"Feel Korea in London fan account (KNK, SNUPER, EXID, Highlight) 08/07/2017",professorgenkii,1499593747,"This is my account of last night's event at the Kensington Olympia. This event was split into two parts, there was a convention-style event during the day and then a concert in the evening. 

The convention-style event had stalls from the Korean tourist organisations, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and some traditional arts and crafts stuff. The main area had [fake grass and deck chairs ](https://m.imgur.com/FYoyhZ3) and they had performers. There was a dance/song contest of which [Seungjun and Jihun from KNK](https://m.imgur.com/vg0oUm8) were judges. They were sat in the middle of the crowd and it was chaos. 

When we were queueing up for the show EXID were hanging out in the dressing room above the queue and [Junghwa ](http://m.imgur.com/FZRrSQx) was getting everyone to chant  at her and the other members. Hani was MCing with these 2 English guys for the concert. Idk who they were and one of them was chewing gum onstage(?!?) but Hani's English was really impressive. 

KNK came on first and sang Knock, Sun and Moon, U and Back Again. They looked really smart in matching blue suits but we are in London and it's currently humid af and the Olympia doesn't have air conditioning so everyone was super hot. KNK were really good though, and their English was really sweet. 

Hyelim from EXID then did a special solo stage, which was dedicated to the UK after all the shit that's been going down recently. She sang You Raise Me Up and it was fantastic, her vocals were on point and her pronunciation was pretty decent. 

Snuper were next. I know nothing about these guys but I quite liked them. Their sound was a little bit old school but they were really good performers. They got a girl up onstage and serenaded her for one of the songs and one of the guys managed  to get a Union Jack signed by Snuper fans and he was wearing it as a cape.  

EXID were on next and they sang Hot Pink, Night Rather Than Day, a third song I'm having a complete mental blank on and Up and Down. LE and Hani interacted with the crowd a lot and Hani got us to do a hand movement for Up and Down. They wore their outfits from the Night Rather Than Day promotions but it was pretty hot in those blazers. They were my favourite act of the night, Hyelim nailed all her high notes and they just looked like they were really happy to be there (especially Hani). 

There was then a collaboration stage between LOKO (a London based kpop dance group) and Snuper. They performed BTS's Danger, Fire and Not Today and it was awesome, everybody was so hyped. 

Highlight were on last and they sang Plz Don't Make Me Sad, another song I didn't know and then they sang Good Luck and Yey. I didn't know they were allowed to perform Beast songs so this was a real surprise and I was obsessed with Good Luck when it came out so it was really cool to hear it. Their stage outfits were really weird though, they wore these frilly shirts and blazers and they must have been so hot. 

There was then an encore where Highlight sang another song I didn't know and all the acts came onstage. There were these [big balloons](http://m.imgur.com/NHCypdu)filled with confetti bouncing around and Hani was running away from them because she's scared of balloons (I can really relate). Some of the group members had these hands on sticks that were popping the balloons, it was so bizarre. There was [more confetti] as Highlight finished (http://m.imgur.com/KoFessq) and then the concert ended. 

I went to Kcon in Paris last year that had 12,000 people attending, whereas this had 5,000 people. It was interesting to see the differences between the two but the London event was definitely better organised overall. I hope this event comes back to London (I think it was here in 2015?) because it was really good fun. ",27,102

1026,2017-07-09,2017,7,9,23,6m7qpr,170708 SMTOWN VI Live in Seoul,jolaurence,1499610928,"So I survived SMTOWN. I did global package for this because I sure was hell was not gonna miss this SMTOWN. It was the first SMTOWN in Seoul since 2014. I was not gonna miss this. Hence, the global package. I started saving up for it when I heard rumblings about the concert. I did Deluxe 1 for this but I decided on stand seats instead of ground for various reasons. I got to my hotel around 11 pm after work Friday and settled in. I wasnt able to pick up my stuff until Saturday. But the bed. SO COMFY! Also, loved how big the bathroom was. Ive been to way too many hotels in my short time on Earth but I loved the bathroom. 

On Saturday morning after I had my coffee, I headed downstairs and got in line to pick up my stuff. They picked out my seat for me and it was a great seat. A blessing seat really. I went upstairs to take pictures of what I got. [Here are all of the souvenirs]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DELLpTCUwAAooO9.jpg). And then [here was my merch preorder](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DELLpTCU0AAS8gj.jpg). I am a trash heap. [I then got my bag ready for the day](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DELQHkDV0AEPuYn.jpg).Again, a trash heap. I went down around 11:00 and found out my meeting time was changed to noon. So I decided to look at the map and ah. My seat. I was gonna be right next to the second stage.

I ended up talking to a Taemint who went to his concert in Japan the week before and we discussed the whole Korea solo concert mess. Then we gathered with our group and got on our bus. We had lunch at SMT Seoul and I asked if it was okay if I ditched the group after lunch to go to the venue myself and then take the bus back. She said it was okay. We were going to the Artium anyway, which was gonna be busy and I was right. Plus our event was watching one of the hologram concerts. I had fangoods to find. I went to the Artium with my bus and then waited for a friend who was coming with her package. The two of us then headed over to the venue to find fansite goods. We were pretty unlucky since most of them ended by the time we got there but we did get [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEMmK_sUwAAIMex.jpg) from a Jaeyong site.  I also ran into u/ravingphantic as well finally. I also briefly met up with two of my friends from Twitter as well. Plus, I ran into one of the few NCTzens I know from prerecs who also is a fansite but Im still not sure for what site. The friend I was with and I both needed to go to the bathroom and we knew going to it at the venue would be a bad idea so we just took the train over one station and went there. Genius idea. We then headed back and found our spots since she was on the ground and I was in the stands.

I had another NCTzen friend there as well and her seat was the row behind me. [This](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEMylR8VoAEzKaR.jpg) was my [view](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEMylR9VwAEbMLB.jpg). I literally fell on the ground when I saw it. I sent the pictures to a few friends and they pretty much all wished me luck. I got my [lightsticks](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEMyx4kU0AcmS_R.jpg) out and got ready for my doom. Before the concert started, they were having fans do a duet with various SM artists using that singing app. That was a lot of fun. 

Since this was basically all of SM performing in various capacities, Im gonna write about each group separately as well as the VCRs.  I cant remember the concert order even though I have the list on my phone. Im also gonna write about what my section by the stage saw. Some of the sections will be shorter than others I apologize.  Also, we should all know what will be the longest section. Starts with N, ends with T, and in the middle is a C. Sorry not sorry. 

**The VCRs:**

There were 3 of them. The first one was super light and happy looking. This VCR meant that the first set of the concert was gonna be happier songs. I screamed so much whenever I saw NCT on there. But Mark. MY BOY! He had his own section of it since he probably filmed it when he had time.  He looked so good. The second VCR was much darker. I lost it when I saw Yunho just like the lady next to me. But NCT. Oh my god. Sleeveless Johnny, Yuta serving looks, and Jaeyong in 4 seconds. I HAD NO TIME TO BREATHE. This VCR meant that the set list was gonna be a lot darker in ways since it was very futuristic and edgy. The last VCR was a mixture of the first two VCRs meaning that the last set of the concert was gonna be happy and edgy. 

**My stage:** 

My stage got blessed with having Chanyeol and Wendy performing Stay With Me, Heechul and Baekhyun doing Sweet Dream, Super Junior singing Magic, and Red Velvet performing Rookie. So heres my [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DENCYTOUQAAlZNw.jpg) of Wendy and Chanyeol. How am I even alive seeing both my Red Velvet bias and my EXO co-bias in front of me? HOW AM I EVEN ALIVE? But wait. WAIT. During Sweet Dream, Baekhyun looked at me. GOOD BYE WORLD. I GOT LOOKED AT BY BAEKHYUN. I wish more artists went to my stage but its okay. It was a really chill section as well. 

**BoA:**

So I have been a BoA fan since 2005 when my sister got me into anime. She is a goddamn queen. She slayed all of her choreos. Camo is such a good song. That choreo is so hot. But Only One with Sehun. OH SEHUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She slayed. 

**Kangta:**

The Original Oppa and my H.O.T bias. His voice is so good. Just so, so good. 

**Henry:**

Henry did his song with Mark and it was really good. You go Henry. You go. I really enjoy Henrys style of music and I hope SM stops being crappy towards him but then again, he had to perform separate from the rest of Super Junior because of various reasons. Im too lazy to even discuss this because then I have to talk about the history of Super Junior and thats already super long. Only 13s I swear. 

**Luna:**

FREE SOMEBODY IS A JAM AND IT DESERVES MORE LOVE. IT DESERVES AWARDS. JUSTICE FOR FREE SOMEBODY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, JUSTICE FOR f(x). 

Sorry. Had to all caps. Carrying on.

**Hyo:**

Queen. That sums it up. Just. Queen. No words but Queen. AND TAEYONG DOING THAT SOLO. MY BOY KILLED IT. 

**Super Junior:**

Lets discuss Super Junior. SuJu has had a very long week because of K-ELFS. Their section was so small compared to what it would have been. I applaud the members for putting on a great performance. Shindong has his special stage and it was so good. Heechul sang Sweet Dream which literally stayed in the charts forever. Then the members of the group performed Sorry Sorry which was so lit. Then they had their ment and Yesung was on the verge of tears. I wanted to run to the stage and hug them. [I do have my own personal feelings about Leeteuk but they are my own feelings so I wont share them] To the ELFs there supporting, I love you so much. Thank you for truly living up to your fandom name. Also, SuJu used the carts to come over to the second stage and they were so great. You go SuJu and I will support you for your comeback. Also, thanks for taking care of the Dreamies.

**Taeyeon:**

MY VOCAL QUEEN COMING TO SLAY ALL OF YALL FAVES. MY VOCAL QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ive seen her perform before so I knew she would be so good. And she was.

**Tiffany:**

Just Want to Dance is a jam. I cant wait until she has a comeback again because I know it will be good. Her songs are so fun to sing along to as well. 


**SNSD:**

Finally. After 5 years of being a fan, I was seeing my girls. I was so ready to see them. AND THEY WERE SO GOOD! MY ANGEL AND MY GIRLS! MY SUNSHINE! I finally got to see my female UB, Yoona. FINALLY. Shes just so cute and wonderful and I love her so much. I was singing along and just jamming to all of their songs. They were just so good. Im so excited for their comeback. I was just going off the entire time.

**Red Velvet:**

THESE GIRLS! I call them my princesses since I consider Soshi my queens. They were just so good. Irene and Seulgi with their special stage killed it. And Wendy killed it singing Stay With Me. Ive been a fan of the girls since they were Rookies and its been amazing seeing how much they have grown over the years. They are all so talented. Its clear to why all of their seniors just dote on them. Their new song was so good live. I loved it. Red Velvet, my wonderful princesses, I love you so much. So, so much. Also, the fanchants were so loud.

**Yunho:**

Brace yourself. God has returned. The lady next to me was a major Tohoshinki fan. She had her T and everything. It was amazing seeing on the ground the amount of red that turned on all of a sudden. There was just this feeling in the air. The Cassies in the fan section were on their feet. Fans on the ground were holding their Ts high. And that opening VCR for Yunho made the place scream. Finally. He was returning to us after so long. The moment his new song, Drop began, I was literally transported to the world of U-Know Yunho. I didnt even realize his pants had ripped. I was just so transfixed by how he controlled the audience. He truly is a king.

He left to get new pants and then came out and Mirotic happened and I just went off. ITS MIROTIC. ICONIC SONG IS ICONIC. Everyone was doing the fanchant. The two EXO-Ls in front of me were very confused to why everyone was singing along. Because girls. Because this is the song that your oppas know from a group your oppas look up to. When it was time for Keep Your Head Down the lady next to me was doing the motions like I was and her T bumped the girl in front of her and she glared. Lady kept going at it with the T.  Youre supposed to have your lightstick go down. Its part of the fanchant. WHEN YUNHO TELLS YOU TO KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, YOU DO AS HE SAYS. 

Im just so ready for the TVXQ comeback. Just so ready. Cassies are ready. The world is ready. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO.

**EXO:**

Every time EXO or CBX or an EXO member did something, the place turned into an EXO concert. I swear. The screams were so loud. I mean, I screamed so loud when Chanyeol was by me. Same with Baekhyun. There were so many EXO lightsticks. The screams. My ears hurt so bad. It became very entertaining watching security try to make EXO-Ls and fansites sit down and then they gave up. EXO was so good though. They are always so good. It was only my second time seeing them. One day I will see EXO as 9. Lay, I miss you so much. Also, is Kai even real? Is he real????? I dont even know. But hearing Machine OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY 2012 SELF WAS DEAD. And when the teaser dropped for the comeback, everyone just lost it. Lost it. Were living in EXOs world really. 

**SHINee:**

I LOVE THESE 5 DORKS SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was laughing so hard during their ment that my face was hurting. And it was clear that they were talking just to the Shawols as usual but I love that about them. They just love Shawols so much and the Shawols just shower them back with that love. Taemin and Jonghyun had solo stages and the fanchants for both. The Shawol section was on the third floor and it was so bright and loud. Apparently they went so hard that the floor was shaking. OF COURSE IT WAS! Shawols just go all out. Jonghyun singing the rap in Deja Boo makes me so hyped. Rap God Kim Jonghyun. 
There were so many Shawols in the audience. Those Shabats are so bright. I saw fans use them as guide beacons after the concert. During their ment, they mentioned that Obama talked about them and we all screamed. I had to shout Thats my president. Look. Obama is a Shawol. Hes a total Shawol. 

I just love how SHINee performs. Their presence is just so amazing. I got so emotional when they did Replay because that song just tugs at my heart. And Sherlock. I went off. Same with Everybody. Plus when they did EDM version of Lucifer which is always so good. I love that song so much. And then we have the jam that is View. Everyone was singing along to it. I JUST LOVE SHINEE SO MUCH THEY MAKE SO HAPPY. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. 

**NCT:**

MY BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The boys in general were in such a great mood since the day before was 127s anniversary. On Thursday they had a fan meeting. Saturday they had to do MuCore still but they were in a great mood. So from the fan accounts of the prerec on twitter, I knew it was gonna be a great time seeing them. First, lets talk about Mr. Absolutely Fully Capable. Mark Lee, my busy little man. He had his collab with Henry. He had his collab with certified NCTzen and Mark Fanboy, Parc Jaejung. He had his collab with Xiumin, which is so good and everyone should stream it. He performed in all 3 NCT units. MY BOY WAS BUSY. Everytime he went on stage, so many people screamed for him. Mark is so nice though. During his collab with PJJ, the camera went to Lee Sooman and the CEO of Mystic and the look of Lee Soomans face. Yup. Thats his rising star and second ace of the company right there. 

Second, Lee Taeyong. His rap when he went on for Hyos stage was straight up fire. Taeyongs rap is really good. Im waiting for that full studio version of Open the Door so bad. 

Third, DOYOUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! His little collab was so good because his voice is that of an angel. An actual angel. His brother came to support him and a fansite or a fan caught him crying. Im fine. Kim brother feelings.

Also, the Rookies [SR17B] and some unknown trainees were spotted as well. They were two sections away from me Im pretty sure but they were holding NCT lightsticks.
Speaking of that, there were so many NCTzens in the audience. There were so many on the ground but from what I heard they were being pretty unruly by standing up a lot and on the chairs. A big no-no really. Those in the stands were great though. Didnt stand at all. But the fanchants over in the official NCTzen section were so loud. You could audibly hear them. Especially Limitless. I think in general we just go off when they perform Limitless.

The first NCT unit that performed was Dream and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I havent seen them perform since March and they were so good. They have grown since that time as well. Theyre almost a year old as of next month but I am just so proud of them. I cant wait until they have a comeback. Im not ready to say goodbye to NCT Dream Mark yet though. Not ready at all. Also, Jaemin, I miss you so much. I know there were fans disappointed to not see him there, but until SM releases an update about his status, he wont be with Dream yet. 

The second NCT unit to perform was U and it was my first time seeing them perform. They were dressed for Limitless and Ten was in a different section. The screams when Ten came out. THE SCREAMS. After all these years. TEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every Ten stan that I knew there was a mess. Twitter was a mess too. Everything was a mess. It was brief but it felt so good to see him perform.

After The 7th Sense, all of NCT came out to greet the crowd. All 14 of them. Those are my boys. I screamed so loud for Johnny. The kids looks so cute. I was squealing when Jisung and Chenle introduced themselves. Im such a proud mom for them. After their little ment, 127 did Limitless and I just went off. Limitless era has a special place in my heart because that was when I joined the fandom full time. I was screaming the fanchant at the top of my lungs. 

The boys came back during the EDM section and did Firetruck IN THEIR FIRETRUCK OUTFITS. I SCREAMED SO LOUD. Its been forever since we saw them wear those outfits and it made me really emotional since Friday was the debut anniversary. The last song they performed was Cherry Bomb and that song still makes me exhausted. We started chanting NCT as we waited for them to perform. I was the only one in my section during the fan chant but I could kinda hear the NCTzens in the stand. That song. SO deadly. BUT SO GOOD. I was just really proud of NCT the entire night and I pretty much confirmed the fact that I need a solo concert from them soon. 

**Ending song:** 

This song is one that gets me kinda emotional because you see all the artists onstage singing and interacting with each other plus the fans. SHINee went wild when they saw the Shawols and the Shawols were going wild. NCT was so cute and adorable. They were waving to everyone. And Taeyong was at peak puppy stage. He was supposed to sing with but didnt have a mic so he looked around and was like What do I do??? Staff rushed to give him a mic and he ended up with two. Johnny and Taeil were hyping him up. Taeyong gave one of the extra mics to Taeil. 2Tae! Suho got so hyped while waving that he bumped into Doyoung at the end for the bows. All of SMTOWN did their bows and kept saying goodbye. Taeyong ended up gathering NCT and they did a separate bow. 

The concert ended and we all headed out of the venue to get to where we needed to go. I needed to go to my bus to head back to the hotel. I found my bus and with global package you get a snack so I ate that since I was hungry. We left when everyone on my bus arrived and we headed out. As we were leaving, I saw that Shawols were getting on busses. Sometimes Shawols will organize busses for people who live out of town for events that SHINee will be performing at. I LOVE SHAWOLS SO MUCH. 

I got back to the hotel around midnight and I was exhausted. SMTOWN was exhausting but worth it. It was so much fun and I would go again. Maybe be in the NCTzen section so I can be with my people but maybe global package again.

I have quite a few favorites. 
The first shot that comes to mind is Bermuda Triangle's [church scene](https://youtu.be/ZHoLaLlL5lA?t=133). I just thought the background was beautiful and the boys centered in the middle was great. Especially when all three are together. 
The second is Bang x3. Now I have two favorites in this MV. The first is the whole [tunnel scene](https://youtu.be/2ips2mM7Zqw) with Taeyang in the beginning and the crazy [group dance scene](https://youtu.be/2ips2mM7Zqw?t=198) at the end with all the shit happening in the background is fantastic imo.
The third is Dumb Dumb. Now I loved a lot of the ""clone"" scenes but the [robotic dance scene](https://youtu.be/XGdbaEDVWp0?t=158) has to be my favorite because I love the dance + the cute outfits lol. Honestly this whole MV was a blessing.

This is what I can think of so far. What are some of your favorites?",46,62

This was inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/657ebf/art_direction_in_kpop/) but instead of discussing overall art direction I'm interested in specifically seeing what others think are good graphic design in Kpop. It could be anything from album packaging to promo posters or even font styles used that you really like.

 **Please link some images if possible!**

*Here's a few that I really liked:*

* [**EXO - EX'ACT :**](http://i.imgur.com/27iAahR.jpg) I really dig the minimalist design and the different ways they incorporated EXO's logo.

* [**MAMAMOO - Purple :**](https://i0.wp.com/www.kpopscene.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mamamoo-purple-5th-mini-album.jpg?fit=720%2C720) Eye pleasing shapes and colour choices, I also really like the font styling for *""MAMAMOO""*.

* [**Red Velvet - Ice Cream Cake :**](https://youtu.be/glXgSSOKlls?t=3m18s) The motion graphic near the end at 3:18 I think was very crafty.

* [**Pink Tape - f(x) :**](https://functionlove.net/2013/08/03/hq-scanstrans-fx-2nd-album-pink-tape-photocards-messages/) Loved the packaging as a whole especially the little character design representing each members.

EDIT: Fixed some mistakes and added more examples.

Last Tuesday I announced /r/kpop Top Ten Tuesdays and asked /r/kpop to vote on which artists that it wants to see featured in this series. 224 ballots were submitted and 184 artists were nominated. 

The 25 artists that received the most points will be featured over the next 25 weeks followed by /r/kpop's Top Ten Songs of 2017. (I initially said 16 but this way it lasts exactly 6 months.)  I also decided to do a ""Live Reveal Thread"" to add a little more tension and suspense (hopefully). I'll reveal the bottom 84 in 30min and then do reveals every 5min. In the meantime, I'll start a top 25 prediction thread. Whoever guesses the most correct will be gilded, the number of exact placements will decide tie breakers. 

July 11th: Red Velvet (719 points)

July 18th: SNSD (701 points)

I'm not a singer, so I have pretty much no clue what proper technique sounds like. From what I've gleaned from reading the other thread was that vocal color and vocal range don't have too much to do with it. Like, someone can reach a really high note and have a vocal color I like, but still be damaging their voice.

For those who are classically trained singers or know more about the topic, who are examples of singers with good technique? And what about their technique is good? I want to take a listen to the ""best"" and the ""worst"" to see if I can distinguish what others have been saying.",36,23

I've loved both of the Red Velvet EPs this year, but I've been waiting for an LP as good as The Red was - so I figured why not take both releases and edit them into one myself? Here's the [Red Summer LP](https://open.spotify.com/user/mokimbird/playlist/0OlpYXWeXVQu8hqHIzMHFu), if you're interested in the end result..

It was fun to think about how to sequence these tracks and to make them sound like a cohesive whole: interestingly, the Red Summer tracks ended up in the same order, while the Rookie tracks needed some reordering. I was thinking about how to balance the more red tracks with the more velvet tracks, while still putting together songs that worked well in sequence (Mojito/Talk To Me was a fun pair to match, and I also ended up loving the choice of putting Rookie right in the middle, as it's so unique that it sort of splits the front and back half of the LP).

That process got me thinking, though, about other artists who haven't had many LPs, and I wanted to ask who else in this sub has done this with their favorite artists and some of their EPs/smaller releases! Did it end up working well/sounding like it could have plausibly been a cohesive album, or were the different EPs too different in sound to put together? I remember one time I edited all of Nine Muses' singles up to 2015 into a nine-track LP...fun times.

Also, if anybody's curious, here's the order I ended up settling on:

**Red Velvet - The Red Summer LP (2017)**

1. Red Flavor (Red Summer)

2. You Better Know (Red Summer)

3. Little Little (Rookie)

4. Zoo (Red Summer)

5. Happily Ever After (Rookie)

6. Rookie (Rookie)

7. Mojito (Red Summer)

8. Talk To Me (Rookie)

9. Hear The Sea (Red Summer)

10. Body Talk (Rookie)

11. Last Love (Rookie)",5,34

I remember that I got hooked because of the unique sound that was Kpop then. Super Junior, SNSD, KARA, Big Bang, Wonder Girls were just some of the groups that were really big. 

As we all witnessed, the Kpop wave has progressively swept worldwide, and in keeping up, the trends has mostly adapted western influence, as we saw a few years ago when EDM dominated majority of the songs. I specifically remember SM going nuts with the EDM concept. 

Recently, the tropical house, reggaeton, dancehall genre is the in thing right now. The adaptation to other genres or styles is a welcome change as it allows the groups or artists to showcase other parts of their musicality and their range. As i've mentioned, the recent tropical house, and EDM vibe has resonated well with me which has dug me deeper into the Kpop world of which I don't think I will ever get out of. I've discovered new groups, old groups, other K-genres, and I am glad. 

What do you think the next musical trend will be? Or what style would you like to see your group try?",78,83

Now, it boasts 2.8942 billion views with a current average [1 million views per](http://kworb.net/youtube/topvideos.html) day. However, Wiz Khalifa's Furious 7 Soundtrack [""See You Again (feat. Charlie Puth)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk) has just surpassed this number, now with 2.8946 billion views, averaging 3 million views per day. Additionally, Luis Fonsi's music video [""Despacito (feat. Daddy Yankee)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk) is climbing up the ranks quickly.

&gt; From Sports Chosun via Nate:

&gt; 1. [+306, -8] Wow, the record still hadn't been broken? That makes it feel more amazing...  

&gt; 2. [+279, -8] Wow, it hadn't been broken for 5 years? That really is amazing

&gt; 3. [+195, -8] I hope Psy keeps up his own style instead of focusing on 'Gangnam Style' 

&gt; 4. [+18, -3] Psy, please focus on your music with less pressure now  it's sad that he seems to be focusing on songs like this under the pressure

&gt; From Naver:

&gt; 1. [+289, -12] It's amazing that Psy has been #1 for this long, what's up with the Psy hate in the comments?? Psy fighting~!!

&gt; 2. [+140, -6] There is no #1 that lasts forever

&gt; 3. [+87, -3] 'See You Again' is a good song

&gt; 4. [+94, -7] It's such a meaningful song, it can't be helped

&gt; 5. [+34, -3] Isn't 'See You Again' a damn good song though? It makes me think of Paul Walker too  dammit

&gt; 6. [+16, -0] Amazing that 'Gangnam Style' was #1 for over four years. 'See You Again' is a meaningful song in its own right as well.

&gt; 7. [+10, -0] Amazing for how long it was #1, amazing to think of the profits he made ",99,332

1264,2017-07-11,2017,7,11,13,6mjyqw,Kpop Artists with the Most Number of Weeks in the Top 10 on GAON since Jan. 2016 &amp; Analysis,twikstephen,1499747603,"Awhile ago, I saw posted on this subreddit a list of [""Boy group songs that spent the most number of weeks on Melon Top 10 (2006 - 2017)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6gq3fl/boy_group_songs_that_spent_the_most_number_of/).

I was shocked by people including the OP making multiple highly upvoted statements saying things like 

&gt; ""I dont think BTS songs have long longevity on the top 10

&gt; ""BTS dont do really well digitally, just fandom.

&gt; ""They dont have any big hits in Korea, no public recognition, and most of their fan base is international so its not too surprising. 

I realized that a lot of people didn't seem to understand the Korean Kpop landscape. So, I went through the last year and half of the GAON chart (June 2017 to Jan 2016) to find the data to better explain just how wrong those statements are.

* Why the GAON chart and not Melon? The GAON chart is the official chart for South Korea, similar to the American Billboard chart. I used the Digital Chart which includes data from downloads, streaming, and background music. This chart is a much better representation of the overall Korean landscape than just the Melon chart.

* The data might not be perfect. I may have made tiny mistakes here and there with counting. I had to go week by week and write down each top 10 and then count them up. By the 50th week, I was going a little autopilot-y. Please let me know if I did something wrong, and I will edit it. I don't believe it should affect the general points though.

* I stopped checking the chart in June because that's when I originally wanted to post this. 

I separated the longest charting songs into 6 categories: Girl Groups, Boy Groups, OST songs, Duo/Groups, Solo Male, and Solo Female.

-----

* Boy Groups are less popular in Korea than most international fans think

There is a HUGE difference in the number of weeks boy group songs have charted when compared to every other category. The gap was actually a lot bigger than I expected. Aside from Winners Really Really, there were 36 songs before you even get to another boy group. 36!
 Which btw should put in perspective how insanely well that song did.

This is important because its not that BTS doesnt have longevity in the top 10 or that they dont do well digitally, its that the ENTIRE CATEGORY of boy groups dont really have any longevity or do well digitally. Just getting to 2 - 3 weeks puts you at the very top of the boy group ladder. 

Also, of the boy groups that made the list. Most of them are older. Of the 15 boy group songs on the list, 7 of them are from Sechkies, Big Bang, and Highlight who are 8+ years old. Also just think of all the boy groups that arent even on this list! Winner is the newest group and even then they are 3 years old.

This is in stark contrast to the girl group list. Red Velvet and Mamamoo are 3 years old. Gfriend and Twice are only 2 years old. IOI and Blackpink are 1 year old! Thats 15 out of 19 songs from groups 3 years or younger. Again, I cant emphasis just how big of a difference that is.

* Koreans love ballads.

You probably knew this already, but good lord look at how much Koreans love ballads. Not only with OST songs, but almost every top song from duos/groups, solo males, and solo females are also ballads. The amount of love here is also much bigger than I expected. If ranked from highest number of weeks in the top 10, Cheer up would be #1 and ballads would be #2-#9. 

Now before you say like Well this is irrelevant to your point because of course all the older Korean people love ballads so thats why ballads are on there. Keep in mind the Billboard chart in America is very similar to the GAON chart, but when you look at the Hot 100, its entirely filled with songs that young people listen to. The GAON chart is the same. Young people as well as old are listening to these ballads, which directly competes with boy groups mind share. 

Why is this noteworthy? Well again it shows just how hard it is to be a boy group in Korea. Just getting to 2 or 3 weeks in the top 10 is an incredible feat in that category.

* Things that surprised me

Unnies really surprised me. The idea that Unnies charted in the top 10 just as long as Big Bang kind of blows my mind. Also once more shows the power of happy girl groups when compared to boy groups.

AKMUs Last Goodbye also surprised me at how high it is. I personally forgot about that song and rarely heard it around Korea, and suddenly I see it with longer time in the top 10 than Knock Knock and TT, which I heard everywhere all day. Again it shows the crazy power of ballads.

OSTs rule Korea. Now I really understand the power of having an OST song for a hit drama. In case you are wondering 2017 had the mega drama Goblin, while 2016 had Descendants of the Sun. 

Eunjis Hopefully Sky also surprised me. I knew she was popular, but more weeks in the top 10 than Taeyeon? If it wasnt for IU, Eunji would have been tied for highest solo female that wasnt an OST song, along with Surans If I get drunk today.

This is probably less surprising, but Gfriends success is still insane to see laid out like this. They dont have a major company backing them nor a competition show to boost their popularity, but here they are. Also this puts into perspective how bad Fingertip did. 



Anyways, I hope this analysis benefits someone on this subreddit. I think many international fans get a very one sided view of what it's like in Korea. I also understood the Kpop landscape a lot more after looking at this data. 

Is there anything else interesting here for you?

The dance doesn't have to be recent nor does it have to be official choreography (it can be an original to a Korean song). The dance should be both interesting individually but also have different formations (because I'll be dancing with others). Also, any comebacks I should wait/look out for for this? Thank you~ ",47,28

For example, I have a bunch of anthems that fall into their own categories. 

Old School Anthem - [A Fool's Only Tears - Big Bang](https://youtu.be/D-mqnXQ4rnw) This song screams old school. Everytime it comes up in my playlist, I gotta bust out the body rolls.

""Crying Inside"" Anthem - [Beautiful - Crush](https://youtu.be/_5TJcaHO2gU) God bless this OST. When I hear this, I have to stop everything I'm doing just to sit in silence and try not to die.

Summer Time Anthem - Now I have two for this because I love them equally. [Really Really - Winner](https://youtu.be/w3HfiOlLhBo) and [Boys And Girls - Zico (feat. Babylon)](https://youtu.be/3jPavSMnDHo) Both scream summer.

K-Hip Hop Anthem - [Okey Dokey - Zico and Mino](https://youtu.be/r0Amwwh-d4w) Out of all the songs this is my favorite. Is that true? YES! OKEY DOKEY YO.

Girl Group Anthem - Im not a big girl group stan so I tend to not listen to many. So thats why GGs has it own category. [Dumb Dumb - Red Velvet](https://youtu.be/5MIbgD5iMXg) is such a jam that I find myself putting it on repeat everytime.

K-'EDM'/'Drop That Slayed Me' Anthem - [Beautiful - Monsta X](https://youtu.be/0BOUO6KWvcg) The drop that shook me to my core. Stan Monsta X. Stan living memes.

K-'Twerk' Anthem - [Mommae - Jay Park](https://youtu.be/uf8SZBFWQX0). I don't have to explain this.

K-pop Anthem - Now some people might find this category impossible because there is alot of good kpop songs out there and it's hard to choose just one. For me, I have to give it to my boys for blessing us with [Bang Bang Bang by Big Bang](https://youtu.be/2ips2mM7Zqw). All my life, a Big Bang song has taken up this category and when Bang x3 was dropped, it was my anthem ever since. 

What are your anthems? Also try not to do ""(insert favorite group here) Anthem"", mix it up a bit. I might add more categories later on if I think of anything.",43,43

[1/](https://twitter.com/OH_mes/status/885382679654350848) Stellar Gayoung is complaining how it's been 3 weeks since they made their comeback and their physical album still has not been released

[2/](https://twitter.com/OH_mes/status/885383035964710914) In reply, Stellar Hyoeun says that she can't even laugh anymore

[3/](https://twitter.com/OH_mes/status/885383141703077888) Stellar Minhee also says that every day is a war (presumably with their management)

Stellar's last single/MV [""Archangels of the Sephiroth""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ivBktSZ8yQ) was released back on June 26. Presently, their mini-album ""[Stellar Into the World](http://www.yesasia.com/global/stellar-stellar-into-the-world/1060825167-0-0-0-en/info.html)"" is still showing as pre-order at Yesasia, although it should be noted the digital release has been available since the comeback.

It's very refreshing and more appropriate to my age I guess, which also makes me wonder about the age demographic here on r/kpop as I feel like stan twitter for x purely consists of 13 year olds fighting over their oppars. 
I have tried using Kpop Amino and even though you can find people of all ages there, it fell pretty flat for me in terms of being able to discuss serious topics (or at least be entertaining). Most blogs on the frontpage are half-assed reviews and repetive and dull appreciation blogs. Not to mention your followers count and how aesthetically pleasing your blog looks is ridiculously important to the users. Needless to say I got annoyed by it pretty quickly. 
So Twitter &amp; Kpop Amino are off the table for me and I solely use r/kpop now. Are there any other kpop comminities you enjoy visiting? ",111,64

I've been a kpop fan for 3 years, but I've only really watched all the award shows in 2015 and 2016, though I've seen a bunch of old clips from earlier years. The most impactful for me was when BTS won their Daesang, of course. It will probably stay as the most memorable one as well, also because of the all the mess that followed the win.

Like for example, I have never been to a K-pop concert and I would love my first experience to be a Big Bang concert with all of them. I was about to go see GD but I was broke and now Taeyang is touring so I might reach for that. Especially since he was my first bias. But since I will have to wait for the ot5, it might not be my first.

Some things you can ask yourself is ""Who is the idol I want to meet first?"" or if you haven't bought a physical album, which one do you want first? Maybe there is a dance you wish to learn? etc.

Let me know what you guys wish for. :)",36,24

It doesn't have to necessarily be only their title tracks, but can be b-sides or even covers of songs if your group doesn't have a lot to pick from (ex. BlackPink).",40,25

I thought it'd be nice to list them here as sort of an appreciation thread. I find that even if it's just loving your comment, it's a nice gesture that they take the time to read your comment and acknowledge it.

I'm particularly interested in idols that consistently do it. There's obviously a much better chance on personal accounts of idols that are in smaller groups without as many followers for this to happen. Just not practical for the big stars. 

Here are some I've found who do it almost always which is nice:

Tahiti's Jerry - not only does she love comments on Instagram/YouTube but she will also directly respond to you if you leave questions most of the time e.g she's told me she's terrible at sports and Ari would kill her if she tried to roll with her in BJJ and her excellent English is self taught as she has a passion for languages. [YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCsJ0lJqBb_1cD42hFxNnoUw)  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jerry_tahiti/)  [Instagram food blog](https://www.instagram.com/jerreatfood/) 

The following idols will almost always read and love your comments on Instagram so shoutout to them too:

[Brave Girls' MinYoung](https://www.instagram.com/braveminyoung/) 

[Brave Girls' Hyeran](https://www.instagram.com/hrannnoh/) (ex/hiatus?)

[Brave Girls' Yoojin](https://www.instagram.com/yoojinbabe/) (ex)

[Marmello's Doeun](https://www.instagram.com/marmello_doeun/)

It took me a bit to gather my thoughts but I hope you all are ready for the ensuing paragraph!

I went to Monsta X in Chicago on July 12th. I had P1 ticketsthat I had bought resale off of another fan. [The view was amazing](http://imgur.com/a/c59GK)  and I love Rosemont so so so so much. My ult of all ults is Jooheon so the fact they were coming to the US was amazing! I absolutely /hate/ Powerhouse with all of my guts and they certainly didn't help that this concert. However, the concert itself was amazing. Rosemont Theatre is completely seated so the line wasn't very long, will-call was super easy. We got our wristbands relatively quickly, P1 had gold VIP bands and P2 had pink wristbands. The boys were super interactive. They opened with Beautiful and went straight to Incomparable and Hero. The setlist was cut from  their asian concerts, I'm not sure if it was a choice of their own or just a circumstance of the venues. During the ments they kept talking about how much they loved Chicago and how groovy we were! Changkyun spoke mostly in english and sometimes forgot what he was trying to say and gave up. It was super cute. During the second ment, Wonho took off his jacket and the crowd went crazy, Kihyun cheered along with us and Jooheon told us to make noise for his muscles! (He said it twice lol). They also left space for Hyungwon during Ex-Girl! During White Sugar/Sweetheart they were throwing chocolate out to the crowd. I stood in the crowd and waved my ass off at Jooheon in hopes he would throw some toward us and he finally did! I got a Mr. Goodbar from him and ate it immediately lol. Some people said they would frame their chocolate. But my favorite part was during the ending with No Exit and 5:14. Firstly, they were super interactive with the fans and were taking their phones and taking pictures and videos! During the ment, Jooheon [waved and pointed](http://imgur.com/a/FRhR3) at me and I completely died. They also left space for Hyungwon at the end during their bows. 

Now is the time for Hi-touch and photo op. They had us split into two sections, one for p1 and one for p2. P1 lined up first for the hi-touch. The order was Changkyun, Wonho, Jooheon Shownu, Minhyuk and then Kihyun. I told Jooheon to stay healthy and he told me thanks and did his signature eye-smile. Kihyun told me thanks for coming and I told him the same! They all were super smiley and looked happy to see all of us. Jooheon was high fiving everyone.

Now for the annoying part. For the photo-op, Powerhouse was putting us into groups of 21. Thankfully, a group of friends and I were in the last group. I lined up second in line for the last group (maybe 10ish of us?) in hopes of being in front of Jooheon. Unfortunately, Powerhouse was shoving us in the order we walked in and Jooheon was first so I wasn't next to him. When I walked in, however, Jooheon said hi super loud and waved at me again, I doubt he remembered when I freaked out when he pointed but I'll just hope he did! The order for the photo was (I think, the members after Jooheon and before Changkyun are a blur) Kihyun, Changkyun, Minhyuk, Shownu, Wonho and Jooheon. I was in front of Kihyun and honestly I don't mind!! I was glad to be in the picture with them. As soon as I turned to look at him I noticed he was a lot taller than people make him out to be (maybe 5'8/5'9). So I told him he was tall and did some hand signals so he could get what I was trying to say. [He was super surprised and said ""me?""](https://streamable.com/aia1e) The photo op went pretty quickly unfortunately, but as we were leaving up the stairs Kihyun and Changkyun kept waving at us so I waved for a few seconds back. It was a great experience to meet them! I feel so bad for the fans that were in the bigger photo as some weren't even near the boys at all. 

I would see Monsta X again in a heartbeat and it was definitely my favorite concert yet! Rosemont is an amazing theatre with a great view.",27,87

I started writing this and it got SUPER long, so Im going to try to mention just the things I really enjoyed.  


**The Concert**
The organization for people lining up before the show was kind of a mess, but they started letting P1 and P2 in pretty much on schedule (doors were at 7 p.m.). At 8:00 when the show was supposed to start they made an announcement that there was going to be a delay due to a medical emergency, but they didnt elaborate and everyone was concerned that something had happened to one of the members. Jeff Benjamin posted on Twitter that he had seen a fan lying on the ground outside the theater and heard an ambulance coming, so it was a relief to know that the boys were fine (but I really hope that fan is okay!). They delayed a bit more to make sure everyone got inside so the show started pretty late, probably somewhere between 8:30 and 8:45.  


At the top of the show there was a short VCR that introduced all of the members one by one. When they got to Hyungwon, who's been absent from the last few tour dates due to an injury, everyone in the crowd REALLY cheered (and they did this every other time he showed up in a video throughout the concert as well).  Before the encore of the show when the audience was cheering to get them to come back out, someone started chanting Hyungwon's name and [it caught on](https://twitter.com/brattyminhyuk/status/886064245179330561)! I thought it was very sweet, and I think the members heard, because Jooheon started it up again during their ending ments.  


This was a pretty long show! The setlist was shorter than the one in Seoul, they cut a few songs (Rollercoaster! Stuck!!! :( ) but they did do all of their main title songs. I think the crowd was most hyped up for Beautiful, which they opened with. They did a sort of rock remix of Rush; I prefer the original version but it was very cool that they decided to switch things up a bit. They did a lot of their slower, romantic b-sides (White Girl, Ill Be There). During White Sugar they were throwing chocolate out into the audience and they were really whipping that stuff hard, it looked like it would have hurt to get hit with it. They also did unit stages; Wonho performed a song he produced called From Zero (with NO shirt on, just a jacket, which was a lot). There was a stand-in doing Hyungwons part of the choreography, Im guessing he was a Starship trainee and he was quite good. Minhyuk, Shownu, and I.M came out in head-to-toe Tommy Hilfiger and did a super fun cover of Bruno Marss 24K Magic, and Kihyun and Jooheon did a cover of Lil Waynes song Mirror. They introduced the unit section with a VCR of the members in their units sitting in a karaoke booth and messing around. They did some aegyo (which they translated to English as coquetry, never heard that one before), and Jooheon brought back his infamous [kuku kaka]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7AMGTj8ly8).  


There were a lot of cute moments during their ments. They did have a translator, so everyone was able to understand them easily, but I.M spoke mostly in English and the rest of them tried speaking it a lot as well. At one point Minhyuk tried to translate for Jooheon, [which was a real throwback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K3L4WD8S_Y). At one point they made the rappers sing, Jooheon sang a bit of G-Dragons Untitled, 2014 and killed it! Right as he was starting to sing a girl screamed his name VERY loudly, he was pretty startled. I.M acted super shy, but he sang the first line of What a Wonderful World, it was cute. During another ment Wonho explained that he wrote From Zero because he thought it fit him and Hyungwon very well, and that it was about coming from nothing and going towards something. They also paused quite a few times to tell everyone in the pit to be safe and take a step back. Near the end of the show when the members were saying their goodbyes and thank-yous I.M said Its not Beautiful IN New York, its beautiful BECAUSE New York. which I thought was a nice sentiment.  


Shortly afterwards Wonho threw his sweaty towel into the audience and I caught it. I dont know what one does with that sort of thing, but I do know that A Night was definitely had by all.  


**The Hi-Touch**
The hi-touch was just fantastic. It was certainly very quick, which is to be expected, but the members were all very kind. Theyre SUPER handsome in real life, and so tall! The order they were standing in was Jooheon, Minhyuk, I.M, Shownu, Wonho, and then Kihyun. Most of them did just the basic high-five, but Jooheon let me hold his hand for a second. Hes my bias, so that was very nice. Wonho GRABBED my hand and held it, and he looked me in the eye and gave me a very lovely smirk. Kihyun also full-on held my hand, from what I've heard they both did this for most of the fans. Hi-touch was quick but fun, definitely worth it.

1836,2017-07-16,2017,7,16,0,6ngn6c,[FAN ACCOUNT] EXID's First Fanmeet In Singapore !,Legendary_Golden_Bud,1500134233,"This was EXID's first fan meet in Singapore and I definitely had to go meet them . Surprisingly I managed to get the 2nd row from the front and got a good view throughout ! Managed to get one of my fellow LEGGO to go as well :) . There was probably about 1000 people in total at the event which was quite surprising to me as I didn't knew EXID was that popular in Singapore.

 
**Outside the venue**


There were people giving out free Jeonghwa fans to the people going into the fan meet . Not only that there was this one guy giving out Hani's picture to everyone which was extremely kind of him . I managed to get the merchanise which contained a light stick , 6 A4 folders and an eco bag which my mom loved it and will be using it !


**Fan meet time !**


The fan meet was delayed about 15 mins but everyone remained calmed. Managed to sit beside a pretty LEGGO as well :) EXID opened with [L.I.E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnDSODY7bVE) and followed it up with [AH YEAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egqDPipqIAg) and the final song was [HOT PINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NaeaLW8CLY). The fan chants were on point which gave me goosebumps throughout the fan meet.  After the 3 songs there was the first game segment where the members put on headsets and hummed the tune of the song to let the audience guess . Unfortunately they were mostly mandarin songs and english songs which I didn't listen much to . Lucky winners got a signed CD of ECLIPSE . Then it went on to decorating a T-SHIRT by each member. L.E drawing was insanely nice , it was a tattoo on her arm . Hani's wanted to draw a crab to represent Singapore's Chili crab but ended up drawing a scorpion instead and L.E made fun of her. And it was a raffle to see who won the shirt which unfortunately I did not win one :( .



**Second Song Segment**


Unfortunately I did not know some of their songs here my brain and I was clueless for the fanchant. The only song I remembered was [Day Rather Than Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wEjz3RdnKA) . They had a special segment where they said it was only performed in Singapore but I didn't know the song (pls dont kill me) .



**Fan videos**


This was a emotional part for EXID. The fans in Singapore managed to get a video shown on stage where they showed EXID from their beginnings all the way to their meteoric rise to fame . Every single member cried and Hyerin was wanting to say "" We are gonna sing Wii Arae "" and it came out all gibberish because she was choking up with tears . The members went on to give their messages to the fan which was really touching.

**Encore and Hi touch / Group Pictures**


Literally for 5 mins straight the audience was shouting encore encore encore and EXID came back with one last song and god I didnt know what it was again . Jeonghwa was literally 2 m away from me when she walked down the aisle gosh that was a dream come true. For the group picture I managed to wave to all the members which were right behind me ! Hyerin looked at me straight and waved to me which I melted instantly as she was just 50 cm away from me. The Hi Touch was relatively quick , literally just Hi 5ving the members and Jeonghwa was saying ""Bye"" each one of us . 

**IN CONCLUSION**


God damn worth every single cent of my holiday job money.

I firmly believe that having an active subbing community for a group is very important as they in a way promote the group and make it possible for non-Korean speakers to understand their groups. That's why I don't understand why entertainment companies don't take more advantage of these groups and incorporate them into their promotional activities. What do you guys think? Does having an active subbing community help in a groups popularity? Also shout out some of these amazing groups who make it all possible!,79,226

For me it's Jackson from Got7. He's been working left and right and I wish he would just slow down. I've been noticing that he's been out of it lately. Like tired and not his usual loud self. I know he's said that he's not always happy and crazy like that but still. He's gotten sick more often so he's over working himself. I worry about my UB the most. :( 

Honestly I worry about alot of people. I worry about Chanwoo from IKON and if he's being treated well. I worry about Hyungwon from Monsta X and his current condition. I even worry about T.O.P. still.

Who do you worry about?",303,213

This was probably done but I don't remember seeing it recently (or like this?). The title speaks for itself. Describe your favorite groups and members but add some funny twists to it.

Monsta X - Home of the living meme boy, Hyungwon who just wants to sleep for weeks on end. The number one Monbebe stan that's probably too jacked for our own good, Wonho(e). The Maknae I.M. is just plain weird like don't make him do aegyo please. Papa Shownu has like 2 facial expressions and no body knows what he's thinking. Jooheon is the biggest lie because he can go from Baby to Baby Daddy in .2 seconds. All you see is blinding sunshine when Minhyuk smiles or does anything for that matter. Mama Kihyun will protect the shit out of his children but would probably throw them off a cliff too. 

Got7 - I swear JB has a bucket hat for all 365 days of the year. Jackson wants to marry the rest of the members but they always reject him. #NoticeMeJaebumOppa. Youngjae is the definition of sunshine but no one wants to be within swinging range when he laughs. Mark hardly talks but when he does, it's usually loud screaming. Bambam always finds a way to evolve the dab but honestly he's had the biggest glow up in kpop history don't @ me. Jinyoung is secretly plotting to kill the Maknae but he also wants him all to himself. The Maknae, Yugyeom, acts shy when he's told to do a sexy dance but we all know he loves it.

BigBang - Seungri still gets bullied after 10 years but it's because the hyungs are tired of him exposing them. Taeyang is always seen smiling but for what reason? Idk. TOP looks like a dad but in reality he's probably the weirdest one. You hear god singing from the heavens? That's Daesung. GD can wear a trash bag and everyone and your mother would be wearing a trash bag the next day.

Idk why the hell I made this lol.

I personally loved the seeing Chanyeol and Nana on Roommate. I wish they interacted more, but it really showed a different side of them to me. 
Chanyeol was super humble and I loved seeing all the other EXO members make small appearances.

I also saw how NaNa lived with her Orange Caramel members and it was shocking. Her interactions with Park Bom (and Dongwook) were really sweet too. ",39,30

Tuesday we are voting on SNSD top 10 Songs. Many of their songs have both a Korean version and a Japanese version. I want to know if these versions should be considered separate songs or the same song for /r/kpop Top Ten Tuesdays. http://www.strawpoll.me/13454877 

I'm worried that if they are sperate it will split the vote but I understand that many consider them different songs.

My plan when they did a tour here was to go to all of the stops. But when they announced there would be 6 stops spread out over almost two weeks during one of the most expensive travel times of the year I knew there was no way I could make it to all 6 (now 7). I did manage to make it to 3 though.  I'm just pointing out the highlights of each and interaction that I remember.  I also somehow managed to get on the same flight as the members from New York to Atlanta and am including that full fan account here.

**Chicago Highlights:**

* As soon as Monsta X came out IM looked directly at my lightboard for him.  This is the same lightboard I had at Kcon 2016 and I plan to have it with me everytime I see Monsta X.  I was row 5 in the pit right in the middle section.  
* IM looked my way a lot but didnt wave too much.  I got him to wave during an early song and then a few times during 5:14.  He was looking at me a ton during White Sugar when he was sitting on the step.  
* From Zero is a really awesome song.  I wish I could have seen Hyungwon perform it with Wonho.  Pictures dont do Wonhos muscles justice.  They are huge.  He also has massive muscular thighs.
* Favorite stage was Rush.  I also really enjoyed Ex Girl, its different then hearing it with Wheein and I like hearing Shownu sing her part.
* Wonho fell at the end of Shine Forever and looked exhausted after :( I think his choker was too tight and restricted his breathing.
* I dont remember what song it was during (I think Fighter?) but Minhyuks hair was all static-y and sticking straight up and Shownu saw and started laughing at him and Minhyuk looked at him like what are you laughing at??? 
* The hi-touch went super-fast.  I had put everything in my bag because Monsta X normally does two handed hi-touch but this time it was only one hand.  IM was first and he was wearing glasses.  I told him Ill see you in New York!  He looked impressed and said I saw you in the crowd.  At both Kcon 2015 and Kcon 2016 he said this same exact thing to me but he actually pointed where I was standing at Kcon so I think he just remembers faces really well.  Staff quickly rushed us.  I heard a lot of keep it moving while I was doing the hi touch.
* The photo op was probably a terrible photo but a good interaction.  We didnt learn it was 20 people until that time.  I was in the 2nd group but I went in later so I was in the front row not next to Monsta X.  Luckily I was in front of IM even though there was a person in between us.  I waved at him and he waved back looking super happy.  After the photo I waved at him again and he again waved back all smiley. Staff quickly rushed us out.


**New York Highlights:**

* During an early MC, the audience around me was all trying to get Kihyuns attention as he was waving at the crowd.  IM looked over and I waved at him and he waved back.  I also got him to wave during a later song.
* Kihyun, Wonho, and Minhyuk interacted with people in our section a lot and I made a ton of eye contact with those 3.  I was so happy for everyone around me who had a sign for those 3.
* At the end of the concert I was really exhausted.  I lined up at 4AM to get a bar spot and didnt leave very often for a break.  Luckily, pushing wasnt bad.  It was a tight fit and people were pressed up against me the whole concert but I never felt like I was going to fall over or injure myself.
* Hi touch order was Jooheon, Minhyuk, Shownu, IM, Wonho, Kihyun.  I said thank you for coming to all of them.  I remember Kihyun gripping my hand pretty tight.  I told IM Ill see you in Atlanta! and he said Oh! and smiled at me.  After also seeing him in Chicago I expected him to say something else because every other hi touch he has talked to me before I said anything to him.  However, Photo Op was amazing.  I got really lucky and managed to get right next to IM.  Our conversation.


    * Me: Hi IM, can I make a heart with you for the photo?
    * Him: Sure!
    * We both make a heart together and wait.
    * Him: We can wait until they are ready to take the photo 
    * Me: Okay
    * Him: So are you going to all of the stops?
    * Me: No sorry sadly, just the first 3.  So Chicago, New York, and Atlanta
    * Him: Oh okay (he looked kind of sad so I felt bad) they are ready to take the picture now
* Then we put our hands together in a heart and took the picture.  After the photo I thanked him and told him Id see him in Atlanta.  I said bye and hi fived both Wonho and Kihyun again on the way out.  Staff was super nice at the concert saying bye to us and not rushing us out.  Im super surprised that he asked if I was going to all of the stops, because that means he did remember I was at Chicago.


**Airport NYC -&gt; ATL:**

I arrived at the airport for my flight around noon.  I was a bit anxious for this flight because I was headed to Atlanta with Delta and Monsta X flew Delta to get to New York.  When I arrive there were a ton of Powerhouse staff already there with luggage and 3 other Monbebes.  I went and talked to them and one girl told me they are taking the 3PM flight aka my flight.

Monsta X arrived around 12:40PM and got out of their van around 12:45PM.  Me and the three other girls followed them in.  There were two more girls at that point and two fansites.  Powerhouse staff told us not to take pictures/record video so I put my camera away.  I asked the staff member if I could take a Polaroid and he said no sorry!  He was really nice about it so I also put that away and decided to print my ticket.

I stood and waited until they moved over to the security checkpoint and I decided to also get in line then because the fansites did too.  They were in the priority line but for some odd reason my line was faster.  Both lines ran parallel to each other.  I started off standing right next to IM but eventually ended up standing next to all of them.  I just stared at my feet the whole time LOL.  If they were really on my flight they were going to be seeing me for the next 5 hours so I didnt want to freak them out.  A lot of the fans nearby were waving to them and saying hi.  One of the security guards was speaking full very fast English sentences to Shownu talking about how long some of the fans waited for their arrival.  Shownu looked really flustered and started trying to explain in English how he doesnt speak English.  I put all of my stuff in bins and walked to the metal detector and saw Kihyun had just gone through it.  So I am actually going through security with Monsta X.

I get through security and walk over to a screen to see that one flight leaves at 2PM for Atlanta and then mine leaves at 3PM.  Normally they arent so early for flights and I was in denial so I thought that they would leave at 2PM.  I saw Minhyuk in the area where the flights were leaving from but he left shortly after talking to some staff in Korean.  I went over to the food court in terminal C (I was in terminal D) to give them some space.

I get my food and I see some greeting cards so I decide to buy one (it was $5, I really debated if I wanted to buy one or not).  I thought now was a good chance to write a letter to my bias (IM) and actually hand it to him in person.  A fan handed Minhyuk a letter at security so I thought I might have a chance.  Ive mailed him letters before and written tons of posts on the fancafe but I dont know if hes ever gotten or seen them.  I was debating when/if I would give it to him.  Im a stickler for rules and past the security checkpoint is considered off schedule.  Fans are not allowed to take pictures of them there.  But I also didnt want to try after they landed because airport arrivals get kind of messy sometimes and Id rather he take my letter on his own free will and not feel forced to.

I go back to the flight area, its around 2PM and I see none of them.  I saw some Powerhouse staff but the members are all gone.  I got up to throw my trash away and I see Kihyun walking.  When I turn around to walk back to my seat I see IM and he slightly smiles at me and goes back to where he was.  There is a dark restaurant/tablet area and he is sitting with Wonho there.  I sit back down in the gate area and ask my friends online what I should do.  They just said to wave him down and ask him if he will take it.  So I wait a bit and walk back over to the area and hes gone.  Wonho and Minhyuk are now near the gate.  They were both talking with a bunch of staff members.  Minhyuk was super bubbly and smiling a lot. My ticket didnt have a seat number on it so I walked up to the desk to have them get me a seat.  They started zone 2 boarding so I assumed some of the members might already be on the plane (at this point, I havent seen Jooheon or Shownu since security).  When I am at the desk I see IM and Minhyuk getting ready to board.  This was my only chance because I was already standing where they were both walking to so I said Hey IM, would you take this? and he said sure! and took my letter.  
I got my seat and they started zone 3 boarding (which is what I was).  I am stuck in the First class area for a bit because the line is slow and its only IM and Minhyuk in there.  I again, stare at my feet.  IM was in the first row talking on the phone and Minhyuk is in the 3rd row.  I saw Minhyuk glance at me out of the corner of my eye but I really didnt want to bother them.  When I got to my seat Powerhouse staff kept on staring at me as they were boarding.  I saw Wonho board from my seat a bit later but that was it.

When the flight was done I walked out and all of Monsta X was standing at the gate.  I just left the area and did not end up seeing them leave the airport.  They went out a different gate then fans expected them to go out so not many people did get a chance to see them.



**Atlanta Highlights:**

* Before the concert started a security guard let people fill in empty spaces closer to the stage.  Like not actually seats but he let people stand in isles.  I was row 5 for this concert but ended up row 3.
* As soon as Monsta X came out IM looked directly at my lightboard for him.
* I waved at IM during the first MC and he waved back.
* All of the members were looking at me a lot more then the past two stops (when they were mostly looking in the general direction of my section but not me).  I think they remember being stuck in an airport terminal with me for two hours.
* The MCs were different from New York and Chicago!  Some of the members did aegyo.  
* I got a piece of candy that was thrown into the audience!  I don't remember who threw it because I can't catch and it landed in my bag at my feet, I didn't notice it until after the song ended.  IM tried to throw me candy too but he didn't throw straight.
* During a later MC, I waved at IM and made a heart at him.  He did the same back to me.
* I started bawling during the last MC.  I have never cried during a concert before but the thought of going back home and leaving Monsta X made me really sad.  Wonho saw and started throwing a ton of hearts at me.
* During 5:14 I was still crying and IM blew a kiss at me.
* I don't remember anything about hi touch other then I was trying not to cry again, I was mostly successful. 
* During Photo Op I was incredibly lucky and next to IM again.  Our conversation:
    *  Me: Hi IM, can I make a heart with you?
    *  Him: Sure!  We did this in New York too didn't we? *laughs*
    *  At this point, he put his arm around me and pulled me really close to him.  We took the photo but I don't think his arm was around me.  He was holding up my arm for the heart though, maybe he noticed I was shaking?  I'm not sure.
    *  Me: So did you read my letter?  Remember from the airport?
    *  Him: Yes of course I did!  Your name is Danielle.
    *  Me: thank you so much!
*  I hi-fived him again quickly before I left and ran out to go cry to my friend.",24,97

2249,2017-07-19,2017,7,19,12,6o5wlf,[RUMOR] N.Sonic's Leader J.Heart Possibly Dating/Living With Foreigner,id4h0,1500434946,"someone posted this screencap {https://ibb.co/ewQE25} on PULL {https://prettyuglylittleliar.net/topic/2079-k-vloggers-general-discussion/?page=12] {youtube gossip site} and i thought i recognized the face. With this in mind I investigated but wasn't sure. Yesterday, the idol in question posted an Instagram {https://www.instagram.com/p/BWmo_bdj0rp/} photo that confirmed it for me but still not confirmed by people involved

**N.Sonics Leader J.Heart might be dating and living with a foreigner** If true, theyve been dating since 2014 and have been living together for over a year. The girl started a YouTube channel called DearSeoul and teases that she will show her boyfriend, but in reality she cannot because he has an issue with his contract.

*What she revealed:* **1. Met BF at a club, is great dancer**^J.Heart ^won ^many ^awards ^as ^a ^dancer **2. BF is 30 years old** ^J.Heart ^is ^born ^March ^4 ^1987 ^{30 ^years ^old} **3. Friends joked on tumblr {now deleted} that hed need a contract to show his face** ^Still ^in ^legal ^battle ^with ^entertainment ^company **4. She also showed his face for a moment in a video** {https://ibb.co/ewQE25}  ^his ^face/nose ^is ^totally ^recognizable.

*Further Proof:* **1. J.Heart uploaded a photo clearly taken in her home.** {https://ibb.co/d87YvQ} Same washing machine, tile, {basically entire bathroom} window hangings, and apartment layout {where bathroom is} **2.Always wearing same watch {couple watch bought by gf}** {https://ibb.co/gpT6FQ} {photo proof from fan taken photo, dearseoul youtube, instagram} **3. Same head phones as boyfriend in rachls instagram photo** {https://ibb.co/d3tj25} and finally **4. Rachel follows N.Sonic people.**  Rachel follows and is followed by @jxngwkhere who follows @thebj_ who is Bongjun from nsonic, jxngwkhere is actually attached to all nsonic members through instagram. She doesnt directly follow any nsonic members but is connected to them.

**what do you think**

if the photos links arent working here: http://s1126.photobucket.com/user/id4h0/library/?view=recent&amp;page=1

UPDATE: pretty much confirmed. i asked in a comment on his recent photo if this was dearseouls house and he almst immedialety deleted the photo.

update: weird the photo is back but **i have been blocked and my comment is deleted**

UPDATE: a close friend of rachel's {piecesofmyseoul on tumblr and apgujeongrodeo on instagram} boyfriend Sungil has liked all DearSeoul videos along with all her other friends at vlogs' videos, AND jhearts solo MV.

i know most of you have friends/relatives who aren't into kpop but who you share new releases/videos with, so i was wondering what and who they know thanks to you? and have you managed to convert anyone you know into a fan?",24,5

I finally organized this gigantic translation playlist I made so that the type of songs match each other a little more seamlessly. You might remember it from before.

So the tropical stuff is at the top, followed by dance &amp; EDM, followed by different types of R&amp;B, then acoustic songs, hardcore pop etc. The pop/unclear genre songs that are older than 2016 after all the specific genres. I really got meticulous this time so that people don't have to sort through hundreds of songs to get to a sound they like (last time it was sorted by year rather than genre). So since I'm excited that I finally sorted it pretty well (by my standards), I'm sharing it again. Also, the translations are on Musixmatch's app for anyone who wants to see lyrics and English.

By the way, up to now, I've still gotten no feedback on this massive thing. If anybody has any feedback or recommendations, please let me know. And if you have a playlist you want to share, please do!

https://open.spotify.com/user/1224401565/playlist/1DlJ8oxZFEjmT3P3Hrli5h



Edit: For anyone looking for where certain genres start and end on the translated list, here's more info: 

-From ""Tequila"" by G-Soul &amp; Hoody to ""Koko Bop"" by EXO is tropical-ish.

-From ""Cherry Bomb"" to ""Sun &amp; Moon"" by NCT 127 is electro hip hop (don't know what to call it)

-From ""Look"" by Nu'est to ""Highlight"" by Seventeen is house/mixed dance.

-From ""Summer Night"" by Skull &amp; Haha to ""Where"" by Laybacksound is EDM (especially house). 

-""Artist"" by Zico to ""As if it's your last"" by BlackPink is retro-style pop (80s/90s throwback styles like New Jack Swing)

-""Fire"" by JJCC to ""Been You"" by 24K is upbeat dance pop 

-""Dope"" by Hyolyn to ""K.B.B."" by Jessi/Microdot/Dumbfoundead is hip hop

-""Lime"" by punchnello to ""Paradise"" by NCT 127 is various dance

-""City Breeze"" by Jay Park to ""That Boi"" by Double-K is hip hop at a different pace.

-""As Feel"" by Glabingo to ""JameComeOn Baby"" by Yoon Mirae is R&amp;B

-""Calling In Love"" by Suran to ""Island"" by Primary is chill music and indie electronica. 

-""BeBe"" by Seo In Guk to ""What 2 Do"" By Dean are different types of R&amp;B (soul, funk, slow R&amp;B, etc). 

-""If You"" by Ailee to ""Snowdrop"" by Fanny Pink () are piano ballads and soft songs

-"""" by KNK () to ""The Song"" by Zion T are acoustic pop and soft pop.

-Everything else is pre-2015 pop or other pop that I can't quite figure out how to sort yet. 

P.S. It's updated with new releases all the time!

2396,2017-07-20,2017,7,20,10,6od6cf,Are there any idols (groups and/or individual members) that youve been fans of since before their debuts?,exofinitely,1500515289,"**Follow-up question:** Has knowing them as trainees affected how attached you are to the group? Why or why not?


Survival shows involving trainees have become somewhat of a norm in the current K-pop scene, and theyve produced groups like Big Bang, VIXX, Winner, Monsta X, IKON, Twice, I.O.I, and Wanna One, just to name a few. And having watched most of the survival shows of the groups listed ^not ^100% ^sure ^why ^I ^subjected ^myself ^to ^torture ^so ^many ^times, I couldnt help but feel more of an emotional attachment to those groups compared to groups that just debuted out of nowhere.


I was also already a fan of Seventeen more than 2.5 years before their official debut because I started watching Seventeen TV as soon as the Christmas Eve 2012 pre-SVT TV special was livestreamed over USTREAM and kept going until their last season of SVT TV, their Andromeda show on AfreecaTV, and finally their pre-debut not-so-survival show. So by the time they debuted, I already knew everyones names, faces, and what their most likely positions were. 


Then there was the whole SMROOKIES thing where I fell for a bunch of members, and now I love Red Velvet and NCT.


Im also first-and-foremost an INSPIRIT, and Ive known Infinite since their pre-debut reality series Youre My Oppa which I started watching because Epik High was one of the groups that brought me into the Korean music scene. As a Woollim stan, I was given so much pre-debut Lovelyz content, that there was no reason for me not to fall for them. Fast forward, and the Woollim Boys began catching my eye to the point where I would look forward to Infinites end-of-the-year performances (also Infinite F performances) just to catch a glimpse of them, then learn their faces and names. Fast forward some more, and they were announced to debut under the name Golden Child earlier this year. They just ended their pre-debut reality series 2017 WoollimPICK. Ive already fallen hard and am currently struggling to pick a bias.

***tl;dr: I recently realized that most of the groups I hardcore stan are groups with members Ive known since they were trainees.***

It took a couple minutes before they realized they were on the wrong channel and shut off the video immediately. They continued filming on [their own channel](http://www.vlive.tv/video/36024).

Also, going into this I was just a casual GD fan so I didn't know the b sides that he performed. 

This is the third kpop concert I've been to, the first two being VIXX and Shinee, so I thought I knew what to expect, but it was a lot different honestly. Since the venue was a lot bigger, the atmosphere was also more hyped and less intimate than the smaller venues I've attended. The concert started at 8 and doors opened at 7, but me and my friend got there around 7:45 since we were running late. We bought 6 shirts at $40 a piece (i cry) and then headed off to our seats. A fantastic surprise was that our tickets had been relocated (probably due to not enough tickets being sold) so we were moved from P5 to P4 without having to pay a single penny, and even better, we were in the middle of P4. 

The screen played a whole bunch of GD vids, and when the concert started with Act I's video, everyone went wild. He performed Heartbreaker first (one of my favorites from him, I almost lost my mind) and it was so hyped I was jumping up and down and chanting along. After that, he immediately went into Breathe and then Today (my all time fave GD song) and then 2 b side tracks I didn't know the names of. Then, he talked to us a little, said hi and all that jazz before going backstage and Act II's video started. He started off with a b side before going into Michigo and One of a Kind. There were probably more b sides in this part but I honestly forgot (I think he did Super Star in this part) and so the next section was Act III with That XX, Black, and Who You. Then there was a video of interviews about who GD and Kwon Jiyong are from lots of members of the YG family and GD's family which was really touching to watch. After that, he performed Crayon and Bullshit, and then a video monologue came up where he talked about wanting to live as Kwon Jiyong and how he sometimes feels burdened by how much pressure he faces. Honestly the monologue was really deep and touching and I was so engrossed by how he was presenting himself, I almost forgot he was an idol for a second. He then came back and performed his ""last"" song which was Crooked (amazing performance) and then left. At this point I knew there was an encore but some people left and after a few min he came back and performed a song I didn't know before ultimately doing Untitled (the stage I had been waiting for). After all of this, he introduced us to the band and dancers and gave his thanks again and again before the concert finally ended. 

All in all, this was an amazing experience. GD is just one person but he manages to take up the whole stage with his presence and you can see his charm from miles away. His English was amazing and all of the stages were top notch, I have no regrets about this concert and I am glad I had the opportunity to see him before he goes to the military :')",13,17

People gain and lose interests, sometimes they outgrow it. Preferences change. Some people are so worked up on who's a ""real"" and ""fake"" fan when most of them only see the users online. My friend got accused of being a fake fan because she unstanned a boy group but I know she's one of the most devoted fans while she was stanning the group: went to their concerts, bought multiple copies of their merchandise, streamed their videos, bought melon passes to help digitals. 

She just realized her preferences changed and that group doesn't interest her anymore. She's now stanning another group but she got a lot of hate for it.

This happened to me in another form too.

I don't get why some fans are so worked up about people changing/leaving fandoms. Can't we just respect choices of people?",42,14

Do you search by 

romanization/
English name of the song/
romanization + English/
hangul name of the song/ 
etc

For fun, I'm building an app that helps fans create &amp; watch **reaction videos**. We wanna serve the kpop fan community so I wanted to hear if you guys would be interested!

**Create**

Our app keeps an up-to-date library of the latest viral kpop MVs from YouTube. To make a reaction video, choose a MV from our library, press record, and react - we'll combine the original video and your reaction into the final video.

**Watch**

- Say there's a new MV you like, e.g. BTS Blood Sweat &amp; Tears. You can:
    - **Follow** the MV's page to be notified whenever new reactions to it are posted
    - **Browse** trending, new, top reactions to that MV
    - **Crown 'winning reactions'** - vote for the 'best reaction' to a MV. Winners get stuff like badges for their profiles :)
    - **Sort reactions by type** - filter by Funny, Serious, Dramatic, Group, Solo, etc. to find the reaction types you enjoy
    - You can also browse to see **Trending, New, and Top MVs** - the ones lots of people are reacting to
-  You can **browse and follow bands** like BTS to keep track of all new reactions to their new songs
- Every reaction video will have a **Request Box** where you can send the reactor requests for future reactions, and vote on others' requests
- **Crowd React** - watch an original video with multiple reaction videos playing over it at once. See how the crowd reacts!
- **React With Me** - invite a friend to react to a video with you. The MV and both of your reactions are combined into the final video!

Does this sound potentially fun to you guys?",12,0

2. **  (Love Whisper [title track])** - lyrical with a sultry hot summer mood that helps capture summer feelings sung by GFriend
3.    (Ave Maria) - dance song with a disco beat 
4.  1/2 (One Half) - a song that will feel nostalgic of the 90s
5. Life is a Party - an exciting dance song
6.   (Red Umbrella) - based on Shibuya-Kei (? IDK if I'm reading that right it says  and IDK what else that could be besides Shibuya-kei [which is a genre of music based in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya-kei))
7.  (Falling Asleep Again) - a fresh new fan song for Buddies
8. Love Whisper (instrumental) - fans will enjoy this after listening to all eight tracks throughout summer 

***

About the mini album's name Parallel:

* It'll have eight colorful genres featuring on this mini-album
* the album is called 'Parallel' because it centers around GFriend singing about how love is like parallel lines and how people may love each other but never touch or meet (if I'm reading this correctly, this album is how two people in love can't meet, because that's how parallel lines work since they never converge and only run next to each other forever)

2750,2017-07-22,2017,7,22,22,6ouzt1,170722 Red Velvet 'The Red Summer' Fansign @ Yeongdeungpo,ravingphanatic,1500730405,"Ive loved this group since they debuted - especially Wendy (lol). After almost 3 long years, I was finally able to meet them at this fan sign. I drew number 68/100 and got seated close to some friends, including /u/thenerdal. Prior to the fan sign, I had a gift Ive been wanting to give to Wendy and also wrote her a letter. Overall,  I really did not know what to say to any of them, but here are my interactions with each member in order!

- Joy: Joy was so sparkly and glittery. I told her I loved her smile and that her hair was really pretty. She gave me a really cheesy smile, posed for me, and said thank you. She was pretty embarrassed, I would say. I was pretty flabbergasted at how gorgeous she was in person and up close like literally speechless and all I could do was compliment her. I shook her hand at the end and said bye. Oh wow. 

- Wendy: While I waited in line for Joy, all I did was stare at Wendywhoops (not during the interaction though). She was also very glittery and sparkly. Actually, all of them were damn fairies. It was very surreal to finally meet my ultimate bias of all time. I was seriously trying to keep my shit together to have a meaningful conversation with her but she was so chic and friendly I was just taken aback. She was really friendly, asked what I was doing in Korea, and all I could do was try to muster whatever words that came to my mind. I handed her the bag with the gift - a custom made Velvet teddy bear with Thank You Wendy embedded on it (cringe, yeah) as a way of saying thank you for bringing so much happiness and laughter into my life. Her eyes widened and she said it was really cute. I shook hands with her and we said our goodbyes. 

- Seulgi: The moment I handed Seulgi my album, she picked it up trying to look for my name on the post it note. I smiled, pointed at the bottom where it was, and she laughed. I told her she was a really great dancer and that was she was really cute! She jumped back a bit, said Oh! and covered her mouth with her hand. Shes seriously so cute and sweet. I shook hands with her and waved goodbye. I seriously didnt know what else to say - she was freaking adorable! 

- Irene: Man, Irene is freakishly gorgeous. She asked where I came from and I told her California. I dont recall much with my interaction with her she mesmerized me with her dead stare and I felt my soul being sucked out as I try to muster some compliments to her.. Im a sad person. I shook hands with her as well and said goodbye. If I recall correctly, she did say, lets meet again! I dont even recall. 

- Yeri: Oh boy. She was by far the most memorable interaction for me at this fan sign. First off told her where I came from, she asked if it was my first time at a fan sign and gladly told her yes! I then asked her if she had any song recommendations for me. I didnt mean to put her on the spot but all she could do was sit there all glittery and sparkly going uhmmmm.i dont remember I kinda just stared at her for 10 seconds while she was thinking when all of a sudden. she exclaimed, SHIT! I god damn laughed. She quickly said sorry sorry! I dont know. She wrote Ariana. on the page. I asked her if she was going to her concert in Seoul and she said she hopes she can attend. I shook hands with her, said goodbye, and she told me we should meet again. Oh boy.

Overall, pretty solid fan sign. First time meeting Red Velvet, but honestly couldve had a better interaction with Wendy if I knew what to say. The girls are really sweet, I really hope to meet them again someday.

Thanks for reading! ",33,329

TWICE's almost doubled first week download\streaming numbers of the main competitors with TT and showed amazing longevity. But it looks like this year things are changing rapidly. BP's AIIYL achieved numbers that are pretty close to Signal results, as well as MMM, while RV is simply outnumbering TWICE with RF (we'll see about longevity if the song though) so far. The promotion for both PB and RV easily beats TWICE with almost non-existent promo for KnockKnock and average one for Signal. And I am not talking about b-sides wich TWICE didn't promote at all. JYPE's group obviously in a money-making period right now, but it seems like with all the activities that TWICE girls have right now (concert tours, Japanese releases) they won't be able to concentrate resources on Korean comeback of top-level quality, as well as proper intensive promotion. Competitors, on the other hand are coming closer each CB, and with the amount of power YG and SM have they can always add some more fuel.

So what do you think, will TWICE be able to dominate the market like they did or competition won't let them do so? Is it possible to see leader change?",29,0

I'm talking about failing groups; ones that debuted years ago and are not making any money. 

I'd probably be heartless and just disband them. I haven't ever looked at a failing group and went, why are they failing? Most of the time they seem to miss that star quality or stage presence. I think that even if Blackpink and Twice debuted under tiny unknown companies, they would have gotten noticed for their looks and stage presence. Even Red Velvet would have gotten noticed, solely for Irene's looks. For example, Fiestar does have its fans but I don't think it's going to ever hit it big at this point. They should disband and let the members focus on individual activities. Then I would just keep Yezi and turn her into a monster female rapper, because she is so good and I'm mad she doesn't do comebacks twice a year like she should. 

But I hope the rest of you aren't so callous! So for your favorite failing group, what would you do to save them?",44,25

I'm a fan of both groups, but when KARD officially debuted this week, it kind of threw me off because they've already put out a few songs, been on shows, and gone on tour. With Loona, it's a little different, because so far none of their releases have featured the group as a whole. Having said that, by the time they actually debut, I don't think it's going to feel like a debut to me either. I also understand the concept of pre-debut activities and using them to generate hype, but I feel like once a group puts out a music video, that's pretty much their debut (even if they haven't necessarily been on any music shows yet).

The only place I've seen so far without any complaints is KCON (tbh I brought a BTS and BB lightstick when they weren't even performing. Why? Because I want something to wave around. I paid a LOT for both of them and I want to get my money's worth. Plus it represented my love for KPOP) People can be fans of this group and that group. And what if the person has one lightstick or has a t-shirt for one group, but can't really afford to buy one for the concert they're going to? Maybe they just want to show their love for all of kpop by wearing a shirt of another group. Isn't being at the concert itself showing enough support for the artist? I just want to know what other people think about the situation. ",25,0

Hello~!
first time posting, I hope I got this right.  -_-

I plan on making whiteboard animation regarding k-pop individual, groups, singers, major events. Before that, I decided to lay some foundations so people can understand my background. So my first one is understanding quick kpop history 101. Then I""ll do couple more topics, then I 'll get to the idols. Little bit about me...

Long time ago I was under the name Twirlybox subbing kpop MVs (It got copy righted)
Then I was under the name knesshi subbing Family Outing (copyrighted again!)
Then Twirlysub making variety show sub (copyrighted again)
Then I tried KPOP KT (Kinetic typography) of songs (copyrighted)
Then I tried to make short biography of kpop using video essay format (copyrighted)

After some time off, I decided to make my own style so it won't get deleted. And this is the answer I came up with.

Hope you enjoy. I'll try to answer questions. I""m not used to reddit though...",15,26

Big mistake guys... Big fucking mistake... I then came to this subreddit and went to ""top"" and watched all the top voted music videos on this sub. I bought an IU and Blackpink album on my phone as well as that song ""Fxxk It""... Guys this music is amazing... I even sobered up and listed to it on my way to work, and I still liked it. I thought it was just cuz I was high, but nope. Kpop is fucking amazing. The rest of the western world needs this in their lives. Ok. That is all. Goodbye. 

Edit: Oh wow, so much support! What a welcoming community, thanks guys! Someone recommended I check out ""MAMAMOO"", If you have more suggestions Ill definitely check em out!

Edit 2: Thanks for all the wonderful suggestions! I think ill light one up before bed and spend another chunk of my evening watching these colorful and fun videos. This is a really awesome community and I look forward to getting to know all this music better!",145,865

Also, Chen's, Baekhyun's, and Xiumin's interactions in [The One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T8Iy2lktgo) MV. Specifically:

**Xiumin** *(singing)*: ..just me and you~

**Baekhyun**: What? No it's me!

**Chen**: No, it's not!

**Xiumin**: Yes, no way.

**Baekhyun**: I told you, it's me. *(heads over to girl-Baekhyun)* Excuse me..?

It just adds something comical to the song which I really enjoy listening to even if I don't watch the MV at that moment.

2999,2017-07-25,2017,7,25,0,6p8yvp,170723 NCT 127 Cherry Bomb Summer Event Train,jolaurence,1500908912,"This was probably one of the craziest NCT related things I have done so far. Last week Monday SM announced that 127 was going to be having an event on a train. All the information given was the date, where to buy albums, train station, and time it started. As someone who wasn't able to do any of the fansigns this promotion cycle, I vowed to myself that I would get onto this goddamn train. So on Friday on the very last day to apply I went to the furthest of the 3 locations to buy albums. I bought a box and 5 albums. Saturday came and I found out I made it! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS! I was going on a train with NCT 127 from 3 pm until 8:30 pm on Sunday. We were still given absolutely no information but were told that we would know more on Sunday.

I got to the station around 1:45 pm Sunday and checked in and lo and behold I was the only American. The event was run by SM Global Package people and some of the staff I recognized from doing the music shows. We were all given an itinerary and a bag of goodies: a NCT 127 Cherry Bomb mat, a NCT 127 mini notebook, a bottle of water that said NCT 127 Cherry Bomb on it (that I have yet to drink from), and colored pencils. We were given a lanyard that had our names on it as well as our car and seat assignment.

After 3 pm we all got in line according to our train cars [2, 3, 4, 7, 8]. There was a total of 210 of us on this train as well. After we got in line, we were given time to go to the bathroom if we needed. Then at 3:30 pm car by car we were brought into the station. As we walked in, the fansites were waving at us since they were waiting for the boys to arrive. We were brought down to the track and had to wait before we were allowed to go down to the train. Then we saw the fansites running and that was when we knew the boys were there.

We went down car by car. I walked into my car and all of us started to freak out. The train cars were playing the Cherry Bomb MV as well as the mini album. We all walked to our seats. On our seats we had a paper toy to color. I turned mine over and it was Johnny's. FATE. My seat was also really good because it was technically the front for my section. The seat would bless me later. 

After 4 pm the train started to go towards our destination which was really the very end of the line for this ITX train. Taeyong started the announcement for us and the rest of the members introduced themselves. Then Winwin, Yuta, and Johnny all made announcements in Chinese, Japanese, and English.

After a while we all started coloring in our paper toys. We were just minding our business coloring when suddenly Doyoung, Taeil, Winwin, Haechan, and Mark came through to get to car 2. That meant the event was starting. The boys split themselves into two groups for this. Staff told us to take out our notebooks and we did as they said. It's important to note that all of this event was recorded when the boys were in each car. 

Then group 1 came in. They stood on the stage in the car and said hi to us. Then they started to say hi to us one by one by taking turns. There was a clipboard with all of our names on it. Mark of course got me. He said my name and my response was ""What's up?"" The amount of ""whooooooaaaaaas"" that happened on my car since I was the lone  American. Thanks y'all. After they said hi to us they went one by one stamping our books. 

* [Mark](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoC4SXoAAD0Hl.jpg)
* [Haechan and Winwin](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoIT1WAAA0ln2.jpg)
* [Doyoung](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoC4EXcAENB6x.jpg)
* [Taeil](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoC4IXsAEE30V.jpg) 

I really couldn't get much conversation with the boys. I basically said ""hi"" and ""thank you"" in Korean. But then there is Doyoung, this sweet lamb. He came up to my seat and said ""What's up?"" in English. ENGLISH! My response: Hi. See you again. 

AND HE LAUGHED. I LOVE THIS BUNNY SO MUCH! 

When they finished one by one they went to the stage. HJ Manager Oppa was with them and he sat down in the seat across from mine. Doyoung was talking to him when he finished. Doyoung literally is the heart eyes emoji when he is around him. I cannot. Mark and Taeil were so touchy-touchy as well. My heart couldn't take it. After they finished, they said bye to us and left. 

Literally all of us girls just looked at our stamps and were like ""How do we move on from this???"" And yet here was my brain: Johnny is next. OH GOD.

After a while there was sudden movement by staff and that mean group 2 would be coming in. Group 2 was Johnny, Jaehyun, Taeyong, and Yuta. They came in and started waving to us and my heart started racing. Taeyong stopped at the stage and was going to say hi to us but staff told him that we're not the right car. So they left. I literally started to panic inside cause that meant Johnny soon.

10 minutes later and it happened. The boys came back into our car. Johnny was so tall that he couldn't really stand on the stage. So he stood on the side and he saw me. He mouthed ""Hi"" and his eyes went up and I said ""Hey"" back and the inside of my body turned into mush. Once again they were going to say hi to us one by one. Only with these boys they were being so cute. They were giving us hearts and telling us we had cute names and whatnot. Fan service group. So lo and behold Johnny had me in his group of names. He said my name and I waved and said ""Hi. Long time no see."" AND JOHNNY LITERALLY HELD UP THE CLIPBOARD HIGHER TO HIDE HIS LAUGH. ^^^^I ^^^^AM ^^^^A ^^^^WALKING ^^^^EMBARRASSMENT.  

They split up for the stamps and the first person I got was Jaehyun. And this time, I finally could talk to him and not just tell him he's beautiful. 

&gt; Jaehyun: Hi.

&gt; Me: Hello. I listen to Ennana. 

&gt; Jaehyun: Really?

&gt; Me: Every night.

&gt; Jaehyun: Do you understand it?

&gt; Me: Sometimes. But translators.

&gt; Jaehyun: Ah. Thank you. 

&gt; Me: Thank you. 

Character development! 

Next Yuta came over and he said ""hi"" in English and I said ""hi"" back and then said ""thank you very much"" in Japanese. So he said ""thank you"" back in Japanese. Taeyong was so short because he just said ""hi nice to meet you"" and I said ""you too."" 

Then came Johnny.

&gt; Johnny: [starts to say hello in Korean but looks up and stops] Hello.

&gt; Me: Hello. It's been a while. 

&gt; Johnny: It has. 

&gt; Me: 177 days to be exact. 

&gt; Johnny: [stamps my book and gives me this look] Oh. You have been counting.

&gt; Me: Well, I'm a Ravenclaw.

&gt; Johnny: I'm a Gryffindor. 

&gt; Me: Yeah but I win. Bye. Thank you. 

&gt; Johnny: Bye.

AND THEN I TURNED AWAY AND BURIED MY FACE IN THE NOTEBOOK. The girl behind me actually asked Johnny what we talked about and he was like ""Harry Potter.""  

Jaehyun finished his stamping a little early so he sat in the row next to mine and the girls behind him were dying. Same. Then Yuta finished and he went to sit on a seat but then decided to sit on the stage. SO CUTE. When they finished Taeyong told us that they would be looking at the paper toys and give a prize to the winner of each car. Then they left. We handed out paper toy drawings to staff and got ready to leave the train.

Stamps from this set:

* [Yuta](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoIT2XcAEm_kS.jpg)
* [Taeyong](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoIT2WAAAGumY.jpg)
* [Jaehyun](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoLbUXgAAagDW.jpg)
* [Johnny](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaoLbYXUAImfv7.jpg) 

We got to the final station and brought our things with us for our group picture. As we were leaving our car, the boys were still in car 4 so we stopped to look and staff started laughing at us and told us that we would see them soon anyway. We were brought outside to the Cherry Bomb bus but it was raining so we went to the roof of the train station to take out group pictures. My car was the first group to go and it was so awkward. We were like ""what are we even doing???"" After each car had their picture done, we sat down on our mats that were given to us and the boys gave little speeches thanking us. Then they left to get back on the train so we could go on the train. 

We got back on the train and when we got on we saw that we were given a [lunch box](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaSiHtXYAApIm6.jpg). Of course being fangirls, we all took pictures of everything from the lunchbox before even eating. We started eating and the train left. The boys made an announcement again and we just enjoyed ourselves. After a while commotion happened. Staff was running around and that meant the boys would be coming through to get to car 2. And they did. They were holding the paper toy drawings. 

When it was time for our car, staff told us to put our phones away and we did. All 9 of them came in and stood at the stage or next to it and said that they were going to hand them back to us. Doyoung by the way kept looking at me. Of course mine was on the very top for Johnny. 

&gt; Johnny: [says my name and I reach out to get it] Thank you [says this very strongly]. It was very neat. Which is why I liked it.

&gt; Me: Thank you. [Johnny starts to leave] I cant draw.

&gt; Johnny: [laughing] It's okay. 

Here is my ""[very neat](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaiuacXsAEbeH5.jpg)"" paper toy. And all of the paper toys were signed so now I have [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFaiuXFXsAAxf4X.jpg). 

My brain shut down after that. Like I couldn't even function. I kept replaying the conversation over and over. After they finished there was one girl who didn't get one back. That was because she had Mark and Mark thought she did a great job so she got a paper toy prize. They then did the greeting for us twice, once for each side. Johnny was right in front of me yet avoided all eye contact doing it. They finished and all said bye to us. 

We all got out our phones because holy mother. The train was going slow too since the weather was so foggy and hard to travel. We all sat in silence because how does one even react to this. The boys said a few parting announcements over the PA system before the train arrived at the last station. When we got there, staff gave us an envelope. It was our group picture. We were also told that we could take this little headrest thing on our seats. [So we all grabbed it](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFauiGeXkAAGddj.jpg). We were given the all clear to leave the train and we did. We all headed up to the subway in a daze. 

Overall, this was just amazing. One of the craziest things I have tried for with NCT because we had no idea what the event was going to be. The boys most likely thought of it themselves like the White Day cafe event in March. This day made me realize how much these boys matter to me. Is it November yet? I need to see them again. (Even though Dream has a comeback soon) Would I do this again? In a heartbeat.

Super Junior - [Mr. Simple](https://youtu.be/r6TwzSGYycM) Now I'll start off with the first kpop song I've heard. The one that pushed me into this damn rabbit hole. Still a bop to this day, fight me on it.

Big Bang - [Fantastic Baby](https://youtu.be/AAbokV76tkU) This is probably a first for many VIPs. 

BTS - [DOPE](https://youtu.be/BVwAVbKYYeM) Even to this day, it's my favorite BTS song of all time.

EXO - [Call Me Baby](https://youtu.be/yWfsla_Uh80) Still my all-time favorite.

Got7 - [Hard Carry](https://youtu.be/O57jr1oZDIw) Look, I know most people in this subreddit dislikes this song but I love it.

Monsta X - [Hero](https://youtu.be/FZ9lJ5ctd0s) Just like with Big Bang, this is probably a first for many Monbebes. God damn is it a bop.

iKON - Now actually the first song I heard from them is Bobby's Solo [Holup](https://youtu.be/-Tap_zZdkYA). It's what made me discover the rest of the group.

Block B - [Her](https://youtu.be/o0WCva5Stk4). The first kpop song that got stuck in my head for weeekkksssss probably months idk. 

I listed quite a bit lol.",101,85

Take SM for example, they hold auditions in South America (or nearby, at least), so what would the response be if a latin person was accepted as a trainee and debuted? If they learned the language?

I've been thinking about this a lot recently, since many groups have grown to be relatively well known in Latin countries....

To be honest (I know I'm going to get hate for this), most kpop doesn't feel entirely ""genuine"" to me. Music is often created with the intent of selling the most units, not showcasing the artist's unique color, beliefs, and character (this isn't all encompassing, it's just what I've observed to be a trend). I feel that as a result, idols don't have the chance to express much beyond what their company thinks the general public wants to see and hear. (Of course, this can be said about many music industries.) There are a few songs I've noticed that stand out in the ""darker"" regard, for example, Jieun's Don't Look At Me Like That. The MV depicts the oppressive nature of the Kpop industry, and the song, too, addresses love that is considered ""taboo"" (lgbtq and interracial relationships). Kpop has more than just catchy tunes and flashy sets (though I believe a lot of us love it just for that). What music do you know of that deals with darker tropes like rape, assault, prejudice, loneliness, and mental illness? ",34,48

For one, I've seen a tremendous change in perspective from Rap Monster after BTS did that show. Save for the ugly kidnapping prank, BTS fully realized that wearing baggy clothes, having swag, high fiving their friends, not showering and looking cool *is not* hep hap. It was a painful awakening as they went on missions to realize this (going around the ghetto neighborhoods, learning the cultural/political/historical significance of how hiphop came out, being aware of what is appropriate and what isn't) which is why some people felt it was cringey and awkward to see BTS mess up a lot, but it was an necessary eye-opener for the group (to the point that I feel they have better awareness about what true hiphop is now compared to some dudes we see on SMTM)

Do you think there are other K-Pop acts who need this hiphop bootcamp with Coolio and Warren G as well?",19,105

I have to say, Jisoo from BLACKPINK has been finding her groove (literally, her dancing has lost some stiffness and she seems to really feel the music on stage) more and more every comeback, especially this current comeback (""As If It's Your Last"").



On debut, I felt like she didn't stand out as much as the other members, despite her visuals. But her vocals live have been stable (but that was basically since debut) and less nasal sounding recently. She may be one of my top biases (mostly for her personality), but I still think she has room for improvement as a performer, but I'm pretty darn confident that she will come through as she is so committed to BLACKPINK's success. 







**Which female idols - old or new to the scene - do you think hold special potential that they haven't yet fulfilled? Why do you think they will or will not fulfill this expectation/hope we have?**

Thanks for reading :)

The introduction of Choerry to the unique universe of LOONAVERSE completes the new circle that Kim Lip and JinSoul has started.

While Kim Lip represents the color red and JinSoul stands on the border of blue and black, Choerry brings purple and white to the group, adding a mysterious vibe to the universe, unique from all others.

Choerry expands the colors of LOO with the track 'Love Cherry Motion', showing off her distinct girl crush charm. On 'Puzzle' featuring JinSoul, she presents a whole different style from the title track, and puts together a new piece of the puzzle named LOO. ([source](https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/posts/455830738127790:0))

Choerry's single album will come in two versions:

* Choerry (links: [yesasia](http://www.yesasia.com/us/choerry-single-album-choerry/1061119174-0-0-0-en/info.html), [kpoptown](http://kpoptown.com/home-music-cd-dvd/42305--choerry-single-album-cd-poster-8809516261286.html))

Each album will come with a photocard (1 of 2), photobook, digipak, and poster (optional). The difference between the two albums are the poster, photocard, and cover images.",10,103

For example, I love the friendship of Mark and Jackson in Got7. They just seem the closest. They even got 5 episodes of their own ""Markson"" show on ASC. That's when you know it's real.

I also like the friendship of GD and Taeyang. They have been through so much together. Even as children they knew eachother and the reached their dreams with the support of one another. Warms my heart to see how far they have come. :')

I.M and Jooheon of Monsta X is another one I love. Before the creation of Monsta X, Jooheon first started out hating I.M in No Mercy. All of the trainees did. He practically had no one and it was heart breaking watching him be all alone. When it came time to work together, Jooheon put his hatred aside and was the [the first one to open up to him](https://youtu.be/P107nsO8RXo?t=1896). Now they are bffs for life lmao. Still to this day, I.M thanks Jooheon for that moment. They just made a song about being friends too. What a journey. &lt;3

What are your favorite friendships?
Also feel free to share some moments if you like!

Edit: Added the moment where Jooheon opened up to I.M so y'all can cry with me.

3324,2017-07-27,2017,7,27,14,6pu17b,The Influence of Big Ice Cream on the Kpop Industry: An Analysis,vagabond2787,1501135184,"TL;DR: Big Ice Cream possibly has been subconsciously marketing their product through kpop.

Tonight while eating a bowl of Kroger ^^TM brand Double Vanilla ice cream and listening to Yum Yum from Produce 101, one of the girls inexplicable says ""ice cream"" in the middle of the song during Somi's chorus. Bolstered by a second bowl and inspired by the conspiracies post, I decided to get to the bottom of a mystery I've been investigating for a while.

According to this [market research article](http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/pressreleases/south-korean-ice-cream-market-driven-by-an-increase-in-frozen-yoghurt-sales-871316), the South Korean ice cream market experienced a decline of 1% from 2011-2012. The article lists ""heavy rain and changes in lifestyle"" as reasons for the decline, but I also noticed this time period was during the commonly christened ""Golden Age of Kpop"". Now obviously product placement is no secret in kpop [~~coughfirst10secondsofAOAGoodLuck~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sno_genwMz8). But kpop MV's usually don't quite go so far as to blatantly sell a product. However, my theory is that the explosion of the hallyu wave convinced Big Ice Cream to get in on the kpop game and market their product subconsciously to unsuspecting South Korean youth. Let's look at some examples:

* [Hyuna - Ice Cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlWZluzBNxM)

Ho boy, pretty blatant right off the bat. In late 2012, Gangnam Style fever was still spreading across the globe, finally bringing kpop to reaches further than thought possible, even to the attention of your grandparents. I'm sure there are earlier examples that I'm unaware of, but to capitalize on the Gangnam Style phenomenon, Big Ice Cream clearly contracted Hyuna, who appeared in Psy's MV to do a sexy solo song based on ice cream. 

* [Orange Caramel - Abing Abing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmjDyCF87dE)

I'm from the American south, so I was always a Blue Bell ^^R boy, but I've always wanted to try bingsu. By summer 2014, ice cream sales had [declined further](http://www5.agr.gc.ca/eng/industry-markets-and-trade/foreign-market-information-by-region/asia/market-intelligence/market-overview-south-korea/?id=1469715735211) so Big Ice Cream decided to say f*ck it and contract a group to sing a song directly advertising Baskin Robbins to see how much they could get away with. OC (R.I.P.) is of course perfect for this concept with their quirky off-kilter style; idk if an orange caramel flavor has ever actually been sold, but heck I'd try it. This song is better than most groups' actual comebacks, showing Big Ice Cream's willingness to go all out.

* [Red Velvet - Ice Cream Cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glXgSSOKlls)

2015 ice cream sales declined less than from 2013-2014, but the situation was still dire. I always thought this song was some lewd euphemism, but now I think it's Big Ice Cream using RV's sacrificial power to market their product. Yes it's technically about ice cream cake, but the lyrics reference ice cream directly, so same thing. People say that S.M. schedules RV comebacks to cover up recent scandals, but really it's whenever ice cream sales are low.

* [ AOA Cream - I'm Jelly Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaxUPPdXkaI)

It's not referenced specifically in the song, but AOA Cream used ice cream in their teaser promotions. Plus, it's right there in the group's name.

* [Macaroon Honey Dduk \(Produce 101\) - Yum Yum](https://youtu.be/z_854yKzjks?t=1m37s)

Understandably wanting to get in on the national phenomenon of Produce 101, Big Ice Cream slipped the inexplicable mention of ice cream into this popular group's song.

* [Twice - Knock Knock](https://youtu.be/8A2t_tAjMz8?t=2m54s)

And lastly, Big Ice Cream contracted the biggest group since SNSD, Twice, to mention ice cream in its song. They're a bit more subtle with it nowadays, proving their mastery of subterfuge and the success of their plot. So there you have it - conclusive proof? The ravings of a lunatic? Or just a shitpost?? You decide!

P.S. - let me know if I missed any other good examples!",48,223

3409,2017-07-28,2017,7,28,0,6pwmre,170727 Mcountdown Live Show experience,linkfoo,1501168938,"Hey all, this is my fourth week in Korea, and I got to attend Mcountdown today. 


We arrived around 3:30 to check in and get our wristbands (bring your passport if you're in the global group!) and then waited for the offered tour to start. The tour guide was talking way too quietly, so we fell behind looking at random stuff, and all of a sudden we ran into a kdrama scene being filmed. I don't watch drama, but my friends recognized the actress [edit: [Lee Soyeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_So-yeon_(actress)], and at this point we stopped even pretending to follow the tour group. A few dozen people were snapping pictures, and the film crew had to periodically shoo people away from the set.


Back inside, we bought snacks, looked at the Twice merchandise and went back to get lined up in pairs, and one person from each line was recruited for rock paper scissors to decide the entrance order. Our line was third. As we went up stairs to sit down in our lines outside the studio, they gave us gift bags with pencils and BTS stationary (yeah, I got free stuff with your oppas on it -- losers! ;) ). By this time it was 4:40. At 5:10 they said last call for bathroom in 10 minutes. The English-speaking staffer was WAY too quiet, so I couldn't hear what she was saying. Luckily the Japanese-speaking staffer was louder and my friend translated for me into Korean. At this time you could see industry people walking across including the KNK umbrella dancers. Six idol-looking girls walked across that I didn't recognize. (Turns out it was P.O.P.)


Around 5:35, we get herded inside the studio. I stand in the middle of the second row. I'm heads and shoulders above the girls around me and I get the feeling that someone is not going to like this one bit. As soon as I formed that thought, a staff member says I am too tall and need to move toward the left. I'm not salty because the MC stage is 6 or 7 meters behind me, and soon they start filming the intro bits. I can't tell who it is, I hope they turn arou -- OH MY GOD it's Cheng Xiao! And Bona! And Eunseo! They're right there. 


On to the performances! Just a few, I promise. Unfortunately, Red Velvet, EXO, and Up10tion didn't perform for the live audience. RV weren't even on the peninsula! :( It quickly became apparent that you can see the next group by the entrance waiting their turn. Protip: If you want a chance to be super up close to an idol, go the far left of the stage near the entrance. You have a good chance of getting a wave before they get up on stage. As newbies, 14U got closer than most and interacted with the audience. I was a bit further away from the edge, but I could still exchange a bow with one of them.


* KARD - Okay, I used to be a Kard skeptic. I didn't get the hype. A world tour, who are these nugus? But seeing them live I get it now. It works. The whole audience was into them, both guys and girls.

* Laboum - Among the lineup tonight, I was most looking forward to this comeback stage, and I was thrilled. Haein killed me dead forever. 'Nuff said.

* P.O.P. - This is the first I've heard of them, and I was starstruck. Maybe my head will clear up later, but my first impression is that they're loaded with visuals and great perfomers.

* Dreamcatcher - They came after a string of popular boy bands, so after having my ear drums drilled by girls' pterodactyl screams, the audience seemed rather sedate and unimpressed, by contrast.

* Halo - I gotta admit, live, these are some sharp looking dudes. No homo.

* Badkiz - I never figured out where they pull the ribbons from...probably because my eyes were glued to K.Me the whole time. 


At the award time, it's amazing, all these idols are on stage. I'm across from Badkiz, and I think I got a wave from Somin. When Laboum crossed my area walking out, I'm pretty sure I got a wave from Yujeong. 


Five hours later, I was exhausted and dehydrated, all I had to eat since lunch was bagel chips and Pocari Sweat, but it was worth it. Go if you possibly can.

For EXO I'd probably say [2:04 from their Growl MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3dezFzsNss) since it's when Sehun says his infamous ""E.X.O"" and the rap part begins......but if I'm not wrong, there also seems to be a joke about Chanyeol being ""3 minutes and 1 second"" since that's when the closeup of him appears in the MV.

What was your initial reaction? Did you get any pictures? 

I was vacationing in California last month to visit some family and randomly passed by Tablo and his family at Santa Monica Pier. I hadn't registered that it was actually him until it was too late. I just kind of glanced at him and thought he looked vaguely familiar? lol. I spent like the next half hour having a mental breakdown texting my friends to tell them what just happened and checking Tablo's Instagram (I found a couple pictures that were taken in LA so I knew it was 100% him).
I probably wouldn't have bothered him for a photo or anything though since he was on vacation with his wife and daughter. I just wish I could've told him how great of an artist he is and how much my friends and I love him.

As a Buddy, the main one I've heard to praise is GodFriend. As for the haters, I've heard everything from GFlop, GFraud, GSpot, NoseFriend... (that last one cracks me up tho)

Nothing for the fanbase, but [Yerin's teaser, ""Be Buddies Not Bullies""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFi6JX4VoAAlT1Z.jpg:orig) has led some Buddies to refer to GFriend's haters as Bullies. Seems fitting.

There are times when a western dance slips into the choreography. For example..


In [Movie by BTOB](https://youtu.be/tF06vrP_gG4?t=1m36s), they do a move inspired by [Juju on the Beat](https://youtu.be/S7uNBC6VEuA?t=26s).

Mamamoo are known to have produced their own choreography for most of their songs, In [You're the Best](https://youtu.be/bjBst20P7A8?t=1m14s), one move they do could be inspired by the [Nae Nae dance](https://youtu.be/vjW8wmF5VWc?t=30s). (Okay maybe not, but it's close?)

Although I haven't seen it incorporated in a choreo, the dab is [everywhere](https://youtu.be/1anhaaqvKjA?t=26s), [everywhere](https://youtu.be/_MlfabT_48U?t=21s).

[A few photos](http://imgur.com/a/wJYZ9)


It took place in the Olympic Hall. In addition to the main stage, there was a 'T' that stuck out and that divided the floor into 4 standing-room areas, where I was. Before the show started, they played pretty much every Lovelyz music video on the screens. During this time, the crowd did the fanchants, albeit relatively quietly, and I realized ""Dammit, I didn't practice my fanchants"", but I'm pretty much up on them from Destiny onwards, and I know when to yell ""Achoo!"". When the Woollim logo/music went up, we got excited for the show to start. 


The crowd was 96-97% male. I've known for a while that Lovelinus skewed male, but holy cow, I didn't know by how much. We were given placards to hold up during the first song, which was ""Wow!"". [edit: 3rd and 4th image in the album above] [edit 2: Google Translate has the slogan as ""Take the second step.""]


After 45 minutes, they changed clothes and did 3 ""subunit"" numbers:


* Jiae / Jisoo did a song where Jisoo sat on a grand piano and Jiae was at the keyboard.

* Babysoul / Kei / Jin did a ballad.

* Mijoo / Yein / Sujeong did a school-girls bad-girl concept with plaid miniskirts, chain belts, and disheveled neckties. It was full-on sexy. They got super soakers and sprayed the audience.


A few songs later, everyone dressed up in pink nurses outfits complete with stethyscopes and rolled on stage on a white convertible. Jin shot several souvenirs out of a cannon for the audience to catch. Later, they had baskets of little ice cream cone toys that they threw out at the audience. 


They did plenty of aegyo, of course! One of the times they did, they each had a syllable to say aegyo-style. The first four syllables were ""Lovelyz"" as spelled in hangeul (). The last four I'm not completely sure, but the closest-sounding term that shows up in a web seach is  (diary). So that could mean a new season of Lovelyz Diary? During a break, they showed some reality TV-format scenes of something that had '4.5' in the name, so maybe it's referring to that. 


I'm happy to note the tradition I'm used to of having an encore after yelling for it is alive in modern Korea. Before the final song, the girls one by one thanked Lovelinus for love and support, and most of them broke down crying. Jisoo cried ugly and it was hard not to get misty-eyed.


Random stuff:


* At some point, a girl in the audience fainted or had heat exhaustion or something and had to be carried out. 

* The one time the crowd went nuts and danced earnestly, I have no idea what the song was.

1.What aspects of K-pop got you in to it?

2.How would you recommend it to a person?

3.What do you think about people who hate on K-pop?

4.What do you think about certain fanbases? (ARMY ect...)

5.What other genres do you listen to other than K-pop? if any

6.Some of my friends who like K-pop say that the singers are cute, cool and that's what got them to listen to their songs. And they always rave about how beautiful they are. It seems to me that most K-pop fans care about the singers appearance more than the songs that they sing, which to me seems odd. Do you value appearance over the actual singing?

It would be nice if you could answer some of these, thanks ;)

I was reading some accounts of people who talked about how liking kpop inspired them to start caring more about their health and appearance, to start learning Korean, to pick up dancing, etc and wondered what Kpop has lead to for others. 

For me, besides caring more about my health and getting more interested in make up, I actually got interested in *Chinese* pop culture as a result of kpop. I'm Chinese, but I never really paid attention to Chinese media/pop culture because I didn't find it interesting. But after Luhan became my ultimate bias, I started following his activities in China and actually started having an interest in Chinese music/shows/dramas etc. Which in turn has helped me improve my Chinese.",187,150

Not entirely sure how one follows several groups at once, like say three maximum for me, as I'm only able to follow one group at a time with my methods.

I figured since /r/kpop is a multi-fandom forum, this place would be a great place to get some sharing of tips and tricks for keeping up with your favorite groups.

I currently am interested in the following groups:

* Music + persona: Blackpink, KARD, LABOUM

Currently, if I'm on the busier side of the week I'd just catch the vlive highlights from a X-updates account on Twitter or just use discord and save links for variety/radio appearances for a weekend. I'd also use Twitter to follow a couple accounts for pics and memes for each group.

Turn offs for this is that Twitter fandom can be too much drama and too invested in the fandom culture.

Any help lol?",19,27

I really got into kpop this year and have been exploring this massive new world and found favorites and non-favorites. As for myself, I just really don't care for the cute concepts. I don't like the childlikeness of the outfits and the sets and usually the music is way too bubbly and frilly to my taste. I think this is a reason why I find it a bit hard to get into girl groups since they tend to go with cutesy way more often than boy groups. Also, when the cutesy sound and look is mixed with absolute bizarrenness ([Red Velvet's Rookie MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0h8-OTC38I)) I'm completely out. Just doesn't do it for me.

Also, the waaay overly confident, borderline douchebag look for guys is just something that doesn't work for me. I like edginess, but the whole ""YEAH BRUH HOLD MY BEER BRUH COME AT ME BRUH"" look is too much for me. BTS's Rap Mon (and the rest of them) in [We Are Bulletproof pt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqhWHy0rrtM) comes to mind :D I really like BTS's look today, but in the beginning it was a bit too much.",46,42

For example, T-ara has had a total of thirteen mini-albums, while only **one** full-length album in Korea. Mini-albums are good for a number of reasons, and it seems like they're the most popular way of distributing music nowadays, with them being a group's primary discography (Twice and Red Velvet are ones I can name offhand). But, sometimes nothing beats a solid full-length album (like The Red, or Reboot). So, do you guys prefer mini-albums or full-length albums? What are some pros and cons of both? Do you think certain groups can be classified as ""mini-album acts"" and ""full-length album acts""? Please discuss. I'm very curious.",14,22
