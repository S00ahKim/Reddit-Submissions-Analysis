&amp;nbsp;

#### Basic Rules In Sidebar

We have [a lot of rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules) here on r/kpop.  They are very detailed and precise so that our users can know what's allowed and what isn't before they make a post or understand why their post got removed.  We realize that such a big list of rules is daunting for new users so we wanted to simply things.  We took all those rules and distilled them down to ten very basic tenants then wedged them into the sidebar.  If you look over there, you should see them now.  Additionally, if you hover your mouse over any of the rules, you'll get a little expando with more details about that rule.  These rules will hopefully make it easier for new users to read and understand the basic rules of our subreddit.  Of course, these rules do not cover everything.  The full rules remain unchanged and you can read them by clicking the link in the gold bar.  Again, just because it's not listed in the sidebar, doesn't mean it's no longer a rule.  **No rules have changed.** (*Except the one in the next agenda item.*)

Let us know what you think about the sidebar with these rules over there.  Do you like them?  Do they take up too much room?  Are the expandos working okay on your browser?  Any suggestions on how we can make them better?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Sales Chart Posts

We have very specific rules for Korean music charts (All-Kill and Perfect All-Kill only), and YouTube view milestones (100M increcrements), but we don't have any rules at all regarding international charts or album sales.  We're going to rectify that now.

* **International Charts:** [US iTunes Top 100](https://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/songs/), [Billboard Hot 100](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100), [Billboard World #1](http://www.billboard.com/charts/world-albums) only

These three charts represent significant accomplishments for any K-Pop group.  The US iTunes chart we're referring to here is the [overall Top 100](https://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/songs/), not the K-Pop chart.  Only PSY, the Wonder Girls, and CL have charted in the [Billboard Hot 100,](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) so that will be a huge achievement indeed.  The [Billboard World chart](http://www.billboard.com/charts/world-albums) is a lot more accessible for K-Pop artists, but only reaching #1 will be worthy of a post from here forward.

* **Album Sales:** 100K (1st time), 500K, and 1M total sales for albums only.

These are significant milestones for album sales in KPOP.  The 100K milestone will only be permitted the very first time a group reaches that mark.  After that, only 500K and 1M will be permitted.  We will no longer accept weekly or monthly album chart posts from Gaon, Hanteo, Oricon, or anywhere else.  Likewise, we will not accept ""X albums sold in the first Y days or other timeframe"" posts unless it is an actual record (as in more than anyone ever before) for a significant timeframe (First Day, First Week, First Month).  We feel that the total number of albums sold milestones cover all of these charts posts nicely.  All other ""albums sold"" threads be directed to the group subreddits.

* **Gaon Triple Crown**

Gaon awards a Triple Crown when an artist reaches #1 on the combined digital, combined download, and album charts simultaneously.  This is similar to an All-Kill that includes album sales so we feel it is a significant enough achievement to be posted on the subreddit.

Let us know how you feel about these new changes.  Are you okay with the milestones and achievements that we've set, or do you think we should raise or lower them?  Remember, these are rules that we are proposing and aren't set in stone, so please speak up and give your input to help us shape rules that we all want.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Title Formatting Revisited

In [last month's Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6qttra/town_hall_august_2017/) we laid out new title formatting guidelines and began very strict policing of those guidelines.  It turns out we may have been a bit *too strict* with that enforcement and we were removing a lot of posts.  As such, we have decided to loosen up our formatting requirements a bit. If a post contains **all of the necessary info**, but has small formatting mistakes, we will no longer remove the post. Instead we will leave a mod note in the comments asking the user to voluntarily resubmit if they want, and remind them to use proper formatting in the future. However, if the title is incomplete and **missing important info** like the date or location of a performance, we **will still remove it** and ask the user to resubmit with complete info.  We have already been operating under this new policy for the last couple of weeks so you may have seen the mod note on some posts.  We just wanted to let everyone know about this small change and we apologize if your post was removed for a small title mistake and you didn't get to resubmit it.  We want everyone to feel like they can contribute to r/kpop and be an active member of our community.  Thank you to everyone who submits awesome links for us!

&amp;nbsp;

#### Breaking The Rules

The other day an [amazing piece of fan art](https://redd.it/6x2qj8) was posted to r/kpop.  This post is a violation of several subreddit rules including #5 on the new sidebar rules. (*See how handy those are?*)  Despite that, mods allowed the post to stay.  So what's up with that?  This is far from the first time that mods have allowed a post that breaks the rules.  There was [Jimin's Heys](https://redd.it/5w8h2v), [Jay Park's electronics](https://redd.it/5g0cp8), [T-Ara's first win in 5 years](https://redd.it/6idapi), [Hani's heart-swelling reaction](https://redd.it/5lom29), [Seulgi's love affair with Pringles](https://redd.it/5t38kg), and [this dude](https://redd.it/6knt3e) just to name a few recent ones.  All of these posts are clear violations of one rule or another, but they all stayed up, and they were all massively popular with you guys.  Mods are humans, and one of the advantages of being human is that we can adapt and make exceptions when it's the right thing to do.  When a post comes along that we feel is too good to miss, mods will allow it, even if it breaks a rule.  It's not because we like certain groups more than others or certain posters more than others or anything like that.  It's just a judgement call that we save for **rare special submissions**.  We realize that it creates some inconsistencies, but we feel it's worth it to include posts like the few we've linked here.  Removing those six posts wouldn't make the subreddit better.  In fact, it would be worse because we all would have missed those things.  Of course, we can't make everyone happy all of the time, but we do our best to maximize it.  That's why we have these Town Halls, to get feedback from you and make adjustments to the way we do things.  In the end, we want to give you guys the things that you want to see, and sometimes things are worth seeing even if they're against the rules.

&amp;nbsp;


#### New Business

Member Yoomin recently said on SBS Love FM 'Yoon Hyung Bin's Two Man Show' that NRG will make a comeback soon. Their last comeback was in 2005, making this their first comeback in 12 years.

Yoomin has also posted on his Instagram [photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYcDYLWhemJ/) of the other 2 members Myunghoon and Sungjin in the studio recording.

Brief history of NRG:

NRG debuted in 1997 as a 5-member group. Their first album sold over 200k copies and their next album sold over 300k. They were leaders of the Hallyu Wave into China, a territory that had barely been touched by kpop previously.

The group was reduced to 3 members. First, in 2000, member Hwansung suddenly passed away due to pneumonia at the age of 19. The group achieved numerous awards after his death, and then Sunghoon left the group for unspecified reasons.

The remaining 3 released their last album in 2005 and due to various circumstances including military service never released another. However, the group never formally disbanded.

This was inspired by the Kai/Yerin thing where I saw people going back and forth talking about difficulty and skill level.  I thought that instead of argue in that thread, I should start one that encourages a more open discussion that people can maybe get something out of.  I'll start off with my own idea.  
Kpop teaches you the techniques, but tends to not give a shit about personal style.  The best dancers don't stop at technique.  For example, DIA's Eunjin, or Chungha.  Noh Taehyun.  Spax from Blanc7 is insane, a pro level breaker who is also in one of Korea's best younger breaking crews.  You can spot these dancers from a mile away because the way they move is special.  This is not necessarily something you get taught, it's something you generally develop over time.  Though I know a few cases where it's present from the very beginning.  Unfortunately not enough companies realize how valuable it is to encourage their idols to develop themselves like this.  It's the same thing as having a unique voice.  When an idol has their own unique presence while dancing on stage, they become irreplaceable in a way.  I'd rather watch one person with a unique look for half an hour than a group of clones dancing perfectly in sync.  However, I will agree that there is a certain charm to that kind of choreography.  But when you're allowed to add your own flair to choreo, it becomes much more enjoyable and motivating because who doesn't like to show what they themselves can do, instead of sticking to the same exact script over and over again.

I started watching and listening to kpop back in 2010 when I was in college. My girlfriend at the time (Who was freaking hot. Why did I ever break up with her?), a Korean exchange student, introduced me to kpop with songs like ""Hurricane Venus"" by Boa (anyone remember that one? lol) and ""Don't Go Home"" by GD&amp;T.O.P. The latter song became what I would play to her when she would go back to Korea for a few months. 

ANYWAY....now that I'm done reminiscing to strangers on the internet....I've always thought that eventually I would get tired of kpop. How many times can I hear songs that sound basically like that other kpop song I heard? How many times can I watch 5 or 6 guys or girls dance on an LED floor? Apparently forever. Because I'm still doing it. And you don't have to ask me twice to watch ""Expect"" by Girls Day ;) I guess what I'm asking is do you think kpop is a fad that will go away? Kind of like the girl and boy bands in the west did? I guess a lot of korean artists are breaking away and doing solo stuff. I like that. IDK. I'm just rambling in a discussion post on reddit.

I'm around the age that most idols are debuting at. I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about how weird it feels to be older than idols who are debuting now, and it got me thinking. One of my favorite new groups is PRISTIN, and most of the members are older than me and I feel perfectly fine with them. But the ones who are younger than me make me uncomfortable to watch. Realistically, it makes no sense, because the age difference is sometimes as small as six months. 

Why do you think age starts to become such a big deal in Kpop as you grow older in the fandom? Do you think it has something to do with the ageist culture present in it? I don't remember feeling this way about watching Western artists younger than me perform. I'm very supportive of underage singers in other countries and I don't feel weird about watching them at all.

overall N told me that it was pretty awkward with the members who only spoke korean due to the language barrier. btw no idea why she wrote ""dongsaeng"" after my name for the girls to write, probably because i called the older ones unnie and jieqiong ""jiejie"" lol.

YEHANA | Q: Your smile makes me happy even on the worst days. please draw me something to cheer me up! A: cat she drew says ""fighting!""

POP Goes the World / KPOP Canada just announced VIXX in Vancouver and I was wondering if anyone has any experience dealing with them? I heard a horror story about a cancelled concert and am a little on edge.. I mainly see them putting events on in Toronto so it doesn't seem to be worth a membership for West Coast but apparently people get presale codes too? I'm tempted but am also pretty sketched out by it .. 

Anywho just putting a call out to /r/kpop concert goers to see if anyone has any info or tips for dealing though this company. Also if anyone knows how else to get a presale code I would be forever grateful haha.. now that I've decided to spend 349 bucks on VIXX I would be heartbroken not to get tickets ;_;

I don't want to break any reddit rules and I don't post often so if I am posting in the wrong subreddit mods please remove! Thank you in advance everyone!!",9,9,False,self,,,,,

So I am a relatively new member to Reddit (hello!) and this is my first ever post submission to this sub! Hi! But I have been a lurker on this sub for a long while but after what happened on Monday I felt this would be a good time to properly join this community and share my story. 


I was lucky enough to get a foreigner ticket to one of the Wanna One Pre-Recs with a friend this Monday at **Simply Kpop**. I was at the second one where they recorded ** (Burn It Up)** which I prefer the choreo for even though Energetic is the better lead song so suffice to say I was exited to see the routine up close. For those who do not know about Simply Kpop and it's set up it is a Kpop Music Show specifically catered to it's foreign audience (as it airs on Arirang). There is a set amount of foreigner spaces that they allocate per recording and they make announcements on their website which groups are appearing so you can apply. The foreigners who get chosen end up being at the front of the audience and in turn closest to the stage/groups. It is also the smallest studio out of all the main music shows so in turn the most intimate of recordings. There were nine foreigners in total for my particular recording. I was the only black girl (as tends to be at these things!) and my friend was the only male. 


What surprised me was the amount of fanstaff - they had 6 people for 90 Wannables which came as a shock as I have been at recordings with other groups with double the amount of people with only 2 staff but I guess it is Wanna One. The fanstaff kind of looked down at us foreigners a bit as if we were undeserving to be there; didn't include us in the fanchant practice and when my friend asked for a Wanna One banner one of the staff barked at him a strong ""No"" even though there were some I could clearly see in her bag. We are Official Wannables too so that narked me off a bit but oh well. The K-Wannables themselves were lovely though and chatted to us, sharing our excitement.


As the boys came out, even though there were 100 fans in total the noise was insane. Daniel was actually the first to come out and the door that the artists come through is on the right side of the studio (my friend and I were seated on the left) so they got the first glimpse of the boys. They all came on stage and greeted everyone as best as they could on both sides. Jisung (my bias) walked over to my side and I couldn't help myself... I shouted ""Our Leader Yoon Jisung Fighting!"" (in Korean) and held up my Jisung banner that I got from his fansites. He saw, looked incredibly suprised but also super pleased and thanked me. I think for all of them it was the first time they were able to see fans so clearly and close (without being chased by Sasaengs) and actually to have foreign fans in the audience shouting for them too. Also just before their second recording I shouted out ""LET'S GET IT!"" which made them all crack up on stage and got them all shouting out random English phrases back. Daehwi was close to hysterics. 


There is a lot to break down for specific occurances but I will try to go member by member in order of interaction: 


**Daewhi:** Was the first to specifically talk to me. Literally seconds before they were about to start filming (like they were set in their positions ready) he looked up, saw me and went, ""Hello!... so where are you from?"" I told him I was from the UK and he replied, ""Oh cool!"" and then looked at my friend and asked, ""Both of you?"" to which my friend stated he was from Chile. Daewhi, Seongwu and Jaewhan ""OOOHHH""'d at that and all said Hola at him. He also engaged with my friend in conversation during the break asking him what he was doing in Korea and translated it to Jihoon who came over in curiousity. Daehwi is very earnest and sweet and spoke to all the foreigners he could - there was a reason he caught my eye first in Produce! He will go far. 


**Jihoon:** Always kept glancing over to our side of the stage, like making sure our attention was on him. My opinion of him completely changed after seeing him in real life. During Produce I didn't think much of him but now I realise MNet did him dirty. He is kind, very talkative (after a while) and *INCREDIBLY* manly. Like, not cute at all but oozes a maturity that you don't get to see in variety shows. I hope they stop asking him to do aegyo because he is so much more than that. Though I admit I loved that he got me and my friend to do a special Jeojang with him. What I really loved is that my friend called out to him ""Jihoon I will love you forever!"" and he replied back to him, ""and I will love you too!"" 


**Jisung:** His beauty got me floored. I was in awe whenever he came over. He spent a lot of time on our side when he saw I was his fan so I saw him up close the most. Did the Jisung Clap a lot and his cheering motion a bit too. He just seemed so appreciative and happy and he was so humble, how can anyone not like him?! Honestly, all common sense flew out whenever he came near that I almost passed out. He also told me my hair was pretty (it really isn't, its a state and needs to be taken out but I will take all complements when and where I can from my King) 


**Daniel:** He is so handsome. And incredibly sunny and giggly. It's true about the switch of personally in performance and out of it because when he is on stage... WOW. He came over a bit wanting to talk (perhaps in English?) but seemed really reluctant to try in case he messed up? Especially as he knew I was from the UK. I told him (in Korean) that his English is actually really good and he blushed rather cutely and replied ""No, your Korean in much better!"" He is so charming, for real. He has no idea how appealing he is or maybe he is not willing to let that get to him? Either way, he is the nation's son, brother, boyfriend, etc


**Seongwu:** Pictures and Videos do not do this man justice. Literally one of the most beautiful people I have ever had the pleasure of seeing up close. Lots of fanservice and was genuinely happy that there were foreigners calling out to him. Once got over-eager with waving and toppled off the stage but tried to cover it up like it didn't happen. Everyone cracked up. Also I would say he gives it the most energy during the performance. Like he goes IN when he dances. 


**Guanlin:** Pretty much always hovered where the foreigners were as he seemed a bit more comfortable engaging in English. He is super tall and really handsome - he will be dangerous when he is older. None of the Korean fans really called out for him so me and my friend did our part. In the end he shouted to me ""I will miss your passion!!"" (dunno if that says anything about the fans or he really wanted to seem cool in front of me...) 


**Woojin:** Cute shy baby bias wrecker. He stayed at the back a lot and didn't really interact with the audience a lot but did throw me a couple of hearts when I shouted his name. He is *gorgeous*. 


**Jinyoung, Minhyun, Jaehwan, Sungwoon:** They were more concentrated on the other side so didn't really get many moments with them. 


At the end of the recording , the K-Wannables had to be taken out of the studio but the foreigners stayed for the next artist to record. As we were waiting... did the boys not come out *again*?? They were being lead out to their dressing room but for all the times I have been at Simply Kpop that has NEVER happened to me before. I was just in shock and could only manage in awe ""bye""s and ""You worked hard!"" The guys were extremely tired but I think they were super thankful to us foreign fans - I hope we gave them some energy for the remainder of the day! 


And that is my story! And first post! I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you have any questions about it do treat this as an AMA! Thank you all!",14,62,False,self,,,,,

For the last few months, when I discover a new group, I stay away at first from looking at discussions/news stories/media about them and just watch their music and videos and I try to guess which members are popular. Sometimes I'm right, and other times I'm wrong, but I've noticed there's huge differences in skill sets of the popular members. For example, Heechul and Hani are popular for being witty and interesting, but Donghae and Taemin are frankly bad at variety and yet are in the top tier of popularity in their groups. Other popular members are the visuals such as L and Yoona, but sometimes members who are not as traditionally good-looking, such as Jimin from BTS or Mino from WINNER are at the top tier of popularity.

What is something that popular members share that makes them beloved by the fandom and/or general public? Is there a difference in members that are popular with the fandom vs with the general public? Can unpopular members increase their popularity in time or are they doomed to be constantly overshadowed? Why? What are traits you've noticed in the most popular members of your bias groups that makes them stand out?",91,80,False,self,,,,,

Since some of the most recent posts on LOONA have seemed to gain quite a bit of attention, I thought it might be helpful to make a quick Google Slides presentation targeted at people new to the group + wanting to get their friends/other people interested in the group. It feature profiles of the members, along with links to LOONA TV, the web drama, and most of their other content. You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o2RY5Cxpd50B9U5ooj6o64RiaulUGA0wiqY3mRs7toA/edit?usp=sharing), and if you'd like the TinyURL, I'd be happy to offer that as well.

I also wanted to express that I'm open to suggestions and feedback on how to make it even better: I'm aware that some of the animal emojis aren't working, but if you think there's something I can do to make something more clear, more interesting, or more visually appealing, please let me know! I really love this group and want to see them succeed, and I hope this is a good way of getting the word out.

Stan talent, stan LOONA etc etc.

EDIT: Wow!!! I've never gotten Reddit gold before. Thank you to the person who gifted it to me, that is very sweet of you. I also really appreciate all of the positive feedback and suggestions and will respond to everything now &lt;3

This thread will be the first in a new series which highlights the currently active (or just ended) projects by those artists on Makestar (think a k-pop crowdfunding site like Kickstarter or Indiegogo for those who don't know what Makestar is).

I'll be doing these monthly around the first week of every month, so hope to see you all here. Thanks for the mods for giving the okay!

**Currently Active Projects:** (in order based on project end date - given in KST)

**[A.C.E Special Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_ace/)**

* Date Project Ends: September 4, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is A.C.E?

[Relevant Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C.E), but short version: A.C.E is a 5 member boy group from Beat Entertainment. Their name stands for Adventure Calling Emotion, and they debuted in May with the single ""[Cactus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VYJKjyRjik)"" which drew immediate attention and buzz because they performed a lot of their live stages in [short shorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmEA6BSLSY8).



**[Han So Ah Official Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hansoah/)**

* Date Project Ends: September 10, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Han So Ah?

Honestly, I couldn't find too much in English about her. According to Makestar's page, she is signed to MediaDreamNet while the Spanish drama wikia page states that she officially debuted in 2010, but sang on OSTs as early as 2007. Some of OSTs she's been on include *Lipstick Prince* and *Mackerel Run.* She also was a member of the 2lepik Soul duo in 2009 before the group was disbanded a year later. She also had articles written about her in 2010-2011 comparing her looks to that of f(x)'s Victoria. She notably appeared on [I Can Hear Your Voice 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdRiG8brnNo) in March and her most popular song seems to be [   (You Stole My Heart)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cEz5-00sj8), which seems to have come out around 2011/2012.

**[Real Smell Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_realsmell/)**

* Date Project Ends: October 10, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Real Smell?

Real Smell is a solo artist (signer/songwriter) signed to MAPCREW, who debuted in 2013 in the band Common Ground, a [Korean Funk Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIH6BJe32IY). This project is a collaboration between Makestar and Voicecovery, but beyond that I haven't been able to find anything else about him - at least not in English.


**[LIMESODA Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_limesoda/)**

* Date Project Ends: October 30, 2017

Who is LIMESODA?

LIMESODA is a duo signed to D Maker Entertainment that debuted on July 12 with the song ""[ZZZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq5vqNeuI30)"". Not much is written about them in english, but one of members Hyerim participated in KPOP Star 6, where she was placed in the group KWINs (which were runners-up that season). According to OneHallyu, 2 more members are slated to be added to the group's lineup later in year, but no further news has been mentioned about that on official channels.

* Date Project Ends: November 13, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is EXID?

[Relevent Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXID), but short version: (due to pretty much everyone on the sub knowing who EXID is) EXID is a 5 member girl group who initially debuted in 2012 to lackluster success. It wasn't until a fancam of member Hani performing their single ""Up and Down"" in 2014 that made the group go viral, giving the group the big break they needed.

Who is Marmello?

Again, not too much has been written about the group in English, but [relevant kpop wikia link](http://kpop.wikia.com/wiki/MARMELLO). The group is a 5 member female band, who is signed to  Rolling CultureOne. They debuted just a few months ago (in May to be exact) with the single ""[Puppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjIQP56CxU),"" which is currently their only release so far.

* Date Project Ends: January 2, 2018

Who is 14U?

14U (pronounced One For You) is a 14 member boy group from BG Entertainment. The group is actually made up in two subunits (think EXO K/M), one being 14U-X (the ""masculine charisma"" subunit) and 14U-L (the ""cute friendly charms"" subunit) with 7 members in each subunit - though they are currently promoting as a whole team. The group debuted in July with the song ""[VVV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b83iEHH_UTU),"" but were soon dragged into a controversy when member Doyool was falsely accused of ""dissing"" Kyungsoo of EXO. It was soon revealed that this post was actually from an impersonator account and BG is currently taking legal action against the impersonator.",4,24,False,self,,,,,

So basically these are ether references, random sounds, or a sampled tune in the song.

What I can think of right now is -

* In Mobb's Hit Me, the line [""jibe gaji ma baby""](https://youtu.be/AUZpMSbE-Z8?t=249), is a reference to GD &amp; TOP's [Don't Go Home](https://youtu.be/IGNrOPzDuTQ?t=21).

* In Monsta X's Need U, Jooheon's [rap](https://youtu.be/Xj0AcZMAqP4?t=96) references Gollum (i think?), the Joker, and their other song All In. (MX references All In alot lol)

* In Bobby's HOLUP, the laughter you hear in the background (mostly in the [beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tap_zZdkYA) and [end](https://youtu.be/-Tap_zZdkYA?t=191)) is the other iKON members.

* Idk if this counts but in EXO's Lotto, there is random ass sneeze that gets me every time at [1:03](https://youtu.be/jAr_kPxowVs?t=62) lol. (You can hear it better with head phones. Left side I think?)

I'll add more if I come up with anything else. But what can you think of? ",30,55,False,self,,,,,

For this festival, the tickets are free but you have to reserve them. When you reserve your tickets, you pick them up at the venue the day of the concert but the earlier you are there, the better the tickets. About two weeks ago, the reservations went live but the site crashed because of Wannables trying to get reservations. The organizers then stopped taking reservations. So there went my chance of celebrating my one year anniversary of seeing NCT for the first time and my one year anniversary of the first ever kpop related thing I went to when I first moved to Korea. OR SO I THOUGHT.

Yesterday a little after 11 am, a friend of mine who is also a NCTzen (and Wannable) sent me a message ""You want to do Sky Festival? I found tickets."" After 30 seconds of hesitation because I already had plans, the chance of seeing ~~Johnny~~ NCT 127 again won and I said ""Screw it. Let's do it."" So I got dressed and rushed to the airport to meet up with my friend. 

Them: This is the craziest thing I have ever done.

Me: Oh, just you wait. [Since they just arrived in South Korea last week for school] 

We got to the field and waited to get our tickets from the perspective people and just hung around, gossiping about other fandoms because that is what one does sometimes. After a while, the afternoon rehearsal started and I started to freak out because ONF!!!!!! MY PRECIOUS WM BUBS! They rehearsed for a few times. Before they rehearsed two of the girl groups rehearsed. After ONF I believe Dreamcatcher rehearsed. After Dreamcatcher I about died because lo and behold, my son, Samuel was there. The amount of screams of people just watching him rehearse. My baby! 

After he finished, all of a sudden a few boys walked out and it was Boyfriend! Me: dsjhbjdfhgbljhghfjdsgjhgdfjhlfds The one thing I love about festivals is that I can be multifandom. After Boyfriend finished, these other boys walked on stage and I knew. I just knew. And that was when I died inside cause John Suh was wearing black and I was just gone. So gone. I was by a few of the NCT fansites during this point and I was containing my screams. I only screamed once when Johnny sang whoops. Mark, Haechan and Doyoung were tired but didn't show it. They had arrived from Jakarta just that morning and the three of them had Inki still. [Fan account of the NCT Dream Postrec from the weekend before will be up on /r/NCT later this week when I have the time]

After they finished, an announcement was made that there would be no more rehearsal so everyone left. I waited with my friend for a while before we went in 30 minutes before the concert began. The crowd there was 95% Wannables and 5% everyone else. I got to my seat and I was by a NCTzen. We acknowledged each other because we were alone in the sea of Wannables. 

This was the order of the concert: 

* ONF [1 song]
* Apple B [1 song]
* Dreamcatcher [1 song]
* VIXX LR [2 songs]
* Favorite [1 song]
* CLC [2 songs]
* Laboum [2 songs]
* Boyfriend [2 songs]
* Samuel [2 songs]
*  Wanna One [3 songs]
* NCT 127 [3 songs, including the Cherry Bomb dance intro]
* B1A4 [3 songs???? I left to beat the train rush.]

Here's the general rule for festival concerts that are seated in Korea: You stay in our seat. You stay sitting. You do not stand up when your group performs. Pretty much all of the fanbases followed that rule from what I saw except for one. I'll get to that later.

ONF was so good! I was so proud of them! They are just adorable! Apple B was super cute. But Dreamcatcher! OH MY GOD! That crowd was hyped for them. Really hyped! They were so good! VIXX LR was once again god tier. Ravi serving looks ayyyy my boy. I really love VIXX and any version of VIXX is beautiful. Favorite performed and they were cute.

But then I saw my underappreciated angels, CLC. They deserve so much more recognition. They also deserve better from Cube. Also, I would still die for Sorn. After CLC was Laboum and I jammed along because their songs and pretty much bops but no one pays attention to them. After Laboum, Boyfriend performed and I was crying inside. I'm so happy they are back. They deserve so much love. They really do. After them was Samuel and that was when I lost it.

I've been following Samuel since the Pledis years and finally seeing him on stage. I'm fine. I'm fine. Not crying at all. There were so many screams for him as well. I really, really hope he does well over here. I really do. He's so precious and pure and lovely. Please protect my son. 

After I sobbed over Samuel, Leeteuk, who was MC for this because of course he was, mentioned the group I was actually dreading. This is when I am going to get real in a fan account so I apologize but kfandom is totally different from Ifandom. Wanna One right now is one of the biggest groups in Korea, there's no denying that. But because they have gotten so big so fast, their fandom is literally a mess. It is awful. Look, I have gone to concerts and dealt with Army, EXO-Ls, and Cassies. They are nothing compared to Wannables. Wannables are scary. And because the thirst is so real (I call it the Wanna Thirst), fansites from 3rd Generation groups are leaving to go do Wanna One because fansites are all about money. Some of your favorite fansites might have already joined the other side and you don't even know it. It's happening with NCT as well. There is a reason why you are seeing posts online about EXO-Ls making sure EXO songs are still in the charts. They are legitimately afraid right now. Wanna One is literally changing the way kpop is done over in South Korea and it is scary. And yes. Wanna One did a great performance but after they finished, 75% of the audience then left. There are so many reasons why I look and see if Wanna One is in the lineup for things and that is one of the many reasons: the fans. I'm just telling you all what it is here. This mess of a fandom needs to be sorted out soon or else everything is going to be even messier.

After Wanna One performed, I turned on my light sticks and prepared myself for my boys. One year to the day of first seeing NCT, I was seeing them for the 27th time. [A friend of mine pointed out 1 year, 27 times, 127, as I was going home from the cocnert and I about cried inside. Fate.] The first song they did was Limitless and I was so happy. It has been 82 years since I last got to do that chant. Me, NCTzen girl, and a few other NCTzens behind us were yelling the chant as loud as we could and you could audibly hear the fandom section in the front. I screamed so loud when Johnny had his line. The ladies around me judged me. Only 40 people were allowed in the fandom section for NCT. It's a war to get into 127 related things sometimes, ladies. After that they did 0 Mile, and once again I did the fan chant. When they finished, Taeyong had them do the greeting and then he mentioned that this was at the airport, it's a very international place so then Yuta, Winwin, Johnny, and Mark all gave messages in Japanese, Mandarin, and English respectively. [Side note: all the boys looked good that night, especially regarding the fact that they had just performed in Jakarta the night before and then rushed to the airport to get on the flight to Incheon for their next schedule] After that, Taeyong led us in the now battle cry of Cherry Bomb. Then, they did that dance intro for Cherry Bomb and I screamed so loud. This group I swear. There were a lot of screams for 127 because of the choreo. As expected though because that choreo is just deadly. 

After they finished, I left right was B1A4 started because it would take me 2 hours to get home. But I knew B1A4 would do an amazing job since they are perfect. I was able to actually get on a shuttle bus this year to the airport and get on a non-crowded train. 

Overall, it was a good night and a good time. I got to see 127 again so I'm happy for a while...or until October 1 when I hopefully see them at another festival.

here's the deal. Youngest member Yulhee of girl group Laboum has been absent for weeks (since August 15) from all schedules without an official statement from the company or from her personally. 
Things are not looking so rosy among Lattes on twitter. Fans are getting more and more angry each day with the lack of statements regarding. One Yulhee fansite has closed down. A Latte has come up with this [statement!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DI8nlEDWsAARPaw.jpg:large)  that I have seen various Lattes tweet @ the official Laboum account &amp; NH Media. I took the liberty to translate it so international fans can understand too
[translation!](https://i.imgur.com/EqZXwnZ.png)

If you have a twitter, **please tweet the original Korean (!!!) image** @OfficialLaboum and @nhmedia_global
Feel free to spread the English translation together with the original Korean image in tweets and on other pages, so people can save the Korean one and tweet it at the company. Alternatively, you can retweet [this!](https://twitter.com/ijibel/status/905006325721161728)

* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)

* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

I always love reading these fan accounts so I decided to write one about this concert. Enlgish isnt my main language so there might be things that are gramatically incorrect but w/e.

First of all, I had a Ultimate KARD Package which included entering the place early, hi-touch and a group photo. The concert was in a local which fitted about 1000 people and the show got sold out. I think I have to say also that this concert was possible due to the campaign in MyMusicTaste, so we really made it happen. I only have [1 photo](http://i.imgur.com/iAhqZO6.jpg) and [1 video](https://twitter.com/TJSGSG/status/905191499054419968) about the show.

**Before the concert:** This was obviously the worst part. Queues are always horrible but I didn't imagine it to be that bad (my 1st time going to a long queue like this). My idea was to go to the queue at 10:30am or so, but I woke up at 8:00am and in the KARD group chat some people were saying that there were a lot of people already, so at 9:30 I was already there. I was alone and I'm shy, but thankfully in Spain we are usually nice and friendly so it wasn't hard to form a little group. KARD Spanish fanbase started giving numbers so people had their place, but there was only TWO persons putting numbers for all the three types of tickets, so that was a mess. Also, they kept moving us from street to street and it was all so confusing and the BOILING weather just made it worse. Thankfully, when you had your number you could hang out around there and that was a fun time. There was a lot of fan made merchandising like this [pins](http://i.imgur.com/zlrDx6M.jpg), [fans (horrible photo)](http://i.imgur.com/fvKG4Zh.jpg), and some other things. There was also a little random play dance, and I danced the hell out to Red Flavour, Why Don't You Know (the only guy who knew it btw), Touch My Body and a few more, it was really fun. After that, at 12:30pm we had to stay in the queue again and it was horrible because until 02:00pm (actually later because they were eating) the MyMusicTaste staff didn't came and gave us the [bracelets](http://i.imgur.com/V8POv05.jpg). After that you could go until 05:30pm (obviously later) when my type of ticket entered the local.

**In the concert**: As I said, I entered a little later than 05:30pm. I was surprised to be so near the stage since I was 155, but there were only 4 lines of people in front of me. The wait was HORRIBLE until the show started. We had to be there 2 hours of heat, sweat and boredome (they started putting KARD songs when half an hour was left), but then, it started. I might get the order wrong but the set list was: 

Don't Recall (English Version) - Oh NaNa - Monster - Q&amp;A -  BBHMM (Jiwoo and J.Seph) - Talk - The Way (Somin and BM) - Talk - Interactive game (the audience had to guess a word they interpreted without words, they chose a person in the audience and if he got it right he won a signed album) - it gets a little blurry here but I think it was Can't Stop - Rumour - Talk - Side To Side - Empire State of Mind - Talk - Hola Hola - Host Talk - Living Good - Don't Recall (Korean Version) - Audience photo - End.

I have to mention a few things. In the Q&amp;A they were asked how it felt to have the show sold out here and apparently they didn't know and their faces were PRICELESS I LOVED IT. Also, I think it was in one of the talks that one of the girls I was with and me started waving at BM and HE FREAKING WAVED AT US AND WE JUST STARTED SCREAMING. Also in the same talk they all said they didn't expect us to be so wild and that that was the best Monster stage they had in the whole tour (that's what you get in Spain), and that they for sure wanted to come back (I'm sure they said that everywhere but it felt sincere, and I'm hopeful). Everyone was so nice, we sang when we had to sing, we shut up when we had to, everyone was so nice to each other I was surprised. And of course I have to mention the INCREDIBLE HOST [KIBADUBS](https://www.youtube.com/user/KibaDubs). He's a Spanish YouTuber who makes kpop parodies and he's so funny and I'm a big fan I was so surprised when he came out. He was an incredible host, being funny and cheerful I loved him, and even after the show he talked a lot to people and had photos with everyone I swear he's the nicest. 

**Hi-touch and group photo**: Thankfully, it didn't take too long after the concert to do them, only an hour for both of them. The hi-touch is what you get, touching their hand and saying some short sentence, I said 'so cool' to J.seph, 'my crush' to Jiwoo, 'so sexy' to Somin and 'swag' to BM AND HE FREAKING DABBED AT ME AND I DABBED HIM BACK I DIED. Also, Somin's smile is literally the prettiest I swear. It's weird because I don't remember touching Jiwoo and J.seph's hands but I guess Somin and BM numbed my memories. Short after there was the group photo. It was group of 10 people, they were sitting in chairs and there were 5 people behind and 5 people in front of them sitting. I sat in front of Jiwoo (my bias) but I was asked to move to BM and then to Somin, but I didn't care a lot since I GOT TO DO A HEART WITH SOMIN AND AGAIN HER SMILE JUST BLEW ME AWAY. After it I gave BM a little note I wrote where I basically told them thank you and come back, he took it and thanked me but apparently the staff took it away according to the girls behind me. 

After that I stayed a little longer to see them go and they were waving a lot inside of the car (it had tinted windows) and BM used the lantern of his phone and goofed a little with us it was cute.

Now I'm going to talk about the members.

**J.seph**: He's so GOOD I swear. He seems shy and awkward but seriously he slayed in every cover a dope rap verse and he's so good of a performer. I was actually surprised because he was my 'least liked member' but yeah not after today.

**Somin:** CAN I MENTION HER SMILE AGAIN. Seriously she's the definition of stunning in real life, her laugh and way of talking are so cute but then in stage she's so sexy I died at every hair flip and body roll. Also her VOCALS.

**Jiwoo**: She's really shy when it comes to fan interaction and she might not be a perfect technique dancer but seriously her facial expressions and charisma are incredible, she just draws you in. And of course she's ultra pretty I was impressed. And I have to mention every single rap verse she did in the show was amazing.

**BM**: He's seriously a natural performer. He's the nicest and sweetest when it comes to fans and then he's a beast on the stage. He was literally smiling the whole time and it seemed effortless. And he's SO BIG I SWEAR. 

And finally I just wanna say that this went better than expected, it was an incredible experience and apart from a few things (the queue mess and 2 girls fainting), I couldn't have asked for more. I wanna thank MyMusicTaste for bringing them and choosing a great local (the audio and stage were good, it was just small), KARD Spain because even though the queues were a mess without them we could have just lose our place easily and thanks to them we didn't have to stay there all day, the people there because in general everyone was nice and of course KARD for putting on such a great show.

Tbh, I stan DIA more than the other groups and it seems like they are not doing as well as the other groups (their album sales only started to pick up in this recent comeback) despite having rather extensive promotions? (fan meets, meals and games with fans). I remember international fans having a problem with Weki Meki and Pristin's newest songs saying that they are rather disjointed but their album sales seem to be rather high. Why? So what differentiates one group from another if they are all trying so hard to promote?

I recently started writing a monthly K-R&amp;B Picks of the Month blog series for a Toronto-based online magazine called ATK Magazine. That series will take priority for me near the end of each month, but I promise I will always get around to this one!

[Electronic / R&amp;B] [Moon Yirang - Aphasia (feat. Hoody)](https://youtu.be/9f9XmD6kNr8)
&gt;Released on the last day of August, Aphasia is an incredibly groovy and refreshing listen. It is the first track produced by Moon Yirang, a new producer who I think has a LOT of potential.

&gt;The word aphasia means the loss of ability to understand or express speech, usually caused by brain damage. I would like to explain how this word relates to the contents in this song, but I cant seem to do so because I cant find any lyrics. Its still an incredibly relaxing song to listen and bop to regardless. Feature by Hoody, R&amp;B singer signed to Jay Parks label, AOMG.

[R&amp;B / Soul] [Soul Paper - Moon Painting](https://youtu.be/KnBN--aAOl4)
&gt;I really, really like this song. Soul Paper is an indie group who has been around since 2015, but I just discovered them this month.

&gt;Their most recent release, Moon Painting, is a sweet and mellifluous track whose melody and jazz chord progression make it a wonderful listen. Everything complements each other beautifully  the rhythmic drums in the background, the chords interspersed between the melody, and the lovely voice of Lee Hyung-Eun. Altogether, you get a lovely and memorably-produced painting that takes you to the moon and back.

[Electronic] [Glen Check - Mayhem](https://youtu.be/1YSAJdOctJo)
&gt;One of my favorite releases this month, Mayhem is the fourth track off of Glen Checks newest EP, The Glen Check Experience.

&gt;Ive known about Glen Check since 2015 when I discovered their songs [60s Cardin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br1jMFx6Qz0) and [French Virgin Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1XOBNwAHcw)"". Theyre an indie band whose style can be described as eclectic and experimental. Youth is one of the most common themes found in their music, and this theme can be found not only in their older albums (e.g. Haute Couture) but also in The Glen Check Experience.

&gt;The song begins with a choir singing ominously in the background. It picks up pace, though, and by the chorus, the song is in full gear. The incredible melody complements the central message of the song: Theres no rewind, take it slow.

&gt;Definitely my favorite song of the album. Check it out below.

[Dance / Pop] [Sunmi - Gashina](https://youtu.be/ur0hCdne2-s)
&gt;Gashina is the long-awaited return of former Wonder Girls star, Sunmi. With fiery lyrics and an even fiercer expression, she doesnt disappoint.

&gt;Gashina is Sunmis response to a painful lost relationship. She asks, How could you leave someone pretty like me? She then goes on to say how shes the one who has bloomed, while the other is the one who has withered. A powerful comeback, Sunmi is the perfect combination of sexy, charisma and visuals.

[R&amp;B / Soul] [Sanchez - Mesmerised (feat. Yong Jun Hyung)](https://youtu.be/ETTPpWMwY04)
&gt;I cant overstate how much I love this new song by Sanchez. He has always been one of my favorite R&amp;B singers in the Korean music scene, so when I learned that he released his first EP, Colour, I knew I was in for a treat. And I was not disappointed.

&gt;Mesmerized is the 2nd track on Colour. In the song, Sanchez laments a lost love and how hes drunk on the thought of her. He regrets his cowardice, and he promises to be more confident from now on, but in the moment, all he can do is become mesmerized by his memories of her. Its a beautifully sentimental reminiscence  a common theme in most of Sanchezs songs  that fortunately forgoes the sappiness of nostalgia.

&gt;Singer-songwriter Yong Jun Hyung also makes a great rap feature in the middle of the song. Turn on the captions in the video to hear what both these two great artists are saying!

[Special Mention] [Hangzoo, Young B, Hash Swan, Killagramz -  (feat. ZICO, DEAN)](https://youtu.be/4EL_R6_x_u0)
&gt;Finally, we have a dirty hip-hop grime track produced by none other than the FANXY children themselves, ZICO and DEAN.

&gt;This was the first song performed by team CODEAN in Show Me The Money 6. It features an array of powerful and well-known rappers: Hangzoo, Young B (winner of the survival hip-hop TV show High School Rapper), Hash Swan (a contestant who rose to fame shortly after his elimination on Show Me The Money 5) and Killagramz.

Just to summarise, I went to the SM Global Auditions around a month ago and got a callback. Basically what that is is that if the judges liked you enough, they'd bring you to another room where they'll interview you and make you dance/sing etc, again. 


I had to go back to the room a total of 4 times and they made me do a lot of things, and I thought i'd just do an AMA to help anyone who's interested in auditioning for SM and give out some tips because I know I was really nervous and clueless about the entire process before the audition.

649,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-9-8,2017,9,8,12,6ysd1l,self.kpop,Follow-up to September Town Hall - Charts and New Ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6ysd1l/followup_to_september_town_hall_charts_and_new/,SirBuckeye,1504842369,"We want to thank everyone for the great feedback you gave during last week's [Town Hall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6xc9ha/town_hall_september_2017/)  There was a ton of suggestions and new ideas in the comments so we thought we should a quick update on which ideas we'll be implementing and how your feedback will be used.

#### Makestar Roundup

/u/af-fx-tion had a great idea to do a monthly Makestar round-up post.  We gave him the green light and he's already posted [the first one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6xypqc/kpop_monthly_makestar_roundup_september_2017/)  He did a fantastic job, and it's a shining example of what quality high-effort content should look like.  Check it out if you haven't and look forward to the next one.

#### Two Weeks Later

/u/cosilap1998 thought it might be fun to steal a page from /r/hiphopheads and start having a second album discussion thread after the release has been out a while.  You guys are always asking for more in-depth music discussions so this seems like a great way to do that.  So, starting immediately you may post a second album discussion thread **13-17 days** after release.  It should be titled `Artist - Album Name (Two Weeks Later)`.  It should contain a table with all of the information from the original album discussion, a link to that discussion if it exists, plus any chart or sales data that you care to add.  Here's an example thread to act as a template for your future submissions:

&gt; [PRISTIN - SCHXXL OUT (Two Weeks Later)](https://redd.it/6yscth)

Feel free to post updated reviews of the songs, how your opinion has changed since the initial listen, your thoughts on how the song and album are performing in the charts and sales, and how it's comparing to your expectations.  Please try to keep the discussion on the serious side and avoid the stan Twitter catchphrases.  These threads will **NOT** be posted by mods, so it's up to you guys to post threads for your favorite artists if you want to discuss them.  We've made a window of 5 days in case it slips your mind, but once the window is closed, there's no going back.  In fact, there's probably some you could post right now.  What are you waiting for?

#### Charts and Sales Roundup

/u/Galyndean pitched the idea of weekly chart and sales discussions, which also seems like a cool idea.  We've had [similar threads before](https://redd.it/3sxsc2), so it will be nice to bring those back.  Unfortunately, Galyndean is a little short on time so could only commit to doing monthly threads.  That's fine too, but if you're also a fan of talking about charts and sales numbers, maybe you could drop them a PM and offer your services to help out.  Perhaps with a small team we can have them more often than monthly.  These threads will be a great opportunity to see how your favorites are stacking up and discuss which artists are selling more or less than expected.

#### Sales Chart Posts Revisited

During the Town Hall we pitched some new rules for what sales and chart numbers should get their own posts.  We made some oversights in that initial draft and thanks to great feedback from /u/nomoreiloveyous and others, we hope these revisions will be an improvement.

* **No Daily/Weekly/Monthly Chart Posts:** With both the ""Two Weeks Later"" and ""Charts and Sales Roundup"" posts we just discussed, there will be a lot more opportunity to discuss charts and sales.  Therefore, we no longer need to post threads about who is #1 (or any other number) on any daily, weekly or monthly chart.  This includes all Korean charts and international charts except the ones listed below.  These threads will be removed and directed to the roundup post.

* **Exceptions to the above:** There are a few weekly and monthly charts that are still rare enough and newsworthy enough to get a thread.  Those are **Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200, Oricon half-year, Oricon full-year, US iTunes Top 100, Billboard World #1 Only**.  These are chosen because a K-Pop group appearing on these charts is rare and therefore **BIG NEWS**, not because it represents any particular goal or accomplishment.  K-Pop groups are much more common in other charts around the world, so because it happens more often, it is not as big of a news event.  That is the only reason other charts aren't listed.

* **Sales Milestones and Awards:** We will allow posts to be made when a group's album sales hit certain milestones.  The milestones are **50K (First Time Only), 100K (First Time Only), 250K, 500K, and 1M sales**.  These include both total domestic sales from **GaOn** and **Hanteo** as well as Japanese sales from **Oricon**.  Speaking of Japan, the RIAJ also awards certifications for these milestones.  **RIAJ certification** posts will be permitted for all levels.  Lastly GaOn awards a **Triple Crown** award when an artist reaches #1 on the combined digital, combined download, and album charts simultaneously.  These posts will also be allowed.

* **All-Kills and Perfect All-Kills:** These are still permitted just as they always have been.  Only Real-Time All-Kills are forbidden.

Again, we thank you so much for the feedback you gave during the Town Hall.  Your participation in those threads really does guide our policies.  We hope that these changes will sufficiently address the concerns brought up during the Town Hall.  If they don't, please give us additional feedback in the comments and we'll keep working to make it better.

#### Other Ideas

You guys have a lot of great ideas and we want you to act on them!  /u/griffbendor has a great idea for a [""K-Pop Jukebox""](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6xc9ha/town_hall_september_2017/dmf1dvz/) project for instance.  The answer to this and almost ANY high-effort, in-depth, user-created project is yes, yes, a thousand times YES!  If it takes you two hours to compile and it's about K-Pop, then it's almost definitely welcome on /r/kpop.  If you want to be absolutely sure, [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop) with your idea and we'll give you the thumbs-up.  

Reddit is all about users submitting links and creating cool content, so please, feel free to do that on /r/kpop.  In addition to the new features in this post, we have /u/RadAsBadAs doing cool [Nugu Spotlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6wb8tv/nugu_spotlight_13th_to_26th_august/) posts, plus /u/almost_tragic and a small team of helpers making the awesome [Top Ten Tuesdays.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/search?q=self%3A1+title%3A%22Top+Ten+Tuesday%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)  Also, let's not forget the work that /u/Dessidy and /u/tastetherainbeau put in updating the [New Releases Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/2017/september), and the amazing job /u/eunicity does with the [Events Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/events)!  And oh yeah, we have several great users helping out with the [music show](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/music-shows) posts and making killer [Group Spotlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/search?q=self%3A1+title%3A%22Spotlight%22+NOT+%22nugu%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search), so kudos to them, too!  What are **YOU** waiting for?  What's your idea and when will you make it a reality?  We all have a passion for K-Pop, and we can't wait to see what you're going to create for us next!",30,50,False,self,,,,,

~~With his mullet he really reminded me of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Mysterious Skin, but that's more of a hair/face thing rather than an atmosphere/character thing~~

I thought I'll give back to community by translating songs. I know the popular ones gets translated, but not every song does...So.... which comment that gets the most upvote will be translated (top 3)

I'll do more if I can get the time, but three seems like a good number. Please make sure the song you request hasn't been translated or can be found online somewhere.  I will delete the top comment if it is something that I can find within 5 seconds of using google.

I will be back within...3-5 hours to check. Good luck

EDIT: Thanks for the songs. It was good. But this discussion is done as I translated top 3. If yours didn't make it, don't lose hope. I plan on doing this every saturday. For next time...

1. I will make it 24 hours wait period instead of 3-5 hours. So people who aren't checking Reddit often will have a chance to input ideas. Honestly, i thought it wouldn't get this noticed.

2. Yes, given the time frame I have I will only do top 3. But if yours didn't make it, just list it on the comment next discussion. If it appears enough that I start to recognize it in the comment. (like listing that song every discussion for like a month or something) I will translate it for you even it is not the top commented. So keep trying. 

3. lastly, I translate to help you understand the story in poetic form rather than doing the lyrical translation. So of course, take it with a grain of salt and know some words were replaced to make it more transparent. 

4. Even if my I keep doing my youtube channel, I decided to do this every week as a ....token of my appreciation of what kpop has given me. So it will be for the long haul I hope. = )

I've gotten some feedback on the previous post so I have made a quick survey to get other's opinions on these issues. It includes the name and how songs are chosen. Please take the time to fill it out, it would help me out tonnes. 

**[Here is the poll to fill out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFP2P3AR010VfHNzculONY8C-7tNbjkFDSFlyTjC_mrrbirg/viewform?usp=send_form)**

Let's get right to it. Here are the songs released in the last two weeks that have had less than 10 comments on this sub. This is for groups that are nugu on this sub, not in Korea.

If you're a fan of any of these groups/soloists, tell us about them. Why do you like them, who are the members etc.

This was a monster to create, the largest I've done so far. There were 42 comebacks/debuts to be included. 

If there are any issues, there will be a comment that you can reply to.

But I wanted to share my experience and what I took away from the concert.

I'm a long-time VIP and this was special to me.

*****

Two friends and I went to see GD in Houston. By that time, I knew I was going to see Youngbae, but I wanted to know if my friends were just as enthused.

Oh, they were ready. Fast forward to ticketing.  The cheaper, seated seats were all sold out when sales opened and I panicked because I assumed it was all sold out. Turns out the floor tickets were fine! I guess people were that quick or there was some facebook promotion or whatever I didn't know about.


*****

I showed up about 30 minutes before doors opened. The line went from the venue, down the long side of the block, and down two short sides. I didn't even look back as time went by. It was probably down the long side of the second block. Such a mix of people! Concerts are cool like that.

Shoutout to that girl who brought a pizza and a big-ass Coke. 

One of my friends met up with me in line. Other friend met us inside.

*****

So we were as far back as the middle of things, but not quite ""at the front"". We were also off to the right a bit. Thankfully most people were short and weren't blocking my view.

*****

Of course the slightest movement on stage promoted screaming. Stage sweeper, manager guy, whoever. Remember when you were at the school dance and 'everyone's song' came on? That but way louder. Y'all know what it is.

Also: stage sweeper-nim hwaiting!

They play Intro and it kicks off loud. Then he does Ringa Linga and we're shouting, singing, and dancing and jamming. Whole atmosphere was electric. The energy goes up and down to match the set list. We'd sing along when he asked and even when he didn't. Not that we were rude; we just knew the parts.

Youngbae, man. He is something else. 100% in it to win it for **every** song. Extra-ass runs and ad-libs and everything. Smooth and just dialed in no matter what. And this was all live. That's what still wows me. Definitely not as flashy or done up like GD, (I know it's unfair to compare any soloist to another) but *he put on a show*. And I felt it the whole night. The passion he put into his music and my love for hearing his music clicked so much. 

**HE SANG YEOGI BUTEORA YOU BET I WAS RAPPING FOR TOP.**

Solo Last Dance w/ piano was touching. Not too many people were rapping as TOP. I was, and so was the Korean guy next to me. That brought him into the concert. He'd rock out with me after that. 

Of course BIGBANG was mentioned and you bet your ass we ate it up. 

Audience had a lot of love. You know when something is loud, there's something like a rush of air or sound in your inner ear? That was going strong! So glad Youngbae got to experience that. 

*****

I've only been to two k-pop concerts, and it's fitting that they're BB members. 

I'm beyond happy and thankful. This was amazing.

VIP until whenever. VIP forever.",19,63,False,self,,,,,

My friend and I are k-pop fans from San Jose, and when we heard Taeyang was coming, we knew we had to go to his concert. We both bought P1 GA tickets. 

This was both my first concert and my first k-pop concert, so it was super special for me. We got there at around 3:00. By that time, the Platinum line was super long, but we were in front for the P1 GA line. Doors opened at 6:00. However, they were experiencing some delays - I believe they had issues with equipment - so we stood in line inside City National Civic for around one and a half hours until 7:30, when they finally let us in the hall. 

IT WAS CRAZY. We sprinted for the front, and we got to the barricade! Only platinum was in front of us, and we were super close to the stage! We waited for around 30 minutes, then the lights dimmed and IT WAS TAEYANG.

He was absolutely amazing; song after song, he had so much energy. He sang live the entire time and he was PERFECT. During a song (I think Superstar?) he accidentally flipped the mic into his face, but he finished the song professionally. A staff member came to escort his off stage, and we were all asking if he was okay. Then, he came back up and addressed us, telling us it was an accident and he was fine. His English was so good, and of course we all went wild when he talked about BigBang and coming to San Jose for the first time. He kept saying San JOse, with the accent on the Jo, and it was so cute :D

The end was one of my favorite parts. He was so energetic, and the crowd was crazy enthusiastic. I was sad we didn't have that many lightsticks - they didn't sell any at the center and my friend and I were expecting to get some :( However, he interacted A LOT. Someone gave him a flower wreath that he put on for Bang Bang Bang, and someone even gave him a warrior shirt! He put the warrior shirt on and performed with it! The encore was fantastic, he sang Eyes, Nose, Lips, as one of the last songs, and the crowd was basically shouting along all the lyrics. I swear I couldn't even hear him sometimes because we were so loud :)

Truly one of the best experiences of my life. I'm so thankful to be able to attend his concert and to see him in San Jose!",6,63,False,self,,,,,

Hi r/kpop! Heres a new concept for a weekly thread called r/kpop Jukebox, where well get to review songs. Let your ~~wigs be snatched and heads go bald~~ inner critic out and discuss your favorite songs. It appears that a lot users here enjoy writing about and discussing k-pop music but are looking for something more outside of album discussions and MV threads, and I wanted to provide another way for us to take a look at a variety of k-pop songs in the genre. 

*The first thread will be posted this Thursday, unless it is delayed for some unknown reason.* Hope you're excited!

**How It Works**

Every Thursday, I'll provide seven new songs we're going to rate. You will be able to review the songs until the following Thursday, where Ill average the scores and post a representative review for each one (in a wiki, probably). 

1. Each review must come with a score between 1 - 10, inclusive.
2. Every review should be at least 80 words long and provide some sort of insight into the song. Blind stanning and trolling is not allowed, but you are encouraged to be creative and have fun with your review(s). This is not a hard rule: if you can be creative, fun, and substantive in less than 80 words, go for it! (*Note*: Im not going to police your commenting, but if youre going to participate, please say something more than just THIS SONG IS LITERAL PERFECTION. I.e. you can say THIS SONG IS LITERAL PERFECTION and then leave at an 80-word review after that statement explaining why the song is just that, all caps or none at all. After all, the purpose of these threads is to share your own insights and thoughts on the song this week. Have fun, but also remember to review the song! Thanks!)
3. Downvoting someone's comment/rate doesn't change the overall score. I am literally just going to be taking each of the scores you assign and average them, then assign the mean of those ratings to the song. That said, if you want to express your dislike for a song, feel more than free to do so, but please say something more substantiative than ""X song is trash Y artist sucks their music is horrible and idk why ppl listen to them lol"" because these threads really aren't meant for trolling/hating/bashing. You're allowed to express your dislike/distaste for a song (and are encouraged to do so) but don't be extremely flagrant about it. Let's make this a fun experience for everyone!
4. You don't have to review each song! Seven songs + an MV is a lot to write reviews for. Feel free to review as many as you want. 
5. Because I know not everyone likes ballads: each week will alternate between a ballad and a Japanese song from a k-pop group. Tough luck if its a Japanese ballad. 
6. We may/may not also get to do OSTs, k-hiphop songs, and SMTM tracks. Well see.
7. You will get the chance to review an MV each week! The song chosen for MV review that week will be tagged [MV] in front of it; you are encouraged to review both the MV and the music itself. The MV will be chosen from the Month Title Track, Random Jukebox Song (if applicable), Top 10 Artist (if applicable) Song, and K-Pop Button Song and will be generated randomly using random.org. 

Here's an example of a simple but acceptable review, shamelessly stolen from r/popheads first jukebox thread (which they shamelessly stole from ATRL):

&gt; Song Title by Artist is good but has weak spots. I like the instrumental, but the vocals are a bit weak. The production outshines the lyricism in this track. The prechorus melody is really catchy, and the bridge is a nice change of pace. Unfortunately, by the final chorus I was a bit bored. Although this track doesn't have much replay value, it'll be fun to dance to at a party. All in all, I thought this song was decent.

**Feedback**

Okay, so I'm still new to all of this, so I would like feedback on a couple of ~~BLACKPINK in your~~ areas:

* __How would you like B-sides to be handled?__ I made a survey about how people wanted B-sides to be determined/rated on these types of threads and a very sizable majority of the pollers voted for the option: ""More than one B-side from the same artist but different albums."" To accommodate this, I thought of making every thread during the third week to be an ""Artist Spotlight Thread"" where I choose (or randomly generate, more on this later) an artist where three of their B-sides from different albums are chosen to be reviewed, along with other songs from the selection too. However, if this is too similar to Top Ten Tuesdays Threads, please let me know and we won't do this. If you have a suggestion on how to implement this suggestion, please let me know in the comments!
* __Would you rather I pick songs, you pick songs, or they be randomly generated?__ Currently I have like seven different lists to pull from that contain anywhere from thirty-something to hundreds of songs; to pick songs I was just going to put each list in a random.org list generator and the song that pops up at the #1 song would be the song I use from that list for the week. Would you rather be able to pick the songs yourselves, I pick the songs, or something else? Please keep in mind that for some weeks, I won't have enough songs to have seven total songs, and some lists are hard to make (i.e. it's really hard to find a list of k-pop OSTs) so I would just pick a song instead that would be an OST. **--&gt; NOTE:** For the purposes of just starting it off, I'm picking the songs for the upcoming thread. I might do this occasionally if I feel it's appropriate and I have a theme in mind (i.e. I think a ""Summer Songs"" Jukebox thread would be a good way to wrap up the summer songs so far) so I'll choose them that way. But most of them will be randomly generated, unless you would rather I do it this way. __&lt;--__
* __Would you rather I reveal the songs for the upcoming thread before I post it, or reveal it in the post every Thursday?__ I can either reveal the seven songs that day, or I can post them in the actual Jukebox thread themselves. Do you want me to tell you the upcoming list in the next thread, or do you want to just have it revealed live? If you want me to reveal them before I post, let me know and I'll post the first upcoming list in the comments below.
* __How would you like to rate songs?__ On r/popheads, the OP (so me basically) would comment each song in the thread and then all the other users would subsequently reply to that comment with their rating of the song. Alternatively, you could make a list of every single song you're reviewing and leave your review that way like you would for an album discussion thread. Or, if you have a different way you would like songs to be rated, let me know and we can do it that way instead!
* __Do you want me to pick the rate comment that is closest to the average score, pick the rate comment that is the most upvoted, or pick a rate comment at random, or some other way of picking a rate comment?__ With each score a song gets, there'll be one review that is ""representative"" of the overall opinion on the song for r/kpop. How do you want me to pick it? I'm leaning towards the first option but if you have other ideas, suggestions or thoughts on how to do it, let me know!

**Scheduling + Suggestions**

I'll leave what the pre-emptive schedule for these kinds of threads will look like in the comments below. Let me know what you think of the schedule and if you would like it to be different or are fine with how I plan on doing it. Suggestions are welcome!

**Miscellaneous/Other**

There will probably be a wiki page that has an archive of all the songs. A Spotify playlist if I have time, maybe an Apple Music playlist too, but we'll see. I don't know yet. I think adding seven songs to a week to a playlist will be manageable for me though. Also, big thank you to everyone who participated in the surveys with suggestions for B-sides and Japanese/ballad songs! It's been super helpful, y'all rock!

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope you are excited to participate in the r/kpop jukebox threads!",6,44,False,self,,,,,

982,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-9-13,2017,9,13,3,6zozvd,self.kpop,Has knowing/ getting into Kpop change your perception on body image and cyberbully (or bully related to body figure)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6zozvd/has_knowing_getting_into_kpop_change_your/,Wstrtbnker1410,1505242147,"In light of the recent disgusting comments bashing Kyla on [Pann](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2017/09/pann-is-kyla-obligated-to-lose-weight.html) and other Korean discussion sites, I just want to create a discussion about body image and bully related to body figure in general.


Just a little background about me: South East Asian, 20 years old. I listened to kpop very early on and being asian, the body image and definition of beauty was easily impressionable as I could relate to them and look relatively similar to them (being asian in general). When I was about 14-15, I developed huge appetite and my weight went up for a while. While my family did shield me and said that this is the age when I'm growing and developing and that it's fine to put on weight, I have this idea that I have to lose weight. However, I did not follow any dramatic measures like Kpop Idol, I only danced and be more active and control my rice portion. I went down from 57 to 47 kg (sorry don't know how to convert to lbs). Later, I moved to the States to study and learned more about the idea that all body type is beautiful and 'if it's your body, it's your choice. no one should judge you', I gradually moved away from the stick thin ideal of beauty shown by kpop and asian entertainment world in general. I get pissed/ bothered if my relatives say that I got fatter or skinner after one year in the state. I work out and eat well because I WANT to be HEALTHY, not wanting to be stick thin. However, I don't deny that I don't want thinner calves and maybe slim face - some of those obsessions are still there but I try my best to ignore them.

Seeing Kyla being based on by knetz, I can't help but think about korean beauty standards and how easy it is we get away with everything we do on the internet. I get bothered if my relatives talk about my weight or how I look so I can't imagine how I will be so bothered if thousands of strangers internet judge my looks. Furthermore, people can getaway easily with what they say on the internet so sometimes people don't really realize how much of an impact we have on a random stranger, in this case a 15-year-old idol. 

**TLDR: yes, kpop sometimes made me feel like I need to be stick thin but I was able to drive away from that idea gradually. Cyberbully is bad and we get away too easily with what we say about people we don't know on the internet.**

*So, what are your thoughts on this topic?*

* This is the forth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! **Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  

* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 

* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **K-Hiphop**!

* Songs from idol rappers, Korean rappers, or mix tapes are welcome. Keep it at that hip-hop vibe though.

* They can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [Jay Park - Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HFxbY8YvDk)

* [Dumbfounded - Hyung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOxGNh3cwJo)

* [Zico - Bermuda Triangle (Feat. Crush, DEAN)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHoLaLlL5lA)

[K-Hiphop playlist here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdtG-I2dC7MKXZ53FnpvkpP5)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.

* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)

* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

From that, it was suspected that he had lied to his fans about going to the military.  he was far too active on instagram to be in the army which was suspicious at first, then posted photos of him with long hair, then showed up in a youtuber's videos as her boyfriend.

this sparked discussion on an nsonic thread in a forum, which lead to former fans messaging him asking for an explanation.  instead of responding, he blocked the fans and [deleted all of his instagram posts.
](https://www.instagram.com/jay_heartt/)
date whoever you want but did he really need to tell his fans that he was going to the military when he really wasnt? what would he gain from that? plenty of people go on hiatus. its sad for fans but better than a lie.

we're hoping his recent deletion means an apology or explanation is coming soon.

Yuju and Eunha being the main and lead vocal, they usually take up a LOT of the song. This is mirrored in Dreamcatcher with Siyeon and Yoohyeon. 

SinB and JiU are after and then there's a pretty big gap in between singing time for the next members in both groups.

It's pretty unfortunate for people who admire members like Sowon, Gahyeon, and Dami (I feel like Umji and Handong are starting to get a bit more time in for vocals while SuA gets a lot of singing in songs like [Lullaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSq1URfEEC8) and is definitely pushed as the main dancer as seen in [Fly High](https://youtu.be/d7zQOrY2Vj8?t=2m36s) and [Sleep-walking](https://youtu.be/2_GcbZlDnns?t=2m34s)) since they barely get to show their presence on the stage.",27,41,False,self,,,,,

It's also very easy to overlook underrated yet talented groups. Given this, I have built [a website](http://www.hallyuguide.com/) to help combat these problems. With a single click on the ""shuffle"" icon, a random song would be presented to you, so you can discover new artists in seconds.

&amp;nbsp;

Since the website is still in its early stages, there are lots of rooms for improvements and new features to be added. With that said, I am looking forwards to feedback from the community, and I really hope I have made it somewhat easier for people discover new K-Pop music. Don't forget share the site if you enjoy it!

Happy discovery!

Most popular groups have had one choreographer who have really defined their style and/or choreographed their first big hits - Lia Kim/ Twice, Kyle Hanagami/ Red Velvet, Keone Madrid/BTS, Parris Goebel/YG in general, Rino/SHINee, Tony Testa/SM in general but I feel NCT really is Testa through and through because he was with them since they were trainees and Hoshi/Seventeen. A lot of these choreographers have given groups their set styles. My question is, if you could switch around these choreographers, or assign any choreographer of your choice to a specific group to see how they would work together, what would you do?

Personally, I would love to see Hoshi choreograph something for NCT. I know Hoshi is probably only comfortable choreographing for Seventeen because he knows them so well, but I consider NCT and Seventeen dance rivals at this point and it would be fun to see their choreographers exchanged. IMO, Hoshi has a very lyrical style to his choreo and is really able to use the size of his group to his favour with tight formations and the like while NCT is a bit more individualistic and sharp/street in their choreo. It'd be interesting to see how they would do with a Hoshi leading the dance. Similarly, I'd like to see how Seventeen would fare with a Tony Testa choreography.

Edit: It would be pretty cool to see 1 Million's Junsun Yoo choreograph for Oh My Girl lol",23,69,False,self,,,,,

I've followed them ever since before their debut, but I've always kinda been just luke-warm on them. There have been a few moments where a member would catch my eye(D.O. during EXO+TTS cover of DJ Got Us Falling In Love, and Chen when he had that station single featuring Heize), and i did like Lucky One a fair bit. 

But other than those little blips on my meter, I haven't really been excited too much about each EXO comeback.

And then POWER came out last week.

It's not just that I like the song Power, it's that it has completely changed my overall feelings towards the group. I now have like 5 of them fighting for bias status in my mind(D.O. and Chen now have to worry about Xiumin, Chanyeol, and Suho), and I'm reevaluating how I've felt about every one of their past songs. I'm watching through all of their past live stages, and appreciating all of the choreo to previous songs.

So, have any of you guys ever come across a song from a group that changed your whole opinion towards that group?",166,111,False,self,,,,,

1167,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-9-14,2017,9,14,23,702p1x,self.kpop,The P101 business model and how it might affect the future of Kpop,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/702p1x/the_p101_business_model_and_how_it_might_affect/,NudePenguin69,1505400560,"So I was thinking about what P101 has done for Kpop after 2 seasons and it got me thinking if the show concept is actually a sustainable business model over time and what affect it will have on the current Kpop landscape.

So far we have seen that both P101 seasons and the resulting groups have been wildly successful.  It is not unrealistic to think that they will continue new seasons in the future as they are basically just printing money at this point.  If this were to happen, I think that the general business model is actually quite genius and beneficial to the companies that manage the groups, Mnet, and the companies that send their idols.

If they continue to give the resulting groups 2 year contracts, they can have a season of P101 each year, simply switching from guys and girls each season.  This would mean they would always have an active boy and girl group promoting.  When 2 years is up, the old group steps down and the new group debuts.  Here is why I think this is a beneficial arrangement for all parties:

**Benefits to managing companies** - 

*  The resulting groups have been so popular that baring some change in the popularity of the show, each season is basically guaranteed profits for them.

*  They dont have to spend the money to train the idols themselves, thus greatly increasing their profits vs debuting a traditional group.

*  They never have to worry about disbanding groups, military service, members getting old, ect. because the groups only last 2 years by default.

*  Because there are so many companies and so many idols that want to debut, they will never have a lack of willing contestants.  Also, contestants that barely miss the cut 1 year have the chance to come back 2 years later with built in popularity, which gives fans further investment in the show as they might get to see their fav that missed the cut last time win this time.

**Benefits to Mnet**

*  The show is insanely popular, that means big money.

**Benefits to Entertainment Companies that Supply the Idols**

*  If IOI is any indication of how the public responds to past P101 members, when the companies want to debut a group of their own, having a previous P101 group member is built in public popularity to some degree. 

*  Companies get to debut their idols and give them 2 years experience/see if they have what it takes to be an idol, all on the dime of the managing companies rather than risking debuting a group of their own with all rookie members.

*  Because P101 focuses a lot on defining contestants by their companies, constantly mentioning who each contestant is from on the show, its great marketing for smaller companies for virtually no financial cost, other than potentially tying up their idol for 2 years.

**Benefits for the Idol Contestants**

*  Idols would get to debut and experience idol life for 2 years before having to commit to a longer debut from their company.  If an idol feels like they are done after 2 years, then they can walk away.  The show might even be enough for them to not re-debut and go solo in music or variety (See Somi and Chungha).

Now, as to how this could affect the Kpop engine in the future.

If this model proved successful, we might see companies putting their best trainees in the show a few years before they plan to debut them.  This gives them all the benefits I listed above, as well as saving a bit on the costs of trainee fees while they are on the show or in the group.  If this happened, we would see a lot more post-P101 groups like we have this year, which, if we are honest with ourselves, have been the most hyped up debuts so far this year.

The downside to this might be that because the idols from the P101 groups are going to be more popular than their group mates if they re-debut after the show, it could create a lot of ""Suzy and Friends"" groups.  It would really be a challenge for the company to level out the popularity a bit after debut.

1184,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-9-15,2017,9,15,1,703i6t,self.kpop,"Jukebox #1: It's A Sweet Sensation, Oh What a Situation",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/,griffbendor,1505407899,"Hi r/kpop! Welcome to the first official Jukebox thread, where each week you'll get the chance to review seven songs and one MV. Normally the songs will be randomly chosen, but for this week I thought it would be fun if I picked them all based around a certain theme. (Can you guess what it is?)

If you want more info on the logistics of these threads and how I'm randomly picking songs/scheduling these things, you can find all that in the introductory post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6zl99w/rkpop_jukebox_threads_introduction_scheduling/). I will be updating a wiki post later and it'll have all this info on it plus a Spotify playlist and eventually, after the first week, the overall r/kpop rate and a representative review. Just as a reminder:

1. Each review must come with a score between 1 - 10, inclusive.
2. Every review should be at least 80 words long and provide some sort of insight into the song. Blind stanning and trolling is not allowed, but you are encouraged to be creative and have fun with your review(s). This is not a hard rule: if you can be creative, fun, and substantive in less than 80 words, go for it! 
3. Downvoting someone's comment/rate doesn't change the overall score. I am literally just going to be taking each of the scores you assign and average them, then assign the mean of those ratings to the song.
4. You don't have to review each song! Seven songs + an MV is a lot to write reviews for. Feel free to review as many as you want. 
5. You will get the chance to review an MV each week! The song chosen for MV review that week will be tagged [MV] in front of it; you are encouraged to review both the MV and the music itself. 

Here's an example of a simple but acceptable review, shamelessly stolen from r/popheads first jukebox thread (which they shamelessly stole from ATRL):

&gt; Song Title by Artist is good but has weak spots. I like the instrumental, but the vocals are a bit weak. The production outshines the lyricism in this track. The prechorus melody is really catchy, and the bridge is a nice change of pace. Unfortunately, by the final chorus I was a bit bored. Although this track doesn't have much replay value, it'll be fun to dance to at a party. All in all, I thought this song was decent.


So, without further to do, here are this week's songs!

1. [Red Velvet - Red Flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyiIGEHQP8o)
2. [EXO - Touch It ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkcOiwU8mw0)
3. [offonoff - Cigarette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul_OqojSu44)
4. [TWICE - Eyes Eyes Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Irwce1p-wg)
5. [GFriend - Hear The Wind Sing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utJr2v1PeKo)
6. [[MV] Brown Eyed Girls - Sixth Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIqkDBsSJOw)
7. [NCT U - The 7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA)

Please your review as a reply to my comment with the song title. Once again: you can leave as many or as few reviews as you'd like, and you have to include at least some justification with your scores. Please keep in mind that only scores between 1 and 10 are allowed.

Happy reviewing!

Back in 2011/2012, when I was 13, I was REALLY into Kpop. My ultimate bias group was SHINee (it still is lol) and I was super on top of everything. I was around for VIXX's and EXO's debut, I went to the first K-con, I bought a ton of albums, etc. But somewhere down the line, I just kinda fell out of it and my perception of Kpop gradually and drastically changed for the worse. 
As the years went on, all I heard was 'EXO EXO EXO BTS BTS BTS', and frankly, it annoyed me.

I had liked EXO's debut, but the only other song I had heard from them after Mama was fucking Wolf of all things, so that irreparably tarnished my image of EXO for a long long time (which I regret, because now EXO is one of my all time favorite groups).
As for SHINee, the only other song I had heard from them post-Sherlock was Everybody, and as someone who doesn't really like dubstep, it just really disappointed me, and as a result I just started to automatically assume the worst about them, that they don't make good music anymore and that they are 'just as bad as EXO.' (which is funny looking back, because while I still dislike the track Everybody, the Everybody EP is by far my favorite out of all their EP's xD)
And for BTS, I had honestly never heard any of their songs besides Dope, which I didn't like (it reminded me wayy too much of generic American music, especially that sax in the chorus) but frankly, the main thing that had turned me away from BTS was the fandom. I couldn't go anywhere without seeing stuff like 'i love btsss who else is armyyyy hereeee &lt;33' anywhere in Youtube comments, and hearing the countless stories of fanwars and saseang fans did nothing to improve my image of them either. 

So for many years I just lived with this mindset that 'all Kpop sucks now and only the old stuff is good'. But just really recently I decided to go back and listen to SNSD's Genie, which I remember really liking and that just sent me down a rabbit hole of re-discovering and falling in love with Kpop all over again. I went back and listened to all of SHINee's discography (including Jonghyun and Taemin's solo stuff) that I missed out on and I was absolutely blown away (so much so that I actually wrote a nearly 50 page guide/ musical analysis to their entire discography, but that's neither here nor there). 
I also reluctantly decided to give EXO a second chance, but I was equally impressed, and now they're also one of my favorite groups. The same thing also happened with groups like f(x) and VIXX.

But BTS...idk man, I tried. I tried really hard. I'm really thankful I discovered this site because I overcame my prenotion that all ARMY's are annoying and toxic tumblr-infested 12 year old fangirls, because not only is that not true (there are plenty of perfectly rational and normal Army's here) but that is no longer the reason I dislike BTS. The main reason I dislike them now is solely because of their music. 

For some background, the main reason I like and enjoy SHINee, EXO, Red Velvet, Super Junior (mainly their more recent releases), and f(x)'s (practically all of SM actually) music so much is because of the musical complexity present in the compositions.
 I'm a classically trained pianist and violinist (I'll be a freshman in college majoring in piano performance in a couple weeks actually), so to me, the most appealing thing about music is the actual music; the harmonies, rhythms, chord progressions, modulations, melodies, vocal timbre, instrumentation, etc. 

While I was in my Kpop hiatus, all I listened to (excluding Classical Music, which, admittedly, was a huge part of it) was stuff like Kalafina and FictionJunction, groups known for their musical complexity and excellent harmonies, especially live (Cornelius and Maaya Sakamoto are also excellent). 
That's also why I love SHINee, EXO, and all the other groups I previously mentioned; their harmonies, vocals, and everything else is practically top notch and so so so so much better than the simplistic and generic American pop that's getting pumped out daily nowadays. 

But with BTS, I just don't really feel it. Maybe it's just because their agressive, hip-hop/rap, in-your-face type music isn't really my thing (One of my favorite genres is R&amp;B, which is something SHINee (and Jonghyun/Taemin) absolutely excel at. EXO as well, and that's why their Ex'act album is still my favorite, despite it generally being seen as their weakest album), but even with their more pop-oriented stuff, (like Blood, Sweat, and Tears) I just really can't get into it. I'm not a fan of the main singers vocal timbre in that song (the one with the high voice? Jimin? I don't know their names), as well as the very simplistic and minimalistic chorus (similar to Blackpink's Whistle) that's a trademark with many of their singles. It just screams American music to me and has always been something I've disliked. Granted, it's still better than American pop, but not by much.
 
Nothing about their melodies, chord progressions, voices, (especially the voices. I don't really like any of the BTS member's voices, especially the rappers...), instrumentals, stick out to me as especially noteworthy out of any of the songs I've listened to, and I've listened to a lot.

I guess out of everything I've listened to, I've liked House of Cards (there are some kinda cool chord progressions there in the verses), Rain (something about this song sounds like something Jonghyun would compose actually...), and Tomorrow the best, but even then, I still find myself thinking 'I rather be listening to SHINee or EXO right now.' 
I also liked Dead Leaves, but I liked EXO's They Never Know much better (though that's also because I much prefer EXO's vocal line over BTS's. Chen and D.O (also Jonghyun, Taemin, Luna, and Kyuhyun) are some of my all time favorite vocalists in the history of anything ever.) 

I think this is also another reason I much prefer SM's music compared to other groups; while other groups are very obviously making Western-influenced music with their rap/hip hop elements, SM has always focused in on pop music, which I really like. Another thing is that while other companies very much follow the 'style over substance' mindset when it comes to their vocalists technique, SM is an absolute powerhouse in terms of vocal technique and talented vocalists, which I really enjoy and appreciate. Say what you will about SM as a company, but you can't deny that not only do they have some of the best vocalists, but they produce some of best, and most musically complex music out there as well. (Though that last part is kinda subjective lol, but oh well)

Yeah, so I guess that's it. I haven't listened to all of BTS's discography, so if anyone has some recommendations that could possibly get me to change my mind, I'd be glad to hear them. 
Some of my favorite genres are R&amp;B (like I previously mentioned), funk pop (most of SHINee's stuff), and Jazz. I also really like the more experimental stuff, (aka most of f(x)'s discography and stuff like SHINee's 'One Minte Back'). Also, as a lady, I have a soft spot for those more sensual, 'baby-making' type tracks , but I guess that'd also fall under the R&amp;B category haha. 

But basically, I'll like anything, just as long as it's interesting, musically. 

Anyways, thoughts? Hopefully this is an interesting enough topic to garner some interesting responses :)

Doors opened at 7pm, and around 8:15pm, the members of Hyukoh entered the stage to a roaring full house  bass player Lim Dong-gun, guitarist Lim Hyun-jae, Lee In-woo on drums, and frontman and vocalist Oh Hyuk  all donning ridiculously cool, big suits reminiscent of David Byrne. The band has become quite notable for their offbeat fashion, with Oh stating in past interviews that visual aesthetics play a large role in his identity as an artist.

With just a quick greeting from Oh, the band immediately opened the show with upbeat favorites Tokyo Inn, Comes and Goes, and Leather Jacket. Once you get to know their work, youll realize that they dont just make one genre of music. Their catalog stands out through their experiments of mixing different eras of rock, R&amp;B, and soul with an acoustic flair. This, combined with Ohs vocals and poetic diction, creates a retro-eclectic sound unique to Hyukoh.
 
The band played a number of songs from all three of their albums. Notable crowd-favorites included the epic Wanli, TOMBOY, and one of the three encore songs, Wi Ing Wi Ing. During TOMBOY, the audience sang along so enthusiastically that it prompted Oh to stop and film the moment on his phone.
 
In between album tracks, they played their 2015 soft-rock single Panda Bear and rock anthem MASITNONSOUL, which was an original sound track for the Korean remake of the American HBO series, Entourage.

With the exception of Oh, the band members didnt really interact with the audience, choosing instead to focus solely on their musical performance. And even though a trilingual Oh speaks fluent English, he limited his dialogue with the crowd to only a few occasional comments about the song they were about to play  his quiet demeanor an interesting contrast to his eloquent songwriting and often passionately raw vocal performances.

It was an incredible show. The audience included lots of non k-pop fans that were just there for the music. Everyone seemed to enjoy the show.

I recently found out they debuted through the formula of member teasers and a dance visual teaser. There was also that recent show on ABC called ""Boy Band"" where they created a boy band (not a new concept as we've seen group creating shows here like making the band before but still) 

Besides this MTV has recently brought back TRL, which is pretty much the original Music Show honestly, fans used to go for blood to get their fave that #1

Some of my personal examples would be Bae Jinyoung's [part](https://youtu.be/nuzgvsbmMio?t=2m44s) in Oh Little Girl when he sings 'I know you and me', Sungjong's [part](https://youtu.be/Cmhca-ROWwQ?t=2m49s) in The Eye, or even just the exact [moment](https://youtu.be/GWaS65enwpA?t=2m39s) that Yongguk starts rapping over the melody of the chorus. (pardon me if I use incorrect terms, I'm not really knowledgeable about the technical stuff)

But yes!

It seems many new K-pop releases are falling into the tropical, EDM, or R&amp;B (or all three) categories, so I have been making adjustments and updates adding more of these newer songs to the large Spotify list of translated K-pop for those following along. The list has been growing from the last time I posted so the placements are a bit different for some, but for the most part similar sounding songs are grouped together. 

If you have not come across this before, I've compiled a giant list of K-pop on Spotify in which each songs have Korean lyrics and English translations using the Musixmatch mobile app.  The only songs on the list that do not yet have English are the new BTS songs since they were just released (which will most likely change within a few hours given the dedication of many fans).

For anyone wanting to filter through the songs to the category blocks, here's the new order:

Tropical &amp; Dance - G-Soul by ""Tequila"" to ""We Young"" by NCT Dream 
House, EDM, Various Dance -  ""Best of ME"" by BTS to ""Just U"" by Jeong Sewoon
Retro Dance, 80s Pop Style, New Jack Swing - ""Feel Good"" by Shinee to ""Danger"" by Taemin
Experimental/Indie - "" "" by Casker to ""Youth (NIGHT)"" by Oohyo
R&amp;B, Hip hop, Rap - ""Island"" by Primary to """" by Jessi
Ballads, Soft Songs, Acoustic Songs - ""Can't Do This"" by 4Men to ""Nothing without you"" by 10cm
Everything Else - Older pop, Unsorted pop, Brand new unsorted songs from various genres at the bottom

Happy listening.

r/kpop is an amazing community for enjoying and discussing the latest K-Pop news and releases, but there's also a whole lot of K-Pop-related content that doesn't fit in; especially the things that K-Pop fans pour their hearts into creating.  r/kpoppers is focused on you guys, the fans, and what you create and share with the rest of us.  Whether it's a song cover, dance cover, remix, reaction video, compilation video, fan art, fun discussion, or just funny meme or joke, it's all welcome there.  

r/kpoppers is the final piece in our vision for a complete [""K-Pop Ecosystem"" on Reddit.](https://i.imgur.com/EUHaYLK.jpg)  The linked diagram should help clear up what content goes in which sub.  The three main subs, r/kpop, r/kpophelp, and now r/kpoppers are managed by same mod team that you all love ^(*or maybe hate*), so you'll get consistent visual style and moderation across all three subs.  Although r/kpoppers will be more casual, it's not ""Friday-For-All"" every day there.  We have [detailed rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/wiki/rules) and active moderators to enforce them.  Official content that belongs in r/kpop will stay there, questions that go in r/kpophelp will stay there, and group content that belongs in the group subreddits will stay there.  We also have the same great flair and filtering system that we created for r/kpop.  If you don't want to see fan covers, you can just click and hide them, or if you're searching for a certain remix, hit the flair and find all of them in one click.  If you want to see all three subs on one page, this [multi-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop+kpophelp+kpoppers/) is exactly what you need.

You can read more about r/kpoppers content in the [Welcome Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/comments/707hvs/welcome_to_rkpoppers_what_the_heck_is_this/) over there.

### What does this mean for content on r/kpop?

One thing we want to make very clear is that **nothing is changing** on r/kpop outside of just a few fringe post types.  If you like r/kpop the way it is, you have nothing to worry about.  r/kpoppers was created to be a home for content that is already forbidden on r/kpop.  Just to be consistent, we'll be moving multi-group fan-made compilations over to r/kpoppers to join the other fan-made content.  So stuff like the ""Korean Pharmacist"" and any other fan-made compilations will go there now.  Other than that, everything will remain the same with the way we moderate content here on r/kpop.  We don't want to take anything away from r/kpop, and we don't want to force people to visit multiple subreddits to get the content they used to get on one.  If you enjoy fan-made content, then r/kpoppers is for you.  If you don't, you'll still get all the same content you love on r/kpop.

### Isn't this just r/kpopslumberparty?

While a lot of the content is the same, there are some very important differences between r/kpoppers and r/kpopslumberparty (KPS).  The first is that r/kpoppers has well-defined rules and active mods. It's not ""anything goes"", and we will be removing content that is against the rules.  The second big difference is that r/kpoppers is an ""official"" subreddit and will be prominently linked and referenced from r/kpop.  The biggest complaint with KPS was that it was dead.  We're going to do everything we can to make sure r/kpoppers stays alive and well.  Of course this is Reddit, and it requires that users contribute content to subreddits they like.  So if you enjoy dance covers, remixes, memes, and the rest of the content on r/kpoppers, help us keep it alive by subscribing, submitting links, starting discussions, and upvoting posts that you like.  We'll spread the word and make sure everyone knows it exists.

### Questions, comments, suggestions?

Let us know how you feel about the new subreddit, and ask any questions you have.  Go check out r/kpoppers, and if you like what you see, hit the subscribe button and start submitting cool content.  Enjoy!",61,97,False,self,,,,,

Ga-In's [Tinkerbell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3BIQyLqTqI) does something similar, it's usually done to set a surrealist or spooky atmosphere I think.

Have you noticed other songs that do this? Do you like the use of binaural elements in songs?

[Kpop Music Spotlight- SHINee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GpnH2l4YazBVq9AntFUd75DHSzohifJSECW3mH1fzQE/edit?usp=sharing) 

Basically, it's a nearly 50 page analysis to SHINee and their entire discography, as well as a lot of fangirling about the exact reasons I stan SHINee so hard. I wrote it originally for a friend who was just getting into SHINee, so it is obviously geared towards newcomers, but veterans can read it too if they want :) 

Sorry for not formatting this the usual way, but I really didn't want to go back and add all those links...Hopefully it doesn't bother anyone too much.

Though I am a bit peeved that BTS and IU aren't attending, the lineup is solid. Last year's award shows were great but lacking in collabs and such so I would love to see more of that. An obligatory Twice/RV collab would be amazing and I would love a Wanna One/Pentagon collab as they're the only rookie boy groups attending the show. I need something like the iconic NCT/Monsta X, Seventeen/Monsta X stuff that happened earlier. Also, another BG/GG collab like Seventeen/Gfriend would be great.

As for awards predictions, the only one that's set in stone rn is Wanna One's rookie award. I'm not too concerned about who is getting the awards tbh - most awards on Soribada don't have much merit anyway, since Soribada is the least important music provider on iChart rn. For that reason, I also don't think a lot of the groups will actually put much effort into their performances, but I can hope.",29,18,False,self,,,,,

* This is the fifth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! **Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  

* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 

* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Slow Jams**!

* That slow vibe. R&amp;B.

* They can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [Dean - Pour Up (ft. Zico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpX6164uk4)

* [NCT-U - The 7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA)

* [EXO - Sweet Lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGkx8HXzbl4)

[Slow Jams playlist here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdu4uhhIFC3IuocdvzjzWklo)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.

* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)

* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

So, open to all Korean artists, what pairings do you think would be very good?

For IU, I have  this list: 

Dean
ZICO
FT Island
Eddy Kim
Crush
Taeyeon
Akdong Musician (they kinda did already but I hope they will produce something together)
Lee Hi
Beenzino
Busker busker
Epik High
Jung Joonil
MINO
offonoff
Roy Kim

A collab with MINO would be especially unique. I don't know what they would produce but I think their voices would go very well together. 

Also I think Beenzino and Taeyeon would sound great together. ",65,17,False,self,,,,,

I debuted January of this year after 6 years of training. Her title song ""I Wish"" which featured Tiger JK had a good response on music charts (14th on Mnet and 57th on Melon). She was given the nickname ""the 2nd BoA"".

Last week we reviewed seven songs by artists such as Red Velvet, TWICE, offonoff, and more. The reviews were in, and the rankings are completed! You can view them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox). The highest rank song from the first week was **NCT U's 'The 7th Sense!**

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

When I first asked in a poll how people wanted B-sides to be incorporated, a very big majority (over 70% of you actually) voted for the Option More than one B-side from the same artist but different albums. So, per the schedule I had planned, heres your first ever Jukebox Spotlight! And this week, thats right! Its the Wonder Girls, [theyre b-a-c-k back theyre back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IEoulCFwfk) for this weeks Jukebox Thread!

If you were wondering how theyre picked: all the songs are randomly generated, more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6zl99w/rkpop_jukebox_threads_introduction_scheduling/). [Here's screenshots of everything randomly generated](https://imgur.com/a/PX9wU). If youre wondering how Wonder Girls were picked; I took a list of all the Top 10 Thread Artists, and [the Wonder Girls were the first artist to come up](https://i.imgur.com/bQlteaP.png); however, in the future, I would like to just randomly pick one from artists submitted by users (more on that below). 

Just a couple of reminders: Each review must come with a score between 1 - 10, inclusive. Your score should come with a review about 80 words long and provide some sort of insight into the song and your ranking. Its not a hard rule: if you can be creative, fun, and substantive in less than 80 words, go for it! You don't have to review each song, so feel free to review as many as you want. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, then you are encouraged to review both the MV and the music itself (but are in no way required to review the music video if you don't want to). 

So without further ado, here are this weeks songs: 

1. [[MV] IOI - Downpour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AADHVsit4A)
2. [Wonder Girls - Sweet &amp; Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFm_xF0q9Dc)
3. [SEVENTEEN - Say Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYAjuwyib2U)
4. [Wonder Girls - Move (feat. Lee Min Woo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0Jn3ITJglI)
5. [EXO - El Dorado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4z4jEbf6o) ([Chinese ver.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2wfZVcDg0k))
6. [Wonder Girls - Rewind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIzg0YQuyok)
7. [f(x) - Mr. Boogie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuJGlGoN948)

**Also, if you would like to submit artists that are not Top 10 you would like spotlighted, as well as potential B-sides or Japanese songs/ballads, you can submit so here:**

**'Convention' Day 1**

I came down from Brisbane, but I don't think I planned for the convention closing at about 5pm, so I foolishly flew out late and got there at around 4:30. I was really unsure if I was supposed to do anything, so I went inside for a few seconds before being told to go out to sort out my tickets?? I really didn't know what I was doing but I ended up getting my 2 chances for an audience, sadly both came up naught. When I walked back to enter the arena security were sending people away saying it was closed. I decided to wait around then for the concert (bad idea, should have gone to my accom to charge my phone).

**Convention Day 2**

This was kinda disappointing. I got inside at 12pm and the merch line was closed as they were about to be sold out. There was a stand for a cosmetics brand, people could dress up in a hanbok, and a stand for the Korean Cultural Centre in Aus. I got there as the Kpop singing contest started, which I'd applied for but didn't make the final. I thought the finalists would then have been better than me but...idk I don't want to brag but I thought I did much better in my entry than some up on stage. I left pretty quickly

I exited and tried instead to buy a wanna one audience ticket off someone. The hi-touch tickets were selling for $500+, but i managed to find someone on twitter and bought an audience ticket for $100. I then waited for 4 HOURS (about 3 hrs before the scheduled line up time) just to get near the front of the audience, but then found out that the hi-touch people would be in front of us (I thought it was a separate event) and when I got in it was basically us watching wanna one walk in, do the hi-touch and walk out. There was also a lot of Korean girls sneaking in their huge cameras and getting their group of dongsaengs to cover them up from security, which really spoiled the moment as it just added to the already huge amount of pushing and scrambling for a good photo (not that you could with the hi touch people walking in front of wn1). 

Despite this I'm happy my $100 got me a spot 10m away from Ong Seong god forasken Woo. Everyone says he's even more beautiful up close; honestly I thought he was already as beautiful as a person could ever be, and safe to say that is definitely what I saw.

**Concert Day 1**

* The P3/4 lines were hilariously long enough to stretch over to ANZ stadium. I was worried my P3 seat would be too far to the side to see well but I ended up around the same spot as the Platinum ticket holders, only back in the seated area. Great longways view and close to one of the big screens as well.
* Crowd on both nights was NOT full. Both the seating and floor areas were only half full. This was probably the least amount of people EXO have managed to pull for a concert. I blame ticket prices for this, and I hope enough did come for the organisers to consider coming back.
* Kevin Woo from U-KISS was the pre-show host for both nights, there were some amazing kpop cover dance groups performing and I was extremely thankful one of them dance to KARD's Don't Recall.
* OKAY GUYS I want to give another big than you to our sponsor HOTELS COMBINED. WHO WAS THAT AGAIN? HOTELS COMBINED.
* Suho and Sehun as hosts were cute
* So glad that Chanyeol duet came along or I would have never gotten pics of my exo bias.
* What I got most from Pentagon was how short Jinho really is. 
* Shoutout to the fabulous guy in the front who was giving the crowd life with TT during the random play dance
* I've never paid much attention to Girls' Day but damn the crowd was hyped for them. Something especially got huge cheers for the floor move.
* Personally just very happy I got some good shots of my Victon biases (on the screen, was too far away to get a good zoom in shot). I wanted them to perform I'm Fine but seeing Blank live made my day.
* Nothing but praise for the rookies' cover stages. Pentagon covered Hard Carry, SF9 with Monster and Victon with Fire
* EXO, even without D.O. were amazing. seeing Tender Love (thanking chanyeol again for going over to the corner near me and waving to everyone), and THAT choreo for The Eve live was other highlights of the night.

**Concert Day 2**

* Got off to a hilarious start with the first HOTELS COMBINED challenge (show us what you do when you're in a hotel???). Winners tried to um...'dance'...but by thrusting their hips wildly...that'd defintely it, I mean what else do you do in a hotel?. Made even more hilarious by Kevin when he tried to justify that it was 'just dancing' by saying he does that in a hotel too - complete with a demonstration.
* was surprised SF9 performed again, but they performed Roar instead of the B-side?? they did on the first night.
* I got a little bit gayer than I already was from WJSN's Kylie tribute stage. Locomotion AND Can't Get You Outta My Head? That was a real treat specifically for Australian fans.
* Seeing Yeonjung do her longest Bimiliya ever was an experience. Unfortunately no Cheng Xiao (who I was hoping to see) or Bona there tonight. Also glad they performed Catch Me.
* Wanna One was 2nd last, which kinda surprised me but later I realised just how many were there for MX. I honestly don't remember much because 99% of this was me obsessively watching and taking pics/videos of Ong. He goofed off on stage and came and sat over on the edge of side I was closest too so I'm very satisfied. Felt so grateful to see Energetic and Wannabe live.
* Okay, I'm not a big fan of MX but god damn Wonho. Damn his body and damn his genius fanservice. Always teasing and nip flashes galore but by the very end of the night he finally fully unzips his jacket and the abs come out. They also performed 5 songs, the most out of anyone, and still had time for the special event. 
(EDIT: Forgot EXO also performed Heaven so they also had 5 songs.)
I'm not sure how that one girl is still surviving after being called angel by I.M., being sung to by Kihyun and getting a selfie AND major touching with Wonho.

I'd love to hear about everyone else's expereince as well!!",63,50,False,self,,,,,

So I was shocked to find the films main male protagonist, a mentally ill patient at  psychiatric hospital, was played by Rain.

Seeing as mental health is more of a taboo topic in Korean culture, plus teaming up with a director who is always pushing the envelope ... this movie was the last place I'd expect to see such an public friendly idol such as Rain. It was wonderful to see artistic endeavors that went beyond kpop to something that questions social norms. I consider it a pretty subversive and bold artistic/career move (especially considering Rain's extreme fame domestically). Also extremely interesting that a director such as Park would cast someone so visibly and commercially popular. 




Are there any other idols who have made subversive artistic or career choices? Or certain groups or companies? This doesn't necessarily have to leave the kpop scene, a lot of subversive acts exist within kpop, but I'd love to hear other people's findings!",76,132,False,self,,,,,

2032,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-9-24,2017,9,24,5,720vwc,self.kpop,Top punchlines of K-Pop lyrics,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/720vwc/top_punchlines_of_kpop_lyrics/,projectbluefrog88,1506200325,"let me explain punchline. Punchline isnt rhyming because rhyming is easy in Korean. (Korean have 21 vowels instead of 5 like English) or is it about writing something clever (this is given for any rapper). A korean punchline must have dual meaning. Such as.

 I am going to be successful and famous, so that I can get to the pretty BEECHES. 

So is an example of a punchline. Because the word BEECHES can be referred to the ocean or the female derogatory term. This is extremely hard to do in Korean btw. Tablo of (epic high) is current king of punchline, but there are some others as well.....



""like a ttaemiri, clap your hands, I'll **Dijip** over"". Blacknut '100' Ttaemiri is someone who washes your body in korean bath houses.  It is etiquette that when they clap their hands, you are suppose to flip over so the other side can be washed.  dijip means ""flip"" or ""bring it down."" This one actually makes sense in english too. He's saying if you clap hands for him he'll bring the house ""down""(dijip)


""lets go abroad, **Okay nawa**""  swing's 'you look so good to me.' Short and powerful. Okay nawa mean ""okay come out"" but it also pronounces Okinawa a Japanese city. Dual meaning of going abroad in japan, or lets go abroad, come on out. 



""my dream so heavy that I can't **motderu** sleep"" Tablo's supreme 100. motderu means Lift. In English people say i'm ""falling"" to sleep, well in korean people say ""Lifting"" to sleep. He saying he can't sleep because of his dream and also saying he can't lift his dream because its heavy. DOPENESS FROM THE KING




"" If we calculate money I'm the kajoong, but I won't act like a big brother because I am only **maknae** "" Olti's lyric.  Kajoong is the one who makes the most money for the family. Usually the oldest. But he's saying he won't act like that because he's only a maknae (the youngest), but maknae also means ""spending carelessly"" This one is extremely well crafted sentence It puts cultural punch as well describing behavior you need to be maknae but also the one who makes the most money.




just like japanese radish, you guys are **dakkang**. Blacknut.  Apparently there is a Japanese radish brand name dakkang. and dakkang also means da = everybody / kkang = loser. So dissing everyone using pun. genius. pretty clever. I like this one because it can be easily understood using everyday words.


Anybody else have good punchline they wanna share?

If this discussion gets popular I'll upload some more next week. Before the last one got deleted, someone asked me if any idol is known for their punchline. I haven't read a lot of idol music, but there are two individuals that been recognized even by the rapper. I'll try to list them next time. ",22,23,False,self,,,,,

1. Winner's Seunghoon and Seventeen's Hoshi

2. Girls' Generation's Hyoyeon, Red Velvet's Seulgi, Chungha and BlackPink's Lisa
-I think this collaboration would be TOO fierce and their styles would be SO cool to see together.

At first I was really indecisive because the tickets were pretty expensive, I paid 100 for mine, there are so many festivals with top level artists that charge less than that. I have a few friends who listen to kpop but nowhere near enough to justify a 100 so I had to go alone

Anyway I had a two hour nap in the afternoon, woke up just half an hour before doors opened and then got my ass on the train. When I arrived at Wembley Park, the place was just super crowded, but I immediately thought there were waaay too many guys for a kpop concert, turns out there was some NFL game going on. They were walking away from the stadium though, and there were still a lot of dudes walking TO the stadium ""alright I'm not going to be the only guy in there"" I thought.

I search for my seat and my terrified look when I found out it was just behind one of the exits, meaning that I could NEVER even see anything sitting down. Girls started screaming for every single new MV that came on the screen. I asked one of the concert staff if I could sit on the stairs, he said no because fire hazard and then everyone would start doing it. I just sat on empty seats, someone came and took it, went for another seat, repeat, finally found a single empty spot, a bit far away from the stage but atleast not at the top of the venue, I felt bad for people sitting high up there.

Finally concert starts!! He opens up with Heartbreaker. Crowd goes mad. I was hitting myself because I didn't bring my glasses and the seat was too far away from the stage to pay close attention to the choreo. Even when the excitement was high, people around me were just sitting down quietly listening to the music (with the exception of the one girl screaming SARANGHAEEEEEE just 5 seats away). I must say that sitting down really takes away from the experience. The standing section was only half filled and the more expensive sitting seats as well, they should've just upgraded the seating.

He goes into a few of his b-side tracks that I don't really know. Finally he gets back into it with That xx and the all the big MV songs, Crayon, Black, Who You.. were all big hits with a bunch of people singing along. Still I was wishing that I was surrounded by more excited people, at some moments people were jumping on the standing section. 

One of the breaks was pretty interesting, featured several Korean people being interviewed about GD. Whenever some rando goes on the crowd stood quiet, then when some YG artist came on, holy crap the screams. Between PSY, Taeyang and CL, I'm not sure which one got the loudest screaming volume. 

After the break, GD came and spoke with the crowd with his shy-swagness, as someone who was shy the entire life but had to step up with a confident front, even I totally related to his short speech. ""Started from the bottom now we're here!!!"" Same goes for me buddy

One other funny thing was that between all the girly SARANGHAEEEEEEs, OPPAAAAAA and random screams, there was a single shout by a dude, he went ""GDRAGON FIGHTINGGGGG!!!!!"" and actually the crowed cheered the dude's chant.

Finally the last few songs come on, people actually say screw the seats and stand up for Crooked and Untitled, and this was the best part of the concert. But man I felt kinda disappointed that he didn't sing a single BIG BANG song, not even something like Good Boy (my favorite actually). 

On the way to the train I open up a few more people asking about Big Bang songs, pretty much everyone agreed. Still, it was a fantastic evening.

I still feel awesome writing this. I did think the tickets were overpriced and I would've never bought the ticket if I was still a student, BUT it was still worth it.

EDIT: edited out the parts that seemed to have made people mad",19,0,False,self,,,,,

Social media, worldwide prescence and global attention has never been higher than it has been now.  And with this attention comes lots of new, and especially young, fans.  So I wonder what the tastes of the past would compare with today.

For example, as much as I love it, I cannot see too many people taking to that [one boygroup hairstyle that at least one member had from the late 00s-early 10s](https://i.imgur.com/W2i5xcn.jpg). You know the one, Xiumin here demonstrating it beautifully.  They will totally find it ridiculous.  

I've also wondered if SNSD's Gee would still be appreciated by newer fans.  Like, I think a fair amount of people like Cheer Up and that's kind of similar in terms of popularity and impact but would newer fans feel the same

My tl;dr protip for future kcons is just to canvas twitter/facebook sell/swap groups and also to just hang around outside engagements right before they begin because that's when people are happy to get rid of any extra passes for free. 

I'll link my videos here for those of you who don't want to read an entire wall of text: 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SXGNr9kUB4) is a really clear one I took of Rowoon giving me eye contact/hearts and I got Yanan and Kino giving me waves too.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evXFK5qDU0s) is the one I took of Wonho and Jooheon rapping!

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bGxpCd_b58) is a close up of W1 walking in (Daehwi/Daniel waving), HiTouch, Birthday Song

- 

Anyway so just to clear it up, the engagements were all really short, like 15-20 mins max. Kevin Woo was the MC for all of them, and they generally consisted of their intros, one activity and then hi-touch immediately after. I really wanted to go to Girls Day and WJSN but unfortunately the timings just didnt work out. 


**SF9 (Day 1):** The first engagement of KCON AUS at 10:30am. I hung around just before it started since my friends had already gone in when someone randomly pops back out and yells an offer for a free audience pass so you bet I snapped it up immediately. I then accidentally went into the hi-touch line and they forgot to check my ticket so I was able to stand much closer to the front. Hwiyoung (I believe) did 30 push ups for their activity which barely anyone could see because it was on the stage ground and there were no screens... They all spoke in English (Inseong even did a full ment since hes fluent) and seemed cheery enough though, despite looking nervous as hell.



They checked tickets again for the actual hi-touch part so I took this opportunity to move to the left side of the front barricade away from the line up. This was my favorite part because Rowoon ended up giving me tons of eye contact and hearts! Overall, this hi-touch was fairly calm and people seemed to have enough time to say a sentence if they wanted and the boys were returning over the head arm hearts if people shot it to them. Rowoon, Jaeyoon and Inseong stood out to me in particular since they were doing a ton of fan service to my area and were just casually dancing along to the music in between people.



**PENTAGON (Day 1):** We had been unable to find any passes all morning but luckily enough; another friend who had bought a hi-touch pass for $50 messaged us to say she was offered a free audience pass by someone next to her in line. We were also going to buy a pass for $25 when we then managed to get a further 2x audience passes for free from someone on Facebook so all 3 of us were able to go in the end. After meeting up to get the passes, we were one of the last stragglers and so just milled around the back for it. 



This one was busier than SF9 but everyone was pretty chill so I still had a good view from behind the crowd. Their activity was just showing a very short key dance point. I then managed later to be right up to the barricade where they walked out, and Kino gave me a direct wave. Truthfully the boys were a bit stiff and nervous, but they seemed quite stunned with their popularity in AUS. (I understand their fanbase domestically isn't the biggest so I was very happy for them to be so loved here.) Both Yuto and Yanan stood out to me for their visuals and Kino/Jinho were super expressive. Hongseok spoke some english!




**MONSTA X (Day 2):** I was very fortunate to be given a hi-touch pass from u/shinee80862 for free since the one she wanted was w1 and already had that from her P1 ticket. I grabbed it off her around 10:45 am and ended up queuing immediately because a line was already forming. Mind you official queuing wasnt scheduled to begin until 12:15pm. So I ended up waiting in the blazing sun for about 3 hours which was both the worst (almost died of dehydration) and best because I made friends with the girl beside me and she very nicely offered me her wanna one audience pass for free! At this point I was honestly ecstatic because I had already given up going to W1 because hi-touch passes were going for $500+++ and audience for $250+ which is ridiculous imo but that's another story. 

Anyway back to MX, I got to stand front barrier for the hi-touch (thank fucking god after all that). They were absolutely stunning in real life, like nothing you would believe. Changkyun spoke in english thanking us for coming and saying Sydney was beautiful and we were beautiful as well. Hes a grease ball charmer that one. Wonho then rapped (Kihyun said Show me what you got x2 in english to hype him) and then passed over to Jooheon to do his rap as well. Hi-touch for this went by super quickly. I hadnt prepared any comments in particular which was good because I definitely blanked and just thanked them but for my two favorites - Changkyun: I told him to come to New Zealand (where I flew from) and he said hed try haha. Kihyun: I said I really liked his voice and he thanked me. They smelled good, and were taller than I expected. They were also all really bright and radiant (Wonho/Jooheon laughed and smile A TON) and I ended up managing to get into their selfie with the crowd as well. 



**WANNA ONE (Day 2):** I was towards the back of the audience line when I came out from MX but it worked out because when I got inside, I actually stood right where they walked in. I got a wave from Daehwi and Daniel! Being so close to them was an Experience. Event wise though, it was a disappointment because W1 did barely any talking apart from their intros (no activity) and it segued immediately into Hi-Touch. 

The audience was seriously ballistic/crazy the whole time. Lots of shouting, signs, and cameras/arms in the air. There were fan-sites standing on stools and chairs, and I heard people in the center of the crowd were pushing a lot. I just walked up and down the back of the room because my two favourites (Minhyun and Ong) were on opposite ends and just tried to drink in the sight. 

Everyone is right when they say all the boys look WAY better in real life. In particular, I couldnt take my eyes off Minhyun because he was GLOWING. Ong and Jisung had smiles plastered on their faces the whole time. Daniel/Jaehwan/Baejin seemed a bit more stoic, but I wouldnt be surprised if they were exhausted since they flew in from Singapore that morning. The hi-touch was madness. The ushers were practically almost shoving people down the line and from accounts, people said they werent able to get much in. After it wrapped up, we managed to interject and sing Happy Birthday to Guanlin before they were pretty much whisked away again. Overall it was a good experience for me only because I didnt have to pay for an exorbitant amount for the ticket because honestly, it really wouldnt have been worth it.


The convention itself was terrible, the concert was incredible and I had a great if exhausting time. Kudos if you got through all this! ",6,30,False,self,,,,,

* This is the sixth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! 
**Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Summer**!

* Basically any song that has that summer vibe. Tropical.
* They can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [Winner - Really Really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tBnF46ybZk)
* [Sistar - Shake It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9-TIy7WPQI)
* [Zico - Boys And Girls (feat. Babylon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsaJsymfuWU)

Summer playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdtmGQD5duAlxSxr188T83fg)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

I feel like their debut song wasn't the greatest and in the beginning they didn't have much variety show presense. They do have visuals going for them, but Korea doesn't always respond to just visuals. For example, CLC is a group that is full of visuals but Korea barely pays attention to them.

Alternatively, which non-big 3 group would be very popular if they were part of the big 3?",127,39,False,self,,,,,

Today was an absolutely amazing day ! Gugudan came to SG for their first ever fanmeeting outside of Korea. Was able to grab myself the 2nd row at the fanmeet which gave me a spectacular view :) There was so many dan-jjak giving out freebies outside the venue which was very much appreciated !

**Beginning ~**

The fanmeet opened up with 3 songs ! Wonderland , Goodboy and if i was not mistaken Hate You ?  Afterwards it was time for Gugudan's keywords which consisted of describing their albums as a theater , talking about their childhood with their pictures as a child which was just so cute :O and lastly their talents which was mainly aegyo if I was not mistaken. Mina &amp; Hyeyeon also performed Ogu Ogu which the fans chanted along as well ! They also did an acapella of a english song ? Which was also amazing as well. Sejeong also sang Flower's way which just blew me away with her amazing vocals !

 Furthermore there was a design a T-Shirt segment which had 4 teams and Sejeong as the MC ! They played 3 games to determine the props assigned to each team for decoration of the T-Shirt . One of the games was whoever threw the ball furthest into the crowd wins and unfortunately Mina threw and a person from the first row blocked it ! Which sent laughter throughout the theater and Mina squatting on the floor laughing her head off as well :) In the end Soyee's team won the segment because Sejeong just wanted to screw with Mimi as the loser team had to wear their own T-Shirt . Which MiMi's team designed as a ""Sexy"" T-shirt . Unfortunately Sejeong's plan backed fired as the entire crowd chanted Sejeong to wear it as MiMi hinted the crowd to do so . Unfortunately I was not one of the lucky winners of the T-shirt designs which was based on a lucky draw system . There was also a quiz section where lucky fans got to answer a True or False question and if they got it correct they would get a personal selca ! 

**Second part of the performance**

They opened up with A girl like me , Diary , Believe in this moment , Perhaps love . I am probably missing maybe 1-2 more songs here as my memory isn't top notch :( They also came back for an encore with wonderland and threw signed balls out to the crowd! I was fortunate enough to catch Hana's signed ball which just made my day ! They also took multiple fan's phone to take a personal selca as a gift for the fans which i was not able to get one . Afterwards was the hi-touch segment which was just way too fast :( Sally said bye in chinese haha which was so cute :) The group picture was so lucky as I the closest to sejeong &lt;3 and that picture will always be etched in my memory .

**Conclusion**

Had one of the absolute best days in my life . Gugudan was so amazing with their fan service , I had probably every member wave to me once which is such a pleasant memory ! Hyeyeon was exceptionally good at this as she kept waving to fans throughout the fan meet and I was blessed to be waved at multiple times by her hahaha . Sally also spoke in mandarin multiple times throughout the fan meet :) Definitely a fan meet to remember for the rest of my life .

&gt;[+340, -17] Our country has a tendency to ignore groups from smaller agencies. They would rather put the spotlight on lesser talented groups from bigger agencies and put groups from bigger agencies above everyone else. It's just how our music market is geared. Foreign markets like America, however, recognize talent first and that's why BTS is being acknowledged. There are Koreans who don't know who BTS is but there are Americans who are male fans of BTS and copy their clothes and sing their songs. BTS is a lot more popular in America than we could imagine and they're truly helping to spread Korean culture.  

Now I want you to ignore that part about America because that's a different conversation altogether but I wanted to point that first part out  
&gt;Our country has a tendency to ignore groups from smaller agencies. They would rather put the spotlight on lesser talented groups from bigger agencies and put groups from bigger agencies above everyone else. It's just how our music market is geared.    

My question is, does anybody else feel like the idea of a new company rising to the level of the Big 3 is ""threatening""?  From what I've read, there really do exist stans specifically for the Big 3 which I find completely ridiculous but it does bring up the question of underrating or hating on groups solely for getting as big as larger agencies.",83,101,False,self,,,,,

As a Twice stan, Ive heard all the insults from their choreography being too easy to their songs being easy to sing so to hear a judge make such a comment, surprised me.

So, I have a question: what songs do you feel like *seem* hard or easy at first but turn out to be the exact opposite of your original assumption?

For me, Ill stick to what I know, it would be Cheer Up. I always felt the song would be easy to sing and cover but after watching the contestants on [Idol School](https://youtu.be/se1CkBvy5a0) struggle to hit the notes and even Park Jimin saying its a hard song to sing, I now understand why people never really VOCALLY covered the song, its always been dance covers. 

Leave the songs down below and share why!

Edit: Please be aware that Im mainly using Twice as an example as they are my ult group and really the only group I pay attention to outside of music releases. I am encouraging people to speak about their own opinions and groups, NOT just songs related to Twice! Please do not think Im solely here to yap about Twice, I just want opinions!

Kpopper since 2010 here. Way long before liking kpop I listen to Japanese songs, and I speak Japanese too.

Something that I noticed is that, when non-Japanese speaking fans talk about Japanese songs, they'll use the romanized names. People will talk about Utada Hikaru's *Hanataba wo Kimi ni*, but you won't see anyone calling it *A Flower Bouquet for You*.

In kpop it's the opposite, it's hard to see people calling Nine Muses's *   * as *Jameun Anago Baeneun Gopeugo*, people will usually call it *Sleepless Night* or even the more literal *Can't Sleep, I'm Hungry*. In this case the MV on the official channels is written as Sleepless Night, but even when there's only a hangeul name the fans will usually come up with an English translation. Even in kpop Japanese songs it's pretty common to see romanization instead of translation: I've seen AOA's ** being said as both *Ai wo Choudai* or *Give Me Love* pretty evenly.

Why do you guys think this difference came to be?",53,20,False,self,,,,,

So now that it's been a few years, do you reckon its about time a group releases a hit song that takes on the styles of their predecessors which takes them to the limelight?

Feel free to ask about kpop in Korea or military, but no military/politic questions.
***
**Questions most would be curious**


Are you in service right now? - Yes. In Korean Air Force for mandatory 2 year service. Until this November. 


Are they better in person? - YES. At least 10x prettier then any camera can convey.


No fancam. Not allowed to carry a camera or any recording device because they may break security.


It will be broadcasted on Oct 27, I believe.


***
The girls who came were as follows (in order they performed),**SIS, Lipbubble, Kisum, Laboum, Brave Girls, and Seo Mun Tak** (Korean rock singer, you might seen her in 'I am singer')


***
It was held in-doors, a large gym(?) and held a small stage. There were like 500 soldiers and 100 military related families and neighbors.  


I was a bit late, and had to sit on behind, unfortunately. I could still see the stages, but not close as I hoped.


The show started on 19:00, but due to a bit of stage issues (I think) it started a few minutes late.


Male MC showed up and taught some etiquette, such as not to jump on to the stage and dance on the chair, and the crowd, wishing to see the stages asap, followed orders pretty well.


Then female MC (quite pretty) came up and the crowd went wild.  (Forgot the MC's name. Oops.)


After some talking and a short promotional video for military and the company that is sponsoring these mini concerts (called  , roughly translates into 'Cheering Train', I guess?), there was some gas, and crowd was getting wild with anticipation. 


***
**SIS** showed up, and despite them being honestly quite unknown, the crowd was very crazy. (This naturally happens when you put pretty girls in front of soldiers. lol)


First they did a cover of 'Signal' (from Twice), and greeted the crowd, introduced themselves, and then did their own song (debut song), 'I've got a feeling.' 


We chanted along, and to surprise of many, there was 2 crazy stans who visited (I guess they lived near base?) who had big card with the members' name on it and yelled fan chants very, very loudly.



***
**Lipbubble** was next.


First they did SNSD cover medley, greeted the crowd, introduced themselves



Then did their own song, Popcorn. There was surprising many people who knew fanchants and sang along.
***
There was couple of stage soldiers prepared, a hiphop one (I think sthing from SMTM6, not sure) and a ballad one. 
***
Then **Kisum** showed up, and the the crowd was loudest here. Almost deafening. So much I couldn't hear the song well. ( ??), then she did Like It, No Jam, and Super Star. (not sure on her song names, not much of hiphop listener)


And the crowd was crazy each and every song. She sometimes threw water to the crowd, and couple of times ran into seats, making the crowd even more wild.
***
**Laboum** was next, and there was definitely some 'stans' here and there because of fan chants and shouting out member names and stuff.


A bit surprised to hear all members getting pretty equal loud upon introduction, but then we were almost always in top volume. 


They first did Only U, and then asked for what songs to perform. Then upon requests, they performed HwiHwi, Love Arrow and Shooting Love.
***
There was couple of band from soldiers. One had a violin and one had three guitars.


Then there was some talent show off contest (if you can call it that,) to get signed SIS albums.
***
**Brave Girls**. The are one of new 'army prez' for a reason. *Thighs. So glorious....*


They performed High Heel, Easily.


Then the *chairs* appeared and crowd was wild.


At last, the stage I was most looking for today, Rollin was on. And it was glorious.


***
Then for last, **Seo Mun Tak** was on. Don't know her songs much, unfortunately. But she was great singer.


She is a rock singer that used to be popular couple decades ago, so the crowd was a bit mixed on her stages. Some rock enthusiasts were most crazy this day, running to front of stage and jumping up and down, while some just stayed in their chairs and awkwardly watched not sure when to be excited.
***

Sorry for a bit messy post, but I wrote this down asap to keep my memory fresh.

There was an artist spotlight on the Wonder Girls, along with songs from SEVENTEEN, f(x), and more. Thanks to everyone who participated. You can view the results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox). The highest rated song from Jukebox #2 was **EXO's El Dorado!**

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/71kfu6/jukebox_2_were_back/)

Alright, now let's get down into this week's songs! (although some of these should be fairly obvious from the title)

1. [MV] [Luna - Free Somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwG8f9nt4s)
2. [LOO Odd Eye Circle - Girl Front](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyInv6RWL0Q)
3. [BTS - Dope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM)
4. [Oh My Girl - Closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk)
5. [Ailee - I Will Go To You Like The First Snow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By8Iv_TpxCI) (Goblin OST)
6. [SHINee - Feel Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtHTeF3Pn8k)
7. [Pentagon - Its Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy5zjZq3fJU)

Just a couple of reminders: Each review must come with a score between 1 - 10, inclusive. Your score should come with a review about 80 words long and provide some sort of insight into the song and your ranking. Its not a hard rule: if you can be creative, fun, and substantive in less than 80 words, go for it! You don't have to review each song, so feel free to review as many as you want. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, then you are encouraged to review both the MV and the music itself (but are in no way required to review the music video if you don't want to).

**NOTE**: I do not personally pick these songs. With the exception of Ailee's OST, which I picked since this week I scheduled it to include an OST, the rest of the songs were all randomly picked using a generator. Screenshots of everything are [here](https://imgur.com/a/sI7vz).

If you would still like to submit B-sides, Japanese songs, or ballads, I'll keep taking submissions until I think there are too many. So, I'm still accepting! Wanna submit? Here are the forms:

Morgan Stanley acquires stake in JYP
 
""It is widely speculated that high anticipations for girl band Twices new song release is the main reason behind this move.

In light of foreign investors bullish run, JYP stocks have climbed 99.5 percent this year, reaching a record high of 10,350 won on Sept. 26.

In the first half of this year, JYP posted sales of 50.4 billion won (US$43.80 million) with operating profit of 10.7 billion, which is a 74.4 percent rise in sales and 138.7% percent increase in operating profit.""

 
Once an institutional investor buys &gt;5% stocks of a company, it has to declare to the stock exchange that it has become a substantial shareholder.  Other institutional investors are likely going to take a closer look too.
 
Apparently Morgan Stanley is now the no.3 largest shareholders in JYPE and the largest foreign shareholder.",69,305,False,self,,,,,
