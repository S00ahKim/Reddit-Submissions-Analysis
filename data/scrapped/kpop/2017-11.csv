* This is the eleventh installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! 
**Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Solo Artists**!

* Indie music is basically music that was produced independently without the help of major record labels. But it can also describe a genre of music.
(I'm sorry. I actually don't know much about indie music so I hope you guys can shed some light on the genre!)

Indie playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdtgpmkd_Vj9XqXduyeZYrLP)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

###Intro

Position: Lead Vocalist

Prior to her debut with SISTAR, Soyou was a trainee under Cube Entertainment and set to debut with the members of 4MINUTE. However, due to some issues, she did not make the cut as Cube said she was lacking. Soyou then auditioned for Starship where she debuted as a member of SISTAR.

After her debut, Soyou sang OST's when she was still a rookie. She sang ""Should I Confess"" which was the OST for *Playful Kiss*. In 2012, she sang ""Officially Missing You"" with the duo Geeks. The song immediately became a major hit. In 2013, she guested on *Happy Together* with Dasom and revealed her concerns about being the least popular member. In the same year, she released ""Stupid In Love"" with label mate Mad Clown. The song earned Soyou her first #1 single, her first solo music show win outside of SISTAR, and recognition for her soothing yet emotional vocals. The following year, she released ""Some"" with label mate Junggigo. ""Some"" became extremely popular and hit the Melon roof more than 40 times, which is incredibly rare. ""Some"" solidified Soyou's position to be dubbed as the ""Queen Of Collaboration."" ""Some"" is regarded as one of kpop's most successful songs as it hit more than 100 million streams in the year it was released, sold more than 2 million and it was the only song that did in 2014. It also earned Soyou 11 music show wins. After Soyou's success with ""Some,"" she released a song with Urban Zakapa titled ""The Space Between."" It became an instant hit too, and earned a perfect all-kill on charts. In 2015, Soyou became the MC of *Get It Beauty.* Soyou then released her new collaboration with Kwon Jeongyeol, titled ""Lean On Me."" But during promotions of ""Lean On Me,"" she suffered a herniated disk which resulted in her ending promotions early, and it caused her to not be able to film the last episode of *Get It Beauty.* Bora replaced her as the MC for the last episode. As a MC, Soyou provided extremely helpful tips to the viewers which garnered praise.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Group Fancams

Fancams have come a long way in the last few years as cameras have gotten better and professional fancammers have improved their techniques.  Fancams have always been allowed on r/kpop as long as they follow a few rules.  Those rules haven't been written down before, so we're going to do that now.  Here are the existing rules for posting fancams:

1.  Fancam must be of the entire group, not specific members.
2.  It must be of high quality.  High quality means very little or no ""shaky cam"", from a good angle and distance, and recorded in HD, preferably at least 1080p.  Here's a [good example of what we mean.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEWG6WuhXsE)  And here's an [example of what is **not** allowed (headphone warning).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbSp_6OTaA)
3.  No official video of the performance exists.  Official video is always preferred over fancams.
4.  The performance should be unique or special in some way.  For example, a song or cover that the group has never performed live before, new and unique choreography, or some other unique event like a malfunction, special guest, or falling 8 times in the rain.

These are the rules we've been following for some time now, but we want to get your feedback specifically about rule #4.  Is it necessary?  We could remove that requirement and replace it with ""One post per group per event"" instead.  This would allow users to post fancams of ""regular songs"" that are done at various festivals and events nearly every day that don't normally get seen on r/kpop.  Groups often perform older songs and perform out of their normal promotional cycle.  For example, [EXID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQlfynAHLk0), [KARD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xUyx8o63SU), [Oh My Girl](https://youtu.be/5V0V_ftqw4E?t=240), and [Blackpink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT0ETTMGnC4) have all had live performances in the past few days.  Would you like to see high quality fancams like these here on r/kpop?  Of course, this would mean a significant increase in live performance videos.  So the real question is, do you want to see more live performances, or are you happy with the amount we have now?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Translating Articles Revisited

We talked last month about translations, but we'd like to get your feedback again.  It's important that the English translations posted to r/kpop are accurate and complete with the necessary context.  One idea we'd like to consider is creating an ""Approved Translator"" list.  Basically, anyone could apply to be on the list and we'd give them a quick ""Translation proficiency test"" of some sort.  If they pass, then they can post Korean articles with translations in the comments.  Users who aren't on the approved list can only post English articles.  We feel like this would help ensure that translations posted to r/kpop meet the accuracy standards we have.  Unfortunately, it also adds another layer of bureaucracy and barrier for participation, so we want to hear what you guys think about it before moving forward.  Do you think an ""Approved Translator"" list is a good idea, or is it unnecessary?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Non-Group-Specific Newsworthiness

The current rule that forbids ""non-newsworthy or fluff articles"" falls under the Group-Specific Content section of the rules.  That means that as long as the article is about multiple groups, then it's fine, even if it's super fluffy or mundane.  Would you like us to expand the newsworthiness check to [submissions such as this](https://redd.it/79kpp1), or do you want to continue seeing posts like that on r/kpop?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Feature Flair

We've added a new flair choice for submissions called Feature.  We will use this flair for the amazing user-generated projects that you guys are working on like Top Ten Tuesdays, the Jukebox, Playlist Project, Artist Spotlights, Nugu Spotlight, and anything else you come up with.  Up until now we've been using the Discussion flair, but it just never felt like it fit quite right for these posts.  The Feature flair is colored yellow and categorized with Discussions for search and filtering in the sidebar.

&amp;nbsp;

#### The Report Button

We'd like to remind everyone that the Report button on posts is to notify mods of rule violations.  Please do not use the report button as a ""super downvote"" button.  We've noticed a recent increase in reports on obviously permitted posts like music videos, teasers, and variety.  If this continues, we may have to alter automoderator's rules to be more relaxed, which will mean that real spam and reposts will stay up much longer instead of being removed quickly by the bot.  We may also ask the Reddit site admins to look into the reports and punish repeat offenders.  Do not report posts just because you don't like the group or the user who submitted it.  Doing this will only make the subreddit worse for everyone in the long run.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Census 2017 Closed

Thank you to everyone who participated in the census this year.  The form is now closed.  We will post the results as soon as this Town Hall is over if not sooner.  We want to do a little formatting of the data to make it look nice and then we'll post it up in a couple days.  Thanks again!

&amp;nbsp;


#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",76,36

206,2017-11-03,2017,11,3,1,7acjc8,Reddit K-Pop Census Results 2017,SirBuckeye,1509638989,"Thank you to everyone who particpated in the census this year.  We know you are all eager to see the results, so here they are.

### [Imgur Album of Results](https://imgur.com/a/ZEDUx)

### [Google Forms Results *](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Tc7IgXKJmnFZCJ4p1dF2rNtRzGBervj5zyYAfwkKbQA/viewanalytics)
&gt; ^* ^There ^seems ^to ^be ^bug ^on ^Google ^Forms ^that ^sometimes ^causes ^the ^responses ^number ^to ^double.  ^So ^if ^you ^see ^10K+ ^responses, ^refresh ^the ^page.

#### Breakdown and Comparison

* **Responses** - We had a total of 5054 responses this year which is down from 6465 responses last year.  The census was posted later in the year and we juggled the sticky status on and off to try and fit in as many user features as we could.  Last year it was stickied for four straight weeks.  These two factors may have contributed to the decline in responses.

* **Age** - The 18-24 group stayed almost exactly the same, however 25-34 increased while 13-17 decreased compared to last year.  This follows a similar trend from year before last as well.

* **Gender** - The girls have finally taken over.  This year we have reached 50% female and 48.1% male.  Last year we had 42.6% female and 56% male.  Reddit in general is still overwhelmingly male, so it's great that we have such an even split in our community.

* **Sexuality** - We got a little more gay.  Straight users are down from 75.8% to 70.3% while Bisexual increased from 10.6% to 15.1%.  

* **Relationship Status** - How you doin'?  Single number stayed basically the same at around 80%.  All other categories were also pretty much the same as last year.

* **Employment Status** - Not much change here from last year.  Employed numbers are up a couple percent while Unemployed Students went down a couple.

* **Location** - American responses dropped from 49.3% to 45.2%  Other areas remained about the same.

* **Ethnicity** - While Caucasian and Asian are still the two largest demographics by far, both categories saw big reductions.  Caucasians dropped from 44.5% to 39.3% and Asians dropped from 46% to 38.9%.  The big gainer this year was Mixed Race with nearly 7% reporting.  Last year there was a lot of various fill-in-the-blank answers on this question so getting rid of those seems to have unified everyone who identifies as Mixed.

* **How Do You Obtain K-Pop Music?** - Free Streaming increased from 75% to 84.3%.  Physical Albums also increased by about 8 percentage points.  Digital Downloads and Piracy both saw reductions.  Paid Downloads were nearly cut in half as streaming has really taken off this year.  Paid streaming was a new category this year.

* **How Were You First Exposed to K-Pop?** - Results here are very similar to last year.  Still Friends/Family leading the way with Browsing YouTube second.

* **How Long Have You Been Listening to K-Pop?** - Newbies less than a year are down from 14% to 9.8%.  Old timers reporting more than 10 years went up a couple percent.  The rest of the categories are similar.

* **Do You Know Korean?** - We're learning!  Users who know very little or no Korean dropped from 88% to 74%  The categories were simplified for this question this year so the comparison isn't direct, but keep learning!

* **Are You / Do You Want To Learn Korean?** - This is a new question this year and it looks like most of you are still hoping to get around to learning Korean ""someday"".  52% said they want to learn, but haven't taken it seriously yet.  Might as well make today the day to start!

* **Where Do You Get Your K-Pop News?**  - Shockingly most of you (93%) get your news right here on r/kpop.  Twitter was a big winner being up 11% from last year while AllKpop fell about 6%.  Other big gainers this year are Instagram and YouTube as news sources.

* **How Often Do you Visit r/kpop?** - Multiple times per day visitors are down a bit from 53% last year to 48.5% this year, but it seems they are still checking the site at least once a day as that group rose about 6%.  The other groups are all about the same.

* **Favorite Group** - BTS has overtaken Red Velvet as the most popular group on the subreddit this year with nearly 38% choosing them.  They also almost doubled up EXO, the next closest boy group.  Your Top Ten Groups are:

&gt; 1. BTS
2. Red Velvet
3. Twice
4. Blackpink
5. SNSD
6. EXO
7. Big Bang
8. SHINee
9. f(x)
10. Seventeen

* **Favorite Soloist** - IU leads the way on soloists with 33%, but Taeyeon isn't far behind at 27%.  Your Top Ten Soloists are:

&gt; 1. IU
2. Kim Taeyeon (SNSD)
3. G-Dragon (Big Bang)
4. Dean
5. Ailee
6. Agust D (Suga) (BTS)
7. Heize
8. Jay Park
9. Zico
10. Sunmi (Wonder Girls)

**2013** [MBLAQ - Smoky Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTDmIiGLFEw). To this day, I think this song was ""ahead of its time."" Over a year before, This Is War did so good too. The timing for this was pretty sad.

**2014** [KARA - Mamma Mia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tK0XUQQ3wA). They were past their peak, but I wanted Mamma Mia to be another hit song and more than a Show Champion win. CMIIW, but was Pandora their last really popular one?

**2015** [9MUSES - Hurt Locker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sna6j078eOw). The lineup here did so much. 3 comebacks in 1 year as a senior group, with Hurt Locker being a summer anthem... Not even a win :( I believe Drama even did better. A lot of girl groups made a comeback that summer though.

**2016** [JUN. K - THINK ABOUT YOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL7RncKzMSg). Hardly any recognition both in Korea and internationally. This was his first Korean album too. Sometimes you see it around this subreddit when future bass is mentioned . Dude is a genius for this song.

**2017** [Brave Girls - Rollin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeaoaAz0VbY). For Brave Girls, I at least wanted Rollin' to be popular enough where a couple variety shows would notice and have them guest. Not that it matters much, but even a couple million more YT views would make me feel a bit better lmao.",268,213

Some songs they've covered: [/a/ sings This Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rFuzy0CNpU) from No Game No Life and [/r/anime sings Colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3Ng1vJt0_M) from Code Geass.

I recently came across kpop randomly on youtube and I must confess I really enjoyed it. So much so that i've decided not to explore more of the kpop world (I've 10 BTS songs on my playlist and one of Blackpink). I fear that my I'm slowly turning into a stan and it will somehow affect my masculinity. Tbh I refuse to blast kpop in my uni room like I would for other type of music.



I'm of Asian descent and can be easily mistaken for a korean so I guess it won't be ruled as cultural obsession (Nothing wrong with that, I just feel like it's weirdly seen for guys) but I do live in a western country where kpop ain't a thing.



Any guys here from a place where kpop isn't really popular ? If so, are you ""public"" about it ? ",34,0

Well, for me at least, November signals ~~   Radio~~ the real return of the autumn season, especially with the changes in Daylight Savings Time and the days getting shorter! Goodbye Summer. Featuring D.O. (If you dont get these references I apologize, also no there's no Pink Tape on this weeks Jukebox, Im sorry). 

Anywho, last week was a spooky jukebox! Artists featured included some Wonder Girls, f(x), TWICE, and more! For the first time ever, *we had not one but TWO songs* get an overall mean score of over a 9! Yep, thats right. It was basically...SHINee vs SHINee haha. The highest rated song of last week was **SHINees Sherlock** with the (currently) __highest ever score of 9.10!__ It was followed closely by Married to the Music with a score of 9.04.

Hey! What you talking about? Please dont break my heart, oh

Hey, I dont think you understand 

That I dont like that

3,2,1  __HIT IT!__



Here are this weeks autumnal songs!

1. [SISTAR - I Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJVUjmNMF8c)
2. [ASTRO - Crazy Sexy Cool ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeUx0AN2kCA)
3. [BTS - Autumn Leaves ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJokL8rUXQM)
4. [MV] [BESTie - Excuse Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuVi2ib-0qQ)
5. [Wheein - Shadow (Yellow OST Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj5zLSX8OII) 
6. [VIXX - Black Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsEX-7XFe0E)
7. [Ladies Code - The Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsx9f8tdifw)

I know you already know how this works if youve been doing this for awhile BUT! In case you dont and are brand new, heres how it works: I comment the artist and name of the songs, and you leave your review as a reply to my comment. You then leave (about) an ~80-word review leaving your comments and an overall score for the song between 1 to 10. You get to pick how many songs you want to review  you can review only one or all seven! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, its also cool for you to review the MV too  but you are in no way obligated/required to do so. 

Like I say each week, **I dont choose most of the songs for the Jukebox.** Except the OST, which I picked because I dont have a way to randomly generate OSTs. But everything else was randomly picked. Ill provide screenshots later in the comments, Im a bit on a time crunch right now but I cant, I apologize!

[View the full chart here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_the_jukebox_chart_-_the_top_10_songs)

After having a good month at the #1 spot on the charts, Oh My Girl was knocked off by SHINee. But never fear, Closer is still in the Top 3! But yeah, SHINee really is dominating the ratings right now  so far theyre the only group who have had multiple songs on the Jukebox where each one has charted high and are all ranked above an 8.00. If youre weary of them and this chart becoming a Top 10 SHINee Songs fest, dont worry  because I featured two SHINee songs last week, theyre blocked from Jukeboxes for two weeks; any songs randomly generated are omitted and not considered viable for the Jukebox of the week.

We have the year end top 10, but how about revisiting them all together instead of searching for the old threads. And cmiiw, I believe the old threads go back to only around 2012. I also feel this gives a chance to people who got into kpop later, but have checked out past songs to talk about them. Hopefully you can give a reason or a comment on some of your songs. You can go back as far as you want.

&amp;nbsp;

**2016:**

1. [SISTAR - I Like That](https://youtu.be/LJVUjmNMF8c) | *Dark Sistar made a reappearance. Bora killed it with such a short rap. Dasom's solo part and then her sultry lines (the one where her leg is exposed while the curtain goes down) were breathtaking.*

2. [Brave Girls - Deepened](https://youtu.be/TsD79puVGRI) | *Out of nowhere after years they made a comeback. Hyeran's rap was really impressive.*

**2015:**

1. [2PM - My House](https://youtu.be/u2pFB1dCSo4) | *This song is amazing with a great pair of speakers. The intro is one the best I've heard. Jun. K really shines in this song, especially with the acoustic guitar. Not to mention he produced it, a genius.*

2. [MBLAQ - MIRROR](https://youtu.be/2HbSXxHClWI) | *The last MBLAQ song as of now, and it didn't disappoint me. Words can't explain how much I miss G.O's vocals.*

4. [9MUSES - Hurt Locker](https://youtu.be/sna6j078eOw)

6. [SUPER JUNIOR - Magic](https://youtu.be/xMZ5nK5G71o) | *Personally, a lot of SJ's title tracks are polarizing to me. But I really eased up to their 2014-2015 stuff a lot.*

7. [Soyou X Kwon Jeongyeol - Lean on me](https://youtu.be/zgVHtDY24t8) | *A definition of ""coffee music,"" and I love it.*

10. [PRIMARY - Don't Be Shy (Feat. ChoA, IRON](https://youtu.be/G9zL-A78oRg) | *ChoA singing to this reggae song is stunning. Admittedly IRON's rap fits well too. And of course, PRIMARY is a genuis.*

*Honorable Mentions:* Kim Sung Kyu - Alive &amp; f(x) - 4 Walls

**2014:** Musically, this year was really good..

1. [SISTAR - I Swear](https://youtu.be/ktEEjk3Xy3s)

2. [KARA - Mamma Mia](https://youtu.be/AEAdE9wSqwg) | *KARA killed it in this song, despite losing 2 members with importance in vocals.*

3. [2PM - GO CRAZY!](https://youtu.be/uwD51VS0Uko) | *I remember some people being disappointed with this song since ADTOY was just a year before. But I wasn't at all. The song gave for some hilarious and entertaining live stages.*

**2013:**

1. [2PM - A.D.T.O.Y.](https://youtu.be/AFnV7Y6iwrA) | *If you're known as beastly-dols, this is how you comeback. One of, if not my favorite work of JYP. I don't mind the distorted voice in the song too. Nichkhun's falsetto's though lol.*

2. [SISTAR - Give It To Me](https://youtu.be/p6XLNsJ9YrA) | *Phenomenal song (and era). The heavy burlesque sound was great. Line distribution is meh, but Dasom kills with her 1 ""actual"" line. Bora's rap always fits well, despite being short. Soyou and especially Hyolyn goes off in the chorus beautifully as usual.*

3. [MBLAQ - Smoky Girl](https://youtu.be/dTDmIiGLFEw) | *""Ahead of it's time!"" J Tune got an incredible lineup to work on this song and the members executed it wonderfully. It's too bad it didn't do so hot...*

2. [SISTAR19 - Ma Boy](https://youtu.be/X6XXia5B2Wg) | *I don't need the empowerment/message of the song, but you'll catch me singing the chorus with some body rolls. How can you not is my question.*

3. [MBLAQ - CRY](https://youtu.be/3UggIMs8pdE) | *I remember reading something along the lines of ""it's hard to find the emotion in a kpop song like Cry nowadays."" And I agree.*

4. [KARA - STEP](https://youtu.be/zYoYoBtLqOY)

5. [MBLAQ - MONA LISA](https://youtu.be/SenkemTrZMQ)

Cinematic not just in terms of cinematography and visuals, but also in having a cohesive plot with a beginning, middle, and end. I find that most groups these days think 'story' MVs are a chance for them to be as cryptic as possible and leave the audience 1000% bewildered. While those MVs are nice, I'd like more full-scope movie MVs with actual cohesive storylines.

Does anyone have an recommendations?",94,78

445,2017-11-05,2017,11,5,21,7axc2f,MIX9 EP. 2 HIGHLIGHTS,gills__,1509885678,"I was making individual updates for each highlight from the show but figured it'd be annoying and I could just put together one single post for anyone interested in discussing the ones that are getting attention from the show - since I've noticed that a lot of people take this sub as their news source.

The good:

 A.C.E's audition: Their group audition was actually the best out of the auditions so far. Judges were impressed with them and they trended on Korean social media sites post broadcast. Donghun joined the debut bus. Also YG told WOW that he's handsome lol.

 Sori from CocoSori's audition: CocoSori trended #1 and Sori trended #2 on Naver search rankings. Her audition clip is garnering positive responses. YG told her that she did a good job and also released her audition song officially on Melon.

 24K's audition: Unfortunately didn't go that well until member Kim Jinhong started showing his individual charms. Very akin to WINNER member Lee Seunghoon's Kpop Star antics. YG and Zion.T couldn't stop laughing and Jinhong got to enter the debut bus! Chansun's voice was liked by both YG and Zion.T despite the group's shaky performance and he eventually lands at #24 during the showcase. YG really really liked the leader Cory, even hugged him and called him the 24K's dad. 24K also trended at #1 on NAVER.

 ONF's audition: Went well. YG liked it but wasn't expressing much. He said Hyojin reminded him of Se7en's early days and let out a smile at J-US' performance. Both made it to debut bus!

 R.G.P: (creep alert) Basically member Yukika's cuteness had the judges floored. It was awkward to watch but she did well and all R.G.P members seem to have passed the auditions.

 RBW Trainees' auditions: 11 OF THEM PASSED!!!! But YG has favourites - Kim Youngseo who was #4 in the showcase and Gunmin who YG thinks has innate talent.

The Bad:

 CocoSori - YG let her know that 28 is the age where most idols' careers expire but she just debuted. Though she did redeem herself!

 24K's auditions: Their group audition didn't go well and their voices were shaking. But some members made it!

 LOONA's auditions: What we were all dying to know. There were high expectations but their auditions didn't go well. They underperformed heavily out of nervousness and each of the members got criticised. I think theirs was the most harsh feedback. Hyunjin and Heejin passed the auditions though!

-Kim Seungmin from Mystic Ent.: His dance was...something. In YG's words ""it was a mess.""


The Best:

-YG hit his head and almost fell backwards at A.C.E's agency.

-YG was pissed when JYP was criticising YG male trainees in next week's preview.

-YG's face when he asked A.C.E where the other 2 members were and they replied that 'they went to another show.'

-JTBC uploaded A.C.E's audition clip on NAVER TV and added in the title that the other two trainees went to 'The Un*t' (R.I.P)

I'll keep updating this post when I receive new updates and I'll add links in a while.

I'm going to make a playlist out of this. I'm Indian so I do this majorly with sentimental Bollywood songs but I want some kpop recs. too so please leave yours away.

The only kpop songs currently on my playlist:

 Goblin OST - And I'm Here, I Miss You.
 BIGBANG - Haru Haru, Blue, If You, Last Dance.
 2NE1 - Come Back Home (Unplugged Ver.), Lonely.
 WINNER - Baby Baby, Empty
 Zion.T - Yanghwa BRDG
 Heize - You, Clouds, Rain
 IU - Through The Night
 NCT U - Without You
 Tablo - Bad
 Epik High - Home Is Far Away, Spoiler, Love Story, Umbrella
 BEAST/HIGHLIGHT - Fiction, Ribbon
 GD - Untitled, 2014
 AKMU - Melted, Last Goodbye
 Lee Hi - Breathe
 Urban Zapaka - I Dont Like You
 iKon - Apology
 BTS - Spring Day, Run, Awake (Jin)

Ik its a long list but I'm tired of most of these and need new recommendations. Songs like BIGBANG's Loser are what I would consider Power Ballads or Lit ballads since they actually make me want to dance lol.",183,178

SHINee and f(x) have always had funky and experimental dance songs. Red Velvet has had some trippy and unconventional releases, as well, but their dual concepts of Red and Velvet make them unique. Super Junior and SoShi's songs usually fall within the realms of dance pop and bubblegum pop. I don't follow TVXQ very closely, but it seems like their focus on EDM and jazz pop differentiate them from SJ. NCT 127 has tackled hard-hitting hip hop tracks, while EXO does dance pop that is tinged with R&amp;B and hip hop.

When can we expect celebs, like Siwon and Onew, to come back on the air after a scandal?",filamjam,1509988780,"I got into K-pop only in the past year, so this concept of a media blackout after a scandal for celebrities is fairly new to me--it doesn't usually happen in the US unless the scandal involves something really serious, such as allegations of sexually harassing underage boys and being investigated by Interpol at the same time ([see Kevin Spacey](http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/netflix-fires-kevin-spacey-from-house-of-cards-1202607002/)) . . . and even then it's usually the celeb's choice in order to not make their situation any messier. However, in Korea, it seems like drunk driving--something that doesn't even make the daily mainstream news in the US, and is of interest only to TMZ--is something that can get a celeb kicked off a show ([see Noh Hong Chul](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/11/infinity-challenge-discusses-noh-hong-chuls-drunk-driving-incident-broadcasts-his-parts)).

&amp;nbsp;

I'm curious how long these media blackouts usually last in Korea?

&amp;nbsp;

When can we reasonably expect the likes of Choi Siwon (Super Junior) and Onew (SHINee) to be active and on the air again?
I think it's fair to say that Siwon and Onew's scandals **aren't** worthy of lifetime media blackouts. It has to end at some point. I'm actually surprised that Onew is still pretty much non-existent in the media.

&amp;nbsp;

Do we know if these blackouts are voluntary, imposed by the celeb's agency, imposed by the media companies, or is it simply expected by the government?",48,24

But I get it, in kpop everything is always really exciting and gets praised into the mighty heavens. However, I experience the ""snatched my wig"" feeling when I hear a song for the first time very rarely. You know, when you actually drop your jaw and are completely speechless by how good it is? The song doesn't need any warming up to like it, it sits PERFECTLY in your ears right upon first listen, and you know within the first 3 seconds of the beginning that this is going to be your jam for eternity. 

So far I've only had this experience with:
BTS' ""Mic Drop""
EXO-CBX's ""Hey Mama!""
SeoHyun's ""Bad Love""

**Currently Active Projects:** (in order based on project end date - given in KST)
	

**[Real Smell Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_realsmell/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 9, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Real Smell?

Real Smell is a solo artist (signer/songwriter) signed to MAPCREW, who debuted in 2013 in the band Common Ground, a [Korean Funk Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIH6BJe32IY). This project is a collaboration between Makestar and Voicecovery, but beyond that I haven't been able to find anything else about him - at least not in English.

**[Apple.B Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_appleb/)**

*  Date Project End: November 13, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Apple.B?

Apple.B is a very new group, having debuted August 1, 2017 with the song [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivFyyllBSE)"". Like B.I.G, they are also signed to GH Entertainment. The group consists of 5 members, and seems to be going with a cheerleading style concept if their Makestar page is any indication. Besides their personality quirks and basic info on each member (the standard age, position, blood type), nothing else of note has really been written about them in English.


**[EXID 5th Anniversary Photobook](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_exid/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 13, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is EXID?

[Relevent Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXID), but short version: (due to pretty much everyone on the sub knowing who EXID is) EXID is a 5 member girl group who initially debuted in 2012 to lackluster success. It wasn't until a fancam of member Hani performing their single ""Up and Down"" in 2014 that made the group go viral, giving the group the big break they needed.


**[P.O.P New Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_pop/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 20, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is P.O.P?

P.O.P is also a very new girl group, having debuted July 26 with the song [Catch You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZM7mmDKQQ). The group has currently has five members (though they debuted with 6) and is signed to DWM Entertainment Company. The group is co-managed by Rainbow Bridge Works, the label of Mamamoo and Vromance. Member Yeonha, who entered a hiatus shortly after the group debuted, [officially left the group on October 24](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/78c1v0/pops_yeonha_will_be_leaving_the_group_in_regards/) due to continuing health problems. Although not much has been written about them in English, they have an active [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQ_3LxyLJ8Z9C5s1GdlF4g/videos?pbjreload=10). 

**[Juniel Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_juniel/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 20, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Juniel?

Juniel is a signer-songwriter currently signed to C9 Entertainment. From 2011 to 2016, she was signed to FNC Entertainment (the home of AOA and CNBlue). Funnily enough, she actually debuted in Japan first like BoA did, releasing her first mini *Ready Go* in the country on April 29, 2011. She would eventually debut in Korea in 2012 with the song [Illa Illa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDp1bzjC4t8). The song would later be popularly used as the theme song for character Im Mae-ari (Yoon Jini) in the drama *A Gentleman's Dignity*. Her other notable release was the song Love Falls in 2013, which was a collaborative Christmas single with CNBlues Jonghyun.

Though shes never been able to top the Gaon singles charts, most of her title tracks have entered the top 40, with her highest charting single being 2012s [Bad Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSBH8BNwpPs) which comes from her album *1&amp;1*.

For more information about her, check out her [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniel) page.

**[Soo 1st Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_soo/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 20, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Soo?

Soo, also active under the stage name Kisu, is a member of the k-pop group 24K. He is currently signed to Choeun Entertainment. Soo has been a member of 24K since the groups debut in 2012, and is considered one of the groups sub vocalists. This sub mostly knows them from their 2016 song ""[BINGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEOo_zSAXxw)"" which was the title track from their album *The Real One*.

Contrary to the bad boy image 24K has been pushing as of late, Soo seems to be wanting to showcase his boyfriend charms for his 1st solo album.

Most recently, he and the remaining members of 24K (which just underwent a contentious lineup change) auditioned to be on YGs survival show Mix9. Based on this [tweet](https://twitter.com/mix9_official/status/914150496922828801) it seems he was ranked 91 in the initial episodes.

Not much else has been written about him in English, but he does have an active [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/24k_7s/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/24k_7s?lang=en).

**[The Rose Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 21, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is The Rose?

The Rose is a 4 male rock band from J&amp;Star Entertainment. Also a relatively new group, they debuted on August 3 with the single [Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXcpLWB2eBA)"". According to OneHallyu, the group writes, composes, and arranges their own songs. The groups name is said to come from the idea that there are many different color roses, so the group wants to be like a rose and show off many different musical colors. The fandom name is Black Rose.

While I couldnt verify the information, the info section of the groups OH thread says that Doojoon, Jaehyeong, and Hajoon met via busking (they started performing under the name Windfall), and Woosung was offered the chance to join by Doojoon due to hearing about his music skills via a mutual friend. Funnily enough, Woosung was a trainee at J&amp;Star preparing for a solo debut, but brought up the band concept to the labels CEO, and after a successful performance by the 4 members, the CEO signed the remaining 3 and formed The Rose.

They have an active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bandtherose/) page.


**[Marmello Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_marmello/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 27, 2017

The group is a 5 member female band, who is signed to  Rolling CultureOne. They debuted in May 2017 with the single ""[Puppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjIQP56CxU)"" and just recently released their second single ""[Can't Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-iPoUI47xs)"".

**[Eve Remake Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_eve/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 27, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Eve?

Eve is a Gen 1 male Korean rock band that has been active since 1997. They are signed to MCC Entertainment, and currently have 4 members. While there has been various lineup changes since the groups inception, the current lineup has all the original founding members. The group is known for being one of the first Korean bands to use the visual rock/glam concept. The group has most recently released a collab track with Super Juniors Heechul (called ""[Melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8m_Jo44dg)"") and performed on Immortal Songs on the March 11th episode.

**[Snuper 2nd Anniversary Photobook Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_snuper/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 27, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Snuper?

Snuper (which stands for Higher than Super) is a k-pop group signed to Widmay Entertainment. The group consists of six members, and debuted in 2015 with the song [Shall We Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB6eX7Lc2CY). 

Not much else has been written about them in English outside of the standard age, blood types, etc, but the group is actually Widmays first k-pop group ever. Theyve also slowly been gaining a fanbase, going from 823+ albums sold (Gaon) for their first mini to selling 50,000+ combined for their most recent release and repackage (Gaon).

They do have a sparse [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuper) page as well.

* Date Project Ends: November 27, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Kim Sohee?

Kim Sohee is a singer signed to The Music Works, which is the performance division of CJ E&amp;M. Not to be confused with Elris Kim Sohee, this Kim Sohee came to prominence due to her appearance on *Produce 101*, where she ended up ranking 15th in the final episode. On the show, her most notable performance was in the song [At the Same Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1NbzOE4HTQ)"" on Team Girls on Top which included future IOI members Doyeon, Sohye, and Yeonjung and future April member Chaekyung. Sohee would later debut in the project group IBI and C.I.V.A (a group created via the mockumentary show God of Music 2). She also appeared as a special MC for episode 5 of *Broduce 101.*

She has a sparse [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_So-hee_(singer,_born_1995\)) page as well.

Rui is Japanese, and she is the rapper and visual in H.U.B. Not too much has been written about both the group and Rui in English, but she had her solo debut in August 2016 with the single [Exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQQULifcnY&amp;pbjreload=10), won Gold in the 60m Track Champion of the Idol Star Athletics Championships (2017 Lunar New Year Special), and was Maxim Koreas cover girl in September 2017.

**[015B Remake Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_015b/)**

* Date Project Ends: December 21, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is 015B?

015B is a Gen 1 duo (formerly a group) signed to MCC Entertainment. Not much as been written about them in English, but they initially debuted in 1990 as an actual band with 4 members. However, the group seems to have disbanded in 1996. In 2006, the group was revived via two of the founding members, and has promoted as a duo under the groups name ever since. Most of their current work features guest vocalists. 

**[S.I.S Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sis/)**

* Date Project Ends: December 28, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is S.I.S?

So there actually isnt too much written about them in English, but [relevant wikia](http://kpop.wikia.com/wiki/S.I.S) page.

From what little I could gleam from the internet, S.I.S (which stands for Serendipity in Stars) is a six member girl group signed to XX Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Ive Got a Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwx68Z99uk)"". According to their Makestar, the groups image is going for a little sister vibe.

They do have a pretty active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sis6girls/) page.


**[14U New Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_14u/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is 14U?

14U (pronounced One For You) is a 14 member boy group from BG Entertainment. The group is actually made up in two subunits (think EXO K/M), one being 14U-X (the ""masculine charisma"" subunit) and 14U-L (the ""cute friendly charms"" subunit) with 7 members in each subunit - though they are currently promoting as a whole team. The group debuted in July with the song ""[VVV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b83iEHH_UTU),"" but were soon dragged into a controversy when member Doyool was falsely accused of ""dissing"" Kyungsoo of EXO. It was soon revealed that this post was actually from an impersonator account and BG is currently taking legal action against the impersonator.

**[April Special Photobook Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_april/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is April?

April is a group who is decently known on the sub, so Ill link the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_(band\)) page if you guys want more info.

But short version is: April is a six-member group group that is signed to DSP Media (former home to KARA, Sechskies, and Rainbow and current home to KARD and A-Jax). The group debuted in  2015 with the song [Dream Candy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2T1yZbTMzo) and has sort of become known more because of their member changes than their actual music. 

Former member Somin debuted in DSPs Japanese group Puretty in 2012 with future April member Chaekyung, but the group disbanded in 2014. Both girls (along with debuting April member Chaewon) later participated in the *KARA Project* when KARA was undergoing a lineup change, though they did not win the slot (Heo Youngji did).  Somin left April soon after the group debuted, and would eventually re-debut in the co-ed group KARD. Former member Hyunjoo left a year into the groups debut due to health issues, and is currently appearing on the survival show *The Unit.* 

Before joining April, current member Chaekyung appeared on *Produce 101* after not winning the KARA slot, eventually placing 16th in the show. On the show, her most notable performance was in the song [At the Same Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1NbzOE4HTQ)"" on Team Girls on Top which included future IOI members Doyeon, Sohye, and Yeonjung and future soloist Kim Sohee. She would later debut with Kim Sohee in the project groups IBI and C.I.V.A.

The most notorious former member of April was Sawori. For a time, she was the most popular member of the group, but then it got revealed that not only did she have an [iljin past](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/05/29/saworis-rise-to-stardom-has-led-to-special-treatment-her-iljin-attitudes-exposed/) but her diva-like attitude caused her to [be bullied](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/05/31/shocking-video-of-sawori-being-bullied-by-april-members-revealed/) by the other April members. She left the group soon after the group's promotions for *Spring* ended.

Their current image is essentially like a young Apink. The groups most notable songs include [April Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWRyggt-QY), [Lovesick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWkkcRpLam0)"", and [Jelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHVtMV6XpQE)"".

**[We Girls Debut Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_wegirls/)**

* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is We Girls?

I literally have not been able to find anything in English about this group outside of their Makestar page. They have an active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wegirls7) page though.

From what I could take from their Makestar, We Girls is a nine member group signed to Aftermoon co. From what someone posted on the sub, one of the members Ji Na (written as Jaina on the Makestar page), is a former member of Bob Girls. 

Doing something completely different from other debut projects, Aftermoon is allowing Starmakers to vote on who becomes the groups center and leader. As of November 6, member Vivian is winning though Jaina is close behind.

Because I know in which direction these sorts of threats tend to go I'll give a warning right before we start: 

!KEEP IT CIVIL! 

don't turn into a pack of wolves with some of your opinions! This thread is not an outlet for you to degrade or madmouth idols so stuff like ""xyz is so ugly/ I hate them/ they're so overrated"" will not be tolerated. It's possible to have an unpopular opinion without having to be a douche about it.

Have fun! :)",1612,152

* This is the twelfth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! 
**Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Non-Korean**!

* Any language.
* The song can't be a second version of an already existing Korean song. It has to be exclusive to that language.
* Can be by any idol. (Chinese, Thai, American etc.)
* Can also be by ex idols and soloists.

Here are my contributions -

* [Dean - I'm Not Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzvRxguTPa4) (English)
* [CNBLUE - SHAKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjc7VQW42pU) (Japanese)
* [Daesung - Shut Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hLcIfdoIz0) (Japanese)

Non-Korean playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdv__0vgpbdrqluXDn0th3Gy)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

699,2017-11-08,2017,11,8,15,7bjjm5,Idols from current generation with solo potential,gills__,1510122154,"This year has all been about solos in kpop for me which is why every time I've been looking at new and old groups I like, I've been trying to find the solo potential.

Unfortunately, I don't see a lot of it overall and nothing that holds a candle to currently established solo acts like GD, CL, Taeyeon or Sunmi. Here are the ones I do see potential in:

 RV's Wendy: I can't quite predict her musical style but I just see a lot of belting in her solo work already.

 BP's Jennie: I personally find her be the only one from the new gen. to have the charisma that it takes to go solo and own it. She's a pleasure to watch on the stage. Her singing, rapping and confidence is fire. CL and GD 2.0 indeed but I'm here for it.

 BP's Ros: That girl has her eyes set on an acoustic solo and you can smell it from miles away. I def. get the TSwift of Kpop vibe from her and I'm not complaining.

 TWICE: This has been my complaint with JYP for quite some time now. Regardless of arguments about their talents, they're a terrific group but I dont see ANY solo potential in any of the members. Fans have pointed at Jihyo, Nayeon and Momo's singing and dancing talents but none of them are groundbreaking or novel in kpop...they're just the standard...The only one I currently see having the slightest of potential is Mina - I think her elegance is def. fresh in the kpop scene and she has a very pleasant vocal tone as well.

 BTS - Suga's more or less gone solo already so aside from his, I'd say Jimin. He def. has a strong stage persona to go solo. He reminds me of Taemin that way.

 NCT's Mark: Been vouching ever since his rap break in the 7th sense.

 WINNER: I mean 3/5 of them were solo to begin with. Even though that ratio is down to 2/4, the versatility that Mino and KSY alone have showed has been stupid impressive and Jinwoo is just waiting to be used/explored more. He has such a sweet voice, it'd be perfect for sort of a male SoYou. I think he would've been so good for the male parts in 'You, Clouds and Rain' or 'Call You Bae.' I think Seunghoon doesn't want a solo career in music.

 iKon: Besides B.I and Bobby, Donghyuk and Junhoe. I think Donghyuk's vocals and dancing are too underrated but one listen to him in 'Secret' on Love &amp; Fall would make you want more content from him. He sounds really sweet but sexy? Kinda like Justin Timberlake. And Junhoe's voice is sex and the world deserves a Junhoe solo.

Do you agree with me? Do you disagree with me? What other idols do you find to have to lot of potential from the groups I did and didn't mention? I'd love to know!",114,72

So, like the title says, what are some praises that you want to throw out there to show some appreciation for groups that you don't stan? I'll start with a couple of my own:

* I'm not really into boy groups, but there are a few that I love simply due to their personalities and variety prowess. Shout out to SHINee and BtoB for making me laugh every single time I see them on a variety show. Also, kudos to Taemin for killing it with Move. 

* Although I don't know much about them other than a few title tracks (this might be changing soon), I love that CLC is incredibly versatile and able to pull off different concepts for each comeback. Constantly changing concepts isn't always necessary or always a good thing, but CLC does it well and I hope that they get more love in the future. 


Edit: For those thanking me for making this thread, I thank you for responding. We all love kpop, so lets love/respect each other as well. ! ",113,162

950,2017-11-11,2017,11,11,5,7c3xra,New Releases Spotify Playlists,Dessidy,1510347481,"Hi!  
I am u/Dessidy, or [newkpop](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop) on spotify. I am responsible for linking all new releases in the super amazing [Upcoming Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/2017/november) wiki page with their spotify pages!  
Before I started collabing with tastetherainbeau for Upcoming Releases, I ran my own ""this week in spotify"" series. Back then I always linked my playlist in my posts, but since the combination with Upcoming Releases I haven't found a place to put them.  
Therefore, some of you might not be aware of that Upcoming Releases are linked with spotify playlists. So this post is to share these playlists again!  
(Maybe also a slight celebration since r/kpop's [Kpop Girl Groups](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/3V1Z7NTCogFnmd5cA27Ly0) playlist hit 20k followers this week!)  
  
The playlists:

* **[2017: Kpop Releases](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/6JSC32coktmA3wKgfvqM4b)** If you are only going to follow one of my playlists, this is the one. If a new kpop release is on spotify, it will be in this playlists. This includes full albums and releases in other languages (Japanese, Chinese, English...)  
* **[2017: Kpop Releases (Singles &amp; Promoted Tracks Only)](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/741hvmfhKbgFc8OIyLNyr7)** If every single track sounds a bit too much, then this playlist is for you. Here, only title tracks and promoted singles are included, making it a bit more easy to listen to.  
* **[2017: K-Hiphop/R&amp;B Releases](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/3GzFoZP7CPsyM5sub5g0Yx)** Interested in other genres than just kpop? This playlist includes most k-hiphop/R&amp;B releases on spotify.  
* **[2017: K-Indie/Folk/Rock/Electronic Releases](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/5cg4HrdYe36sexqmOeINqa)** Similar to the playlist above, this playlist is mostly indie, rather than kpop (but there might be some indie kpop too).  
* **[2017: Korean OST Releases](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/407H1YxndC2W4Dw6E1mesa)** K-Drama fan? Look no further, this list includes most new OSTs available on spotify.  
* **[2017: K-Ballad Releases](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/78kmf0bwVWTCDfRGjLGrZo)** Do you like Korean ballads? Then this playlist is for you! If that chart-topping ballad is on spotify, it is in this playlist.  
  
I also have a few curated playlists:  
  
* **[Kpop Monday Mix](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/6LWP7xy66ow9hdzPaSp6KL)** Updated every 14 days (on Mondays) with 25 new songs. Mostly kpop, but a few other Korean releases are mixed in too.  
* **[Fresh K-Indie Finds](https://open.spotify.com/user/newkpop/playlist/2vHPYersUVfhRaXsFcEiFV)** Updated regularly as I find new indie songs I like. This is my personal pick of the newly released indie/non-mainstream Korean music.

Saw a lot of comments on various videos as I was checking them out to watch el dorado. For some reason, I never did until a week ago. Now, I feel like instead of wasting my time re-watching their performance live for the past week, I should've done this months ago. 

Another song would probably BTS - Dope when I first got into kpop and my friend recommended this to me. I'm still not fully into BTS but after getting into kpop, Dope was a song that made me regret not getting into kpop earlier. The choreography, the music, everything about that song basically made me have to check out BTS everytime they released something new. 

So yeah, was just wondering what song do you guys regret not listening to earlier from any group? ",126,85

YG: 2NE1 or Black Pink were still significant explosions of Kpop. However, looking at the number of  boy groups, the frequency and details of their promotion plans, we can easily see that male artists are more favored and those boy groups promoted by YG hardly failed. 

JYP: It might be quiteunlucky to boy groups, but honestly, the boss was too good at promoting his beloved daughters.

SM: SM's boygroups are often booming and longer than the girlgroup.

And for those who still are in a time zone where it's Saturday, its 11/11! And literally 11:11 AM in my time zone haha, Make a wish! ^^ ^^ Im posting this a bit earlier than I normally would, hope thats okay! 

Last week we had BTS, BESTie, and more on the Jukebox! The highest rated song from last week (and of all time!) was **SISTARs I Like That** with a score of __9.35!__ Congrats SISTAR! To celebrate, the Spotify Playlist and Best of Playlist have been updated with SISTAR fanart! (More on this in the Other Business section)

To see last weeks results, [please click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_last_week.2019s_results). The full results/rankings/reviews are right below that under the Full Rankings section!

Its 11:11, and this week's Jukebox is my kinda Wonderland! Here are this weeks songs!

1. [Taeyeon - 11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulr0muQKjk0)
2. [Jessica - Wonderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4kTwN_w4jk)
3. [Zion.T - The Bad Guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p3jqlRK4Do)
4. [LOO Odd Eye Circle - Sweet Crazy Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG7FkoNKBzI)

6. [MV] [JJ Project - Tomorrow, Today (, )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktdqlQ1zhg4)
7. [Dreamcatcher - Chase Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zihoyz0u_cs)

(Edit: fixed this formatting, sorry about that! Also added the MV tag)

~~Yes I intentionally put Taeyeon and Jessica next to each other on the list of songs~~

I say this every week, but theres always new people who come to the Jukebox threads, so here we go again! To leave a review, reply to the comment that has the song and title in it. Feel free to review all seven of the songs, or just one of them, with a ranking of the song overall thats between 1 and 10! As a gentle reminder, downvoting someones review *does not* affect the score, as Ive said before Im literally just taking all your scores and averaging them to get the mean score. And, like always, __I dont pick the songs!__ I picked 11:11 and Wonderland since I get to pick a song this week, but the rest of those were all randomly generated using random.org/lists. You can leave reviews throughout the entire week: I start calculating usually on Fridays/Saturdays but _you're allowed to submit your reviews and scores up to 11:59 pm PST the Friday before the next Jukebox._ Edit: Also, if a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can review the MV as well! That's optional though, totally up to you.

Lots of new songs came on this week! In fact last week, 5/7 of the songs were overall an 8.00 or higher, which is the most thats happened ever! Astro broke the Top 10! Oh My Girl still hanging around in the Top 5, and meanwhile SISTAR has surpassed SHINee and taken the #1 spot! I suspect it will stay there for awhile, but who knows!

Thats all for now! As per usual, Ill leave everything else to the Other Business Section, but thats it! Do you wanna make a wish this 11:11? Do you feel like cotton candy   fantasy? Do you want Dreamcatcher to Chase You? Maybe tomorrow? Or how about today? Does this make Dreamcatcher the Bad Guys? Find out and listen to this weeks songs! Thanks for participating, have fun reviewing, and (if youre like me) hope youre enjoying your (three-day) weekend!

When in a normal state of mind (95% of the time), i find K-pop absolutely unappealing, obnoxious and just plane stupid. I question why i got into it in the first place. The artist's are fake, most of the music is medicore at best, they speak in a language i don't understand...

However, when i'm in a sadden/depressed mood, i follow K-pop almost religiously. The things that bugged me about K-pop, are now the things that i love about it. I fall in love with the groups and members, watch loads of variety shows, listen to my favorite songs. 

It may be some type of escapism, since the the culture and language is so alien to me. Everything in the industry is crafted to perfection. So when in vulnerable state, your easily captivated by it.",20,0

I think every nugu group fan has atleast considered the reasons for their favourite groups lack of popularity and pinned it down to atleast to one or two factors. Nugu group fans, what's stopping them from being successful? Can anything be done to help them? Do you think they'll ever be successful?

What are the characteristic sounds, melodies, genres of your favorite group(s)? What kinds of things, if heard, would make you recognize a song's artist on the spot? 

I'll start off- MAMAMOO is known for their funky and vocally-oriented songs. Some trademarks I'd point to are [AHH OOP!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoqLnkcjZmQ) with the funky and retro styling. They really like to have harmonies (since the group harmonizes so well) and big band/band accompaniment in songs (for example, [Mr. Ambiguous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D15-XYRubsc).  

As individuals, Hwasa really like to sing dramatically and with a sultry tone, so a lot of times you get little cat growls or similar lines in their songs. Moonbyul's raps usually come off as a little boyish and punchy, which is always fun.

I also think that Tiffany deserved a stronger solo career due to the limits that SNSD songs had on her range.

&gt;Anything other than an IOI song

&gt;Here is a suggestion not to sing: Don't sing Wee Woo at any cost

---

Now this is where the fun part begins! So how this is going to work is:

1. You guys sing and record your dry vocals (no music, just your raw voice) singing along to the entire song.
2. Send us your dry vocals to redditkpop101@gmail.com.
3. We'll mix it with the instrumentals.
4. Hang tight while we finalise and upload the song with everyone's voices!

####How to record and send 
([section](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hvurc/project_ranime_sings_colors_by_flow_code_geass_op/?st=j9westlp&amp;sh=fdeb6d0e) stolen from /u/IbrahimT13)  
If you already know how to record your voice, skip this section and just send a **.wav** (preferrably in 48kHz), **.m4a** (preferrably 256kbps or higher), or **.flac** file.  You do not have to use Audacity.

1. Download [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net).

2. Connect your mic, and at the bottom left corner of audacity, [set your Project Rate (Hz) to 48000](https://i.imgur.com/DUvVLa8.png).

3. Press the red circle record button to start recording, and press the yellow square button to stop recording.

4. File &gt; Export as a **.wav** file. 

5. Email the file to **redditkpop101@gmail.com**. Make sure to include your reddit name if you want to be credited.

6. If the file is too big, upload to Google Drive (or Mediafire, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box.com, Mega) and email the link.

7. This should be the **dry vocal (no music, just your raw voice)**

8. If you're up to giving ad libs a shot, upload that as a separate file in your email.

**Other recording tips:**

* If you found a lot of noise in your recording, please leave a 20 seconds gap of silence so the editor can get a good sample of background noise.

* Don't sing too close to your mic - it causes clipping/distortion.

* Higher notes are easier to sing if you sing confidently/loudly and with good breath support.

* Have fun with it!

- Astro's Crazy Sexy Cool

**-PLEASE, please, pleaseeee only pick one name and link their stuff so people can check it out and not get overwhelmed by a list and ignore it.**

**-Also, please don't give names of people that are clearly far from underrated. (Ex.: Anyone from groups like EXO, RV, BB, BP, BTS,etc.)**

For me, its WINNER's Kim Jinwoo.

[Here's a compilation though its old af](https://youtu.be/6HFXCrBm66E)

[Here's a recent solo Radio Star performance](https://youtu.be/gHoEL6VaCcc)

[Here's him trying to be as rebellious/cool as GD in his cover of Crooked but actually ending up being cute as hell](https://youtu.be/uTmcknXJYlI)

Why is I believe he's underrated:

-He's a YG sub vocal. These usually dont get any attention because they're overshadowed heavily by the main vocals in the group.

-He's in a group with Nam Taehyun and Kang Seungyoon - both are believed to have legendary vocal timbres.

-He usually didn't sing the main parts as he was considered a 'weak' vocal aka someone who isnt a falsetto/cant hit high notes but imo he's always had a very distinctive sweet voice. Unlike 99% of people, I was attracted by his voice more than anyone else when I listened to my very first WINNER song because his voice is so sweet, it sounds like an angel singing.

1216,2017-11-14,2017,11,14,6,7cqg6d,Idols with false birth dates?,AZUR3WRATH,1510608547,"So Starship had Star1's celebrating Bora, Hyolyn, and Soyou's birthdays on the false dates. For 7 years, Bora's was January 30, 1990 since it was on her resident registration, but when she signed with Hook Entertainment turns out it's December 30, 1989. Hook said that both dates are correct (which is weird) and she didn't lie.

Under Starship, Hyolyn's birth date was January 11, 1991. Yesterday at her announcement of her own label Brd, Naver put her actual one, December 11, 1990. SISTAR19 both born in December lol.

AND, Soyou's friend exposed her actual birthday (I think she also said it herself by mistake once). Her birthday isn't February 12, 1992, but I believe September 11, 1991. Starship has yet to reveal this. Maybe once she leaves the company it'll be more public lol...

*Is there any other cases of this?* I thought it was really interesting how  the company did this. And I doubt they're the only idols who have this as well. I feel like a company might do this to make an idol appear younger.


edit: Maybe, ""Idols with different birth dates?"" rather than false, because the calendar's and whatnot.",44,62

- When Kyla from Pistin was being bullied online for her weight

- When Jackson from GOT7 had that awful prank pulled on him where he was made to believe he was meeting up with his mother but wasn't. Luckily JYP pulled through and got them to meet up with each other.

1227,2017-11-14,2017,11,14,10,7cs54x,Your opinion on the distribution of music in Kpop?,tmijwjpjcybkky,1510623404,"I was wondering what you all think about how music is accessed/downloaded/streamed from the position of an international fan. At the moment it is very accessible to everyone through platforms such as YouTube where I notice people upload full albums and audio tracks that people just download and listen to for free. (Maybe this is a reason why kpop is so appealing)

But as kpop becomes more and more popular, do you think companies will become stricter on this type of distribution e.g claim copyright? Do you think itll remain the same? Are there any solutions you might consider that will allow the artists to at least benefit from this kind of distribution?

I bring this up because of Wanna Ones recent comeback but Im sure many other groups experience this. Because the group has a strong korean fandom, its very welcoming to see a fair balance between korean and English comments.  And because Koreans have their own streaming platforms, I assume they dont really pay attention to whats occurring on YouTube. But many of them are angry to find people uploading Wanna Ones music to YouTube claiming it is illegal, youre not a real fan, and stealing potential money the group could earn.  And many of the international responses to this is along the lines of I dont have the money, I have other life priorities to spend on, I cant stream on melon etc. Are these good enough reasons from both sides though?

* This is the thirteenth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* **You can suggest only 3 songs.**
* **Each song has to be of a different group.**
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Girl Groups**!

* Any song by a Girl Group. Choose wisely.
* It can be old or new. 

Here are my contributions -

* [Red Velvet - Dumb Dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0)
* [BLACKPINK - BOOMBAYAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwmSjveL3Lc)
* [2NE1 - I Am The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o)

Girl Group playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgduHpDcOnku5TyMK8TBeVF6_)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

^ Here's an interesting article from Billboard. I haven't yet formed a solid opinion on either side of the argument. I can see how these shows provide something agencies would have a very difficult time achieving--national and international exposure and recognition prior to official debut. I can also see how it could be a bad thing for the agencies and the artists--networks eventually taking over the agencies' roles and taking more off the top of artists' paychecks (see recent article about how [Kang Daniel was one of the lowest paid members of Wanna One](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/11/kang-daniel-revealed-to-be-the-wanna-one-member-who-received-the-lowest-first-payment)). 

I'm curious what the rest of you might have to say about the issue.

Text from article:
&gt; First I.O.I dominated as the rookie K-pop group to watch in 2016, and now their successors Wanna One have been doing much of the same. Both temporary acts formed by the Korean reality show Produce 101, the pair is not only a symbol of success and popularity in the fast-paced K-pop world, but also a nod at a directional shift that is shaking up the Korean music industry. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; With three current on-air shows -- The Unit, which seeks to revive the careers of failed K-pop stars; Mix Nine, an audition show produced by YG Entertainment (BIGBANG, Blackpink) featuring K-pop idols from other companies; Stray Kids, a show featuring JYP Entertainment (TWICE, GOT7) focusing on that labels trainees -- coming on the heels of the immensely successful two seasons of Produce 101 to produce their own idol groups, there has never been more interest in Korean star search programs from Korean audiences, who get to play a role in crafting what they hope will be the next big K-pop group, and overseas K-pop fans, who get to cheer on from afar.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; But even though many K-pop-star hopefuls are joining the shows with the aim of getting their name out there and make it big, the influx of TV programs are causing discontent in the industry as television networks move into the playing field to act as content producers just as much as purveyors.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; While Mix Nine and Stray Kids are co-productions with entertainment companies, Mnets Produce 101 and KBS The Unit are causing upset to Koreas music scene with industry trade groups joining together to protest this rise in audition programs, which they say may lead to monopolies. Last Sunday (Nov. 5), Yonhaps Chang Dong-woo reported that a joint statement from the Korea Management Federation, the Korea Music Content Industry Association, and the Korea Entertainment Producers Association expressed concern that television networks continuing to produce shows like this could lead to the withering of the music industry due to monopoly-like control of new talent, leaving little room for music labels and agencies.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Singing competitions are nothing new in South Korea, but what has changed and spurred the response is the way profits are being divided. In the past, shows typically resulted in stars getting a contract with a specific label, shining light on talent but not becoming talent producers. Now, with the likes of Produce 101 and The Unit, television networks are shifting their business model to become co-producers and raking in profit that typically trickled down to artists.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Even in 2017, network television is arguably still the single greatest driving force in South Korean pop culture -- so it's almost surprising that it took this long for the big TV stations to realize they could concoct top K-pop groups themselves, Seoul-based music critic Jakob Dorof told Billboard. Shows like Superstar K and K-Pop Star [two other popular Korean audition programs] have been minting successful careers for years, but those kinds of shows typically discover singer-songwriter types that a TV network wouldn't know how to develop. With aspiring pop idols, it's a lot simpler: their agencies have already invested all the cost and effort of training them.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; The difference, according to Dorof, is that singer-songwriters need to mature following their discovery on the former shows and so are typically signed to a label upon being declared winner, while the idol-based shows feature contestants who have typically already been prepped for their careers by entertainment companies and are ready to debut on the spot.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; The TV network effectively takes control of the most popular idols for a large chunk of their commercial prime. So it makes a lot of sense that some of those talent agencies are beginning to feel like that's maybe not such a great deal, Dorof says.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; According to Yonhap, the last season of Produce 101 saw CJ E&amp;M, which owns and operates Mnet, get 25 percent of profits from the activities surrounding the winning team Wanna One, with YMC Entertainment, the company that manages the bands activities until their contract ends at the end of next year, getting another 25 percent. The remainder is split among the 11 band members of Wanna One and their individual management companies, which, when evenly split, means just a little over 4.5 percent of profits to each man and his label.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; But with over 10 million votes tallied during the finale of this years Produce 101 -- the equivalent to one-fifth of South Koreas population partaking in voting -- its hard to deny that Korean audiences are more than happy to watch these sort of shows, while international K-pop fans are also showing support to them: Wanna Ones response at their first stateside appearance at KCON 2017 LA had event organizers on the brink of shutting down events featuring the band due to security concerns from fervent fans attempting to get close to the boy band. Theyre also impressive regarding album sales: their first EP, 1X1=1 (To Be One), which debuted on the World Album Chart at No. 3, sold over 762,000 copies. It was the first time since the 90s any K-pop boy band achieved that sort of sales with a debut album.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; Another factor here, I think, is bitterness, says Dorof, referring to the music industrys growing dissent. It takes any one agency years of training and tons of financial investment to debut a group and even stand a chance of ever making a profit. Meanwhile, it takes a TV station a couple of months -- during which they're not investing, but in fact making a fortune in advertising -- to assemble a group like Wanna One. No matter how great the exposure is for the individual members, their parent agencies are probably going to have second thoughts about whether that's an industry trend they want to enable.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; These sort of television shows arent just impacting the careers and companies behind the winners; Produce breathed new life into K-pop as a whole by enabling many new faces to build recognition and followings simultaneously. The second season of Produce 101 saw NuEsts career get a second wind, while both seasons of the show saw solo and groups acts emerge featuring popular contestants. The other shows currently airing will likely see similar successes.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; As a quick, financially sound way for television networks to produce new acts and launch the careers of K-pop idols, all the while bringing in millions of viewers and advertising revenue, the audition show trend has reached new heights in 2017 and will likely continue into 2018, with another season of Produce 101 already in the works. What the extended ramifications are on the Korean music industry remain to be seen, but its unlikely that the audition competition show trend will disappear anytime soon.",14,7

**-Only includes kpop groups - excludes soloists, duos, OSTs, bands.**

**-List only comprises of the BIGGEST hits this year. Songs like EXO's Kokobop, Power, WannaOnes Energetic and BTS' DNA are not included since they're behind these songs digitally and/or their numbers are misleading due to fans mass streaming.**

**-List does not feature recent hits like BTOB's Missing You and TWICE's Likey.**

**-I originally started this compilation to determine potential SOTY winner from idol groups. I only recently tried to make a downloads chart for the same. Since Knock Knock was the most downloaded song and Really Really, AIIYL and RF were upcoming as really strong competition - these are the only ones I bothered to list for the downloads category.**

**-Downloads are actually easier to manipulate than streams (feel free to question why in the comments). Streams are a better indicator for a songs popularity.**

**-I ranked these songs acc. to some categories in my last post already - not much has changed in a week but some significant developments have taken place - hence this post will just be a commentary on those developments :3**

** *TAKE THIS ENTIRE THING WITH A BAG OF SALT AND A CRITICAL EYE. IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS/COMMENTS, PLS COMMENT. THANKS.* **

**Observations from Week 45: Streaming Chart***Observations:*

Top 3 Streamed Songs:

1. BIGBANG's FXXK IT - 94M Streams in 33 weeks. (Chart Out)
2. TWICE's Knock Knock - 91.8M Streams in 30 weeks. (Chart Out))
3. WINNER's Really Really - 91.4M Streams in 32 weeks. (Still Charting)

Top 3 Streamed BG Songs:

1. BIGBANG's FXXK IT - 94M Streams in 33 weeks (Chart Out)
2. WINNER's Really Really - 91M Streams in 32 weeks. (Still Charting)
3. BTS' Spring Day - 78M Streams in 39 weeks. (Still Charting)

Top 3 Streamed GG Songs:

1. TWICE's Knock Knock - 91.8M Streams in 30 weeks. (Chart Out)
2. BLACKPINK's AIIYL - 76.5M Streams in 21 weeks. (Still Charting)
3. Red Velvet's Red Flavor - 73M Streams in 18 weeks. (Still Charting)

*Top Performing Songs: Short Run*

1. FXXK IT - BIGBANG
2. SIGNAL - TWICE
3. RED FLAVOR - RED VELVET

*Top Performing Songs: Long Run*

1. REALLY REALLY - WINNER
2. BIGBANG - FXXK IT
3. AIIYL - BLACKPINK (!)

(!) -Replaced BTS's Spring Day. Just like I predicted last week, AIIYL looks like a really strong long run performer, its long term numbers are catching up with Really Really's. Now all 3 songs in this category are from YG.

*Misc. Observations:* (tl;dr: AIIYL - v.good, spring day: good, rr: good, red flavor: not disappointed but surprised)

**-Blackpinks AIIYL takes lead over Really Really for most streamed song per week twice in a row.**

-**AIIYL replaces Spring Day from last week for the top 3 performing song in the long run category** - well see if this will be temporary or permanent but given the peak that AIIYLs been showing for the past few weeks, it wouldnt be right to NOT have it be in the top 3 anymore...

**-AIIYL is the only song to have shown an impressive long run streak for an idol group release post WINNERs RR.** This also now means that the top 3 performing releases in the long run from idol groups for 2017 are all from YG.

**-Though Red Flavor received a lot of hype and love during its initial few weeks - it is unfortunately showing lacklustre results in the long run.** Maybe its because Summer has worn off. However, RFs numbers will likely boost up again with their November comeback.

**-Spring Day is still the longest charting song on the list and still going really strong** (though like I said last time, imma say this again - I think this sudden boost for Spring Days numbers is the fans doing - yes, a song can do good in the long run, yes a song can do better on the charts after its initial weeks but only in the near short run will it be possible that the song is outdoing its initial weeks' sales, it is unlikely that a song will outsell its initial sales by such huge margins about 30 weeks in.) I do believe that it is one of this year's best performing idol group releases - hence, its even on this list but the sudden uprise is def. not reliable to me.

**-Really Really is still charting and is coming close to surpassing Knock Knocks streams**itll be quite legendary if a boy group release manages to beat a girl groups streams by end of the year. Really Really also climbed up significantly on the charts rank-wise despite the number of new releases in the past week - this could be a result of WINNERs Youth Over Flowers broadcast pulling in public attention for the group again - also evident in the fact that the song now peaks as high as #44 on Melon everyday in the past week despite it being over 7 months since its release.

**-Contrary to my expectations - no boost in sales for Signal or Knock Knock post TWICEs comeback.** Which could also mean that its not fans that are mass streaming TWICE. Also, the fact that people now have a full album from them to listen to so it makes sense that they wont be going back to their past releases.

**Observations from Week 45: Downloads Chart**

Top 4 (in order of sales):

1. WINNER's Really Really - 1.446m dls in 32 weeks. Still charting.
2. TWICE's Knock Knock - 1.441m dls in 30 weeks. Chart Out.
3. BLACKPINK's AIIYL - 1.231m dls in 21 weeks. Still Charting.
4. Red Velvet's Red Flavor - 1.207m dls in 18 weeks. Still Charting.

Top 4 (in short run):

1. Red Velvet's Red Flavor - Reached 1m dls in 12 weeks.
2. Twice's Knock Knock - Reached 1m dls in 13 weeks.
3. Blackpink's AIIYL - Reached 1m dls in 14 weeks.
4. WINNER's Really Really - Reached 1m dls in 17 weeks.

Top 4 (in long run): TBD

*Misc. Observations:*

**-Just as was predicted, Really Really surpasses Knock Knock to become the most downloaded idol group release of 2017.**

-**RF reached 1.2m dls this week becoming the fastest idol group release to reach that mark this year - however, RF has been in the bottom for 4-5 weeks lately consistently despite being at the top in the beginning with a large margin.** Again, probably because its not summer anymore and they might improve with next comeback.

1519,2017-11-17,2017,11,17,12,7di4fn,Red Velvet - Peek-A-Boo @ KBS Music Bank (171117),ravingphanatic,1510890718,"I didnt attend any music shows for Red Flavor, but with my time ending in Korea very soon I decided to go see Red Velvet whenever I can. Without further ado, a brief summary of the song and my experience!

Highlights of the song/stage/outfits:

- Very simple stage, no noticeable props set up. Background is a space/cosmic theme with clouds at the bottom and a very big Red Velvet  logo in the middle.

- Members came out from the right side. I was on the far left so couldnt really see them that well. At one point when talking to the staff, Yeri cackled very loudly. We all had a good laugh.

- Members came up one by one. Most of the outfits were from the teasers. Irene was wearing a very sparkly dress with the velvet boots. Seulgi was wearing a teal one piece suit and long golden gloves. Wendy was wearing that one outfit with the Nike thing (dont know how to describe it). Joy was absolutely stunning in a black dress with her hair tied up with a bow. Yeri was wearing something I recall Irene wore in a teaser (?).

- Starting formation: Wendy, Seulgi, and Irene are standing in one line. Wendy in the back, Irene in the front, Seulgi in the middle. Next to Seulgi are Yeri and Joy. She stretches out her arms to measure the distance from Yeri and Joy to get that perfect formation.

- Song starts. Familiar snippets from the recent music video teaser start off. Once the vocals kick in, very strong drum beats start. Seulgi has the opening part, then Wendy. Yeri and Joy get the pre chorus, which is absolutely stunning. 
- Choreography is gorgeous. Definitely a lot of complex moments - Kyle Hanagami did this very well, props to him. The use of cascading is very clean and elegant. 

- Yeri rap after first chorus. Enough said. Also, excuse me.

- Irene and Joy get the next pre chorus. The buildup with the peek-a-boo pose is eerily calming. 

- Wendys part with the bridge is really nice. The choreography at this point is really cool. Ill describe it the best I can here: members look in various directions in synchronization will standing still. Wendy just serenades us with her voice. 

- Irene ends the song with some soothing ooohs.  

- The song is amazing. Definitely captures the Velvet side in a more upbeat manner. Id say its the Velvet cousin to Red Summer. Not as energetic, but the upbeat tempo is there. 

- They performed three times. They looked fairly tired, but they waved and smiled to us a lot. At one point Seulgi asked us if we liked the song and we all screamed we liked it!

Also found out I got into the fan sign for tomorrow. I dont even know what to say them. ah geez.

I enjoyed DDD, but I think most of their title tracks after Up &amp; Down are too one-dimensional. I keep waiting for the day that they come back with a song or a concept like Every Night.

[Hyolyn](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sSSevIAOnS8/maxresdefault.jpg) is one of the idols that comes to my mind right away due to her beautiful skin tone and how it differs quite a bit even from the other SISTAR girls in terms of the golden tan rather than porcelain. Her career wasn't effected much or at all that I know of due to her darker complexion, especially since most SISTAR songs were summer bops.       
[Michelle Lee](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QrDUGfVaxAU/maxresdefault.jpg) has one of the most emotional songs I've ever heard to date. I still cry when I listen to her song [Without You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLl-Xwoos68). ~~Being Korean-AfricanAmerican growing up in Korea it's insane to see how people instantly assume she's a foreigner, and by extension an outsider of sorts. (I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju2d4Vgxl8M) video is the video that judges assume shes foreign, but I can't remember due to a lack of subs..)~~ Thank you to /u/eriye900 for correcting my memory of this clip, [this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7dq267/exidolsextrainees_who_dont_fit_the_korean_beauty/dpzoji0/) breaks it down accurately, however the main point still applies of her race has made it harder to succeed in her career. :)          
[Oh My Girl's JinE](https://koreaboo.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/jine.jpg) ended up leaving the group, and as of now the entertainment industry, recently due to an intense battle with anorexia. It's not uncommon to hear idols talk about the ""diets"" that are essentially encouraging anorexic tendencies so it's nice to see an idol and agency put the health of an individual first before the scale.          
What are some other idols y'all can think of that have been effected by the beauty standards or in some way effected the beauty standards? Doesn't have to be negatively effected, such as how Hyolyn has shown a lot of mainstream idols that non-porcelain isn't bad.",156,98

Not to take away from what they can do but....Well because I know how to play, I can tell easily that their level is amateurish. Not in a sense that by definition they aren't professional, but ""good enough to fool people who don't know anything about guitar, but for even most beginning guitarist know these guys only know the basics?"" type of deal. Playing couple chords on guitar doesn't seem to fit my criteria even for a amateur hobbyist.  Not very ""high leveled""

anyway onto the point, I do not know anything about photography, and I see all these image teasers, photo concept, album covers.

This is seen as pretty normal and expected as groups age and mature. My question is, are there any examples of groups you feel have changed significantly since the loss or addition of a member? Has the group been forced to change their sound to accommodate or somehow retained their style despite the new voice? Do you personally think the member change was a good decision considering the group's previous discography? This is not a thread for hating on old/new members. There's no problem with feeling like the new member takes away from the group's sound and commenting on that, but don't unnecessarily bash anyone. Feel free to talk about changes in performances, line distributions, group dynamics, etc.

For me, this was inspired for Red Velvet's recent comeback. I've always felt that OT4 Red Velvet is an entirely different jungle from OT5 Red Velvet. OT4 Red Velvet felt a little bit more mature and sophisticated. When Yeri was added, the group was able to venture into more fun and quirky territory because of Yeri's young age and the limitations that come with that. However, as of the new comeback, I almost recognize Red Velvet's old sound again (likely because of Yeri's recent legalization). The addition of Yeri added a new rapper and an interesting dynamic between the remaining members, who are all at least three years older than her.

Hey  cha-cha-cha-check it, let it go!

Like I mentioned, this weeks Jukebox is a special edition  it revolves around a theme and as such I picked the songs for this one. I dont normally pick all the songs, but in the case of the themed ones, I do. And the theme is none other than the #10 itself! Yep, this week is all about songs that incorporate 10, as well as interpreting Ten in different ways! Next week well go back to the normally scheduled randomly picked songs shenanigans, but for now, here are the songs I picked out for this week!

1. [Girls Generation - All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4w8IbQTJpY) ([Documentary version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzEJPRqLUZE))
2. [UP10TION - White Night ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yco8SOHz8M)
3. [Red Velvet - Perfect 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cdOFuPPdDU)
4. [MV] [Ten - Dream in a Dream ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4gCv1CifJg)
5. [AOA - 10 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKSwzfNECBc)
6. [TWICE - 1 to 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYWD9IlZ4N8) 
7. [10cm x Chen - Bye Babe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t3qKc1xwCE)

**[I LIKE TO PARTY!](https://gfycat.com/MadeupYellowishFurseal)** 

Just a recap of the rules: Leave your review for a song as a reply to the comment with the song and title. Provide some sort of substantive insight into the song, but you can still be creative and fun in your reviews. Also, you don't have to review each song, feel free to review as many as you want! Just as a reminder (again): *Downvoting someone's comment/rate doesn't change the overall score a song gets at the end of the day.* I am literally just going to be taking the average of the scores for the overall song score. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you are encouraged to review both the MV and the music itself. Totally optional to review the MV though! You can leave reviews throughout the entire week: I start calculating usually on Fridays/Saturdays but _you're allowed to submit your reviews and scores up to 11:59 pm PST the Friday before the next Jukebox._

Chase Me is the fifth-highest ranked song! Im happy it is and I hope that translates to more success for them in the future. Oh My Girl has fallen progressively with each week, but Closer is still going strong in our Top 10, and while it might not stay up there forever, Im still happy its up there. SHINee is still the most represented artist on our Top 10, although they now have two songs up there instead of three  Feel Good unfortunately dropped out.

1672,2017-11-19,2017,11,19,5,7dvok5,Red Velvet 2nd Album Perfect Velvet Fansign (plus some Inkigayo at SBS) @ KBS Media Center (17118),ravingphanatic,1511038516,"With my time in Korea nearing its end, I made it a personal goal to see Red Velvet as much as I could before I leave (as of now, I just saw them 4 days consecutively). I just got back from the Inkigayo prerecording so Ill mention some highlights from that as well. Prior to this, I only met Red Velvet once at a Red Summer fan sign, so I was really excited to see and talk to them again. I didnt really prepare anything to say or any gifts, so it was really freestyle and letting things flow naturally.

As a precaution, Im writing this on no sleep within the past 20 hours (it was literally fansign then straight to Inkigayo), so I apologize for any grammatical errors and vague details. 


Without further ado, here are my interactions with each member in order!

- Yeri: I had such a fun time with her the first time I met her, I was just ecstatic to talk to her again. The moment I approached her, we said our greetings. She asked where I was from, looked down at the post it note with my name, and stared down for a moment. She went wait, this name sounds familiar She looked up to me, eyes widened, and showed enthusiasm that I came back for another fan sign! Her enthusiasm throughout our conversation was really great and it made me happy. We had a lot of smiles and laughs, but at the end I struggled a bit I went for a high five while she went for a handshake. I was too braindead to realize what was going on and we had a god damn awkward hand moment with me trying to readjust my hand for the handshake. Yeah. That fucking happened. Nonetheless, we said goodbye. She wrote a little Ill miss u so much note in my album. 
- Joy: This time with Joy it was a little awkward. I could tell she wasnt really having the best day with her expressions in between signing for people. Last time, she was very enthusiastic and charming, but there was just something on her mind that day. She did seem to recognize me and did make a little note that said it was good to see you again, but she made little effort to speak in English. I sort of blanked out on any Korean I knew (which is hardly anything) and I felt awful not being able to return proper responses to her questions. She smiled at me at the end and we shook hands.
- Seulgi: Last time, all I could do was compliment Seulgi. This time, however, she took the initiative and spoke English to me! The moment she asked where are you from, I was taken aback. She poked her head forward awaiting my response. I told her where I came from and told her about how I attended Red Room and that I would be seeing them later at Inkigayo. She smiled and gave me an enthusiastic wow. She was so cute, just absolutely wonderful. 
- Irene: First thing Irene does is ask where Im from. It was a little struggle communicating with her this time due to my nonexistent Korean and again, I felt bad not knowing enough to converse with her. I did my best to communicate whatever was on my mind and the best thing I came up with was when noona smiles, Im happy. She enthusiastically responded ah, !!! It was followed by the trademark Irene eyesmile and laugh. Way better than last time when I just stared at her.
- Wendy: When I was in line waiting for my turn with Irene, there was a moment where Wendy and I looked at each other and she gave me a really hearty smile. When I handed her my album, she asked where I came from and when I arrived in Korea. I pretty much gave her the same response as last time and I saw the gears turning in her head. She whispered, wait a minute Oh my god she remembered me. I told her about how I pretty much came to Korea to see her and the Red Velvet members as much as I could (which was true) and told her how much I was touched by her solo stage at their concert. Her eyes widened at my response, then giggled when she told me she was nervous when she was did her solo (at this point she wrote a THANX &lt;3 in my album). I then told her I would be seeing them again later at Inkigayo and she proceeded to tell me to get some sleep and warned me it would be cold. After we had a solid conversation, my mind blanked and she just sat there silently waiting for me to say something else. Im pretty sure I just stood there wearing a huge shit-eating grin and went Yup. God damn it cant get anymore awkward than that. Still, I had a memorable time with her, said goodbye, and shook hands. Her hands were really warm.

After all the members finished signing, they had a long talk segment. The entire fan sign lasted two and a half hours! Ill highlight some moments that I recall, including funny moments that happened during the fan sign:

- After Yeri was done signing, she pulled her chair out to the side. Yeri had pigtails and had matching colored socks with her sweater (all the members wore comfortable clothing - they didn't have any busy schedules prior). She stuck out her leg for us to see and showed us the matching colors, freaking adorable. 
- After Joy finished singing, she asked what Yeri was doing so far away from the tables and proceeded to scoot over closer to her.
- During the fan sign, a fan site gave Wendy a Nintendo Switch. 
- A fan gave Wendy a tube of toys of some sort. She shook the tube and struggled to get them out and made really cute frustrated faces. 
- When all the members were finished, Yeri talked A LOT. She then commented about how the fan chants just got released and that we should practice it. We proceeded to get an a cappella performance of Peekaboo and practiced the fan chant.
- They werent set to perform Look and danced the entire song for us. What. a. treat. 
- Members were taking keywords from the audience for topics of discussion. This including MV shooting, favorite songs from the album, album jacket, etc. Joy mentioned I Just was supposed to be a station song, but they liked it so much and kept it for the album.
- At one point Joy kept talking about the word merong which is slang for sticking out your tongue. Every time she said it, she would crack herself up. Before they left she said it one more time and laughed all by herself on the way out. 
- Yeri, Joy, and Irene played a game that involved trying to see who could raise their voice the most. 
- Members talked about the Japanese showcase, Yeri responded with sugoii desu ne. Some members talked a bit about their Japanese proficiency. 
- At the end before they said their final goodbyes, Seulgi dropped the mic and disappeared behind the table for a bit. 

Fast forward a few hours (roughly 1 AM, didnt get in until after 3:30 AM), Im in line outside waiting for Inkigayo. Ill just say the stage is gorgeously decorated. Spooky cats, fake plants and stuff, and a huge Peek-A-Boo sign. It seemed like Joy was definitely not having a good day considering her expressions and responses to the audience. Everybody else, especially Yeri, seemed very cheery and responsive to the fans. They performed a total of four times. 


Well, thats pretty much it. I had a good time with the fan sign. I hope to attend at least one more before I leave Korea. It was fun!

1681,2017-11-19,2017,11,19,10,7dxhox,171117 Super Junior SMTOWN Theatre Fan Sign Event,jolaurence,1511056344,"Disclaimer: I am typing this on my phone because I am too lazy to get out my laptop cause its cold in my apartment. Also, this is gonna be a mess. 

Ive been into kpop for 5 years now and yes, I do like to listen to Super Junior but I dont consider myself an ELF. But after interacting with a few ELF on Friday, I have to say that there have been a lot of misconceptions.

When this fan sign was announced a coworker and I went to the Coex Artium to buy albums on Tuesday. The event was for 300 people. 100 people get to have their albums signed and 200 get to watch them. Both of us bought super low. The notice for those who got in went up Thursday. I got in but my friend didnt. After an hour, the results disappeared and then came back. SM didnt post the list correctly and apologized. The list wasnt distributed equally for those who got into the sign and to watch. 

Check in started at 6:30 pm Friday up in the 5th floor. I got there shortly after and got in line to check in. The lady who checked me in was someone I noticed from NCT promotions before. Luckily she didnt notice me. I was given a stamp on my wrist, a box of chocolate and picked my ticket. They gave us chocolate for an apology about the notice being wrong the first time. And it wasnt any chocolate. It was the SUM Market Super Junior chocolate and that SUM Market chocolate is good in general.

Anyway, went and got food and then came back. I sat down in my seat and got ready for the viewing. The girl next to me was from Japan I believe and asked if I had come alone. She was super nice. She asked me which members I liked and I said Heechul cause hes my savage king and Donghae because...that face. All of my interactions with ELF were great. They were all so nice. It put into perspective for me that we always talk about the fans of groups that do bad things and dont talk enough about the kind fans who are nice. Every fandom has fans that are pretty bad but every fandom has kind fans and they deserve more attention.

Anyway, back on topic. Those old men who still look fine as can be came in and Leeteuk right away went into MC mode. He cant not MC I swear. He was telling us how the fan sign was going to go. First, those in the center will get up row by row and go up the stairs to him and then go down the line to Donghae and then walk back down to their seats. I was in direct line of sight of Donghae and he looked at me a few times. That man is fine. Also he was wearing velvet and I was not okay. He and Shindong were at the last table together and talking when Donghae hit Shindongs hand because there was finally someone for him to talk to. But before it began, Super Junior greeted ELF and ELF greeted Super Junior and my heart grew a few sizes. 

Randomly the members would pick up their microphones and would talk into them. Heechul...oh Heechul. Hes so extra. He would randomly shout English and then take the mic and talk more while dealing with fans. Then, one fan made him become the most extra thing in the world. She had brought up this toy gun that shoots out money. She gave it to Heechul and instantly the dork stood up and started to play with it, having money flying everywhere and laughing, while making a mess. They had to clean up the money. God this extra man.  Towards the end of the fan sign a girl gave Donghae a flower crown and he kept it on!!! All of us on my side were screaming.

After each member finished, they started talking into the mics. Then when Shindong ended, they started to have their closing ments. A lot of it has been translated already on the internet but they alluded to everything that has been going on and thanked the fans. They also talked about MAMA and Super Show. They did the greeting one more time with ELF saying bye to them and left. 

Those who were in the center got to leave first. The rest of us left row by row because surprise! Super Junior had signed mini posters for us. You got to pick your poster randomly. I picked mine and got Shindong. Then, I went downstairs and outside and got down there in time to see them leave.

Overall, it was fun. Theyre pretty enjoyable guys. Their fans are cool. And I hope I can get a Super Show ticket closer to the date of the show if they are still available because Super Shows are legendary. ",16,63

So positives first: the venue was pretty small (it's a Korean noraebang) so it was a very intimate setting and perfect to see Grace up close. It was pretty much all standing, with a small stage for her to perform. Grace has such a strong stage presence and she really brought her A-game.

Now... the negatives.

So first off, a little back story. My friend won free VIP tickets and offered me her extra. The ticket was supposed to come with both a photo-op and a mini fansign (it was supposed to be posters, but my friend said the people running the event were pretty cool if VIP holders wanted to bring other stuff to get signed since there was a small number of us). The ticket was priced around $75USD. So a pretty good deal, right? Yeah, not so much.

Turns out that Grace's sole merch (hats) and the posters that she were supposed to sign for VIP holders were somehow stolen at the airport. What's worse is that the promoters didn't tell ANY of the VIP ticket holders of this, and even more terrible is that they LIED to us and said that the poster signing was going to be after Grace's set when some people asked about it before the show started. It was only after things were wrapping up about 15 minutes later after Grace performed that they told me that the signing was cancelled...and that was only because I asked since I had a printed cover of Zombie High I wanted her to sign.

While the photo-op when smoothly, it seems that the promoter offered selfie shots with Grace as an ""exchange"" for not doing the fansign...but they didn't explicitly state this and it's just my assumption. I did get a photo with her holding the ZH cover (I had brought it with me since I initially assumed the photo-op/fansign was going to be done all before the show since there was maybe about 20 of us), and she was really nice and made me laugh since she didn't recognize the cover at first. She totally blanked and thought I had drawn it and it was random fan art.

Also, the way the entire event was scheduled so weird. They did like ""k-pop club"" night from 7PM-11PM, then Gemini performed, then Grace did.

Gemini performed about 6-7 songs, making his set about 25-30 minutes. Grace came on right after him and had a surprisingly VERY short set. She performed 6 songs which were:

* I'm Fine
* Trick or Treat
* [Slay](https://www.youtube.com/watch&amp;v=XUng0gLvbv4)
* Zombie High
* BTS' Blood Sweat and Tears
* A ""hip-hop"" cover of I'm Fine

So yeah, she performed for maybe 20-25 minutes.

So in the end, people payed up to $75USD to hear 1 hour of actual performances and to otherwise dance to 3 hours of k-pop music, which is a huge ripoff IMO. Also, I'm pressed that Grace AND the promoters didn't have the decency to apologize for cancelling the fansign AND that the promoters didn't even bother to offer those that paid for these privileges some compensation or viable alternative for not getting what they paid for.

I'm still glad I got to go, and Grace seemed nice and was a dynamic performer. But this whole thing was a mess. So if you see Hallyu Entertainment bringing your faves over to the USA, be wary.",5,22

I typically linger here for the occasional discussion threads or to see what new MVs are out. I'm completely out of the loop on the fandom stuff, but I have general surface knowledge of the trends. So I wanted to pop in and ask about people's thoughts on how BTS debuted faster into America before Exo? Much respect to both bands, and was curious because I haven't been paying a lot of attention to the backstories or news since they debuted years ago. I only knew that when Exo debuted in Asia, it looked huge and historic, but didn't recall BTS debuting with as much fanfare. Looking forward to some insightful replies!",32,0

As an international fan, this is super inspiring! Sometimes I feel there's not much I can do to support my favorite groups since I can't attend any of their events and don't know enough Korean to translate their content.


So aside from supporting the music by buying albums and streaming, how do you help promote your favorite groups?

Edit: To clarify, rather than promote, maybe I should've said support. I mean anything you do for your faves outside just buying their stuff.",34,11

* This is the fourteenth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* **You can suggest only 3 songs.**
* **Each song has to be of a different group.**
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Boy Groups**!

* Any song by a boy group. Choose wisely.
* It can be old or new. 

Here are my contributions -

* [Big Bang - Bang Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw)
* [Monsta X - Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ9lJ5ctd0s)
* [BTS - DOPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM)

Boy Group playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdsLmy3wI9zSyOHLZa1sm5m7)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

It's so beautiful and intricately designed and unlike any album I'd ever purchased before. You could tell so much time and thought went into developing the packaging alone.

 VIXX's Fantasia Elysium Concert boxset is also beautifully designed.

I have a weak spot for gorgeous albums and I wanted to see what other unique, incredible designs are out there. Anything come to mind?

EDIT: I wanted to extend this a bit to include things like Season's Greetings/Other Special package merch. Some of them have breathtaking designs.",68,124

&amp;nbsp;

#**THE BASICS**
**Name**: Pentagon. To summarize a long winded explanation from Pentagon Maker (that will be below), the group name is based on members being able to complete a 'pentagraph' based on five aspects of music: Performance, Dance, Teamwork, Talent and Mind.

**Fandom Name**: Universe. The fandom name was one of three choices that fans could vote for. The name means that the fans are their universe, following the line *""You are my universe""* from their song *Pentagon* on their debut album. 

**Debut**: October 10, 2016 under Cube Entertainment

**Members**: 10 members, selected through the Mnet survival show *Pentagon Maker* (~~but seriously what was the point of this show again~~)

**Known for**: [incredibly tall maknae](https://imgur.com/a/eK9y8) and having a ridiculous number of comebacks since they debuted in October 2016 (**four Korean comebacks** one Japanese comeback, and two upcoming comebacks (Korean/Japanese)

&amp;nbsp;

*****

#**PENTAGON MAKER SHOW**
Pentagon Maker was a Mnet survival show aimed to create the members of Pentagon. In order to secure their spot to debut in Pentagon, the ten trainees had to complete a ['pentagraph'](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ChgzRjnU4AA7uiw.jpg) based on the following areas: Performance, Dance, Teamwork, Talent and Mind. If they were unable to complete their pentagraph by the end of the show, they would not be able to debut.

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to ~~put yourself through the pain of watching the show~~ watch the show, links for all the episode can be found [here](http://pentagonsub.tumblr.com/pentagonmaker). If you want a tldr; one member was eliminated during the show, but in the end all ten members were able to debut.

Hello, thank you for reading through this mess of a post! I had wanted to write a spotlight for Pentagon for ages, but never got around to it. With the comeback just hours away, I decided this would be the perfect time to finally write this up and hopefully get some more people interested in Pentagon. 

I hope this was informational and entertaining! I know its pretty long haha. ",33,127

Those were the groups that introduced me and got me as a loving kpop fan for a few years before I slowly fizzled out for a bit.

The music was pretty catchy, **but there were 13 of them**. How was I ever going to memorize their faces and learn all of their names? SoShi's got triplets fer crying out loud.  I was kind of overwhelmed, and I didn't know if K-pop was worth the time investment. It took me a while to become a dedicated fan.

This would still fit in line with our album discussions of the past, but also hopefully introduce you all to some new music that statistically you probably have not listened to! 

This week, we thought we'd go back to 2013 with C-Clown's *Shaking Heart* which sold only ~5,300 copies.

On top of that, we have a new wave of idol survival shows where the winners get to be a group that promote within a time frame. It's true that the market is so saturated since the introduction of social media etc. And this make me sad thinking that there are so many talented individuals are being used and being treated like they're disposable if their fame don't explode shortly after debut.

[Giving thanks for the music that (almost) redeemed 2017](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-thanksgiving-music-20171123-story.html)

This is the part I'm talking about:

&gt;Billboard says that in 2018 it plans to change the way it compiles the Hot 100, giving more weight to paid streams (on Apple Music, for instance) than to the free, ad-supported streams (on services such as YouTube) favored by many young people.

If it is, it's just going to be another thing separating the ""have and the have-nots"".   If it's something they're actually considering, I sincerely hope they change their minds.  It's like they're saying next year (2018), when you vote for the ~~AMAs~~ Billboards, votes by people who can afford to (or are willing to) pay for it will count more than those that don't.

Have any of these things happened to people you know personally? Have you yourself begun to think the girl down the street has a big head or the waiter you see at your favorite restaurant should get his eye corners cut?


My sister looks like a mix of both Blackpink Jennie and Rose while I look like the fat Walmart version of Twice Dahyun so I was wrecked in the self-esteem department from the beginning, but K-pop idols were a whole nother level of ""people can be really pretty."" I don't necessarily judge other people but I catch myself thinking like a plastic surgeon sometimes, like ""I would suggest a filler in his forehead"" or ""I should reduce the width of my nose by 5 mm."" I do have higher standards on who I would call beautiful now, but I still don't look for visual godliness in a partner. I'm interested in seeing how K-Pop has affected you guys.",109,75

First of all, as someone who knows YG and has been a YG stan: that's absolute bs lol.

As for actual debut plans, here's what I see happening:

 SM: Will debut a gg next. Which year, I cant tell but I think in 2018 they might start teasing their new gg.

 JYP: Debuting a bg right now and will debut a gg by 2020. Stray Kids are out there and he's already got 2 of the new gg members out to gain publicity- Somi and the JYP trainee on Mix 9. Following the JYP trend, Got7 debut in 2014 and TWICE in 2015. The same will likely follow for JYP's new generation. If thats the case, then we'll get Stray Kids in 2018 and the gg will probably happen in 2019.

 YG: Lol. Lol. Lol. If I were to predict properly - both his bg and gg will debut in the year after JYP debuts his bg and gg. Got7 and WINNER. Stray Kids and the new YG bg with Yedam. BP debut a year after Twice so he possibly could debut a new gg a year after JYP debuts his - which will still be 2020.

Tl;dr, In conclusion, the order is: SM &gt; JYP &gt; YG.

BG: EXO (2011-2012) &gt; GOT7 (2013-2014) &gt; WINNER (2013-2014), iKon (2015)

GG: RV (2014) &gt; TWICE (2015) &gt; BLACKPINK (2016)

New Gen.:

BG: NCT (2016) &gt; Stray Kids (2017-2018) &gt; YG's next bg with Bang Yedam (2018-2019)

GG: SM's ngg (2018-2019) &gt; JYP ngg (2019-2020) &gt; YG ngg (2020 or later)

The same will follow for the Big 3's next generation. SM already has their next bg out in NCT, JYP's Stray Kids will more or less debut by next year and YG's started to publicise his bg members - following the same trend from the big 3's last generation lol.",7,0

As such, I decided to go through and compile the same data for a bunch of other girl groups as well.  I decided to only do 2nd Gen + groups since 1st Gen albums sales were a product of a different era before digital sales.  I took the sales numbers from both full albums and mini albums but not compilation albums.  I also only counted Korean language albums as not all groups have ventured into Japan and I wanted to keep things as even between the groups as possible. Anyways, here is the data:

__________________________________________________________________________

I really found the data interesting and it really made me evaluate what good sales numbers for a girl group are, as I think my perception of good numbers has been skewed of late due to large sales numbers by groups like Twice and Red Velvet.

If there are any major groups I missed, let me know and I can add them.

Now for a bit of a rant: This concert was poorly executed. Why? Red Velvet only performed 5 songs and they were billed as the main performer alongside SHINee. The dance cover groups took up alot of time for a concert where tickets were 350SGD/ticket. (In fairness its from buying 700SGD of beauty products to get tickets.) The MC made multiple dirty jokes which was rather inappropriate for a concert (and was blatant in them, not just some innuendo). Concert lasted 2 hours and a good amount was just chat with the MC and asking questions related to beauty products. Could've been better IMO.


Edit: Just got back home, so here's more detailed account. Went there around 4.30pm (for an anime convention at the same location), was already fairly crowded. Mostly shawols there as they were giving out banners, fan goods such as lightsticks were sold out for SHINee but not for Red Velvet. Queue got pretty bad around 7pm, as people started entering the hall with fairly messy organization. Personally a ReVeLuv but consider myself a light Shawol, so was quite excited! They were showing 1 minute clips of SHINee members (including Onew TT) talking about various topics such as their ideal holiday spots, etc. At 8pm, the concert started with the MC (think he's a local host?) on stage to introduce Shilla Duty Free and Samsung as the sponsors, before inviting Eddy Kim on stage. Before he performed, I didn't really know him but his vocals were beautiful and to top it off he played the guitar really well. 

Following that, was what I was really waiting for... but not really what I wanted. A cover dance group performed Red Dress (which got me hyped until I realised it was the CD version which meant no one was singing [along with the closeups showing unfamiliar faces and not Red Velvet]) and soft fanchants began (like I said, mostly Shawols, along with the fact the entire place was SHINee's colour with one or two pink lights in the distance). Red Velvet finally went on stage and the crowd went nuts! Fanchants began on Dumb Dumb with some shouting all the Dumbs, Russian Roulette had a bigger reaction but when we finally got to Red Flavour (sorry but Rookie didn't seem to be well known by most of the attendees) we had loud fanchants for Red Flavour. Peek a Boo was honestly the highlight of the night, with me unconsciously shouting the full fanchant during the chorus (along with a few others, proud of my Singapore ReVeLuvs!). Unfortunately, they left after 5 songs (I wanted more coz you know, $350 per ticket). SHINee cover group came on stage and crowd went nuts! Fangirls everywhere shouting and singing along with the songs they covered in their dances. Following that, SHINee came on stage and began their set. Kinda disappointed they didn't start with Lucifer/Everybody/Sherlock, but hey, View is pretty damn good. The loudest I ever heard the crowd was during the chorus of View, was seriously loud that even if I put on earplugs I could probably hear them through it. SHINee continued their set with 3 ballad songs (not really ballad but more melodic and 0 dancing). While I love Key's voice (seriously he was the only one performing at his 110% tonight), the other members missed some singing portions, like Jonghyun and Minho missing out sections of the song before continuing with their singing. Felt like they were a little off tonight. Finally, the encore with 1 of 1 left me wanting more (SHINee World in Singapore please!!! Or Red Room!!!) dance tracks, because it felt like a really low energy concert overall.

To make it more interesting, let's make it something not so obvious like please no BoA/TVXQ took kpop to Japan or SM created idol groups. Those are commendable contributions/firsts, but I'm pretty sure we all know about them.

I'll start. I'm not sure if it's known or exactly real lol, but my ultimate bias group After School (and by extension Orange Caramel) were one of the first groups to have a really successful sub-unit. After OC became really popular, it became much more common for other groups to debut a sub-unit. Sistar19, T-ara N4, 2yoon, TaTiSeo, you name em (even boy group sub-units). Suddenly every group was trying a hand at sub-units after Orange Caramel's surprising success that was solidified by 2011.

Only exceptions were SM boy groups having a Chinese sub-group even back in Super Junior and I guess duos happened occasionally.

If I were to mention a couple more kpop firsts by After School:

a) Uee was one of the first idol-turned-actor to be taken seriously.

b) Jooyeon was one of the first big ulzzang idols. I believe her and CNBlue's one were on a whole other level of fame. Most that big went into acting

2270,2017-11-26,2017,11,26,1,7fg4s1,MAMA 2017 in Vietnam Fanaccount,Wstrtbnker1410,1511626632,"So I was lucky enough to be able to attend MAMA in Vietnam. If you think getting a BTS ticket is hard, try again. These tickets resale for like 7-10 times the face value. The site crashed 10 minutes before ticket sale and I got shit. I was not planning on going but I got my flights sponsored (shoutout to China Airlines for amazing service), so I went. I got some of the worst ticket - second floor ticket, for $150 (which is only 2 times the face value).


**Pre-event:** Wanna One arrived first. And they looked hot. I did not mean hot in ""attractive"", I meant hot in ""stuffy"". They wore turtlenecks and coats when the weather here was 82 F. I looked at Daniel and was like boi are you sure you will not suffer a heat shock? Cause I did. I guess it was clothes sponsored by the brand so they have to keep it on for the press. In terms of fans at the airport, I gotta say they did better than the time I was at KCON LA. No doors or windows were broken in the process. But still, crazy fansite bitches with their ladders were there. And it's the biggest ladder you could imagine. As for SVT and Samuel, I was not there. 


**Red carpet:** I did not get a red carpet chance, so I went on a taxi around the venue instead and it was pretty good. I was able to see Samuel and another MC. Samuel looked absolutely stunning. He really is an EYE CANDY. I gotta give credit to the creative fans cause they were able to poke through the skinny paper walls set up by the organization to look into red carpet.


**Main Event:** So I'm not gonna spoil the event by saying who won what. We got a MAMA lightstick, which imo was pretty lit. It will change colors according to song/mood of the stage. Hence, all the stages were well-coordinated between fans and singers. They really tried to make it an ""Asian"" award, so they actually have 3 Viet singers, one from each South East Asian countries that got a nominee. But other than that, they pretty much gave prizes to whoever that attended. 


- **Samuel** was the first Korean artist to perform. He was really cute and his dance moves were smooth. He performed Eye Candy and Sixteen, with a dance break in between. Everyone know the lyrics so well and sang along. I loved how he was sitting near SVT too, I hope that they did interact (but I could not see because second floor seating) :(


- **Wanna One:** I am a pretty big W1. I felt pretty lucky cause I saw them back in KCON LA and now in MAMA. They dressed in black suit. They all looked sleek and handsome. Daehwi and Daniel really looked stunning in their new hair colors. They looked a bit tired, but it made sense. Earlier in the day, Jaehwan was caught trying to cross the street trying to get bubble tea but eventually he did not (haha). Performance wise, they only did Energetic and Burn it Up. I was lowkey sad because I loved Beautiful :(. They had them wearing leather jackets so overall they looked very charismatic and a bit more ""rugged (?)"" than what they wore during KCON LA. They Korean girl behind me legit cried and I was like gurlll..... I should be crying instead of you... Because I don't think I have any chance of seeing W1 again. This time I really focused on Ong and Guanlin. For some reason (probably their height), they really stood out to me. There was not many stage and fan interaction as this is a formal award. I hope they will mix it up in their HK/ Jap performance because I have seen Energetic and Burn it Up too many times.


- **Seventeen closed the show.** They were truly some of the best live performers. They did 2 bsides that I did not know, along with Don't Wanna Cry and Clap. I was in awe. They really stood out and owned the stage. It felt lively but not overly staged. Vernon and Woozi really stood out to me. One of the member was playing the piano to lead into 'Don't wanna cry', but sorry I did not remember all of SVT's names :(. I really should at this point. Being on second floor made the experience more surreal. The choreography, setup was amazingly in sync. However, I had a hard time filming cause they moved so fast lol. 


**Other artists:** Others were from around South East Asia. I highly recommend trying Thu Minh, Toc Tien or Agnez Mo. Agnez Mo really owned her stage. Her songs were pop/rock, and her stage presence was amazing I wanted to stan her from my second floor view. The audience were super supportive of everyone even though I know most of them only know some Vietnamese artists or Korean ones.


**Minor things:**

- I wish there was at least one Korean female act *cough Pristin cough Chungha cough Weki Meki.....*


- There were a lot of scammers. So if you intend on going to HK or JPN, beware. Some fansites were scammed out of $500-$900.


- Despite being an award held in Vietnam, the Vietnamese fans got the short end of the stick. The site (ticketbox) only sold about 500 tickets or so, and the place can hold about 2,000. 300 were given away through sponsorship (cough Clear) and the winning rate was terrible. Some people got 55 raffles (about $375) and did not win a thing. 


- Despite that, there are positives. The fans were very calm and collective. They sat the whole time and I could enjoy the view without anyone blocking. I eventually moved to a better seat and was able to see clearly.


- There should be a screen that showed the performance. However, the screen all had graphics. People wayyy back probably saw like 11-12 faces and shapes.


- I wish the artist spoke more instead of just performing only. 


- I will eventually upload some pics, but if you want to see red carpet ones you can go [here](http://kenh14.vn/truc-tiep-tham-do-mama-2017-wanna-one-seventeen-chuan-bi-do-bo-tham-do-mama-2017-20171125150726882.chn)

If youre in the U.S., hope youve been having a great Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend and been relaxing/enjoying yourself! And for everyone else around the world, I hope youre having a great regular weekend too! Last week was a special themed Jukebox that revolved around interpreting the number Ten in k-pop (as it was the tenth jukebox!). Artists on the Jukebox included SNSD, Ten (NCT), Chen and 10cm, TWICE, and more! The highest rated song of last week was **AOAs 10 Seconds with a score of 8.32**  HEY! Congrats to AOA!

To see last weeks results, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_last_week.2019s_results). Below that is the full index/archive of all the songs, scores, and reviews if you would like to read them!

Its Jukebox #11 out of 11, make a wish ()*:*:

Boy I cant cover up how energetic I am! This weeks Jukebox, as I mentioned last week, is an Artist Spotlight! Its usually the third week of the month, but I decided for last weeks to be a special themed one and for this weeks to be the Artist Spotlight instead. Hope you dont mind! You can probably tell just from the title of this Jukebox who the Spotlighted Artist is ahaha so I dont need to provide any hints, lets just get down to business  here are this weeks songs!

1. [MV] [Red Velvet - Peek-A-Boo ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uJf2IT2Zh8)
2. [Wanna One - Energetic ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVaV7AwqBWg)
3. [Taeyeon - Up and Down (feat. Hyoyeon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5LQJxSoq4w)
4. [BTOB - Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42A-rFdralM)
5.  [Taeyeon - Farewell ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyAYtF2KLxs)
6.  [WINNER - Love is a Lie ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0aKVobaqPI)
7. [Taeyeon - Cover Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn244U2fRKQ)

No, I didnt pick Taeyeon, it was randomly generated, I actually tried on four different days each time to get an artist for Spotlight and each time it was her (Ill put the screenshots in the Other Business section below). Actually, the only song I picked this week was Red Velvets Peek-A-Boo, since 1) we need to review a monthly release and 2) I wanted to pick it haha, I felt like last week wouldve been too soon so well do it this week, and I know that a lot of people have thoughts on this song, hence its inclusion this week! All the other songs were/are randomly generated using the random.org/lists website.

Super brief run-through of rules: leave your thoughts + score as a reply to the comment with the Artist and Song below. You can leave a score between 1 and 10, and you can review all seven songs or just one. Try to be thoughtful about your review, but that doesnt mean you cant be funny/creative/energetic and make your reviews personable! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, youre more than welcome to review the MV as well! You dont have to though, if you just want to review Peek-A-Boo as a song and not as an MV thats fine too!

This june i decided for some reason to watch produce 101 and the rest is history, i've never cried so much and had such a love-hate relationship with a show before. I've stuck with Wanna One because of how much hard work and pain went into the making of the group and i'm glad that at least these 11 got to achieve a part of their dreams!

After Produce i thought hey survival shows can't get any worse so i started Stray Kids and absolutely bawled when Minho was eliminated T_T i think i like how it's more of them working towards debuting together rather than having to fight for a fixed number of spots!

So what's your experience with survival shows and what about them drew you in? ",72,55

Wonder Girls disbandment could have been prevented had they either kept the momentum from their Korean career by not attempting the awkward USA career attempts by molding to western style or if they had created a separate subunit of sorts for their American promotions with idols that spoke fluent English and could promote WG well.

Which idol was forced to have a concept or image that was the complete opposite of their true personalities? Or even if not completely opposite, just different in some way?

For example, Nu'est's JR was given a really cool, charismatic leader/rapper concept at debut, but he turned out to be Nu'est's aegyo king and Night Goblin just [proved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXwsxyNRb1o) how cute he was. He said himself that he naturally loves doing aegyo because he's the youngest in his family and has 2 older sisters, but he tried to be more charismatic after becoming leader.

Similarly, on The Unit, Bigstar said they were given this wild party boy image when most of them were pretty quiet and calm.

On a smaller scale, Wanna One's Park Jihoon made a name for himself by being cute (jeojang and all) but the members have often spoken about how he's probably the most mature and level-headed member of the group and how he always hits and swears at the older members lol. They even created terms to describe his dual personality - 'Jeojang Jihoon' and 'Dorm Jihoon' ",86,95

For those that don't know, this shit show roller coaster all started when Pascal Ent announced the 2 new members that would be replacing Gayoung and Jeonyul before the 2 had even left and made it impossible for them to have a proper or graceful exit. To make things worse, the 2 remaining members (and the 2 girls the weren't renewing) found out about the 2 new members from the tweets of the company announcing it lol. MESS. Since then there has been an obvious turf war between the new girls and the old girls on social media. The new girls both spam their IG accounts with pictures of just the 2 of them in the dorms and training room and the old girls keep posting OT4 stellar pics (Like weekly, its kinda hilariously pointed).

**NCT**: ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get"". It'll always be high quality, but the content varies.

**2NE1**: ""Teach a girl, enrich the world"". One of my first groups. They were very upfront with their equality message from jump, something I greatly appreciated in my adolescence.

that is down 0.343% from Ep 4, People in general have been saying a lot of things about that , ""the unit is better"" or ""the editing sucks"" or  ""i hate Yang"" , basically the show is going to a status where just the fanbases will watch the show then i was wondering what they have to do from now on, 
maybe bring more JYP idols to the show?, 
try to bring G-Dragon, PSY or even other YG idols to the show? 
Change the System of the show competition?,
Bring other famous idols out from Big 3 like IU or etc ? 
Change the editing?
Create new ""Storylines"" like Produce had?",8,1

So many songs deserve more attention!!

Personally, some Id like to see performances of are 

[Wake Up - NCT 127](https://youtu.be/bQ7GMYkf-_c) 

[Best Of Me - BTS ](https://youtu.be/1sAXcpgDErQ)

[Miss You - Monsta X](https://youtu.be/4hn00Y5V9_c) (i totally imagine this song would have amazing choreo, slick but edgy stage outfits) 

[Tickle Tickle Tickle - 4Minute](https://youtu.be/P2BIFxATtrs) (i mean chances of this being performed live are dead now, but the song is SO 4M, it fits them so well, sexy but a little quirky, choreo for it wouldve been so cool)

[Eclipse - Kim Lip (LOONA)](https://youtu.be/_qJEoSa3Ie0) (someday well get a live performance......someday)",74,52

they just announced yet another international tour. while it sounds cool and all, im sure its really expencisve and i bet the members would rather perform at home where they can invite their friends and family to them.

they kinda still have that ""new group hype/mixed gender hype"" but eventually it all depends on domestic support. international fans can only support so much because they also have their own domestic group/artists  they support.

i really like them and i think most people here do too, but in the end its all about the money. i'd be so sad if kard had to take hiatus or god forbid, disband because there isnt enough local success",73,132

* This is the fifthteenth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* **You can suggest only 3 songs.**
* **Each song has to be of a different group/artist.**
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Collabs**!

* Any song that involves 2 or more different artists/groups.
* No sub units. That's for next week.

Here are my contributions -

* [BTS - Mic Drop (feat. Desiigner) (Steve Aoki Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrQN_j4oUc)
* [Yugeom (Got7) - I Don't Know (feat. Reddy)](https://youtu.be/X6j0gTNXb5Q)
* [ZICO - BERMUDA TRIANGLE (feat. Crush, Dean)](https://youtu.be/ZHoLaLlL5lA)

Collab playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdsEFsIe8ElJHFeA5ynMQgkY)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

Yeah theyre cool, but I wouldnt be screaming about how dreamy they are lol. It suddenly feels like maybe Im not supposed to be listening to BTS or kpop when I really see the apparent audience.

I dont know, maybe Im just overthinking it and should embrace being an anomaly. Maybe I just feel left out. Imagine if I was at the Ellen show for example... Id just feel weird.",209,288

2658,2017-11-30,2017,11,30,2,7geuwz,"KPop, Awards, and Sales from an outsider perspective",flowsthead,1511975733,"I recently got back into KPop and I've been reading on this reddit a little bit and on onehallyu a little bit and I've noticed something that I find a little strange. There seems to be an obsession with sales and awards here, and especially on onehallyu, that I don't quite get. I can understand being happy for your favorite group that they are successful, but it seems rather that most people are arguing for it like a measure of quality.

Coming from a cinephile background, this is pretty strange to me. While there are some people that take the Oscars seriously, most serious cinephiles and critics I know do not, and it's even worse for the Emmys. When people talk about best films they rarely talk about how successful something is but rather how influential it is or something about the way in which it was crafted. No one cares that Dances with Wolves won a Best Picture over Goodfellas (i had to look this up since I didn't know who won) or that Amelie or Ran were never nominated for Best Picture. They are still seen as incredible films.

I'm mostly just curious how people feel about it here. Is it just that people are happy for their groups having a measure of success and they are using the language of ""quality"" when they really mean ""success""? Or do a lot of people here associate success with quality? Or is there some other reason or reasons I am overlooking or not anticipating just because of my unfamiliarity?

EDIT: Thanks for the responses so far! This is really interesting. I might give some individual responses later, but I appreciate all of your explanations.",19,35

He is full into Anime, so ~~of course I tried to convert him~~ when he asked me for new stuff I showed him some kpop videos based on his preferences. However, He didn't like it and just thought the girls where cute and very attractive; after that, we kind of agree Kpop is harder to love for a newcomer, basically because It is more relatable ~~despite some animes that are quite weird~~.

Pd: I post this here because among the people I know It's more frequent that the ones who like kpop are also watching anime, another point to my conclusion.",22,0

Does one have to care/support all members to consider yourself a group fan? If you care for the group releases but only care for your bias otherwise, are you still part of the group fandom?
And if a person is hateful towards 1 member but cares for the rest, are they an akgae? 

I often see arguments started because this and would love to hear your thoughts on it. 

I've also heard some individual fandoms even have fandom names on their own, what are some examples of that in kpop? ",31,25
