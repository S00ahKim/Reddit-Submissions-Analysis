Since a lot of music has come out since then, I wanted to see what people thought about certain albums.  If this is a stale topic (wasn't sure if it would be considered that), I understand the mods removing it.

I don't know if you guys remember, but last month I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/68arf5/kmusic_picks_april_2017_xpost_rkoreanmusic/) regarding my favorite releases from the Korean music scene from that month.

Well, I did it again this month, and you can find them below! As before, it's summarized, but you can find the full post on my [website](https://themarginaleye.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/johans-k-music-picks-may-2017/) if you're interested. Thanks!

[R&amp;B / Soul] [Yong Jun Hyung - Wonder If](https://youtu.be/roDYVhQULO4)
&gt;First up on my list is Wonder If, a smooth, sexy R&amp;B single by singer-songwriter Yong Jun Hyung. Yong Jun Hyung is a member of Highlight, a five-man boy group that was originally called BEAST before they switched companies.

&gt;Wonder If is sung from a guys point of view after a breakup. The guy wonders how the girl is doing and whether shes still the way he imagines her to be, whether she still looks the same way she used to. It is tinged with nostalgia and sentimentality, yet it avoids sentimentality to the point of sappiness. Whether youre going through a break-up right now or not, I think we can all relate to the loss and pain of missing who used to be someone close to you.

[Folk / Rap] [Eluphant - Camille (ft. Stella Jang)](https://youtu.be/-Bn_9HUDBwo)
&gt;Camille revolves around a couple: a guy who is a painter and a girl, named Camille, who is the apple of his eye. In the song, the guy says how it would be impossible to paint a more beautiful portrait than Camille because she is the queen of the gallery. Likewise, Camille sings about how the guy is a portrait that she cant stop looking at because it continues to make her smile. As a couple, they wonder if they would look beautiful together in a portrait.

&gt;Adorable lyrics aside, the music video makes reference to many classic paintings including Vermeers Girl with a Pearl Earring and da Vincis Mona Lisa. The wonderful aesthetics are also elevated by Eluphant and Stella Jangs alternating rapping and singing. Its a very sweet and heartwarming song, and I hope you like it as much as I do!

[Electronic] [Wrong Address X Crush - love is true](https://youtu.be/PiLoavoPHQg)
&gt;love is true is a collaborative effort by Wrong Address and Crush, an R&amp;B/hip-hop singer-songwriter part of the label Amoeba Culture. It was originally produced for an LG G6 advertisement; Wrong Address created this remix on his SoundCloud. I couldnt find much else about Wrong Address, so Im assuming this is the only song hes remixed/produced.

&gt;Although I couldnt find the lyrics to this song, I dont think youll need it. Its bounces right along, and youll be nodding your head and dancing to it in no time.

[Ballad] [Tarin - Coffee Ending](https://youtu.be/1LG6fnt3ezs)
&gt;Coffee Ending is a single by Tarin, a singer-songwriter who was once part of the indie folk group Vanilla Acoustic. She left the group sometime around 2014 to pursue a solo career.

&gt;When you listen to this song, maybe brew up a cup of warm coffee and leave your work tucked away in a corner because once you do, you might want to keep it on repeat for the rest of the day!

[Dance / Pop] [Triple H - 365 FRESH](https://youtu.be/8gPQenyj1nI)
&gt;To be quite honest, this song didnt make the list until the very last second. Its not that I didnt like it  its just that I didnt think it was worth sharing with you guys. I might be wrong though. The more I listen to it, the more I feel like its really quite unique, especially as a 1990s-inspired song in South Koreas pop and hip-hop-infused music industry.

&gt;If youre not familiar with Hyuna, she was a member of the five-woman girl group called 4MINUTE, which disbanded at the end of last year. Shes had a solo career for quite some time (she toured the U.S. last month), and is finally back as part of a new group called Triple H. The 3 Hs stand for Hyuna, Hui and EDawn (whose name is Kim Hyo-jung). Although the group is relatively new, each member has their own flair, whether it be dancing, singing or visuals. They all share immense stage presence and charisma though, dominating the stage as soon as they take it.

[Special Mention] [Critic - Lay](https://youtu.be/_FmFPv4GQ44)
&gt;Lay (pronounced lazy) is a laid-back, feel-good song set against the blue and orange background of a late summer night in Seoul. Its the type of song that calms your nerves and helps you relax, especially if you have a lot of work to do.

&gt;Critic is a relatively new rapper, and I never heard of him before listening to Blue Sunset. His album deeply impressed me though: I keep going back to it because of how innovative and hip the jazz harmonies are. Personally, I think hes going to be big.

The weekly Throwback Thursday threads have become ghost towns. Although they were quite popular in the beginning, it seems the enthusiasm for them has faded. As such we have decided to replace the *Weekly* Throwback Thursday with a *Monthly Themed* Throwback Thursday. The first Thursday of each month will now feature a thread with a unique theme to post your throwback videos. 

This month's theme is going to be ""**Breakout Songs**""!

**What is a breakout song?** In essence, a breakout song is a song that put a group or artist on the map; it's the song that caught the attention of the public and propelled them into success. More often than not, the debut songs are not the breakout songs. 

Now, to preserve the spirit of TBT, the ""throwback"" element does have to be preserved. As such, submissions to the TBT should be **at least one year old**. 

For this TBT monthly, the emphasis is on the song that got the group or artist famous. Try not to post their debut unless they're one of the few groups that really has been nothing but a powerhouse from the get-go. Whether it's a crazy-successful solo idol, a group that you cant imagine Kpop without, or a now-mega-famous non-idol artist that you're pretty sure the entire world knows; they all started somewhere and they all had one song that kicked off the success (or legacy) they have today.",55,34

#### Rules on Piracy

Piracy on the internet has been a tough issue since the Napster days and isn't going away anytime soon.  As such, we'd like to update and clarify our rules on piracy so that everyone understands what is allowed and what isn't.  This may be a bit a long and complicated, but it's the nature of trying to tackle this beast.  Our goal is to provide links to the content that you guys want to see and hear while still respecting the rights holders and laws.  First, let's break this down into music piracy and video piracy and talk about rules for each.

* Music Piracy
&gt; Obviously links to torrents, torrent hosts, pirate blogs, and file hosts are strictly forbidden.  Streaming sites are a bit more complicated.  **Unofficial music uploads to soundcloud or other streaming sites are now forbidden.  The one exception to this rule is YouTube.**  Because YouTube offers [""Content ID Claim""](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6013276?hl=en) and respects DMCA takedown notices, unofficial uploads can have their revenue redirected to the rights holder or taken down entirely if the rights holder desires.  If it stays up, it does so at the implicit permission of the rights holder, and therefore we feel these uploads do not constitute piracy.  We make use of unofficial audio uploads on YouTube in our ""Album Discussion"" threads and when songs aren't given a music video or proper release.  We do not want to lock that content away from our users.  Of course, official links should always be used if one is available, but when they aren't, you may submit unofficial audio links from YouTube only.

* Video Piracy
&gt; Video piracy is even more complicated.  Again, links to torrents, blogs, and file hosts are still forbidden for videos as well, but now we also have to consider fan subbing teams and licensed/unlicensed streaming sites.  A simple test question for video piracy would be **""Is this video available on an official or licensed site in the same format (ie. raw or subbed)?""  If the answer is 'yes', then the licensed site is the only site that should be linked.**  Licensed sites are official YouTube channels, broadcast company websites, Amazon Prime, OnDemandKorea.com, DramaFever.com, and Viki.com.  **If the subtitled content is NOT AVAILABLE on these licensed sites, then we will permit links to unlicensed sites.**  This is somewhat unfortunate, and is certainly a gray area, but if the companies will not provide a legal means to consume the content our users want, we are forced to enter the shadows.  Fan uploads on YouTube, Dailymotion, Openload, kshowonline, kshow123, vk.com, etc. are permitted ONLY when the the video is not available on a licensed channel/site in the same format (subbed or raw).

This was a lot of text, but should not change the content you'll see on r/kpop, just where it comes from.  We are not experts on licensing and streaming websites, so if you have suggestions, or if we've made errors above, please let us know in the comments.  This is not a ""crackdown"" and we still want to make sure everyone gets to see and hear the content they love.  Ultimately, our community exists because these artists and companies work hard to generate content for us.  We feel it's in our best interest to utilize channels that support those artists and companies whenever possible so that they can keep doing what they do and we can continue to enjoy their work.  What do you think about these changes?  Let us know!


&amp;nbsp;

#### Stale Topics

If you've ever had a discussion thread removed from r/kpop, then you've probably seen a link to our [Stale Topics wiki page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/stale-topics)  This page is ironically enough, stale, and badly in need of a refresh, but we need your help to do it.  Here's a draft of an updated list of topics:

* What's your favorite song, group, or bias?
* What's your unpopular kpop opinion?
* Things that are overrated or underrated. 
* Songs that don't sound like typical hits.
* Songs that grew on you or you didn't like at first.
* Songs that make you feel [EMOTION] or [MOOD].
* What is your/the sub's opinion of [INSERT ARTIST HERE]?
* Let's make a list of songs about [INSERT TOPIC HERE]!
* ""What song do you like by an artist that you hate"" and vice versa.

* Idols that should join together or form a ""supergroup""

These topics are considered stale because the answers either never change or change VERY slowly such that every thread just ends up being a copy of the previous one.  Of course, things do change eventually and everything is new to you when you're a new fan, so even these may have some merit from time-to-time.  What is your opinion on this list of topics?  Do you know of any more we should add?  Should we remove some?  Should we just set down a time increment between threads (like 6 months) instead of banning them?  Let us know what you think.

#### Throwback Thursday Revamp

The weekly Throwback Thursday threads on r/kpop have become ghost towns.  Although they were quite popular in the beginning, it seems the enthusiasm for them has faded out.  As such we have decided to replace the Weekly Throwback Thursday with a Monthly Themed Throwback Thursday.  The first Thursday of each month will now feature a thread with a unique theme to post your throwback videos.  In order to break out this new format, the first theme will be ""Breakout Songs"".  As luck would have it, today is the first Thursday of the month so you can check out the new thread [right now!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6elh2z/throwback_thursday_monthly_breakout_songs_june/)

&amp;nbsp;

#### Knetz Reactions

Websites like NetizenBuzz, Pann, and other clones feature ""articles"" that consist entirely of translated comments from korean websites.  While this might seem to provide some useful insight into how the korean public feels about certain issues, the comments are often cherry-picked to be inflammatory or fit a narrative.  Also, a translated version of the original article usually isn't provided, so we can't even read what the netizens are commenting about.  We feel links to these ""reaction articles"" provide no usefulness or value to our community and propose banning them.  Do you agree that we should ban them, or do you want to keep seeing them on r/kpop?  If you want them to stay, please let us know why, so we can discuss it in the comments.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",129,57

So, we've done an [artist spotlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4g0rgb/discussion_kspotlight_epik_high/) on Epik High before but I feel like there wasn't really deep info about the group. I know they're not typically ""K-Pop"" in the sense that they're not idols and they don't often make pop music, but their impact on Korean music is undeniable and I feel like more people could get into and really like their stuff! 
 
Also I just recently finished my collection of owning the physical of every album they have put out so I feel now's a good time to make this post. :)
 
#Group Overview
Epik High is a Korean hip-hop group formed in in 2001. Due to the unpopularity of hip hop music in Korea, the group remained relatively unknown for a while. They released their first album *Map of the Human Soul* in 2003 under Woolim Ent (same label as Infinite and Lovelyz). 
 
Their first two albums did relatively poorly in terms of public reception. They released their third studio album *Swan Songs* intending it to be their last. But, as fate would have it, it was a mainstream hit and propelled them into the spotlight. 
 
They are popular for their complex, meaningful lyrics and are one of the driving forces of bringing hip hop to the mainstream in Korea. A lot of idol-rappers cite Epik High as inspiration for why they got into rapping, most usually the song *Fly* off of their album *Swan Songs*; notable one being BTS' Yoongi (Suga). 
 
In 2008, a controversy arose around Tablo and the legitimacy of his college degree. A group was formed called TaJinYo (short for ""We Demand the Truth from Tablo"") that labeled him as a liar and a fraud. The controversy caused the group's popularity to nosedive and Tablo became infamous overnight. Even after getting official proof from Stanford that he graduated from the university, the group remains to this day, still asserting the degree is fake and Tablo is a fraud. Can read about all this [here](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/ff_koreanrapper/) and [here](https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=40913). 
 
Coming off of the controversy, Epik High left Woolim to start their own label, called Map The Soul, Inc. They released an album, also called *Map The Soul*. Tablo said it was a special project, not a studio album from the group. The album is geared more towards international listeners as quite a bit of it is in English. The group released an official studio album *[e]*, which was the last album of theirs released under Map The Soul, Inc. They closed down Map The Soul, Inc. shortly after the release of *[e]*.
 
Epik High released another album, *Epilogue*, under Woolim Entertainment, but did not officially re-sign with the label. 
 
While Minthra and Tukutz were on military leave, Tablo signed a contract with YG Ent. and released his solo album, *Fever's End*. 
 
After Minthra and Tukutz where discharged from service, Epik High released another studio album, *99*, under YG. 
 
Their most recently released album, *Shoebox* was released under YG in 2014. Tablo is now in charge of the label HIGHGRND which is a sub-label under YG Ent. 

It is confirmed the group is working on another album, to be called *We've Done Something Wonderful*. They are also confirmed to have *Pieces, Part Two* in the works!
 
# Member Overview
Epik High is composed of 3 members  
 
- [Tablo (Daniel Aramand Lee,  - Lee Seong-woong)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablo)  
-- Also probably known to some fans as ""Haru's Dad"" after their appearance on Superman is Back     
- [Minthra Jin ( - Choi Jin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithra_Jin)
- [DJ Tukutz ( - Kim Jeong-sik)](http://www.icaruswalks.com/dj-tukutz-100-questions/)
 
#Discography Overview 
Going to go over each release of theirs briefly. I'll include some songs I think are most worth checking out. 
 
## Map of the Human Soul
Their debut album!  This is definitely one of the most ""classic hip hop"" sounding albums. Fantastic mixing by Tukutz, and great rapping (both in English and Korean) by Tablo and Minthra. 
 
- [GO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbYIpuJuaXA)  
- [I Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk-tNX7J9EQ) 
- [Lesson One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_0mNwY-2VA)  
- [Free Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygk5iRUG3Bs)  
 
## High Society 
I love this album. It's just so playful. The theme is basically a parody of ""high class"" and is hilariously well done.
 
- [Good Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYamqlQJyvY)  
Info on this song to demonstrate the parody:  
-- Starts sincere, violins, Tablo's candid ""Oh. Hello there. Welcome to our second album, High Society.""   
-- They give their very flowery, poetic introductions:   
-- Tablo: ""From my life to my heart, from my heart to my rhymes, I'm Tablo.""  
-- Minthra: ""An artist who paints with rhymes on a canvas of beats.""  
-- Tukutz: ""The conductor (like of an orchestra) of the streets.""   
-- And it ends with Tablo saying ""Tukutz... is that *poop* on your tuxedo?"" and Tukutz saying ""Oh... uh... can you clean it for me?"".  
I love them. 
-  [High Skool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6ybJFICFoc)  
-- Where the fandom name comes from! 
- [Lesson 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0HA0SXFmrU)
- [Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRH5e0QQNY8)  
-- Fun song! 
- [ [Too-Too-Roo]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oElKg15SI20)
- [ [Even Alone]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLXcNAeVZTY) 
- [Daydream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DHaK5lL9Sw)
- [Open M.I.C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SFuzisA_mw)
- [I Remember (70s Soul Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0mr7QVRQTk) 
 
## Swan Songs
The album that got them famous! 
 
- [Lesson 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNqIeF0pERA)  
- [Fly (!!!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGRrB-Dhr0)  
-- Arguably one of their best songs. Also, fun fact, it was on the FIFA '07 soundtrack! :D
- [Ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VUfLKUfJc0)  
- [Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbA_mEZfg6E) 
- [Follow The Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDLFxzbP_M)  
-- One of the best hip hop beats ever. Also fun fact, D-Tox is just Tablo pitch-shifted down!  
-- ""Like an empty hospital, I'm out of patience.""  
-- ""Aint a fan of U2, but I do it pro-Bono.""   
-- Seriously, how can you dislike lines like that. :) 
 
## Black Swan Songs
Remix album. Not my favorite, but the remix of Follow the Flow with Drunken Tiger is straight fire. Plus instrumentals.
 
- [ [Photo Album]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAia0W_6r5Y)
- [Lesson 3 Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dYopKZJb7s)
- [Follow The Flow (Street T's Diamond Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGmkPidUK0) 
- [Fly [Instrumental]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Y3xXtMHuA)  
-- For those of you that like instrumentals :) 
 
## Remapping the Human Soul
This was a **very** controversial album when it was released. They touched on a lot of taboo subjects like politics, sex, religion, poverty, etc. It's an extremely dark album and a lot of the songs have been banned from broadcast (on top of the album already being 19+ to purchase). Even with that, it's their best selling album. I love it. :) 
 
You can hear just from the first songs that it's a very different album from all their other stuff. I definitely like The Brain more than The Heart.

## Eternal Morning 
One of the most interesting albums I've ever listened to. This is a collaboration album with Tablo and Pe2ny (like how B2ST sounds like Beast, this still sounds like Penny). It's an album of instrumentals. The booklet the album comes with sets up each scene with brief descriptions ""Fade in. Mid-day setting..."" stuff like that. And then you just... listen and try to picture the scene for yourself. Very cool album. 
 
I feel weird recommending specific songs. Would recommend just [listening to it in full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfPTC91kyKM&amp;amp;list=PLmzjSxnoeEqd1GJHFj8q5LEgMbNtxEcVs). It's definitely worth hearing once through. 
 
## Pieces, Part One
I love this album. Definitely brings back some of the positivity that was gone from *Remapping the Human Soul*. 
 
- [Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmXDmzITC0Q)  
-- This is just a flexing piece. Epik High is back. :) 
- [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=959EPtNnMRQ)  
-- Upbeat but a really poetic song. Would definitely recommend looking up the lyrics. 
- [Umbrella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_1aD9THus8)  
-- One of my favorite songs of theirs. Tablo described Yoonha's voice as ""a nice person who goes through a major hardship for the first time"" on YHY's Sketchbook. Tablo gave Yoonha the song and she released her own version in 2014 under the same name. 
- [Pieces of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IB4eWBqVyk)
-- Song dedicated to Tablo's dad. One of their most heartfelt.   
-- Tablo wrote a book of short stories under the same name.   
- [B-Side 01: Breakdown (Supreme Mix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9pzdxjBkwQ)  
-- English version of Breakdown. Straight fire.
 
## Lovescream
Their first and only EP! Short, but sweet. 
 
- [Fallin'](https://youtu.be/kUyFu_9CeHc) 
- [1 1 [1 Minute 1 Second]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzW9uwfSMv4)
- [1825 (Paper Cranes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHzKU2pyluo)  
-- Okay, only reason I really put this is because the MIXING on the first 30ish seconds is fascinating if you have nice headphones. It really sounds like planes flying ABOVE you. Was really blown away the first time I heard it. 
 
## Map the Soul
Woollim is gone. Onto their own label. The album is definitely a new sound for them. 
 
- [Map the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbxsM9RUtU)  
-- I love the chorus. MYK is great on this track.
- [Scenario Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT5sUf2uPj8)  
- [Free Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mk9SfeXDKI)  
-- They sample themselves! Using the intro of GO (their debut track) and Tablo uses his rap from Breakdown   
- [Map The Soul (Worldwide Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OkiGO7u-6w)  
-- The English version of the song! Tablo does sound less passionate in this, in my opinion, compared to the Korean one. 
- [8 by 8, Part 2](https://youtu.be/IbREAbayofE)  
-- Collection of powerhouse rappers. :) 
 
## [e] 
Their official studio album released under their own label. A lot of collaborations here and again a different sound than anything they've done before. Confession, this is not my favorite album so definitely listen for yourself. It's *huge* and there are a ton of songs. Definitely give it a chance. 
 
- [Rocksteady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA9l8HNV0Nc)  
-- Love this song
- [High Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAJW9JuW-jQ)  
-- Honestly one of the greatest music videos ever  
- [Rocksteady (Korean Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zzH9NzOY-o)
 
Sorry for not many songs on this one. Again, personally not my favorite album of theirs, but to each their own. 
 
## Epilogue
This was the album they went back to Woolim for. More of a somber sound, in my opinion. Not dark like *Remapping the Human Soul* but definitely a bit more serious *sounding*. 
 
- [Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWOb34bzZs)  
-- Fun fact, Infinite is in this MV before they debuted! (Infinite is my favorite male idol group!) If you watch the MV on YouTube, L plays the lead in the video, and Sunggyu on guitar, Woohyun on base, and Sungjong on keyboard. Hoya and Dongwoo also were backup dancers on some of the live stages! 
- [Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ozYImOxzNs)
- [Over](https://youtu.be/vwKiGy2A_nU)
 
## Fever's End
Tablo's solo album! While Minthra and Tukutz were away on military leave (Tablo did not have to go since he has a Canadian citizenship), Tablo signed a 4 year contract with YG. Map the Soul was dissolved and mapthesoul.com doesn't even exist anymore. Somber album that feels decently introspective. I like the sound.

-- I also really like the music video for this song. Definitely recommend checking it out.

##  99
Okay, so, depending on who you ask, this is either Epik High's worst album where they compromised and sold out to pop music, or their most digestible for the general K-pop public. I haven't found much middle ground. It is not my favorite sound from them, but I do absolutely believe it was a necessary album for them and think they handled it rather well. I think their stuff sounds like idol-rap instead of the classic hip-hop/rap their fans came to know and love... however it was a popular album 
 
- [UP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EIYWmRkeRE)  
-- Featuring Park Bom from 2NE1 
- [Don't Hate Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ePT5OlZ7o)  
-- I do like this song, but it sounds nothing like them.  
-- The MV is cute and features kids dressed up like supervillains. 
- [    [If You Love You Should Say It (WRONG)]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFL0Y9E08OE)
- [ [It's Cold]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK-xhoe3nLM)
-- Lee Hi pre-debut! This feels more classic Epik High to me, similar to Umbrella. Favorite song on the album. 
- [New Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEhZJrvjChw)  
 
## Shoebox
Ahhh shoebox. The breath of fresh air after 99. I absolutely adore this album. Epik High is back to hip hop and they're out in full force. Great album. 
 
- [ [Happen Ending]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtPo67yqj60)  
-- One of my favorite songs of all time. It's just perfect. For promotions, they featured a different female vocal almost every stage including [2NE1's Minzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgrIEYAGxis), [AKMU's Suhyun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUOPTiD6QSI), [Lee Hi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK34R5eOss), [Yoonha!!!!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJI042AXUhI), and the original singer, [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuRAe48Qyys).  
-- Yoonha's is my favorite stage. I love her voice so much. 
- [Rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4TA9_I_bgU)  
-- Another Taeyang collab! Great song. 
- [ [SPOILER]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GUlNNXBVg)  
-- Just serene 
- [  [Burj Khalifa]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EA3atBwais)  
-- This is a rap track. Great beat and fun rhymes. 
- [  [We Fight Ourselves]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYnY6XChzok)   
-- Another track with Yoonha! Her voice is beautiful as always. 
- [Born Hater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s1jaFDrp5M)  
-- Super fun, upbeat haters diss-track.  
-- Fun fact with this one, it was originally just supposed to be Epik High plus Verbal Jint and Beenzino. But, Tablo said he just could not come up with a hook for the track. So he reached out to recent YG-joinee B.I. of iKON and asked him to write the hook. Which is when Bobby (also of iKON) found out B.I. was helping out, and asked if he could join. Mino (of WINNER) then found out and begged them to let him on too, effectively doubling the number of features on the track.  
-- Another fun thing with the MV is that it models the 7 deadly sins: Tablo is Pride, Beenzino is Sloth, Verbal Jint is Lust, Minthra is Gluttony, Mino is Wrath, Bobby is Greed, which leaves Tukutz with Envy. B.I. is the pure one (dressed in all white) cleaning up after all their antics. Super fun music video.  
- [Eyes Nose Lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhc_UpS6U3Y)  
-- This was Tablo's official cover of Taeyang's Eyes Nose Lips!  
-- ""The only trophy you deserve... catastrophe."" 10/10  
- [ [Shoebox]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rZI9uJqhOk)  
-- Title track. MYK is back for a feature! 
 
And there you have it! My favorite musical group of all time. A lot of their songs are great for sulking on bad days and just wanting to wallow in your depressed state and just ignore the world, but it manages to do so without being that edgy-teenager sort of feel to it. Tablo and Minthra are great lyricists and Tukutz is a fantastic DJ. I hope you enjoy their stuff! 

Did I miss anything? Any songs that unforgivably left out? Fun concert stories? Do you listen to their music regularly? Would love to hear other people's relationship with them. :)

I really like the direction the show is going and the style kind of mimics what happened with p101 s1 but in drama format. I also like how it's playing up Jiseul and Mint (poor and rich) as kind of a parallel to Yayoi and Iori from the IM@S games (Iori was mean + rich rather than kind + rich like Mint, and Yayoi was kind and poor vs. Jiseul being mean and poor.)

I'm interested to see if they'll nail the Growl choreo or if the Debut team will get another win. also everytime kaeun appears its to make a mean phonecall and im living for imagining her leaving hateful voice messages to ppl @ pledis. Kaeun is definitely one of the ppl whos body shaming kyla rn

242,2017-06-03,2017,6,3,11,6eyvon,Which music show chart system do you think is the best?,endingday75,1496457447,"Here's the criteria that each show uses:

**The Show**

Pre-score: Total 70% [Twitter Voting+Digital sales+YouTube Music Video (Korea) (35%) + Tudou music video views+pay vote items (China) (35%)].

Live voting (for The Show Choice nominees only): Total 30% [Text votes (Korea)(15%)+Tudou votes (China)(15%)]

**Note:** In order to win the group/artist is required to perform on the show.

**Show Champion**

40% Digital

10% Album

20% Melon Online Voting

15% Ranking from expert and professional judges

15% Broadcast

**M Countdown**

Digital Single Sales (50%)

Album Sales (15%)

Social Media Points (YouTube official music video views + SNS buzz) (15%)

Preference Points (global fan votes through Mwave, Mnet Japan and Mnet America + age range preference) (10%)

Mnet Broadcast Points (10%) 

SMS Votes (10%)

**Music Bank**

Digital Music Charts (65%)

Album Sales (5%)

Number of times broadcast on KBS TV only (20%)

Viewers Choice Charts (10%)

**Note:** Unlike the other shows, the scores are not relative (Ex. Group with best digitals will get 5000 points). Instead there are 200,000 available points and it is divided for each criteria by the percent allocated (Ex. Album sales has 10,000 possible points). Groups/artists get points based on their percentages in each category (Ex. Group A had 80% of the weeks album sales so they get 8,000 points).

**Show! Music Core**

Physical Album + Digital Sales 60%

Music Video Views 10%

Viewers Committee Pre-voting (by 2000 people) 10%

MBC Radio Broadcast 5%

Audience Live Voting 15% (for 1st place nominees only)

**Inkigayo**

Digital single sales (55%)

SNS (35%)

album sales (5%)

advance viewer votes (5%) (no live votes)

I probably think Inkigayo is the best since it seems the least bs out of all of them. There's nothing like broadcast points or critics judging that can be manipulated. And voting is worth very little which is a good and a bad thing since it doesn't give too much power to fandoms. Though Inkigayo is very much skewed to those with good digitals and youtube views and this makes it hard for people to win if they don't have either. ",14,44

It seems like SM particularly likes this kind of thing - one of my personal favourites is Red Light, e.g. these [backing vocals](https://youtu.be/iv-8-EgPEY0?t=139) and [harmonies](https://youtu.be/iv-8-EgPEY0?t=152) - but there are a ton of different unique musical styles and patterns in kpop, not just with vocal harmonies either but with how the instrumental goes with the melody etc.

 I have to admit I don't have a lot of specific musical knowledge so I have no idea how to phrase this question or describe these types of things correctly lol, but what are some of your favourite harmonies / instrumentals in kpop that really make a song 'pop' (not in the genre sense) or sound unusual / unique?",45,83

It might not be the final schedule and they might have published it too soon. If I have more information that the line up is wrong i will edit or delete the post, but rn i will just let this warning here.





So apparently SBS is selling all-in packages for japanese fans to come to the show (broadcast station sometimes sell all-in packages for foreigner with hotel / transportation.. so the website has to make a description of the line up beforehand to sell those packages that's why the website is in Japanese, they will probably give information to Koreans a bit later they begin recording end of June anyways) so they had to give a preview of the show/line up of their new late night music show hosted by JYP



Everything in this post is just a google translate of the the japanese official webpage but we can still understand 90% of it

 

Keep in mind that most of the information (tariff, packages,..) is for japanese fans that want to travel for the show:

The first group to go was NCT Dream and they were at the outer stage but I cheered my heart out for my children. They did so good as usual. After they finished, they left the stage and they had to go under the stage so I waved and they waved in my direction. 

After that was Map 6 and Snupper. They were pretty good. After them was Pristin and Kyulkyung winked at us. I died. Pristin was so good. I love them so much. Then was Gugudan and ahhhh these angels. They were so good. After them was DIA who were good as well. After was WJSN, Romeo, April, B.I.G, Sonamoo, CLC and Bigflo. I really enjoyed April a lot and I love CLC as usual. Sorn. Queen. 

Then was the special stage with Turbo and dbdjdjjdjdhdh my god!!! Being so close to Sparta Kooks. I was a mess. After Turbo was Brave Girls with their bop, 24K and Laboum. But then Astro. 

Oh my god Astro. Rocky's dance solo messed me up a lot. I mean a lot. My bias list is shaking for Astro. It was so good. And so attractive. I can't. They performed so good and I was so happy. After them was Oh My Girl who was super adorable. And then, 127.

I need a moment before I start this section. While I love Limitless, I am so glad we have promotions coming up soon. But Limitless was so good. They were on fire. And the fanchants oh the fanchants. They were so loud because EXO-Ls and Shawols were helping as well. But dhdjdhhdhs. Those boys. My boys. They mean so much to me. I held up my fan light and did the chant as usual but man did I miss being with the rest of the fandom in the stands. Taeil's new hair looks really hot from what I saw. Get ready everyone. Taeyong was on fire as usual. And Johnny. His shirt kept going up so you could see his tummy and shdhdhhd. I'm fine really. God I am so ready to see them every weekend for a while. 

After the boys was BTOB and this is when I just hush about their vocals. They are so good. And they love their fan base so much. As they were walking to the outerstage they were saying hello to Melody. After the last song one of the members started chanting ""Melody,"" Melodies started chanting BTOB over and over. Seriously one of my favorite groups-fan relationships.

After BTOB Red Velvet performed and queens honestly. Queens. Then Vixx went and Starlights once again were loud and proud. Then was Seventeen and this is when I admit I started to cry when I saw Vernon standing on that stage by himself. He looked so beautiful while also so sad and yet so handsome. Carats were so loud as well and they were just so good. I love Seventeen a lot. I really do. Then Twice performed. Audio issue during Signal happened. 

After Twice was Taemin and LORD. Before he even went on the Shawols were chanting and they should have been. It's Lee Taemin. He deserves a world. u/Dessidy and I were the two Pearl Aqua specs you could see when they showed the standing crowd. Yes hello. Sexuality was so deadly. This was my first time seeing Taemin solo and his stage presence is no joke. After Sexuality he walked to the outer stage and was talking to the Shawols in the stand. Then he did Press Your Number which should be illegal. Why is Taemin so???

Then, EXO. They were the last group to go as usual so we just jammed out to Monster while the fan sites snapped away. Now I am Chanyeol and Lay biased. I love them. But Kai was my very first EXO bias. He was feeling Monster today and well...he looked at the two of us and winked at us. Kai. Winked. At. Us. I am hoping that a fansite got that wink cause I need it for prosperity. This was also my first time seeing EXO as well. They went to the outer stage and did Lotto. Fan chants were so loud as usual. It became an EXO concert honestly. 

After they finished, the Mcs came out for the closing song and it took a while. I saw NCT and they were holding the fan light and my heart djdjjdjs. I tried to get their attention because why not. Johnny ended up taking to Kai and Taemin and I literally died. 

Otherwise, that was Dream Concert 2017. My very first Dream Concert. Next year I will hopefully be in the fandom seats because I need to be with my people. ",32,110

Meeting another fan in the wild can be difficult, but those moments when you do meet are really exciting! Have you all ever met someone who you were surprised liked K-Pop? What was so shocking about it? 

For me, I was in the hospital overnight with severe pneumonia. I was woken up at 2 a.m. for a CT scan. In my sleepy stupor, I hear the male nurse humming a familiar tune as he was rolling me down the hallway. ""You better run, run, run, run, run, run..."" I paused and wondered if I was still delirious from medicine and lack of good sleep, but I asked... ""Is that Run Devil Run?"" He said it was! We discussed K-Pop and I found out he also really loved AOA and he sang EXO's Call Me Baby to me. It was a really wonderful interaction. He even introduced me to another nurse who liked K-Pop! It was great comfort in my sickness to know I was surrounded by awesome people. :)

**Solo:** [I -Taeyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OrCA1OInoo) - The gentle instrumental that sounds like it's on a radio is a good lead-in to Taeyeon's powerful song. The guitar helps build the song to and through each chorus. Then the bridge of guitar and drums and someone vocalizing sweep you up into the powerful finale of Taeyeon's high notes. I get goosebumps every time.

**Girl Group:** [Hate - 4minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_F9HUTYnl0) - The song opens with Gayoon's sweet vocals over a piano which transitions to HyunA's rap that introduces the rest of the instruments while picking up the tempo. Then Jihyun and Sohyun sing over building instruments until we get to the chorus when shit gets real. People have issue with the song because it sounds like ""electronic flatulance"" but I love the dirty beat of this track so much. The most interesting thing about this song for me is that it has extreme peaks and valleys that don't feel extreme. With this song I get hype and I stay hype. It physically hurts how underappreciated this song is. 

**Boy Group:** [Blood, Sweat, Tears - BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8mUuC3S5_M) - The gentle whisper-singing of Jimin and Jungkook build up to this unique instrumental that continues to build through the rappers parts. Then the chorus comes and the tropical house melody is amplified and never wavers. When this first came out I listened to it on repeat over 200 times no joke.",56,96

edit: i'm really really sorry if this lengthy post is an eyesore, i'm trying to format it more to make it as clean as possible

this is EXTREMELY belated i know, but ive been too busy with school to even keep up with anything im a fan of. im still rushing exam revision before i fly off for a holiday (yay) but this is probably already as much of a breather as i can get until the end of the year.



ANYWAY, i got a vip ticket (at this point i have to say THANK YOU TIMPENI bc i wouldnt have gotten tickets without her) and as if that wasnt lucky enough i won a photo opportunity with twice the day before the concert (vip ticket holders had a chance of either winning an autographed poster or photo-op or nothing at all). photo-op had 500 winners and would be split into 20 fans iirc per photo). this fan account will cover both the photo-op and the concert in two separate sections.

**280417 PHOTO OP**

the photo op was held the evening before the actual concert, after twices press con. i got to the venue pretty early and registered, there wasnt much of a queue since the registration period was over a couple hours so everything was staggered. didnt know anyone else who got into photo-op (all my irl once friends hated me for a day for winning lol) so i just hung around the venue entrance like a loner. 

the time came, we were allowed into the foyer of the star theatre, i wanted to get into one of the first few photos because i needed to get home asap to study (lol). basically went beast mode and squeezed with all the grown men fans. i managed to be pretty near the front of the queue, we were sat down in the theatre foyer and waited again. somewhere along the way i went to pee/attempted to make friends with the kid next to me/everyone kept getting excited when people walked by round the corner thinking it was twice when it actually staff.



after an hour or so the first 60 or so of us were led to another part of the theatre foyer (the place is huge) where the photo op would place and were arranged into rows of 20 for photo-taking. we stood next to this white panel-wall thing shielding us from tWICE and if you tiptoed or look through the panel gaps you could catch a glimpse of their backs. jihyo and tzuyu were at the end closest to us so you could see their side profiles pretty clearly. at this point everyone was freaking out, people tried to get their phones over the panels to snap sneaky pics but security was extremely strict about the no photo policy so pretty much everyone who tried got caught and had the photos deleted.



i was around the 10th person in the second group. we were led in past the panels to the photo taking area and it was all EXTREMELY SURREAL honestly i was so starstruck my mind blanked. twice was right there looking and waving at us. the first person you see is jihyo, whos peering past the panels looking and waving at us as we walk in. at this point i have to stress that the girls fanservice is TOP NOTCH, most of them make effort to hold contact with everyone for a split second at least and wave, to greet us and jihyo in particular looks absolutely thrilled to meet everyone. i was so so starstruck i didnt really get a good glimpse of everyone. all i remember is that tzuyu is very tall, dahyun is really pale, they all had lots of makeup on and looked exactly as they do in photos we see. it was like seeing all the fancams ive watched come to life. 



so the group is split into two rows and we stand on platforms a good &gt;30cm (i cant estimate for shit but um its slightly longer than a long ruler) behind twice. the front part of the group goes to the backrow, i was again extremely lucky to be the first person in the front row so i got to walk behind EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. some of the girls turned behind as much as they could to wave at us. my spot was behind jeongyeon and sana. jeongyeons hillary clinton hair is really smooth and shiny and sana is without a doubt the most beautiful person ive seen in my life. i was so stunned i really couldnt even speak so i just kept waving and staring at her like those romcom movie nerds staring at the main girl. sana probably noticed my incessant staring and held eye contact and smiled with me right until we had to the photographer called for the photo to be taken. the photographer gave us a couple seconds to position ourselves, tried to get us hyped with the usual how you guys doing tonight! kinda thing - throughout that sana subconsciously played with dahyuns hair, stroked her head and only stopped when we had to pose for the photo. SAIDA IS VERY MUCH REAL ok i always hold a bit of skepticism since idols *are* told to display more skinship in front of the camera but holy shit that seemed so second nature to sana and dahyun didnt even bat an eyelid i just died a little inside.



the photos were snapped very quickly and we were hurried to leave. the girls turned around to wave goodbye at us again. i realised i hadnt actually said anything to the girls so i managed a !! (i want to marry sana-chan) before walking away which in hindsight was on many levels embarrassing. no idea if she heard or what her reaction was unfortunately.

i went home thoroughly shookened by how stunning twice was irl.



**290417 CONCERT!!**

i arrived at the concert venue at 11.30 with the knowledge that the merchandise booth opened at 1 but JOKES ON ME the queues were snaking since 9am lol. the next two hours were just waiting and queuing and squeezing with people and sweating and watching things go out of stock. i was really disappointed to learn that the organisers neglected to limit the number of goods that each person could purchase so by the time maybe 60% of the crowd was cleared the only thing in stock was candy bongs. 

fast forward many hours vip ticket holders were led into the foyer to collect our gifts, then more waiting until we were led into the venue. when we got into the theatre the sg fanclub was distributing banners and stuff. when twice mvs were played the crowd fanchanted like mad. a jyp group ad was played too and everyone fanchanted along to the got7, wonder girls, miss a even jyp pd-nim song snippets. we didnt wait for long for the venue to darken and the concert to begin.

exact opening vcr as the seoul and bangkok stops were played which ended in the image of a bejewelled door. with that the screen split in half at the door opening to reveal twice on the SAME STAIRCASE SET AS ALL THE OTHER STOPS (i was pretty shook since i wasnt expecting them to bring in their original sets). they did the opening dance, with jihyo dancing along even though theyd previously announced she was sitting out dances due to her knee injury. they moved on into touchdown, im gonna be a star and cheer up then onto the opening ment where the girls introduced themselves, tried to speak a little english and tzuyu greeted us in chinese (iirc, she spoke chinese at the ending ment im sure). the thing of note here to me was that CHAEYOUNG IS SO SMOL there is literally no other way i can describe it other than smol. security was again incredibly strict about photos so most people only managed to sneak small snippets.



performances were amazing, yes the mr was overpowering so essentially they were lipsyncing but im not exaggerating at all when i say that their stage presence and clean cut dances made up for it. in particular, like a fool was amazing performed live and immediately became one of my favourite twice tracks. id hoped theyd do region specific special stages (since the turbo cover etc would be more relevant and meaningful to korean audiences) but since they didnt do like a thai song or something in their bangkok concert i wasnt very hopeful. other things of note were that momo is really hot and next page had a really cute van set. unfortunately nayeon seemed a little out of throughout the show - during all ments shed ask whoever was next to her to help with something near her eye so i guessed it was because her falsies or contacts were out of place or something. the fan participation section right after the end of the concert and before the concert (we had to play games to unlock the encore - it was a video game themed thing). all the fans were incredibly sporting, some friends were playful trying to one-up each other etc, i was caught on screen for a brief moment after aggressively TT-ing at the cameraman to the ire of my schoolmates who were there LOL.



[i cant insert videos for some reason but will try again later]



twice came out in their twiceland tees for the encore stage very quickly after the fan participation game was completed, did one in a million, then sat down for a photo with the audience but were surprised with a local fan video (dahyun stood up and did her bts fire dance when it was shown, and the girls went somi-ya~ when a shot of her was shown during a sixteen segment). the rest of the encore had the girls roaming around, interacting with the audience/each other while all their lead singles played and they sang along. at this point i was pretty much just trying to get nayeon (my original bias) or sana (who made me swerve so hard at photo op)s attention. nayeon didnt respond much, but sana walked to the left, at some point almost pushing jeongyeon off the edge of the stage (i was seated at the left of the middle section, 5th row) so i just kept doing TTs, heart signs whatever to her. WHAT GOT HER ATTENTION THOUGH was when i realised i kept doing things everyone else was doing, which logically wouldnt get me noticed, so i switched to finger guns. she eventually saw, looked like she was holding back a laugh, and did them back to me and shot right into my heart. damn you sana. afterwards the girls just played around a lot, there was equipment that kinda looked like cannons pointing out from the stage, mina unfortunately stood in front of them and it looked like cannons firing at her ass, sana noticed, went hysterical, grabbed any girl near her and tried to point it out. tzuyu stood around and stoned a lot as she does in their variety shows and stuff.

the concert came to a close after all their title tracks had been played, the screen split once again revealing the staircase set which the girls returned to, not before momo did an OYOYO~ bit and that was the end of it.

sana is now my ultimate bias curse you minatozaki sana.",9,52

Now let's not focus on the songs but rather the packaging and what you get with the albums. I just recently got Monsta X's The Clan Pt. 2.5 and I thought it was beautiful. The shine on the box was nice and the photo cards you get were amazing. 

Another question could be what album you have that came with the most goodies? The Clan Pt. 2.5 came with 2 posters (I think this is optional. One was a group poster. And the other was a random member. I got I.M &lt;3), 15 photo cards, 2 little photo cards (I got an extra one), a written note (not really), lyric booklet, the CD (obviously lol), and some stickers.",23,31

There's no doubt the boys of WINNER are well known and successful but looking back on how I initially thought they would turn out unfortunately I was way off. With the success and momentum surrounding their first album I assumed they would be one of the most prominent groups within K-Pop. Lack of proper management/exposure could equally be blamed for why they didn't fulfill the vision i initially had regarding their careers.",277,145

734,2017-06-08,2017,6,8,12,6fyefw,Appreciate your faves,RvYeri1,1496891792,"With everything that has transpired with T.O.P and Sistar in these past weeks I think it's important for all of us to take a step back and remind ourselves why we all love this music genre so much, why the people in it make us happy and why we will support them through the successes and through the tragedy, why we will remember them years after they're gone.

Do you stan Winner? GFriend? Red Velvet? Whoever it is just like, go on YouTube and search some goofy compliation on them, or go listen to their discography on Spotify. You may already do this (daily for some of you) but, go do it consciously and think exactly *what* is it that you love about them and how they make you happy. Do it so that the next time you see/listen to them you get so happy that they're doing that little thing you love until they do it no more.

This post was meant more for Sistar's disbandment so it may look a bit insensitive with Top's situation, but you know what if you love T.O.P still do that, remind yourself why you love him so that when he recovers, and amidst the negativity you can say ""above all, he makes me happy"" and you can know exactly how you want him to eventually feel.

At the end of the day we all get caught up with the goofy shit that exists in our world; the charts, the awards, the views, but, hopefully, when all of this is over and we're all old as hell we can look back and say, **goddamn i remember i used to be really into these weird korean music, i don't remember much about it but goddamn it made me happy.**",67,232

&gt; There have been so many memories during the past 6 years. I'm so thankful and sorry to the fans who've cheered me on, but due to a variety of circumstances, I've decided to leave RaNia. There were a lot of hard times, but I was able to promote energetically because of our fans all over the world. Though I've left, I ask that you give my dongsengs a lot of love and support for their upcoming first full-length album. I hope you're always healthy and happy, and I'll always miss you.

For example I like Twice but their official Twitter only has official updates so I like [Twice Global](https://twitter.com/TWICE_GLOBAL?lang=en) for news, [Twice Pics](https://twitter.com/TwicePIC?lang=en) for photos, and [Twice Apparel](https://twitter.com/TWICEapparel?lang=en) for clothes.

Personally I really enjoy BTS but a lot of their fan stuff is a little too much for me so if you have any suggestions let me know! Also I really like the Twice Apparel page and would be pleased to see one for BTS and really any other group because I love clothes~

ALSO, by fansite I mean any resource you use like Twitter pages but any site is accepted too",5,6

What's your favourite live performance done by a Korean singer/group?

I'll start with mine. It's a cover of [2NE1's Ugly done by Daesung's BIGBANG &amp; WINNER's Seungyoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6tUkQERwGk). I have watched this countless times and am still not tired of it. Aside from them both nailing the vocals, they manage to look flawless while executing the track. The dark eyeliners look super perfect on them too. Their voices somehow complement each other and I've always wondered how awesome it would be if YG promoted them as a unit (probably impossible tho).

I got to the CJ E&amp;M building quite early and walked around for a bit before I joined the line for the tour. SM had a separate line, and our line ended up winning rock-paper-scissors, so we got to go in first! While waiting in the line both at the info desk and outside the studio, various idols kept walking past. Seungkwan, Jeonghan, and DK from Seventeen, Hongki from FTIsland, Chungha, and members from WJSN and April all walked by really close to me.  
  
After quite a bit of waiting we were finally allowed into the studio. We walked in while rehearsals were going on. Astro were on stage first. I just caught the end of their rehearsal, but they were really cute.  
Hyoyeon came up on stage next. someone screamed Queen to her and she laughed. She smiled a lot during the rehearsal and waved to us.  
VIXX were up for rehearsal after Hyoyeon. They had really good fanchants even in rehearsals!  
The last group for rehearsals was Seventeen. They had name tags and Hoshis fell off so he held it instead.  
  
After Seventeen, there was a break before the show started. I got a Kang Daniel sign from someone in the crowd during the break. There were also Seonho signs passed around, and the girl next to me got one. There were probably signs for the other members as well, but not in my part of the crowd.  
  
So after a few more minutes, the show finally went on air! I'll start off by saying that I have definitely mixed up the order of these performances. Sorry.  
I think **A.C.E.** were first out. They looked really calm for rookies, and waved a lot to us before the performance started. One of the members in particular stood out to me, since he had really great contact with the crowd.  
**Walwari** were next. I'll admit that I have no idea who they are. One of the girls looked worried when the crowd pushed a bit before their performance, but it calmed down quickly and they went on with their performance. Not really my cup of tea, but they were fun to watch and looked like they had fun too!  
Then I think it was **Elris**. Elris might be rookies, but their fanboys were LOUD. Their song was decent and they looked cute in their dresses. A little bit to cutesy for me, but if their fanboys loudness are anything to go by they can be popular.  
**B.I.G**'s song is really catchy. After hearing it at both Dream Concert and here, I'm definitely putting it in my playlist. I found myself singing along to the chorus. They also had an ad bus parked just outside the building. It was covered with fans' notes and messages.  
**April** also had fanboys. It sounded like they had more fans than Elris, but the fans weren't as loud.  
**24K** did really well. They seemed really professional and their song was good.  
**KNK** smiled a lot. It was fun to see how they just looked so much taller than everyone else on stage in comparison. At one point one of the members came too close to the edge of the stage and almost fell. He managed to catch himself and it didn't seem like he got hurt. I also spotted them earlier in the day when they were doing some interview at the MYCM shop.  
**WJSN** were cute. Cheng Xiao really stand out to me, both here and at Dream Concert. Her facial expressions are really eye-catching.  
**Chungha** was so good. And fans started pushing a lot when she went on stage. She had a lot of fans in the audience.  
**Astro** were adorable and waved to us before and after the performance. They also had a lot of fans there it seemed like.  
**Hyoyeon** was so professional when she went on for the actual performance. Now the fanchants were a lot louder than for the rehearsal as well.  
**Daehyun** from B.A.P prerecorded, but went on for a bit dancing to the song, before he got off the stage early to allow for next group.  
**VIXX**'s choreo with the fans is really powerful. I had some starlights next to me that screamed along to the fanchants and waved their lightsticks. I actually hadn't listened that much to Shangri-La before my trip, but after hearing it now I'm starting to like it.  
**Day6** had prerecorded, so they just stood on the stage and waved and smiled to us. Since they didn't have instruments on that stage or a choreo, they just stood there adorably awkward until it was time for them to get off stage again.  
The **Produce 101** boys barely got up on stage before they got off again. They had prerecorded and were just going up on stage for us. Fans were pushing like crazy and I ended up a row behind my first one. And I'm normally good at keeping my spot when there's pushing. The first row only had a rope to mark how far they could go, so they couldn't push back. Anyway, the boys went up on stage led by Dongho, who looked really professional and showed them how to line up. Everyone else looked scared and overwhelmed. After they had lined up security immediately waved for them to get off again, to stop the push. Well, I got to see them for like 10 seconds at least?  
**Seventeen** had no push at all in comparison. They did really well and I waved the lightstick I brought. Woozi definitely confirmed himself as my Seventeen bias. They all did so well and I'll always be impressed how well they manage to sync their choreos.  
**Highlight** had prerecorded their first performance and went on stage halfway through it. They mouthed along a bit, but mostly stood there and waved and looked at us. One of them have a really intense stare and kept looking in my direction. It felt like he was looking straight at me. Their second song was really beautiful. One of the members forgot their microphone on stage after the performance and had to run back and get it. They also kept playing with the decoration on the microphone stands before they went live.  
**FTIsland** had prerecorded both their stages. Hongki sang along for a bit, but mostly they just stood there. For awhile they even turned around and watched their performance. Hongki and Minhwan started playfully pushing each other at one point. They also waved.  
After FTIsland, Hongki was given the award to hold and the other MCs came on stage, along with most other performers. Knock, the Produce 101 trainees, did not come on stage again, and Chungha stayed in the back on the stage. Everyone waved and after a moment of excitement, Highlight were announced winners! I was surrounded by Carats, but everyone cheered politely and happily for them anyway (in between calling for Seventeen members). I was really happy for Highlight, it's really big for them to be able to keep winning after leaving Cube (I can't help but wish JYJ could have been allowed the same...). Most of the encore was the rest of the groups trying to get off the stage, but the Highlight members sang to their song and looked really happy. 
And then suddenly it was over. The stage lights went of, the room was lit and everyone started leaving. It really was a fun experience, and I would go again.  
  
Sorry for the slightly choppy fan account! I tried to write down my impressions and what I could remember about each performance. As a whole, it was great. Go if you ever get the opportunity. ",7,87

962,2017-06-10,2017,6,10,11,6gcwp7,June Town Hall Followup,Kilenaitor,1497061351,"Welcome to the /r/kpop Town Hall Followup. We'd like to update you all on the changes that we've made after gathering the sub's feedback on the topics discussed in our [last town hall](https://redd.it/6em379). Please feel free to comment about any issues that have been bothering you, and give any suggestions you may have to make r/kpop a more enjoyable place.

#### Stale Topics 
Our updates to the stale topics are now live [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/stale-topics). There are a few changes we want to highlight. 

* We now link to the latest iteration of a stale thread. New threads can be added to this list if it is deemed that the topic has become stale. Make sure to check this list before making discussion submissions. 

* We have un-banned two topics in particular: 
 * ""What is your unpopular opinion""
 * ""What is something you like from an artist you normally do not enjoy. 

* Unpopular opinion posts have a new special format that will be applied just to them. The details are on the new rules page. 

#### Throwback Thursday Revamp
To summarize, we've made two changes to Throwback Thursdays that we are really looking forward to. 

* The **first Thursday of every month** will be a thematic Throwback Thursday. The themes can be anything from Breakout Songs to Iconic Dances to Award Show Performances. The topics don't just have to be music related. 
* The **rest of the Thursdays** of the month are going to be throwback album discussions. With the explosive growth of the sub, we've reached a point where the majority of our userbase is not as familiar with earlier Kpop. This is the opportunity to discuss albums that are at least 3 years old again as if they were just released that day. 

The throwback album discussion was proposed by /u/griffbendor in the Town Hall. We thought it was a fantastic idea and had a great success with [the first throwback album discussion of SNSD's The Boys](https://redd.it/6fyzpx). 

#### Knetz Reactions
Feeback on our proposal to ban Knetz reaction sites was mixed, therefore will be not be making any changes at this time.  Netizenbuzz, Pann, and similar sites **are not banned** and will be allowed on the sub just as always.  We will monitor the situation and may bring the subject up again at a future town hall.

#### Titles and Flair
As part of our goal to enable filtering by flair on the subreddit, we are shifting away from hard-entered flairs in the titles of submissions. Things like ""[Album Discussion] XY  Z"". From now on, we will be more strict on requiring that submissions have flair added to the post using the options provided. Again, please **do not** put flair tags in the title of your submission.

We also have some flair updates. 

* We are consolidating the teaser-type flairs into just one `[Teaser]` flair. Lately teasers have gotten more elaborate beyond simply Image and MV teasers and it would be inefficient to try and come up with every possible case. So we're going to just stick with the generic ""Teaser"" from now on. 

* We have added some new flairs to help with filtering and classification: [Album Discussion], [Behind-The-Scenes], and [Interview]. 

#### Machine Translations
We are officially making it policy that articles cannot be translated using machine translation such as Google, Bing, or Naver translate. This is not to make it harder for people to submit content, but often these translations are not the most accurate for a multitude of reasons including poor grammar, awkward vocabulary choices and phrasing, lack of nuance and subtext, and more. Ultimately, we just want the most clear information given out to the sub since we try to primarily focus on news and discussion. If you are unable to translate an article by yourself, please wait for an English-language news site to post a translated article and then submit that link.

#### T.O.P Megathread
The T.O.P Megathread has now been unstickied as T.O.P has officially been discharged from the ICU and the medical incident is over. Any news related to judicial proceedings or otherwise can now be submitted again as individual submissions. 

#### OneHallyu Links
We made a change regarding OH links. From here forward, the only restriction on OH is that you cannot link to them directly as a submission. However, you are now able to link to them in the comments and the post body in the case of discussions, sources, etc. 

Our rationale for not permitting them as a direct submission is because the primary focus of this sub for a majority of the community is to disseminate and discuss news. OH is simply a forum. In regards to Reaction Articles a la NB and Pann, these are insights into the thoughts/feelings of the Korean fans of Kpop and as such can be considered news. This is why they're allowed to stay.

#### AKP (Not) Banned
We've seen a surge in calls for AKP and Koreaboo links to be banned from this sub. Ultimately, regardless of your feelings on the quality/accuracy of their reporting, they are still news sites and as such should be able to be posted on the sub. If you do not like AKP or Koreaboo, simply don't submit content from them. Either submit from Naver/OSEN/Star (often their source) or another English alternative like Soompi. ",51,38

It's a lot easier if you had set goals in the beginning of the year otherwise you might still have an idea what you want to get / complete this year!

For me personally:

#Goals:

My biggest goal for this year was to really focus on Lim Chang Jung. Get 8 of his albums. Progress : 6 / 8 

Complete my Cho Yong Pil goals [  ]

Keep up with new BTS and BAP releases (Rose + YNWA) [  ] 

Epik High - Epilogue [  ] (finallyyyyyyyy)

Akdong's Winter album [ ] (This always seems to be underprioritized in my orders.. someday I will buy it)

Taeyang's rise [ ]

Epik High - The Best of collection [ ]

Anything Blackpink [ ] (lol fu YG)


Then I've bought a lot of random stuff that wasn't part of my initial plan \^\^ I think I've gotten pretty far on my goals so I will most likely reach them without too much problem.",78,52

This completely unsubstantiated claim resulted in death threats being made against Tablo and his family, the formation of a huge anti-fan club, Tablo leaving Woolim, his brother David basically being doxxed and fired from his job, basically dragging Tablo through hell and back. This rumor turned out to be in part inflammed by Tablo's cousin, who considered Tablo a disloyal, undeserving fraud. 

There's so many rumors in kpop, but I'm curious about the damaging ones that have no proof. I'm not too interested in the dime-a-dozen dating rumors, since we don't ever know what's actually going on behind the scenes, but more in the ones where there's hard proof that the claim was falsified.",114,209

Now this is based on talent (your opinion). Not on personality. Because if it was based on personality I would have put Jackson up there but he's not the greatest rapper lol. Also it doesn't have to be in order. Providing examples would be fantastic too.

For my 3 rappers - 
- Zico (Block B) - [Bermuda Triangle](https://youtu.be/ZHoLaLlL5lA) and everything else lol.
- Jooheon (Monsta X) - His intro in [Mama 2015](https://youtu.be/XPd_W82fkGg) and basically every verse where he says his name first before he raps.
- Bobby (iKON) - [HOLUPPP](https://youtu.be/-Tap_zZdkYA) and his verse in Rhythm Ta.

For my 3 vocalists -
- Taeyang (Big Bang) - [Eyes, Nose, Lips](https://youtu.be/UwuAPyOImoI) and his verse in Last Dance.
- Taeil (Block B) - [King of the Masked Singer](https://youtu.be/hygbdeqcXl8).

This is mostly on SMTM but I do see it occasionally here too. 

My thought is that if you're skilled in rapping, it shouldn't matter where you came from. Like season 3 of SMTM was a big turning point to this when Bobby won. It showed that idol rappers should get the same creds because they can equally be as good. Even when Zico became a producer on season 4, he got a bit of hate.

Idk I think this conflict is pretty silly. I believe that I do have a good ear when it comes to who's got a good flow or a unique tone. I tend to gravitate more toward rappers than vocalists. There are good underground and idol rappers. There are even shit ones. 

So what are your opinions on this? You think is unfair that idol rappers don't get enough cred? Or do you think underground rappers got a point?",55,38

1094,2017-06-12,2017,6,12,8,6gogn6,Fanaccount - Taeyeon PERSONA Asia Tour,OwlsWithHats,1497222086,"Encouraged xpost from /r/SNSD. 

This is the first time I'm writing anything like this, sorry if it's badly worded or if I'm unintentionally glossing over things. I didn't feel like writing this at all at first because there are so many fancams and fanaccs out there already, but I was listening to the audio livestream of the last tour stop in Hong Kong today and the post-concert depression kicked in again so I decided to vent a bit. 

I'm from Portland but I've been a Sone for a long time and gone to a lot of concerts including her last concert Butterfly Kiss, so even though Taeyeon said she'd be showing a different side of her I thought I kinda knew what to expect... nope, the concert was amazing but not at ALL like I was expecting. 

She came out *starting* the concert right where she left Butterfly Kiss - the UR high note, then went on a roll with some of her more epic songs - Feel So Fine, ""I"", MMLY, Fire. The whole setlist actually felt really unconventional. She didn't sing any of her OSTs or SNSD/TTS songs this time, which might've been disappointing to casual fans but practically a relief as an old sone who's heard them a lot haha. The only non-album song she did was a cover OST called  which I hadn't heard before but was absolutely beautiful. I admit I had some doubts about how she would handle 2.5h of live singing 3 days in a row but she knocked it out if the park, her voice actually sounded at its most unstable at the *start* of the first concert, probably a combination of nerves and  overhype, but she got over it quickly. 

One of my favorite acts was the ""badass"" one with I Got Love -&gt; I'm OK -&gt; Eraser. The live mix of I Got Love was better than the studio version and her dancing was fierce, for lack of better word. Her body language while singing I'm OK was even more sassy (though sadly she didn't curse for these concerts like she apparently did in Hong Kong haha). Eraser was probably my least favorite off the album before the concert but after seeing the performance it became one of my favorites. She carried the confident vibe so well with the tone, slapped her butt with the ""modeun geol dwirohan chae **taeyeon**hage"", danced on the lightfence prop during the ""rap"", fantastic adlibs... just, damn.

Another fave was When I Was Young -&gt; Secret -&gt; 11:11 -&gt; Why. Secret is one of my absolute favorite songs and when she started singing Why over the 11:11 instrumentals I got goosebumps, it sounded even better than the original.

 Rain, I Blame On You, Fine and Time Lapse were other highlights.

 I'm more of a ballad-Taeyeon type but Cover Up -&gt; Hands On Me -&gt; Stress were hype as fuck, during Hands on Me she was going around the venue on one of those platforms and came super close to my girlfriend who later spent the night going on and on about Taeyeons abs (yes really. I swear she never talked about mine like that back when I used to have them. Tragic.)

And the VCRs! The best ones were when she sang ""My Funny Valentine"" (Taengs english makes me melt tbh) and another which showed her doing drunk karaoke haha. 

Afterwards we were out with some old Sone friends and we started kinda joking about going to another concert, then the next day the girl from Taiwan we had been drinking with asked if we wanted to come watch it in Taipei too next weekend. We said no since we obviously didn't have tickets but she said we could stay at her place for free and pointed us to some resellers and well... my wallet hurt and we weren't seated next to each other but it ended up totally worth it.

 It was my first time visiting Taiwan so it was an experience in itself, we got tickets for Sunday but arrived Saturday so we got a day of sightseeing too.

And the concert there was even better imo. Seoul audience felt a bit more ""familiar"" when she was rolling with the things people in the crowd shouted to her (""date me"" - ""you can't handle me"" etc) and had Soshi members and other idols in the crowd, but in Taipei the audience was chanting louder and sorta jamming along a bit more similar to a western concert. Many in the crowd seemed to understand Korean pretty well too and one of the faninteraction highlights was when a fan asked her to sign (fix) a defective album which didn't had the title text, she did (making everyone jealous as hell) apologised and then basically shaded SM over it making the crowd go wild. The fanevents were freaking crazy too and at the end she also came out for a second ""encore"" just going around being cute and doing fanservice which felt really fullfilling and erased the nagging thoughts about my poor wallet. I had an amazing time. 

-----------

Overall the concerts really showed how she has grown into a full blown solo artist. You know the way she's always ""feeling it"" on stage during the ""badass"" parts of Soshi concerts? That was her the whole time, basically 1st Japan Tour Taeyeon but removed from the quiet comfort of the group, completely owning the stage. Huge difference from her first nervous solo stages. Her gestures, the joking around with the dancers and the band, the funny fan interactions, everything screamed comfort and confidence. It was so heartwarming to see the happiness, she's doing what she loves and it shows, but she hasn't forgotten her place as SNSD talking about her members and hyping up the 10th anniversary. Times are good. I'm saving up for Soshi now but I really hope she gets an encore concert or something. 

-----


TL;DR Taeyeon is a happy and extremely capable solo artist now. She continues to steal my heart and my money and if I'm not careful she might steal my gf next.",12,93

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* Sun &amp; Moon: Electronica genre track where the harmony between dreamlike synth sound and vocal stands out.
* Whiplash: A hiphop genre track that conveys the message that in love, sometimes it's better to use the honest urging words than sweet words.
* Summer 127: Summer theme song that shows the excitement and romance of a summer vacation at the beach.

This could be because of unmet expectations, song structure, out of place instrumentals/vocals or anything else really.

Example: Honey Bee. I cannot begin to explain how hyped I was for a Luna/Hani/Solar collab track. The [teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl6294KO-l4) set really high expectations for me; everyone looked great, everyone sounded great, and it was groovy as hell. Then the [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvYtzE3clCw) came out and I realized that it never actually goes anywhere. It has a couple different parts that start to build, but loop back to other parts instead. The song is just dull and has no reason to be, in my opinion. ~~plus the 2.5-second sax riff that almost never goes away lmao~~",54,64

For me, what sparked the idea for this post was Vromance. I was just listening to their track [Thank You For Being Pretty ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3pCb0pWYX8) and it's so great. I've heard that they're not actually that popular in Korea and that they might be struggling compared to other groups. They're Mamamoo's brother group, btw, from the same company :D

I've loved them ever since I saw their Hongdae street performance of their debut song [ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyuQ5H3cFqM) (I think the English title is ""She"", but the literal translation is ""girl person friend""). I'm a guy and I don't usually like guy groups nearly as much, but I do love vocals and they are top tier in terms of vocals. Plus, I love their song style (vocal-oriented) and their stage presence is just so joyful and they don't rely that much on flashiness or ""gimmicks"", but just pure musicality and a bit of dance.

And then there's [K.A.R.D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWWLZOQKo78). I love them, you love them, but Koreans don't even know who they are. Yet **;)**",130,76

Response:

What's The Problem?

There are people out there who are rating/judging my work that I do not even know.

If it is an album or not an album what's the point?

There are pros and cons about the issue, and we have evolved from the tape to the CD and now downloading files.

Even the world is changing and updating continuously. What should matter are the songs being remembered by everyone. A good song will have its melody kept as a memory for the future, and the lyrics will be consoled, making us feel emotions of sadness and laughed upon even after time, correct?

- He says he's a longtime fan of the group (6 years) and has spent a lot of money on their merchandise and whatnot.
- He sent the death threats because he was angry that Apink members were going on blind dates with aspiring actors, not even veteran actors, on some reality tv show. (if someone could maybe find the show... :) )
- He would call Plan A Entertainment to complain about this show but they wouldn't respond ""properly"" to him so then he called the police and sent the death threat.
- He has no intentions of turning himself in but he also has no intentions of actually harming the members.

Note: This is all a report and it can't exactly be verified that this is the person who actually called in the initial death threat.",35,102

1502,2017-06-15,2017,6,15,19,6hea6y,K-Pop History: Kim Wan-seon (),NomNomKahi,1497524238,"####Kim Wan-seon/Kim Wan-sun ()

####Why is this artist important?

Kim Wan-seon was the first Korean pop artist and still is the only female soloist who sold over a million copies of a single album in Korea. That number alone makes her very important in K-pop history. Like Uhm Jung-hwa, BoA, &amp; Lee Hyo-ri after her (and possibly Son Dam-bi), she completely owned the scene by redefining how women are to be presented in pop culture. Kim's smooth and sinewy dance was nothing like Korea had ever seen at that point. Calling her ""Korea's Madonna"" (as her fans like to do) might be an overstatement, but like Madonna, Kim defined how female sexuality is to be packaged and sold through mass media for a good decade. She was also dubbed as ""the dancing queen of Korean popular music's renaissance era"", as she was/is known for her beauty, clear voice, charismatic stage presence and catchy hits from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s.

But Kim's importance goes much farther beyond being a sexy pop star. Her career is a *prototype of a mainstream K-pop star today*. The process of training Kim, as well as the career paths that Kim took, served as a model for the K-pop stars that will go on to sweep the world.

####Early Beginnings &amp; Training

Kim's maternal aunt was a woman named Han Baek-Hee, who sang  for the U.S. troops stationed in Korea during the 1960s. Han recognized Kim's talent early, and persuaded Kim's parents to have Kim live with her. Kim moved in with her aunt at age 14 -- thereafter, she would not be able to visit her parents for the next three years. Instead, she underwent a Spartan training of ballet and gymnastics at Han's dance studio. Han opened up her studio for any dancer to use for free, as long as the dancer taught his/her best move to Kim. Kim recalls that she was not allowed to sit down during her waking hours. She did not attend any further schooling, was isolated, and had no friends.

####Debut &amp; her Strict Life (*19861990*)

In the meantime, Han used her connection in Korea's growing entertainment industry to collect the best songs from the best composers available. The venerability of the composers for Kim's songs is shocking to those who regard Kim only as a vacuous dance musician. Her debut song [""*Tonight*""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QC68zxOS-0&amp;list=PL_tMubvdAcGQ4p4iGdZDxGE2mzI5PZUhu&amp;index=4) was composed by Kim Chang-hoon, member of Sanullim -- unquestionably one of the greatest rock bands in K-pop history. One of her greatest hits, [""*That Dance in the Rhythm*,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFdEPhvcDRI&amp;list=PL_tMubvdAcGQ4p4iGdZDxGE2mzI5PZUhu&amp;index=3) was composed by the legendary Shin Joong-hyeon.

After Kim's debut, Han controlled every last aspect of Kim's career. Han chose everything for her niece -- not only the songs and the dances, but also clothes, shoes, hairdo, and makeup. At the end of each performance, Han stood Kim in a corner and berated her errors like her singing &amp; dancing, regardless of who was around. (The scolding was so intense that many people around them were convinced that Han was not Kim's real aunt.) Han even did Kim's interviews on her behalf. She also strictly forbade her niece from speaking with any fellow pop musician, men or women. 

#### Success, Career Abroad, &amp; Hiatus (*19902002*)

The first year of the new decade arrived, along with that came a new album, ""*The Pierrot Is Smiling At Us*."" This album was a success all across Korea, in which she was the first Korean pop artist to sell one million copies of an album. Still to this day, Koreans young and old know the words to [""*The Pierrot Is Smiling At Us*""](https://youtu.be/cn9frQYla-g), while some people know it as ""*Pierrot Smiling At Us*""; there are many variations of the song's name.

In 1992, at the absolute height of Kim's popularity, she suddenly announced retirement -- again at the direction of her aunt and against her will. Kim then was shuttled to Taiwan and Hong Kong, releasing three albums there and enjoying a relatively successful career. ([Here is a clip of Kim Wan-seon appearing on Taiwanese television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7-PtTWdUxE). Considering she must have learned Chinese in her late teens, her Chinese language skill is pretty ridiculous.)

Most incredibly, Han never paid a penny to Kim for 13 years, until the two finally had a falling-out in 1998. (Reportedly, Han used nearly all of that money into a failed business venture.) Freed from her aunt, Kim moved alone to Hawaii to study design at the University of Hawaii. In 2002, Kim returned to Korea to resume her musical career on her own, but by the time of her return the '90s were over and many Korean pop groups had blossomed and the Hallyu wave had begun. 

In the beginning of her career she was one of a kind but now she was just like all the other idols. Kim left a legacy on the Korean pop scene and arguably without her contribution many groups wouldnt have debuted and the Hallyu Wave would be virtually non existent.

####Return to the Industry (*20112016*)

Kim Wan-seon made an informal comeback in April 2011, releasing the EP ""*Super Love*."" She also founded her own production company focusing on finding and developing young talent. In the same year, she released [""*Be Quiet*""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hVsObXmM_4&amp;list=PL_tMubvdAcGQ4p4iGdZDxGE2mzI5PZUhu&amp;index=9) featuring Yong Jun-hyung of Beast/Highlight.

On July, 2014 she released [""*Goodbye My Love*""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVHwAUgh8k&amp;list=PL_tMubvdAcGQ4p4iGdZDxGE2mzI5PZUhu&amp;index=6) featuring Tiger JK and Bizzy from Drunken Tiger

She made her official comeback on May 1, 2016 with her song [""*Use Me*""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3KSqdnHhko&amp;list=PL_tMubvdAcGQ4p4iGdZDxGE2mzI5PZUhu&amp;index=2) featuring Ravi from VIXX. Her latest release is ""*Odisseya*"" from November of last year.

####Legacy

As arguably the first manufactured ""idol"" of Korean pop music, Kim's career foreshadowed both the best and the worst of what was to come in Korean pop music industry. Kim Wan-seon would dominate the public consciousness through the sheer force of looks, sexiness and dancing, backed by catchy tunes composed by talented musicians. As early as 1994, Kim took her career outside of Korea and found success. Considering that the first outbreak of ""Korean Wave"" began in Taiwan -- indeed, the word ""Hallyu"" was first coined by the Taiwanese media -- Kim's successful foray into Taiwan is doubly significant. Yet, like other ""idols"" that would follow her footsteps, Kim hardly saw the fruit of her labor and essentially worked as an indentured servant. This pattern would repeat itself in Korean pop music industry, long after Kim faded out of the scene.

#####OP Comments

I wanted to share some of the achievements and legacies of one of Korea's most influential pop stars, who is rarely mentioned in articles about the origins of modern K-Pop. 

Kim Wan-seon not only redefined what a female soloist could be, she also helped usher in a popular era of dance music in the '90s. Even though Seo Taiji &amp; Boys, Park Jin-young, and the first SM idol groups are widely credited for the birth of K-Pop, Kim Wan-seon's contributions to the genre cannot be ignored with her debut and success during a time when trot music and soft rock/ballads reigned supreme.

1528,2017-06-16,2017,6,16,1,6hg6xd,NCT 127 M!Countdown June 15th Prerecording,Dessidy,1497544884,"On Thursday the 15th of June, NCT 127 had their comeback at M Countdown. They had prerecordings for Cherry Bomb and 0 Mile, as well as a mini fanmeeting live on the show. I had gone to Digital Media City the night before to sign up on the list, and I had quite a good number, 179. However, I was lacking in tier requirements. Since this was my first time going to see NCT at a music show, I had no fancard or lightstick.  
  
**Cherry Bomb**  
With the Limitless album in hand, I ended up in tier 6. At least I was first in that queue, and there were people behind me. Then the long wait began. The first fandom check-up was at 1:30AM, and at around 4AM, the first people were started to be let into the building. Tier after tier passed by. And suddenly it was just us, tier 7, and half of tier 5 left. It wasn't looking good. I could tell that the staff were trying, but it was taking long. We tried to be patient, but it had been quite a while since the group before us were let in. I was losing hope. Suddenly a man comes out from the building and talks to the woman in charge of us. A minute later, we are getting in! They got all of us in! I love M Countdown and the staff!
We ended up waiting in the stairs by the umbrellas. You might have seen them in fan pictures of idols arriving at M Countdown. People of lower tiers and numbers were sitting down on the floor outside the studio. From time to time we could hear music, Cherry Bomb was being rehearsed.  
  
We were sitting in the stairs for a long time. Some people were being moved from higher tiers to tier 5, just in front of me. I talked a bit with a Thai girl. Out of nowhere, a balloon bounced past me on the stairs, a Cherry Bomb balloon. I quickly grabbed it, and since no one said anything I kept it.  
  
Then, finally, we were getting into the studio. We saw everyone from the other tiers walk by and into the studio. Before we could enter we had to leave our bags. Then we were in. My group was put in a special area behind the cameras, but we were in. It was crowded and everyone was pushing, but I could glimpse the stage and that was everything.
Suddenly NCT 127 were walking out on the stage. They were wearing their outfits from the retro-gameish photoshoot. They greet us, *To The World We Are NCT, gamsahamnida*. Then Taeyong say something in Korean and we scream. Then Johnny said ""Goodmorning~"" in English. Everyone screamed again. In general, we screamed a lot. Fan chants weren't out yet, and we weren't given anything in line, so we improvised. Which was mostly screaming. And then N-C-T il-i-chil repeatedly during the dance break. The choreo was amazing. Gaah. Afterwards they went off stage and we watched the camera people rewatch their video. We screamed at the screens.  
When they were done watching, we waited. And suddenly they NCT came out again! This time we screamed and chanted even louder, and at the end of the performances there was fireworks. This time they got a microphone up on stage and were able to talk a bit. So we screamed. After Taeyong had said the last words, they greeted again and left. The moment they started getting off the stage we were told to leave. I grabbed my bag and went out.
    
  
**0 Mile**  
After Cherry Bomb I went home and slept, certain I would never do this again. Well, I woke up earlier than I thought I would, so I decided to give the 0 Mile prerec a shot. 
  
This prerecording was mid-day. So we were queueing in the sun. I did get a bit burned on my shoulders because I never remember to bring sun screen.  
Right next to us WJSNs fans were lining up. They had their prerecording just before NCTs. It was mostly fanboys in the queue, quite the difference from our line (even though there were a couple of fanboys in our line too!)  
Anyway, I love MCD. They got all of us in again! This time we were a lot fewer, probably less than half the people from this morning. I got to pass the studio floor this time and keep walking to the third floor, then down another set of stairs, and there we were told to sit. Since WJSNs prerec had not started yet, they were put on the on the floor outside the studio and in the first stair, while we were on the third floor and in our little half floor. While we were sitting waiting, we could hear the sounds of WJSN rehearsing.
After about half an hour we were being moved to the third floor. WJSN's fans went in, so the staff moved us closer to the studio. The staff informed us about the mini fan meeting, but they believed they could only take in 100 fans for it, so I didn't have much hope then. But they also said they would try for more, just as with Cherry Bomb and 0 Mile.  
So we sat down for another 20min or so. You need to be patient to do this. There is a lot of waiting. We could hear the rehearsals of 0 Mile starting. Then we were moving towards the studio. We were allowed to keep our bags this time.
On the way there we saw a cute boy group in blue suits outside, having a fan meeting. Someone said it was MAP6. They came back later with their fans after the recording too. I think they went on a walk with them, cute.  
  
Back to NCT 127. We were in. I was on the right side of the crowd, middle back. Right next to a pink-haired girl if anyone spotted me. Soon after we entered, NCT 127 went on stage and everyone screamed. Taeyong whispered something to Winwin, and he smiled. Once everyone was up on the stage they greeted us. Taeyong smiled so much. Then they got in positions and started. Aaaahhh, so amazing. Mark looked so happy every time he was center. I really like their choreos for this promotion. Taeyong poking Taeil at the end is so cute. They went off stage after the first performance and we watched it at the monitors. I think one off the staff corrected our fanchant a bit too. Then they went on again. Doyoung pulled Taeyong's hair with the excuse he had something in it. Taeyong made an ""ouch"" expression and looked suspiciously at Doyoung who pointed at the glitter confetti. Then they said something about make-up and Taeyong ran off stage, probably to fix his make-up. They got in position again when Taeyong was back and started.  
  
Just to stop after a few seconds when music was turned off. Into position again, stand by, stand by... The boys shifted their poses a bit while the stand by dragged on. Ill add here that Taeil's hair looked amazing today!Suddenly stand by changed to a countdown, and they started again, for real this time. From what I could hear our fanchants were good! We did ""Zero Mile"" and ""Mine, Mine"". It ended with glitter confetti, even more this time. Everyone got some in their hair and I grabbed a piece of confetti to keep. After the performance they got a mic up on stage and Taeyong said a few words before they did their greeting again and walked off stage. And immediately we were told to leave. 
  
**Mini fanmeeting**  
So, the mini fan meeting. There was the part about only 100 fans, but they also said that they might get more of us in. Since check in was only an hour after 0 Mile I decided it didn't hurt to try. And while I waited I got the Produce 101 lightstick from the pop up shop, so that was a bonus! We lined up again by tiers for the fan meeting. There was quite some confusion at first, since Carats were lining up at the same time and place. But it got sorted out quickly.  
Carats entered, and then it was just us, waiting. An hour passed after the check in, nothing. Fifteen minutes more, then we were told to stand up. I could see people start heading into the studio, and queues for other groups were lined up outside the building. We lined up behind them. Staff stopped by, and I think they told us to have something to hold up so we could cover our faces. Until now I thought fans just preferred to do that, rather than being told by staff. At 18, one and a half hour after check in, we were finally entering the CJ E&amp;M building.  
  
Once again, M Countdown staff proved that they are the best ever and got the entire queue in for the mini fanmeeting. We stood in a half circle around the door to the studio, where NCT 127 later would show up. While we waited screaming was rehearsed. Behind the camera there were staff signalling to us when to cheer and when to not.They had a TV out so we could see what was going on. The Eastlight were really cute, and when they walked past us later most of us greeted them. When they showed the short segment with NCT 127, we all ohh and ahh:ed. And screamed of course. There is a lot of screaming involved in fan girl life.    
  
Just before NCT entered we got balloons. I got mine late, just before NCT 127 came out. So I didn't have time to blow it up before everyone was screaming. There were two rehearsals of their lines and us screaming. NCT went to the side I was on in between, and oh did it get crowded. Taeyong went up and talked a bit to the staff as the leader he is and he was so perfect. Then it was for real, and we screamed when they signalled us to scream, and a bit when they didn't too. Taeyong was so close, everyone was so close. They didn't look in our direction until after the filming was over and they all turned around and waved.   
  
This day was a perfect day. One of the best days ever.A true NCT day. As soon as I got out of the studio I went to Myeongdong to get the Cherry Bomb album. Okay, actually I went to Hapjeong, and managed to transfer wrong and went back to Digital Media City first, but then I got to Myeongdong. I bought two albums at the Lotte Young Plaza SUM store, and seven in the Myeongdong underground shopping center. And I got a signed polaroid in one of my albums! Doyoung! Such a great day.  
  
Okay, so this is pretty much an essay. Thank you if you read all of it. There was a lot going on today. And huge thanks to /u/jolaurence and /u/l-autrichienne for all the help!!

I love the song, don't get me wrong, but something about the production makes it sound dated (I mean, it is 5 years old, lol). [I Am the Best by 2NE1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o) is also another song that I think people have shared they think that the production makes it sound a bit old as well. So, in your opinion, what are some songs you think that show signs of age and sound dated? 

On the flip side, what are some song that have aged well, or have that sort of timeless sound to it? This is NOT a thread to bash old songs.

EDIT: So it seems a lot of TVXQ songs still hold up well! SHINee's songs have also held up well too. Might make a playlist of these songs. I'm surprised no one has mentioned 4Minute. :0",120,134

*Blackpink will still be YG's only girl group. 

*iKON will have disbanded. 

*Bigbang will still be promoting with a high level of popularity.



*NCT will do well, but not to the levels of peak Super Junior or EXO. 

*SNSD will have amicably disbanded, while Jessica still continues to be banned from Korean broadcasting channels. 

*SM will debut a female version of NCT. 



*JYP will have debuted a new boy group and girl group by 2022. 

*This one may seem obvious, but TWICE will be the top breadwinner by a landslide. 

*JYP artists will finally be on Spotify music in all major regions.",39,60

IU, Twice, Red Velvet and other big name groups I'll pretty much by their digital music and not much more.

However, when it comes to my nugu groups or struggling groups  I try to buy as much as I can afford.  I've been supporting my makerstar queens Stellar as long as I discovered them and try to buy merchandise. For KARD I've pur gases all their digital songs purchased  official concert merch and will be buying the physical album and more KARD stuff when they officially debut. I just feel like it matters more with certain groups. Twice will be ok without  me buying all their stuff but Stellar and KARD won't. ",34,46

The notice for MuCore went up super early on Friday and I mean super early. It went up shortly after noon. So did the notice for Inki. So I basically spent all of work stressing over my check in numbers. After work I raced to MuCore and I did my thing and got my number for check in. It was the highest number I have ever had for check in. My hopes were low. Then I rushed over to Inki and got my check in number which was better. Then I went home and took a little nap before taking first bus into Seoul because surprise! It's a 7:30 am check in and by 7:30 we really mean 6:30 am. 

I got there and already the area was filled with fans waiting. We got into our lines and got checked in. I sat down after I was checked in, exhausted. Then we started to stand up for the next check: tier requirements. Your tier is everything in SM fandoms really. They wanted the NCT 127 fancard which I already had. However, a lot of people who did MuBank on Friday brought the Cherry Bomb fancard. Because of that, a lot of people got a lower rank. I still got N1. Then they started to give out numbers and told those who didn't have the 127 card to get into another line. I looked to the line next to me and I saw they were being given numbers in the 200s. I knew that I was gonna be in. And I was. 

After I got my number, I had some free time before the next check in so I raced to the bathroom and then came back and found some of my friends. Then the next check in started. I got into my line and waited. Around 9 am, they brought us over towards the building and we sat down. After a while, we started entering the building. 

I was in the seats on the right but I was in the front row. Blessed. It took a while for it to start because the set was still being worked on. NCT was the first recording of the day too. More and more of us were let in and then standing was let in. They crammed a lot of people in that pin. Their souls died though because of the boys. We were given balloons and instead of just the NCT 127 balloons we were given during Limitless promotions we were given NCT 127 Cherry Bomb Balloons. Their names are on it too. 

If this part looks familiar to some of you, it's from what I posted on twitter right after. 

Boys did 1 rehearsal, 2 full takes, and had to redo a partial take a few times. The boys wore their black and white outfits. The screams were so loud during the rehearsal. We went all out. I was surrounded by Doyoung and Mark fans. 
As we watched playback of rehearsal we literally were oooo-ing and ahhhh-ing. The boys were kinda feeding off our energy which is good cause that choreo!!!! 

That choreo is deadly at parts. Like, I slid down my seat because of it. I screamed my lungs out during Johnny's part. He looks at the camera and !!!!! Lord!!!! I love the choreo so much. They go up and down on the floor a lot. The one arm push-up move. They were practicing it months ago and we didn't notice in that NCT Life Mini in Mexico. While watching the second take playback the screens went dead but the music kept playing. We panicked. We just wanted to see the boys during playback. Lol. 

For the second take they did the confetti cannons. As for the kinda partial takes. We weren't sure if they were gonna do a second take or not but they boys were there ready in case. We were all exhausted. And yet I had so much energy just screaming at them. At one point, Haechan left to get something and then he came back and we screamed. The PD had them try different first positions and Taeyong was being so cute. The cameraman also zoomed in on Taeyong's face and he grinned so wide. Baby!!!! We waited to hear about another take and then Johnny yelled to tell us that we're doing it again. Or something like that. I was so tired. 

Before one of the takes, Johnny came out and he was fan servicing the N1 standings. They had to redo the confetti shooting part and that was great because they did it a few time since the boys were confused at what point in the song they were at with the choreo. But then they got it. Doyoung is too pure for this world. He looked so at awe over the confetti. After the last partial take, Taeyong and I think Yuta acted like children. I kicked my feet. 

Johnny was hot so he started to take off his jacket and we literally screamed. He put it back on. Johnny deserves more center parts. He literally destroys it. Please SM! This is his era honestly for center parts and he needs more. But Jaehyun and Yuta are center forces oh my god. Just. Oh my god. It was just so intense today. After they finished, they said a few words to us and then left. I literally left the Prerec feeling deceased. 

We all went back outside because we needed to continue getting our 127 fancards checked. We waited some more and then they brought us under the shade to for giving away the fancards. I got one of the posters for the event today so I was super about that. They said they were only giving around 250 so on the event notice or something but of course it was changed. I got my fancard, put everything away and then went to DMC station to get on a few trains to go to where I needed to buy cds for the fansign. I got there and kinda was confused since I was so tired. I only slept for like an hour. I bought my albums (rip my back) and headed home. Then I opened all of them. Wheeeeeee. 

I'll probably write more in detail about each individual member in late fan accounts. Today I was just happy to get in by some miracle. I have Inki check in in a few hours. I find out if I get into the fansign on my way to Inki actually. But overall, today was good. Happy start of NCT 127 Cherry Bomb promotions. ",7,54

So every NCTzen there was ready for another one of the longest nights for these promotions that just started. This fan account is gonna be fun though because Im including pictures! There are reasons for it. There is also a count game going on in this fan account. You will see what I mean soon. This is also gonna be super long because it was a super long night. 
 
I left my apartment way too early because I decided to take the bus and then walk to Inki. I found out I didnt get into the fansign (and I am actually happy about that because I am so exhausted from just this night that if I did I wouldnt be able to even speak). For dinner, I had an iced coffee because I knew I would need caffeine in order to survive. Drink number: 1 I arrived at Inki and waited on the side until one of my friends came. I started noticing people I had seen earlier that day at MuCore, including the girl I sat next to. That meant we would have similar numbers. We were the only fandom there at that time as well. 
 
Then, we started getting into our lines. They split where they did the lines in half.  My line, 401-500 as well as 501- end was on one side of the gate while the 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, and 301-400 was on the other side of the gate. My line then got split in half because of the underground parking garage that is near the building. After our names were all checked off, everyone sat down. It was now a little after 11 pm. The girls in front of me were streaming Ennana on their phones and others were just talking or closing their eyes. I started drinking a can of Monster. Drink number: 2. Since there were so many people there, I had no idea when things would start. Since my section of the line was sitting, I was able to see the first 400 numbers and that they were all standing. That meant they were starting to see what we all had. 
 
Then, the 400 line stood up. Girls filled out fancards and we waited to get our tiers. I got my tier (N1 as usual) and then we just kept standing. I could see that they were starting to give out numbers. The numbers girl was holding her notebook. After a while, we were moved over to the other side. They reshuffled our lines to be a little more organized. One of the ladies called out for the fan card to be signed so we all got that out. My ID was lost in my bag but I found it after the lady told me I needed it. I found it. No worries everyone. Then we got our numbers a little after 1 am. I saw my [number](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCiQc3lUQAAELMy.jpg) and that sealed my fate. I was not getting into Cherry Bomb. I was going to be in for 0 Mile. Better start memorizing. We waited a little more before they reshuffled the lines again. Those getting into Cherry Bomb were on one side of the entrance while those getting into 0 Mile were on the other side. 
 
The prerec was supposed to start at 2 am but guess what? It wasnt happening at that time. I saw that they were handing out mini-posters to the other side. Then they came over to us and gave us a mini-poster and checked our wrists. I got [one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCfWQqCV0AEbfrD.jpg:large) of them at MuCore and now I had this [one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCifXdeUAAAuImB.jpg). Shortly after, they came around selling lightsticks. [SO I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCiiRw9VwAAGx9n.jpg)! After that, everyone sat down again. We were falling asleep when suddenly one of the girls started panicking. There was a cockroach on the ground. Everyone stood up and refused to stand over where we needed to go. So one of the fan support staff killed it. 
 
The time: 2:31 am. Those getting into Cherry Bomb were finally lining up by the venue doors. My line, fast asleep. I was humming to Dunk Shot because its a good song and the girl next to me smiled since I was doing the fanchant motions. I looked over to the side of the road and saw that there was a food support truck there. Okay. What other fandom was here right now? Just us. Huh. 
 
3:01 am: all of us outside still hear Cherry Bomb. Fate officially sealed. 
3:05 am: everyone allowed into Cherry Bomb are in. 
3:14 am: they moved my line to the other side of the building. 
3:18 am: all of us are confused because fan support told us about 0 Mile check in and then, coffee? Coffee truck?
3:19 am: confirmed from all of us talking amongst ourselves that the boys sent us a coffee truck. THEY SENT US A COFFEE TRUCK TO GIVE US ENERGY! We were so tired that we had no idea what was going on. This was the first time NCT had done such a thing as well. 
 
So then, we all walk in our lines away from the building and cross the street to get in line for the [coffee truck](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCiyoWJUwAQ2ahU.jpg:large). Only there really wasnt coffee. It was a cherry flavored drink truck! We got in line and staff told us the three drink options: cherry coke, cherry ade (cherry soda), or cherry tea. They then called out each drink. I went with the cherry coke and left to get in line. I got my cherry coke, another mark on my wrist, and [took a picture](https://twitter.com/seojohnnyboy/status/876148498860720128). Drink number: 3. The banner of the truck said something along the lines of it a really sweet Cherry Bomb to do together with NCTzen while the cup sleeve said something along the lines of NCTzen who is prettier than cherry. THESE BOYS! Seriously. My wrist looked like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCj-LXPVwAAFrJZ.jpg) by the end of the day. 
 
By now, it was around 4 am. Prerec for Cherry Bomb had ended and they all lined up for getting their drinks. T-ARA fans were lined up for their entrance time. Check in for 0 Mile was at 7:30 am. There is nothing to even do near the Inki area. So my friend who had the number next to me and I walked down to a GS where I then purchased coffee. Drink number: 4. Then we walked backed and waited in the building by Inki before we were kicked out by the man who cleans it. These few hours were painful because we were all just so bored. Some people who did Cherry Bomb stayed around to see if they could get into 0 Mile and if not, the live show. I also bought another Monster. Drink number: 5
 
During this time, Seventeens and Pentagons fans arrived. Pentagon recorded before Seventeen did. Around 7:20, NCTzens walked over to the side to start forming the lines before staff got there. We just wanted to go in. (And if you can tell by the length of this fan account, its not even prerec yet) A few of the lines shuffled over but my line stayed put. One of the girls checked our numbers and fixed where we were in number order. After the Carats left, we were then brought towards the entrance. I had my light sticks in hand and was ready to be standing at the stage for the second time ever at Inki. We all went in two by two and then merged into a single file line. We walked up and down the stairs to the stage carefully since we were all so tired. I walked right to the middle and turned on my light sticks. Lets finally, finally, see the boys.
 
I apologize ahead of time because I was so tired that most of what I saw is jumbled in my brain. Its as coherent as possible. I was in the 3rd-ish row and oh lord. OH LORD ALMIGHTY. The boys were almost all wearing denim and pink. Yuta was sleeveless. Jaehyun wore suspenders. They did one rehearsal, two takes, and the close up camera.Boys looked as tired as we did since all of us overnighted. Boys looked really cute and adorable as always. So many screams for Yuta by me. Before the first official take, the boys did their cheer backstage and then went on. NCT FIGHTING! NCTzens screamed in response. There was a tall girl in front of me as well as the camera in the way of me seeing the center, so this is pretty much a Johnny centric fan account cause I was able to see him. Before the first take as they were getting ready, Johnny actually saw me. Like, he looked right at me. I literally felt my face turn hot cause I knew that look was directed to me. Dont ask me how I knew but I did. Oh I did. I literally melted every time Johnny did his line at the start. Melted. Just yes please. He looked at me again during the song at one point. I died. Johnny just looked so good today even though he was tired. Can I sue him for looking so good? 
 
Taeyong and Taeil at the end of the song got me every time. Before the second take, Yuta kept putting his arm out to tease us. King of fan service this era. Someone needs to collect him. Before the second take began, Taeyong flashed the N sign and we all screamed. Johnny also made this goofy grin before one of the takes. After they finished the close up takes, Taeyong talked to us. There was no mic so it was hard to hear. He did ask if it was morning or afternoon. Poor bub is exhausted. Also, after the last take, he adjusted his mic or something like that and showed some skin and the girls next to me screamed. During the talk, one of the girls in the seats shouted Thank you for the truck! It was delicious! because honestly it was so sweet of them to give us that. Like, what did we do to deserve such angels?????? After they did their greating to us and thanked us, they waved and we waved back. Doyoung did that run, jump, and kicking his feet together in the air thing. Overall, it was a really fun song to watch them perform and I liked it.
 
Then, we all left since Inki staff had to get ready for the live show. Everyone stumbled outside the doors and got on their phones and headed towards getting a taxi, their bus stop, or the train. The long day was over. It was over around 8:40 am after a night that started around 9 pm for some of us who got there super early to make sure we made check in. 
 
I included the entire night leading up to the 0 Mile prerec because its important. Fandom culture over here is intense and long and this night is a good example of it. It was my first time ever overnighting and it made me feel like I was actually part of the fandom. Even though I am tired, and I mean really, really tired, I wouldnt trade it for the world.These past few days have been long for NCTzen. A comeback showcase, MCD, 127 on Ennana, MuBank, MuCore, two Inki prerecs, plus two fansigns in one day. Its been a tiring few days. This next weekend, kfandom (minus fansites) has a break since the boys will be in New York for KCON NY. If any of you are going there, please cheer them on for me. 
 
First weekend: complete.

When you watch their interviews or variety shows or behind the scenes clips, do you take to heart everything presented or statements they say (my fans are everything! And stuff like that) ?  

Do you completely have faith that your fave group's brotherhood/sisterhood is something more than just an image or packaging the company wants you to believe or do you proceed with caution and leave room for doubt?

was curious on what kind of mindset most international K-Pop fans in this sub go about with their stanning. After EXO-M almost disintegrated and I developed trust issues, I mostly stan for the music and perfs (or admittedly the visuals) and try not to get too invested in personalities so much.",213,135

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Anything else is fair game, no matter how trivial or silly.  Remember, you can ask your K-pop questions any day of the week over at r/kpophelp.

Andrew from Truly Daebak here, and this is [episode 23](https://youtu.be/HMykAuK1NSI) of the DaebakCast.

This week, we have a followup discussion regarding T.O.P's medical condition in the aftermath of his weed charges, and we have not one, not two, but three album reviews, with WJSN's (Cosmic Girls), ""Happy Moment"", Chungha's highly awaited solo debut, ""Hands on Me"", and Suran's latest comeback mini album, ""Walkin'"".

In light of the serious nature of the T.O.P situation, I'd just like to say that if you're ever feeling depressed or suicidal, there is always a better way forward. There are people who love you dearly, even if they all feel a million miles away.

If you do, great. If you don't and have questions about Kpop in Korea, especially within Korean military, feel free to ask it to me and I will do my best to answer!


EDIT : No sexual words list request please. I am not going to do that.


For proof that I am really from Korean military, [I took a pic of my Air Force Uniform](http://imgur.com/gallery/gSpm6). Hope that is enough. I am a bit paranoid as sharing 'military info' could get me in trouble (even though very unlikely, better go safe.)


(NO POLITIC QUESTIONS PLEASE)


A lot of them are probably answered in the two posts I made here (and linked above) though, so you might want to check them out.

(They are on my personal subreddit because many sites tend to be laggy or won't connect in military. I have been asked to put this on a blog or wiki. Would love recommendation on where to use.)

Okay now onto the concept rumours:

The same person who leaked that Joy would have red hair before it was revealed today, has also said the concept is a **""[girl crush sexy concept](https://twitter.com/thenerdaI/status/877061614477991936)""**. This is on top of the rumours that came out yesterday that RV had filmed their MV over the 18th and 19th (explaining why they werent with the rest of smtown for jeju) and this person said the final day of filming had a [""club feel""](https://twitter.com/baechuxs/status/876699474772480001), which would fit in with the other leak that its a ""girl crush sexy concept"". 

**I want to stress again that this is just a rumour so all of it can turn out false**

2008,2017-06-20,2017,6,20,21,6idlql,[Discussion] What are some of the best trilogies or story themes in kpop?,ThornberryE,1497960426,"I personally love T-ara and their amazing apocalyptic theme and storyline from their Day by Day era. It was done so amazingly well and I thought it was just so unique at that time. They literally played out the whole Final Fantasy concept with epic hair, motorcycles, and weapons. It was a drama on its own. And I loved how dark and edgy it was. 

Exo definitely played it up with their superpower storyline. Their MAMA era showed each member's individual power and they really emphasized on their unity as one. When the Pathcode teasers came out, I was so hyped that I couldn't sleep and literally waited almost every night just to be the very first few to see the teasers. The teasers were so intense and beautiful (although the actual music video was quite the opposite).

BTS has done it since the I Need U era, but I think they have the best storyline going on so far. Almost every one of their hit songs and music videos connect one way or another and it's incredible. Each member has their own story, their own pain, and yet they are all connected to each other so beautifully. The Japanese version of BS&amp;T just keeps adding more to the story and I love it, even though I don't fully understand it yet lol.",14,33

I only tried listening to big bang and I borderline only liked fantastic baby. That was a while back like 6 yrs ago and then my sister got me into watching running man, a Korean variety show a few years back when it was still at 100 episodes and that entered me into the Korean entertainment world. Anyways this will tie in soon.

I'm a guy so I had 0 interest in guy groups. When twice came on running man for the first time and tzuyu lost the game for her team I thought to myself ""wow that girl is stupid"" but I decided to do research on twice and felt bad that I judged her cause I found out she was from another country. Then I read about her scandal, the one about how China demanded her apology for having a Taiwanese flag which was her native country. That pissed me off cause she did nothing wrong and watching her apology video looked like she was being held hostage by jyp lol. Soon after this I youtubed twice and listened to their latest release cheer up. And holy shit my music world changed for the better. I became a once and I was addicted to twice. 

And remember when I said I hated boy groups cause I was a dude, I initially thought boy groups were too feminine and if my sister liked them then I hated them. Ok well now in youtubing twice reaction videos at the mma  (melon music awards 2016) and I watched EXO react to twice and my eyes kept shifting to this smol guy with orange hair just bouncing up and down while mouthing cheer up baby. So I was like damn I gotta see who this guy is, found out it's xiumin. After that I'm doing research on EXO and specifically xiumin and boom I became hooked on EXO as well.

If you told me 7 years ago I would be a kpop nerd in the future id laugh my ass off.",14,23

While LOO 1/3 has built the fundamental links among the members of LOO and also the basic structure of the LOONAVERSE, Kimlip and two other girls create a new circle with their own colors. Kimlip 'Eclipsed' with LOO to annnounce that the time for the new world has come.

The seventh member, Jinsoul, represents the colour between black and blue. The single by Jinsoul ""Singing in the Rain"" is in the genre of future bass, expanding the musical spectrum of Loona once again. ""Love Letter"" by Jinsoul along with Kimlip is also not a ballad number, going one step ahead of expectations with the top-of-the-notch sonal quality that LOO always bring to the table.

Tracklist

01- Singing in the Rain

02- Love Letter(Feat. Kim lip)

MV will be Released in june 26 , 12 PM (KST)

I can't explain why I couldn't hear the beauty of that song on the record but seeing it live opened my eyes and ears. 

Another example is [Cypher 4 by BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIAHUqN4JX4). I liked it but it wasn't in my top 5 songs of WINGS and I was convinced for the longest time that nothing could beat Cypher 3. Then I saw Cypher 4 live on the WINGS tour and then I quickly changed my mind. Seeing them perform it with attitude and dare I say, swagger, completely changed my mind.

I used to keep it to myself at school because I'm from England and liking music that wasn't English-speaking would've definitely got me picked on/bullied. I'm at college now and a whole bunch of girls in my year wear BTS merchandise but I'm still not keen on bringing up how I like it myself. I used to struggle with being picked on at school so I think this is where the fear stems from?

It's getting to the stage where my family think I have no hobbies or interests, but in reality I just really like this genre that I'm too afraid to tell them about because I don't want to get racist comments on it.

Did any of you go through something similar? If so could you tell me how you got over it?",92,103

Just wow. Love them both, but these were the thoughts going through my head after the third or fourth listens:

* MAMAMOO will probably win over BP in Korea, this seems like the summer bop we needed after SISTAR's absence.
* This is not BLACKPINK's iconic song, but I'll hold my guesses as to how Korea receives it. They loved 2NE1's IATB, and that was a strange place to take their sound at the time, so maybe this turns out well too.
* BLACKPINK's song is more of a concert piece, I feel. Something that will really make its mark when performed and seen live. Can't wait for the live performance in a bit!
* MAMAMOO isn't doing anything particularly new music-wise, but their self-awareness (Moonbyul's girl crush and Hwasa's sexpot image) will really solidify their identities among today's artists, more than they already have.

What are your thoughts on the two groups' comebacks?",4,0

&gt; ""The label will respect ChoA's wishes to the best of our ability, and will come to a final decision after further discussion [with ChoA]. For the present, we have matters to discuss regarding her desire to leave the group, her schedules from here on, and more, so we will release an official statement after we've come to a settlement. We ask that you please refrain from any more rumors and misunderstandings regarding this situation.""


#####[Update 6: Choa posts on Instagram again denying ongoing rumors &amp; explains Japan trip](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVqKQoFFkfc/). [Soompi translation](https://www.soompi.com/2017/06/22/choa-denies-leaving-aoa-love-marriage/) below:

&gt; I knew that with more attention there would be more possible rumors, but Im not pregnant, I didnt have an abortion, and Im not leaving the team to get married.

&gt; There are many people who work while theyre dating. If I wanted to date, I could have just said so and worked at the same time, so I dont know why my leaving the group is being connected with dating rumors.

&gt; I dont have many friends, so its true that he has been a lot of help to me recently. Since dating isnt a crime, if our relationship goes forward in the future, I will say so honestly and date. Leaving the team was a difficult decision I made after a lot of deliberation, so I hope that other issues dont get connected with it.

&gt; They had been telling me that they would reveal those photos so I had been under a lot of pressure mentally, but it actually feels freeing now.

&gt; To explain the article that was posted today, I would like to upload my own photo. The article implied that I had been on a trip with just him, but it was the first time I went on a trip abroad with my sisters.

&gt; My younger sister, who is in her first year of middle school, likes to draw and likes animation, so we chose Japan, hoping that it would be helpful for her in the future. Because I am the only person who can speak even a bit of Japanese, and since it was my familys first time visiting Japan, I had to take care of everything. I had never been to Japan outside of my schedules, so it was difficult making reservations in Japanese and looking for places to visit. I asked my friend, who I had been close with since three years ago, for help. On the days when we had the same schedules, he helped guide us; and on the way back, it was late and we had a lot of luggage, so he gave us a ride back. It seems like the two photos were taken then.

&gt; A while ago, the first time it was reported that we were dating, the reporter asked me about the circumstances at which the pictures were taken, so I explained exactly as above. So I cant understand how this article was written with a headline such as They were in love before the dating rumors as if it was just the two of us on the trip.

&gt; Also, I voiced my thoughts on leaving the team to my agency a long time ago. Two years ago, they told me to take a hiatus and to think hard about it, so I tried that. In the end, I got my CEOs consent yesterday and wrote that post on my social media. Before I did, I showed the contents to the company and even deleted the parts that they didnt want me to post.

&gt; I already relayed my thoughts regarding leaving the team, and I hope the other members are not affected negatively by this controversy. I am sorry for worrying so many people with bad news this morning.

Hello, this is Choa.

I was very grateful and sorry that so many people took interest in my sudden hiatus. This is a bit late, but I want to tell you the reason why I had to rest and the decision that I came to after lots of deliberation.

Since AOA wasnt a team that immediately received a lot of love when we debuted, I had always been grateful for the love we got and I think preciously of it.

Although I was the oldest on the team, Im still very young and I wanted to cry a lot of times while working. However, I know that the reason you like me is because of my bright image. Although I was crying in my heart, I had to look happy. This happened repeatedly, and the more I forced myself, I found myself becoming sicker and sicker.

To treat my insomnia and depression, I tried taking medication and started decreasing my work two years ago. However, because the problem didnt stem from being tired, I ended up stopping all of my activities.

I tried hard to get back to work while thinking of those who were waiting for me, but I felt that if the negative attention of my hiatus continued, this would be even more detrimental to the team members.

After speaking with our company, I am leaving the team called AOA today, and Im going to be cheering on my fellow members.

Over the past eight years while I prepared to become a celebrity and worked as one, I learned a lot of things. I think that even this difficult moment is a process for me to grow. I am 28 years old this year, and going forward, I will be reflecting on my chaotic self. For the remainder of my 20s, I would like to fill them with different experiences that are befitting of my age.

As of now, I am not thinking about doing any work outside of my individual work that was already planned. Someday, when I no longer feel scared and feel that I can show a better side of me, and if there are still people who cheer me on, I would like to return. I am a lacking person, but to those who keep cheering me on and worry for me, I would like to give my sincere thanks. To the members who I have been with for so long, and to those who helped me overcome what I lack so that I can be loved, and to those who loved me and AOA, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.

---Choa

####Summary of Departure Post:

* She is tired both physically and mentally. 

* She has been suffering from insomnia and depression more specifically and even tried medications and a break from schedules to alleviate it. Has also been scaling back activities since 2 years ago.

* After consulting with FNC Entertainment recently, it was decided that Choa would leave the group. Choa said if negative thoughts continued to linger around her about her situation, it could harm the AOA members so she made the decision

* Choa says besides her individual activities that were already scheduled before her announcement of her withdrawal, she won't have any more. (*She is scheduled to attend a solo fan meeting on July 1 through an endorsement brand.)

2352,2017-06-23,2017,6,23,12,6iyu8s,[Question] What's up with the elitist attitude of many in /r/kpop in dismissing catchy summer tunes and classic pop fare as formulaic,PizzaEatingPanda,1498190363,"We're at the part of the year where we are going to hit another wave of catchy summer kpop songs, which will hit listeners with familiar nostalgia and a sense of fun comfort. This is my favorite part of the year because it harkens back to an age of fun kpop when it didn't try to take itself seriously and when it aimed to cater to both high school youth and to older adults.

I was reminded of that when I checked out the recent thread on Blackpink's latest song that has a healthy discussion. I was kinda disappointed in some of the comments on the song, which dismissed it as being too formulaic, too sunny, and also too similar to 2NE1. And these comments do seem to represent quite a large number of people because they're the most top-rated comments in that thread. Moreover, these comments tend to trend frequently whenever a kpop group releases a summer tune that chooses to stick to the familiar and the bubbly.

Here's the thing to those of you who express these thoughts. A song that is formulaic is not a negative. A song that chooses to continue the style of a predecessor group is not a negative. A song that is upbeat and bubbly is not a negative. To many of us, especially for those of us who have been fans of kpop since the early 2000s or for those of us who are simply casual kpop listeners that don't dissect groups deeply, this is comfort music that appeals to a much wider population.

It's fine if a summer-type song is not your cup of tea, but if you're going to act elitist and say that the song is not good because it's too formulaic or too similar to a predecessor group or too upbeat, **that does not make it a bad song**. Many of us more kpop casuals do prefer here also prefer that classic nostalgic sound that reminds us of fun summers and casual listening. It's fine if that type of music is not your cup of tea, but don't treat it as if though that kpop songs that stick to the familiar are inferior.",81,26

Over the years my support for EXO has dwindled since EXO-M is no more. I was a big fan of the Chinese members and still support their solo projects. My UB is Yixing. I certainly don't hate the other members of EXO, I respect their work ethic and talent. However, I feel like I'm only a fan because Yixing is still in the group. Should he leave, I don't think I'll support EXO as much as I did. Does that make me an Akgae? This word has negative connotations for good reason. There are very spiteful and mean fans who say really horrible things about other members in a group. 

Are you extremely bias towards a member in a group to the extent that you would withdraw your support from the group should that member ever decide to leave? 

And is it possible to love a member without being hateful towards the rest of the group?

And are you truly a fan of the group if you only like one member?

Her voice is deeper, she has an impressive Melisma where you can tell R&amp;B plays great influence yet she's able translate it well. The minute I listened to **365 Days**, I was hooked. I had to listen to everything she recorded. Even when the song isn't a particular favorite, the vocal gymnastics she performs ends up keeping my ears in full listen. 

[Hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t-Le80C8S0) is among her best songs. ",11,0

[Voice by Standing Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb3hd-QoZ60) and [Melted by AKMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUCIzn0mRHc). 

I'm a sucker for a powerful, emotional storyline and these two songs delivered that in spades. Both seriously had me close to tears.

In terms of visually appeal, I think [Ten - Dream in a Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4gCv1CifJg) is my favourite.

Lastly, for choreography, nothing will top [NCT U - The 7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGMDJ9kZCA). To be honest, the song isn't great for me (though also not bad), however, the choreography in this was sharp and unique. 

Overall, I think my favourite MV ever has been Voice. It's story reminded me of 'Koe no Katachi.' I definitely recommend it.",83,72

Seventeen and Pledis had to blacklist fan cam operators due to rules violations. The rules of fan cafe such as BTS prohibit the sale of any goods with the idols name or image yet the fansites sell the goods right outside the concert. 

There are reported cases of fansites turning their back on a group or groups. (Super Junior comes to mind). Do they have that much power? Are they encouraged by idol groups? Are these the crazy stalker fans aka ssasaengs? 

Are fansites run by really rich and bored socialites? Who has the money to follow an idol everywhere?

I wasn't sure if I was gonna do a fan account but because it ended up being a historic moment (lol) I though I'd share my experience being part of the audience!

So basically, I got tickets through the SM/MCultour package. My friend got tickets through HaB Korea, and we had pretty much the exact same experience (except SM people also get an SM goodie bag along with the general merch goodie bag everyone else gets. I also got lucky with the random draw and won some TVXQ merch!) But otherwise, it was a very similar package.

I got there early-ish (around 3 for a 3:30 check-in) since my friend had to sign in earlier. On the way down, there was actually two kpop stars who got on the same elevator as me (I'm pretty sure from the group Vermuda). I made eye contact for a split second and was shook for 10 minutes afterward lmao. Now that I've seen a kpop star up close, I can tell you... their skin really is glowy as fuck! Like damn!!

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, when we got to the basement level, there was already people lined up, since you get your place in line on a first come first served basis. They told us to meet up again at 4PM for an optional outdoor tour, or at 4:20 for the official check-in/getting in line. The outdoor tour was alright, but the fun part was going upstairs and seeing the idols pass by. We saw WJSN and Pentagon multiple times, along with Astro and TopSecret. One poor guy from Pentagon seemed to be lost, and kept walking back and forth from one room to another lol. Side note, those fansite cameras are quite a thing to behold in real life. They're basically telescopes. I salute the men and women who suffer daily shoulder pain so that we can know what idols' pores look like.

My group was the last to go from rock paper scissors, unfortunately, but I don't think it made THAT much of a difference, since the global fans that got tickets were some of the first to go in (I was about two rows of people from the stage). After us, there was fan clubs. A lot of people also lined up by the MC platform (Today, Monsta X Kihyun + Hyungwon and 9Muses Kyungri). While we were waiting for the show to start, we watched them pre-record some of their lines (from my view I mostly saw the back of their heads and occasionally Hyungwon's beautiful profile haha). Also, this is the part where I tell you the NCT fandom is BANANAS!! Literally every time NCT was even mentioned the crowd went wild-- and of course when Mark and Taeyong were on the MC platform it was extra wild. It reminded me of that scene in Spongebob during the talent show when Spongebob sticks his hand out of the curtain and the entire crowd erupts in applause LOL

&amp;nbsp;

So, I want to get the bad news out of the way first: Live shows are NOT live for a lot of the performances. I knew this going in, but I was still under the assumption that the idols were onstage while the whole song was playing. The big acts are pre-recorded, and the song starts playing without them onstage (sometimes with people cleaning up from the last performance LMAO), they rush up and perform maybe half of the song or so, and the quickly get ushered off so that the next artist had time to get on stage when live footage started again. A lot of the acts I was looking forward to (Monsta X, NCT, 9Muses) were barely onstage :( I'm not TOO bitter about it (as you'll see later lol) but I just want to mention so anyone going to a live show can know what to expect. Also this is just me being petty, but KNK stood me up!! :( I didn't know last week was their goodbye stage!! I didn't memorize the damn fanchant to be disrespected like this!! ^^(Kim ^^Youjin ^^Park ^^Seungjun ^^Jung ^^Inseong ^^Kim ^^Jihun ^^Oh ^^Heejun ^^Keunakeun ^^Saranghae ^^Yeowonhi ^^^*sob*) . 

&amp;nbsp;

**ANYWAY,** all this said there WERE some great acts that were live (or at least on stage for most of the song lol). Some highlights:

 I was right to be shook by Bermuda because their song [SLAPS!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-oENsH6Duc)!! Honestly the boygroups really impressed me, I liked 24K and TopSecret songs too (TopSecret has a classy part where they go MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! with pelvic thrusts haha)

 The ELRIS girls were so sweet. Me and my friend waved to one girl (Bella) and she smiled SO wide and waved back and bowed. Probably gonna stan these sweethearts just for that haha.

WJSN. So cute. I was there for queen Dawon but Soobin was waving to my side of the audience but it seemed like nobody was waving back so I waved to her and she smiled and waved more excitedly. WAVE TO YOUR KPOP STARS PEOPLE!! IT COSTS NOTHING AND MAKES THEM HAPPY!!

 ASTRO's performance and dancing was great as expected. That person that you hear screaming for Rocky? 'I don't hear one specific per-' yeah That was me.

 Both me and my friend agreed that Pentagon was our favorite actual performance of the show (along with maybe FTIsland). E'Dawn doing the shoulder move was weirdly entrancing.

 I ended up right in the middle of the DAY6 fandom's crossfire during their song. Damn these girls know how to yell;; 

 *sigh* EVEN though NCT 127 was on stage for like, a minute, that was still a highlight minute for me ;_; Hot moments include: The first verse literally being the staff cleaning up from the last perf-- NCT running on stage halfway through and Yuta's expression of ""uhh? I guess... we dance now?"" and them confusedly getting into position haha -- Leaving as soon as Mark's fire rap started and Johnny apologetically waving to us as they left. Not gonna lie, I was feeling a little bummed that I got to see so little of them (...at the time (   ))

 T-Ara's fanbase was loud and proud. The song was great, they were all smiling, the crowd was probably the loudest it was the whole night-- it was good :)  

 MAMAMOO performed the ahjussi song live. Thank you queens.

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of the night, everyone got up on stage. Johnny bowed 90 degrees to every single person who got up on stage after him (Mark also occasionally did a small lil bow haha). Astro was looking for a place and ended up way on the side peeking over people haha. Chungha (another awesome dance) was up against NCT. She was waving to us all up until Yeonjung poked her on the shoulder and started bugging her. Yes I'm emo too.

&amp;nbsp;

Alright. Let me get real with you all. The moment NCT was announced for first win. I was no longer a multifandom thot. I was certified NCT Trash. This is now an NCT fan account and NO you do not get to leave until you properly APPRECIATE AND LOVE THEM!!!

Yuta immediately exclaimed to the members/did a fist pump when the win was announced. Johnny was getting teary-eyed. Mark and Haechan were covering their mouths in shock. Doyoung was really trying to hold in tears especially it seemed, his eyes were super wide ;; Taeyong was of course a mess by the time they got to doing the leggy move haha. Eventually Yuta and Doyoung started running around on stage with their arms/'number 1' fingers extended. Also Yuta started... waltzing? with Taeil at one point. I really wish I could've soaked in more but [I only got 2 eyes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYjN9RYWkAApGsb.png) and also I was screaming Cherry Bomb (truly a moshing song... not that I was moshing lol) When the song ended they gave another short 'thank you' to the audience and left on the side. I left this really REALLY wanting to go to an NCT concert. Btw if anyone has like, clips or gifs/fancams of the win I'd love to watch and relive it ;;

&amp;nbsp;

...And now I'm reflecting on my choices for staying up until 3AM to write an essay-length post about kpop. Good night everyone",28,86

I've anticipated for this girl group to debut ever since I got into k-pop (lol)...anyways, here we go!

I did the usual set up to get into the pre-recording - for YG groups you're required to email at a certain time to whatever you're registering to. When the list came out at night I was near the end (around 100/130) slots. Was just happy enough to get in, then went to sleep. Woke up early in the morning to get ready, saw that the updated the list, and I moved up about 60 slots. Holy shit. 

I booked it over to the venue, which is roughly an hour subway ride from where I am staying. Got to MBC around 9 AM, but check in didn't start until 10:30. I walked around for a bit and saw some staff with YG entertainment bags. They were organizing the iKON fans first. There were exclusively girls in that line, haha. I waited around some people who I suspected to be other BLINKs...and surprise, they were. We all started to line up around 10 AM and officially checked in by 10:30 AM. 

One thing I have to say is that, there were more female fans than male fans there. It was roughly a 60/40 ratio of female to males, which was really interesting, but not surprising to see. Staff gave each person a stamp card and a cheering slogan. They're fucking beautiful. We waited outside for another 20 minutes as they let the iKON fans in first. 

Around 11:10 AM, they finally let us inside the hall. Heard snippets of iKON doing B-Day (spoilerszzzz). Staff handed each person a sticker and broadcasting post cards. All worth the trouble. About another 15 minutes, all the iKON fans left and they brought us in during 9MUSES's recording. They had us all in the seating area as all the MINES were in the pit. I've only heard the song once, but hearing it with the live backing track and performance was something else. Sad to see only Kyungri and Hyemi are the only 'core' members left after all these years, but holy damn they're gorgeous. 

After the session with 9MUSES, I was fucking ecstatic when the video background changed to 'BLACKPINK'. They started to let the first 20 people into the pit and the girls came out! Holy shit!!!! I've seen them twice at two university festivals so far, but seeing them so up close and happy and bubbly just about killed me. They started the first recording with their name tags on, with about 20 people in the pit for a test run. Hearing and seeing it live for the first time was fucking amazing, that's all I can say about the first go. Lots of waves and hearts as they exited the stage to prep the actual recording.

Next, they let everybody into the pit after the girls left the stage. I was pretty much front and center. I couldn't believe it. The girls came out again without their name tags and they were right in front of my face. They quickly went into formation and you could see Lisa switch from her bubbly personality to a focused ferocity in her presence immediately. The music played for just a second and stopped abruptly. It startled Jennie and she made the cutest surprised face ever. People screamed ""AHHH SO CUTE"" (in Korean obviously). They recuperated their focus and the music started again. The energy and presence BLACKPINK has on the stage is fucking ridiculous. I have to warn you guys, if you ever see them live, be aware of Jennie. She shot this extremely intense gaze towards my direction and it made my heart skip a beat. Seconds later she's wearing her huge gummy smile. What the fuck?! Seriously a deadly gaze. Each member got a lot of screams during their parts, but I'll have to say Lisa's dancing during her rap is something else. Also, obligatory Ros floor interaction killed us all. The girls finished and left the stage one more time.

 So as the girls prepared for the last recording attempt, they let the MONSTA X fans into the auditorium, which pretty much filled all the seats. Shortly after, the girls came out again. Jisoo, not expecting all the MONSTA X fans, came out and jumped back from all the people. Jisoo is fucking great, hahaha! The girls come into formation again and everybody cheered Lisa so much. It was so cute seeing herself hype herself up and then calming down into a professional manner. This time around, all the cheers came out louder and stronger. I pretty much lost my voice from so much screaming. After it was over, the members said their thanks and said they had to leave quickly. They looked so tired. They quickly left the stage spamming us hearts and waves. God damn, what a wonderful group. 

If I had to describe Ros after all this, she's the embodiment of flowers and sunshine. Her smile is damn radiant. 

also just found out i got into the inkigayo recordings, i'll make one for those too if people are interested.

2502,2017-06-24,2017,6,24,17,6j739t,Origin of the Random Dance Game?,kulcoria,1498292261,"It's really fascinating how an entirely new type of group pastime came into existence even without our knowing it. It wasn't immediately obvious this game existed only for kpop, but so far, I have not been able to find any examples that weren't for kpop songs. Did the random dance game originate from the kpop fan culture? Here's what I found so far. 

The oldest video of the random dance game I could find was from January 2015, at [Taiyou Con 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ORTE1wmvpI), and back then, it was called 33 K-Pop Dances in 21 Minutes  or kpop game. 

People apparently found this interesting, because Kpop Con Miami 2015 [also had one ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoy8EHvvfGc) in Jun 20, 2015. (still called 5 K-Pop Dances in 21 Minutes)

And then it was taken up at [KCON 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9O_ARu5BlU), now called 27 K-Pop Dances in 18 Minutes. (So now we are calling it ""X K-pop dances in X minutes"" ). 

After that it apparently kind of blew up, becoming a fixed must have event in any kpop related meetup, and even many anime related expos. It's now called a number of things, but the consensus is that it has the word Random and Dance in it, and it points to the same thing. (Just search Random Dance on youtube, and you get only kpop results) 

I think the non competitive atmosphere that allows noobs and veterans alike to show off their skills (however hard or lazily acquired) without the stress of being in front of a huge audience but rather similar minded party-goers had a big impact on its broad appeal.  Plus, the game can easily be adjusted to new trends by just changing up the playlist. 

If you have any thoughts or findings that can add to the knowledge about this newborn sport, then please contribute! ",6,4

**BTS** - Personal; mainly got it from being impressed in how [personal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j1xf69jXz0) the lyrics are from WINGS

**Shinee** - Consistent; Shinee as a group just gives me a feeling of consistency in how long they've [been around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTASffPQGhY) and [stuck together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJua7KEP_oE) while creating music with a distinct ""Shinee"" sound. I can't really describe aptly why I think so though. 

**Mamamoo** - Versatile; They can pull off [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvF6GUvLo7g) / [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70bxiaAXx9w) / [musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFuJAIMQjHk) / [styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbhmTM1cRro) without feeling forced its always a pleasure to hear their records.

**Red Velvet** - Playful; definitely the word that comes to my mind when I hear [RV songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glXgSSOKlls), using ""cute"" would be inaccurate since play around with other vibes which I really love.

**EDIT**: Improved the post's format. Also if you like, post some tracks that showcases the words you chose, I added mines also. I don't mind hearing new tracks at all!

Also what music player do you use to listen to Kpop? I use Spotify atm but are the better ones that are specifically dedicated to Kpop that can be accessed internationally (eg. Not Melon)?

2530,2017-06-24,2017,6,24,23,6j8gez,My experience at KCON NY 2017 Day 1 (from someone semi new to KPOP),mightyeggroll,1498314981,"Backstory: I became actively interested in kpop last month. Before that, I used to listen to the old big groups here and there (T-ARA, Wonder Girls, SNSD) and followed TWICE's singles since Cheer Up. I got really interested when I saw dance practices of GFRIEND's Rough and Navillera, and immediately felt like stanning them. They were the first group that I followed and realized there was more to KPop than the music. They could sing, they could dance, and they could be cute dorks off stage. 

Found out that GFRIEND was performing at KCON NY(*NJ*), so I got a ticket to it as a high school graduation gift (thanks kuya!). I knew that Yerin wasnt going to be there due to filming commitments for Law of Jungle, but I still needed to see GFRIEND. I didn't know most of the boy groups on Day 1 (excluding Zion.T, I've listened to his latest EP and it was smooth as butter), so it was gonna be a wild ride for me.

[Here's a picture of where I sat](http://i.imgur.com/ulcWUJlh.jpg) 

That pic was taken around 6:50-7:00 PM, so people started to fill the seats.

**PRE-SHOW**: The MC introduced us to the two PR reps for the 2018 Winter Olympics in SK. They explained how fun SK is, then brought in two animal mascots. MC got five people from the crowd for a dance battle. Each contestant danced to different songs (Russian Roulette, TT, Blood Sweat and Tears, and an EXO song I think?). Second place winner won a Go Pro and a a ticket to stay at a resort near the Winter Olympics.

First Place went to Ellen Min (**OF UCLA KOREOS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**) and that was cool.

**START**: By the time the show started, my section/the section facing the stage was packed, the sections to the sides of the stage were 60% filled, any sections in the corners of the Prudential Center were just empty. Is it because of the lineup? 

Anyway, KNK started the show and they were great! They did three songs with an MC part after the first song. My favorite performance was Knock. The crowd reaction was good. Heard girls screaming for them, so that's a good sign.

**SINB!!!!** and a member of SF9 (sorry I really don't remember the names of the Boy group members I'm new to them don't hate) introduced Yuju and a member of HIGHLIGHT (pls no hate I don't remember) singing [Beauty and the Beast](https://streamable.com/tqjcm). And it was just beautiful. Both of their vocals were on point.

**SF9** was up next. Did one song, and introduced the Fortune Wheel. The wheel was spun on the screen and three members had to propose or confess their love to a member of the audience (the camera was focused on them on the main stage screens, she was crying happily). One member did the aegyo song, another sang Just the Way You Are, and the last did a mixture of both. Member of the audience picked all three of them, which I guess they didnt expect, so they walked and danced around the standing crowd and IIRC took selfies with them. They performed two more songs and that was it.

And the moment I've been waiting for, **GFRIEND**!!!! When they came out, my heart started pumping at 600 BPM, like legit fast. This only once before (when AJ Styles debuted in WWE), but I couldnt believe I was seeing the group that really got me into KPOP, **LIVE** (sans Yerin, but I SAW THEM LIVE)

[Gfriend Intro](https://streamable.com/3wzdk)

[THEY DID FINGERTIP](https://streamable.com/9l1lc) (yes, that is me doing the TANG TANG TANG FINGERTIP. I probably sound like BTOB's Changsub's long lost cousin(I can sing well when I'm calm), but I was still eccstatic because I was seeing them. (Was also on the verge of crying like jesu)

They then did their introduction segment and I GOT TO SEE EUNHA (the ultra bias) BE EXTRA CUTESY MY HEART WAS WAS ABOUT TO GO TO CARDIAC ARREST GAAAAHHHH

THEY THEN DID Navillera. I recorded that too, but I know you dont want to hear me butcher the chorus with my hoarse voice.

I don't remember which one they did first, but they then did Rough and Me gustas tu. When they announced they were doing [me gustas tu](https://twitter.com/Kineva_/status/878413631838449664)(I KNOW I WAS SUPER OFF KEY BUT I CANT SING NORMALLY WHEN IM SUPER EXCITED), the crowd popped and were happy for it being performed (especially me). After their set ended, my heart was still racing, like GAAAAHHH.

I'd like to note that the group did well even though Yerin couldnt be there. Yuju or SinB sang Yerin's for some songs, and the choreo for the four songs were adjusted for five members instead of six. 

SF9 (KCON really giving them the push this year) did a special stage, doing a cover medley of CALL ME BABY BY EXO and a Block B song. Fantastic!

Zion.T was up next and his voice was so godly. He was the only act that I noticed to sing with a live mic (you really need to hear him live). He did a piano medley, Eat, The Song, and Yanghwa Bridge. Buttery smooth.

[Yuju and Umji spoke English to talk about the Winter Olympics and to introduce HIGHLIGHT](https://twitter.com/Kineva_/status/878419803605696513). I'm really impressed with both of their English! I knew that Umji had good English, but Yuju seems to be improving, they sounded nearly fluent!

HIGHLIGHT was the last act and they were a blast to see. I wasnt really interested in boy groups, but after seeing a lot of them during KCON, I have a new found appreciation for them. Highlight did three or four songs and they were all amazing. Oh, they also took a giant selfie of the crowd. There was a Korean cameraman coming down the aisles in the audience for some up close audience member shots and I'm pretty sure he got a shot of me. So if you see a dude in a black tee with a picture of Kermit wearing a Supreme t shirt on it during one of Mnet's videos of HIGHLIGHT during KCON, that's probably me.

Concert ended with all the acts coming out on the stage. 

[Gfriend came out and Rough started playing, and you know what I had to do](https://twitter.com/Kineva_/status/878427686301040644) 

All in all, it was a fun experience. I got to see the group that got me really into Kpop, and I got to see groups that I now have some interest in. 

I wanted to go to day 2 for TWICE, but as I'm writing this on my phone, I have a wedding to attend. Kinda salty, but hopefully they'll be at KCON LA, this year. Or next year.",17,46

**[SOURCE](https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/posts/440312263012971:0)**

&gt;LOO is a k-pop group building its own unique universe.

&gt;The story of LOO started with its first girl, HeeJin. Then HyunJin, a close friend and a schoolmate of HeeJin, joined LOO.
HaSeul, who always seems to cause rain wherever she goes, and the youngest member YeoJin, who hops around everywhere like a noisy frog joined along.

&gt;An android from Hong Kong, ViVi was introduced to complete LOO's first milestone, LOO 1/3. As they pass through the endless forest created with 'Love&amp;Live' and 'Love&amp;Evil', LOO's universe kept on expanding.

&gt;Each girl meets another girl like building 'blocks' stacking, and the encounters of each girl creates new synergies to bear 'berries'.
The structure built by these young innocent girls eclipsed with Kim Lip's appearance to show a different side of what they had built.

&gt;Now, the introduction of a new girl draws a even bigger circle now.
JinSoul is the girl of this month.

&gt;JinSoul had caught the eyes of the fans first with ViVi's help during their encounter in Hong Kong. She finally joins LOO with her new single, 'Singing in the Rain'.

&gt;Dressed in a blue school uniform, she brings a future bass track, 'Singing in the Rain' to show her colors to the fullest. The track fires up speakers with its accelerating tempo like a pulsating heart in excitement.

&gt;The title of the supporting track 'Love Letter' performed by JinSoul and Kim Lip sounds like a ballad number, but it actually is a track full of groove, created from the clash of the two girls with their unique and distinct styles.

&gt;Now with its progress just over half way, the universe of LOO strengthens more and more to show its real potential. Kim Lip, JinSoul, and the next girl to come will form a new unit to add colors very different from what LOO 1/3 has brought.

&gt;As it was mentioned in LOO TV, about 50 trainees are training hard under the name of 'LOOTIO' as candidates for the last four slots in the third unit of LOO, which will expand the universe with its whole new spectrum once again.",54,93

So this prerecording was quite the pain in the ass. Check in was at 1:30 AM. I had a really good number today so I was looking forward to it. It was about the same as music core for checking in - got all the goodies again (slogan towel, postcards, stamp card). There were more males than at music core considering how late the recording was. They let us in around 2:40 AM. 

When I walked in the stage was gorgeous. It was decorated with dangling ornaments, melted pink hearts, and a huuuge BLACKPINK sign hanging overhead. The members came out from the left and I had a good center position in front of the stage. After one song, they moved me over to the side because I was too tall. Feels bad man. I was still in the front though, so no big deal. 

When they first came out, they were required to maintain an intense stare and presence with the logo right above their heads. It lasted for five minutes, but it was just funny seeing them act so serious for the camera shots. They all took a deep breath when it was done. In total, they did 5 performances, which were all spot on and intense. So, I'll detail more about the random interactions the members had with the audience throughout the entire recording!

- Jennie responded whenever she felt like it. Most of the time she looked really tired and weary, which is understandable since it was 3 AM. One of the fans did a finger gun motion to her and she responded by making a really cute ""I got shot"" face. When she responds with the crowd, she's very playful.

- Jisoo is all smiles. She recognized the fans they attend her MC recording and was responsive. She made a lot of silly faces and hearts just like the goofball she is. Otherwise, she was really chic and chill.

- Lisa! Lisa is just so bubbly. Every time somebody complimented her, she's would shyly say thank you and just do all sorts of cute things. The fans freaking love her. A male fan near me kept yelling ""yo LISA!"" to her and she did this gangster thing back like ""yo wassup"". She's tons of fun, haha. 

- Ros. Ros by far gives the most fan service of all the members. She kept asking us if we slept and ate and was generally responsive to all the fans that called out to her. One thing that took me by surprise was when a lot of the males called her 'noona', which was pretty crazy since she's born 1997, and that meant there were kids younger than her there at 3 AM?! Overall, I think I paid the most attention to her since she was always waving and giving us hearts. She was very playful with the fans. Poor girl kept fanning herself because the inside of the building was so hot (cause BLACKPINK was in the area lol). 

overall, inkigayo was tiring as hell, but worth it. It was roughly an hour long, but I don't think I would do it again because of how late it was and how sleepy I am now. looking forward to the live recording at least. 

again, thanks for reading ",23,160

2565,2017-06-25,2017,6,25,8,6jb9v4,"Out of curiousity, why do K-Pop artists do more ""hi-touch"" meet and greets versus ""autograph/photo op"" meet and greets?",SilverSquare,1498347363,"It's something that's been on my mind and what I wanted to ask for a while. I noticed with huge events like KCon that are coming up, the guests usually offer a ""hi-touch"" meet and greet where you just line up and literally say hi and hi-five them and go upon your business.

In Western Culture, you usually get to meet the celebrities in a more intimiate setting. At anime, game, and comic conventions, you usually get to do more. You spend a bit more money just to either get a photo op, a selfie, or even an autograph or two. In those autograph sessions, you usually get a minute or two to say hi and even hi five them if you're into that. Usually the people you get to meet are like B-Level stars unless the convention shells out a lot of money. (ex. You'd get to meet someone like the actor for TV Show at a con, but you won't be able to meet Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) a con since he typically doesn't do it.)

Even if we remove the convention scene in general. Many musicians typically have limited VIP tickets where you can a photo or an autograph.

I don't even think it's limited to K-Pop stars too. I think even Japanese artists/idols don't usually do that too. Whenever there IS a western style meet and greet, it's rare that I'd hear about it. Like I met Jay Park a few years ago, but he did a tour in the west and it was sponsored by some cell phone company that I forgot. I was able to get a photo, but that was it.

So is this some cultural thing? Do they only do selfies/selcas and autographs in their own country? Or do they value the value of their own autographs? I respect if they don't want to do it. But I'm just curious at the differences between how eastern and western musicians/celebrities approach meeting their fans.",10,28

Only went to the concert on Saturday, but convention was great for both days. On Friday I danced with 1million (got a pic with may), saw gfriend insanely close, and got dope shit.

Saturday I was fucking blessed. Started off by going to a fashion panel with 8mm and jre and I managed to snag a free hat, then saw more cool performances, but what topped it off was that I found someone that wanted to trade my Saturday red carpet for A TWICE HITOUCH so I did that and literally died. Videos do no justice to how amazing the 9 of them are. Like I was literally in shock with how strong the aura was around them (and how sparkly tzuyus smile is up close). After that watched more performances, ran into jre and snagged a selfie, then went to the concert. Damn was that awesome. Twice went first doing a jyp medley (lit). Then up10tion did they're shit, and tbh I never heard of them before but I gotta check them out they killed the stage. After was nct127 and fuck fire truck and cherry bomb go hard especially when you're in the pit. Everyone has mad nice jawlines wtf. Twiceeeeeee came next and murdered the shit out of me. How is it possible to be better than perfect. They only did signal, tt, cheer up, and knock knock but it was the best ever. And then cn blue  killed it with Cinderella and songs that I don't know the name but can't get out of my head. Btw yomghwa was all over the stage it was great. Overall convention = 8/10, concert 10/10

2613,2017-06-25,2017,6,25,21,6je4do,UP10TION Meet &amp; Greet at KCON NY 2017,splitsthesky,1498394354,"I know there have been some KCON posts already shared here, so this isn't going to be about the concert or even most of the con, but I managed to get this amazing opportunity so I wanted to share (and it was too long for a comment anyway, tbh).

Just to set the stage: I loved all of the artists this year at KCON NY, but I was most excited to see UP10TION, so my goal was to make this as U10T-y a day as possible. I went to the fan engagement session in the morning, but just as audience; I knew in advance I didnt want to do hi-touch, because I figured I would just stress myself out about seeing them face-to-face. So I skipped that part, but still had a great time at the fan engagement  Kevin Woo MCed, which was great because they already know him and were comfortable with him, they played a brief game of charades and Wei got too into helping Sunyoul with his cheetah impression and ripped his pants, and then had to awkwardly hold his (long, fortunately) sweater(/jacket?) around himself as they did the hi-touch, it was a good time all-around.

After that I knew they were supposed to make an appearance at the Toyota tent, so that was the next stop. Toyota had this huge claw machine game where you could win various prizes, and there was still some time to kill, so I figured why not. I was honestly not expecting anything out of it, but.ended up with a voucher for the ""UP10TION Meet &amp; Greet; so much for not seeing them face-to-face.

There were 10 of us fans (and then a crowd gathered around, outside the sectioned-off area by the stage where we were), and we did have to wait for a bit until the boys came out, but we had been told to be at the front, but crouch down, so people could see over us, which ended up with us 10 kneeling on the floor (everyone with their phones out for pictures), staring almost straight up at the boys on the stage. It was a weird angle, but also my brain was just having a hard time processing seeing them *up close* - Ive been to kpop concerts before, so Ive seen idols in real life, Id even seen *these particular ones* only a couple hours prior, but this was much closer, it  was a lot. They look just as flawless up close as they do on screen or from far away, but up close you become more conscious of that theyve been *styled* for that  like, obviously I know idols get their makeup and hair done and all, but for me at least, it was different to actually *see* it so close-up. Also, I know Kuhn is always the sweatiest of all of them, but even to actually see him sweating so much (*such* a sweaty child.&lt;3) was so hard for my mind to process, how we were right *next* to them.

We all did that game where you pick one out of two choices (you know, like, summer or winter? dog or cat?, etc) and have to match your answers. I went with Kogyeol, who leaned down to make very intense eye contact, like he was *so* sure of our mental telepathic connection and was just *trusting* me to say the right answer. Which was all well and good (though it certainly didnt help my coming to grips that this whole thing was actually happening irl), except that simultaneously I had *zero* idea of what he was going to say. Anyhow, were not mentally telepathic or compatible or whatever, ours was sweater or t-shirt? and I said t-shirt! because it was so hot and so humid out and everyone  us, them (esp. Kuhn), *everyone*, was sweating buckets; sweater was not the correct choice, whats wrong with you, Kogyeol. anyway, it worked out, because I got to sit back down and he stopped staring into my eyes, so I could pull my brain out of just, !!!!-mode and collect myself again.

After everyone had a turn (Kuhn had to go twice because there were 10 of us and only 9 of them without Wooshin), it ended up in just a game of rock, paper, scissors to determine the final winner~ (who was not me, obviously), who got to take an individual picture with the boys. After that we all got a picture with them, in groups, and because while all this picture-taking was happening they started playing UP10TION songs in the background, people in the crowd started fanchanting/singing along, which the boys were so visibly excited and happy to hear, that all these people here knew and loved their music; there were big grins all around.

After pictures they left, and all us girls had a fan-emotional-support huddle (everyone was *super* nice, by the way; I even ran into one of the girls again later after the concert, and we high-fived), and then got pulled over to the side by the Toyota booth staff for group pictures and individual interviews (mine went like this:  
Toyota Rep: So how was the experience?  
Me: surreal.  
Rep: \*laughs\* Okay, and what was your favorite part?  
Me: Seeing them, so up close.  
Rep: \*laughs more\*  
LISTEN, MY DUDE, I AM FOR REAL.).

That was it, then we were released~, Toyota took our emails earlier to send [us] stuff, which I hope means the pictures (or at least a link to them), becauseI dont have the one with me in it. Though [here are some I did take](http://imgur.com/a/4yzv9), ofvarious quality, Im going to tell you guys right now, a fansite master I am not.

Also, I know this isnt an account of the concert, but just to add, they performed their new (out on Thursday!!!) song Runner for us, and it is so, SO GOOD. *SO GOOD*. Like, obviously I love UP10TION, but even objectively, though, its *amazing*, if you havent seen a fancam of it yet or are just waiting for the official release, justbelieve me, its worth checking out.",6,55

2647,2017-06-26,2017,6,26,6,6jgtzk,"Dean (with Miso and SAAY) at the Camden Koko, Sunday 25th June",professorgenkii,1498425621,"I had the pleasure of seeing Dean at the Koko in London tonight. I'm tired so I'll try to keep this short and sweet. 

I had a General Entry ticket and doors for the VIP bunch and early entry opened at like 6 but we didn't get let in until 8ish because of the extra security checks they've implemented in London recently. The venue is about 1,400 capacity I think and it was pretty full. Both SAAY and Miso were good (I'm starting to really get into k-indie so it was nice to see Miso) and I'm going to listen to them more. 

Let me preface this next part by saying that Dean played a 50 minute set. After Zico's 40 minute set at the Koko a few months ago I wasn't too surprised, but still a little disappointed. I don't get why you'd fly all the way from Korea to perform for such a short amount of time but whatever. 

Dean's voice is like butter though. It's so smooth and so clear. Obviously everyone was there for him so every song was received well, but the guy has some serious talent (and some good genes too, damn). 

He performed the songs off TRBL and a couple of singles including I'm Not Sorry, and the encore was Bermuda Triangle. He did Zico's rap in Pour Up really well, everyone was really hyped. 21 and D(Half Moon) sounded so great. I'm happy he sang Bonnie and Clyde too because that's my favourite but he cut the final part of the outro which is my favourite part :(

Overall 8/10 would do again, kinda wish I caught the matinee show on the Saturday too because I could listen to his voice allllll day. ",5,29

2669,2017-06-26,2017,6,26,11,6jiklb,"170625 NCT #127 @ Apple Store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NYC",park-chanyeol,1498445915,"This is my first fan account and none of my pictures came out well enough to post so do forgive me.

The announcement for this event went up only a few days before KCON NY, and I was both conflicted and convinced it was a scam, as I mentioned in my comment on the last Friday Free-for-all thread. There was a button on the Apple website to RSVP, but the event was already booked by the time I heard about it. Since it was free, I figured it didn't even matter - it is a store, after all, and I could just pretend I was looking for a new phone - and decided to go. I was bitter about not being able to go to KCON this year, and figured getting a chance to see NCT 127 for free would be worth it. 

Since I was staying at my sister's place in Queens for the weekend, we had to wake up around 7:30 am to make the 10 am starting time. I checked Twitter before we left and saw people saying there were three lines. Lovely. We trekked down there anyway and made it right at 10 am, and an employee at the front just registered us for the event right there by taking our names, phone numbers, and e-mails, even though neither of us had been able to reserve. We made it in and they shut the doors behind us, and the store was only about half-filled, better than I was expecting, even though everyone was packed together. There were fansites standing on stepstools right in front of my already short self which I was a little miffed about, but the moderator for the day came out on time and played the Limitless music video to ""get warmed up."" 

After that, the boys came out wearing the camo pants/outfits from the Cherry Bomb video and performed Limitless! I was surprised by how loud the crowd was and how well we all did the fanchants. The most cheers were for Mark, Johnny, Taeil, Jaehyun, and Taeyong, though I did see two Winwin fans and two Yuta signs. A girl in front of me kept grasping her chest between taking pictures and saying ""Yuta,"" to herself, which I honestly understood. When the song finished, they did their greeting and sat down on the side of the stage for their talk with the moderator. Mark did most of the talking. The questions had to do with the varied genres on Cherry Bomb (Mark stumbled talking about the album, accidentally saying ""6 tracks on our songs... uh..."" and my sister yelled HE'S SO CUTE!), what it was like to perform at KCON and in America for the first time, what they want to do if they come back to NYC (Johnny said take his friends out to eat and go to Times Square and the Statue of Liberty, to which my sister said, ""how basic."" Leave him be...), what it was like working with Tony Testa (the moderator prompted them to show some ""moves,"" and Taeyong got up and did a few moves from Cherry Bomb), Mark and Taeyong's rap-making, and what artists they'd like to work with (I don't remember who said it, but they said as good as other artists are, they'd like to make something entirely of their own). There was a translator, which allowed Taeyong and I think Yuta to answer a few questions as well. The others kept quiet - they must have been seriously jetlagged. All through it we kept cheering, and a few people kept yelling Johnny's name and ""I LOVE YOU!"" Same.

After the interview, they went offstage for a second (I assumed to change, but their outfits stayed the same) so they could play about a minute of the Cherry Bomb video on the screen. Then they came back out and performed 0 Mile, and I almost exploded right there. For some reason I was the only person doing the fanchant, which made me feel like an idiot when I yelled NCT! NCT! at the beginning from the back by myself. Cherry Bomb came after that. Although they were lipsyncing, their dancing and performances were as strong as always, and I found myself screeching at Mark's lift and Taeyong's death drop even though I knew they were coming anyway. 

They went offstage again after Cherry Bomb, and the moderator came back on like ""That brings us to the end... Unless we can bring them back?"" and made us all chant N-C-T until they of course came back, did their greeting again, and said their goodbyes. I was hoping for individual introductions but didn't get any. All of it was over in 45 minutes or so. The store employees kept having to go into the crowd during the show and tell the fansites not to use their giant camera lenses and not to sit or stand on the store tables. 

We went out back to the exit to see if we could catch them leave, but they fooled us and went out the front. 

All of this before 11 am... Still way better than paying $400 for KCON tickets and not seeing them as close as I did today. I had a great time and I'm really glad something as admittedly weird as this went down. 

Loose ends:

* I still don't have a solid bias in all of NCT yet! Going in I considered Yuta and Haechan to be my favorites, but Johnny really had me feeling some kind of way... Maybe it's just because I like tall guys?

* Afterwards I went out to buy a copy of Cherry Bomb from Koreatown, and got a Taeyong photocard. It's a really nicely designed album!

* edit: Forgot to add that my dad texted me after the show asking how ""NC-17"" was. At least he tried.

Sorry about the general incoherence of this. AMA, I guess. I definitely left a few things out.",6,64

2711,2017-06-26,2017,6,26,17,6jjtem,[Rumor] GOT7 to go on hiatus after Bambam's enlistment into the Thai army,II_Shwin_II,1498464884,"this is all twitter rumors and circumstantial evidence so bear with me

Bambam, who has gone back to Thailand this past week, recently left a comment on his own old photo with an [emoji of a hand waving.](http://i.imgur.com/EtmoHkV.jpg), as well as updating his [twitter bio](http://i.imgur.com/hZwxlFF.png).  Many fans are speculating that he has been randomly selected to enlist in the Thai army, as their system consists of random drawing of cards, and does not take into account special status as an idol. 

This explanation would also coincide with the recent news of Jackson setting up his own studio in China and the upcoming JJP comeback, as well as Jinyoung's new drama.

EDIT: There is also the possibility of Bambam doing voluntary enlistment, which lasts for 6 months as opposed to the 2 years he would do if he was drafted. 

EDIT 2: In recent fansigns, GOT7 were reported to be getting emotional, and a translation of one of Jinyoung's comments stated: ""He said the seven boys are (going to) trust each other and run forward. He ask for us to trust them too""

2755,2017-06-27,2017,6,27,0,6jlrpl,Introducing Search and Filter by Flair,Kilenaitor,1498490789,"Hello /r/kpop! 

So, as announced at the last town hall we changed the way flairs are being done on the sub. tl;dr: no more flairs in titles; assign a flair to a post after submitting it. 

Building on that, we have implemented a few new features on the sub that take advantage of this new flair implementation that we're really excited to announce to you today. 

### Colors
As you can see, the sub got a lot more colorful. Flairs have been categorized to fit into a few main categories: 

* **News**
 * Rumors
 * Interviews
* **Releases**
 * MVs
 * Audio
* **Teasers**
* **Performances**
 * Live
 * Song Cover
 * Dance Cover
 * Dance Practice
* **Variety** 
 * Behind-The-Scenes
* **Discussions**
 * Album Discussions
 * Fan Accounts

Each major category gets its own color so now you will be able to visually distinguish posts immediately even without having to read the entire headline. 

### Searching
Along with the colors, you'll see a new section in the sidebar: `Search By Flair`. This section has a link for every flair category listed above that you can click on and see a list of submissions to the sub with that flair, sorted by new. 

So now if you just want to see all recent releases, just click the `Releases` button in the sidebar! Since we have the links in the sidebar this also means you'll be able to access it on Mobile as well as Desktop. 

### Filters
Lastly, we have implemented exclusion-filtering via the sidebar. The new section for filters is right underneath the Search by Flair and is appropriately labeled `Filter by Flair`. Now you'll be able to **filter out** certain posts from the sub. Clicking on this filter re-directs you to a new URL that is a subdomain of /r/kpop meaning those that are browsing on desktop or mobile browsers (sorry clients) will be able to bookmark these URLs. In essence, if I click `Hide Variety`, I will be re-directed to `kr-06.reddit.com/r/kpop` which is the specific URL to filter out all posts tagged with the `Variety` flair. 

Realize you actually want to see all-kinds of posts again? No worries. Just click the `Show All` button that now appears. 

### Feedback
So, those are the changes we have today. As you can see, some great new features. We'd love to hear your feedback on these changes. Let us know below if you're running into any issues, if anything is confusing, or there are features you'd like us to implement next! Looking forward to discussing this with you all. ",55,233

There are many versions of practice videos so maybe the entirety of one of those are your favorites.

For me it would be 2 moments. First is BTS's Dope practice video where Namjoon waves to the camera [at 3:20](https://youtu.be/UrNfJ7AwW_g) in between Suga and J-hope. Second is Big Bang's Bang Bang Bang practice video where Taeyang claps too early and GD laughs at him [at 0:36](https://youtu.be/uxqjsXjSKPk). I found this one funny cuz the members always say Taeyang never messes up. (Sorry on mobile so I can't time stamp.)

**EDIT:** If you want to be extra challenging, also have your predictions do the following:

* Not be a group with major rumors of disbanding (e.g., AOA).
* Not be a group that has shown long-term signs of eventual disbanding (e.g., Crayon Pop).
* Not be a relatively unknown group (e.g., HISTORY).",376,189

2771,2017-06-27,2017,6,27,6,6jo05x,"Dean [with Miso, SAAY and 2xxx] at KOKO London, 06/25/17",kwonsohyun,1498511299,"I saw there was recently another fan account on Deans latest concert in London yesterday but just wanted to throw up a couple of my own personal opinions on the show after getting back. Ill preface this by saying this ended up being my favorite concert Ive ever been to and overall, my respect for Dean as an artist has grown hugely.


While Ive listened to Deans releases when they first dropped, I never went out of my way to listen to his music too regularly. In the days before the concert, I listened to all his songs available to date to get a little more familiar with them before watching him live.  


I had a General Entry ticket, which was supposed to offer access at 6 PM when the doors opened for everyone. As mentioned by the other poster, there was a fair delay and we eventually ended up getting in just before 8 PM. With the recent attacks in London, its clear they had heightened security across the board, which I feel everyone was entirely understanding of. Well after an hour and a half after we were supposed to gain entry, pizza boxes were being passed up and down the line. Dean had apparently [ordered pizza](https://twitter.com/xonamjoon/status/878999597087174657) for everyone sat waiting in line, which was seriously the sweetest thing Ive ever seen from an artist.


When we finally got in, 2xxx had already kicked off with a set. Shortly after SAAY and Miso were on stage, ahead of Deans own set, which ran just short of an hour. Even before his set, Dean joined SAAY and Miso on stage. While artists usually hide backstage until their own set begins, Dean just came out and started dancing around (and on) the table. While SAAY and Miso are still rising artists, they had great stage presence and got everyone hyped up.


With Dean not having an extensive library of songs, a majority of the performance was based off 130 Mood: TRBL, with singles like Put My Hands On You and Im Not Sorry. We also got Bermuda Triangle at the end and Dean did an amazing job at rapping Zicos parts. Deans always had a smooth voice, but you dont realize how amazing his voice can be until you hear him live. He shook up a couple of the songs and put some nice twists on the live set. Also, [this](https://twitter.com/sugabyeol/status/879179417611714560) happened (NSFW)


Just between Deans attitude to the whole concert and his charisma, the concert overall just felt really laid back. How he just spoke to the crowd, approached his performance and threw posters across the venue, Dean did a great job at creating a really welcoming and chilled atmosphere. Maybe Dean's own set couldve been a little longer, but this has been my favorite performance Ive ever been to, by far. Miso, SAAY, and Dean all did an amazing job at getting the crowd into it and I enjoyed every second. 

 
I've been to a few K-Pop concerts in the UK now, and Dean had the best stage presence I've seen from an artist. I think his English definitely helped by letting him come out of his shell, but I feel his approach to everything seriously stood out. From someone who wasn't hugely invested beforehand, I've really got to give props for his entire performance this weekend. ",2,24

I had heard NCT 127's songs before, but prior to KCON I had considered them to be lukewarm at best. However, after seeing their live performances of 'Cherry Bomb' and 'Firetruck', I couldn't help but believe that NCT 127 was going to be real big in the future.",48,62

2969,2017-06-28,2017,6,28,19,6jzpsd,"Former JYP trainees Jiwon, Chaeyeon, Eunsuh, and Natty have joined Mnet's 'Idol School'",OH_mes,1498645890,"Idol School is Mnet's new program that takes girls who have the desire to become idols and puts them through schooling and training. Those that pass the final ""graduation test"" will be able to take part in the new girl group.

Originally there was a report that students were not allowed to be signed with any agency. Because of this, I assumed the 4 former JYP trainees already left. But apparently there is a member of Bonus Baby (rookie idol group) on the show??

It seems like trainees under contract might still be allowed to join the show afterall?

Idol School statement ended up saying that while they haven't created an exlcusive contract yet, they will soon because there are students who do not have agencies (because they are non-celebrities) and are minors. The program requires 5-6 months of training and other stuff that needs constant care and monitoring of the students. They mention that they will not be involved with management after this training period.

Those who graduate and debut with the new group will be under different management. Mnet does not know which agency they will debut under. 

Those who fail to graduate will have help and support in their further activities, which will be explained more in depth at the end of the program. Students who fail to graduate are also allowed to terminate their contracts.

My personal boy group fave is SEVENTEEN 'Boom Boom.' I'm totally biased because they're my bias group but that MV has the best fashion from all of theirs IMO.  All of the members have their own aesthetic and they all look so good  [Here's](https://youtu.be/IzplmS-VeBc?t=23) a scene where you can kind of see everyone. Favorite outfit in the MV is probably [Minghao's](http://pm1.narvii.com/6302/a1331362688bc6861342885bf25a32f191b2f577_hq.jpg).

For a girl group, I actually really loved Twice 'Like Ooh Ahh' outfits!  Not the roleplay kind of character ones, but the coordinating ones with the [red and camo.](https://youtu.be/0rtV5esQT6I?t=114) Personal faves are Tzuyu (her top is to die for) and Momo (esp with that High Ponytail).

Solo MV: I ADORE everything about IU 'Palette'! All of the outfits have really different aesthetics but they suit her so well. Favorite has to be [this one](https://youtu.be/d9IxdwEFk1c?t=98)! It's really different from what she's done before and her hair is so cute when it's messy.

3014,2017-06-29,2017,6,29,8,6k4nga,Some ideas on how to promote KPOP in Western countries,JJDude,1498694227,"I've been thinking about how a really popular KPOP group can crack the ""gen pop"" Western market, and I wanted to post some ideas.  I think one of the biggest issue KPOP or any Asian act face is the extremely negative racist stereotype of Asians which exists in Western entertainment industries. Notice not that Western audience are racist in general, but the pop media industry sure is.  So in order to really reach an audience, I think collaboration with any Western music/media company must be avoided as much as possible.  So I think if a already successful KPOP group with music which is appealing to Western tastes, like BTS or BlackPink, there are still ways to do this.
 
A few ideas:

 * Do not annonce ""Western advancement"".  Don't treat it as a thing
 * Do not move anyone or even travel to the West for ""Advancement"" (like the Wonder Girls).  Do traditional comebacks in Korea or any other Asian country. Visit the West as needed as part of your comeback in later stages.

 * Make sure one of two of your members is fluent in English
 * For every Korean comeback, release an English version of the song and MV
 * DO promote the English version online only;  via Western SMS and youtube/spotify promotion as they would Western artists
 * Discount the English version on iTunes so it's slightly cheaper
 * Encourage grassroot foreign fans activities such as youtube views count races. Actively promote it if they did something exciting
 * Offer special attention to foreign fans who started to use the nicknames like ARMY or BLINKS. Interact with them as much as possible through online means using English or other Western language.  Have them sign up for actual membership and send them free swags.
 * Organize free events in western countries like mini-concerts or meet-and-greets for variety of locations with larger fanbase.  Make sure it's big enough so that the press can't ignore it
 * Never lose identity as KPOP performer. Always mix English songs with Korean/Japanese version of the songs
 * Organize a few larger ticketed concert in strategic cities.  Ask the loyal fans in the local area to help with promotion online via SMS
 * Send your artists to do interviews for traditional Western media if they are interested. Play it cool.

Basically what I stress here is that never use traditional Western media company for any promotion. Work directly with foreign fans who found KPOP via the internet to help with promotion. Never give Western media ways to belittle or make fun of you. Use the internet as much as possible, and reward loyal foreign fans with special meetings or gifts.  Do not treat ""Western advancement"" as a thing like Japanese advancement.  Just make your music or promotional materials accessible to Western fans or even casual listeners.   When the popularity is strong enough, just have concerts that feel welcoming to non-KPOP audience with English language songs and members who speaks English or other Western language fluently.   

These are just some ideas which I'm sure some people might disagree with.  Just want to have some discussion going as I'm keenly interested in this topic.  Honestly I am starting to see a few acts like BTS starting to move in this direction, which I'm pretty excited about.  I hope to see KPOP artists grew in popularity w/o having to be more ""Western"" as if there's something wrong with being a Korean or Asian artist.  ",27,0

This is a bit different than the earlier post, they actually released a statement about it. The first one ended up with FNC saying they're still in the process of discussing her leave.

FNC Statement:

We would like to inform everyone about Choa's withdrawal from AOA. The company respects Choa's opinion and it has been decided that she will leave the group.

The remaining members of AOA will be meeting their fans through individual activities in various fields. Thank you for your love and support.",19,224

**If possible please comment or link the time stamps!**

*Details I always look forward hearing in songs:*

* **Red Velvet** - Talk To Me:
[*the very quick ""yeah"" part after ""na na na na na na""*](https://youtu.be/fbV7AQxux98?t=46s)  **EDIT:** [forgot to add how this spoken word cadence just sounds so cool ](https://youtu.be/fbV7AQxux98?t=2m37s)

* **Wonder Girls** - Loved:
[*the faded guitar in the mix*]( https://youtu.be/DyTNrbk3Pg0?t=33s)

* **F(x)** - Shadow:
[*the quirky yet creepy vocal samples lurking behind the melody*]( https://youtu.be/LY25vVPCKr8?t=6s)

* **BTS** - Two! Three!:
[*background vocals behind Suga's rap*](https://youtu.be/oPAHklE8Tsc?t=56s)

* **Shinee** - Clue + Note:
[*subtle gritty bassline jamming on Jonghyun's part*]( https://youtu.be/8kyG5tTZ1iE?t=1m15s)

***EDIT: Format edits and thought of more that I haven't seen on this thread yet!***

* **BIGBANG** - FXXX IT:
[*the most lit beat claps I've ever heard in a k-pop song*]( https://youtu.be/iIPH8LFYFRk?t=1m6s)

* **MAMAMOO** - woo hoo:
[*this vocal harmony is so precious...*](https://youtu.be/_eCJOj4NLlg?t=18s)

* **TWICE** - SIGNAL:
[*this heavily processed ""jirit"" sounds really aesthetically pleasing to me, reminds me of Pokemon for some reason*](https://youtu.be/VQtonf1fv_s?t=2m)

* **Zion. T** - Doop:
