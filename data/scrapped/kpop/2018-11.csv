12,2018-11-01,2018,11,1,10,9t5bjb,What happened to rapper Yuk Jidam?,yawningdon,1541037218,"It seems like she completely vanished off the face of the planet after the whole Kang Daniel controversy and the most recent info I can find is from Jan-Feb 2018 which is almost a whole year ago... I really liked her and I just want to know if she's okay.

This is all the info i've gathered thus far:

\&gt; she signed with a label and the label kept putting off her songs; their excuse being that she has to wait and be patient for her turn

\&gt; rapper Heize joined the label and she was getting songs right off the get go so immediately Jidam was worried

\&gt; she contacted her label once again getting nothing

\&gt; Mnet believed in her potential and decided to give her another chance by giving her a role in Unpretty Rapstar 3 to refresh her fan's minds of her existence

\&gt; she talked to Heize about her situation and apparently she was having the same issues with no songs and such

\&gt; she tried many times to quit her label

\&gt; in the end her dad dragged her out of the company and they ran away to a small town

\&gt; she works in her father's bakery

&amp;#x200B;

I know that may seem like the whole story right there, but there has to be more. I don't even remember where I read that. What happened to her label when they figured out she ran away? Why did she delete her Instagram like that? Will she come back to music? I have so many questions...",2,1

Today, I was checking out the pictures for the new gugudan comeback, and the first thing I thought when I saw Mimi was what the hell happened to her hair. Those microbangs or any bangs that don't go over eyebrows don't look good on very many people, and especially not the way they cut them for her. It's like when Irene had microbangs in the Red Flavor MV and I was so happy they weren't a permanent thing. I feel like almost every female idol has to go through a bang phase, and about half the time the style of bangs just isn't very good. Yuqi's in Hann were very...interesting, to say the least.

Also very much not a fan of those dresses/skirts where the actual skirt is short but there's a long sheer layer over it (look at Hwasa's black outfit in Decalcomanie and Taeyeon's in Lil Touch for reference).

It also kind of bothers me when everyone in the group wears the exact same outfit. I get it's to show like uniformity and cohesiveness and all that, but I think there's plenty of ways you can style outfits to coordinate without being the exact same. Sistar's stylists were really good at this, and I also like how the all black outfits in Pristin V's Get It go together. Especially when everyone's dressed as a school girl or school boy...something about that I just don't like and I can't explain why...

Wait also, is it just me or does like every idol own that one Gucci shirt? Not even surprised when I see it anymore lol. ~~Is it like the cheapest thing from Gucci or something and that's why everyone has it?~~",127,1

To be honest, I dont know any male kpop fans irl which led me to be more distant towards my guy friends and have recently gotten closer with girls. 

The guys dont really make fun of me (i think its because i act kind of tough) but they do talk shit about it when girls talk about it. And when there ARE times that i tell them my interest in kpop, they always answer with an awkward i never thought YOU would like kpop as if they expect male kpop fans to be a certain type.

I know that a lot of guys dont judge and are nice about it but from my experience, having mostly guy friends most of my life, i can say its a majority. Honestly, im not afraid to say that in general, girls are a lot more open-minded than guys and have less radical opinions about gender or lgbtq matters(Im completely straight btw(but kpop idols make me wanna be their bitch)).What do you guys think about this?",0,1

While for IZ*Ones - La Vie En Rose which I do think is a very solid song overall especially for a debut. Though I do prefer the verses (during Eunbi and Chaeyeon parts) they just exude so much strength. Time stamps would be 0.45 and 1:54

The only exception was this one thread where someone who genuinely studied East Asia (I think they said they studied it, Im assuming in college) and shut down someone who was being ignorant, but some other threads are still ridiculous.

YG artists can easily go to the top of the digital charts but their physical sales (100K+ every release) are always struggling. iKON didn't got nominated in this year's MAMA Best Male Group award (or the Album of the Year award) because of ""lack in physicals"".

Opposite from YG, SM artists are monsters in album sales (200K+ every release) but pretty mediocre at the digital charts. Best example for this is EXO, they just released their new album yesterday but already struggling for getting AK/CAK/PAK or topping the charts or whatnot.

~~Both agencies' artists are doing great, this is just my observation.~~

256,2018-11-03,2018,11,3,22,9tu330,Crush - Wonderland Tour in Seoul 181103,geegeebb,1541251835,"I just came back from the first show of Crush's Wonderland tour in Seoul, so I thought I'd type a quick fan account like I did for his last tour :)

This venue was bigger than his last one: about 3,000 seats in total. I was in the right-side standing section. There was an extended stage all the way to the 1st floor sections.

Before the show there was a thumping sound filling the venue, like a heartbeat. At 6PM the thump grew louder and louder until the music finally started.

He sang a couple of songs from Crush on You and his hit song Beautiful. Quite an eye-catching start. The stage lights and background were simple and colourful, it was like looking at minimalist art. His face was mostly hidden by the stage effects, so all we could see was his and the band's silhouette.

Next there were two calmer segments, one with a VCR of New York with a jazzy tune and one with Crush narrating about lost times, the beauty of vintage/analogue things, and how music helped him get through tough times. He sounded pretty serious, but everyone laughed at the narration... He came out on stage and said, ""Why'd you laugh??"" The music in these segments was mostly slow and ballady. One song featured a beautiful effect that made it look the like the stage was filling up with water. It was amazing.

Then it was guest stage time. He first brought over two guests for a joint stage (I didn't recognise them, sorry). They seemed awfully polite to each other? Their talk kind of broke the flow of the concert, but it was a good song. Then Crush performed Chill with Sik-K, who after that had the stage for himself for another song. The guest features weren't bad at all: I still had loads of fun, but considering last time we got a whole hype segment of collabs and famous solo stages from Dean, Zico and Penomeco, this year's felt slightly downgraded (I was lowkey hoping he would get Colde to appear with him).

After that it was back to smooth Crush with Give it to Me, A Little Bit, and more sexy stuff. Every stage in this segment was absolutely delightful. Slowly the concert was coming to an end, but Crush saved his energy for last with a party segment featuring Hug Me and Outside (the dancing human puppies in the background video were a nice touch). He had FUN with those songs, everybody was jumping.

After Crush left the stage, shouts for encore went on for less than a minute before the thumping sound was back again. He returned for a performance of 2411, then he reminded us of the meaning behind his tour concept: bringing back the time that was lost/forgotten. Fittingly, he ended the encore with , and he almost made it through without crying! He choked a little but quickly recomposed himself.

He exited the stage while taking his time to wave to everyone and say goodbye. The last VCR was of him recording the cringy narration from before, then his voice singing an acoustic song in English which I also don't recognise...

Other songs he performed during the show: I Fancy You, Oasis (he did Zico's parts too!), , , Sofa, Woo Ah, Skip, Summer Love,   , Cereal (he did Zico's parts here too), .

Some photos of the venue: https://twitter.com/_yeoyou/status/1058606486123757573?s=19

In general, I was very pleased with how this tour was made. I knew from the previous tour that Crush was GOOD, and this time not only was the music amazing, the artsy stage backgrounds and lights really added to the concept of the show and the flow of it (starting off simple and mysterious, then becoming more complex and open).

He also seems to have a very good relationship with his band, who by the way were incredible and super chill (although he did make the saxophone player cry at some point by mentioning his soon-to-be-born daughter).

Now I'm glad I bought a ticket for tomorrow's show as well, so I'm looking forward to that! I'm going to be seated this time, but I'm sure it'll be just as good ",3,1

My personal pick is Taeyongs baby I dont want nobody but you from NCTs Limitless. Its a line that could 100% fall flat and put a damper on the whole song if done wrong but his delivery of it makes it fit so perfectly at the end of such a melodic chorus. He just puts so much energy and personality into it that it makes it a seamless bridge into the chanting of the post chorus which could have been jarring. Limitless just works so well and that small line has a lot to do with it imo

That being said, sometimes the choreography can increase the hype of the song or even kill it. I would like to know which songs you think the choreography killed the song and on the other hand, which choreography has improved the music a lot.  


For me the choreography of We Go Up kills the music and it's too messy. I really like it at some points, but in others I just hate it.  
On the other hand, I believe that the choreography of My First and Last only improved what was already good and took the whole set to another level.

I was at Stanford mall in Palo Alto, CA (I live in the Bay Area) shopping with my mom and I was just standing in line to buy clothes, when a really good looking guy stares right at me, sort of like he was surprised to see me. At the moment, Im just like wow, a really hot guy just met my eyes, probably the only time thatll ever happen when ALL OF A SUDDEN I realize that this guy looks really familiar!! So he stands in life DIRECTLY behind me with another lady, and Im like ok, just a really lucky lady with a really handsome husband who just happens to look like Siwon of super junior, when he suddenly starts speaking Korean!! (Note I'm also Korean) And Im noticing that he's not speaking ""banmal,"" but instead, he's speaking formally to the woman! and at that second I'm freaking out and dying on the inside and wanting to turn my head around to see if it's really him!! Then my mom came to join me in line and I'm mouthing out to her ""AN IDOL IS LITERALLY BEHIND ME IT'S SIWON OF SUPER JUNIOR"" and she mouths back ""TVXQ Changmin""? (lmao) and I mouth back ""NO IT'S CHOI SIWON"" and then she suddenly realizes too (she also watched Siwon's drama ""She was Pretty"" lol) and we literally get to the cashier and I take a glance back and then Siwon called out ""hyung"" to another man (99% sure it was his manager)! And then I just ran the hell out of there because I didn't want him to think I was creepy or a sasaeng or something!

Anyway it was such a surreal experience!! AND HE LOOKED RIGHT AT ME!!! I felt like he was trying to discern if I was Korean and if I knew who he was because I look pretty Korean (lol) but it really didn't help that my mom called out to me loudly in Korean while I was standing in line before she found out and i'm pretty sure he could then tell that we were korean lmao. BUT ANYWAYS HE WAS SO HANDSOME!! I couldn't believe it was him at first it was so surreal but he was so tall and I'm so honored and ugh I think I just died and went to heaven lol. I didn't try to talk to him or ask if it was really him because I wasn't sure and his manager kinda looked scary (lol) and also I didn't want to be weird but I searched him and found that he was actually at Stanford University yesterday for a KPOP conference so IT WAS HIM!!! But yeah I think that's the closest I'll ever get to a Kpop idol but damnnnn!

me and my best friends have to make a cafe. so
it was my task to make a music playlist. 

we decided we did want the music to be korean since it is supposed to be a korean cafe but not we do not want any kind of mainstream songs like bts, exo, blackpink, svt etc.

so i made a playlist with some chill, cool, r&amp;b songs 
i am just not sure if at this point its chill or depressing

* Project groups: I'd like to argue this generation starts the exact moment IOI debuted. Why? They set the norm of survival shows and temporary project groups we've seen repeated with great success over the past few years. Think about it: IOI, JBJ, Wanna One, IZONE, UNB, UNI.T... Even TWICE and Stray Kids, while permanent groups, had their own survival shows. And with Under19, Produce 101 S4 and that new show YG has in the works, we're gonna keep seeing this trend for a while.

* Western recognition and collabs: What makes BTS winning Top Social Artist at the BBMAs two years in a row different from PSY's international recognition with Gangnam Style? I think it's just how the US audience reacted to both releases. While Gangnam Style still remains the only K-Pop song to get to the top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, the only non-western MV to get 2B+ views on Youtube ever and allowing PSY to collab with people the size of Snoop Dogg, the song still fit in neatly into (and arguably cemented) many of the harmful stereotypes lots of people already had about the genre: funny dance, ridiculous video, who cares about anything when Those Crazy Asians^(TM) are at it again? Contrast that to BTS, who beat a ton of worldwide-renowned artists and fandoms by well over 250 MILLION votes, and whose most famous videos don't fulfill those ideas, or if they do, it's to a partial extent. Basically, the industry was forced to look at the genre more seriously. And it shows. That was the catalyst to a new world of possibilities for K-pop and Western collabs: BTS and Steve Aoki, SuJu and Leslie Grace/Reik, BLACKPINK and Dua Lipa, and now Madison Beer and (G)I-DLE. That's what Hangover and Dirty Vibe lacked that Kiss And Make Up and Waste It On Me don't.

Im heading to Seoul on Exchange next semester. While Im there, I of course want to go to as many kpop-related events as possible. Ive been listening to/ a fan of kpop since 2013, so literally 6 years has boiled down to this. Ive heard in passing that album sales are what gets you into fansigns/fanmeets, but do any of you have advice on HOW to know of these events, and any insider information on getting in? 

PS- Im aware fancafes are very important. My korean is okay, no where near fluent though. Is there anywhere else besides the fancafes events might be posted?

Anyways, so recently my mother and her family members (Asians) have been NAGGING at me to audition for some JYP and/or BigHit thing (not sure what that is, from what I read, they are both record labels? BigHit being Korean and JYP being more Asian in general.) I even seen a facebook post from one of the family members, showing one of my dance videos that I didn't consent to being uploaded with some korean stickers as the comments, telling me to send an email to one of the korean entertainment companies (I think it was taken down though, I'm not even on facebook so I wouldn't know.)

I'm not really sure why they want me to do it, I do dance a lot and I have been practicing some rap too aswell as studying Japanese as an extra subject for my country's state exams (Not to say that K-pop is only dancing, rapping and speaking asian languages though.)

I did some research and that stuff looks extremely difficult. I told them that it's simply not for me, the contracts are really harsh, I'd have to learn korean and that I'd have to spend so much of my time training. None of them are listening to me. I keep telling them ""no"". After about a month, I have re-considered. Is this really a good idea? Thanks.",10,1

There were some good songs in 2016, but then the genre got so overdone in 2017 AND IT'S STILL HERE NOW! When I heard the teaser to SHINee's I Want You I was so done, but luckily I ended up really liking the song in the end. It's just that, for every good tropical house song, there's about five really generic ones. Kill the trend now, please.

Also trap. Winner's Everyday and NCT 127's Regular are songs I do like because I think the groups managed to pull it off, but I hated both songs at first because I dislike trap music. It's even worse when the singers' voices are autotuned to hell and back (see: Everyday and also Super Junior D&amp;E's Bout You).

And real talk: what happened to having an actual chorus? What's with all these drops and instrumental breakdowns? Songs like iKon's Killing Me, HA:TFELT's Ain't Nobody, and Sunmi's Heroine are great, but then they have some weird instrumental stuff right after or instead of a chorus. And I know 2NE1'S Come Back Home and Big Bang's Bang Bang Bang are well-loved, but I think they could have been better with real choruses. 

Speaking of choruses, when did they become so mellow? I miss those big choruses with everyone singing together instead of just the main vocalist. Infinite have some of the best choruses I've ever heard, and I was disappointed by Tell Me because the chorus just didn't live up to their other title tracks.",101,1

369,2018-11-05,2018,11,5,9,9u8z7i,What sets K-Pop apart from Western Pop musically?,Viridioz,1541379420,"I've noticed that ever since I got into K-Pop I've personally found American Pop to be more ""boring"". I've pinpointed one of the reasons for this to be melody changes: K-Pop seems to have more changing melodies and genre-mixing in one single song compared to Western Pop. This doesn't necessarily mean that K-Pop is better, but more variation in a song is definitely a personal preference that I have acquired since I began listening. I've also noticed that harmonies and ad-libs are musical choices that I'm very fond of, and that I tend to find more of in K-Pop. These are some musical choices that explains my preferences.

However, since I'm no expert in music theory and such, there might be other factors musically that makes me favour K-Pop that I don't know of. Thus the question is, what in your opinion sets K-Pop apart from their western counterpart musically? ",43,1

here are the rules for this very fake scenario:
1. you can only listen to music by artists from your chosen company (ofc).
2. if an artist was formerly with your company and then left, you can only listen to music they released while they were under that company. (i.e., no Highlight for you if you choose Cube, but you can have all the Beast you want.)
3. both active and inactive groups at the company are fair game.
4. international releases still count as long as the artist was still with the company you chose.


i think my own answer to this question currently would be **FNC**. quite a few of my favorite groups are under FNC (love me some bands), so i'd have the vast discographies of FT Island and CNBLUE at my disposal, including all of the members' solo releases, plus N.Flying, whom i love, and SF9 and AOA to fulfill my non-band idol group needs. my answer could honestly change with my mood (YG? SM? Cube? all tempting choices for different reasons), but i'm sticking to it for now!

I found out about Day 6 and exo a few weeks ago and recently listening to TWICE and Red Velvet, and TODAY I found FT Island! They are so amazing! I know the lead vocalist (Lee Hong ki) from a k-drama called You're beautiful and immediatly started listening when I knew he was in a group :D. In conclusion I made this post to just express my happiness about kpop and all the amazing groups (and the fact that I know have one more incommon interest with my crush)!!

With this comes the inescapable fandom aspect, which often brings out the worst in people when the idea of competition comes into play. A lot of fanwars and misunderstood complaints from fans about everything from how a company handles scandals to issues with military enlistment lead to a perpetuation of the idea of toxic fandom in the minds of both non Kpop fans and other Kpop fans alike.

For me: Infinite. I started watching Dancing High and then got really intrigued by Hoya/Team Hoya (watch their The Greatest Showman performance if you havent already!) because of how great of a coach he was. Come to find out about Infinite in the process. I had never bothered to listen to any of their songs despite them being pretty popular. Was jamming out to Bad for a good 20 minutes today lol.

Also BTS. Honestly never got into them despite finding I Need U so addictive (also only discovered that song because of Seulgi on Weekly Idol).  I tuned into the AMAs to see them perform purely because I was proud of them as a K-pop fan in general and now I really get it. Their stage presence alone is so impressive and paired with a song like DNA, whew! 

Ive been into K-Pop since about 2011 and here I am still discovering groups now that debuted around that time. Anyone else?

Yes, I was one of those Gangnam Style folks back in 2012. Through him, I discovered all the girls featured in his music videos (HyuNa, Ga-In and CL) and the groups associated with. I was very sporadic with my exposure to the genre until Tiny-G, which was also 2012. They were the only group I really followed, which ended up being super sad as they only lasted three years and only had three songs as an entire group. After they disbanded, I literally dipped out of the genre entirely until this year. Ironically, I can't remember what specifically drew me back into it, but I feel like I'm here to stay this time. I've been exploring much more and have found both current (and older non-active) groups that I really like and follow on a regular basis now.

567,2018-11-06,2018,11,6,17,9umm3l,What's going on with Blackpink? We have to discuss how YG treats its artists/fans once and for all.,cakeorpieorwaffles,1541492421,"YG's management has been grumbled about for a while now, but I couldn't find a proper thread where the management style and how abusive it is toward the artists/fans is discussed. I really think something is severely broken at YG and Blackpink's album scrap and Jennie's solo is pretty much a canary in a bird cage.  

To start, I'm a Blackpink fan and particularly a Jennie stan, but I listen to all of YG family's artists. I've been a YG stan for most of my life, starting from Epik High. But i'm pretty much ready to walk away for good, which is pretty surprising to myself. The little things that have happened for the last two years have left me bored, irritated, and frankly disturbed at how horribly YG treats its fans/artists.

YG is mismanaging Blackpink to the ground. I literally was only tided over from two years of eight songs because YG promised the first album of two years in November, with a full comeback schedule and multiple singles/music videos. That's literally asking for the bare minimum from fans. Even Western musicians are having more comebacks and they're notorious for the 2 year album cycle. The Dua Lipa song should have been their huge break into the west, but it only did kind of ok. I wasn't interested in that Dua Lipa song, which should've been the song that broke BP mainstream, because it sounded rushed with no video. Hell G-IDLE is getting huge opportunities like working with League of Legends and the extremely problematic but known (i guess) Madison Beer, which had a video that went to the front page of Reddit with 30k+ upvotes. What has BP been doing besides staying in the dungeon? 

Additionally, I don't think Jennie deserves this solo. Like, at all. In fact I think this announcement has set her career back a bit. If you look at the lukewarm comments pretty much everywhere, it's clear that everyone collectively seems nervous or annoyed or as done as I am. YG has made a huge mistake by pushing Jennie to the limit. She's been cast in way too much, the face of almost everything, and its too much, too fast, without having the music to back it up, or the proven star potential to be a lasting person in entertainment. I think this will make the akgae divide in BP worse. Solos in kpop are supposed to be hardwon treats for the artist after a successful career is firmly established, like Taeyeon, CL, Sica, Hyuna, etc etc etc. I've never in my life seen an artist get a solo before the first album has come out. I have to wonder if she can even carry the whole song by herself because she's always out of breath, forgetting lyrics, low energy on stage with a pissed off expression, and it really feels like YG is yet again pushing his favorite whether or not she can carry the whole song.

TL;DR: Blackpink was supposed to be given a full comeback, was shoved aside for Jennie for a solo we did not ask for nor do I think she can fully carry. And YG treats BP's other members/fans like shit. 

There is clearly a disconnect between what YG feels like doing and what fans want, and at this point this disconnect is enough for me to walk away. The artist is the one that loses in the end, because my feelings for the artists are coloured by the management's atrocious handling of the brand.

It is a bit cruel when fans call Gugudan ""Se-jeong and Friends"" but at the same time it is understandable because Se-Jeong is not just the most talented when it comes to vocals but she was already famous as she was a member of the beloved girl band, I.O.I., so she came into Gugudan with baggage. Mina is also a great singer and she's already gaining some recognition but it will take time. And every girl or boy band has its star. I mean, Nuest X has Ren, Sistar had Hyolyn, Gfriend has SinB...etc.

There are very few bands where all members are equally famous like Mamamoo but that's because all of those girls were on a equal level: Wheein, Solar and Hwasa are phenomenal vocalists whereas Moonbyul is the rapper. ",105,1

For example probably not many people know last year Woo Won Jae digital sales &gt; Wanna One. 

Also today I see some Donghan and Stay Kids stan fighting over who has more digital sales when their digital sales is miniscule compared to Haon another Rookie this year.

Yes I know Donghan is a soloist but he's from Produce and JBJ he's essentially still an Idol. JBJ also has impressive sales who knows they may get rookie award if they were not disbanded yet, their debut date last year is ambiguous, so some award show may still consider them as rookie.

Award show is always become fandom fest and even some shameless award show take advantage of that and make the fandom pay to vote.

I just hope those non idol rookie can get some reward and acknowledgement for their achievement. They deserve it. ",13,1

Here are a few that come to mind for me! Anyway, if you guys have more anime-inspiration or idols who've dressed as anime characters, I would love to see!\~ \^\_\^

**Actually dressed as Anime characters:**

* SHINee Jonghyun - [Inuyasha](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CSfJeteVAAAAqZT.jpg)
* SHINee Key - [Dragon Ball Z](https://pm1.narvii.com/6265/47f83036f4fc788c809e18798cfc3e833b2b8a77_hq.jpg)

* A.C.E Members - [Card Capture Sakura](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DpqBUaHWkAYOQh9.jpg:large)

**Reminds me of Anime characters:**

* BTS [V](https://twitter.com/rosnyvee/status/681894211940057092) looks so much like Kaneki Ken from Tokyo Ghoul! 
* SHINee [Onew](https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20131121/10/yourname-2012-08/c9/5f/j/o0480048012756047554.jpg?caw=800) in this music video. Looks very Naruto inspired haha
* A.C.E [Chan](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrURMTaU4AATANj.jpg) seems very nerd-anime like!
* A.C.E [Members](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjmhT77U4AE7bNS.jpg) here remind me of [Shoujo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjGxQxVUYAEOHXb.jpg) characters like Ouran Host Club!",6,1

Is there any way I could find out how to attend some sort of event where they might be at during the dates I'm going? Even if they are just doing 1-2 songs I wouldn't mind. 

I always see on Instagram of new, random performances from them but I never know where it's from. 

Also is Blackpink House open for us to visit still?

Any other recommendations on what I can do in Korea for tourist attractions would be much appreciated! I would like to visit some bars, clubs, AYCE Korean BBQ places, and possibly see other kpop groups like Momoland, Red Velvet, Pristin, (G)I-DLE, Mamamoo, IZ\*ONE, etc.",1,1

It's a trend in world music these nonexistent chorus and since 2015 that has become a trend in K-Pop too. I don't dislike this trend, but in that exact moment I find myself quite sick of this and I have always enjoyed very well-made chorus. So I wanted to know what choruses saved your life and made the whole song worth it. And whoever wants could recommend songs with non-existent choruses or that follow this current trend and that are good too.

Going alone doesnt help it either but I was wondering if anyone in a similar situation to myself has went to a Kpop concert and could tell me about their experiences.

Ive never been to a concert before but I really like Kpop. Going to a concert isnt what bothers me but the fact Ill very likely stand out a lot being a 6ft 3inches White guy going to a Blackpink concert most likely in Hong Kong and am worried about speaking to others there.

Thank you

707,2018-11-07,2018,11,7,13,9uw4l0,What are some seemingly small things that keep you from getting into certain groups/idols?,caralyn7,1541564578,"Are there any groups whose music you've enjoyed and you think you could become a big fan of them, but for some reason there's that one thing that makes you hesitate?

This is very weird and probably specific to just me, but if a group has more than twelve members, I just can't learn their names. EXO? Easy. LOONA? Give me twenty minutes to learn. I love WJSN and Seventeen (in my opinion SVT deserved AOTY last year) for their music, but there's something about having thirteen members that I can't do. I know about half of both groups, but hell if I remember the others' names. Admittedly I know all eighteen NCT members lol but that's only because they perform in smaller groups.

When it comes to Blackpink, I think their music is fine and pretty fun actually, but I don't listen to them for one reason: I do not like any of their voices, especially not Ros's. **This is not an attack on their singing/rapping skills, but merely my own preference**. I simply do not like the sound of their voices, yet I acknowledge that plenty of other people do. And I've come to realize that if you don't like someone's voice, it can be very hard to listen to them. I've met tons of people whose speaking voices I've found weird or annoying in some way, and I think it really does affect how I saw them. It's also hard to really get into Blackpink because, at least for me, I follow so many different artists that if one group takes a long hiatus, I forget about them in some way. And with YG's management? Yikes. I do congratulate BP for all their success though, despite the fact that they deserve to have way more music out than the, what, nine songs the have?

Gfriend have some great songs (~~bring back the days when groups could do happy and bright concepts without getting criticized for not being ""deep"" enough)~~ but other than Yuju, I don't know anything about the others. The biggest--and weirdest--reason is because they debuted with this school girl concept, and something about performing in school girl/boy outfits weirds me out. There's literally no explanation for it lol, so it's definitely just a me thing.

And finally, despite him being my Infinite bias, I cannot get into Woohyun's solo songs. Interestingly, Sungkyu is one of my favorite male soloists. This comes down to the fact that although they are both technically ballad singers, Sungkyu has more interesting, rock-blended ballads while Woohyun's are more of your traditional ones. Nothing wrong with that of course, but the problem is that Woohyun's title tracks seem too...generic for me. Idk. I still love him though.",123,1

I just felt quite worried about how people viewed Kpop (even though it is really none of my business at all), since it kind of affects my enjoyment of it...

This kind of came about as I was browsing through certain kpop content and came across a post of a Vlive on another reddit (I won't name) with just some people complaining about how Kpop is not real and authentic. And how idols only act cute on camera but are totally different when not on screen. 

This seems to be a rant. But can I ask how do people feel towards Kpop? Maybe how has it affected your life? 

I try to think that everything is not as black and white and there are many grey area. The idols, while they do act cute, are also genuine and hardworking in their activities. 

I hope no one gets annoyed by this kind of post and I was wondering if anyone could share some recent positivity related to Kpop (since this has kinda been talked about in the past).

764,2018-11-07,2018,11,7,23,9v00n4,Why Kpop resonates so well with me and many others,IamFanboy,1541602037,"First time posting in this sub but long time Sone and recently I been thinking alot about why Kpop idols just appeals to me so much more than other western stars. I'm not going to be talking about the music since its based on your own opinion but rather on other things.

Kpop idols simply feel more relatable than any other western singers, being a Kpop idol is more than just singing, to me its about bringing joy and happiness to your fans which is a 2 way street, it involves many other events such as variety shows, fan meetings and handshake events. Variety shows in particular are a great way for new fans to get to know the idols better and watching them do funny stuff or goofy stuff just makes me happy as a fan and even happier to know that my idol is recognises us fans and values us which I feel is something lacking in western music culture. [This video here](https://youtu.be/1SWuyUMNoRQ?t=493) sums it up pretty well

Other things like insta-live is a great way for them to communicate with fans apart from fan meetings and concerts. Furthermore, they encourage the formation of fan groups who come up with cheers for every individual and also cheers for the songs. You don't need to be there in person to learn these and feel ""included"", simply watching videos on youtube brings you closer to them than any western star. 

When you look at any western star, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Arianna Grande, any of the other DJs. None of them have the same level of fan interaction as Kpop stars, sure you might like their music but you can't really feel invested as a fan when they don't communicate with their fans as much or when you barely see them at all especially for foreign fans. 

Even when you go to Western singer concerts, you will have fans singing their songs and thats it. I had the privilege of going to a SNSD concert where apart from singing their songs, the whole crowd was going 

  (Jigeumeun SNSD = Now girls' generation)

  (Appurodo SNSD = In the future girls' generation)

  (Yeongwonhi SNSD = Forever girls' generation)

  (SNSD saranghae)

and just screaming that together brings about a bond with so many others that you have never felt before

Out of shock, I called out his name and he turned around and said Hey (or at least from what my friend recalls, I was too shook). 

He seemed like he was in a rush to get somewhere? So we didnt ask for a picture or anything. I stopped my friend from following him too, just to respect his space. 

And no, I didnt see any other DAY6 members today.. But honestly, meeting him today made me realize that Im finally getting to meet all of DAY6 again in 2 days!

For example I really loved the creativity in the Boys24 stages (not that anybody watched the show lol). Their version of [GFriend - Rough](https://youtu.be/CiQAbQHcZUU) with the traditional instrumental that cuts in at the end and the fans in their hand was totally unexpected but it's also a really cool idea.

Also I thought the performance aspect in [The Unit Red's Beyonce](https://youtu.be/O86w3PaXQQQ) stage was really well done (and not just because it's hella gay lol).

The band version of [Blackpink - Fire](https://youtu.be/2oj6LPCtCYI) from Broduce was also an unexpected but welcome surprise. It's so out of place in the entire Produce series but I love coming back to it.

The stage though that still gives the most chills even almost three years later is [OT20 Produce 101 - Crush](https://youtu.be/OqOhEn3dftI) because this is the first time I realized that this might possibly work out and be an actually really good group.
I remember watching the finale live with my minimal understanding of Korean and when they started to perform this song I thought yeah, these people are going hard for their last chance to make it into their dream group. They were all so enthusiastic even though they knew only half would make it. I admit I almost cried lol.


And (not specifically KPop but KPop adjacent) the [Idol Producer PPAP](https://youtu.be/71p55d1PpnY) stage was *so* not what I was expecting when I heard they were doing that song.

Also OT but is the list of stale topics not being updated anymore?  No idea if this is stale, lol.",125,1

There are a lot of talented singers who we tend to overlook or forget about. For me, part of the enjoyment of KoMS is seeing a lesser-known talent surprise everyone with a powerful performance.

Personally, Id send Kim Sunghee. She was the original main vocalist of Kara but left the group after failing university entrance exams, so shes only on the groups very early songs (pretty sure just their debut album). Her voice is powerful, she has a decently large range, and I like her vocal color.

I don't really like this as to me it just gives me the feeling that the idols and artists are marionette puppets being controlled by their producers and as a consumer i value authenticity a lot more than i do any other quality. This means i pretty much just gravitate towards YG artists because they seem to have a lot of freedom to express themselves in they way the prefer. I really like Tablo, he's like the Korean K.Dot, Big Bang was my introduction to kpop which is kind of bad because i'm pretty sure they're the reason i have such high expectations and Akdong Musician gives me a really good vibe. But i'm struggling to find any act outside of YG that meets my standards.

My name is Paul and I'm a music producer who worked with Korean rappers until he somehow started working with SM Ent.

Basically, my beat was confirmed by Paul Thompson from Marz Music and he now wants me to make a full demo of it.

I asked him if I could work with his songwriters, but he told me that his guys are too busy with their US stuff, which I totally understand.

Hence, I'm looking for a songwriter/songwriters to work on this beat and a couple other beats with me.

I don't care if you have past experience or not, as long as you're talented and able to provide me with some links or files of your work, so I can check out your stuff.

Now I am wondering, how is he able to speak so freely on his youtube channel? Since he's still a kpop star and all.. I don't know how to explain it. It's not like he is saying explicit stuff. I just feel like most companies try to control their artists to a certain degree. Does this not happen with Day6 and Jae?",3,1

BP is not a group I follow too much but it sort of disturbed me that a fandom can feel so abused and can be shaped by that abuse so much. It really made me rethink about the outlook of the fandoms and the way they think and act and the reason they are like that.

P.s. please notify me right away if the title is too vague/if the post violates any rule of kpop since that always seems to be a problem with me, the automoderator just removes it...

Most imp p.s. plz try not to make the whole thread abt YG hate, and no dragging/disrespect for any fandom.

923,2018-11-09,2018,11,9,5,9vdqf1,Which factors go into making a successful solo debut?,mhale203,1541709711,"Solo debut as in an idol from a group getting their own solo project whilst they're still in a group.

I've thought a lot about why Luna's solo didn't do well. She's a great singer and dancer, and at least I think she's beautiful (apparently knetizens don't think so? Idk that's what someone said). So why is Free Somebody largely forgotten?

If you compare her to Taeyeon--not the artists themselves but how their debuts went about--it's very interesting to see the differences. Taeyeon's ""I"" is one of my favorite songs in all of Kpop, but you have to admit that it was a safe choice. A powerful ballad-y song with gorgeous New Zealand scenery in the MV? That was always gonna be a hit, especially coming from the leader of the nation's girl group. But SM went more experimental with Luna by focusing Free Somebody more on the performance and less on vocals, hence the lack of a real chorus (side note: am I the only one who noticed that the instrumental hook of Free Somebody is basically the same as the hook in SHINee's Good Evening?). Also, the MV is definitely very different with the lighting, animation, and overall concept. I think Luna pulled it off well, but sadly it just wasn't a hit with the public.

Also, you have to consider their roles in their groups. Both main vocalists, yes, but Taeyeon's the most or second most popular in SNSD, the nation's girl group. Yes, she's got her fair share of haters, especially after Baekhyun, but she's undeniably one of the most admired and well known idols. f(x), while successful, don't have the same reputation as SNSD, and it seems like Luna was that one member people would overlook. Sulli and Krystal gained popularity for their visuals, Victoria has China, and international fans all love Amber. Luna, like EXO's Chen, is respected for her singing ability, but sadly she's not a lot of peoples' bias.

I guess I'm just sad that Luna hasn't been able to take off on her solo career, especially considering how f(x) have been treated these past three years. She's such a skilled artist in so many aspects (she and Taemin are the most multi-skilled idols when it comes to vocals and dance no shade just facts) and it sucks that she hasn't been appreciated by her company.

Anyway. Which idol group member's solo debuts would you say have been the most successful, and which have flopped? Why? And which idols do you think could have a successful solo debut?",37,1

They are extremely addicting. Which is crazy because I've always feel to the catagory of rap and rap only. Now I found out that they are winning awards in AMERICA! I guess they are the first Kpop group to successfully pass into America. And it's crazy because they are breaking records with 43 million views in less than 24 hours! And I guarantee you that half of the people listening to them don't even speak the language (I can't either). It really shows you that music doesn't have a language barrier. It can touch anyone anywhere. They work so damn hard and are the most talented boy bands even artists that I've ever saw. ,17,1

They weren't on any variety shows either except for happy together and that was only 2 members. They don't have a lot of group activites except for music shows and I read that their second upcoming fansign is their last already. SM groups and soloists are also coming back this month and key already did.

I thought as one of the groups, if not THE group that's been making SM a lot of money, they'd be promoted better not just in SNS. It's kind of unfair that after waiting so long, even when they made their comeback there's barely any content. This was supposed to be their grand comeback after a year but seems like the fans are the only ones working hard.

Does anyone know why they're being managed like this? Is their contract about to end? Is SM half-assing to prioritize newer groups instead? Or has SM always been like this?",29,1

Currently this post mostly to round up the western media articles (highly notable and usual for western media outlets to cover kpop) as a result of the incident as well as any oncoming events. 

Future news posts can be posted in the sub, but I'll do my best to recap them here over the next few days if anything else (hopefully not!) happens. 

If there's additional information, or articles that I have missed, you felt were not substantial enough to submit to the sub before but should be added here (tweets and so on), etc, please let me know. 

#Timeline of events

[BTS's Jimin wore a shirt depicting the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during WWII as seen in Burn the Stage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9s16gq/bts_jimin_draws_flack_over_shirt_that/) 

It's worth noting that no one really noticed the shirt for quite some time or they decided to ignore it, and the issue was raised far later as a serious matter by a resident of Japan. (political affiliation, and profession not mattering)

[BTS was then set to preform on Japan's TV Asahi Music Station on the 9th of November.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9tkaci/bts_to_perform_on_tv_asahi_music_station_on_9th/)

[However, Music Station then **postponed** the performance the day before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9v9vqf/music_station_cancelled_bts_stage_for_tomorrow/)

#Western Media Articles:

With western media, it's important to note that they some are saying that the performance is cancelled, instead of postponed.

Recently I found a lot of other NorCal (Northern California i.e. San Francisco, Oakland, Sacremento, etc.) folks in this sub, so I figured itd be cool to make a Discord for us. Itd be a place where we could hang out, brought together by K-Pop but not necessarily focused primarily on it! Itd also be a cool way to set up in-person meetups. 

If youre in the area, [**feel free to join**](https://discord.gg/nhcYdkN)! And invite your friends if they're cool with it too! If youre not in the area, you could still join anyway Youd just not be able to participate as easily in meetups as those of us in the bay or generally know the context to events specific to NorCal if that comes up in our conversations. 

I just made the server last week, so we're pretty small here. I'm not expecting to make it anything that complex though, just being chill is all I really hope for.

Synopsis: ""Welcome to se\* therapy."" - Abigail Aldaine is college student in Seattle who due to childhood trauma has lived most of her life with a rare phobia that has prevented her from ever being able to be touched by another human being again. Jaden Kim is a world famous therapist, who due to his jaw-dropping good looks, top test scores, and very wealthy father, has obtained some massive popularity within the university that they are both attending. Through some troubles at the school, Jaden discovers her human contact phobia, and becomes dead set on researching this rarity in exchange for curing her, by administering the exposure therapy himself.",2,1

My girlfriends birthday is in a few days, and, needless to say, I wouldnt be posting this if I had any idea what to get her. So, Ill just get to the point: do you guys have any good gift ideas? Im not too concerned with price range.

Relevant information:

She likes NCT, BTS, I think EXO, and I wish I could think of more. She went to a BTS concert a few months ago and got one of those Bluetooth strobe light things, and she LOVES it. She always orders albums and picture books and whatnot, so those are probably off the table too. If anyone needs anything I didnt include, Ill be sure to try to answer.

Im putting my faith in you guys, cause Ive exhausted my list of cute sweaters, Ghibli movies, and other dork stuff that shes into. But, I still love her, so I really hope you guys can think of something I cant. Id really appreciate it.

Thanks!",25,1

1111,2018-11-10,2018,11,10,17,9vstaz,Which members of the same group do you mix up a lot?,caralyn7,1541838747,"Ive been a huge fan of Lovelyz for years now but for some reason I still mix up Yein and Jisoo. They both have large eyes, similar eyebrows, and usually their hairstyles are similar too. I used to get Sujeong and Kei mixed up a lot too, but not so much as of late.

In Oh My Girl, I always get confused between Hyojong and Jiho. They look like they could be sisters, in my opinion.

When Happiness came out, I literally couldnt tell the difference between Irene, Joy, and Wendy if I didnt see the dyed parts of their hair. I continued to get Joy and Irene mixed up for a while actually, which is weird because Joy is much taller and they dont actually look anything alike.

I remember watching Wanna Ones debut and thinking that all of them had the exact same haircut and visual type. The only ones who stood out were Daniel (because duh) and Daehwi. To this day I still dont know the others lol.

When Sehun was younger and had a softer face, there were some times where he really did look like Luhan. Fun fact: I didnt become a kpop fan until late 2015 and EXO was my first group. I only knew the nine members but people kept talking about missing Taorishun and back then I didnt watch MVs so I thought only one member named Taorishun had left. Yup. ",207,1

As for Momoland, I love their infectious positive energy whenever they perform or be in variety shows or interviews. It's not just JooE that's lights up the room with her cheerfulness (although she mostly starts it), but everyone else is extremely jolly, which is very refreshing.

Lastly, I love how Day6 performs live all the time and still sound the same way they do when recording. It's a testament as to how vocally talented they are.

First of all Id like to discuss Chinese members in different groups. After EXOs comeback I think it is very accurate to talk about this. Yixing has been this one and only Chinese guy who hasnt left the group yet. People say that Lay hasnt been very active because of the China-Korea conflict and I cannot understand it. How can it be that NCT has so many Chinese members and they dont have any problem of not participating in comebacks or so. The same company, different treating?

But of course not everybody is on this sub for those reasons. There are trolls that want to rile everybody up they can, there are anti-fans that want to brigade the group they hate and *then* there are people who are being paid to spread awareness or say something specific about a group while pretending to be part of the normal user base.

Do you think this is a problem? Or do you think it's just course for the par? Should people who are advertising identify themselves?

Personally, I'm torn. On the one hand I don't really care so much and I think most of us are doing their marketing for them for free anyways, but on the other hand they are super blatant sometimes and I think they should at least be active in other ways, as well, to hide it better.

The companies who make these songs are too scared to actually innovate and make new, refreshing music. They are just using their idols as a cash grab. I bet if these idols were free to make their own music, some would actually make good music. It's basically like american pop, with nothing new aside from the language it's in. It is popular for all the wrong reasons. A lot of 13 year olds love this trash, i am of the same age but hate it as I am very critical when it comes to media. I don't like things just because they're popular, I like them if they're popular for the right reasons,and k-pop is not one of those things. They are capitalizing on a successful motif that was implemented in good songs, and when i go back to listen to the original, it sounds worse than i remember. You want your song to last long, then go make a new, good track instead of compiling a bunch of famous songs. Damn these companies are getting lazy. But the companies aren't the only problems, their slave ""ARMY"" of 11-13 year old k-pop version jake pauler girls are too. They can't accept any real criticism about their preferred genre.

I would like to share my knowledge about the current issue related to Korea, Japan, and the 'Atomic T-shirt' worn by BTS. I would like you to know that **I am not a fan of BTS, nationalist, nor anti-Japan.** **My contents and words may offend you but these are basically the historical fact based that you can easily find both in your world history books and online.** Meaning that I am not just scribbling down my thoughts. To be honest with the readers, I have engaged in writing this article with few others who share the same idea with me and posted on some other media or web pages as well to convince against the wrong rumors some people spread. I am telling this previously in order to prevent you from thinking me as just transporting other's groundless rumor and disturbing the discussion. Again, I would like to emphasize that **I am not trying to offend Japanese people but, instead, telling the genuine history of Korea that you may not be familiar with**; and I am **never saying** that all Japanese people are wrong and all Koreans are Right. Also, some may have seen this post somewhere online, in that case, I apologize for the duplication, but I wanted many people to read and understand why 'Atomic T-shirt' and two countries are the hot potatoes recently.

 

It was surprising to see some Japanese people cosplaying as if they were victims of the WWII by saying what would Americans feel if they encounter the September 11 Attack as prints on T-shirts? That is how we feel when we see the Atomic Attack prints. **The tragic history of the atomic bomb is very unfortunate. People who make the mockery on massacre should never be forgiven.** 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the shocking thing was that those Japanese who were comparing those two incidents seemed to never consider the situation before and after of **the Atomic Bomb Attack, which is different from the terrorism.** **The Atomic Massacre was eventually due to Japan not only started the war but also continued their attack despite other Nations dissuade.** Moreover, the US announced that they will drop the A-weapons in two Japanese cities, letting Japan evacuate to avoid mass-murder before the bombs were released. But, the Japanese government prevented their citizens from leaving the cities and made people suffer from tremendous damage.

 

During the WWII, many Asian countries and their people were victimized by the Japanese governments and militarys colonization. The Japanese sacrificed many innocent Asians in **forced-medical experiments (Unit 731 Maruta), sexual abusements (the Comfort Women: generally 12\~25 aged girls), and forcedly-drafted manpower (at the Mainland of Japan and the Battleship Island)**, and so on. The Japanese military also **attacked the Pearl Harbor without the declaration of war to the US.** That is why Americans struck Japan and dropped the Atomic bombs on Japan to make them surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

Some Japanese, mostly the nationalists (though many of the normal citizens of Japan may or may not agree with the nationalists), mock us Koreans to thank them because we were liberated due to the Atomic Attack. **But we do not consider this independence as a good liberation because not only the incident resulted in killing many people but also we failed to extinguish and punish all the pro-Japanese people, those who betrayed the mother nation during the illegal Korea colonization, from the chaos.** In other words, though it is very superb happiness to regain our Nation and rights, the liberation of Korea was not ideally achieved. 

&amp;#x200B;

People might say that the citizens of Japan have no fault. However, their looking in silence toward the Japanese government causing war, slaughtering innocent people, forcing women to comfort women, and experimenting on living bodies of the captives should not be defined merely as guiltless. As citizens of the past criminal nation, many of them even do not truly acknowledge why their country needs to apologize. Even though they do realize that they did the wrong thing in the past, they say the past is past. This is the result of the Japanese government avoiding to accept their blots and not educating their people genuine historical facts. **If you were a family member of the victim, do you think it is okay and easy for you to forgive the criminals wrongdoing on your grandparents because current children of the suspect do not acknowledge the incident well?** **I am not saying that the suspects children should carry the responsibility of persecuting our family, but they should have the responsibility of knowing the real history of their familys previous conviction and put effort to prevent the repeating of the wrongdoings.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the current BTS-MusicStation issue (the Japanese TV show canceling the casting of BTS right before the schedule due to the Atomic bomb T-shirt), it is hilarious to see people simply blaming the current Japanese imperialists. Do you think it is really only the Japanese imperialists who obstructed the broadcasting station from inviting BTS? No, to us, the primary reason for them to cancel is that more than half (maybe up to 80%) of the citizens are implicitly agreeing on the cancelation. **A broadcasting station is a company; to maintain their reputation, they have to embrace and follow the vast majority of their people (the local community).** 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, some say that the Atomic bomb print was too much. They must know this, **it does not mean that we are pleased and making fun of Japans destroyed by the Atomic Attack. Instead, it implies the sad history of our independence consequentially gained through the atomic bomb. And about 35,000 Koreans, who were forced to move to Japan at that time, were also sacrificed by the attack. Koreans cannot and do not ridicule the cruel history.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, it is very upsetting that some people complain why Japan should apologize consistently even though they did already. **The Japanese government did apologize in the Speeches such as Konos, and Koizumis, but visited the Yasukuni war shrine of worship concurrently, making the apology meaningless and untruthful.** The Yasukuni shrine praises the Japanese generals and people (soldiers and politicians) who were engaged in the WWII. **We define them as the war criminals who murdered and sacrificed our people, while the Japanese (at least their government) define them as their war heroes.** **Even today, the Japanese politicians still visit the shrine for worshipping.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, their history textbooks do not both fully and genuinely contain the facts and stories of their crimes, including the illegal Korea colonization and the WWII. They mainly emphasize their sacrifice from the Atomic Attack. They even distort the historical facts to benefit themselves. Such that, **they denied about the existence of the Comfort Women and Compulsory Manpower Draft though the survivors are still alive today** (The survivors are now very old, and most of them have passed away after suffering from aftereffects and without receiving an appropriate apology).

&amp;#x200B;

The Battleship Island (Hashima Island of Japan) is another reason many Koreans consider Japans apology as fake. **Japan has recently listed the Battleship Island, or Hashima Island, in UNESCO** as the site of Japans Meiji Industrial Revolution. Nonetheless, **the Japanese government refused to publish the historical fact that Koreans were forced to work during the colonized period** (many died due to starvation and overworking in the lousy environment) in the Battleship Island. **Instead, the Japanese government is announcing that the workers were not forcedly drafted but recruited.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Japans constant using of the Rising Sun flag has made us not to trust them.** **The Rising Sun of Japan is the symbol of the Japanese Imperialism which is equal to the Nazis Hakenkreuz. How and what would you feel if you see German constantly using the Hakenkreuz both publicly and privately?** (I apologize for both Germans and the readers if you were offended by this example.) Would you still feel comfortable seeing the Imperialistic logos and think ""I don't see any problem with using such a cool RS logo""? Their consistent use of the RS logo and flag cannot be assumed as them sincerely repenting their past crimes to us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, **some Japanese wandering around persuading others as if they are the innocent victim of the Atomic Massacre and driving the true victims as irrational and evil looks creepy and wicked to us. Again, the print of the Atomic Attack is not to ridicule the sacrificed people, but only to memorize our liberation and never to forget the crisis.** By the way, the T-shirt was worn 2 years ago, and the Japanese are politically issuing this as if it's currently worn, and, more importantly, claiming that BTS and Koreans are instigating anti-Japanese sentiments. **Do you think to feel pleasant and celebrating our liberation from the illegal colonization is encouraging the anti-Japanese sentiments? Or, do you think people who are distorting the history of the suffering of the victims, and making the mockery of our celebrating of independence is instigating anti-sentiments?** It is them, not us, who are continually making the anti-sentiments in East Asia for their political benefits in their country. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did not want BTS to be pulled into the political issues. But Japan has brought up with the historical problems and denounced both Korea and BTS with the distorted historical facts and interpretations, leading me to assume that, unlike many peoples wish of not relating BTS to the politics, this wont end unless the World and the Japanese people acknowledge the truth.

Other survival shows like No Mercy, BOYS24, Sixteen, Idol School, Mix9, dont seem to have these and I was hoping to catch up with old favorites on the show.

It's summarised here in this translation thread on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ponyofied/status/1061347603235782657). Korean fans have practically unanimously turned on him now.

He has written an apology note where he has admitted the instagram account is his.

tl:dr; It's not about him dating. It's because he had a private instagram that got exposed. It contained him complaining about JBJ fans and idol life. There is also controversy about how he treated his cats. He abandoned his cat Lucy on the streets (she is now in a cat shelter) and barely cared for the cats while they were in the dorm - leaving most of the work to other members.

Whereas we have non-Korean idols such as Kenta or Miya from GWSN, etc. etc. (and Im not calling them out negatively at all, just using an example) who were known to be kind of K-pop otakus and dressed/cosplayed liked idols and were in Kpop cover dance teams and so on but no one would ever call them a Koreaboo... even if what theyve done could be much more of a Koreaboo definition than some of the non-Asians who always get called koreaboo. 

Do you think this word is used from a place where some Kpop fans have jealousy and resentment of westerners who are thriving in Korea and have they live they think they want?

**NOTE** They are not showing the scores anymore in most of the cases. Some Performances, while shown on the show as little snippets, were not made available on YouTube. I have noted down the names of the songs I recognized, everyone else got a N/A.

For the rap performances: Self Produced means the contestant made both the beat and the lyrics themselves while Self Written means they just did Rap Making for an already existing beat.

You are invited to participate in my survey for my Bachelor Thesis in co-operation with my university. In this survey, you will be asked to complete a survey that asks questions about the impact of celebrity endorsement and influences from the Korean cultural wave.

This survey consists of two parts: Part one is the empirical part of my study which asks the general questions with influence from celebrity endorsements and purchasing decisions.

Part two consists of specific examples from 3 Korean celebrities and questions surrounding their influence in the global marketing strategies. Approximate time to complete the survey is 5 minutes.

Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. There are no foreseeable risks associated with this project. However, if you feel uncomfortable answering any questions, you can withdraw from the survey at any point. However, it is very important for my academic research to get to know your complete opinions and thoughts.

Your survey responses will be strictly confidential and data from this research will be reported only in the aggregate. Your information will remain confidential. If you have questions at any time about the survey or the procedures, you may contact me: Hyun Mo (Ollie) at hyun.koo@web.de Further feedback and comments are always welcomed.

1323,2018-11-12,2018,11,12,16,9wbvrp,How would you describe the signature style of certain groups?,caralyn7,1542006957,"Regardless of concept change, I think most groups still stick with a specific style/aesthetic in their songs and MVs. When you think of a group, how would you describe their image?

When I think of Monsta X, I associate them with technology and futuristic stuff. They were literally time travelers in Dramarama, and they usually have some kind of train or car in their videos. Theyre also a very hard-hitting group in general, from the choreo to the rapping to the choruses.

Infinite are hard to explain because I could go on for hours about my love for them, but the best way I can describe them is united. Unlike most groups these days where the chorus is only sung by one person and the dances are super intricate, Infinite always (except in Tell Me) has the whole group sing the chorus and dance in sync. Simple, but extremely effective.

Oh My Girl and WJSN both have that ethereal, magic aesthetic to them, but in different ways. OMG is a little more quirky sometimes with songs like Coloring Book and Windy Day, but their concept has always seemed very pure (also can I say that everything about Remember Me is so fucking beautiful). WJSN strike me as a little more mature sounding, especially with the last two tracks. They also take magic more literally too lol.

VIXX are just kings of darkness, and thats a fact. Theyre the certified angsty boys of Kpop and one of the few boy groups whose angst and dark concepts I can still get behind. Side note: Some of their scenes in their MVs come off as BDSM-y too lol. You have them wearing chokers as they sing about being chained up, Leo once stuffed a girl to keep her body after some angsty thing happened with a dress he made (am I remembering this MV correctly? Its been a while lol), Kens (beautiful) exposed back in Shangri-La, and then theyre fucking stabbing themselves in Voodoo Doll. Stay angsty, VIXX. Never change.",47,1

Which fandoms overlap the most and **why**?

Personally as a huge fan of EXID that hasn't gotten into the rest of the K-pop world too much (I've been pretty active for a few months but there's a lot out there) I've noticed that Leggos tend to be quite fond of Mamamoo and vice versa and it made me curious as to why. What I'm thinking is that it has something to do with the fact that they're both groups that never really do *cute* as a concept like most ggs tend to do, they strike me more as pretty independent girls for lack of better phrasing. Also another thing that I'm sure anyone will say about the groups they stan, but dare I say... talented vocals? ",154,1

And please feel free to share and give your feedback if you hope so.

Hi, I am Korean who studies abroad in one of the US universities. I would like to share my knowledge and assist you with a better understanding of the current BTS issue related to the Korea-Japan relationship. I would like you to know that I am not a fan of BTS, nationalist, nor anti-Japan. My contents and words may offend you but these are basically the historical fact based that you can easily find both in your world history books and online. Meaning that I am not just scribbling down my thoughts. To be honest with the readers, I have engaged in writing this article with few others who share the same idea with me and posted on some other media or web pages as well to convince against the wrong rumors some people spread. I am telling this previously in order to prevent you from thinking me as just transporting other's groundless rumor and disturbing the discussion. Again, I would like to emphasize that I am not trying to offend Japanese people but, instead, telling the genuine history of Korea that you may not be familiar with; and I am never saying that all Japanese people are wrong and all Koreans are Right. 

It was surprising to see some Japanese people cosplaying as if they were victims of the WWII by saying what would Americans feel if they encounter the September 11 Attack as prints on T-shirts? That is how we feel when we see the Atomic Attack prints. The tragic history of the atomic bomb is very unfortunate. People who make the mockery on massacre should never be forgiven. 

However, the shocking thing was that those Japanese who were comparing those two incidents seemed to never consider the situation before and after of the Atomic Bomb Attack, which is different from the terrorism. The Atomic Massacre was eventually due to Japan not only started the war but also continued their attack despite other Nations dissuade. Moreover, the US announced that they will drop the A-weapons in two Japanese cities, letting Japan evacuate to avoid mass-murder before the bombs were released. But, the Japanese government prevented their citizens from leaving the cities and made people suffer from tremendous damage. 

During the WWII, many Asian countries and their people were victimized by the Japanese governments and militarys colonization. The Japanese sacrificed many innocent Asians in forced-medical experiments (Unit 731 Maruta), sexual abusements (the Comfort Women), and forcedly-drafted manpower (at the Mainland of Japan and the Battleship Island), and so on. The Japanese military also attacked the Pearl Harbor without the declaration of war to the US. That is why Americans struck Japan and dropped the Atomic bombs on Japan to make them surrender. 

Some Japanese, mostly the nationalists (though many of the normal citizens of Japan may or may not agree with the nationalists), mock us Koreans to thank them because we were liberated due to the Atomic Attack. But we do not consider this independence as a good liberation because not only the incident resulted in killing many people but also we failed to extinguish and punish all the pro-Japanese people, those who betrayed the mother nation during the illegal Korea colonization, from the chaos. In other words, though it is very superb happiness to regain our Nation and rights, the liberation of Korea was not ideally achieved. 

People might say that the citizens of Japan have no fault. However, their looking in silence toward the Japanese government causing war, slaughtering innocent people, forcing young girls (generally aged between 12 and 25) to become the comfort women for the Japanese military, and experimenting on living bodies of the captives should not be defined merely as guiltless. As citizens of the past criminal nation, many of them even do not truly acknowledge why their country needs to apologize. Even though they do realize that they did the wrong thing in the past, they say the past is past. This is the result of the Japanese government avoiding to accept their blots and not educating their people genuine historical facts. If you were a family member of the victim, do you think it is okay and easy for you to forgive the criminals wrongdoing on your grandparents because current children of the suspect do not acknowledge the incident well? I am not saying that the suspects children should carry the responsibility of persecuting our family, but they should have the responsibility of knowing the real history of their familys previous conviction and put effort to prevent the repeating of the wrongdoings. 

Back to the current BTS-MusicStation issue (the Japanese TV show canceling the casting of BTS right before the schedule due to the Atomic bomb T-shirt), it is hilarious to see people simply blaming the current Japanese imperialists. Do you think it is really only the Japanese imperialists who obstructed the broadcasting station from inviting BTS? No, to us, the primary reason for them to cancel is that more than half (maybe up to 80%) of the citizens are implicitly agreeing on the cancelation. A broadcasting station is a company; to maintain their reputation, they have to embrace and follow the vast majority of their people. 

Also, some say that the Atomic bomb print was too much. They must know this, it does not mean that we are pleased and making fun of Japans destroyed by the Atomic Attack. Instead, it implies the sad history of our independence consequentially gained through the atomic bomb. And about 35,000 Koreans, who were forced to move to Japan at that time, were also sacrificed by the attack. Koreans cannot and do not ridicule the cruel history. 

Meanwhile, it is very upsetting that some people complain why Japan should apologize consistently even though they did already. The Japanese government did apologize in the Speeches such as Konos, and Koizumis, but visited the Yasukuni war shrine of worship concurrently, making the apology meaningless and untruthful. The Yasukuni shrine praises the Japanese generals and people (soldiers and politicians) who were engaged in the WWII. We define them as the war criminals who murdered and sacrificed our people, while the Japanese (at least their government) define them as their war heroes. Even today, the Japanese politicians still visit the shrine for worshipping. 

Moreover, their history textbooks do not both fully and genuinely contain the facts and stories of their crimes, including the illegal Korea colonization and the WWII. They mainly emphasize their sacrifice from the Atomic Attack. They even distort the historical facts to benefit themselves. Such that, they denied about the existence of the Comfort Women and Compulsory Manpower Draft though the survivors are still alive today (The survivors are now very old, and most of them have passed away after suffering from aftereffects and without receiving an appropriate apology). 

The Battleship Island (Hashima Island of Japan) is another reason many Koreans consider Japans apology as fake. Japan has recently listed the Battleship Island, or Hashima Island, in UNESCO as the site of Japans Meiji Industrial Revolution. Nonetheless, the Japanese government refused to publish the historical fact that Koreans were forced to work during the colonized period (many died due to starvation and overworking in the lousy environment) in the Battleship Island. Instead, the Japanese government is announcing that the workers were not forcedly drafted but recruited. 

Japans constant using of the Rising Sun flag has made us not to trust them. The Rising Sun of Japan is the symbol of the Japanese Imperialism which is equal to the Nazis Hakenkreuz. How and what would you feel if you see German constantly using the Hakenkreuz both publicly and privately? (I apologize for both Germans and the readers if you were offended by this example.) Would you still feel comfortable seeing the Imperialistic logos and think ""I don't see any problem with using such a cool RS logo""? Their consistent use of the RS logo and flag cannot be assumed as them sincerely repenting their past crimes to us.

 Therefore, some Japanese wandering around persuading others as if they are the innocent victim of the Atomic Massacre and driving the true victims as irrational and evil looks creepy and wicked to us. Again, the print of the Atomic Attack is not to ridicule the sacrificed people, but only to memorize our liberation and never to forget the crisis. By the way, the T-shirt was worn 2 years ago, and the Japanese are politically issuing this as if it's currently worn, and, more importantly, claiming that BTS and Koreans are instigating anti-Japanese sentiments. Do you think to feel pleasant and celebrating our liberation from the illegal colonization is encouraging the anti-Japanese sentiments? Or, do you think people who are distorting the history of the suffering of the victims, and making the mockery of our celebrating of independence is instigating anti-sentiments? It is them, not us, who are continually making the anti-sentiments in East Asia for their political benefits in their country. 

I did not want BTS to be pulled into the political issues. But Japan has brought up with the historical problems and denounced both Korea and BTS with the distorted historical facts and interpretations, leading me to assume that, unlike many peoples wish of not relating BTS to the politics, this wont end unless the World and the Japanese people acknowledge the truth. 

Besides, the T-shirt should be called the Liberation T-shirt, not the Atomic T-shirt. Even the designer initially intended the theme of the garment as 'independence' and 'patriotism,' not the mockery of sacrificed people from the Atomic Attack. I believe the usage of the word 'Atomic bomb T-shirt' was encouraged by the many media throughout the World, instigating anti-sentiments among people. The media should first stop using the word.

Again, I am not saying that all the Japanese people are bad. There are many really friendly, polite, honest and good Japanese people. It is those ""some"" Japanese people who are enhancing the anti-sentiments among people by spreading wrong rumors, and arguing &amp; fighting against people with total nonsense.

While not a pop group, Nell is an excellent band that was introduced to me through Infinite (fanboy Sunggyu) and the lead singer Kim Jong Wan(sometimes stylized as JW) has sung multiple osts and appears as a featuring on songs with Epik High, G-Dragon, Sunggyu, and the band recently featured on BTS' RM's mixtape for the track 'everthingoes'. I feel the need to briefly explain who Nell is because they aren't mention much on this sub and I adore the band.


On to business. Newly added to Apple Music, we have 2003's Let It Rain, 2004's Walk Through Me, 2008's The Trace, 2012's Holding Onto Gravity. Unfortunately, 2014's Newton's Apple is no longer available.

I'm unaware of what was previously available on Spotify for the band so I'm assuming 2012's Slip Away and Holding Onto Gravity are recently added. Newton's Apple is available on Spotify. The other albums I listed above for Apple Music are not available on Spotify, aside from Holding Onto Gravity.",28,1

1532,2018-11-13,2018,11,13,20,9wofbh,How Koreans feel About Jimin's T-shirt incident,solution1994,1542110063,"Hiiii, English isn't my first language so srry for lot of grammatical mistakes and errors. 

I saw in several online communities in and out of Korea talking about the recent BTS t-shirt incident, and wanted to say about how Koreans feel about it. This is my first post...so great if you guys can spread it out to other places. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that war is a tragedy, and deaths of the innocent is not sth to be laughed about. But we Koreans, though we don't say it out loud, most of us thinks that the Japanese deserved two Atomic bombs. (or maybe some more, if they didn't surrender) 

They killed our people, forbid the use of our language, raped our women(the comfort women), changed our names into Japanese, and many many more. It was a big part of our history, and we naturally feel anger when studying this part. Anything cruel you can think of a war, they did it to us. 

Then some might say, 'well, the people of now isn't the people who started the war, so isn't it too much for wearing that t-shirt?'. The problem is, at least we think that, the Japanese aren't reflecting about their actions. They rarely study about the part of their past during the ww2, and their prime minister annually pays respect to the A class war criminals who are enshrined in their temples. Unlike the Germans who seem to be embarrassed about Nazi, the Japanese deny their action or seem to be proud that they were able to declare war with the rest of the world. (This is a feeling I get from viewing several videos and documents, so it might be wrong. But their denial of the cruelty done to comfort women, and their recent reaction towards the independence day t-shirt hardens my belief)

So we know that many innocent died due to the atomic bombing, but that doesn't mean the Japanese are the victims of the war. It was total war during the end of ww2, every citizen of Japan had responsibility of the war. Then they suddenly act like the victims because they were killed 'a lot' 'at once'? Their victim playing makes us want to vomit, really. 

Me and many Koreans are proud of Jimin's action. We are ready to support him whenever he wears that shirt.

The matter is, we know the topic thing this week was ans is BTS.

Firstly, a megathread was post and it's good because the hole issue has to be discuss and it is useful and interteresting. But people used the thread just to atack BTS, Jimin, Armys and everyone who's opinion was different. I really don't have a problem with this is not mod's fault.

The surprise and why I call this sub and mods biased is when a thread was post talking about Armys hating Momoland. The thing is why don't eliminate a post which is clearly made to make fanwars but this would be ok if we could post this type of threads. The problem is why is just this thread that can be posted about fanwars?  Everybody knows that this type of fanwars happens all the time, all the fandoms do this things and Army too.

I think people just want to create more hate towards BTS and it's ok but when are the mods trying this is not ok. 

You are just giving reasons to Armys to hate the kpop community, to just listen to BTS and to just care about BTS problems.

In that  video of the instrumental for the K/DA ""Pop/Stars"" song, there are derogatory comments about how that song is so lit and how it's too good to be called K-Pop. Ignorant comments like that kind of triggers me because the people making those comments obviously have no idea what K-Pop actually encompasses, or how that song is actually quite similar to some K-Pop songs.

I tried my best to explain/educate in that thread, but I have to wonder why these people have those misconceptions to begin with? What's their actual level of exposure to K-Pop? What do they think K-Pop sounds like? BTS? Twice? BlackPink?

This really is just a rant, probably incoherent but wanted to get this off my chest.

That title is fitting because, at least online, that what it feels like. Now fan wars are nothing new but with kpop it's a whole new ball game.

Now I know some of these people are actual assess who get on online to start drama because they have nothing better to do with their lives but these days, People spend more time trying to tear each other apart with insults and death threats than just enjoying the music and the content that all these amazing artists put out. Is this how people live their lives?

The kpop community is not much of a family as some people claim it to be.

I deleted a twitter account because I wanted a fresh start because everything that was starting to coming across my timeline was people having fights over the dumbest things but even worst, they drag the artist into their kpop gang wars. You have people making fun of, wishing death and/or rooting for their failure. They dont treat them as people because if they did, 95% of the stuff they say, would not be written.

I found the only way to take myself out of the environment and stop interacting with other fans online which I joined to find other like-minded people. I created a new twitter account where I just follow artist and news to keep up.

Anyways, as I said, its just a mini rant I wanted to get off my chest.",0,1

I agree that Jimin was insensitive to wear a bomb t shirt, and BTS deserved to make an apology. On the other hand, i think the stance that the japanese media took was very insulting and inappropriate. Japan became an Imperialist state because most of its citizens agreed to do so. They loved war(Riots broke out in japan when the russo-japanese war ended because the japanese people wanted to prolong war and get more profit.) They shouted tenno heika banzai and started the pacific war. It was a gigantic bandwagon. It was most of the japanese people who promoted a imperialist state, the colonization of nearby countries and forced labor of koreans. I'm not saying that they deserved a bomb, nobody deserves that. But they shouldn't  play being innocent civilians or claiming to be the victims of ww2. Its just so hypocritical and sick.",4,1

It also doesn't mean that unmentioned members are least liked or favored. Which member's voice stands out the most for you during a song. Could be a vocalist or rapper. 

Or they're probably just your bias and you like their voice the most. Just decide how you answer this post. And if you list someone that isn't your bias, I'd like to know who's your bias then. 

Obviously this won't apply to all of their songs. Some members just have their shining moments in other songs. 

Examples could be:

1. Baekhyun from EXO(My bias is Kyungsoo)
2. Nayeon from TWICE(My bias is Tzuyu)
3. RM from BTS, also my bias
4. JB from GOT7(My bias is Jackson)
5. CL from 2NE1(My bias is Dara)

1735,2018-11-15,2018,11,15,5,9x3ma5,What variety/reality shows would you create for idols? And who would you send on it?,AyyThatGirl,1542226181,"I feel like there's not many variety shows that idols can go and promote themselves on but there's lots of things i'd love to see (cross group interaction for example) on variety shows.  I know fans of older generations talk about shows that they used to watch but don't air anymore so maybe also recreations of these shows!

One of my ideas would be a Wife Swap type show where two different leaders have to swap groups for 1-2 weeks. I would love to see Chorong (Apink) and Irene (Red Velvet) swap because they're not that different in terms of personality but Chorong can be [Scary](https://youtu.be/gd9_GO7YSEk) and i'd like to see how she deals with a younger group. I'd also love to see another leader deal with Twice because they're always so busy and not that many new groups have a lot of foreign members.

I liked Secret Unnie so as second season of that and I'd also like a show that's similar but maybe pairing up popular idols with lesser known ones e.g. Twice with Gugudan

1744,2018-11-15,2018,11,15,8,9x5g2r,What are you guys doing with your lives?,worldwidehandsomeu,1542238081,"TRIGGER WARNING: THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY ENJOY THE GENRE. It is only directed towards hardcore koreaboos.

Sometimes we see a musical preference as something that should be valued. However, you individuals take things to another level. Do you subhuman idiots understand how foolish you sound fantasizing about these artists, and literally giving up your own culture for theirs? As a Korean, you guys are the laughingstocks of our culture. 

Stick with your own culture, honestly cosplaying as a Korean is pathetic and cringy. If you feel this isolated form your own culture, see a psychiatrist. I say this in all seriousness. My ex best friend is a koreaboo, and she used to cosplay as her bias all the time. Not only did she cut off her family and friends in the process, she now acts like she can only speak Korean and will literally not interact with you if you talk to her in English. Shes white. 

Once again, theres no issue with liking the genre, but theres a limit to everything. Your idol will, most likely, never know who you are. No other fan of any genre fantasizes about their genres stars so much as you guys do, and its pathetic and disgusting. For example, I like American hip hop, yet I do not fantasize about marrying J cole. 

In conclusion, theres a reason you guys are literal memes on the internet: The extremity of your passion, which could even be called an addiction. Tone it down, and stop being so cringy and annoying.

The last time it was discussed in a thread was 3 years ago and I was wondering if there are any updates. I always find it interesting when some motifs are used in multiple songs in different ways.

Also I dont know if this is true or not, but I feel like [Golden Childs I See You ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c-xSXvRj5Rs) contains a sample of [Victons Remember Me](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uLvr9Q-iJcs) (I could be wrong).

1859,2018-11-16,2018,11,16,4,9xegeo,Essential/Useful KPop Sites and Tools - overall or fandom specific,Novadestin,1542310587,"In the past (*back in my day*... lol), it was much easier to follow KPop and stay up to date on things because there weren't that many sites around. Obviously, that's changed now and having seen/talked to some confused newer fans, I thought it might be helpful for KPop fans to round up everything they think is essential/useful when it comes to following KPop overall and/or things that might help someone get into a group/fandom (official accounts are obvious though, so you don't need to list those!). 

Also, while it's important to point out bad sites that people *shouldn't* follow (like AllKPop and NetizenBuzz), let's focus more on the sites/tools/etc that are good and helpful rather than wasting time on what's not.


**Overall - News / Info**

* [Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/) - best for overall news. Period. End of discussion.
* [Seoulbeats](http://seoulbeats.com/) - Personally, I don't care for their articles that much, but they do round up articles like ""week in review"" and ""unsung artist"" that are worth following for. 
* [Asian Junkie](http://www.asianjunkie.com/) and [Kpopalypse](https://kpopalypse.com/) - These two are going to get some very mixed opinions, but I think they're still worth listing. Asian Junkie is, among other things, a good place to get straight forward details about issues happening in the KPop world and, despite his divisive humor, Kpopalypse does write some good/detailed no bullshit articles (the ""Plagiarism Fun Times"" ones for example). He also does a new release round up, which is helpful if you don't have time to follow a bunch of stuff, and a ""nugu alert"" that features some really unknown artists and groups. 
* /r/kpop - While definitely not that great for following general news, it is a good place to see what's happening and important to the overall KPop community. It can be very overwhelming though because of the amount of posts it gets.

**Overall - Other**

* Music shows - Show Champion is posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPde4guD9yFBRzkxk2PatoA). Music bank is posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5BMQOsAB8hKUyHu9KI6yig). Inkigayo is posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_hnpJLQTvBkqALgapi_4g). MCD is posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbD8EppRX3ZwJSou-TVo90A). Music Core is posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe52oeb7Xv_KaJsEzcKXJJg). The Show is posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoRXPcv8XK5fAplLbk9PTww). Simply KPop is posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/arirangworld/featured?disable_polymer=1). (These are the station channels, so you'll find variety shows and such that they air on them too!)
* [IG Lives](https://www.youtube.com/user/arirangworld/featured?disable_polymer=1) - This channel posts a crap ton of IG lives; it's most smaller girl groups, but it seems like they've been expanding lately. [Here's another channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/lordzuqi/featured?disable_polymer=1), but I'm pretty sure they only do girl groups and female solo artists - sorry boy group fans! 
* [KPopinfo411](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/) - If you need the basic info for a group or want to look up new debuts, this is the place to go. They've been a bit slow on updates lately because the admins are busy irl, but it's still my go to. 
* Highlight medleys and music charts - This isn't a specific site or anything but rather a point you in the right direction kind of thing. If, like me, you're always busy, than you might not have time to listen to the full albums of all the groups you want to keep an eye on. As such, highlight medleys and music charts ([like this one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6O-BIpjWhd7ohzIMlltosQ)) are really helpful to at least get a taste of things and then you can look it up later if a song really catches your attention. And, if following a weekly chart is still too much for you, there are also [some channels](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgVrsAGkza0rBjMU90NbdRA) that do just new release videos too. 

**Vixx - Starlights**

* [Translated Vixx](http://translatedvixx.tumblr.com/) - The best place to go for English translated Vixx content. The admin is super sweet and does a great job of making sure everything is explained well. 
* [FY! Vixx](http://fyeah-vixx.tumblr.com/) - This site is closed now, but it's a great archive source. 
* [@nimiovnimio](https://twitter.com/nimiovnimio) - Basically all Vixx media and info in one place. It is in Korean, but having it all organized and together is really helpful!
* [Starlights Gift](http://starlightsgift.com/) - Starlight's subbing team (there are others, of course, but these guys are the biggest). 
* byPinkerbell - Pinkerbell is the go to for high quality Vixx video files, but she has a tendency to go MIA (like rn) and her accounts tend to be suspended (for obvious reasons) so it can be tough to follow her - but totally worth it when she's active!

**Gugudan - Dear Friends**

* [@gu9udans](https://twitter.com/gu9udans) - The main fanbase for all things Gugudan. They've got twitter, IG, tumblr, and I think some other sites too.
* [G9DVN Subbing Team](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA8-Uj6s2FcOd4kZYHw13bQ) - A video subbing team that does English and Vietnamese subs. 
* [@_sejeongdays](https://twitter.com/_sejeongdays) - While this fanbase is specifically Sejeong biased, they are a good place to snap up some translated articles and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAEgzESn6AOmFc8aLsTQlJg).

**Tools**

* [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) - I find it crazy that a lot of people still manually go to dozens of sites everyday and try to track everything. Why make your life so hard? Feeds bring everything to one place and organize it. Also, if you can filter them, you can save even more time!
* [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) - This is perhaps a little unconventional, but this program gives me the ability to display upcoming releases and such [right on my desktop](https://i.imgur.com/NH02Znx.png) in a neat and tidy fashion. 
* [FoxReplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/) - This one only works if you use the Firefox browser or a derivative, but it's helpful (after you set it up of course) in instantly translating Korean words for sites like fancafes (where you just want to know which link to click for what you know lol) - just don't forget that it's on though xD

Alright, what are some other useful sites and such that you can think of for KPop or your own fandoms?",90,1

If you don't know what r/kpop sings is, I'm genuinely sad for you. Check out our previous releases on [our youtube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ).

&amp;nbsp;

As you might have gathered from the end of our [Special Halloween MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhA8yn_wkAA), r/kpop sings is coming back with a wonderfully festive Christmas release!!! 

&amp;nbsp;

----

We're sticking to a couple of things that worked super well from the Halloween release schedule to give us some more time since we're again aiming for a specific holiday release date:

**No nomination period, pre-selected song options, and a shortened voting period.**

----

#**Facts and Gentle Reminders**
(Please read before you post your concerns/questions!!!)

&amp;nbsp;

**Not every Christmas song ever is on this list and *we know*.** 

We went through and evaluated every single k-pop song ever for **two factors**: Christmassy-ness and availability of an instrumental. If a song you want isn't on there, it failed one or both of those qualities. If a song came out in the winter but is not explicitly wintery/Christmassy, sorry, it's out. Not a ton of HQ Christmas song instrumentals out there, which also eliminated a ton of songs. We also excluded all non-original songs, because we're not doing a cover of someone covering Bing Crosby. If there is a *blatantly* *Christmas-y* song that we missed with a *HQ official instrumental available*, go ahead and tell me, but otherwise, ~~keep your stupid comments in your pocket~~ please refrain from complaining, a lot of my favorites had to be eliminated too.

&amp;nbsp;

**This is called a ""Christmas"" release instead of a Winter Holiday release because Christmas is really the only winter Holiday celebrated in Korea. We are not trying to exclude anyone.**

However, if I somehow missed a k-pop song about Hanukkah please let me know.

&amp;nbsp;

**Boy and Girl Groups are nominated this round**

There's so few Christmas songs available, it'd be a shame to exclude any. The cycle of gg/bg will resume in 2019's first release.

&amp;nbsp;

**So far we have covered FOUR vocally complex songs by SM artists.**

I just wanted to point that fact out. On an unrelated note, variety is the spice of life. Remember that this is not a *favorite* Christmas song poll, but rather a ""which Christmas song would you like people to contribute to singing"" poll. You can obviously still vote if you don't plan to participate, but we'd *really* like you to participate if you vote. We've lain in [a lot of beds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAqamoiej1U) that other people have helped make.

#Voting will close THIS MONDAY PM

*Ahhhh that's so soon ahhhh* yeah well we want more time for yall to submit your vocals this round since like, *no one* did for Lucifer, so that's how the Christmas cookie crumbles, sorry kids. No specific time because I'll do it when I feel like it.

As always, thanks to the mods, our amazing team, everyone who's contributed and the community for being so enthusiastic. We're gonna get [festive af](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRxohmXVQAIC6qq.jpg).

Then as I followed the group I started to know more about her struggles against OT4 fans and hate comments, and the fact that I do not want her smile to disappear made me love her more and more.

I have been visiting this sub regularly for about 2 years now, and I wanted to take this opportunity to give something back.  We may have our problems, we may argue, squabble, and disagree on many things, but I personally feel like this community does a hell of a lot better job at providing a place where we can have meaningful discussions and keep up to date with the most recent news in the Kpop landscape without a bunch of drama than any other English kpop forum.  While we all have issues at times with the moderators, they do a good job in regulating the stuff that gets posted here and makes sure this community stays productive.  

As such, I wanted to give back to this community and its mods, and in order to do that, I will be giving away **20** brand new, unopened albums of YOUR choice.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

19 of those albums will be open to everybody, and 1 will be reserved for a moderator, should one or more choose to enter.  If no mods wish to enter, all 20 will be randomly selected from all the entries.

There are a couple of rules on what albums you may choose should you win:

1.  The album must be from this year.  You may choose an album that is scheduled to release by the end of the year or one that has previously been released this year.

2.  The album must be available on Amazon (most are) and cost no more than $50. 

3.  It must be an ALBUM, no monographs, DVDs, or any other non-album merch.


Winners can take this opportunity to pick up an album they missed this year or one they are looking forward to in the coming month.  Winners WILL be able to choose the version of the album they want as long as it is available.

In the spirit of Christmas, I will also allow the winner to give their album away as a gift to a friend.  I will pay the extra cost to have it shipped as a gift, with a personal message from you, to a friend's address, should you choose to go that route.

You might be wondering why I am doing a Christmas giveaway in the middle of November, but my reasoning is I want all the winners to receive their albums by Christmas, and shipping times during the holidays being what they are, I felt better safe than sorry.
________________________________________________________________________

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:


1.  What is your pick for Song of the Year?

2.  What is your pick for Music Video of the Year?

3.  What was the favorite thing your bias group did this year? (Can be a comeback or something else)

Please try to give more than just one word answers and explain your choices.  Its just more fun that way!


I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I am adding a new rule this giveaway.  If you are mostly a lurker here on reddit but you are active in the major group discords or the .Kpop discord, you may still enter, just leave your discord name on your entry or PM me if you are uncomfortable having that information public, and I will check your activity on discord and approve your entry accordingly. 

Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or answers to the entry questions.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  This giveaway is for the /r/kpop community and is not a free handout to people who dont contribute here.

I do want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

*I want to note that Australia is unfortunately on the watch list for being restricted for entry because Amazon has stopped delivering to Australia after introducing Amazon.au (which has far less Kpop album stock).  Hopefully I don't need to put in that restriction in the future, but I am just giving the heads up.  You may still enter this giveaway if from Australia.*

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.  And just so people know I am not kidding, I can confirm there are multiple people who have won 2 giveaways.**",354,1

I love listening to Brown Eyed Soul and Naul's Solo works.  I truly believe these are the only only guys left who has so much respect for older music (in my opinion music that influences todays music)  I see that they are truly passionate with R&amp;B/SouL/Funk.  Always excited to see what ideas they gonna be having next for a re-invention of older music styles.  Everytime is always something different and not just melody but  rhythm as well.  Vocals tenor all to falsetto.  Some songs are pure falsetto notes.. others are all tenor.  Some are a good mix.  These guys and the rest of the gifted guys at the studio (keyboardist, drummer, guitarist.)  all are truly a blessing.

It's 2018 and its great to hear older sounds introduced to the new generation.  Until Brown Eyed Soul's 5th album releases I would love to hear something like George Benson's - ""Give Me The Night"".   Such a groovy track that fits among the styles that Brown Eyed Soul creates.

There has been some news already published on how BigHit issued an apology to the South Korean victims of the atomic bomb regarding some recent controversy. However, the article didn't cover the entirety of the association's statement and I felt that several of their translations lost some meaning along the way. When I read the association's original statement I was very deeply touched by the gravity and poignancy of their words, and felt that their voice and strong message shouldn't go unheard just because of something as simple as a language barrier.

I am not a translator by any means but I tried very hard to convey the emotions and the tone of the entire original statement while preserving the accuracy of the words as much as I can. It's far from perfect, so if there are any mistakes you notice in my translation please let me know.

Here is the original statement: http://www.newsrep.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=60356

---------------

We are thankful for the opportunity to address our position as victims of the atomic bomb to so many national and foreign journalists as well as BigHit Entertainment in this small peace-loving city of Hapcheon.

Through their ""LOVE MYSELF"" campaign, BTS has been delivering messages of hopes and dreams to youths and all others residing all over the world. They are delivering messages of hope particularly to the countless teenagers and adults who are struggling with depression and self-esteem.

We, the victims of the atomic bomb, have also been receiving the same comfort from their work. We believe that BTS' message and activism sets an example that all of humanity should gather behind in support.

2019 will mark the 74th anniversary of the atomic bomb.

Of the 100,000 Koreans who became victims of the atomic bombs that were dropped on top of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, only 2,400 still survive. The 15,000 first-generation descendants of the original survivors, and their descendants after them, continue to suffer from numerous diseases and chronic conditions due to the aftereffects of the bombs. They have struggled to live under the ignorance of and lack of support from the government and society at large.

But even now it is not too late to repair past damages; we propose that a survey regarding the lives of the Korean atomic bomb victims and their descendants be initiated. It is not too late to amend the Special Act on the Atomic Bomb Victims legislation to allow for medical support.

We propose that a memorial park be built with a monument in remembrance of the 50,000 Korean atomic bomb survivors who later died in agony, including an archive dedicated to educating future generations about this history. We request that mental health services be initiated to help heal the trauma inflicted by the atomic bomb, even with the limited remaining lifespan of many of the victims. We wish to propose a Hapcheon Denuclearization Peace Assembly which will promote a peaceful world free from nuclear weapons, as well as a memorial service dedicated to all victims of nuclear bombs. We would suggest the attendance of the President of South Korea with the hopes that this will ignite the attention and interest of the nation.

We Korean victims of the atomic bomb have not received, for 73 years, a single apology from the United States of America - the nation responsible for dropping the atomic bombs - or Japan - the nation responsible for committing war crimes. We have lived as forgotten entities, having not received any interest or support from the liberated South Korean government during this same time. Now with these series of events we have been presented with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to speak up and be heard.

We have been astonished by some of the Japanese media's behaviors in response to the fact that a member of BTS wore a shirt printed with a picture of the atomic bomb explosion, cosplaying as if Japan were the only victim involved in the atomic bombing. Ignorant of their nation's history as perpetrators of war crimes and imperialism, the Japanese broadcasting companies involved in this incident abruptly canceled BTS' performance on national television and criticized the South Korean supreme court's ruling regarding the forced labor of Koreans by the Japanese.

In consideration of the above, we the victims of the atomic bomb understand and empathize with BTS, which has been under fire from multiple sides, and we humbly accept BigHit's apology.

For a moment we would like to set aside the perspective that the atomic bombs liberated Korea from Japanese colonialism, and instead wish for everyone to reflect on the inhumanity of dropping nuclear weapons on Japan, at that time already a nation on the verge of defeat, for the purposes of experimentation which indiscriminately killed not only humans but all life forms in its path. From now on, we hope that both the Japanese government and Japanese media will no longer mislead public opinion or distort information, and allow BTS to perform without further disruption. We especially wish to emphasize that BigHit's apology statement should not be manipulated or used for political maneuvering against Korea or BTS.

We sincerely hope that there will be no further reason for more victims of the atomic bomb to arise in the Korean peninsula or the world. We hope for your continued attention for the victims of the atomic bomb.

We tentatively hope that next year on August 6th, the 74th anniversary of the atomic bombing, BTS will come to perform at Hapcheon, known as the Hiroshima of Korea(1), to spread the message of ""a world without nuclear weapons, a peaceful global community"" with the living victims of the atomic bomb.

We have lived a life full of han(2) as victims of the atomic bomb and had the traumas of our experience passed down to the next generation, but we hope that this will become the foundation and first step toward a denuclearized peace on the Korean peninsula and serve as a warning to never repeat the mistakes of the past. Thank you.

(1) Hapcheon is a city where most current surviving Korean victims of the atomic bomb reside. As a result, the city is known as the Hiroshima of Korea. (2) han(): a unique Korean word that encapsulates the feeling of sorrow, suffering, and bitterness that is often passed through generations.",100,1

The first group I ever got into was BigBang. After learning the members, it sort of made sense why fans always use their stage names, as Seungri and T.O.P have the same first name. After getting into BTS, I had an urge to always use their first names. For example, you almost never run into someone online who will call Namjoon RM, I don't know if it's an unspoken rule or not. It's not something you ever see with Western artists, you'll never see someone calling Eminem by Marshall for example. This isn't a big issue, just something I want to discuss. ",57,1

Some might not feel the concept suits them well, but are good sports and don't let it show and their best.

Taeyeon of SNSD is known for really hating the cute concepts but had to do them anyway. And the songs she hated ended up becoming the most popular and iconic songs in K-Pop. 

Kris was known for hating everything he had to do in EXO, and after he left he made that very clear. 

Twice's Chaeyoung and Jeongyeon also are known to dislike cute concepts, but are stuck in a gg that does nothing but cute concepts. 

Stellar was known for changing to a sexy concept out of desperation, but they prefer cute/innocent concepts. 

Oh My Girl is a group that seems to really embrace/love their concepts. 

Pristin seemed to embrace whatever concepts they do, likely because they have a lot of creative input. 

Loona is a special case where each girl got their own solos and there are sub-units. It seems most of them love/embrace their concepts, but some are clearly more suited for specific concepts. They haven't expressed negativity for having to do concepts that might not suit them as much (such as Kim Lip doing ""Hi High""). 

Any other examples you can think of?

Acrostic poems - I've never heard of these before, but it seems like in almost every variety or radio show (weekly idol, idol room, running man, knowing brothers) they ask idols to make one up 

Honorifics  - they seem to really take the unnie/oppa/hyung (etc) system very seriously. i've seen hate thrown towards groups who don't bow to other groups (momoland). where i live, most people at least try to use a somewhat similar system (calling strangers sir or mam) but it doesn't seem to be a big of a deal as in south korea.

Drinking - in most ways koreans seem more modest than americans except when it comes to drinking. i feel like its more acceptable to talk about drinking or being drunk in korea than america.",132,1

Example:
Boy Band
Baekhyun, Kai (EXO), ONEW, Taemin (SHINee), L (infinite), V (bts), and Kim Jinwoo (Winner)

The debut album will be a mini album featuring five songs. Two will have MVs. One will be a cool song similar to Growl of EXO. The other will be a slow love ballad. First song will take place in a garage, with each member showing up in cool looking cars (product placement lol)! Kai leads the dancing with a choreo similar to exos DMUMT. Second song is a ballad about a guy falling in love with a girl but wont ever be able to because the girl is dying (tragic and sad). Here, Id personally give the most lines to Baekhyun, L, ONEW, and Jinwoo (so sorry if I cut out your biases). The rest of the songs are just cool, catchy songs that would probably be modeled off of iKON or Love Me Love Me from Winner.

P.S: Girl Group is harder and Im still thinking lol so many girls are talented and Ive got way too many biases. Ill probably comment down later.",10,1

I lightened mine every ~2 months for nearly a decade but since I'm a guy I was able to hide damage by cutting ends. Kpop idols with longer hair that have constant color changes would likely be so much better with wigs to prevent/reduce damage yet overall they're seemingly rare.                
Why are full-wigs not utilized as much in kpop as they are in western popculture/entertainment? We often see extensions, for better or worse... looking at you Qri, but very rarely do idols / idol stylists prefer wigs for bright colors instead of frying the idol's hair.",66,1

* I've also seen that instead of eating, they just get iv medication. The only thing I can see that would replace food would be Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)/lipids and even that messes up the body.

2164,2018-11-18,2018,11,18,23,9y6ju7,My one month in Korea with kpop - part one,Kronoxic,1542553038,"Hello!

I was in Korea from 4th October to 4th November this year and during my one month there only 7 days I didn't do anything related to kpop. And here is my story.

I arrived to Korea on 4th October in the morning and after leaving my luggage in a stay and do some refreshing I went straight to Gangnam to take some photos of Irene  before ABC Mart event in their store. Unfortunately I wasn't able to take any photos because Irene entered the store from backside :(

I've planned that on the following day I will go to get my sim card and after go in front of KBS to take some photos of idols before Music Bank. Unfortunately the typhoon arrived to Korea and I had to change my plan. After I received my sim card, I went to buy a 15 album of WJSN in order to attend a fansign on Sunday. For myself I've bought only 3 albums, the rest was a group order. After this I went to eat a lunch in Hapjeong. After the lunch I checked the receipt, because I was concerned that something might be not right. I've noticed that cashier charge additionally for books to learning English in Korean. I was like ""what?"". On Saturday I went to the store to solve it. I get refund but I had to pay one more time for albums. And here is a tricky part. I was paying by card and since my card is not issued in Korea I had to wait few days for the money. After paying second time for albums my budget was about 20000 KRW. I was waiting for salary which will be transferred to my account until 10th October. Luckily I have friends in Korea so I borrowed some money from them :) And guess what, I wasn't on the list for fansign :(

On sunday I went to Ssireum festival. Originally this festival was planned for Saturday but because of typhoon the date was change. You may ask I'm writing about Ssireum festival? It's because during this festival Momoland had their perfomance! I was there at the 11:00am and their stage was at 3:00pm. During waiting time for them I ate bibimbap for free and see some ssireum competition for schools. Momoland had a great performance but only 2 songs. I took a lot of photos and I was very happy because my bias in Momoland was looking at me during performing. My bias is Yeonwoo :) And here are the photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157700591885201/

On Monday I wasn't planning anything related to kpop so I went to Myeongdong and eat in an affordable one star Michelin restaurant. After lunch I went to Namdaemun Market to window shopping of cameras. Normally on Monday companies update schedule of their artists. So I decided to check fancafes and I stopped at Oh My Girl schedule. It was around 5:00pm and Oh My Girl had a performance at 7:00pm and I was in Namdaemun without tele lens. I had similar situation with Oh My Girl last and I wasn't able to see them. This year was different. I rushed to my stay in Sinchon to grab a needed lens and go the Gwanghwamun Plaza where they had a performance. I arrived 1 hour before of show start. So I was able to find a good spot :) It was a festival in commemorate Hangul Day and there were other artist there too but I didn't knew majority of them. Oh My Girl were performing 2nd from the end and was kinda rushed because I was meeting my friend in Hongdae. Luckily I changed the meeting hour :) Oh My Girl performed around 4 songs and I was very happy that this year I was able to see them :) And here is the link for my photos from this event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157698990829142/

OK, let's move to the next event. It was on Thursday and it was Momoland again. This time I went to Kyung Hee University Festival. I arrived 3 hours before the show start to find a good spot. It was a good idea to be there so early because I was standing in front of stage and had clear view for taking photos. Before Momoland performance there was Zion.T and here are some photos of him: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157702138657954/ Finally Momoland arrived but without Jooe which was shooting for Real Man at that time. This time Momoland performed all of their title songs so I was very happy because of it. During their performance I shooting photos and Yeonwoo was remembering me from Sunday because she was very often looking at me. You could say that Yeonwoo is my sealed bias in Momoland XD Here is the link:

One more thing. On the same day I've bought albums to attend Dreamcatcher fansign on sunday 14th. I was first person to applied XD

Next we have a Friday which means Music Bank. I woke up early and planned to be there on 8:00 am. Since it was a rush hour I arrived to Yeoeuido at 9:00 am. I was able to take some photos of Uni.T (Yebin, Euijin, NC.A, Yoonjo, Woohee), Luda from WJSN, Kei from Lovelyz, Dreamcatcher (Sua, Siyeon, Yoohyeon, Handong, Jiu) and Yuri from SNSD. It was chill until WJSN and Kei arrived. It was hella of mess. And here is one disclaimer I didn't took photos of idols which didn't wanted be on photos or wasn't able to shoot because of a mess. Here is the link: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157702335615685/

If you think that this was peak of my travel to Korea, you are in a mistake. It's just a beginning :) On Saturday I've done 2 things to related to kpop. I registered to attend for Inkigayo on Dreamcatcher fancafe and I've checked if I was on the of attendance for Dreamcatcher's fansign. This time I was! I was very happy!

On sunday I went Inkigayo for pre recordings of Dreamcatcher. It was my first time going to the music show with a fandom so I had no idea what to expect. I arrived before line check-up. After check-up I recieved slogan, event attendance book/journal. There was pre recordings of Dreamcatcher. During this I was learning how to shout a fanchant. The pre recordings finishied later than I expected and I had to choose between being not able to go for live Inkigayo or fansign. Because I didn't have a camera and an album with me during pre-recordings I decided to go to my stay to grab it and return to SBS. I was kinda late for second line check but luckily there were some spare tickets. Next problem was my camera gear. Strangely you can't enter with it to live show, so I had to hide it in a coin locker. Before entering to live show security checked everyone's backpacks or bag. It's just stupid. The show was great, I saw a lot of artists. When I was exiting from the hall I almost bumped into Taeyeon. That Taeyeon, SNSD Taeyeon. OMG! I didn't know what to say! 

After Inkigayo I went straight do Dreamcatcher fansign place. Regarding fansign. I can hardly remember anything about it  It's good that I have autographs because I would not believe it. All the girls praised me for Korean and that's what I remember. Sua, Jiu and Yoohyeon hold my hand. Regarding the questions which I've prepared on post it. At first there was Sua. Her favorite Dreamcatcher song is May day. Then Handong, who would like to try the very golden hair color. Then Siyeon. She would like to make a cover for Sia's song - Alive. When it comes to Jiu, he likes Chase Me the most. Yoohyeon recommends Day6 -  for autumn. Gahyeon likes to sleep in hes spare time. Dami would like to work on a song with SNSD and all artists from abroad. I've took took a lot of photos and it happened that I took a lot of photos of Handong. I like all of Dreamcatcher but a little bit more Handong, because I had great link with her. You know what I mean :p Overall it was an exhausting day but meeting all of idols which I like was a great reward. And here are the photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157700885430071/

Then we have a second week of my stay in Korea and let's start it with another show. This time it was Immortal Songs. Shooting takes place in the same hall as Music Bank and the recordings for this show takes 3 hours because before every song they need to prepare the stage. And during the break time MC Dingdong is doing some kinda of a show for audience. For example he asked audience what was the reason to go this show, someone was answering and invited to stage for the additional questions. When I saw what is going on I was 100% sure that MC will ask me some questions XD MC Dingdong asked where I'm from and I was stage invited to stage for other typical korean questions like age etc. Stepping on the same stage as idols was like WOW! Yeah XD. After short interview I receieved a signed Dreamcatcher album. You can see me at 4:46 and 9:30 in this video https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6wm582  After the shooting I took this video with my phone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0c8PwIF3RY 

Then we have SBS The Show. I went to pre recordings and live show. Between pre recordings and live show there was a high touch event with Dreamcatcher. It was very rushed but I was able to talk to every member for a very short moment. I've told that their stage on Immortal Songs was great. But for Handong I said that my friend became a fan of Dreamcatcher because of her. I've noticed that Dongie was happy :) Handong is very nice and warm. Ok, let's move on. Here are the photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157699277513732/

Then I went to Show Champion. It was great because I was in first row standing but on the right side. People which height is above 170 cm need stand on sides because if they stand in the middle they could block cameras. The show was very good but I've done which I regret now. Like I wrote I was in first row and behind me there were fromis_9 fans. Before stage of fromis_9 the do some interactions with fans. I was standing idle because there is a notice on fancafe board that if you caught cheering for other teams you can be excluded. And then Chaeyoung started waving and smiling to me. I thought that she was waving to someone behind but nah it was for me. She saddened for a moment that I didn't wave back. I could see that clearly. And then I was I like: omg what Ive done :( Now it's time for Dreamcatcher stage and Handong noticed me first before the stage. I was kind far away from other InSomnias because the security staff told me to go to other side. The stage was perfect I had great time!

Then we have MCountdown. Great show but I had pretty bad spot for looking at the stage but great for MC. And one of the special MC for this show was Bona from WJSN, my bias. When she smiled to me I was in heaven for a short time. The show started and we have a Dreamcatcher stage. Like always it was lit, like on the rock concert.

It's again Friday so Music Bank. From last time I've learned that good time to be there is around 12:30 pm. That's when idols arrive from other schedules. Before going to KBS  I went to buy Dreamcatcher albums for fansign but time I didn't had luck because I've bought 2 albums and minimum is 3... Ok, this time I was able to take some photos of Kei, Exy, Bona and Luda, Jinsol and Rachel from April and Dreamcatcher. And I was able to go for live Music Bank.  Here are my photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157701046819321/

Then it's Saturday which means Music Core. Luckily I was standing very close to the stage but on the side. This time I waved to Chaeyoung from fromis_9 and she looked happy. Then we have Dreamcatcher and before their stage Handong was first to noticed me. Stage was great like always. After Music Core I rushed to WJSN performance. Since I arrived late I had bad spot on the side of the stage but being able to take some photos. I was very happy that I took nice photos of Bona and Luda. I wanted to take photos of all members but It was hard because of my spot. Here are photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157701117857111/

Now it's time to say goodbye for Dreamcatcher on live shows :( It was Sunday which means Inkigayo. I went to pre recordings and after it there was a mini fanmeeting. The pre recordings finished around 11:50 am and the meeting time for fanmeeting was at 12:15 pm. But I misheard it and I thought that meeting is on 12:50 pm. I thought I had a plenty  of time so go to eat a lunch to homeplus near SBS. I went there with my friend from Singapore and she was in awe that I can eat that fast. She bought some beverage, and I ordered bibimbap for myself. And I thought that something is wrong. I asked my friend, what she heard and she said that meeting time is at 12:15 pm. I received my meal 12:12 pm. I ate bibimbap in 2 minutes and rushed with my friend to SBS. Luckily we have encountered fan manager and fans while they were going to fanmeeting place. We were saved!  Fanmeeting was good, I've took a lot of photos. After the fanmeeting everyone received a Inkigayo Sandwich. I went for last live of What on Inkigayo and after the saw barely speaking because of the fanchanting. After pre recordings I had some trouble with speaking loud but after the live it was worse. I had troubles with speaking  through 2 days straight XD Here are photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/sets/72157701147369451/

After Sunday I had 3 longest day in Korea because nothing was happening. Luckily I was meeting with my friend on Monday and do some sightseeing on the following day so it wasn't that. I was feeling sad that I'm not seeing Dreamcatcher and there is none live show and other artists don't have any schedule. And then notice about fansign of April arrived. I could buy their albums and go to music shows. Honestly April wasn't a group which I follow like Dreamcatcher or WJSN but it changed. During my first trip to Korea I received a signed album of April, and during second time in Korea April was promoting Take My Hand and I wanted to go for their fansign and go to music shows with them but I had no idea how to do this. But this year it was different!

And now let's make some brake because I'm writing this for too long. I think that splitting this for 2 parts will be a good idea and about my last 2 weeks in Korea I'd like to write it in another post in next week. I have a lot to share :) Thank you  :)

And Queen's legendary performance(often considered as the greatest rock performance of all time) got me thinking; what is the 'Live aid' of kpop?

Though I'm not the biggest fan of kpop, I'm very interested in its rise, evolution, and more than anything, legacy. kpop isn't exactly new, but certainly isn't a time-hardened, well seasoned type genre. Many people considered it corny and mass-produced music and many still do, though ignoring its influence on the current music scene is just failing to see reality. What could be the 'Live Aid' or 'Moonwalk' of kpop: one that is recognized by all as a legend and solidifies kpop's legacy?",11,3

I love putting songs that could work as sequels next to each other on my playlist whether or not they actually are. For example, I have Shine - Pentagon playing right after Babe - Hyuna coz I think they go so well in terms of music and it's sort of like hearing about a relationship from the girl's side then getting the prequel from the boy's side.

In terms of official sequels, I love listening to Love Sick right after Replay.

However, what are some instances, big or small, when you were proud of an idol **doing more than the bare minimum** and going out of their way to be respectful and sensitive of other demographics, classes, and cultures? 

For me, being an Asian myself, I find that a lot of Asians tend to enforce gender roles on their children (this is prominent in Western countries as well, but I find it to be more so in Asian countries). Yuta (NCT 127), on [Abnormal Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2iTsmeM1Yg&amp;t=49s), addresses this and says that it *is* a problem and that he believes  assigning gender roles can stunt a child's potential.

And please, if it's someone you like/admire, please do not comment under it to prove them wrong or something like that.* 

As the title says, do you dislike a certain idol (or a group) for no apparent reason? If so, who is it? When did you first realize that you didn't like them? 

For me, it'd be Lisa and Jennie from BLACKPINK. I always thought something was off with them but 'til this day, I still don't know what. Although, I hold no grudges against the group. I don't like *them* as Lisa and Jennie but I like them when they are in the group (idk how i can explain this).

I'll try the monthly audition in California once it goes back up again (hopefully it goes back up again...) Anyways!!! I'm a bit spook since I didn't think I was gonna pass the first round.

I have no idea how can someone be so mad at other people just because they like someone else. These fan wars are the basic example of what NOT to do to be a decent human being.

I also really loved Pentagon, their music was 10/10 but after this whole Edawn controversy this fandom started hating on Hyuna so much. This is such a childish behaviour. I love Hyuna, her music is amazing and she is THE queen. Just because she got the man you cannot even dream of, doesnt mean you can hate on her  (I know it was more complicated but most people were just jealous)

These dance moves feels special/powerful compared to normal synchronised moves.

Here are some popular examples:

1. This part in [BTS - DNA](https://youtu.be/MBdVXkSdhwU?t=180), where all 7 members do this cool hand locking dance move.
2. This move in [Red Velvet - Automatic](https://youtu.be/px2Q47O0_eE?t=122), all 5 RV members side by side holding hands.
3. Blackpink - [Forever Young](https://youtu.be/89kTb73csYg?t=160), all 4 members holding wrists and swinging.

&amp;#x200B;

I have gotten into the habit recently of setting a few different k-pop songs as my alarm to wake up in the morning, depending on how important it is for me to wake up on time. This week I've been using Ryeowook's Hello, since it doesn't smack me in the face with anything super intense, and it's nice to hear ""hello, good day"" in the morning. Last week I used Yesung's Fly since his vocals nicely creep in and wake me up without *jolting* me awake. However, sometimes I use SHINee's Everybody when I need that intense jolt to make sure I wake up super early, for things like tests or appointments. ~~Plus SHINee yelling for me to wake up helps too.~~  


I was curious to see if anybody else has any favorite songs to use as alarms. I don't want to keep shuffling between the same three or four that I use now and end up resenting them due to associating them with waking up, lol. ",132,1

But apart from that, the term Kpop just means ""popular korean music"". It isnt a specific genre and Kpop songs could range from Hip hop, rnb to generic pop and even rock (sometimes even metal, if the song reaches a specific popularity). I mean isnt hating on Kpop basically hating on a whole countrys popular music? Not every kpop song is a girlgroup/boygroup song, there are bands and solo artists as well, which isnt different from for example american/british/french and whatnot music. And I mean I dont even wanna hate on that booming ""peoplegroup"" business, there are also lots of musical differences between different boy and girlgroups. So why exactly is there so much hate on korean music? Is it because most people associate the term kpop only with cute/bright pop music or is it something else I dont get? 
(sorry for language mistakes, not a native speaker)

Note: I dont know korean music well, but Ive listened into some of it and to me its the same as others countries music, there is good and bad stuff everywhere.  Why does only Korea receive so much hate? ",9,1

Have/are there any songs that have this sort of impact on you when you really didn't expect them to? They don't have to make you cry, maybe they made you really angry or gave you a super shot of energy when you really didn't think they would.",286,1

A few days ago /u/SirBuckeye kindly posted a link to my new feature, the [sales list for K-pop artists on Aoimirai](http://www.aoimirai.net/kpop/index.html?options=11000001111&amp;hidden=true) and I received quite some heat for offering this new feature. I apologize for all fans I offended for not realizing GAON is not accurate on itself, and that it took me time to fix it (took me 2 months to perfect the data gathering and merge with the main system). I also apologize if the updated system is still not perfect, since even GAON yearly have issues. However, the current system is as good as it can get other than having access to GAON internal data.

Anyway, I would like to explain all of [Aoimirai](http://www.aoimirai.net/kpop/) bot systems and how all data on that site is acquired in an attempt to get any question cleared. Again, all data are only as good as the sources (views/likes = Youtube, Followers = vLive, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Sales = Gaon and archieves mostly from MIAK)

**The Bots**

To keep the site updated and all data flowing, Aoimirai employs three bots

**The first (main) bot** runs almost every minute and fetches views and likes for Youtube videos. It cannot be faster because Youtube detects a fast bot and **throttles it**, causing the bot to basically be useless until Youtube re-allows it. The current rate is 30~60 hits per hour. I cannot afford a second IP to circumvent this issue but I have plans on using an old netbook to run as a dedicated updater and therefore double the speed I can update data without getting banned by Youtube)

The bot have a *layered priority list*, with recent videos being updated every 12 hours, then different styles having an allotted time to be updated (to guarantee they are always updated), with these styles being the top videos on *male groups, female groups, male solos, female solos, coed groups* and *videos with high daily views*. Once every priority video allotted time is run (which means not all video of each category might be updated in each 24 hour cycle), the *least updated videos are updated* (which are usually old, low daily view videos). The daily view counter is calculated from the difference of views between two updates, so even videos that are updated each 12 hours, or videos updated each 3 days, have a daily view value. With the current priority system, it takes about 4 days to all videos be updated, while it would normally take only 3 days if there were no priority lists, but it would mean even high demand or daily view videos to take too long to be updated.

This bot also reports problems fetching data, which sometimes means a video were deleted.

**The second bot** is the followers bot, it fetches the number of followers each artist have on *vLive, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter* and *Instagram*. Since it requires more traffic and server time per run, this bot runs each 30 minutes (but fetches all medias) and can also report problems with any attempt. With this rate, it takes a little over a week to update all followers, but that is not a problem because some medias do not report followers in fine detail (Facebook reports, for instance, in round thousands or millions). 

**The third most complex bot**, and newest, composes the sales from each artist based on **GAON monthly** and **GAON yearly**, and you can see a full explanation on the following video (which also shows the other bot center and logs): [Screengrab of GAON bot running with explanations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1d-X6C9NH4)

Contrary to the other bots, this is run manually once each month, when the GAON monthly sales report is released, or every time an update on the bot is done. It deletes all sales data and restarts from January 2011 adding sales for each artist, and each album. You can see the result by listing by artists on the [K-pop Youtube list](http://www.aoimirai.net/kpop/index.html?options=11000001111&amp;hidden=true), opening an artist tab and clicking ""check sales composition"" (as seen at the end of the video above).

For sales prior to 2011, I gathered data from multiple sources ranging from archived MIAK reports, to Wikipedia and Fansites. This data is pre-defined on the artist and doesn't change, so its only added at the end of the full run as a constant.

**The limitations**

As a rule of thumb, **all real sales are higher than displayed for two reasons**. One, GAON monthly displays only the top 100, which means anything that sold less than about 700 copies is not accounted for unless we can get a ""career total"" from GAON (and even when they do release these, they don't break up per album so we won't really know where the difference comes from), second, because we don't have sales since the last full month, **nor the corrected figures since the last YEAR**. Since GAON monthly cannot track (nor reports) changes in the sales (returns, updates, corrections) we need to wait the Yearly report to check those, and only for the top 100 albums. This last detail is the reason why the version I released last week had wrong numbers.

I am sorry that these numbers cannot be more accurate, but to be able to do that, I would need to have direct access to GAON internal numbers, and seeing how inaccurate even the reports we have are, I can't be sure that would fix too much. **GAON's reports are not coming from a centralized database** (like Aoimirai), which shows how bad their organization is: Artists names and Album names can change from report to report, sometimes inside the same report, and they also don't make their mind on how to show western names with hangul names. Sometimes they report an artist sales under the stylized name, others the hangul name, others the western name, others the stylized name and western in parenthesis, its a mess. The bot currently have all the different ways GAON used to address each artist UP TO DATE but I still have to check every report, every month, to see if they didn't change something. Add to this the fact they can change the name of albums between reports and you will find artists that have the same album listed under different names.

Finally, so far Aoimirai does not track **downloaded music**. I plan on having it eventually (it is almost just a small tweak on the third bot) but given the hate I received from discrepancies on the physical sales data because of problems that were never mine to begin with, I wonder if its worth the trouble just to get my head bashed. Regardless, no matter how accurately I process download sales, it will be LESS accurate than physical sales because since GAON only reports, again, the top 100, there will be more musics left out than the number of albums left out, but at least you cannot return digital sales and I suppose (I would like to) there won't be a need to check the yearly sales against the monthly sales composition.

As a side note, To help me detect how GAON changes artists names, I have a full list of every artist to ever feature on a GAON monthly, and I have to say, its huge. Since Aoimirai/kpop is a YOUTUBE focused list, I don't plan on adding them anytime soon, but with time I will check one by one to see if they have enough MV's to justify adding them up. Also, new or small groups that have little views/sales are left out on purpose to reduce the load on the bots. 

Bottom line is: All this work was done by one person, allowing people access to this huge database of videos, artists, followers and sales, for free, with the possibility to download the full database or use API to put a custom list on your site, and all I get is hate and enraged fans pissed that I left out this group or the sales number is slightly wrong (to no fault of my own), so please don't come at me with weapons because all I am doing is providing people with some fun source of data, and I would rather get people who are willing to help make this a even more interesting resource, than another death treat (yes, this is figurative).

Siwon is a flower shop owner, and a woman who looks older than she actually is enters. She complains about her appearence, so Siwon gives a product of sorts and explains that it was found out by a prince that fell or something and became young again. After that, the woman looked the same, but became much younger looking in her older ages. In one of the woman's later birthday parties, she bumps in Siwon, but Siwon also looks the same.

I bought a P2 PIT ticket which included a Hi Touch after the concert. The concert was at The Novo in the LA Live plaza in Downtown Los Angeles. It's not the biggest venue, so it was pretty intimate and made for a really fun concert! Jae's family was there (his mom and his sister at least) and Jae's friend Byron was there (he edits the Jae6 videos). I'm pretty heavily Young K biased so most of my clips are of him; sorry (not sorry) in advanced for those that were expecting more variety in the photos/videos haha. 

### My Spot

I was GA Pit so it actually ended up being pretty close to the stage. I got there about two hours before doors opened (two and a half hours before the concert was set to start) and was towards the very back of the line haha; apparently some people camped out overnight. I don't normally use Snapchat but they had a [pretty cute geofilter](https://i.imgur.com/6sAJuwv.jpg) for the concert! Finally got inside and was [relatively close to the stage](https://i.imgur.com/jcMrMUG.jpg). I debated doing P1 Pit and the prize for that was a photo with DAY6; the Hi Touch was only for P2 (not even P1 got it) and I kinda wanted a Hi Touch experience more than a photo with DAY6 and nine strangers. Opted for the P2 with Hi Touch but will probably do P1 next time just to be even closer to the stage. 

### Concert

Most of the clips I took were short; I wanted to see it all for myself not through a screen so I didn't really film anything for too long. Should just give you a taste of the concert. :)

Jae was chill, said thanks for coming. I made eye contact with Young K and can't remember what happened after that. Dowoon was sweet and said thank you. They were all really nice! Hi Touches are so fast so there's not a lot of opportunity for anything more meaningful, but it was still a nice experience! ",8,1

2403,2018-11-20,2018,11,20,15,9ypdt3,Which Kpop groups do you think will disband in 2019?,RiceKrispyPooHead,1542693905,"So it looks like the average ""age"" of a Kpop group before they disband is 5-7 years, the typical length of their contracts before renewal.  With 2019 coming up, which groups do you think might disband next year and why?

  

My top 3 predictions:  

1. **Girls' Generation** \- Jessica left the group in 2014, and 3 more members decided not renew in 2017. No promotion for the past year. From the vibes I've got from Tiffany's recent interviews the girls are friends but don't seem too close.
2. **B.A.P.** \- Contract renewal is likely coming up in 2019. Their lastest singles have sold about 10x less than when they were at their peak. The group also sued its label a few years ago.
3. **Hello Venus** \- Contract renewal in 2019. No real promotion for 2 years and really low music sales the past few years despite a strong debut.",36,1
2404,2018-11-20,2018,11,20,15,9ypf1o,All the hyped up November songs are busts.,Kpooper123,1542694211,"Alright, I know I will get murder for this, but I think it needs to be said. Twice yes or yes was their worst song. And the only reason why it succeeded was their popularity. I am not a Twice fanboy, but I love kpop and a lot of their songs. Second bullet, BP Jennie's SOLO was terrible, the rap was horrendous and has no flow. The song is unfinished. Only their beat in the chorus was good, but the lyric of the chorus of was jarring. There is also a discontinuation in the middle of the song, where it feels like the song is done. It is extremely cliche, come on it's 2018 can we get over with the Sorry not sorry crap? I am a Blink. Third bullet, the best releases so far for this month has been Not My Type by Gugudan and EXO Don't Mess Up My Tempo. Not My Type was surprising new and has a fresh feel to it. Don't Mess Up My Tempo was also the same. Catchy and fresh. Although the English lyrics was hilarious, but thats an S.M and kpop thing in general. I love general kpop as much as the next person. There is no edgy against the popularity type of feelings here. This is just a neutral point of view. Hoping Red Velvet, MAMAMOO, and EXID comes out with some bops.",1,1

Rose has the most distinguishing vocals out of Blackpink. The nasality of her voice sticks out the most when she gets to sing her lines whereas, while Lisa and Jennie are very talented, their vocals aren't particularly different from the standard. On Kpop the singers who have a unique sound or tone are the ones I'm most into.

Jung Seung-hwan. It's shocking to know he's just 22 years old because the first time I listened to his voice, he sounded older and more experienced. He's incredible. Look for ""The Fool"", it is a excellent ballad.  

U Seung Eun. Amazing vocalist who can truly belt it out and has even released a catchy Kpop track with Kisum called ""Jealousy"". ",4,1

My Predictions for Red Velvet:

1. Either Seulgi's or Wendy's solo debut, hopefully both of them get their Solo debut next year.
2. Next summer Red Velvet's gonna make a comeback with their third full album titled ' The Red 2'. Yes, sequel to the masterpiece known as 'The Red', although this album will have both Red and Velvet tracks.
3. First Billboard Top 200 entry, possibly with 'Really Bad Boy', RV sold nearly enough in the US to chart on BB200 with 'The Perfect Red Velvet' and 'Summer Magic', expect a boost in the sales with their upcoming US tour, I predict Red Velvet to become the third kpop girl group after Girl's Generation-TTS and Blackpink to debut on Billboard 200 album chart.

Either one or all of my predictions might not turn out to be true though.

Please feel free to share your predictions.

2455,2018-11-20,2018,11,20,20,9yrahy,How kpop and this community made me feel like I belonged.,CosbysSleepyTimeTea,1542712702,"Im Korean American. I am male. I am over 30 years old. I was born in Los Angeles and I spent the majority of my life in Glendale, California. During my formative years, I tried to conform to the culture(s) that surrounded me. Glendale is dominated by the Armenian culture. I spent my entire 4 years in the Glendale High School system trying to culturally survive as a Korean man. In the super inclusive culture of Glendale, there was never any room for Korean Culture.
  
As detailed above, Korean culture held very little clout when it came to west coast style American culture. I was dominated, domestically, by Armenian culture. Assimilation becomes the name of the game as bullying, isolation, and opposition is everywhere. I was a weak teen, and I submitted.

 During all of this, I have befriended amazing human beings of all cultures and realized that, more than not, those people different than you are equally as intrigued by your culture as you are theres.  On top of that, Ive learned, in retrospect, that my friends have learned from me. I am forever grateful and am forever protective of those who accepted me as I was.
 
With all the stupid bullshit stated above, I would like to say that K-pop has always been my eclectic passion that I found that I couldn't connect with anyone. Enter, /r/kpop. I have become so culturally disconnected from it all that Im so glad that this subreddit was willing to give me a window into it all before I gave up: Red Velvet, NCT, Monsta-X, Twice, Blackpink, Fromis_9, BTS, (G)I-DLE, Momoland, IZ*ONE, LOONA, Lee Jin Ah, Gray, Zion-T, Crush,  Heize, and countless more made me realize that I wasn't alone in my passion. I credit this beautiful subreddit. Thanks for giving me an outlet

2491,2018-11-21,2018,11,21,2,9yugpc,"An honest appraisal of the sub in it's current state with regards to BTS and Armys, and suggestions on what can be done.",Daytona-Prototypes,1542736288,"Where should I begin with regards to this sub?

Why don't we start with what is basically an indisputable fact by this point, of which I'm sure that Armys and users of /r/bangtan will agree with me: the moderation staff, for whatever reason, have it out for not only BTS, but also Armys, on an almost unhealthy scale.

Lets start with the mods deciding that for whatever reason,[ Monsta X playing with puppies for Buzzfeed was a worthy addition to the sub, when on the flip side, BTS doing the exact same thing, for the exact same outlet](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/94072o/comment/e3i4avw/?st=JN4KGDM0&amp;sh=981f1afe), is somehow, not in the interests of the sub. I quote the reasoning for the deletion from Dravvie: "" MonstaX isn't as popular as BTS."" This is horseshit. If anything, MX are one of the most popular boy groups out there right now, certainly below the level of BTS, but then again, everything is. But MX is certainly popular. And the long winded, almost hilariously sappy response from Dravvie which basically amounts to 'moderation is hard guys, so stop criticizing me'. Note that nothing is really said about what the actual grievance is about, which is the fact that the moderation is incredibly inconsistent when it comes to groups like MX, and then what is applied to posts revolving around BTS. But as we'll see later onthe moderators of this sub don't exactly have the best idea on what constitutes as fair and balanced moderating.

Now lets take a look at a thread where one of the mods, AnOddName, decides that [no, a post which says that BTS is adding a stadium date to the Love Yourself tour, something that NO KOREAN POP GROUP HAS EVER DONE TOURING THE UNITED STATES, is not needed, and would be ""better suited for /r/bangtan""](https://www.removeddit.com/r/kpop/comments/95rz2y/_/e3v2qjz/). This in of itself is so asinine and so ludicrous a statement to make, especially in an achievement so large, that one wonders how a moderator of all people makes that comment. But as proven later in that thread, AnOddName doubles, and even triples down on his statement, adding that: "" Because it's a bad precedent to set."" What 'bad precedent'?! This is an achievement that is gargantuan by anyone's standard, even BTS'. To say that it will set a bad precedent when it is likely this might be the only time that we see BTS, or any Korean pop group fill a major American stadium, is head-shake worthy. But later on, when he tries to explain his reasoning, by saying that the initial tweet from Powerhouse Live did not mention that it was a new show. By simply using the simple power of deduction, one can easily make the conclusion that yes, this is a new show, tacked onto the end of the American tour for BTS. And sure enough-it was. But apparently, for AnOddName, that was simply too hard. And the cherry on top for this specific example is that he feels the need to act like a smartass and post that his reasoning for the bad precedent was: "" haha i'm joking i just hate bts amirite xD /s"" Even if this was sarcasm, this is childish behavior for any sort of user. To have this come from a moderator is legitimately pathetic, and really calls into the question the integrity of the user. It should also be mentioned that in the very thread listed, a user posted the text from a tweet attributed to a moderator (since deleted) that says: "" 'If I see the word kpoppie in a comment I delete it, I won't allow that BTSpop crap on the sub"" in relation to the Monsta X video above. While yes, the use of BTSpop and Kpoppie is quite cringy and incredibly loaded as a term, the fact that said moderator is deleting them, instead of allowing the downvoting system to do it's job, represents a serious bias for modding. It really doesn't matter if what you are trying to say is a joke, when you have a user with green text, who signifies power and the law in this sub, flippantly making 'jokes' about hating a group in question, deleting posts which really should be left up to the downvotes, and posting absolutely asinine reasoning to defend his shitty actions, it really calls into question his fitness, and his ability to mod without either being flippant and mouthing off. It should be mentioned as well that AnOddName is not alone in this regard. SirBuckeye is also guilty of this, specifically this comment where he posts that Armys are ' pretending you get persecuted (six BTS threads currently on the front page of r/kpop)' when in reality, that Armys are, if not persecuted, are certainly encouraged to by the moderation staff who do nothing but antagonize and unfairly apply the rules to BTS fans. [I should also post this comment as well, but it's much more open for interpretation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9n57q2/love_yourself_answer_bts_has_earned_a_double/e7juivi/?context=8&amp;depth=9).

Finally, we come to the last clear cut example of moderators who seem to be acting within their own interests in making Armys feel unwelcome when they post content of their group onto the mother sub: [tuckyd, and the saga of BTS getting on the global cover of TIME magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9n44ak/comment/e7jldmc/?st=JN4KSAKK&amp;sh=b4ee9fe1).[ I'll let the words of my friend herezy speak for themselves in regards to how asinine the requirement of the titles is](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9o6fle/dutch_bts_fans_leave_huge_mess_behind_after_the/e7sgjgo/), and how the mods once more heavy-handedly applied the rules (in this case, a rule which isn't even that set in stone). tuckyd then decides that it is a wonderful idea to try and split hairs when it comes to titles and the date structure, when in reality it's him trying to back track that he did wrong, and trying to make it seem like it is the users trying to attack him for making a mistake, when in reality, it is users trying to get some semblance of a clue of the rules which in this case, are nebulously applied.

There's of course other examples, which while not directly involved in moderation, adds to the consistent feeling that Armys are not welcomed here, and should be shepherded back to /r/bangtan where they belong. But really, these examples posted above seem to be the clearest indication that the moderation itself is also complicit, and indeed, participating in said unwelcoming nature that has been present in the past few months.

So..what should be done? Really, I, alongside many others, have little faith that the moderators have the desire to apply the rules fairly from BTS to say, Red Velvet, TWICE, or NCT. Indeed, I don't have much faith in thinking that you lot will even listen or take these criticisms and evidence of your behavior to heart and reflect on it, and do better. I've been around enough internet forums to know that moderators, while often times doing a hard and thankless job, often times let the power get to their heads, and start to lash out and be lippy when it comes to honest critical looks from the userbase. /r/kpop in the past few months is not alone, but I feel that nevertheless, this post needs to be made.

I have really only three suggestions to make with regards to this sub. The first being that there needs to be an audit of the moderators, either from outside forces, or from yourselves, acting honestly about your conduct as others have outlined in this post. I myself would recommend that AnOddName be removed from the moderation staff, as his inability to moderate without being aggressively snarky and mouthy, saying very poorly thought out 'jokes' and having to backtrack from them, reflects incredibly poorly on the jobs of the moderators here.

The second suggestion, which should be done after the first, but more in likely will be the only actual action you might take from this, if you even do look at this post before you inevitably delete it, either from the thread this was posted on or during the Town Hall, is to publicly apologize to not only the userbase of this sub for the moderators heavy handed action in regards to modding, but also to Armys specifically in the culture of aggression and hostility that not only power users with girl group biases have fostered, but also moderators in their actions with regards to BTS content posted on this sub. The pervading feeling that I get looking at people's posts and feelings on this regard is that a large chunk of what was active posters with BTS flairs have now either left completely for /r/bangtan, or have basically gotten down to upvoting or silently commenting, for fear of being tarred and feathered, either by the users, or more worryingly, by moderators who seem to have a grudge against them.

The final suggestion is that there needs to be honest appraisal by the mods into the rule set that this sub goes by. While I have mainly talked about the heavy handed interpretation of the rules as it relates to BTS, there have been other cases of the moderators applying them in asinine ways, none more notable [then Dravvie deciding that a thread where Park Bom clearly hints that YG killed 2NE1, being deleted and that the thread was 'better suited for the group's subreddit'](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9cvj1p/park_bom_clarifies_that_it_was_not_her_who/). A sub, that I should mention, is by all intensive purposes, dead. Adding that the somebody Bom mentioned 'could be anyone'. This also ties into the next point: that this sub is incredibly weak for content when it comes to stuff that isn't just simply news articles regurgitated from Twitter or news sites. I'm not suggesting that the sub begin to add in frankly useless fluff articles or content, but it could be best for the sub's life that stuff like essays be allowed, instead of simply being shuffled into /r/kpoppers, a sub that, should be mentioned, has been treated as a graveyard for content that the moderators do not like for years, and has a total subscriber count that the mother sub gets at any given moment, and having to sit through the same daily discussion posts which more often then not, are repeated ad nauseum over months. There is also no excuse as to why AllKpop hasn't been banned as a news source. Do the moderators not remember that Johnny Noh, the headmaster of the site, tried to blackmail and essentially tank Ailee's career using revenge porn? That should have been the bottom line in getting this site banned from the sub, at minimum. I do not think a bot that transcribes articles is enough, and I'm sure others agree as well.

Frankly, I am disappointed in the sub's conduct over the past few months. As a lurker for nearly 5 years, I have seen this sub's moderation go down the tubes even more then it already was, and I have seen that due to the moderation staff's inability or reluctance to look inward at itself and see that users, plus themselves, are actively antagonizing against one of the largest and most powerful fandoms in all of Korean pop, that said fandom is leaving in droves, and others as well, retreating to safer confines. However, I have my doubts as to whether or not you, as a moderation staff, have the ability to look inward and accept criticisms, nonetheless actually put the suggestions I made into motion and not simply just delete this thread, or any other post which might be made in the Town Hall.

I leave you all with this comparison I made that is quite fitting considering where /r/kpop is as a sub: imagine that /r/kpop is /r/baseball or /r/hockey, and consider /r/bangtan as a team subreddit. Moderation staff, alongside power users and the general population of the sub, of which I should mention is mostly male and girl group leaning, have been active in trying to make /r/kpop as hostile of a place for Armys as possible by actively slagging on them as much as possible, making broad and often times insulting assumptions about the greater fandom, and actively trying to sabotage the group by downvoting articles on their achievements, which should be celebrated by the wider Korean pop fandom, and by applying nebulous rule sets to BTS articles and users, while letting other groups off scott free in comparison. By that token, is what this sub is doing with regards to BTS any different from a mother sports sub actively deleting and applying nebulous rule sets towards a certain team's fans, actively making them feel unwelcome, and ultimately driving them to their own team subreddit, alongside heightening tension and mistrust between both sides?

If you see it that way, then congratulations, you are currently looking at how BTS is treated on this sub in 2018. This needs to change, from the top down. Unfortunately, I have my doubts on whether the moderators actually care about taking criticisms, nonetheless actually putting into motion anything outlined in this post.",77,1

I know that South Korea is one of the most homogeneous countries in the world, and has a deeply dark history of how it treats the mixed race children of the Korean War, but despite that it has a growing hapa community. We often talk about a lack of diversity in kpop, and I believe hapas are the first step of that and the most important one. Accepting hapas as Koreans means overcoming the blood purity mindset.

It's 2018 yet Korea still hasn't taken this step, and in it's 'global' 'progressive' export kpop it still projects a pureblood image. When I watch shows with idol hapas, I see they are always a joke, they are not treated as Korean, and their worth is treated as their looks. This makes it difficult for me as a half Asian fan.

Do you think this will change any time soon? Are there any instances that stand out to you of half Asian kpop idols being treated unfairly or racistly?",29,1

I understand at the beginning of their debut that they should promote their group as much as possible but at a certain point, you saturate the market.  How many more fans is Blackpink or Twice really going to get in Korea?  It seems like there are a lot of fans that hate other groups because they aren't their favorites but if you had one or two TV appearances together and realize they are all friends, might change a few minds.

If you're wondering about the thread's new format and slightly delayed posting date, please read the [house keeping news](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/85hb07/kpop_monthly_makestar_roundup_march_2018/) for more info.

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**SOYA Mini Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_soya_01/)

* Date Project Ends: November 21, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Soya?

Soya is a soloist signed to GH Entertainment. She initially debuted as part of a co-ed duo *Soya n' sun* under 101 Entertainment. However, the duo only lasted around eight months before she debuted as a soloist. *Soya n' sun* would eventually be disbanded in 2012.

She is the niece of Turbo's Kim Jongkook, and thus was able to get him to feature on her debut track as a soloist, titled ""[  (I Love You Everyday)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kc7hqZVscU).

She eventually left 101 Entertainment in 2014, moving the Urban Works (the home of Produce48's Kim Minju and soloist Kriesha Chu). At Urbran Works, she mostly featured on other artists' albums and didn't seem to have released solo material at this time. She would later leave the label in 2017 and move to GH Entertainment, her current home.

She auditioned for *The Unit* with the song ""Firework"" (I'm assuming the Katy Perry track) though her audition went unaired. She got 6 superboots and moved onto the live rounds, where she would eventually rank #46 before being eliminated.

At GH Ent, she has been releasing a ""SOYA Color Project"" over a period of time culminating in this release, which is Volume 4 of the series. Her most recent comeback was with the song ""[Arist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjCzp_mMkVE)"", off the mini album of the same name.

She has various active SNS pages, which you can access by clicking [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soya_(singer))

[**MiSO 3rd Solo Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_miso_01/)

* Date Project Ends: December 6, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is MiSO?

MiSO is a singer signed to H Brothers Entertainment. While she is currently promoting as a soloist, she is also a member of girl group Girls Girls, where she is the group's rapper.

With Girls Girls, she debuted in 2015 with the single album *Strong Girls,* with the song ""[Girls Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0adMxZeoGQ)"". Their most recent comeback as a group was in 2016 with the single album [*Juicy Secret.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDH68i1m5NM)

She made her solo debut in 2017 with the mini album *MiSO All Access,* with the song *""*[KKPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZdWo1a40Y)*"".* Her most recent comeback was in 2017 with the mini album and accompanying title track ""[Pink Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5RRgsrVT6Y)"".

Girls Girls has various [SNS pages](https://kprofiles.com/girlsgirls-members-profile/) (and member instagrams!) if you'd like to follow them.

[**DIA Special Photobook Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_dia_01/)

* Date Project Ends: December 12, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is DIA?

DIA is pretty well known on the sub due to the sheer fact that so many members have appeared on survival shows including the first season of *Produce 101* (in which member Chaeyeon made it in IOI) and *The Unit* (in which member Yebin made it in uni.T). So if you'd like to know more about the group, you can check out their [wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIA_(band))

[**VERMUDA Comeback Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_vermuda_01/)

* Date Project Ends: December 13, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is VERMUDA?

Vermuda is a (currently) four member boy group from Triple J Company. The group initially debuted as a five member group on June 13, 2017 under Pacemaker Entertainment with the single ""[Dream Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DAs8FRI2yU)"" off their single album ""Triangle"". However, soon after their debut, original member Je1 left the group and the group would later leave Pacemaker Ent, resigning with Triple J.

During the promotion of this Makestar, Triple J announced that Je1 would be replaced by a Japanese member named Junon. While he has yet to officially debut with the group, Junon has appeared on the group's various SNS accounts, and this upcoming comeback will be his first as a member of Vermuda.

The group's fanclub name is ""Triangle"", which is part of the pun based on the group's name, as together they are ""Vermuda Triangle"".

Not too much else is known about the group in English outside of general idol stats, but a few interesting tidbits about the members:

* Choi Seon debuted as a member of Mr.Slam in 2012 under the name Tae Sun, with the group disbanding that same year.
* Na Kang debuted as a member of ZPZG under the name N.K in 2014, with the group disbanding in 2016. He is also Highlight/BEAST's Kikwang's cousin.
* U debuted as a member of 100% under the name Changbum, leaving the group in 2016.

[**L.A.U Special Repackage Album**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_lau_02/)

* Date Project Ends: December 18, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is L.A.U?

L.A.U (formerly known as LU:KUS) is a four member group signed to JWK Entertainment. The group initially debuted as a five member group in 2014 under PAN Media after having been shifted from BOX Media a year prior to their debut. The group's name stands for **L**ook **A**t **U**s or **LU:KUS** **A**nd **U**.

The group's fanclub name is ""And U"", which makes their name a cute play on words.

The group's debut song was ""[So Into U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDmJ2oDs4bE)"", and the group had steady comebacks for their first two years of promotions. However the group as a whole left PAN in 2016 after a year of no promotions, with original member Jinwan leaving the group citing personal circumstances. 

The group almost immediately signed to JWK Ent. and soon after began releasing music again - though under a modified group name due to PAN owning the rights to their original name. Their most recent comeback was June 2017 with ""[So Sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fol680Uit6Y)"" as a three member group as member Haewon ( J.One) was completing his military service at the time.

This comeback will be this first as a four member group as Haewon has completed his military service.

&amp;#x200B;

[**NANO Mini Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_nano_01/)

* Date Project Ends: December 21, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Nano?

Nano is a soloist signed to Hidden Sound. Nano originally debuted as a member of HISTORY under his birth name Jaeho. 

With History, he debuted in 2013 with the song ""[Dreamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM5GpSPGk-Y)"", narrated by labelmate IU. The group's final single was ""[Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m03Y0PdDUvA)"", released in 2016. The group was disbanded a year later, citing military enlistment of the members as the reason. While recent news after disbandment noted that all HISTORY members would still have individual contracts with FAVE (the group's label under LOEN), I wasn't able to find whether Hidden Sound is another subsidiary of LOEN or Nano left the label proper.

In any case, Nano seems to have shifted gears musically from rapper to singer/songwriter. Furthermore, the music genre he is pursuing is noted on his Makestar as ""combining vintage senses with acoustic and warm lyrics"".

His first single as a soloist was in February 2018 with the song ""[Forever You and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eruZrRgV2bE)"", with his most recent comeback being in June 2018 with the single ""[Walkin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIERlXEQVKI) (feat. Pry)"".

Also, fun fact, but he and frequent collaborator HSND contributed ""Tonight ()"" to JBJ95's first mini album.

[**The Rose Special Photobook Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose_3/)

* Date Project Ends: December 25, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is The Rose?

The Rose is a 4 male rock band from J&amp;Star Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXcpLWB2eBA)"". According to OneHallyu, the group writes, composes, and arranges their own songs. The groups name is said to come from the idea that there are many different color roses, so the group wants to be like a rose and show off many different musical colors. The fandom name is Black Rose.

The group previously ran [two very successful Makestars](https://www.makestar.co/projects?brandIdx=9) to fund their previous albums, grossing 1305.1% and 618.9% respectively.

The Rose's most recent comeback was earlier this month, with the song ""[She's in the Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfucEdhdo8U)"" off their second mini-album *Dawn*. However, due to recent controversy over the use of SHINee's Jonghyun's personal instagram photos without getting permission caused the MV to be deleted, with J&amp;Star Ent offering an apology for the error.

While I couldnt verify the information, the info section of the groups OH thread says that Doojoon, Jaehyeong, and Hajoon met via busking (they started performing under the name Windfall), and Woosung was offered the chance to join by Doojoon due to hearing about his music skills via a mutual friend. Funnily enough, Woosung was a trainee at J&amp;Star preparing for a solo debut, but brought up the band concept to the labels CEO, and after a successful performance by the 4 members, the CEO signed the remaining 3 and formed The Rose.

[**Camila Regeneration Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_camila_01/)

* Date Project Ends: December 27, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Camila?

Camila is a three member girl group signed to C-C Entertainment.

The group's gimmick is being a group with ""no manager and no agency"", as C-C Ent. was started by group leader Han Choim. The group's name comes from the mythological character from Virgil's *Aeneid.* You can read more about the character's fascinating history by clicking [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_(mythology))

Both Choim and member Yu Been have had industry experience in the past, as both members were former members of LAYSHA, with Yu Been also being a member of the now disbanded 1NB under the name of Jung Yu.

Camila debuted in August 2018 with the song ""[Red Lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atgMIE_NCmM)"", and this project is for their follow up comeback.

2560,2018-11-21,2018,11,21,19,9z2835,181028 NCT 127 Coex Artium Fan Sign,jolaurence,1542797670,"First of all, hello. It's been a long while. A very long while. For those who have no idea who I am a real quick into. Name is u/jolaurence and am known for being The Johnny Stan on here and kinda took off right when Empathy promotions started because Real Life. But after a few months away and maybe yet another mental breakdown over Real Life \[because being an adult sucks\], I'm back in a way. And yes, I did have some NCT interactions during Empathy era but I'll just cover the Johnny parts at the end of this account. Also, there's  repackage happening in just a few days and yet here I am going to tell you all about the Regular fansign I got into almost a month ago. \[And before anyone asks, no I'm not trying for signs because I gotta save up for that solo con if it is happening soon. I'm not missing that. Also, I need money to for when I move in a few months to a new job here in Seoul.\] Anyway, let's get started shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

SM fansigns are always the most rushed fansigns in the world. I bought my albums on the second day of buying and went to the Young Plaza location, which has finally left us and I miss that place so much. I found out I got in to the fansign as I was walking towards SMTOWN, almost started to cry, and then ran to the building to meet up with a friend who was there. \[I told her ""Write a letter"" the moment I saw her and we started to scream.\] Sunday, I left church early and headed over to the Coex to meet up with a few friends who had letters for me to give. By the way, Koreans usually ask for money if they get into the fansigns and drop off letters. I don't do that but I prefer that the letters are given to me from friends of mine who really adore the boys, if that makes sense. I ended up meeting a girl who was visiting from the Philippines who got into the fansign and it was her first ever one. My friends were the ones who met her and then directed her to me so I took her under my wing for the night.  We went to the cafe, checked in and got our tickets, and then went back to meet our friends before heading inside for the night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Real talk: I am a nervous wreck whenever I get into a NCT fansign. There's no calm for me. It's only nerves. Even though this was interaction number 7 with them \[and 8 with Johnny but that's for later\], it still feels like the very first one for me. I sat down in my seat, got out my album, notebook, and water, and started to silently scream in my head. All of the Korean I can speak went away. Yup. I was a goner for this one. There was also no Mark or Haechan since they were in Busan with the Dreamies so there went my tow other saving graces for when I messed up. I'm subtitling this as 'See you again"" which has become a tradition between me and Doyoung whenever I get into a fansign.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, fansign stuff. First up was Taeil. Taeil interactions are usually very short. We never know what to say with each other. I had a letter to give to him from a friend's friend from Argentina. 

&gt;Me: Hello. \[in Korean\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Taeil: Hello \[in Korean\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:  \[puts down letter\] Friend's letter.   
&gt;  
&gt;TL: Oh wow. \[signs album and then gives it back to me\]

As I was getting ready to go to Doyoung he asked me where I was from so I told him in Korean I was from America.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up was Doyoung who recognized me right away. Our tradition still stood as usual.

&gt;Doyoung: Hello \[in Korean\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hello. \[in Korean\] See you again.  
&gt;  
&gt;DY: Yes! \[starts writing my name in Korean\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \[stares\] Ugh. Doyoung.   
&gt;  
&gt;DY: \[looks up after writing my name in Korean and stares\] No.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes.   
&gt;  
&gt;DY: Korean much better than last time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Really? Thank you!   
&gt;  
&gt;DY: Thank you! Bye bye!

&amp;#x200B;

Doyoung had heard me tell Taeil I was from America and he figured that I was able to understand what Taeil was asking. Doyoung also has finally sealed his spot as number 3 in my bias list. 

&amp;#x200B;

After Doyoung was Yuta and this was a hot mess. I'm never a mess with Yuta usually but that day, something changed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yuta: Hello \[in Korean\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hello \[in Korean\] Happy Birthday Na Yuta!  
&gt;  
&gt;Yuta: Thank you! \[signs my album\]

&amp;#x200B;

And then I failed. Hard. I tried asking him about an artist from Japan so he couldn't get it so I was like okay. It's fine. I failed with Yuta for the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

After Yuta was Jaehyun and thankfully I have gotten much better talking to him even though his visuals are next level stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Jaehyun: Hello.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hello. Long time no see.   
&gt;  
&gt;JH: Really?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes. Thank you for reading my comment on Talk to Ennana. My friend helped me translate it.   
&gt;  
&gt;JH: Really? \[side note: you had to write a comment during Talk to Ennana to get into the Episode 500 open studio. My friend and I tried to get in but we didn't get picked. Instead, our comment was read a few days later and there was lots of screaming on my end\] \[writes down my last name and says it\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Actually, that's my last name. \[SM now has you wear labels with your name on it for their fansigns. My last name was written first so that's why he wrote it\]  
&gt;  
&gt;JH: \[embarrassed\] Oh. Sorry. \[says my first name and writes it down\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: But it's okay. My psych teacher used to call me \[my last name\] all the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;JH: Thank you. Bye.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Bye. 

&amp;#x200B;

After Jaehyun was Jungwoo and ugh this sweet precious lamb of mine.

&gt;Jungwoo: Hello. \[in Korean\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hello. \[in Korean\] Jungwoo, good job. \[gives him a thumbs up\]  
&gt;  
&gt;JW: Oh thank you! \[He signs my album all over super cutely and I say thank you informally in Korean and then he hands it back\] Thank you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

On it, he drew himself whiskers and drew some hearts. Then he wrote ""Thank you!"" and ""I miss you!""

&amp;#x200B;

After Jungwoo was Johnny, but he's at the end of this account. His section will be longer. After Johnny was Winwin and ahhhh the line for this boy. Everyone was wishing him happy birthday since the fansign was on his birthday. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Winwin: Hello! \[I seriously can't remember if it was said in English or Korean\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Happy Birthday!  
&gt;  
&gt;WW: Thank you! \[sees the letter I put down from my friend\] Oh. Chinese.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Friend's letter.  
&gt;  
&gt;WW: ????  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: She can read and write it.  
&gt;  
&gt;WW: Oh!!!!! Thank you!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Happy birthday! Bye! 

&amp;#x200B;

After Winwin was Taeyong. Taeyong sealed his spot at number 2 in the group back in March during Empathy promotions when he would look at Seasonies during playback and wave to us. He loves Seasonies so much. He's very, very precious to me. Back in the end of March, I got into the high touch and when I got to him, he thought it was the first time meeting me but I told him he had met me before. A few weeks later at the fansign I got into, he said this to me in English:  Thank you always for the support. It's honestly been very hard for NCT over the last few months. There's lots of...uncertainty going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I digress. Let's get back on topic. Our entire conversation was in English. Every. Single. Word.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Taeyong: \[smiles since he recognizes me\] Hello!   
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hello! See you again!  
&gt;  
&gt;TY: Yes. \[he sees the letter I set down\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: This is from my friend.  
&gt;  
&gt;TY: Oh. \[says the name on the envelope and then almost starts to write it on my album but then he realized\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Your English is really good.  
&gt;  
&gt;TY: No. It isn't.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No, really. It's better. My Korean needs is still bad. Needs work, but teaching English.  
&gt;  
&gt;TY: Oh really? \[looks up at me\] Teach me English please!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I will. Seriously.  
&gt;  
&gt;TY: \[clearly in shock\] You would?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes. Trust me. I'll see you again.  
&gt;  
&gt;TY: Thank you always for supporting us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes. Bye.

&amp;#x200B;

Lee Taeyong everyone. Lee. Tae. Yong. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now, finally, the moment most of you probably have been waiting for: Johnny. But first, some backstory from Empathy era. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the showcase, it was held of White Day so they held an event for us. The event was them waving to us as we left. By fate and luck, I had Johnny at my door. I said hello to him and he was like Long time no see with this look of wonderment on him.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, there was a fansign that I didnt get into. Two of my friends did so I had one of them give him a letter to me. \[Technically one friend was supposed to give it but she literally forgot to give her letter to Taeyong and my letter to Johnny so our other friend saved the day.\] When my friend gave the letter and said I dont know if you remember her, but her name is \[says my name\]. he replied with Oh \[my name\]. Of course I remember her.

&amp;#x200B;

Insert me jumping up and down like a kangaroo when my friend told me as I waited for them after the fansign.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got into the hi touch, I asked him why he always remembers me. His response: I mean, how can I not? In which I responded with an Okay. Explain later.

&amp;#x200B;

This was the later. Almost one month later I was getting my answer.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: \[puts poster on the table\] Hello.  
&gt;  
&gt;Johnny: \[not even looking at the post it\] Hello \[says my name\].  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Were in the middle of a conversation right now. How do you always remember me?  
&gt;  
&gt;JN: \[signs poster\] I mean, how can I not?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: You need to explain more dude.  
&gt;  
&gt;JN: Youre the only \[my name\]  that I know in Korea.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \[hands him letter\] This is from me to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;JN: \[takes letter smiling\] Thank you. And thank you for your support.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Thank you for everything. Bye.

&amp;#x200B;

And so here we were, months later, a little over 180 some days, when we got to talk again.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Johnny: \[sees me and smiles with his whole body and I am sure I did in return as well\] Hello!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hello again!  
&gt;  
&gt;JN: Long time no see!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I know. \[puts down letter\] Sorry it's long.   
&gt;  
&gt;JN: \[looks at my name\] Okay. \[Note: Johnny was spelling a lot of names wrong that day\] I am going to spell this right. \[says first letter of my name\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \[spells my name\] And you better \[spell it right\].   
&gt;  
&gt;\[Johnny signs my name\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I've been following you for 6 years already.  
&gt;  
&gt;JN: \[looks at me\] What???!!!???  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yeah. Since predebut.  
&gt;  
&gt;JN: Oh my god wow. Thank you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No, thank you. I'm so proud of you. Always am, but you know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;JN: \[smiles\] Always nice seeing you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Johnny makes me so, so, so happy and I'm so proud of him. He had a line to wait in for once. A lot of fans were asking for his advice. I'm so thankful for Ennana  because it has helped fans know him better. He's so kind and thoughtful and just a genuinely good guy. He is the nicest soul and deserves the entire moon, world, galaxy. You name it. He deserves so much. I hate how there are still people who see him as nothing when he is probably one of the most talented members in NCT. His English interactions with the fans that day were just so cute and endearing and he just took his time with everyone. He's so...I don't even know how to even explain it in words at time. His debut happening within the first few months of me moving to Korea changed everything for me. It will be 2 years come January since Johnny debuted and since I joined a fandom here in Korea full time. Johnny and I being from the same region in the states might also mean something to me. But still. He deserves everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it. My fansign with 8/10 of NCT 127. Like I said, I won't be going for repackage. I have a solo con to save for. NCT means so much to me. Their job might being an idol but the end of the day, they are humans who have emotions like the rest of us. Over the past year I learned a lot about that. That's why I treasure every moment I have with NCT and when I meet them I hopefully remind them of the human aspect of their job: their dreams are coming true each and every day.

my point is that this post could be a kind of ""refresher"" for those of who have been in the fandom for awhile, but may have forgotten about x scandal or for those of us who are newer &amp; may want to know. haven't seen a post like this, so here we go. i'll go first w my lil bit of history back in time post-rabbit hole discovery ha. 

*- leeteuk (suju) &amp; fatshaming. happened on a radio show w miss a members fei &amp; jia, asking when miss a will come back, w leeteuk saying probably post-dream high - since it was around that time &amp; then he exclaimed, ""suzy needs to lose weight first.""*
now mind you, suzy has always been pretty skinny so there was no need &amp; if you look back at old pics, the only big diff is her face.
*- [hanbin / b.i. (iKon) bullying chanwoo / chan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPcQb1qU0_c) i was a fan of iKon (pre-hanbin fake coming out to his mom &amp; making a joke of the lgtbq community) so seeing this made me feel disgusted that i didn't know this. &amp; if you think ""it's just a joke"" look at chanwoo's face as he grabs his hat. tell me then it's a joke.

2610,2018-11-22,2018,11,22,6,9z7fe3,SM's promotion and planning of their artists in 2018,PM_ME_BOOKS,1542834892,"While nothing massively scandalous or troublesome has gone on, does anyone feel like things have definitely felt a bit strange? In particular there seems to have been a lot delays. I just wanna list a few quick things that have stood out to me:

1) First of all what's happening with **Taeyeon**?  im just gonna c&amp;p a comment i saw in r/snsd last night which broke it down well

&gt; -announcing a debut in japan, holding a japan showcase tour with a japanse single album only available to those attending the showcases, and then doing nothing in japan since. 

&gt; -Releasing an unpromoted korean mini album out of nowhere in the middle of that japan showcase tour.

&gt;-Releasing a station song with less than a weeks notice that had 0 promotion compared to all the other station songs. // ..that station track was so under promoted I didnt even know she had one until I read this comment

&gt;-Now she's holding an Asia tour with unreleased songs

 &gt;-in some cases doing 1 day concerts in a 2.5k venue like in Manila while not holding any in Taiwan (where she had 3 sold out days last year in a 5k venue) or Japan (where she was supposed to have debuted and at least had live viewing available for fans before). 

It was heavily rumoured and almost seemed for sure she was meant to release a full length album this year (her tour with unreleased songs pretty much confirms it), but doesnt look like we're getting that until early 2019 at the very earliest. Whatever the reason for the delay, it doesnt seem too much like to me it has anything to do with Taeyeon herself but with SM management. [She posted a weirdly cryptic story on insta last night:](https://twitter.com/SonexStella/status/1064860748654927872)

&gt;Would there be any person who wants to take it easy when it comes to work they love? My heart is regrettable. Lets not become a foolish lazy person who gets turned over by the speed that doesnt suit the world these days and **at the very least dont put a break to the work Im doing.** To myself and to everyone who knows. 

2) Another SM act that have seemed to be severely delayed with weird stuff going on was **EXO.** If an actual exo-l could pipe in here with specific details that would be great. But I believe they were rumoured to be coming back as early as May? then things seemed set for the summer, then September only for them to comeback back Nov for two weeks of promo. Which tbh isnt weird at all for a group their age, but the lack of variety appearances and promotion for their last main cb before enlistments was weird. Even older acts like BoA and TVXQ went on more shows. 

Then there was that whole uploading the Ooh La La La dance practice but then deleting it and never reuploading. Then theres's Marz ~~the attention seeker~~who's been a pretty prominent foreign producer for SM that's largely worked with EXO - he posted on his instagram story recently that EXO's A&amp;R team were ""trash"" and he was glad his contract was ending with SM next month. 

3) Also is there any news about this sudden **Mnet** boycott and what could have triggered it? Sure their relationship hasnt always been the best but the sudden pulling of all their artists from Mnet related things was weird. 

4) Have they settled with what they intend for **NCT?** Why does everything have 127's concept now? Boss was a good song but I cant say I wasnt disappointed that they didnt use U and the opportunity of a new combo of members to do something different. Also Dream. I know they cant keep doing Chewing Gum like concepts but they were meant to be the unit who did the bright concepts. And with My First and Last it looked like if they continued like that they could be the break out public hit group. But then we got Go? 

Also is it just me or didnt they say 127 was a fixed unit now after 9 members? Did they even announce Jungwoo or was just suddenly there one day? I'm not complaining about him being there but where does it end? For people that actually follow NCT, its been 2 years now, would you say you feel like SM have a firm grasp on their concept and how they want to handle them in the future?

Also are there any other companies with as wildly different promo tactics across groups as SM? Its great that NCT are being as heavily promoted as they should, but its small things like providing dance practices for all releases that are being overlooked. NCT are maybe the only SM act to be promoted to the level you see most other kpop companies doing for their artists. 

5) The last point goes without saying - **the extreme schedule/release clashing**. It'd already been pretty bad the last few years but I've never seen it like it is now and cant see the logic behind it. Just today they released teasers for NCT127, Red Velvet and Key, while they're also in the middle of releasing teasers for their new Station season. All 4 of these releases will be released less than two weeks from each other. EXO are also around the corner too with their December repack. Its not even like Nov is an extremely favourable time to release stuff so why all the rush?

There's more stuff I'm missing like lacklustre BoA promos, bizarre sudden hyper focus on USA promos, no news or hype about their NGG2019 etc -- I dont heavily stan any of these groups so please add in or correct me on stuff I've missed or gotten wrong. Is this a more than unusual year for SM or not? Is it likely there are some strange things happening behind the scenes?",153,1

One of my all-time favorite lines is from K.will's Day 1, when he says ""Out of all the ugly guys, I'm the best looking."" I don't know why, I just find it so cute (and relatable as hell lol...). Another one of my favorites is ""I'm a loser who loves you"" in Pentagon's Shine. Also very relatable.

I also absolutely adore the chorus to Twice's What Is Love. It seems like a lot of people didn't like the song, but it's one of my favorites of this year and out of Twice's discography in general. It's still cutesy, but more mature and sweet. The chorus just sounds so pure, and I love everything about the song. WIL reigns superior, and if it doesn't get SOTY I will riot (jk, I'm not gonna be like those salty people who got mad when Signal won last year). ",44,1

For once, an article about the foreign language boom that is happening now that is not US centric.

Very interesting take on it especially highlighting the fact that anything that was not mostly in English was deemed a One Hit Wonder. I was one of those skeptics that thought the general public interest of Kpop would be a flash in the pan but maybe there will be a little bit of a longevity.

For my fellow UK (and European) Kpop fans, what do you think? Is Kpop about to hit mainstream in Europe?",4,1

(they even performed with [maknae](https://thebdt.wordpress.com/2018/09/11/big-bangs-military-hiatus-made-bearable-with-seungris-new-album/)). While G-Dragon is stationed away from them, I can't help but wonder if he's alright. I hope he's physically and mentally well right now. VIPs know that G-Dragon is actually stronger than he looks, (or at least he was. While we're on this subject, here's a good and nostalgic video to prove that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef13B50W0eU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef13B50W0eU))  but his tours and schedule prior to enlisting must have taken a toll on him.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, after that crazy schedule, and opening his cafe and all that, he went straight to the military.... Was he even mentally prepared???

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just worried about Jiyongie!! But it's a relief he's getting beefed up there. He's chubbier now!

2673,2018-11-22,2018,11,22,16,9zbvri,Moments when the bias wrecker(s) almost won? Or did win?,caralyn7,1542870695,"EXO have always been one of my favorite groups, but up until this summer, I never had a concrete bias list. It's always been Chen first, but I didn't have a real opinion on how much I liked the others. Then, after watching Busted because of my love for Sejeong, I started to really notice Sehun a lot more and now he's my EXO bias wrecker. I swear on my life that Chen's still the ultimate bias of all biases, but Sehun...when he had his verse in Tempo I had to rethink a lot of things. And funnily enough, now I have an actual EXO bias list instead of just Chen &gt; others!

My Lovelyz bias has changed so many times. First it was Kei because she's adorable, then Mijoo because she's so much fun, then Sujeong because I love her voice, and then their appearance on Super Show TV made me love Yein. I suppose Sujeong would be my bias, but I'm gonna cheat and say all four lol. But in a way, all of my Lovelyz bias wreckers eventually won their way to a four-way tie. The same goes for Twice, because while I started off as a Mina bias, I went through phases where my bias was Jihyo, then Nayeon, and now I'd officially say my bias is Nayeon when it's really more Nayeon and Mina both.

The biggest upset came from (G)-Idle. At first I didn't get all the hype around Soyeon and thought she was pretty mediocre. I biased Miyeon and Minnie in Latata and Hann, and when the Wow Thing lineup was announced I was so confused as to why Soyeon would be there when she's not as strong of a dancer as the other three. Then the actual song came out, and as a huge Chungha fan, I only really watched for her. But instead, Soyeon stole the show for me. To put it simply, she's just really goddamn cool, and she's way more than a Hyuna wannabe as I'd mistakenly first thought. Soyeon jumped straight from around the bottom of the bias list to the top, and now I know to never judge from the first impression again.

So let's be real: How often do your initial biases end up staying that way, or does a bias wrecker eventually become the bias? Have you ever felt extremely tempted to change biases? And what's your biggest bias upset?",32,1

2694,2018-11-22,2018,11,22,18,9zctfk,181122 GA EXPERIENCE CRUSH ON YOU TORONTO TOUR 2018,OG_etherealbangtan,1542880530,"**CRUSH ON YOU TOUR TORONTO 2018. It is the first North American Concert of Crush in Toronto**

&amp;#x200B;

**PRE-PHASE** ***(PHASE 1)***

* The pre-sale ticket phase was horrible and reminded me flashbacks of how much I struggle at buying tickets and end up resorting in third party ticketing website. I'm not sure why the VIP ticket code was relatively hard to find since it was very lowkey... I didn't even know how people got the code.
* Make sure when going to concerts.... plan your travel 2-3 hours ahead the venue time designated. I cannot stress this enough but weather in Canada sucks and it delayed my subway travel to the venue. Also, this is beneficial when you are new to the place and trying to google map the heck out of the damn phone to find the venue. 
* Make sure to bring basic necessities since the line-up can be unexpected and insane. I did not expect the huge line-up for the concert and you are going to get bored. Try to bring heating pack, water and battery bank. I'm not sure why but my venue requires the desktop version of ticket (pdf). The mobile app doesn't work which is why just print the tickets in case tbh. 

**Waiting Game** ***(Phase 2)***

* I knew I had to wait but I did not expect it would be delayed that much. However, I had to consider that  my experience will be varied since for the DPR concert I got VIP.
* It was too cold outside, I honestly felt the Canadian weather but honestly that day was just insane cold. I couldn't stand 
* I got at the venue in 7:25 due to the delays in transportation. I also was supposed to take advantage of Front Line American Express General Admission but tbh those people who bought that edition same as me still line up ordinarily so i was kinda disappointed

**Entrance** ***(Phase 3)***

* When doing coat check, there are two levels which are the mezzanine and lower level. Make sure to wisely choose since for the venue that I resided. There were guards in the stairs which means you cant go back. I was at lower level before and the advantage would be more intimate and personal connection between the artist. It was just much better in terms of view, however the risks are aggressive pushing from other people. Mezzanine (19+ level) advantage was alcohol drinks, more mature people and more space so one like me becomes less claustrophobic. 

**Performance** ***(Phase 4)***

* There was a DJ that opened for approximately about an hour which is when most people were stuck doing their coat check. 
* Even though i was far away, Crush charisma in his voice is undeniable. The lighting halo/shadow makes him look like an angel and mysterious. He opened with [You and I &amp; A Little Bit](https://youtu.be/QtHaeB69dx8) (correct me on this if I am wrong but I have bad memory that I forgot) (P.S. if someone can ID the second song, it will be greatly appreciated). 
* What is nice about Crush performing is that he has a lot of songs and features in a lot of songs too. He sang some english songs and mostly korean songs. The hype he creates is unbelievable tbh and the fanchants was really loud too ( there were a lot of fanboys and crush noticed them lol). Anyways his personality is a bit shy and cute but tbh when he performs all of that is gone. He turns into a different beast.
* The runs, falsetto and every technique with his voice is just pure eargasm tbh. I did not know how i could survive but I did and I'm so proud. His voice just makes you feel emotionally connected despite not being in english.
* He does these cute and awkward intermissions where he communicates with his fans and ask for any request which song to sing. He also teases the fans a lot which can be seen in [this.](https://youtu.be/Txm78ZqUhck)
* Let me just tell you that when he does Beautiful OST and  just his vocals purely. It was the most beautiful thing I experienced in humanity and existence. My jaw literally dropped rewatching the video bc damn like how many cd's does he eat.

**Ending** *(Phase 5)*

* He did two encore songs and basically ended with his newest english song ""Lay me down"". I thought I would not be that emotional listening to it live but damn...the feels...every song he sang was just amazing and I couldn't have enough words to describe it.

This song has a special place in my heart because it came out at a time where I really needed it. The lyrics are just so inspiring and the MV is beautiful as well. My favorite part of the song is in the end when she says, ""I had difficult times, but followed a small light"". I remember when this song first came out I would listen to it every single day when I would walk home from school. 

**Song Jieun-Twenty Five** 

As a 20-year-old girl, this song just makes me feel like a sexy badass woman lol. And, yes I will definitely listen to this song when I turn 25. 

**IU-Twenty Three**

 I'm at a point in my life where I have no idea what I want. I want one thing today but another thing tomorrow and this song perfectly explains what I'm feeling at the moment. 

**Miss A- I Don't Need A Man**

Another song that makes me feel like a badass woman. I really love the message of the song as well.

(P. S.: If the mods think this post breaks any rules, please tell me and I'll remove it ASAP. Thank you in advance!)

What was your favorite concept (at least for now, considering how this year isn't quite over yet) that any girl group had this year?

My favourite concepts this year were April's Oh! My Mistake and IZ*ONE's La Vie En Rose. Oh! My Mistake was an amazing song with a really nice concept, and it was even better than The Blue Bird (imo) which was one of my favorite 2018 releases anyway, so that's honestly really nice. And La Vie En Rose was the song I was waiting for this entire year, honestly. It was an amazing debut in my opinion, it was classy, elegant and all around a gem, in my opinion. (My good ol' biased heart is screaming 'YENA'S RAP!!!! I honestly adore her.) One concept that I'm really looking forward to, though, is RBB, especially with the Running Man song + choreo spoiler + the audio teaser we got (it was from MCountdown, iirc?).

What about you? What's a girl group concept you loved this year? Also, are you looking forward to any upcoming one? If so, which one? Anyway, have a nice day! ",11,1

So tell me, what type of group do you listen to more but have also branched out to certain songs/groups etc on the other side? And if you would like to list your bias that would be cool too! 

I don't really care for AOA ever since my bias Choa left but Like A Cat is such a jam I love it so much

I dislike Loona, but I absolutely love love4eva by YYXY 

I actively listen to more than one Red Velvet song but in my opinion their songs are hit or miss. I like Bad Boy and Power Up and a few others that I may even consider getting the albums to (my bias is Wendy)

I actively listen to more than one TWICE song as well, and as stated for RV their songs are also a hit or miss for me as well. I like What Is Love? Knock Knock and a few more (one of my most favorite kpop songs overall, and my bias is Momo)

I am actually actively getting into Dreamcatcher because their songs are incredibly unique compared to most girl group music. I love the rock style and I absolutely live for Chase me, Goodnight and You and I and am certainly considering buying their albums.

I actively stan and like F(x), Black Pink and 2NE1 so basically most of their songs and my bias is Amber, Black Pink is Lisa and in 2NE1 is Minzy

Lastly GFRIEND is my favorite girl group and I have 3 of their albums. Rough, Water Flower, Navillera, Fingertip are just a few of the many songs I like by them. My bias is Yerin, Umji and Eunha. 

Honorable mentions:

MISS A Good Girl Bad Girl

Girls Day Female President 

Oh My Girl Liar Liar (I hate high pitched cutesy songs but this song stole my heart)

Orange Caramel Catallena

Now that might make you go ""wait that's a lot so you do like some girl groups"" correct, but Im still a boy group stan and actively look for new boy groups to get into and always get excited for a new one to debut (stan ATEEZ btw) and I could name pretty much any boy group whereas for girl groups I dont really go out of my way to listen to new girl group music and I really only hear the new songs on either inkigayo or youtube kpop list or game videos

So yeah would love to hear your guys's answers!

Obviously every group should have a vocal line, but should every group have a  key rapper or dancer? Should the rapper be an ""actual"" rapper, and not just a member given a rap part for the sake of line distribution? Should the group have a solid leader, co-leaders, or no leaders? How big is too big for a group? Is there too small a group? Should a vocal line still be strong in a more hip-hop/rap focused group? Should all the members be good dancers? Should a more vocal-focused group have rappers? How important is performance skill?

With PD101 S4 in the works which trainees do you want to see in the new season?,wanker0077,1543064704,"As most of you probably know, two Produce 101 S1 trainees tried their luck again and joined the third season Produce 48, although not making the final lineup. These were:

* Park Minji - got eliminated after the Group Evaluations in S1. In her return, she managed to join the Position Evaluation but sadly got eliminated again.
* Kim Sihyun - was one of the youngest contestants on the first season, passed the first elimination and was on the Dance Position Evaluation but eliminated. In Produce 48 she proceeded into the concept evaluation and even got the center position in Rumor. But again, she was eliminated.

In addition, in Broduce, some of the trainees actually debuted beforehand the contest and with that boosted his own fame. To mention a few:

* Kim Jonghyun, Hwang Minhyun, Kang Dongho, Choi Minki- 4/5 of the members of NU'EST joined the second season. With Minhyun debuting in Wanna One and the other three's exposure in the show, their fame really blew up in SK and are now very successful.
* Kim Sanggyun - debuted in TOPPDOGG. His rap skills were highly praised and he was able to debut in JBJ. He now redebuted also with ex-JBJ member Takada Kenta as JBJ95
* Ha Sungwoon &amp; Noh Taehyun - are currently part of HOTSHOT. Sungwoon debuted in Wanna One and Taehyun in JBJ.

**TL;DR:** So in the new season next year, which ex-contestants and maybe members of debuted groups do you wanna see?",67,1

&amp;#x200B;

**Event concept:** The Hertz event is essentially a two-hour 'radio show' where the three members sit behind a desk and talk to the audience about a variety of things, but occasionally get up to perform a song (I would say every 15 minutes or so). It's a really small theater and a really intimate chance to interact with the girls. I wouldn't call it a concert. Definitely more of a fan meeting feel. Kind of reminded me of Yoo Hee Yeol's Sketchbook minus Yoo Hee Yeol lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chatroom:** A special password-locked KakaoTalk chatroom was made for the audience. Only people in the audience could join, and it was only going to be open during the two hours of the event. During the event, the audience could use the chatroom to interact with Odd Eye Circle - ask questions, make requests, comment on their performances, etc. The building of one of the major cable providers actually caught fire earlier that day, so anyone with that cellphone service (INCLUDING ME :() couldn't use the chatroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Swag:** Upon entering, everyone traded in their paper tickets for a really cute souvenir one Blockberry Creative made. The girls are animed out with their signature looks! Each person was also given a slogan that read '   ' (trans: Three moons rise. - a lyric from the song ""Loonatic""), and we held them up to surprise them during the last chorus of their ""Loonatic"" performance.

&amp;#x200B;

[The ticket!!!!!!!](https://i.redd.it/nj30kk2c0b021.jpg)

**\*\*THE SHOW\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Radio Show:** 

Odd Eye Circle came out and performed ""Sweet Crazy Love,"" and the audience freaked out half because of the performance and half because KIM LIP IS NO LONGER BLONDE. The chatroom filled up with comments about Kim Lip's new dark brown hair, and during their initial introduction portion, people in the crowd kept shouting compliments about it. (The audience was easily 75% guys between 20 - 35 and a LOT of them seemed to be there for Kim Lip.)

&amp;#x200B;

**First Corner:**

In the first portion, the girls answered fan-submitted advice questions. The funniest one was about how they were a foreign LOONA fan who can't stop eating Korean food because it's so delicious, but the moment they take one bite, they're already putting on weight. The person also said that they worked out a lot, but only to make room for more eating. The writer asked OEC for encouraging words as they tried their best to work out and stay in shape. The audience laughed when OEC revealed the question wasn't actually submitted by an audience member but actually LOONA member Vivi! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Performances:** Jinsoul - a cover of Toy &amp; Younha's ""   "", Choerry - a cover of OOHYO's ""Vineyard"" (Jinsoul said she picked a ballad for her performance because during her trainee days all she usually sang was ballads, which is much different from what ""Singing In The Rain"" might have people believe. She wanted to be able to show a ballad performance for the event.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Second Corner:**

The second corner was called 'My favOriTe', and was a portion dedicated to the girls discussing their favorite things. Jinsoul's favorite genre to listen to is ballads, Kim Lip loves hip-hip/R&amp;B, and Choerry listens to indie - which is why she picked an OOHYO song to sing. Jinsoul's favorite movies are horror movies, Kim Lip loves romantic comedies, and Choerry likes Harry Potter, Marvel, and animated movies. One of the 'favorites' they had to list is the song they wished to play for the fans - Jinsoul picked ""The Carol"" because she loves it and waits for her turn to sing it, Choerry picked ""Love Cherry Motion"" because as her debut solo it means a lot to her, and Kim Lip picked ""Shine"" by Pentagon and mentioned one of the Pentagon members (she said the name too fast so I honestly didn't hear it) is a LOONA fan. Choerry and Kim Lip then got up to dance the point choreography to ""Shine"" together, with a lot of Kim Lip not knowing the dance too well and relying on Choerry for help. It was so cute! Kim Lip also danced a little bit of Yves' ""New"" saying it's a song she enjoys, but laughed a little during it because she does not know the choreography 100% yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Another memorable question they answered was which gifts they'd give to the other two OEC members. Jinsoul wants to give Kim Lip a vitamin and Choerry the ability to not lie because even when she's tired or going through a hard time, she always says that she's fine. Choerry wants to give Jinsoul hair essence and Kim Lip lipstick. When Jinsoul heard this, she wanted to know what color lipstick Choerry would pick out for both of them - Choerry picked red for Kim Lip and a darker red for Jinsoul. When Choerry asked which color lipstick she should wear, someone in the audience shouted ""PURPLE!"" (her signature color), which made everyone laugh and is what was decided to be the Choerry lipstick color. Next, Kim Lip picked to gift Jinsoul a movable chair (so she can act faster) and Choerry the ability to hear her alarm clock. Apparently, Choerry, Heejin, Yeojin, and Vivi are all really bad at waking up with their alarm, but Kim Lip pointed out that Vivi's alarm IS Yeojin, so it's ultimately Yeojin's fault.

&amp;#x200B;

**Performances:** During this portion, they also sang little bits and pieces of songs they enjoyed and songs requested from the audience. I remember Jinsoul singing 2PM's ""My House"" and Kim Lip singing a bit of Park Hyo Shin's ""Snow Flower"" being two of them, but I'm blanking on some of the others.

&amp;#x200B;

[Performing EXO!!!](https://i.redd.it/sq6ykl031b021.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Third Corner:**

The third corner was another section where they went into various questions. During this section, I admittedly started getting sleepy because while I understand an intermediate amount of Korean, it's far from my native language, so listening to fast Korean for an hour and a half already was making me a little groggy. HOWEVER, I do remember that they talked about how their studio could possibly be haunted. A few members have thought they have seen something, and one time, a member reportedly heard a female ghost voice when there was no one around but her. While I forget which questions were asked exactly, I remember Jinsoul and Choerry saying they have similar senses of humor, and Jinsoul and Kim Lip saying they could never possibly share clothes with Vivi because their fashion taste couldn't be more different - Kim Lip cited a 'cowboy'-inspired jacket that Vivi owns with long fringe going down the sleeves that shakes a lot whenever she moves her arms. Jinsoul's fashion is much more simple and plain, while Kim Lip says she prefers hip-hop inspired girl crush fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Performances:** Kim Lip performed Primary (feat. Bumkey)'s ""Love."" Then the group performed EXO's ""My Answer"" and ""Loonatic"" together, as well as the first verse and chorus of each one of their solo songs. Everyone was a little bummed because the sound guy cut off the 'imagine' section of ""Love Cherry Motion"" before moving onto the next song, but it was still a lot of fun!

K-Pop has a way of making me (and I'm sure, you) smile because the music is either just fun to watch or really catch and happy, and the idols and their group members always manage to seem so happy together. 

Or you're EXO and you have to wait through painfully awkward interviews when they ask you to show off your superpowers.

Either way, what are some of your favorites?

You really can't talk about Kpop key changes without mentioning The Chaser by Infinite. Not only is it the most perfect song ever (don't lie when you know it's true), but that dramatic Woohyun entrance where they change the key for the last like, forty seconds is super memorable and makes the song feel even more powerful. Already one of the best choruses in all Kpop, and the key change at the end cements it as a great song.

Another one of my favorites is the transition from verse to choruses in B1A4's A Lie. The first time I heard it the change felt jarring, but now I love it. All hail King Jinyoung, Producer of all Producers.",68,1

3043,2018-11-26,2018,11,26,5,a0bwq7,Build your dream kpop album!,sonamoons,1543176921,"This doesn't sound all that promising, but still.

Basically, build your dream kpop album. What concept(s) would you like to be the main focus in the album? What packaging would you like? How many photocards / goods overall would you like to be included in the album? Also, what style of tracks (basically examples of songs that you would like for the songs on your dream kpop album to be similar to) would you prefer? How many tracks would you like to be included in the album?

For me, I'd be all up for some simple but GOOD, at least quality wise, packaging, Time For The Moon Night and Color*IZ are the examples that come to my mind regarding decent packaging. I would love either the La Vie En Rose concept (oof, my bias is showing), or, you know what, a whole mix. Red Velvet's Perfect Velvet, Dreamcatcher's Escape The Era, WJSN's WJ PLEASE? and IZ*ONE's COLOR*IZ (the rose version) would be in my opinion a very interesting mix. I'd love if there were as many goods as in basically any TWICE album, except there would be a far smaller pool to pick from. 30 photocard choices, at most, instead of 99+.
I would love both retro sounding songs with some futuristic ones as well, WJSN's Babyface + Yubin's Lady are some examples that come to mind. (Lady for retro, Babyface for modern / futuristic, I guess.)

I would love if the album would have around 11 tracks (if they would somehow come together to fork a cool story, that would be AMAZING) , and my picks would be:

1. About Love (by Red Velvet), an intro of sorts
2. Where are you? (by CLC) / Metronome (Weki Meki) / Babyface (WJSN) / Save me, save you (WJSN) would be my preferred choices for the title track.
3. Pick Me (Produce48) / To The Sky (CLC), which would be an amazing cute concept track.
4. Roundabout (Oh My Girl) / Rookie (Red Velvet) - the underrated B-side.
5. Twilight (Oh My Girl) / Crush (Weki Meki), the B-side that would be promoted the most, alongside the title track. 
6. I am (Produce 48) / favOriTe (Loona), jammy B-side that people would kind of prefer instead of the actual title track.
7. Talk Talk (SNSD, IGAB album), I Got Love (Taeyeon), B-side that is better than people think it is.
8. Time For The Moon Night (GFRIEND), powerhouse ballad-ish.
9. Moonlight Melody (Red Velvet) / Jaljayo, Good Night (TWICE), calming ballad.
10. La Vie En Rose (IZ*ONE) / Love Bomb (fromis_9), I think these two could make a really interesting mix, if you were to combine their strengths and manage to achieve a balance.
11. No Way Man (AKB48) / You're In Love, Right? (IZ*ONE) (that track that nearly no one would expect on a typical kpop album.)
+ Bonus Track: 
12. Stand By You (SKE48) - this song gives me all nostalgic vibes and I'm all here for it. 

So, once again, if you were to build your dream kpop album, what would it be like? ",27,1

For Western artists where it is the norm to not constantly release music, this wouldn't be a big issue for them. However, when idols have several releases a year, it becomes a problem. Some big names who are enlisting very soon are Seungri, Onew, and Xiumin. 

Basically, my question is should rookies be encouraged to enlist while they are in training? It would relieve them of having to enlist later on if they become big names. This would also help with groups who have started to gain a lot of popularity. For example, I feel like BTS might have a hard time with Jin and Suga having to enlist in a few years. What are your thoughts on this? ",13,1

3159,2018-11-27,2018,11,27,1,a0knsm,"Fan Account: One BTOB-Filled Week in Seoul (Fan Sign, Inkigayo, Idol Radio, etc.)",girlsnotgray,1543248687,"For the last 7 days, I was in Seoul during the final week of BTOB promotions trying to fit as much BTOB into my schedule as possible, and heres everything that happened over the week! 

First off I cant believe the sheer amount of luck that went into EVERYTHING I experienced this week. I could very well have come to Seoul and gotten into nothing, saw no one, and did nothing related to BTOB, and yet literally everything that couldve worked out did, and Im so lucky and grateful for that. So lets get started! 

###Getting Into a Fansign

As many of you know Id planned to buy a lot of albums to get into a fansign, thinking that the sales periods are always right before the fansign itself so I should be fine since there will be at least one when during the week Im there! WRONG. A fansign was announced for the day before I would leave Seoul, and the sales period ended *right before* I would land in Seoul, making it near impossible for me to go.

I was feeling hopeless until the very last moment when I realized I could message a trusted seller that I frequently buy from who lives in Korea and ask her if she could get albums for me. She said yes! I literally sent her the money as I was on the plane waiting to take off.

When I landed in Seoul on Sunday, a few hours later they announced the results and *I got in!!* I didnt stop shaking for maybe 30 minutes, and luckily I had 5 days to mentally prepare for this experience (hint: all the prep time in the world couldnt have helped me). I picked up the albums from my seller the next day and goddamn I've never been more tired in my life. I way underestimated how fucking big and heavy 62 albums is. 2 whole carry ons. I damn near died taking it back to my place.

###Idol Radio (feat. Running Into Minhyuk!)

On Tuesday, I went to see the live filming of Idol Radio at MBC, which Ilhoon hosts every day. Its free and fans can sit directly outside the studio and look in, but of course on days when there are more popular guests (aka boy groups) its more packed. I went when Baek Ah Yeon and WJSN Yeonjung were the guests. I arrived at the studio around 3pm and met a friend (the show started at 9pm). The front row was on the floor, and this is mostly where fansites sit, and the second row was sitting on an elevated block right behind that, so just as good seats  thats where I sat. The whole area was filled with peoples stuff because in Korea you can just leave your stuff to reserve your spot (and no one will steal your stuff, insane) and people just respect it America cant relate :/ So people would leave to get food, go to class, etc.

I sat there most of the time but stepped away briefly to go to a convenience store as I hadnt eaten yet. As Im walking back, I see two guys coming my way and two girls are trailing behind them with their phones up taking pictures. I figured it was a celebrity but couldnt tell who it was. As they got closer, one of them started to look so familiar and I thought wow that looks like Minhyuk, but why would he be here lol so I ignored it. Then I realized the guy next to him was Daegyeom, their manager who appears in a lot of broadcasts so Melodies know him, and I was like FUCK THAT IS MINHYUK. They were walking directly towards me and I was just STARING. Minhyuk saw me staring and started staring back at me, probably waiting for me to recognize him (Im sure he gets this a lot), and even as he passed me he turned his head and kept looking at me. When I finally came to my senses I smiled and waved real big like an idiot and he smiled sweetly and bowed at me, then turned around and kept walking. I only realized to take a photo a few seconds later. For the record I still have NO idea why he was even there. 

Getting back to my seat I noticed the Melodies there were standing up and chattery so they mustve also seen him walk past, but thankfully no one followed and there was no crowd around him. Btw that was a running theme I saw this whole week, every time I had a close interaction with the boys, Melodies were so respectful and did not crowd them at all. 

Back to Idol Radio, the filming started at night and it wasnt that crowded, mostly Melodies with 10-15 male fans (of the two guests) standing in the back. Ilhoon seemed incredibly tired, which is not surprising, doing a radio show 7 days a week while in the middle of promotions that being said he was still so peppy. Most of the show was the 2 guests performing songs. Ilhoon was adorable interacting with the fans, always smiling and waving at us or dancing and posing for the cameras. 

At the end, he and the 2 guests came up to the window right in front of us. Ilhoon always plays BTOB songs at the end of each show, and this time he played Missing You. I wasnt expecting fanchants but Melodies came through and they were so loud! It was awesome to be in such a tiny, intimate setting doing fanchants with everyone right in front of Ilhoon who was singing and dancing along.

Overall an amazing experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone whos in Korea because its easy, free, happens every weekday, and is a very intimate experience although there is a wait. Even if you're not a Melody, you can still go for the guests who you may be a fan of. Obviously seeing Minhyuk was an incredibly lucky bonus. Shout out to u/browniemelody for letting me know I could do this, and giving me all the details on how!

###20 Space

This part is not a huge deal but just including it to give a shout out to our favorite leader. Thursday was Eunkwangs birthday, and even though hes enlisted, both BTOB and Melodies never shut up about him and this day was no exception. I went to 20 Space, the Cube caf, and sure enough I got a fansite cup sleeve for Eunkwangs birthday!

###Music Bank

Also nothing that huge in this section but just including it for fun lol. On Friday I went to Music Bank waiting for BTOB to exit after their pre-recording. However, they never came out because they ended up just staying in the studio until the live recording, as they were nominated for first place (and they won!!) so unfortunately I didnt see them. But since the area right outside MuBank was so empty and I stayed for a bit, I was able to see Monsta X and SHINees Key up close as they entered the building, which was still awesome! If you get the chance, you should go to MuBank to see idols come in and out up close, its very easy and not that crowded.

###Peniel's Photography Exhibit

It was announced right before I left for Seoul that Peniels exhibit would begin on the Friday of my week there. So after MuBank, I went to the exhibit on its opening day. It was in a really pretty business building with a gallery on the third floor. The exhibit was in a small room and featured Peniels photography of scenery, BTOB members, and his family. He is super talented, and I felt overwhelmed with emotion looking at a lot of the pictures, especially one of Eunkwang on his enlistment day titled Mask On where Eunkwang is smiling brightly and saluting, but in the caption Peniel notes that none of us can really know how he was feeling that day even though he put on a smile. 

I really appreciated that the photos had both Korean and English captions, and you can tell they were written by Peniel because they were so quintessentially him (for instance, in the Eunkwang photo he said that Melodies shouldnt worry because Eunkwang will come back buff as hell lmao). The exhibit also had a message wall, so I left a note for Peniel saying that I flew here from New York and it was definitely worth it, and I cant wait to see more of his work.

##THE FANSIGN

Saturday morning, D-Day was upon me that morning it snowed, the first snow of the season in Korea, and its said you should see your loved ones during the first snow so thats what I did :)  

The fansign hall had auditorium-style seating with a stage in the front and quite a bit of space between the seats and the stage. Minhyuk came out first and the others trailed afterwards, and they made some opening comments including about how happy they were about the MuBank win from the day before. Then the fansign got started! 

I had prepared so much to say to them, but I was so caught up in it all and desperately trying not to forget to give them my gifts, that I complete blanked on what I planned to say to every. Single. Member. But I got them my gifts and had great conversation with them anyway!

I was 60th to go up, and below are my experiences with each member in order  btw all of our interactions were in English.

**MINHYUK**

Minhyuk holds every fans hand the whole time hes signing and is so genuine and sweet. The rumors are true, I cant think of a single more loving and giving person. He asked me my name, was surprised that I came from New York, and I told him I came to see him before he leaves for the army and he was sad about that. Then I gave him my gift, which was a painted and framed vinyl record for the track he composed on the album, Please (*Jebal* in Korean). He was shocked when I told him I painted it, including the song name in Hangul characters, and he loved it so much! He kept saying how good it was and that Im really good and thanking me. He was pointing at it and was like "":o you made this? and this too?"" He was so warm and welcoming, always looking at my sweetly and holding my hand!! Afterwards I found a [fansite photo of him posing and smiling with my gift,](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DswFMAfVYAAIujF.jpg) ofc I didnt see in the moment since I was talking to another member, but seeing that photo made me so happy :')

**CHANGSUB**

This was the shortest encounter since I think Changsub is least comfortable with English, but as soon as I came up he asked me how I am and where Im from. I think he was going to say something about New York but couldnt quite find the words. I told him I really like his hair and he looks like Draco Malfoy, and he was like ahhhh Malfoooyyy!! with the most adorable smile. I gave him his gift which was a painted coffee sleeve (he loves coffee) and he liked it! Changsub is one of my two biases so Im kind of sad I flopped hard and forgot everything I wanted to say to him, but it is what it is lol. He was still adorable!

**HYUNSIK**

This interaction was also short, and Hyunsik is usually pretty reserved when talking to fans so I was not surprised, but I completely forgot what I wanted to say again since hes my other bias and I was so shook seeing him so close. He said he wants to come to New York, and when I gave him his gift (same as Minhyuk, a painted vinyl record for the title track, ""Beautiful Pain,"" that he composed). He asked if I painted it and thanked me. I also thanked him for composing such beautiful music and said I cant wait to hear more of his music. As I was leaving I almost took his gift with me AND he held out his hand to give me a high five and I almost missed it haha, I was a hot mess. Hyunsiks voice is so deep and soothing though, I nearly died. But yeah disappointed in myself for flopping so hard with Hyunsik, I shouldve been less nervous. Goes to show your biases are probably the ones youll be the worst around lmao.

**PENIEL**

I was the most comfortable and least nervous around Peniel, probably because he is American like me but also because hes so chill. He overheard me talking to Hyunsik so he started off asking youre from New York? and how long I was here for, and he was surprised about it only being one week. I also told him I went to his exhibit and he thanked me and asked which photo I liked best. Then I gave him his present, I bought him cereal because a few months ago he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/PenielShin/status/1033604336826298368) asking where he can buy certain cereals in Korea. I bought those ones and he was so happy lmao, it was exactly the reaction I wanted :) Btw that very night, literally a few hours after the fansign, he posted [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqj4xa7nEUm/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=13ehul1yllv2o) on Instagram! I made it!! So glad I could give him some joy through something as simple as cereal :)

**ILHOON**

Apart from Minhyuk, I think Ilhoon is definitely the most welcoming member who always wants to show Melodies affection. This was obvious at Idol Radio but even more at the fansign, he smiled so kindly to everyone and was so friendly and bubbly in fan interactions. When I came up to him, he started off with a surprised Ahhhhh hi!! probably because Im a foreigner. He asked me if New York is cold lol. I told him he should come and he said hes always dreamed of coming! Then I gave him his present, like the rest of composer line it was a painted vinyl record for his song off this album, Friend. His immediate reaction was a surprised face and then he started laughing in the most adorable way and thanking me. He said its like a prize, and then Sungjae butted in and was like platinum platinum! (like a platinum record lol). Ilhoon also doesnt do high fives or hold hands, he gives you a business-like handshake at the end which I think is so precious. As I was leaving he said see you in New York! Also, after the fansign, like with Minhyuk, I found a [fansite photo of Ilhoon holding up my gift](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DswUvrrVsAI0l2V.jpg) which made me so happy. Im so glad he and Minhyuk loved them so much!

**SUNGJAE**

I have to say, Sungjae is fucking handsome. I mean they are all gorgeous in person but Sungjae is ethereal, I dont think Ive ever seen someone so handsome in person. Since he was listening to (and interjecting in) my conversion with Ilhoon he knew I was from New York. He asked how old I am and where in New York, and when I said Manhattan, I said it the American pronunciation like Manha-an, whereas in Korean you would pronounce the Ts. At this point Sungjae and Ilhoon both started chanting Manhattan Manhattan! imitating the way I said it lmao. Sungjae said his sister lives in Manhattan too. Then I gave Sungjae his gift, a hat that says 6ALENCIAGA since Sungjae always wears Balenciaga and is also obsessed with the number 6 (his last name, Yook, means 6). He saw it and went Ahhhh Yooklenciaga! and started laughing and thanked me. As I walked off stage I told Ilhoon and Sungjae to please come to New York and they were like yes we will! 

Also as soon as I walked away, Sungjae grabbed the mic and started saying (in Korean) how hes having to speak so much English, Chinese and Japanese today and saying how proud of himself he is lol. Sungjae will never pass up an opportunity to hype himself up, I love him lmao

**ENDING**

Finally at the end of the fansign, during their final ment, Sungjae said in Korean that many foreign fans have come today, and he specifically shouted out New York. Then he and Ilhoon started repeating Manhattan the way I said it again lmfao. When they were all saying goodbye and walking off stage, the last thing Sungjae said was bye New York! Minhyuk was the very last to leave and he noticed some people had dropped their bookclips on the stage (theyre used to mark which page you want each member to sign) so he ran into the crowd to give them back to people. 

Overall, Im so pleased with how this went even though I totally did not say anything I had planned to say. Im really glad they liked my presents, and I was able to get a laugh or a smile from them! Minhyuk and Ilhoon especially were so damn warm and welcoming, Ill never forget how sweet they are when talking to fans. One thing I regret is since I was so nervous I would only fleetingly look at them, and I never held eye contact with them for more than a second, but I wish I had. Regardless, it was such an amazing experience, and the fact that I saw all these callbacks to my interactions with them afterwards (Minhyuk and Ilhoon fansite pictures, Peniels insta post, Sungjae saying bye to me at the end) was so amazing.

###Inkigayo Pre-Recording

Coming to Korea I didnt expect to be able to go to any music shows because most of them were actually cancelled for this week. However they opened an application for Music Bank on Thursday, which I tried to apply for but I think I didnt do it right because I didnt get to the confirmation screen. I thought oh well, I wasnt expecting to be able to go anyway. However on Friday again they announced application for Inkigayo pre-recording. This time, I went back to my hotel to be totally ready to submit the application at the exact second it opened! After the fansign, I saw that I got in, and then I realized that my flight was at 7pm the next day and Inkigayo prerecording was at 7am that morning. So I had just a few hours to pack all my shit (including 62 albums which IS THE HEAVIEST THING IN THE WORLD). After packing and sleeping for 1 hour, I headed to Inkigayo at 6am when it was still dark out. 

Although there were some foreigners at everything else I want to, Inkigayo was ALL Koreans. Everything was uber-organized and the process was perfected to a T, with people lining up by exact numbers. The Korean Melodies were so sweet in helping me, like when I didnt know my number was being called up (in Korean) theyd point me to go, or when I received the entry number sticker they told me where to put it and what I have to write on the card I was given. I also received broadcast photocards and a Minhyuk lollipop!

While standing outside, Minhyuk walked by the clear doors inside and waved to us for a quick second. When we went in, BTOB came out and performed the song twice. The first time I was a little shaky on the fanchant but got it perfect second time. Between the takes, BTOB were talking to Melodies, asking if weve eaten, etc. Sungjae was laughing at how whenever they do their greeting (3, 4, Born to Beat) Melodies always do it perfectly in sync with them and that we should have our own greeting. He and Ilhoon made up a greeting for Melody on the spot lol. They also went offstage between takes and holy shit, the legends are true, THEY ARE SO FUCKING LOUD. They werent even wearing mics and we could hear them clearly messing around and laughing SO loudly backstage. At one point Ilhoon was practically yelling HAHAHAHA and everyone in the audience started cracking up. These guys they really are as loud and playful off camera as they are on camera.

After the second performance, they went off and the PD said that that was it, so we were all sad but then BTOB came back out to say goodbye to us. I was really overwhelmed with emotion thinking this was the last time Id ever see them.

Then as we were leaving the studio in a line/crowd going towards the building entrance, I was standing next to a door to the side. Suddenly the door opened and literally 2 FEET AWAY from me is Yook Sungjae, towering above me (AGAIN, HE IS FUCKING GORGEOUS). My heart literally dropped. Everyone around me gasped and started freaking out, but like I mentioned earlier no one crowded him and they were super respectful. He just waved to us for a few seconds, and I could see the rest of the members right behind him in the hallway, and I waved to them too. Sungjae looked me right in the eye, I fucking died. Even though I just interacted with him the day before this was so much more shocking, idk how I survived. So THAT was the real last time I saw BTOB, and what a send-off!

###Final Thoughts

The thing that will always stick with me is all my interactions with Minhyuk in this trip. He always, always always went out of his way to show love to Melodies. He was always the first one to come on stage, both at the fansign and performances, and he would talk to us for a while alone before anyone else came on. He was also always the last one to leave, again at Inkigayo too, taking another minute or two to just talk to us alone. That man just has so much love and genuine kindness in his heart. This isnt's surprising, I think most Melodies know that Minhyuk has this personality, but actually experiencing it in person made it so clear to me and I appreciated him so much more. Im so sad to see him enlist soon, and Im glad I was able to meet him one last time. When hes back out, I dont where Ill be in 2 years, but I really hope I can see him again. As for the rest of the members, it was so rewarding to meet them and Ill continue diligently following their activities and hopefully meeting them again one day. Maybe in New York like they kept saying! Its also bittersweet that Eunkwang wasnt here, but BTOB never forgot him once and would talk him all the time throughout promotions, plus it was also nice to be there for his birthday! And I'm so glad they got a win on MuBank for him.

Again Im so grateful for this whole trip, for all the things that worked out literally last minute from the fansign to Peniels exhibit to Inkigayo. Finally, thank you so much to everyone who answered my millions of questions beforehand (u/jolaurence, u/violinblues, u/redkalm, u/cloudburst04, u/tastetherainbeau) and everyone who bought albums from me to help me get into the fansign! The r/kpop community was so helpful in making this trip what it was, thank you for all your supportive words and messages :)",33,1

another unpopular opinion of mine is that i don't really like winner anymore. i used to be a big fan, but ever since really really i can't really (really) like their music anymore. it feels too basic to me.",10,1

This came to my head while watching Blackpink videos, normal Blink thing to do. But this thought occurred to me while looking at fancams and reading comments....

So, everyone knows, Jennie recently released her solo debut titled SOLO and [she won #1 at Inkigayo](https://youtu.be/smimdoBjeAE) which is fine; she worked hard for it. Obviously its her FIRST solo stage so shes very energetic and whatnot but theres something I noticed, and from the comments Im not the only one.

[Jennie doesnt have that same energy with BP.](https://youtu.be/zPujZqQr8Bg)

There are lots of videos online of Jennie being low energy, or lazy, on stage with her bandmates and its so unfair to them because you can tell the other ladies are working their a** off. 

So here is my conspiracy; does Jennie want to be solo instead of with BP?

Obviously Jennie loves her bandmates, theres no doubt, but comparing her effort in group and solo its a big difference. And I know Jennies song is about being single and happy and empowered, but is this also a hint at wanting to be solo? 

Jennie knows YG and Teddy love her. And maybe thats why shes putting in low effort, knowing nothing will happen. Its known that Jennie is known throughout YGE, even since her trainee days. So, is Jennie trying to hint at them, with these high SOLO performances, that shes better solo?

And yes I know the other BP ladies will be getting solos, but Jennies was first....of course. 

Anyways, try not to take too much of this seriously, it was just a fun thought coming from a fellow Blink. I like Jennie, but my BP bias is Lisa lol. 

I just dont want BP to end like 2NE1 did. ",1,1

3190,2018-11-27,2018,11,27,10,a0q07t,Thoughts going into 2019 from a Kpop novice,slugbug92,1543282892,"Disclaimer: I've only been into Kpop for a little over a year, so I apologize if any info is incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

2018 was a pretty exciting year in Kpop. The phenomenon of ""Love Scenario"". BTS' further breakthrough in the competitive American market. Strong physical and digital numbers from Twice. Highly anticipated comebacks from EXO and Blackpink. As the year wraps up there are some thoughts I have going into 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

**SM**

&amp;#x200B;

Exo: With their highly anticipated comeback wrapped up and an upcoming repackage in the works, what does 2019 have in store for Exo? Will they continue with the 1 comeback per year, further explore subunits while other members near military enlistment? Who might be the most likely to end their contract with SM in a few years?

&amp;#x200B;

Nct: Nct 2018 was a mammoth of a project and it seems that it paid off with strong album sales. That was followed up by strong comebacks from Dream and 127. But I wonder what SM's global plan in 2019 will be. Will they keep trying to break into the American market, debut new units in Vietnam and China? Is 127 ever going to stop adding members? 

&amp;#x200B;

Red Velvet: Summer Magic was RV's best selling album up to this point in their career. I'm excited to see if that upward trend will continue and whether they will match BP or even Twice's physical album sales. Could they be the best possibility for a girl group to win AOTY at Mama since SNSD in 2011?

&amp;#x200B;

**YG**

&amp;#x200B;

iKon: Wow, this was a fantastic year from iKon. 3 comebacks, strong digital performance, perhaps SOTY? I actually wasn't into any YG groups until iKon. Now they're near the top of my list! Bucking the trend of boy groups having strong physical album sales but poor digital, iKon impresses me in so many ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blackpink: I really wasn't expecting the success of D4. But holy cow did they make their presence known! Strong album sales for a gg, stellar digitals, and racking up them YouTube views. Are they going to become the next ""global group"" after BTS? Are they going back to the ""YG Dungeon"" after this? Also, will the solo releases from the 3 other members match the success of Solo?

&amp;#x200B;

**JYP**

&amp;#x200B;

GOT7: GOT7 scored their most music show wins on a comeback this year, with 7 for ""Lullaby"". What will 2019 look like now with Stray Kids in the mix? They have continuously had strong physical album sales, but can that translate to digital? Will JB's wish to win a daesang come true?

&amp;#x200B;

Twice: Twice really never sleeps...another great year for Twice with strong performances for ""What is Love?"",""Dance the night away"", and ""Yes or Yes"". Not to mention their first Japanese studio album ""BDZ"". Twice has been a wall of sorts the last few years with astonishing album sales for a girl group and racking up music show wins left and right. Will they continue their time at the top of the girl group market, or will Blackpink or Red Velvet surge in 2019?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this post was kind of dumb thoughts I had about kpop. Thanks for listening!

It seems to be that dating amongst idols has always been and is still a taboo in Korea which most international fans like me still do not understand. However, this becomes more understandable due to the nature of the Kpop market with how companies 'market' their idols to be the perfect boyfriend/girlfriend which leads to some devoted fans. The whole scandal with Hyuna and E'dawn is one of the very few times where  the negative reception in Korea did not faze their relationship and they are even stronger as a power couple. Do you think that their relationship will help change the way dating between idols is perceived in Korea or do you think that it will continue to be seen as a taboo? ",8,1

Of the groups that debuted this year I think they had the biggest hype and impact. I wonder if Stray Kids can fill the void thats been left by 2pm and breakthrough to the Korean general public, we all know they have wide international appeal. I was afraid their music may not appeal to Koreans, but I think if they can keep creative along the lines of iKon, then they should be fine. (G)I-DLE reminds me a lot of Blackpink and I think they could become the closest girl crush rival to Blackpink. 

Some other boy groups I have my eye on:

Golden Child
The Boyz

I was really excited for Golden Childs debut because Im a hardcore Infinite stan, but a year after their debut Ive kind of lost interest :/ Their music seems kind of generic and they havent gotten that signature style like Infinite. The Boyz had a pretty exciting debut imo and I liked their debut song more than most groups. I think they have all the ingredients to become a top tier boy group, but they need songs that sound less generic. Ive watched a lot of their reality shows though and I think they have the personality that will win over hearts.

Honorable mentions:

Astro
SF9 
Pentagon
Kard
Up10tion 

Pentagon actually had a breakthrough this year but with the whole EDawn &amp; Hyuna dating scandal their last comeback couldnt capitalize on the buzz from Shine. If the Korean public can get over it then I think they have a good shot. The other groups have had pretty mediocre years.

Cosmic Girls
Weki Meki 
Pristin 
Lovelyz

I dont particularly have strong feelings about who I think will breakout among these groups. If I had to put my money on it I would probably say Lovelyz. It seems that even former IOI members in Weki Meki and Pristin cant seem to generate the same excitement for those groups, something I worry about for Wanna One with their upcoming disbandment. Cosmic Girls still stand behind the shadow of Monsta X and havent quite been able to establish themselves fully but I think their multi national appeal could work for them.

You can define international in any way you want. What members would you include, what concepts would they have, and would you market them like a typical KPop group? How would you keep their domestic fanbase strong? 

Mine would be a 7-member boy group, made up of 3 Korean members, 1 Chinese member, 1 Japanese member, 1 Thai member, and 1 Kazakh member. At least two of the members would be 100% fluent in English, but the group would mostly be marketed to the greater East Asian audience. 

They would have two main vocalists, a two-person rap line, and one main dancer, with the remaining two being lead vocalists. They will have a lot of focus on choreo, with high-tempo synthpop/hip hop title tracks and self produced b-sides. Their debut mini and future comebacks would have Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Kazakh versions of the title track, but they would mostly promote in Korea. They would alternate between lighter and darker concepts, and they would also have a story associated with each comeback. The group would maintain a high media prescene, with foreign members promoting in their home countries.

This could be a COMPLETE COINCIDENCE but  I mean just thought it was interesting and wanted to share my thoughts! 

Note: I am NOT comparing talent or trying to get into a debate on who is better from a  talent POV etc I am just talking about similarities in terms of their structure so lets not get into any arguments or start fan wars. 

So I remember reading a while back that the guy that started PLEDIS was actually Boas old manager (also Kahi was Boas backup dancer too!) but when Pledis started they had Son Dambi...like SMs solo female artist BoA.

Then Pledis debuted NUEST which is similar structure wise to DBSK (debuted a 5 member boy band group)

Pledis also debuted SEVENTEEN which also structure wise (13 member boy band) is similar to SUPER JUNIOR. 

Slightly off is AFTER SCHOOL was is 5 member girl group vs. SMs THE GRACE CSJH which is 4 (side note:   SM did this group dirty...ugh unforgivable) 

With PRISTIN, NCT, EXO etc it seems to have deviated from structure so looks to be very much earlier when PLEDIS first started out that there was a similar pattern. 

Again just found it interesting especially given that Pledis founder was SM ex employee.

Not to mention, some fans take things to the extreme. I know theyre not hurting anyone but some people literally put their lives on pause for these idols. Some people waste so much money and time. Ive met several people who regret doing so. I know classmates blowing over $300 a month on Merch. Kids failing classes because theyre too focused on kpop.  I mean I guess if theyre happy?

3 years ago I got into kpop, and I've been TVXQ fan since then. but since a year ago when I saw groups like Tara are getting disbanded or Girls' Generation members not renewing their contracts with SM, I started to worry about what would happen when TVXQ disbands as well. I was so worried and scared of them getting disband that eventually it got to the state that I completely stopped following TVXQ and deleted all pics and videos of them that I had in desperate attempt to lose my interest in them. honestly it worked, but around a month ago I came back to kpop and following TVXQ and at first everything was fine but after a week or so I started to feel the same. my fear even doesn't let me to enjoy their activities. all I'm thinking is ""what should I do when TVXQ disbands? when they get disbanded i wouldn't see any video or hear any new songs from them."" and things like this. I know I sound like a delusional crazy fangirl, but I'm not. back then I wished that I grow out of kpop before TVXQ disbandment, and I did. but eventually I came back to kpop. it seems like when you get into kpop there's no way out.

I'm really tired of all of these emotional roller coaster that I was/am through because of loving a kpop group. what should I do people? please help me!

#PRONUNCIATION GUIDE

As we know from the survey, not a ton of us are Korean experts (aigoo~). The wonderful /u/jellyfilled_donut took the time to put together a pronunciation guide for us as she is a native speaker and wants us to not butcher the language as much as we could. Please give her tons of love, we would be nowhere without her!!

Here are jelly's guides to the vowel sounds, and below is the guide to Merry &amp; Happy itself, romanized with emphasized syllables bolded. Italicized words are English words pronounced traditionally (but go ahead and give us alllll those extra syllables in ""kuh ris tu ma seu"").

A change my view thread is fairly straightforward. People comment their positions on anything K-Pop related and others, in their replies express their views on the same topic in an attempt to persuade the original commenter to consider his position partially or entirely.

**The goal of the excercise is to have your mind changed, so go in with that mindset, this is not a thread to endlessly argue that your position is the superior one over all others**. 

For the sake of this excercise really try to understand where the person you're discussing with is coming from, try to really understand their position and don't antagonize them or mischaracterize them, the more diverse the opinions we have in this sub the better. Ideally eave the [Venom](https://youtu.be/5Hf9osiYOMY) outside of this subreddit but more realistically just try to leave it out of this thread for now.

Here's an example of how an exchanage would theoretically go:

**Person 1:** Change My View: VIXX's best title track is without a doubt Shangri-la. The traditional instrumentation and concept are unmatched in their discography.  
**Person 2:** Whilst Shangri-la is good, the driving melody and the high energy in Hyde makes it a perfect pump song and whilst in some contexts Shangri-La might be better, there's no feeling like blasting Hyde and feeling like a badass no matter the situation you're in.  
**Person 3:** Wow I hadn't thought about it that way, you're right that in some contexts Hyde might be better, so whilst overall Shangri-La remains my favorite I can now see why to others could prefer Hyde",16,1

I started collecting albums about a year and a half ago, and Im happy to say Im up to a nice 41 right now. However, with albums comes photocards, and as I buy more albums I find that I do not know what to do with the increasing amount of photocards I get. (Dont get me wrong, the photocard is probably my favorite part of unboxing, but wow those little things take up a lot more space than one would assume.) 

When I first started off collecting albums, I put the albums in empty spaces in my room and put the photocards next to them. This worked really well until my album count started entering the double digits and the empty space in my room become more and more nonexistent. So I bought a bookcase to put my albums in, and it has been fairing pretty well in regards to space. When I bought the bookcase, I had to find a new way to set up my photocards, so I started putting them up between the shelves using strings and clothespins [like this.](https://imgur.com/a/W30G2Zr) However, now as I am getting ready to make another bulk order of albums, I find that I am losing space even there for my photocards.

So I ask you guys, what do you do with your photocards? I would rather not keep them inside a binder where I never see them, and I dont want them to sit inside their albums and never see the light of day again. I would be appreciative if you could let me know of any creative ideas for what I can do with photocard decorations next! 

tl;dr I am running out of space for my photocards and I need new ideas, please give me some

3417,2018-11-29,2018,11,29,10,a1crya,Explain to me their diets.,aequusnox,1543455801,"My girlfriend is REALLY into k-pop so I'm exposed to all of it a decent amount. One of the darker things I have learned about is how much Koreans starve themselves to get these bodies. 

Here's what I don't get. 

All of it.

I'm 26 and I'm not fat. I can eat A LOT OF FOOD without gaining a single pound so long as I keep my exercise up (every day, usually 10-20 miles on bike or 5-10 mile run). My girlfriend can eat more than me while exercising less and maintains a pretty good body. She's told me it's because Asians generally have faster metabolisms than other races.

Ok, you can eat whatever you want so long as you burn it off. The fundamental of any diet is calories in, calories out. Even if Asians do not naturally have faster than average metabolisms (which is probs true, I'm sure my gf didn't research it) it still doesn't make sense why these k-pop stars aren't able to eat loads of food. Don't they dance a ton? That's gotta burn a lot of calories.

So my question is: Am I missing something? Do they not dance as often as is advertised? Are they lying about their diets? Are they intentionally sabotaging their health despite the fact that the laws of thermodynamics states they are allowed to eat significantly larger amounts of food while maintaining the same body and a much healthier complexion? I'm really clueless about anxorexia and this whole topic so forgive me if this seems stupid. ",10,1

&amp;#x200B;

This honestly used to be one of my favorite K-pop dance videos to watch. The choreography is so intricate yet powerful, and they execute it with such precision and attitude. The original version itself is already so good (and has been covered on basically every reality program), but the remix really goes in for the kill.

I feel like a lot of boy groups tend to have really good choreography, but most girl groups would never do anything like this. Not saying that they don't have the ability to, but that their company/choreographer/music doesn't allow them to.",26,1

I dont know what it is with them, but if you say anything about Kpop that is not positive, they will attack you. 

Admittedly, I like to mess around with them and say dumb things like UwU I got pneumonia cause I listened to Kpop or lol I hope BTS gets foot fungus.  They get super offended and start going off on rants about how Kpop stars starve themselves and literally practice till they pass out so therefore I should worship them. 

So heres a question: what do you guys think about kpop fans that are obsessive and annoying?",4,1

Hi all!

So after some discussion in this subreddit, there was a lot of interest in starting a discord server for K-Pop fans who may have been feeling a lil out of sorts in other servers, so I've gone ahead and made it 4 months ago, and it's sitting at 3k members at the moment &amp; I welcome you to join!

 But there are many other categories of kpop activities that ought to be recognized imho.

Categories such as;

&amp;#x200B;

Best hair flip

Best, live performance more choice than MV

Best hair flounce

[SUNMI - Siren MV 0.44](https://youtu.be/TNWMZIf7eSg?t=43)

Best, colored hair

[Sori - TOUCH Music Bank 20180914](https://youtu.be/oGHhu_XACaI)

Best, MV food related prop

[EXID - I Love You MV 0.33](https://youtu.be/SAdmzjsFVQo?t=33)

Most sassy costume

[EuiJin's stripped pants &amp; top,  UNI.T - I mean \[THE SHOW 180925\]](https://youtu.be/Y9NHHsMa_5c)  

group/solist to blame for making 2018 incredible

[Apink - I'm so sick stage mix](https://youtu.be/f1ur25317fI)

Some of mine:

 We Young by NCT Dream is the best pure bubblegum pop, cute concept song a boy group has ever done. Literally everything about it is perfect, even the rapping fits a cutesy concept song and doesnt seem out place.

 Hating on idol rappers just because they were never an underground rapper is dumb. 
Its the same as wrestling fans hating on wrestlers who didnt watch wrestling growing up or wrestle before coming to WWE. Just because someone didnt grow up being passionate about something doesnt mean they cant discover it later on and then also fall in love with it and be good at it. We all have different journeys.
