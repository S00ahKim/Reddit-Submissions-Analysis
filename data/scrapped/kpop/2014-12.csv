Well today Koreaboo posted an ""article"" titled [8 Cringe-worthy Bad Jokes By iKONs Bobby](http://www.koreaboo.com/spotlight/8-cringe-worthy-bad-jokes-ikons-bobby/). The article uses 8 images taken directly from the Tumblr page. Koreaboo does not link to the Tumblr page or give credit in any way. In fact all they say is ""Here are a bunch of hilarious bad-jokes we found.""

I'm very annoyed that Koreaboo stole images made by fans and then used them in an article without crediting back to the original blog at all. But I'm mostly bothered because I'm almost certain they found the Tumblr through /r/kpop. The Bad Joke Bobby Tumblr page is not new, the posts go back more than a year. But Koreaboo just now discovers Bad Joke Bobby only two days after someone directly linked to it in /r/kpop.

I know stealing content is nothing new on the internet, but I'm still pretty annoyed about it. They took the time to steal the images but they couldn't take the time to link back to the original Tumblr page that started it all? Literally all they had to do was add 3 words ""Here are a bunch of hilarious bad-jokes we found **on this Tumblr**.""

EDIT: Well they *almost* fixed it? They added text that says ""Here are a bunch of hilarious 'bad-jokes' we found on this great tumblr page:"" but then they didn't actually link to the page...",41,30

208,2014-12-5,2014,12,5,3,2oa3ep,"Can we discuss the popularity of the ""sexy"" concept among girl groups?",[deleted],1417716674,"Ok guys, hear me out since this is a long post.

There were a couple comments on the most recent hello venus video link (the schoolgirl one) that complained about how everyone on this subreddit was horny males who are jerking off to the sexy music videos/dance practices/whatever that girl groups are putting out recently.

We get it. Even as a heterosexual guy, I am a bit bored with the sexy concepts. Especially this year, it has become very popular. But let's not forget that cute concepts are also selling sex. And to find the kpop stars sexually attractive is not wrong or anything, considering that is LITERALLY WHAT THEY ARE SELLING. And the moderators have mentioned that they deal with over-the-top comments. So that should not even be a discussion. This sub is male-dominated and I don't believe the subreddit's content is an overly false misrepresentation of kpop news/video content/etc. 

But another important thing to understand is WHY the sexy (and cute) concept is so popular amongst girl groups. Viewers complain about the trend of sexy concepts (which is the only complaint I can really address, as the industry is selling sex anyway...), and it is a valid complaint. But the problem is when they compare it to the plethora of boy group concepts that are out. Let's be clear - boy groups have a SIGNIFICANTLY easier time getting popular than girl groups do. Combine that with the oversaturation of girl groups that began around 2010-2011 makes it incredibly hard for a company to try anything new that boy groups would try. A boy group can have a not-so-interesting concept (that isnt cute or sexy) and still sell a shitton. Then they will compare them to other girl groups that have tried something other than sexy/cute. 2NE1 got popular with their concept in 2009, when the market was unsaturated. Orange Caramel already had recognition from After School. Crayon Pop has had one popular song and that is it. Nowadays, it is a significant risk for the companies to try anything other than the tried-and-true sexy and cute concepts for girl groups. 

I don't know how much this will help (or hurt) but hopefully understanding kpop as a business will sort of explain a lot of the actions that occur. And the comments you may see about sexualizing the kpop singers is a clear result of sampling, as reddit (including this sub) is overwhelmingly male. I remember there was a comment on some SHINee video of some girl talking about touching herself, so there is clear evidence that the companies, whether it be to boys or to girls, are selling sex. Nothing wrong with finding them sexually attractive, and to blame a gender for being some heathen creepy fucks while plenty of others schlick it to boy groups is pretty hypocritical.

I hope I don't sound like I'm on too much of a white knight crusade here. Just hope this easily misunderstood sexy phenomenon in kpop recently is dealt with better.",91,21

I mean I love Beast because I really like their personalities, their voices, aswell as their looks, but no homo. Do you think that a male fan of a male group is weird ?

For those who were wondering what G-Dragon was saying, the generous rapper posted up a photo of the lyrics which were written on three pieces of paper.  
*****
The lyrics to G-Dragon's freestyle rap goes: 
  
This is a year-end fishing for pushovers. Bait. Touts snatching them without a hook.  
My record, skill is always (seen) as a lie,  
I'm so sorry but I love you. I just f**k it, it's a quickie.  
It's been a year, MAMA. Because you set such a large table/awards (sang), You hand it out generously so your children don't fight.   
I'm all grown up now so I get full from even watching,  
Just feed the younger ones.  
August 18 of '88. You getting wrinkles trying to copy my fate, is your fate.   
My age is adding two and seven, it's natural.   
I'm the player on stage, so just be a fangirl.   
Show Me The Money? I don't even know how much I have.  
Gold watch and necklace is just cute.   
This year passed and new year is snatching up. I'll share with you. Dragon (yong) Money.  
Here you go, allowance (yong-don).

And Jonghyun wrote a fanaccount (basically)  

**[141205 Translation of Jonghyun's twitter]**   

Hul. I saw Jack Black at the airport... He asked if I was a rock star, and we started chitchatting. He said he was a rock star too... He mentioned his name was Jack... Are you Jack?!? oOo?!?!?! Jack Black!?! School of Rock?! I didn't even expect that... He's having a concert in Korea!!!""    

**BLUE NIGHT RADIO 14 / 12 / 06**

J: Today morning I came back, I was carrying the carrier and standing where when there was a white man. He came up to me and asked if I was a rock star. So I said I wasn't a rock star but just someone who sings, and then he suddenly took off his sunglasses and said that he himself is a rockstar too, and that his name is Jack. So I asked ""Are you Jack?! Jack Black?"" I spoke to him in English.

Their songs are catchier and appeal to men and women as they're more techno pop. While One Direction sound like the beach boys. To say nothing of the fact they're able to dance in contrast to that anglo-saxon boyband.

Another thing that boggles my mind. We had Psy with his huge hit Gangnan Style. Yet, 2pm's Go Crazy basically has the same formula and garners nearly no attention.

Why isn't K-pop bigger?",25,0

DSP did their best to put hm in the limelight and Youngji took care of the rest. I know she's still a rookie but I think she handled things like a champ. ",90,31

My best friend is a Marine who loves kpop and he talks to me about it all the time. I'm his go to guy because his other friends in Okinawa don't really listen to kpop and he can't talk to them about it. Now I don't really listen to kpop either but whenever I talk to him about it I always try my best to make engaging conversation so it doesn't seem like I don't care about what he talking about, because I do. He recently asked me to help him pick his favorite group, f(x) or KARA. But since I don't listen to kpop I don't really know much about the 2 groups he's deciding between. I've watched about 6 music videos for both groups and I've decided that I think f(x)'s music is better, but KARA's choreography is better. I really don't know what else to judge each group by, which is why I made this post. Can someone help point out some more pros and cons for both groups?

TL;DR Friend loves kpop, wants me to help pick his favorite group. I dont know anything about kpop, need help identifying which group is best for my buddy.",7,0

615,2014-12-14,2014,12,14,21,2p99nu,[Story] T-ara's official fanclub QUEEN'S fan meeting - My experience,JV8,1418561312,"Hey guys, I'm back again with another K-pop story! Last time, I shared my experience at the BTS: The Red Bullet concert. If you want to read it, check it out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2jj9h3/story_bts_concert_the_red_bullet_my_experience/)

Anyway, a couple things before I begin. I only found out about this fanmeet concert thing a few days ago so when I booked my tickets I didn't get the best seats. But it's okay I got to go at least haha. The second thing is that I missed the first 20-ish minutes of the concert because I went to the wrong place. The venue was at Sangmyung Art Center, but what I didn't know was that there was 2 different ones. One on the university and one in a random town. I ended up going to the random town and was kinda of annoyed. So I ended up having to take a taxi to the University and made it there about 20 minutes after it began. I'm just gonna assume that they performed a couple songs.

**Intro**

- First off let me say that T-ara is the most consistent group when it comes to really good songs. Even though they aren't my favorite group, I always enjoy every one of their titles tracks no doubt.

- Unlike the BTS Concert, this was more of a fanmeet. There was an MC and a majority of the time (except for the beginning and the end) T-ara talked to the MC and the crowd about random things.

- I'm probably gonna say this about most idols I see in real life, but CAMERAS DON'T DO THESE GIRLS ENOUGH JUSTICE. They are suuuuuuuuper pretty, like no joke. I wish I had a better camera so I could show you all my own pictures, but I'll link you to some pictures other fans are posting on twitter. [LOOK AT THESE](https://twitter.com/search?q=t-ara&amp;src=typd&amp;mode=photos). Damn, the one who looked best to me in person would have to be Jiyeon, Eunjung, or Soyeon. But still, they all look great! If you guys want, I can upload my shitty pictures and post it here, but you aren't missing much haha.

**Venue**

- So the venue was, like I said, at the Sangmyung Univeristy Art Center so I think you can imagine what it looked like. There was an upperdeck and the ground seats. It wasn't big, but wasn't too small. I also liked that the seats didn't make it so that people's cameras in front of you would block your way. That's really fucking annoying lol.

**The Crowd**

- The crowd was mostly made up of guys as most of you assume. There were a good amount of girls however ranging in different ages. I sat next to a couple of screamer girl fans. I wasn't even mad, it was pretty funny actually. They absolutely loved Soyeon hahaha.

- So unlike the BTS concert, people were allowed to take pictures so there were a lot of people with big-ass and high quality cameras. They even brought their laptops out so they can photoshop them and post it on the internet at the venue. At first I was like ""wat"" but then I didn't really mind. 

- During the performing portions of the event, the fanchants were crazy. I wish I knew them by heart because it hyped me up. I was ready to scream my head off but then I remembered ""oh wait I don't even know the fanchant"" and I stopped myself from looking like a retard.

**The event**

- So like I said before, I ended up showing up 20-ish minutes late. I got there when the MC was talking to T-ara about random stuff. My Korean language is pretty limited but I could understand a few things here and there. The first big thing they started to do was the MC got to look into each of the members bags. While I don't remember completely of what had what inside, but the funniest one was Soyeon's bag. Basically, all the members had pretty standard things you'd find in a bag: make-up, diary, selfie-stick (lol),etc.. But Soyeon, fucking Soyeon had make-up, more make-up, and then a bag of chips. Everyone started laughing. I'm pretty sure the MC was teasing her.

- Next, the MC surprised Eunjung and Qri with everyone celebrating their birthdays. Everyone in the crowd was given signs that said ""Happy birthday HamKyu"" in Korean of course. A cake was brought out and everyone held the sign up while we sang Happy Birthday to them. It was really cool and the two members were touched and thanked everyone. Qri really wants to have a birthday party if I understood the Korean correctly lol.

- Next, they started asking questions that people from the audience left them. This is where my limited Korean skillz brings me down :( For a lot of the questions answered I barely knew what was going on. I could understand some stuff, but most of the time I was just watching each member as they would sometimes make cute remarks or gestures. #worth One of the things that I did know what was happening was when Boram had to do the gwiyomi song. She looked so unmotivated to do it that when she did it, she didn't even do the hand motions she just counted with her hands pretty much LOL. So she ended up making the person who asked the question do it for them. It was pretty funny.

- The next thing I remembered was the games they played. On two occasions they brought fans up on stage and played games with fans. You don't know how fucking hard I tried for them to choose me but I had no luck :( Anyway, they gave away their albums (probably signed) to all the participants. One of the games that I remembered was the Posing Game. Each member had brought up a fan. The fan Hyomin brought up went on stage and started crying and had to hide her face by turning around for a good 5 minutes. Hyomin tried to calm her down and hugging her and everything. WHY COULDN'T I BE CHOSEN :'( Anyway, the object of the game was for everyone to correctly pose for whatever song of T-ara's the MC mentioned. It was pretty funny.

- After that, T-ara went back to the changing room to prepare for their last performances. While that was going on, the MC asked a bunch of people from the audience where they were from to come see T-ara. Once again, I tried my best to be called, but no luck once again :( Anyway, from what I could tell, I was the only foreign western person in the crowd other than this Mexican person (not) who the MC called on. Everyone else was from another part of Asia or different parts of Korea such as Daegu, Jeju-do, etc.

- Now for the last 3 performances. The first song that they performed was Cry Cry, which is one of my favorite songs and choreo from them. It was really good and they all looked great. I'm not sure if they were singing live but their was backtrack. It's okay though, I only really cared about them performing. The performance reminded me why I like Cry Cry so much. The next song they performed was Falling You, the ballad. This song was definitely sang live with very little backtrack. It was really good, especially Eunjung and Soyeon's part. It honestly made me really happy when they performed this song because this was one of the first songs I ever heard from them and I still love it to this day. The song they finished off with was Number Nine! Was pretty much expecting this to be the last song since it was probably one of their more successful songs. I LOVED this performance. Everything from the choreo to the singing to the facial expressions were just on point. Jiyeon's part (the one where she does her little dance) fuckin' killed me. Jiyeon pls...

- After that, they said their farewells. It was over, and I was really sad. The concert lasted a little over 2 hours. It was so worth the 15,000 won ($15) I spent. Although their was an encore chant, it didn't happen. But it's okay, the crowd and I were fully satisfied.

**Final thoughts**

- Oh how I wish I could understand Korean. It would've made the already awesome experience ever more awesome no doubt. I probably missed a lot of funny jokes and stuff but I'm fine with having been there to see them live. 

- Through all the talking, you could really see all the members charms. Especially Soyeon and Eunjung. Even though I couldn't understand anything half of the time, you could see how they reacted and talked in certain situations. Damn sometimes it was too damn cute.

- T-ara seems like a really great group. I really wish that the unfortunate bullying scandal (which no one knows the actual truth about) wouldn't have happened. They seriously would be a top top group. They have great songs and great personalities.

- Eunjung and Soyeon's thighs are really DAMN....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway guys, thanks for reading this really long post. Sorry I couldn't really go too far into specifics as I would've liked due to my lack of Korean skillz. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them as I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. I will also edit anything in if I forgot anything.

Also, I am going to MCountdown this Thursday so would you guys like me to make a post about it as well? I'm really stoked to go too because I will finally be able to see Apink, my favorite group (sorry SNSD).

TL;DR - T-ara gg too good 10/10.

Edit: OMG how could I forget this important thing that happened. When T-ara was picking out people from the crowd, they were waving at people. Jiyeon and Soyeon both waved at me! :D Then, Qri was like 10 feet away from me when she went to pick her person. Damn, fanboying to the max right now.

Edit 2: [Here are some pics and videos from the fanmeet (Not mine btw)](http://www.t-araworld.net/2014/12/video-and-pictures-from-t-ara-2nd-fanmeeting.html)

Edit 3: Sorry to all the people who were expecting a fan account from Mcountdown. Looks like it won't happen because I just received an email saying that Mcountdown was cancelled. They didn't even say why. I'm really sad and pissed that I can't see Apink... :(",56,133

Will be updating on the go. My stream just died so I might mix the order from time to time. If there's anything comment for me to fix.

~~Edit: I got confused. If anyone could tell me when Part 1 ends and when Part 2 of the Gayo starts that'd be great. For now I won't divide them~~

~~Edit: I had to go out for a bit. Will be back in 5~~",144,136

I am currently planning on visiting:

* The awesome kpop shops in Myeongdong
* Apgujeong, the neighborhood of entertainment buildings
* SMtown Coexartium? (which I'm still not sure what it is and how long it will be open)
* Maybe a weekly music show recording but I heard it can be hard for foreigners

So through your experiences or knowledge, any other places I should visit? Specifically kpop related because those are harder to google than the typical tourist attractions. 

Also, are people interesting in me writing an experience/guide/review thread of kpop related places to visit in Seoul when I come back for future references?",9,0

It could be as simple as just that one song, or it could be as detailed as a life story.

Did you frequently checking out kpop songs? Were you new to kpop songs? Were you one click away from never checking them out? What's the song that made you their fan?

As for me, it's kind of a crazy ride, so bear with me... My bias is BEAST, as shown with my flair, but I do go through many groups.

TL;DR at the bottom. :)

---

So back at around 2010, I never really listened to kpop. Only the few songs from Big Bang that my cousin introduced to me. It was funny because even before 2010, I kind of disliked Japanese and Korean songs as I thought ""why listen to them when you can't even understand?"" Oh boy, how wrong I was.

Anyway, in 2011, I fell in love with an anime (WHY WATCH A SHOW WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND RIGHT? Okay, well, I had subs, but you can very well remember the translation to a song), Hetalia, which is about personified countries. I was going through the list of characters, and for *some odd reason*, even to this day, I'm not quite sure, but the moment I saw South Korea, he became my favourite character before I even watched the show.

Well, unfortunately, he's banned from the anime because the government thought his character was offensive and didn't properly represent South Korea. Whatever, I still loved the character, even though I *do* question his character and actions a bit.

So being the dedicated person I am, I decided to indulge myself into the Korean culture. Trying out Korean foods, learning the language (I can read and write fluently, but unfortunately there's more to Korean than just that, hah), and of course: listening to kpop.

So my friend and I started to go through all the ultra popular kpop songs to see which ones I liked. Eventually, we ended up at [Boyfriend by Boyfriend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd5GGvWWnzU) and we laughed a bit and liked how innocent it was, but I never really thought much about it.

A week later, I invited her over again and we put her iPhone on the dock to play her songs while we played some games, and Boyfriend came on again and I said, ""Wow you actually got the song?"" ""Yup."" After listening to it a few more times, I actually really liked the song. So I got into Boyfriend for a while. Minwoo was my favourite of them all.

So time skip a few months, I'm not entirely sure how I got there, but I found out about [Insane by BTOB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmuHZa6DQOc) and I absolutely *loved* it, so I went through their other songs and I consistently loved all their songs. Well, since you know my bias is BEAST already, the first funny coincidence is that BTOB and BEAST are under Cube Entertainment. I liked BTOB a lot more than Boyfriend, actually, so I went snooping around for BTOB things.

Well, anyway, by early 2012 around when I first joined Reddit, I quickly subscribed to /r/kpop.

On one particular day, when I couldn't sleep, I decided to google ""sad kpop songs"" and the first stone to loving BEAST, [Fiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAzWT8mRoR0) came up. I only had a small kpop playlist at that time, but Fiction really stood out to me, but I never really went further than listening to the song, and checking another two songs by BEAST that was recommended: [Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZcOOelT9A) and [I Like You Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLWEvtlCm84). I didn't bother watching the MV, as I almost never do. This isn't even close to the end yet.

Remember how I loved BTOB? Well, Changsub was my favourite, so I searched around to see if he had any solo songs. There weren't any really, but I found [Be Alright by BEAST's Yoseob, 4Minute's Jihyun, G.Na, and BTOB's Changsub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3aSsIxwsE). I didn't even realize it was Yoseob until just two weeks ago. It seemed like BEAST was at the back all this time.

Well, through the rest of 2012 until late 2014, I was never really updated with any kpop songs. I checked for BTOB and Ailee, but eventually, I didn't bother to be updated anymore. If they happened to release a new song and it was posted on this subreddit and I see it on my front page, I'd click it. Otherwise, I wouldn't care to check any further.

Now, it brings me to BEAST... Early October, I was waiting in the car for my mom to finish grocery shopping and I was bored, so I went on Reddit with my phone. Not much to check, considering I checked an hour ago. However, I scroll to the bottom and I see [BEAST's 12:30](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2jp0tq/beast_12%EC%8B%9C_30%EB%B6%84_1230/) thread on my front page and I thought about it. 

""Hey, I know BEAST. It's the group who sang Fiction!"" but I still wasn't sure if I should bother watching it, since I never really liked watching MVs and it was just that one song I liked. But I had nothing to do, so why not? The comments were all positive anyway. So I watched it...

*Holy shit.*

I fell in love right there. It was so beautiful. I was also impressed with the guy with the goddamn amazing vocal range, who I later learn is Yoseob, my favourite guy of BEAST.

---

**TL;DR:** Well, there you have it. It was just these little things that brought me here, it was kind of amazing. That strange, unknown reason that South Korea was my favourite character of Hetalia, leading me to give kpop another go; deciding to search for sad kpop songs when I couldn't sleep, learning me to BEAST's Fiction; and finally watching and listening to a kpop MV after hesitating to from the two years of not really caring much. If it weren't for knowing of BEAST prior to 12:30, I probably would have never cared to watch the video, to be honest.

Just these little, tiny things that if I had never brought into my life, I probably would have never *ever,* from the very bottom, liked kpop at all since I was more into the rock genre. Wow.",139,32

It's my very hopeless attempt to trace the entire history of Korean popular music, song by song, essay by essay. It's still rough, but my talented associates Scott Interrante and Tzechar have helped me get it going and will likely help some more.

[The first post, about ""Gee,""](http://www.k-pendium.com/001/) is a decent representation of where we're headed. As you can see, I'll be using everything from Korean history, music theory (including sheet music and audio deconstructions), peers' writing, and subjective insight to do whatever justice to these songs I can. As detailed [here](http://www.k-pendium.com/info/), my goal in pursuing the K-Pendium is to appeal to K-pop fans in a new way, and to get those currently dismissive of K-pop a context in which they can appreciate the objectively great and substantive things it does within a pop framework, contrary to some stereotypes you may have encountered yourself.

I hope you like it! Above all, I'd really appreciate some feedback on everything from the writing, to the format, to the web design, which could use some help (would love your opinion, if you have one, about the big capped italics font, for example. I'm not sure on it). And if you enjoyed, please do consider sharing it, making sure it gets out to other K-pop fans (Sones especially, for this one), friends who hate K-pop, whatever/etc.

Also, above all I'm doing this project to make it easier for me to write more substantive and enthusiastic stuff about K-pop in influential western press outlets (you may have seen my YG and SNSD interviews at Vice, my Pitchfork intro to K-pop, etc). For better or worse, social numbers really do help with that. So if you would like to support both that and the K-Pendium, please consider throwing me a [follow](https://twitter.com/soyrev), or a [reblog](http://kpendium.tumblr.com/). Twitter's also the place where I'm going to keep closest track of requests for songs for the next entries; hopefully will have another up in a couple of weeks.",0,1

EXO very popular within Korea and Globally.  GOT7 predictably popular with so many foreign members.  Surprising WINNER not on the list. but I guess they debuted for a short time.  Also interesting that SNSD was omitted from the Korea list, is 2015 the year another girl group takes the crown?  ",11,17

1135,2014-12-28,2014,12,28,20,2qm1jj,M Countdown Christmas Special- My Experience,lovinggray,1419767186,"I'm not sure if this is the right place or if anyone cares but on Christmas, I had tickets to go to the M Countdown Christmas Special. I bought the tickets through SMTown Travel for $63.

My experience started with the location first. The timing on our tickets said to be there prior to 4:00 p.m. at the CJ E&amp;M Entertainment Center which is near the Digital Media City station in Seoul. So I got there on time. When I went into the lobby there wasn't a single sign telling me where to go and I wandered on the first floor and went up to the second floor trying to figure it out but I couldn't so I asked this guy if he spoke English in Korean. He said no and I just said M Countdown hoping he'd catch my drift but he didn't so I continued to wander and eventually realized I was supposed to go to the basement where the Food Network programming is shot. Down in the basement was the booth for foreigners and it had each of the tour guides for Chinese, Japanese, and English. I got my ticket relatively easily and looked over the goodie bag we received while my friend showed up. I may be a little selfish but the good bag was free TVXQ goodies from their tour to Taipei... which I didn't go to... and whom I wasn't seeing that night so it seemed a little useless?

Once everyone got there, our ""studio tour"" consisted of walking upstairs, our tour guide showing us the lobby area, we went outside to the area where anyone could see into the news programming office, and we went back inside.. tour was over.... Also a bit useless?

Finally we played a game of Rock Paper Scissors in order to see which tour group got to file into the studio first. I think English team was either first or second. I couldn't tell and I just hopped in line like almost everyone else did. They filed us up to the second floor where we proceeded to sit on the ground indian style in rows of two. We sat there for about an hour. While I'm sure there was good reason for us to just be sitting there instead of filing more comfortably into the studio, I don't know what it is but finally we all filed into the studio on the first floor.

The studio itself was broiling inside. There was no air flow at all. I actually had a fairly decent spot to spend the next hour just standing in. I was on the left side of the stage if you looked at it and not too far back but I realized the studio room was actually really tiny and the crowd was maybe 100 people even though it doesn't look like it. I was right next to where the artist come from the back stage and go on stage to film but when the first group came up, Pure Boy, I had no clue we were actually starting. There was no count down or instructions to cheer loudly or anything. I began to realize that it didn't matter if we cheer or not because there is actually a cheer track and a fan chant track layed over it and not a single artist actual sang life. You read me, not a single artist sang live. It was all lipsynched. On top of that, 8 of the performances were pre-recorded and so we didn't get to see the artist fake it anyways. They all came up on the stage and just stood there waving at all of us as spot fillers. It was annoying actually.

The artist that at least danced were Teen Top, Got 7, Lovelies, Shannon, Ju Jong Min, Zest, Big Flo, Joo Young, and Pure Boy. The ones that didn't were Yu Seong Woo, Park Bo Ram, the song that Yu Seong Woo and Park Bo Ram did together, Red Velvet, Roy Kim, BTS, Sunmi with the guy from Got 7, and Clara. But with Clara, while she didn't perform with that song, she actually danced around and did the Gwiyomi song. 

Some other drawbacks were we couldn't even see the Hosts as they were announcing and the Got 7 fan girls were really freaking annoying and pushy as well as at the very end, the artist threw gifts into the crowd, but the problem with it was while I didn't catch one, a guy from Got 7 handed it to me personally. I thought it was cool but then I looked at it and it was a hand warmer that cost about 20 cents. 

I guess some plus sides were the dancing was really cool and while in person I thought some of the costumes were hideous, they actually looked a LOT better on stage with the camera. Also when I re-watched it, the guys in Got 7 looked super fruity but from the crowd when you could see them dancing, it was actually much cooler. 

Essentially, I would never pay for that again. I thought it was a big waste of money. I liked seeing the artist pretty close up, and I really liked being behind the scenes essentially to know how it all works but damn was most of it a complete waste and I'd rather not have my hopes and dreams crushed. I think from now on I will stick to seeing this kind of thing on TV or videos on youtube.",24,32

17. Got7
18. BTS
19. BAP
20. Teen Top

Kinda weird that solo artists were attributed to their groups but I guess that's what GAON also did for the girl group rankings (mainly affected SISTAR). Basically everybody up until place 9 (Infinite) sold a ton of digital records, the lower ranks don't have that huge of a gap between each place (especially from rank 12 to 20).

[**Physical Ranking**](http://gaon.itbob.co.kr/data/board/20141229_cc9a7611e0f84f3a9c4c8dfc79711ee7.jpg)

17. 2PM
18. BtoB
19. WINNER
20. G.O.D

Basically if you're not EXO, Super Junior, Infinite or DBSK (look at those gaps to the next place in the rankings), your physical sales really don't matter all that much.

[**Overall: Physical &amp; Digital**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5_mvoHCIAAtxMm.png)

1. EXO

18. SHINee
19. BAP
20. Teen Top

Overall not really surprising. EXO's absolute dominance in physcial sales (dat fanbase though) is more than enough to safely secure first place. Surprised that WINNER were able to come in 5th place as rookies. Also Got7 seems to be doing fine and are far from a flop (as some knetz have previously said). Also note that some non-idol groups, like Epik High, were somehow excluded from the rankings.

Will be updating as acts are uploaded to youtube. Don't expect the best quality until after the show has finished.


[For official Youtube videos click here, problem is MBC upload random performances, so don't expect all the acts to be there.](https://www.youtube.com/user/MBCentertainment/videos)

Talking points:

* 2014, the highs, the lows.
* Where has Miss A gone?
* Kpop celebs getting snapchat might be the best thing ever.
* [Who will have a wardrobe malfunction this time?](http://youtu.be/kBkro-pXuOM?t=40s)
* Who's going to be the 'next big thing' in Kpop?
* What will be the biggest scandal/drama in 2015?
