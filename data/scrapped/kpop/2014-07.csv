1,2014-7-1,2014,7,1,9,29iqck,Interview with Yang Hyun Suk on Park Bom's scandal.,kpop1991,1404173840,"[ALLKPOP translation](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/06/yang-hyun-suk-releases-a-letter-to-fans-and-the-public-offering-an-explanation-on-park-boms-incident-4-years-ago)

[Original interview in Korean](http://www.yg-life.com/)


**Your feelings about the article as a producer?**

If you combine the training years, then the amount of time I've been with 2NE1 is 9 years.

The 2NE1 members I have watched over for 9 years do not smoke... do not drink much... and seems to me to have never once to gone out to hang out at a club besides for official events.

At least from what I know, that's how it is... and also because I've never heard of rumors of that sort from those around me.

But the Bom that I know to be this way has suddenly become overnight a 'drug smuggler' according to the title of the article.

It's absurd and shocking that I don't know what to start off saying?
Should I be explaining this absurdity? Will that end up making this situation even bigger?

It's true that these did momentarily present a concern.

However, for all the fans of 2NE1, who are currently on their world tour... for the silly and dongseng-like Bom who became a drug smuggler overnight, I thought that I couldn't just sit back and watch.

**What is the truth?**

As fans already know, Park Bom spent a long time in the U.S. before 2NE1 debut, and she has said that there was a time when she dreamed of becoming a soccer player.

However, she directly witnessed a close friend dying during a game, and after that, Bom had spent difficult days as she fell into sorrow and shock that was difficult for her to handle at a young age. After that, she spent several years receiving psychological counseling and treatment and used drugs that were prescribed to her by a famous university hospital in the U.S.

After that incident, Park Bom was no longer able to continue on with soccer, and after changing her dreams to that of becoming a singer, she came to Korea and participated in the YG audition. It's a day I remember clearly.
The reason that I remember Park Bom among the numerous audition contestants is because as soon as I saw her, she had boldly stated, ""If it's not YG, I'm not going to be a singer.""

Although she didn't pass that audition, she came again the year after that and she didn't make it again, but in her third year, she qualified in first place among the thousands that had participated, so I think that is why Park Bom remains clear in my memory.

The reason why I am talking about these seemingly irrelevant matters is that considering that I did not know that she played soccer or about her medical history until her father told me 4 years ago, even though it's been 11 years since I first saw Bom, and that she's never brought this up to her members, it seems clear that this is a painful memory that Bom doesn't want to bring back.

Up until 4 years ago, Bom had been using the medication that she had been formally prescribed by the university hospital in the U.S., but because she could not go to the States due to her busy schedule, in the process of receiving the medication from her mom and grandmother, it had become a problem because it is a medication that is prohibited in Korea.

But luckily, her medical record over the past several years and her prescription from the university hospital were received and submitted during the investigation, so it was an event that was safely and soundly wrapped up with every evidence being provided.

**It's said [the drug] has narcotic properties, did they know of this?**

In common sense, what mother and grandmother would go get their daughter and grandmother narcotics?

Especially in a world like today when most medications need prescriptions, how many people know of what kind of properties a medication has?

Like I mentioned through my appearance on 'Healing Camp' before, I have to carry around a sedative and take it on a daily basis because of my panic attacks, but I am not curious about what properties make up that medication and even if someone told me, I wouldn't understand very well.

In the case of Bom, she only knew that the medication she took in the States was not available in Korea. It doesn't seem she understood that it was a medication that was prohibited in Korea.

After realizing this after the investigation 4 years ago, from what I know, she has been using another medication prescribed by a university hospital in Korea.

Because they've been busy with their world tour, I haven't seen Park Bom in a while either, but I ran into her when I came out of the office to record last night and saw her shed tears throughout the night because of the articles coming out. After seeing her this way, I feel torn that it has come to a situation where I have to explain a past that Bom does not want to reveal.

I want to wrap up my words as I apologize for bringing about worry to many of you. I will greet you again with happy news soon. Thank you.

Edit: I did a lot of researching and it looks like amphetamine can be used to treat depression or anxiety. Adderall can help depression and help people with anxiety to be calm and focus better in situation.

[And also B1A4 is gone from the artists page on their site.](http://kconusa.com/artists/)

No official announcement, and people are quite upset.

Oh KCON...-shakes head-

**Edit:** They posted [this](https://www.facebook.com/kconusa/posts/816174218413809) on facebook at 3am PST, 6 hours after removing them from the lineup.
&gt; 
&gt; Dearest BANAs,
&gt; 
&gt; We were so excited to announce B1A4 for you last Friday, then just this morning we got the news that we could no longer confirm their appearance...
&gt; 
&gt; Right now we are still working to find a solution so that B1A4 can attend, meanwhile we removed them from our official materials because it would be irresponsible to imply they were coming if we weren't sure -- especially as
&gt; tickets go on sale.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to keep you hanging, but we will have news either way later tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; If you were going to buy tickets just for B1A4, however, don't - you might be disappointed.

&gt; Apologies and Fingers Crossed,

&gt; Youngji has been chosen as the new member of KARA!

&gt; On the July 1st episode of MBC Music's 'KARA Project - The Beginning', the 4 out of 7 members of ""Baby KARA"" who made it to the live broadcast gave it their all. After their final live performances, the votes were counted, and Youngji was the one who stood last. 

&gt; After her name was announced, Youngji shed tears as she said, ""To my family, CEO, everyone at DSP Media, program staff, related people, and Baby KARA... and to everyone, I thank you all. I'll do my best. Please cheer us all on.""

&gt; With Nicole and Jiyoung's leave from KARA, the competitive reality show 'KARA Project' went on a search for a new member who would join Seungyeon, Gyuri, and Hara.

&gt; It looks like Youngji's the one! Stay tuned for more info on the new addition to KARA!

""Main dancer"" (Bomi) makes less sense to me. Any time I've seen Apink performing, Bomi's doing exactly the same moves as everyone else in the group, and is often even towards the back or behind other members. I can't recall seeing any other kpop groups that give dance solos or more advanced dance moves to one particular member of the group. Does a member being the ""main dancer"" actually affect the choreography in some way with kpop groups or is the title just a prestige thing?",20,5

Shouldn't be too difficult (no repeating artists and each song was either promoted live, had an mv, or is by SNSD).

Good luck!

Their music exuded a really grown up and subtle sexuality without being obscene. Kind of like old Maroon 5 without any neediness plus Suit and Tie era Justin Timberlake. ",119,24

There are no repeating artists and each song either has an mv or was promoted live.

Also, this one might be a little bit harder.

Good luck! ^^^^^^^sorry ^^^^^^^if ^^^^^^^these ^^^^^^^are ^^^^^^^spammy

edit: already have a perfect score!

should have made it harder ._.

I am looking to make some space, and get some money back for my previous purchases. I made a google doc of all my albums, and marked off what's sealed and what's autographed. There are 15 sealed albums, 30 autographed albums, and 77 open albums.

Google Doc Removed.

If you are interested in something, but don't want to just send money I can put the item on eBay and send you a link.

In general I will keep prices below eBay price, and below Amazon price, and add shipping cost. In general this will be about $9-10 per album that isn't autographed or a special edition.

I have 343 eBay feedback. [Here is my eBay](http://www.ebay.com/usr/d3marc0)
if you want to see it. I'd like to be able to ship internationally, but don't know the logistics to the cheapest (or easiest) way to do it. So if anyone has any tips for that let me know.

Edit: If you post a comment asking on the price of something, I will PM you the price.

Edit2: Prices are now included on the google doc. Please send me your shipping location (zip code, state, country, ect.) when you send me a message. It seems that international shipping is prohibitively expensive for a lot of these albums since they are so heavy due to photobooks. 

As items sell I am removing them from the google doc.

Edit3: Thanks for all the interest everyone. I am going to bed and will be removing the link. If you have a request in already and are still interested please send me another message.",33,35
219,2014-7-5,2014,7,5,5,29upse,[Quiz + Giveaway] Shatteringblue Music KPop Quiz #1,Shatteringblue,1404506483,"Hey /r/Kpop!

I'm going to be jumping on the hype train with everyone making quizzes. 

---

**General Information**:

* The quiz will have 30 clips ranging from 1 second to 12.
* The quiz will have exactly 15 boy groups and 15 girl groups. (Although they may be featuring someone of the opposite gender. **HINT HINT**)
* The quiz will close on **July 6th. 1:30PM PST** Two days from this post.
* I know some of them are really easy and some of them are **VERY HARD**. This is to test the waters and see how people do before I push out the next one with a bbetter prize.
* **No repeating artists**

---

**Rules:**

* You may only enter once
* You may NOT edit your responses
* You may NOT put an answer in the comment section. Doing so will get you banned from future quizzes.
* The winner will be the person with the highest score. If multiple people tie, it will be a drawing through random.org. 
* ***HENCE YOU DON'T NEED TO GET A PERFECT SCORE TO WIN!***

---

**Prizes:**

The prize for the winner will be one of the following (They get to pick):

**2AM** - F.Scott Fitzgerald's Way Of Love: http://i.imgur.com/oT72YUT.jpg

**FTISLAND** - The Return: http://i.imgur.com/t2lBOvo.jpg

Both are brand new and still packaged. I will pay for shipping. If the winner does not want either, s/he can choose to give it to the next person OR to donate it for future quizzes. I will try to keep this bi-weekly (or monthly depending on how busy I am).

***If the winner gets 100%, they get a special bonus. Depending on what I find and my wallet, this could include one or more: kpop magazine, lanyard, rubber wrist band, playing cards, notebooks/postits, etc.***

* If nobody gets 100% and I bought some. I'll distribute it to the people that are the only ones to get a song right.  Otherwise, they're saved for next giveaway
---

**Other:**

I have around 3 or 4 albums left to give away. If you'd like to donate, please **post it below as a comment** so it doesn't look like I am trying to get free albums or something. **I will not ask you to remove them.**

**Please do not cheat. This quiz is for fun!**

The beginning is supposed to be easy. The end has some well known ones too. Answers will be posted when the quiz ends.

---

**Final stuff**

I expect a lot of people to participate and I really do not have the time to look through all of the answers. Hopefully I'll have them posted by night time.

-All outfits were either used in the MV or on stage

Description: ""And July July July! What an amazing July! NINE songs got into the chart and destroyed everyone! The unbeatable AOA's Short Hair who got a PERFECT score 2 weeks ago, got a perfect score AGAIN! (1st place in my chart and 1st place in fan chart!), but will one of the new songs bring it down or was one able to resist their destruction and take AoA's place? Check the chart to find out! (The monthly chart should be coming somewhere in the next 48 hours!)""

How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 3 points to a single song.

**Awards and honorable mentions:**

There were three people that got 100% on this quiz! 

1. /u/imnotlistening
2. /u/tripodeye
3. /u/lineon_

**After running this through random.org, the winner of the Quiz #1 is /u/imnotlistening**! Congratulations! I will PM you the details and questions for the prize and where to send it.

[The answers can be found by clicking here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WR-12IiZoC_qqxMFl2V7y6jC3m6oAhvQFdNeSNUALGI/edit?usp=sharing)

**Important News:** 

* I've received many reports that the quiz was too hard, but many people scored very well (Over 100 responses total!). *Thus, I have decided to change the format of the quizzes.*

* In the future, there will be five categories with 6 songs each. (Still 30 songs total). The categories will range in difficulty from **Easy** (Songs from 2014) to **Impossible** (Good luck. Probably only /u/fiveSeveN_ would get them. And maybe 1-2 others.)

* Getting all of the songs in 1 category will award you with 1 entry to the prize. This will be raffle based. The grand prize for the next quiz is a brand new and sealed: **BIG BANG MINI ALBUM #4!!**  #hype

* Once again, if you manage to get all of the songs right from all 5 categories, I'll throw in some bonuses. *Furthermore, you get 1 additional bonus entry.* (For a total of 6)

* Now, before I make the next quiz (Which will be in 2+ weeks), I need to figure out what's hard and easy.

* **Please fill out this poll. Your responses will directly reflect the difficulty of the next quiz**: [Click Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SjHXmnutlZ5SAhFL9WW53yAlFWPqnB5DiLtADVzYeYA/viewform?usp=send_form)

* **Last part is not necessary. Please don't answer if you don't know the songs. The number scale is to scale how long it takes you to figure it out.**

""Reaction"" Videos and Other Stuff",Manworker,1405039436,"The other day I was just struck with the inspiration and desire to make videos to share my love of K-Pop. I want to share my thoughts and opinions on things and while I think that posting on forums and stuff is great I feel that I am better able to express myself through video. So here I am making it happen with my first video.

---

**What To Expect**

I think that the most popular videos are the Music Video reaction videos. The videos that I see are all people set up in front of a camera watching the video live and giving live commentary on what they are thinking. These videos are valuable and have their place because the raw emotion and feelings that they showcase but I want to go a bit deeper than that. I want to critically watch and listen to a song and pull out some highlights(good or bad) that I would like to share my thoughts on a expand on. I am also shooting for a higher production value but that is just personal preference and does not have much of a bearing on my motivation to do this.  

Album ""Reviews"" as well. These are not going to be unboxing videos, there are tons of these all over the place and it would be difficult for me to get the albums to showcase. Instead I will be taking what I am doing in the ""Reaction"" videos and applying that to an entire album. I am going to have have a serious think about what makes me like a song and what makes me dislike a song. Sure, you can get the songs and judge them yourself but I want to share what I think. In the video I say that my goal is to have give a bit of a review to help you make a decision on whether to buy an album or not. It is true that is what the point is at the very basic level, I also want to get some critical thinking and discussion going.

Do you like K-Dramas? I Love them. I watch just about every series that I can get my hands on. To play off of this interest I will also be doing videos on the various series that I am watching. Episode reactions or reviews, series previews and series wrap-ups are somethings that you can expect in this area. I will only start doing these once I start to get caught back up with what I was watching before the World Cup began so that I am not making videos covering old episodes. I am hoping that doing these videos will make me pay more attention to the shows and I will be able to pull more stuff out of them that I am able to currently. Maybe knowing Korean would help me out as well(something I am working on) HAHA. 

---

Overall I want to explore the thought process behind why I like or dislike things and I want to share my findings. On top of that I want to provoke viewers to take a deeper look at things as well and share their findings with me. I want to hear what the masses think and why!

So please check me out. My [first video](http://youtu.be/uFAaFm-nUKc) is an intro to myself and an outline of what I am trying to do. Please support me well and take care of me! I am going to be putting out my first real content soon, I just need to edit it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYs_GMfCqTI

There have been several comments I have read stating that this MV sends a negative message because it shows that men will love girls that have a nice body and that girls with nice bodies will generally have more fun.

My personal opinion on this is that it is true. It is very true. There is no hiding from that. People that have better aesthetics WILL have an easier time in the social aspect. Everybody wants to look at a girl with a nice body, girls will want to look at a guy who has a nice body. Everybody will be more willing to interact with someone who has pleasing aesthetics as well as showing confidence, which is Hyomin in this video. I don't understand why people take that as a negative.

People are also commenting that it promotes starving yourself to be paper thin so that people will like you...well no...the MV doesn't show that at all...it shows that exercising and being active will give you a nice figure.

As for the message, I don't find it to be a negative one. It shows a rather large girl in the beginning eating lots of junk food and the general atmosphere is pretty dark and leaning towards ""unhappy."" It then shows Hyomin being much happier and having a much better time while showing off her sexy body. Throughout the MV, it shows her being active and working out, which leads us to believe that is how she got her nice body. (I'm pretty sure that's a good thing) Then towards the end it shows the large girl from the beginning realising that her habits are bad and she decides to change it by starting to work out, which not only would give her a better body image, but also a healthier and happier lifestyle.

How would you feel if you worked out to get yourself a nice figure, showed off your nice figure and then people storm you for saying you are sending a negative message?

I really don't understand where all this negativity is coming from, like seriously, I'm a fat guy but I don't get mad at ads/posters etc showing off huge muscular guys with six packs who are topless....please discuss!

Me and my friend has been collecting, in our opinion, some of the best kpop out there and created a synctube which we use during workdays.
And we feel that it is time to spread the word about this little heaven:

The link is: [http://sync.weep.se/r/kpop](http://sync.weep.se/r/kpop)

We're currently at a 26.5 hour playlist, which is the biggest I've seen and it would be a shame not to share it.

The list consist of mainly female groups with very few exceptions.
Feel free to join, listen and contribute to weep@weep.se (oh god I'm gonna regret this)

Notice:

* SSL is accessable once logged in, ""Options &gt; Encrypt with SSL"". You might need to accept my certificate, just go to [here](https://sync.weep.se:8338/) and press accept. It encrypts the chat and player calls.
* Most songs are M/V's, but if they're not availible in high quality live versions may be added
* The server is hosted in my basement and will sometimes not be available, but I will do everything I can to get it up ASAP. It's located in Sweden on a 100/100 line. (Not that it matters since it's youtube videos)
* There are mostly girl kpop groups with a very few exceptions if their song are really really good. And also too our preference :3
* If the youbue video is blocked in your contrty .. sorry Denmark and Germany :&lt; I can't really do anything

Other fun stuff:

* All the password are encrypted on the client side with bcrypt and stored locally in my database, so it's ""secure""... I don't know if bcrypt can be trusted, up to you!
* Me and other moderators on the synctube are gods, the playlist might contain 10 songs from HELLOVENUS as a time and then be shuffled at random. We will try to shuffle at the end of songs so there wont be any jittering. And we might queue the same song like 5 times in a row becuase obvious reasons

Sorry for my poor english ... one bottle of wine deep &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

And for those who dosn't know, synctube is a tool for syncing youtube videos across ... everytnig? What you see is what everyone else sees.

Enjoy!

530,2014-7-13,2014,7,13,7,2ajk6r,The Best Of The Best K-Pop Album Tournament: Nominations,Bobfatter,1405205249,"Thought it would be interesting to conduct a best Album competition to compliment the [best song competition](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/25vyg3/the_best_of_the_best_kpop_songs_tournament_final/) we had a while back. Thanks to /u/mkbloodyen and /u/xXSquareHeadXx for the inspiration.

A few rules:

* You can nominate up to ten albums / EPs / mini-albums. No single albums please (too small). The first ten albums will be counted, if more than ten are posted.

* Before you post your list, use the search function (Ctrl+F) to see if some of those albums have already been posted. It increases the number of unique albums, and makes it easier for me when I remove duplicates.

* Non-Korean language releases are fine so long as the artist is a K-pop artist. Example: TVXQ's Five in the Black Album is OK. 

* If possible, post links to the albums or at least to representative songs on the album. It will give your nominations a better chance at being noticed, and possibly voted on. 

* Nominations will be taken through Monday at 6PM CST (ish, depends on when I get home from work), which is roughly 48 hours from now. 

* Voting periods will probably be approximately 48 hours as well.

* Last ~~rule~~ request: I'm still not sure how I want the actual voting / bracket to work, so if you have suggestions, please post them. I'm considering dividing up the original nominations into groups such as (Japanese releases, gender of group, year of release, etc.). Each division could have its own mini-tournament with the winners facing off in a final. This is not final though, just my thoughts so far.

EDIT 1: Thanks for all the responses, nominations are now closed.. I'm currently compiling results and setting up the poll. It will be up soon.

EDIT 2: [Round 1 is up](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2aq3rb/round_1_the_best_of_the_best_kpop_album/), voting lasts through 9PM CST Wednesday. ",60,18

* AoA is still my bias group. &lt;3 It's not just the girls that are loud, but so were the guys! 

http://i.imgur.com/BmizLKB.jpg


* K.Will's vocals are just so good wtf.
* Apparently they perform a song more than once (like 3 times for f(x) - Red Light) which I didn't expect
* Each group has a ""fan group leader"" which tells the other people what to do(?) One of them was a really scary girl who was yelling at other girls..
* Seeing B2ST was so fun! I love their comeback
* Some of the groups had really poor live vocals though.. I know that MBC is notorious for having mediocre sound equipment but their performances weren't that great either. Not sure if I prefer lipsync or not. Lipsync = better performance because it's really tiring for them to dance + sing at the same time. I think I'd prefer listening to a radio show for live vocals .-.
* Yes. It's loud. So loud. The girls were yelling so hard that I'll hear them in my nightmares for years to come.
* It's a small room. Not that big. Everyone had seats so that was nice. I got placed in the 2nd closest spot you could be. It sorta goes Stages &gt; Diehard fans &gt; Cameras &gt; More people. (I got stuck with the front of more people).
* Hyomin has really nice legs.
* I hope my eardrums are okay.

Overall, it was a great experience. Apparently I could've gone backstage but I left before I did :( 

Definitely recommend people checking it out or some other music show if they go to Korea. Just make sure it's not an EXO one because you WILL go deaf. (No hate, I love EXO :D)",42,83

Korean Youth organization in my city has hired a Korean exchange student, who also happens to be a dancer, to teach a beginner Kpop dance class. None of us have much dancing experience, but everyone is very enthusiastic about learning and puts some out-of-class time in to practicing what we've learned.

We've had 2 classes already (of 10 total) and the teacher has asked us to give him suggestions for dances we'd like to learn in future classes. So far we've worked on PSY ""Gentlemen"" and SNSD ""The Boys.""

I hope /r/kpop can help suggest a few more songs (maybe top 3?) that would fit the following criteria:

* Choreography that doesn't have too much member-specific choreography; i.e. something we can learn as a class

* A mix of girl group and guy group routines (the class is mixed, but I think everyone is more than willing to learn dances for both genders no matter how 'feminine' or 'masculine')

* Perhaps some routines that are *iconic* to kpop

More broadly speaking, have any of you tried to learn any kpop routines? Any words of wisdom or tips you can offer? What worked or didn't work for you when you were trying to learn? I'm not sure what makes a certain routine 'easy' or better suited to beginners, but if any of you have suggestions, I'm all ears.",25,17

The idea is to talk about K-pop not as MV countdown, cultural curio, or fashion talking point, but for the actual music. I'm substantiating the claim that K-pop has produced some of the most intelligent, adventurous, and challenging pop music in recent times.


To do the best job possible, I want to ask your help. What are the most MUSICALLY mindblowing K-pop songs you know? *Does not have to be a single or have a video,* but if it was a commercially successful song then that's a bonus. Examples of what I mean are things like ""Rum Pum Pum Pum,"" ""One Minute Back"" (SHINee), the ""Whatever They Say"" a capella by DBSK, etc. Please rack your brains for me, and maybe one of your favorite songs will wind up in a milestone K-pop article!

Description:The chart is late!!! I'm sorry! I'll bring you a video to compensate later this week! I've been really busy! So, this week I changed some things on the way I make the chart, so the volumes of all songs look more similar. We have TWELVE, YES, TWELVE new entries this week! Shoutout to F(x)'s Red Light which got the most fanvotes out of all songs last week, and to Fiestar's One More which got the most total points out of all songs. So who's first place this week? Check the chart to find out!

How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 3 points to a single song.
Thanks to all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts! Please leave a comment with your opinion if you feel like it :D",0,4

Apart from the repeats there are 175 entries for the competition. Thanks to everyone who submitted. You can view the submissions [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2ajk6r/the_best_of_the_best_kpop_album_tournament/). 

Round 1 Rules:

* Select each and every album you think is one of the best of the best. 

* The poll will be open for roughly 48 hours - 9 PM CST on Monday to 9 PM CST on Wednesday. Be sure to vote in time.

[VOTE HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y4HZxdrEO7ilZyVDFZgGo2Ay_k3484ivckeo-CBzPac/viewform?usp=send_form)

Looking Forward:

* I plan on using the Pareto Principle aka the 80-20 rule to determine which albums should advance to the 2nd round. If the number of advancing albums is too low using the Pareto principle, a bonus round may occur to increase the number of advancing albums. I will consider the need for a bonus round following the completion of voting for round 1.

* 2nd Round and beyond: Will likely follow a random grouping method with the top album (or perhaps albums) advancing out of each group. Groups will be newly created and randomized for each new round. This is mere speculation though, and may change. I am still open to suggestions for later round structure.

EDIT 1: Seems to be a link appearing for the G.NA - Black &amp; White entry, not sure why. You can ignore it though, it is not important, nor intentional. 

EDIT 2: Voting has now ended. I am compiling the votes now, and will post a new poll and results soon.",42,23

A spreadsheet with the results can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzhgyfxGnFZdMCjeWXW4U0_Wfx1E9KACUQD9huFDHhI/pubhtml).

Notes on results:

* Total responses: 485

* Total individual votes: 6652

* Average number of votes per response: 13.71

* If results have a red outline around them, they automatically advance to round 2.

* If results have a blue outline around them, they are up for re-vote in the bonus round. More on this below.

* Some of the albums that say they received 0 votes, actually received a low number. Regardless, they would not have made it to the next round. Sorry, for the inaccuracy there.

* Albums and their repackages will be changed into a single album for the next round.

Method used: 

* I attempted to use the Pareto Principle. Basically assuming that 20% of the albums would receive 80% of the votes. Instead, roughly 37% of the albums received 80% of the votes. As a result I decided that the top 20% (top 35 albums) would automatically advance to round 2. The rest of the albums inside that ~17% would be placed up for re-vote. Since I am looking to have 50 albums total advance to round 2, 19 (would have been 15, but combining repackage versions in the top tier allows for 4 extra spots in the next round) albums will advance out of the bonus round and into round 2. The 19 albums will be those that in the bonus round receive the most votes. Other albums outside of that ~17% will not be placed up for a re-vote.

Looking forward:

* Round 2 and on will have albums grouped for voting instead of pick and choose out of a list.

* I plan to make the results look better next time, I ended up doing a lot of this by hand, and got rough looking charts. Sorry about that, but should have it resolved for next time.

* The bonus round should be up tomorrow and will probably last for 24 hours. Round 2 will be up following the bonus round, and will probably last for 48 hours. New posts will be made for both rounds.",23,10

This season has four teams split up by groups of judges.  There's the Illionaire team with The Q and Dok2, the YG team with Masta Wu and Tablo, the Overclass team with San E and Swings and the YDG team.  The contestants look promising and there are a lot of people I didn't expect to show up like Snacky Chan.  This one high school girl is really nice and she's probably gonna get pretty far.  So far I'm pretty happy with it but some of the editing is still pretty bad like how Snacky Chan's and Born Kim's solo auditions in ep 2 only showed the result while they spent an eternity showing Tymee.",9,22

Rules:

* The top ~~19~~ 14 vote getters (said 19 last night, although in my defense I may have been going crazy from staring at those numbers) from the bonus round will advance to round 2. 

* Vote for as many as you like.

* In case of tie(s), albums with a greater number of votes in round 1 will advance. In case of an additional tie(s), I may make something up.

* Voting will last for 24 hours, or till 8 PM CST Friday.

[VOTE HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DehdMyZUmxf9mTjn0RLuiyoXW4Xn1xIxF4hjA2RZci0/viewform?usp=send_form)

Clarifications:

* Last night, excluding repackages I had 36 albums outlined in red, and thus advancing to round 2. Should have been only 35, but as it was my mistake, I'll leave it as was. Your welcome BTS fans.

Revised results from round 1: [advance to round 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w9y4BdC-YFVQ9hb6w69VTLzH1xMQjUIQ67bs4FJebgs/pubhtml), [advance to bonus round](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Q66CLNBH6YGYQBYtlgvJB5wm62YR1ec_cu8oY_JlFU/pubhtml)

* I played with the numbers a bit and was able to get Volume Up into the bonus round. This was done by removing the the votes of the following albums from the total vote count. Basically, I took out Misconceptions of You and Me votes, Modern Times votes, and XOXO votes. This left a total of 6246 votes instead of 6652 votes. Taking 80% of this new number equals 4996.8. The top 20% received a total of 3460 votes. Before I added Volume Up, the bonus round participants totaled 1476 votes. When I added Volume Up, the vote count totaled 1514. Adding 1514 to 3460 totals 4974 which is the closest I can get to the 80% mark without passing it.

Looking Forward:

* Round 2 will be up following the bonus round. Hopefully either Friday night or Saturday morning.

* Round 2 and on will probably follow a random group format.

some GREAT member solos. a song leo composed that he duets with ken, a ravi rap w hyuk on vocals that was SERIOUSLY amazing and better be released soon, and a hongbin/hakyeon dance to some slow remix of britney spear's ""toxic"" that gets reallly hot n heavy between the two of them at the end.

but seriously, it was awesome. if they end up coming to an area near u, try ur best to see them!! they seriously knocked it out of the park with this one.

if anybody has any questions about it, i'll be happy to answer it!! there's just way too much to write about.",35,50

Wow I didn't anticipate T-ARA to make it to #3! They only had Jiyeon and Hyomin's musical activities, but I suppose they are big in Japan and China so they were doing group activities there to bring in money. I'm happy for them.

I'm also surprised Girl's Day did better than APINK. Pink Blossom outsold 2NE1's CRUSH yet it APINK didn't have enough outside activities to earn more?",17,7

[VOTE HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VEXxDXagdFMP3vj59RDNdId3Fdv5WVjHcG6ox2Nc7zo/viewform?usp=send_form)

Round Format:

* Round will last for 48 hours, or till ~11:00 AM CST Monday.

* I randomized the 50 entries for grouping purposes. 

* Each group has 5 albums in it. 

* The top 3 vote getters in each group advance to round 3.

* Apart from those 30 that advance as mentioned above, out of the other 20, 2 more will advance based on overall score. So those albums maybe fourth or even fifth in their group, but advance due to having the highest score among non-automatic advances.

Looking Forward:

* Following rounds will probably see groups of two, possibly four in the early stages.

* Groups will be randomized.

* Round 3 will be available Monday sometime.",12,0

I'll start:

* ""No, it's a Korean group, like South Korea, not Chinese, that's c-pop.""

* ""I think I prefer the Japanese version of that song.""

* ""Yes, I actually like the music.""

* ""You've heard of Gangnam Style, right?""

* ""Yes, that was Japanese, but it's still a k-pop group.""

* ""It's not really all about singing, songwriting, and being able to play an instrument, dance ability is important too.""

* ""I actually enjoy not knowing all the lyrics.""",44,4

People have spent hours talking all about K-pop's poor English. I'm wondering what are some songs that have English parts that are actually really good and improve the song? I would prefer parts that are in otherwise Korean songs rather than full English versions.,44,40

Description: ""July Week 3... it ended up being a pretty calm week, a lot of releases but not many that got me really excited, still we have TEN new entries, 2 of them from last week/2 weeks ago. The fight for 1st place however is never calm, can one of the few new entries beat 100%, is AoA taking its sit back and keeping breaking records by getting a total of 4 weeks on the first spot, or is 100% just stay 100% still this week? Check the chart to find out! Shout out to AoA's Short Hair who once again got the most fanvotes/best general score last week!! (Even though it wasn't with a perfect score like twice before, but still awesome! :D)(Also there are going to be some changes in the voting system next month that should give you more flexibility! (You will be able to vote in songs that are not on the chart! Even though you will still have limitations).""

How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 3 points to a single song.
Thanks to all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts! Please leave a comment with your opinion if you feel like it :D",2,5

I'm probably going to be continuing to do these themed idol quizzes so if you have any ideas of themes feel free to tell me! Some ideas I have and am probably going to use are idols wearing snapbacks, idols wearing sunglasses, airport photos, side profiles, and maybe an extra hard one where I only have photos of certain bodyparts. If you have any images that you think would fit into these categories (or into a category you want to see done) you could PM me the image and I can see if I want to use it. Please include their name and group though!

I haven't really stayed up-to-date with all the MV releases this year (and perhaps part of last year). I'm looking for any help to find what I've missed so far. I'd appreciate any help.  
Two rules:  
1) Some of you may notice that the artists are all female groups/duos/soloists. That's simply for practical purposes. I only got into kpop 3 years ago and it was much easier to build a playlist by cutting the possible additions in half. This playlist will be the same: female artists only.  
2) Official MVs only. Mostly preference as I hate having videos disappear and not being able to remember what they were. Makes replacing them impossible.  
  
So, yeah. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps. The playlist is at about 50 videos right now and somewhat disorganized, but I'll hopefully get it cleaned up in the next few days.",9,0

BTS will have their first ever European concerts this weekend in Berlin, Germany (7/27) and on Tuesday in Stockholm, Sweden. As far as I know you can still get regular admission tickets at the door. Although I'm not going myself, I think it's a great opportunity for European kpop-fans. Are any of you going?

Kpop Sins are quick videos that highlight all the problems (big, small, and stupid) with Kpop videos. Most of the sins are made in jest and should not be taken seriously.

Taking some advice from my last post, this new video features different sounds than the actual Cinema Sins videos.

Personally, I like most of it, but it's usually a hit or miss for me because the SM fashion ~~terrorists~~ stylists and other company stylists because it often seems fake or trying too hard to be ""hood"" I guess.

But what do you think?

Edit: yay! Thank you for all the replies! and thanks /u/mariow08 for pointing out that the style is called streetwear. (I feel dumb for not mentioning that XD)

Kpop Sins are quick videos that highlight all the problems (big, small, and stupid) with Kpop videos. Most of the sins are made in jest and should not be taken seriously.

1243,2014-7-29,2014,7,29,6,2bzhud,Reddit 101,kjoneslol,1406584693,"## What is reddit, really?  

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of ""sub""reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of [""default"" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the ""unsubscribe"" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of ""similar subreddits"" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The [""sidebar""](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to ""subscribe/unsubscribe"" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for a subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

KCON just released information about the League of Legends event happening during the convention. I'm a little confused though. So apparently is costs $40 PER session (4 sessions total).

on top of that, 
&gt; KCON 2014 is excited to host the OGN LoL Champions for a stimulating LoL experience! Special live interviews will take place as well as a Q &amp; A Session with the K-LoL players! Players will engage with fans and have special matches with a few lucky audience members! Your LoL Experience ticket includes all of the LoL events as well as, access to the KCON marketplace which offers more than 100 premium k-culture convention programs. 

it doesn't say what the ""LoL events"" are and it includes access to the marketplace which is already included with a KCON pass. Is this event seperate from KCON or something?

What do you guys think about it? (for those who are going)

Will you be participating?

1261,2014-7-29,2014,7,29,12,2c0cjv,PSY films new DADDY M/V in Korea this week: gearing up for comeback,erixxi,1406603376,"Self-post because YG-Life takes way too long to load.

&gt;World Star PSY (real name Park Jae Sang, aged 37) is ready to kick off the filming of the music video of his new/comeback song DADDY. 

&gt;Related personnel told Star News in the morning of July 28, PSY will begin filming the M/V of DADDY this week, and added, He will travel to different places in Korea to film the video. 

&gt;They added, Since the filming will take place in different locations, the process will take longer than that of other videos. As DADDY is a fast-tempo, upbeat song that goes well with summer, the M/V will also carry that theme. 

&gt;Thus PSYs comeback became imminent, as he is onto filming the M/V after completing the lyrics and the melody of DADDY. As announced previously, PSY plans to release DADDY in the month of August. 

&gt;PSYs DADDY is building much expectation as it is his first official comeback song since GENTLEMAN released April last year. 

&gt;He unveiled an advance-release song HANGOVER in early June this year, but did not promote the song on stage. But with DADDY, he will be actively promoting it home and abroadhence the spotlight pouring over the upcoming song. 

&gt;Despite not promoting the song HANGOVER on stage, PSY successfully attracted 100 million viewers on just his official YouTube channel in one month. It is no wonder all eyes are on the outcome of DADDY, as he will be promoting the song actively. 

&gt;PSY attended the wedding ceremony of the soccer player Park Ji Sung and SBSs former anchor Kim Min Ji in the evening of July 27 at Seoul Sheraton Grand Walkerhill Hotel, wishing the newly-weds a happy future with other guests like Lee Byung Heon, Park Chan Ho, Park Tae Hwan, Kim Chang Ryul, Park Soh Hyun, Kim Soo Hee, Guus Hiddink, and Patrice Evra.

I wanted to try and get this out while the MV was hot, but it ended up taking me longer than I thought. I hope you enjoy it and don't skewer me for the two (probably) controversial sins.

Kpop Sins are quick videos that highlight all the problems (big, small, and stupid) with Kpop videos. Most of the sins are made in jest and should not be taken seriously.

Is there any cultural impact?

I know that Bubble Pop got her alot of flack from native Koreans, even though it had brought a lot of attention to Kpop from outside countires, so what is the reaction to her newest solo release? 

In short, is Korean culture as a whole beginning to openly endorse female sexuality, or just tacitly pandering to western tastes?",3,0

* seductive cliche looking-over-the-shoulder look
* topless while holding a baboon

Okay, overall thoughts now.  This music video was fun to watch and critique.  The music isn't all too bad, it's only the first verse where she sounds like Nicki Minaj that puts me off.  Her rapping is amazing and the chorus has a nice melodic tune and a great, short buildup to a pumping chorus.  Her style is repeated words in a chorus over dance music and that's cool.  Another element of Hyuna is her following verse (i.e. second verse, is much softer than the first verse and chorus in terms of volume and pace)  I love the breakdowns in her songs (like the one in '[Bubble Pop!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw9CALKOvAI)' The dance is cool to watch (hehe ass/10)

Video: 10/10 because ass  
Song: 8.5/10 (song lyrics were great, +1 for arabian themed bass breakdown)
