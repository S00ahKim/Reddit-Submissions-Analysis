26,2016-3-1,2016,3,1,14,48esca,MVs that produced extreme reactions from you,Yui_Tomatogrinder,1456810878,"So I'd like to know what MVs have given you major feels especially anything that made you bawl like a baby. I'm a glutton for it. 

To get the ball rolling:

[VIXX - Error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF8kySIcWNw). Aaaah this gets me every time particularly the 'uploading memory' scene combined with the piano line. 

[Bonus slayage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0sJDGrRD8) - this older guy's reaction to Error is just... oof. This was actually how I discovered VIXX and became a fan believe it or not. 

[The Ark - The Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-cOZgaotPY) - I hated it for playing with our emotions so blatantly but dammit it worked. 

On the opposite spectrum, which MV has repulsed or disturbed you? 

I think I'm turning into a Starlight - VIXX again, with [Voodoo Doll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOG7BexjPjM) was wonderfully sadistic and flinch inducing. I'd love to know if anything comes close to it? ",78,41

30,2016-3-1,2016,3,1,17,48fcxg,What songs make you recall happy/sad memories?,simplyjcc,1456822244,"For me it would have to be:

[Boyfriend - Don't Touch My Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1cZ2uzxCjI)

[Teen Top - No More Perfume on You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT4LzAWcmds)

[SNSD - Kissing You &amp; Also many of the early SNSD songs as they remind me of the pure and innocent girls they once were haha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzrgZ11xc0o)

[KARA - Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_AQ7AkVzpM)

[SS501 - LOVEYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqHX9YmqeyQ)

[MBLAQ - Mona Lisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SenkemTrZMQ)

39,2016-3-1,2016,3,1,21,48fxam,Which disbanded and/or unsuccessful groups were you a fan of?,TamangPanahon,1456833804,"I liked a few of HAM's songs (Heart and Mind) before their mysterious disappearance from the K-Pop scene. Some songs for the curious:  

* Debuted with [TT Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeChuW--eIQ) - Had a nice rock intro with a very different chorus that threw a lot of people off  
* [Pitter-Patter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fzwnwG1n4)  
* [So Sexy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suvdnufZjRY)  
* [Lower Your Sight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzIm-E62ICU)

According to [this](http://www.teamliquid.net/blogs/409230-kpop-heart-and-mind-a-group-that-just-disappeared), it turns out that after being one of the many groups that were shipped to Japan and a member leave, one of the members redebuted in a new group back in 2012. I haven't heard of that group either.  

Also, what happened to GLAM was very unfortunate. I loved [Party XXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T62b-FxzxA), [I Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwm7IlPO1Uo), and [In Front of the Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PreOQpat5Mg).",247,51

I bought a bunch to be one of the top supporters (was number 2 T_T), and now I need to sell these. They're priced only a bit more than it would cost to buy sealed ones ($30 shipped if you're in the US that is), mainly just to cover shipping (the albums are huge &gt;_&lt;) 

The album has four different (one for each member), and each member signed their own cover.

I'd like to know which show do people here prefer and why? And what sets them apart - what does Show Champion do that's different to Inkigayo for example? 

And is there a place to watch full subbed episodes anywhere?

I think every group is represented somewhere here. Hopefully the images are high enough quality to read the smaller ones. Also a lot of the names are in Hangul just as a warning.

Some information first:

* I am shipping from Canada, and I'll ship anywhere as long as you cover the cost. It's usually around $10 outside of Canada, and $5-10 within Canada (depending on how big it is) for albums, and just $1-2 for photocards anywhere.
* **If I give you a price, it will include shipping and be in USD. Please include where you are located when you post/pm!** (Or that will be the first question I ask you ;D)
* I'm open to offers on everything! I also have a general idea of how much I want for everything, so you can ask if you're not sure.
* Nothing includes the photocard, if I have the card that came with the album it will be listed under photocards. Also discounts with the more things you buy~
* Everything is in great condition unless otherwise noted. CDs probably only played once/twice. All signatures were either from Mwave or Soompi
* I accept Paypal or CC (but CC is at your own risk)

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
**1)  Famous Hollywood actor Jack Black and Veteran MC Conan O'Brien were also invited to Korea. What does Chloe Moretz think is the charm of Korea?**|I think Korean culture itself is just unique. I have been to many other Asian countries but Korea's culture is just the best and it seems like other Hollywood Stars think so too.
**2) Is there a reason you always come to Korea with your handsome older brother?**|He takes on a family manager role and helps me with my work. It is more relaxing to go on overseas schedules with family and it helps with my psychological mindset too.
**3) Chloe Moretz has a lot of popularity here in Korea. Why do you think they give you so much love?**|Korean fans have always welcomed me here and I am very grateful for that. Personally, I think that since the first time I came I have been on many programs and have been able to communicate with the fans, that's why.
**4) Who is Chloe's Top 3 Korean stars and why?**|Mamamoo is Number 1. I really became a fan because of 'Taller Than You (1cm )'. The 4 members of Mamamoo are my top 4, I've become a fan to that high of a degree. Another one I would pick out is CL. I like all of her songs. I'm really a fan of hers.
**5) Your SNL Korea 7 appearance was a topic. Being able to digest Korea's Makjang dramas and comedy, you provided many laughs with the Kimchi Slap.**|It was seriously ridiculously funny. In reality the lead up to hitting someone with kimchi is already absurd, after doing the kimchi slap, kimchi was everywhere - In the soup, on the walls.. and we all saw it and couldn't stop laughing. There were no NG's and we finished in one take.
**6) Could you say something to your Korean fans**|I am always grateful for the welcoming I get when I come, I don't want to leave yet, but I will come back as soon as I possibly can. I want to learn even more about Korean culture. I love Korea.",27,89

&gt; Someone from 6-member group with surname ""Yoon"" got arrested for drunk driving last night. And refused to stop for police.

It allows them to venture in new directions without sabotaging their idol image brand, and of course, try to innovate! 

On that note, SM has so many groups with many talented artists and performers, but they don't necessarily get the limelight, so /r/kpop,  who would you like to see have a release in the future? What kind of song do you envision them doing if they were to break away from the idol image for moment and just get funky?",53,17

What should your group's management, production team or members themselves look to be improving on for their next release?  
  
I'm really looking forward to Twice's comeback already and there are several things I wish to see them addressing.  
  


-----------------
**Line Distribution &amp; Roles**
 

Their debut EP was excellent and all the songs were enjoyable but the line distribution throughout was kinda messy. I've written it off as them being new and JYP's team hasn't really figured out who is the best at what role (apart from Jihyo/Nayeon/Chaeyoung). Momo has clear rap and singing parts, as do Dahyun and Chaeng. Jungyeon's voice was barely featured in Like Ooh-Ahh but you can hear her prominently in the other songs.
  
For their next release I hope they iron out these issues. Give a balanced distribution for their title tracks, and give each member an opportunity to shine in various songs (e.g. Mina is very prominent in Candy Boy). 
  
Jungyeon and Jihyo should not get solo parts too close to one another, due to how... loud they are. In Like Ooh-Aah Jungyeon's part tends to get overshadowed by Jihyo's volume.  
  
As for roles, I think it's okay to let them be multi-role but let each member who represent this do so in differing songs. Getting Dahyun and Chaeyoung to rap together all the time may not be the best (Like A Fool for example), and both have decent singing voices.  
  
-------------------  
  
**Variety**  
  
Running Man pls. That is all. They done a grand job of getting everyone to appear on shows in smaller groups.

Unfortunately, when we went to buy tickets they wouldn't let us in because the club doesn't allow foreigners. 

Totally bummed out, we reached out to Jessi on Instagram and she seemed upset about their rules, but ultimately nothing happened.

Just thought this would be an interesting story to Kpop fans worldwide about some of the racist policies of Korean clubs. 


 UPDATE:  I sent a Facebook message to the club and they said they had changed the policy (see imgur photo below). I am hoping that Jessi talked to them and changed it because she rules!

Also: pretty disheartening to read all the xenophobic/prejudiced views here from fellow kpop fans",288,165

It's been quite awhile since our last playlist. This is due to some personal complications (exams) and some evaluation over the format and reception of the playlists. The last playlist, Indie and Acoustic Sounding received 50 nominations, so I created two playlists (one with the top 50%) and one with all the songs nominated. I'd like these weeks to continue as long as possible, so feel free to contribute.

Here are the previous weeks' playlists.

**[\[Week 1 - Cheerful / Mood Lifting\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHg9jrbVhcXJ91Kq7T_jcfSP)**

**[\[Week 2 - Sad / Heartbroken\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjtCQvQftdB1M8FVTpm42Xc)**

**[\[Week 3 - Hip-Hop + R&amp;B\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjig_XDbMrLJYHvti36EuOi)**

**[\[Week 4 - Workout / Hype\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHgZDiVNF4H5UOfGKLrF0wBE)**

**[\[Week 5 - Chill / Mellow\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHgm_B9TZNM65v8RGOfcxs4a)**

**[\[Week 6 - Kpop B Songs\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjvLw3FXawz6JHSRrlVBDmB)**

**[\[Week 7 - Driving &amp; Cruising\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHir9XFWqUOqQhLiURahcHGh)**

**[\[Week 8 - Indie and Acoustic Sounding\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHgM8Qkz0CTazEqGpMMXD_C1)** | **[\[Full Version\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzpC_yk4IDHjg7x2oFGFeR6_0_xNB_32o)**

-----------------------------

Sexy Time and Love Making is this week's theme! This theme includes songs that get you in the mood to go hard in the paint, seductive songs that make you love the artist/others or songs that'd you'd  leave in the background as you Netflix and Chill.

If you have any questions with the theme, feel free to pm me about it.


------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **roughly this time next week**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

These are the upcoming themes:

* Dance and Uptempo (Party!)

* Romantic Ballads / Slow Love Songs

* Electro / Futuristic Kpop

* Dark / Sinister

* Remixes

* Boy Groups / Girl Groups

If there remains a fair amount of disinterest, a finale week theme will be presented!

I put together an app that helps me do exactly that: get the latest K-pop music charts (Melon) and play the songs I want from YouTube.

1133,2016-3-16,2016,3,16,20,4andno,K-Pop songs that sound better when released in Japanese?,NoSchittSherlockSEA,1458128376,"From experience, this is a relatively uncommon sight. Generally, the lyrics are just direct translations and the flow of words tend to be messy as a result (See EXO's love me right romantic universe: the chorus is a Mouthful), they tend to use auto tune unnecessarily (can be a good thing in some cases), and maybe sometimes just don't sound right. I do like listening to Japanese versions of songs because when I get sick of the Korean version but not too sick that I don't want to enjoy it, I play the Japanese version.

For me, I've noticed two songs that are Better in Japanese:

 [Very Good - Block B](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HmgcXPpCo) (rap flows aren't changed that much, and also largely due to U-Kwon's New lines. doki doki hara hara indeed.) 

[Crooked - G DRAGON](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R-vtaZJC3FA) : This is a rare case. GD's rap actually has more intensity and gratiness in this version that holds true to the lyrics. Plus the unexpected rapid fire rap that was NOWHERE TO BE HEARD in the original at 2:18.

Any more kpop songs better in Japanese you know of?",110,54

You can also compete against other kpoppers in how fast you can recognize your favorite kpop groups.

It's both a learning device, and a game.

It wasn't easy, but I actually loaded all the kpop groups that I know (115 groups), so every group you probably know should be there.

Hope you'll have fun with it! And I'd like to hear some feedback from you :)

It's available on android's play store under the name [KpopFaces](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kpopfaces.kpopfaces), or via the website [here](http://kpopfaces.com)!

I'm honestly starting to think that there are people here who don't have a single Korean ballad that they actually enjoy.

 I'm curious about what ballads you enjoy and feel stand out, out of those of you who do enjoy some kpop ballads, and hopefully people who don't listen to many ballads can discover some K-pop ballads that they actually enjoy from it.

Also on a sidenote I'm actually a big fan already of 'One Of These Nights' now after a few plays, there's something quite dreamlike and fairytale-ish to it, and I absolutely adore the tempo change halfway.",66,28

(Proposition/Introductory),viwolic,1458170064,"On /r/nintendo, a user recently started a series in which, as voted by users, each week a Nintendo franchise was discussed. Discussions revolved around their love for the series, how they were introduced to them, favourite aspects of the game, etc. etc. 

I know this conversation would be more suited for the likes of /r/kpopslumberparty but as others have stated, there's more people here. 

I was thinking once or twice a week, and once a group has been voted, they cannot be discussed again.

What do you think? What do you think would make this concept more viable for this sub? What should the frequency be? How should artists be determined?

**EDIT**: And I'm back! I'm happy people are interested in this series. The thought never dawned on me to message a mod, so I will do so after this to make sure they are okay with this.

Thank you for the input, more input is definitely welcomed as I further make notes to figure out the best possible way to do this. I hope this is approved and successful, I'd love to learn about other groups and soloists. 

Also, I need your help! What should we call this series, I feel like ""Why do you love them"" is so bland. Anywho, I'm off to play some smash, be back soon~

**EDIT AGAIN**: I have been in talks with the mods! AND THEY APPROVED! I will be taking any and all input and will come out with a formal introduction and poll in a few days~ Thank you for being so encouraging",16,53

1264,2016-3-18,2016,3,18,1,4attjz,Knetizen Red Velvet fan's interpretation of One of These Nights (July 7th) Music Video,seulgitho,1458231171,"&gt; The theme of this song is Shi Yue Hao (Sewol South Korea Ferry) Ship Wreck, f(x)s Red Light is also about that ship, the release date of the song is July 7th. The incident occurred on 20140416 which is march 17th on the lunar calendar. On the album cover, Yeris face is blurred because shes the same age with the victim of the incident, in the MV, Yeri is lying down on the boat and ended up drowned. There are scenes of water in the MV, every member had as escaping action, like Joy climbing ladder, Seulgi opening a window and water going into Irenes room and also Wendy crawling under a table. On some part, Seulgi keep on peaking out at the keyhole, its because she cant get out from her room and shes watching the ship sunken slowly through it. And finally on the cover, everyone is wearing a hood and holding a candle, theyre commemorating the incident. At the end of the MV, when the word 'red velvet came out in red, it indicates death. Anyway, SM said they delayed the MV due to quality changed, its because they changed the video aspect ratio to 1.33:1 which represents the past, memories and old movies, 16:9 ratio to 1:1 is the recent years, widening to 2.35:1 refers to present time. Update: Also, some theory say that SM delayed the release for a day is implying the goverments slow action on rescue students or people in Sewol. (Some of the article regarding the incident to MV scene: 1 (The story about 16 years old girl expected to be Yeri), 2 (The weather report on the day when the ship sinking choppy, frigid conditions, wind, rain and seabound fog theres a scene where Wendy standing under heavy rain, Seulgi looking out at the window when its raining, Yeri sleeping in the boat under the rain, and Joy standing in a forest with her hair flying because of the wind).

Again, of course, just an interpretation. To add to it though, the lyrics are all about losing/missing someone you love. Yeri said on a recent radio interview that she thinks about her grandmother who passed away when she sings this song and Wendy said she thought of her family back home in Canada. Also, could be coincidence but their special fansign for this album will be held on a cruise ship.. ",35,104

[This article \(in korean\)](http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000791451) also confirms this. I for one am very excited about the next OST track, I've been blown away so far, thought other people might enjoy some upcoming info.

I tried translating the (short) article:

""Kim Junsu is the next surprise addition to the Descendants of the Sun OST.

C-JeS Entertainment revealed Junsu's participation via Instagram earlier today, with a photo accompanied by the caption ""So suddenly? Please wait a little bit longer. Coming soon. Song Joong-Ki X Kim Junsu OST meeting is a good sign.""""

The rest of it just talks about his hair, him looking at the lyrics intently, and then it mentions a number of netizen reaction comments including ""Kim Junsu is "" which I thought was cute. ",6,42

1342,2016-3-19,2016,3,19,2,4az95c,[Discussion] Watch a music video of a group you don't know that well. See if you can pick out the leader/maknae/visual/main vocalist/main dancer/etc.,NT019,1458321183,"Just last week, I was heavily encouraged to check out BTS and decided to do something fun with it. I watched [BTS - Dope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM).

* **First Guy/Military Uniform** *(Leader)* - He does the intro for the music video so I assumed he was either the leader or the most popular member. Reminds me a little of JB. Tries hard to be cool, but is probably a huge derp.
* **Police Officer** *(Main Dancer)* - Bad boy of the group. In charge of sex appeal. If the group did a haunted house special, he's the type that would laugh the entire way through.
* **Red Hair** *(Main Vocalist)* - Seems really serious and mature. Gives me D.O. vibes. Constantly judges everyone. Doesn't know why he is stuck with these losers.
* **Racer Suit** - Seems like he would be the best at variety. Super energetic. Probably engages in a lot of fanservice. Touchy feely with the other members. Does the best aegyo.
* **Bleach Blonde Rapper/Surrounded by UFOs** - For some reason, the only description I can think of is feisty chihuahua.
* **Suit With Shorts/Deep Voice** *(Visual)* - He's got the whole pretty face/deep voice thing going for him. In variety shows, he probably uses the words ""chic"" or ""cold city boy"" to introduce himself.
* **Doctor** *(Maknae)* - Super squishy. There are a lot of evil maknaes in the industry, but I don't think he's one of them. Probably the member to be deathly afraid of bugs. 

After writing this out, I started watching American Hustle Life and realized that most of my assumptions were super wrong (BTS fans are probably side-eyeing me hardcore right now). It made me curious as to what other people's first impressions were of my favorite groups. 

If you're a seasoned K-Pop veteran, then suggest fun videos for other people to watch.

Just for shits and gigs, I did an abbreviated version with [Lovelyz - Ah-Choo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7qisJ_KuYI). 

Disclaimer: I knew there were members named Kei and Baby Soul, but I didn't know who these members were. Other than that, these are all fresh first impressions.

Since everyone is wearing the same clothes and has similar hairstyles, I going to use time codes to tell them apart.

* **00:22** - Best dancer (I don't think Lovelyz really focuses much on dancing). I think this is Kei. A good all-rounder. Most popular member.
* **00:30** - Visual. Super cute and bubbly. One of those fake maknaes. 
* **00:37** - Leader. Probably Baby Soul because she looks like a fucking baby. I totally get kid leader vibes.
* **01:50** - Main vocalist and maknae.

I know there are other Lovelyz members, but I was just trying to pick out the main roles for this one. Obviously, yours doesn't have to be as extensive as mine, but I just thought this would be an interesting experiment of sorts.",184,89

We all know what cohesive albums sound like. To help stop this from becoming top 10 favs lists I guess I'll put a few must haves: 

* A clear intro. Of only one person. You can choose if they're a soloist or group member ect

* A ballad (or just a slower tempo song in general)

* Pick the title track 

* Pick secondary promoted track 

* can't pick more than 3 songs of same artist

* Bonus if you like: Pick for the repackage too with what you would add and what would be the promoted track. 

Try as best as you can to have an overall theme/genre please

Edit: wow you guys really got creative! Some really awesome mixes and track lists. Was a great way to discover some cool music similar to what I already like. ",81,112

1387,2016-3-19,2016,3,19,17,4b2egd,Hyunseung is officially not attending Beast's 1st Fan meeting in Manila,blablapurple,1458376604,"Yesterday, 5 of Beast's members were seen at the airport going to Manila without Hyunseung. Many fans speculated that he would either not be attending or be on a later flight. 

A couple hours before the fan meeting, AAP(organizers) officially announced that Hyunseung would not be attending the event. They said that Cube had told them this information ""a while ago"" but still carried through with releasing the news at the last minute. Frankly, this is a cheap ploy from Cube since they knew that if they had released the news before ticket sales, many fans would not have bought a ticket had they known that Hyunseung wasn't attending. And this is their second time doing it-- Macau being the first. They also cancelled the press conference for today's event. Guess why?

I don't believe that Hyunseung has the authority to skip whatever events he wants to. I think that Cube, who manages its artists, is intentionally not allowing him to do so for whatever reason (background dispute, etc). If they are in fact allowing him to skip the events for what they claim to be ""personal reasons"" they would have shown him and the fans respect by announcing his absence earlier. 

Unfortunately, the fans and Hyunseung will become victims because of this happening-- again... OT5! F*ck Hyunseung! Attitude problems! I can see why YG dropped him!

I understand that Reddit Kpop has a weak b2st fanbase. This article will probably be downvoted so much like my other posts... But I hope that those who came to ""hate"" question their source of malice and redirect their energy into something more positive.

# Flowsik
# Tinamina (aka wiggle like jello girl, she's a songwriter under Joombas - same as DEAN).
# Aaron Lim
# Gemini
# Metoo
# Lafic
# O.V
# Versatile
# JKey

That's who I know of so far. Also Superbee was seen at the audition but probably there to boost hype for the audition as he already auditioned in Seoul.

EDIT: Lena Ahn (ex-JYP trainee) was spotted there also.

EDIT 2: Far East Movement posted on their snapchat a few days ago that they were at the filming for 2nd round of the SMTM5 LA auditions, alongside Dumbfoundead.",27,35

-----------------------------

Dark / Sinister is the theme for this week! This theme embodies those creepy, imaginative or terrifyingly emotional songs that leave you with goosebumps and second thoughts. This is a break from the bubbly, stereotypical kpop and ventures into deeper, darker territories. 

Feel free to ask questions to me or the nominators to see perceptions on nominated songs.


------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **roughly this time next week**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

These are the upcoming themes:

* Dance and Uptempo (Party!)

* Romantic Ballads / Slow Love Songs

* Electro / Futuristic Kpop

* Remixes

* Boy Groups / Girl Groups

A final playlist week is coming up soon!

For those unfamiliar, last week I had propositioned a new [Discussion Series]( https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4aqcu3/discussion_why_do_you_love_them/) for /r/kpop and it was met with a warm reception. A name change and a week later, Im glad to finally kick things off! 

______________________________________________________

**What is K-Spotlight?**

K-Spotlight is a Weekly Discussion Series in which an Artist is the focus of discussion. Anything from what you love about the artist, your favourite songs, what they have done for the music industry, how you got into them, why others should love them, etc. This is your time to put your idol in the /r/kpop limelight.

**Why are you doing this?**

My main goal is to bring attention to any and all artists, especially the less known. I also would like to get the community involved in more discussions and encourage stronger friendships. Hell, if this takes off, I may come up with more Discussion Series down the line.

**How can we vote?**

Each week, there will be a secondary post/comment that will say Polling Station. In that comment thread alone, you will leave your votes. Those with the most votes within the specified timeframe will win and a Discussion will be made for that artist.

**Are there any Rules and/or Restrictions?**

Yes!

1. After an artist has been discussed, they can no longer be voted for an additional week.*

2. This is not a my artist&gt;other artists discussion, that will not be tolerated

3. Votes will only be accepted within the first 48 hours of poll creation.

**When will the Discussions take place?**

The winning artist discussion thread will go live every Friday at 6pm EST!

**Any additional, necessary information?**

*If an artist has already been discussed but are later having a comeback, an additional thread will be created for them, but in /r/kpopslumberparty in order not to clog up the /r/kpop feed, especially when we have more artists under our belt.

**1. Introduction:**
You hear kpop for the first time, whether from stumbling upon music videos on YouTube or because your friends keep telling you to do so and you just want to shut them up. You then end up liking some of the songs by one or two groups and maybe you even download a few of them. 

**2. Expansion:**
You begin to expand your kpop music library to include more songs from the same groups and songs from new groups that you've stumbled upon. 

**3. Visualization:**
You then begin to binge watch music videos of all the songs that you've downloaded. This is when you find yourself saying ""I have no idea what I'm watching, and I don't care because I think I like it."" 

**4. Observation:**
This is when you start to watch the live performances of the different groups. You then start to binge watch these live performances and maybe you even find more new songs that you like and download later. 

**5. Examination:**
While watching the live performances, you noticed that each of the songs has a corresponding choreographed dance. You then start to watch some dance practice videos of those songs. Maybe you even attempt some of those dances only to end up failing miserably and you eventually give up. 

**6. Identification:**
During this stage, you start to learn the names of each of the members of your favorite groups. You keep this up until you are able to instantly recognize those members. 

**7. Characterization:**
You begin to watch variety shows that feature some of the groups and members as guests. This is when you learn of all the different personalities and hidden talents that each of the members possess. You may also develop some biases within each of these groups. 

**8. Obsession:**
The final stage. You realize that your love for kpop has reached extreme levels. Kpop has, literally, taken over your life because you realize kpop *is* life. Once this stage is reached, there is no going back. 

Let me know what you guys think. Did I misplace a stage, or did I forget a stage? And let me know which stage you think you're in. ",80,120

Groups are constantly making comebacks with new concepts, and a lot of times they'll experiment with new sounds with non-promoted songs in their albums. 

In this thread, comment what you think are the best songs by your favorite group based upon the categories of Dance pop, cute, sexy, R&amp;B, ballad, and hip-hop. Bonus points for including a chill and relaxed song, which is my favorite type of music, like [BTS - Moving On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBgL81okXtg) or [Lim Kim - Upgrader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJu2z2xih0)

BTS, my bias group, has a wealth of content that showcases their personalities, and all their videos and variety shows helped me fall in love with them. For people interested in BTS, I would recommend watching all of [American Hustle Life](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4fA2qlZAUH0j6KgCGZ5DPGAeTtXQ5fZe)- they're in L.A. for the duration of the show, learning about hip hop from the likes of Coolio and Warren G. Some fans say that the entire show is cringe-worthy, but I really don't think so at all. They go through a lot of challenges, and seem to grow as artists, friends, and individually throughout the show, which was really cool to watch.

I'm interested in a lot of groups, but it's hard to dedicate time to searching for the things I *must watch*...I figure the experts on that would be fans themselves!

So, please help me out! Tell me what to watch for your bias group and why you love it :) 

Edit: I really appreciate all of the responses, everyone! I'm happy to have so much content to get through. I really love this genre of music and I want to appreciate as many groups as possible. Thanks again!",114,54

[From her IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDVLAZft-iN/?taken-by=ajol_llama)

'' Before the song is released there are a couple things I'd like to share. This song took me a lot of courage to write because I was always apprehensive of the subject it talked about. I've been doing this job for a long time and right now I speak not as Amber of f(x) nor ""celebrity"" Amber, but just Amber. Just plain, simple, human Amber. ""Borders"" is more than a song; no glamorous concepts, no ""trying to be cool."" Its a raw and real story about reality. Its shares, not only about my personal experiences but of people very close to me. Everyone involved in this project- the producers, my team DPR, the actors, to the staff- were people specifically chosen as they have never given up on me and believed in my vision. For that, I want to thank them for making this possible for me. When you guys listen to ""Borders"", there is just one thing i wish everyone could take from it: NEVER give up on yourself. There is always hope in the midst of this dark, demanding world. In the end, live for those that did not get the chance to and just keep fighting. Always, thank you you guys.

EDIT2: [2NE1's stylist shared a photo](https://twitter.com/welovebom/status/713004631530405888) of all the Polaroids they took at Bom's birthday party. So yes, they did have a birthday party for Bom!

Before anyone asks ""where's Minzy?"" [Minzy's maternal grandmother passed away a few days ago](https://twitter.com/GlobalMinzy/status/712189701155848193), so she's probably with her family right now. EDIT1: [Minzy's mom and dad](https://twitter.com/honestblackjack/status/712898967445614592) liked a photo of Bom that was tagged with Bom's birthday hashtag #AlwaysYou

You may be wondering why anyone cares or why this is noteworthy. Bom has not posted on SNS since June 2014 when her scandal happened. Also, no one has posted any photos with her since that time as well (aside from fans posting photos of her leaving/going into the YG building). YG usually creates a birthday graphic when someone has a birthday, but they did not create one for Bom last year or this year. I've also seen many comments (not just here, but on other platforms) saying that ""Bom ruined 2NE1"" or that ""CL doesn't care about 2NE1."" I wanted to share this post to show that 2NE1 still care for each other and that Bom is not forgotten.",38,208

1812,2016-3-25,2016,3,25,5,4bt9w3,[Discussion] The Ark's agency adds new idol band and girl group to artist lineup (x-post from /r/thearkpop),HvDreamer,1458849739,"Upon request of 2 The Ark fans at /r/thearkpop I decided to repost this [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/thearkpop/comments/4bqrna/discussion_revamped_musick_site_adds_new_idol/) here.

**Official Site:** http://musick.co.kr/main/index.php

**Idol Band ""Iz's"" artist page:** http://musick.co.kr/main/newpage.php?f_id=comming_iz

**Girl Group ""WHITE"" artist page:** http://musick.co.kr/main/newpage.php?f_id=comming_white

**Photo of Halla and Jane under Auditions:** http://musick.co.kr/main/newpage.php?f_id=sub3_audition

The Ark is nowhere to be found on their site.  I suspect that MusicK has decided to put the members of The Ark into this new ""girl group"" that's slated to debut in 2017.

Also, here's their new Official Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU1oDnIY82IaWJX747z8BcQ/featured

Notice how ""The Light"" MV is the only upload without the name of its respective artist.

So, um... what are your thoughts on this?  ""WHITE"" is most likely a tentative name for the group.",36,112

Veteran hip-hop crew Epik High sat down for an interview with 'The Celebrity' magazine!

SEE ALSO: Epik High hilariously promotes their invitation to 'Coachella' in new clip

During the interview, when asked what rappers talk about, the members answered, ""We talk about really dumb things. We hang out with AOMG guys and rapper Yankie a lot, but if we hang out for 3 hours, literally for 2 of those hours we just talk about which short celebrities out there are shorter than us.""

Well are the members fun around each other? According to Tablo, ""When we were younger, we would go perform overseas and hang out in a room together before going to sleep. But these days, we just use our own separate rooms, and don't leave them much. We catch up on dramas or play games. Sorry, this is probably really boring. But you know what's more boring than this? Our lives.""

When the interviewer tried to refute them, the members intervened, saying, ""We live happy lives, but we're not sure if happy and fun are the same. Our lives are actually pretty peaceful. A lot of people think that hip-hop artists or rock artists have that kind of brilliance about them, but we don't.""

You definitely can't always live a fun-filled life all the time! Check out Epik High's pictorial cuts below, where they worked with graffiti artist Madvictor!

Popular girl group GFRIEND is scheduled to enter the Japanese music industry this year.

After making a comeback with Rough in January, the group has enjoyed great success and numerous trophies. They have received 15 trophies from various music shows and proved their popularity.

While enjoying all of this love, the group will be embarking on the challenge of promoting overseas.

Their agencys CEO So Sung Jin commented, We are currently pushing ahead to enter Japan and China at the same time. We actually met with agencies in Japan last year to feel it out. On the other hand, we are being more cautious about China compared to Japan.

He continued, We are in discussion with approximately five companies as potential partners in Japan. We will make our decision based on how much they can spend to help GFRIENDs Japanese promotions rather than the amount of the down payment.

GFRIENDs CEO further revealed, GFRIEND will enter the Japanese market this year no matter what. It is highly likely that they will release a new song this summer and head to Japan after promoting in Korea.

Girl groups like KARA, Girls Generation, 2NE1, and more have been successful in Japan. Unfortunately, KARA has disbanded and 2NE1 is not promoting as a group these days.

An industry insider shared, Besides Girls Generation, the only other [Korean] girl group receiving attention in Japan is A Pink. Japanese agencies are eager to bring over new K-pop girl groups. So I think GFRIEND, who rose to stardom earlier this year, could bring the best contents.

Do you think GFRIEND can be popular in Japan, China, and elsewhere?

1909,2016-3-26,2016,3,26,8,4byx4i,How successful do you see CL's western debut being?,IramBM,1458948125,"So I've only recently heard about or looked into CL and her attempt to break out into the US scene.

In my opinion, even though the only solo of hers I've liked is hello bitches (which I think is the perfect look and style she should be going over) I really believe she'll be a massive hit and quicly rise to be one of THE top divas.

I feel like she has it all. She's great at English, she can rap and sing really well too, she's pretty, is considered very stylish, etc and she seems ot be the most connected person in kpop.

Not only that, but the big thing that could potentially derail her big time; being a rapper who isn't black, see Iggy Azaelia, I feel her being Asian will actually help rather than hinder her. She's already hung out with people like Nicki Minaj etc who had the potential to really stop her career before it started if they ran with the race issue. But that hasn't happened, and I also feel Korean/Asian tradition of being very humble will really hlp her along with getting accepted too.


However, from what I've seen, there's a LOT of skepticism about it from a lot of fans and a fair few in this sub, which cover a lot of topics.


I'm bringing this up now because her debut seems ot be imminent, a lot fo fashion magazines seem to be covering her, she had that fashion youtube video based on hello bitches, and I've just seen her track with will i am released.


So this is maybe a prediction thread, or a discussion thread. How successful do you see her actually being, what do yuo think will help/hinder her.
Also do you support it?",19,0

In some cases it was because of personality differences but in other cases it was just a couple of people just fell apart. 

It was amazing since groups usually have trained with one another for years and on top of that spend most of their time together mostly soon after debuting. Most groups in their shows admit that some groups members are closer to other other members but in Lovelyz it almost made them seem like total strangers. 

I was glad that Lovelyz was honest enough and trusted their fans enough to show this of their group. They didn't have to because something like this could cause controversy but instead they were very open about. I wonder if other groups are the same. Most groups admit that some members are closer to other members but not the distance that I saw from Lovelyz. 

Maybe its just a Lovelyz thing? What do you think?",100,70

1. Organiser invited EXO but didnt give them their performance fees(?)/appearance fees, but EXO still came out to perform 5 (but some fan-accts said 6) songs for the fans


2. When EXO members were talking, they actually wanted to say thank you to the fans, but said sorry suddenly. The fans didnt know why when they said that.

3. They emphasised that today (yesterday at the concert) that it was EXO-Ls 600th day.

4. EXO members spoke a lot of mandarin, seemed like were well-prepared before coming to the concert. But when they spoke Korean, the organisers translator probably learnt Korean himself, so his translations had a lot of mistakes.

5. The stools that the members sat were those kinds of 10yuan plastic stools

6. The organiser didnt arrange for a rehearsal, the sound system was really sucky

7. Even though EXO met with these kinds of situations, they still comforted the fans that they will come back to China again.

8. They wore their performance outfits on their own, and went on stage to perform without makeup, and some of the members were actually injured, while some got approved leaves from their own respective events.

9. Because the organiser escaped(?), SM didnt want EXO to come already, but EXO still came because of the fans, when they left, they didnt even change out of their outfits. 

EXOEXO510:309:00(cr: 

* Invited EXO to perform, but didnt have the money to pay them for their performance fees. Organiser still requested for the fans to prepare backstage clothes rack, irons, and etc. They still collected over 10,000yuan from the fans for booth fees. The security hit people, scalpers lied to the fans saying that there are interactive sessions (between EXO and the fans), and front row tickets was sold at over 10000yuan! In the end, EXO only performed 5 songs. In the contract, it was stated that the concert will end at 10.30pm, but it ended at 9pm instead.

* Minseoks(XIUMIN) c-fans (his tieba + fansites) did backstage fansupport today, the organiser wanted them to prepare 300 boxes of each food/drink items. Even though the food items in the end was less than 300 per food item, but EXO didnt get to eat any of them.

* Minseoks tieba still posted this on weibo: So who ate those food? 

http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/005BXRi5gw1f2ao244h6jj30qo1beti3.jpg

* When fans want to set up tables outside the concert venue for fansupports, they need to pay 300yuan for 1 table, but as they will usually need at least 2 tables, that would be 600yuan. Also, a tent cover is needed since it was so sunny, another 300yuan was needed. (And these are just the booth fees, rental fees arent included yet.)
 




The security still said that Jongin (KAI) is a cripple and the security also said that EXO-Ls are fans of a bunch of gays

2016,2016-3-28,2016,3,28,1,4c64ni,All companies are now required to decide to produce either only boy groups or only girl groups. Which decision do you think _____ company should make?,oni_bear,1459095993,"**JYP:** Girl groups. JYP is very good at forming groups that attract a lot of popularity in its initial stages. He's even better at creating that one shining member who garners a lot of media attention (Sohee and Suzy). Also, I feel like the songs he produces are much stronger for girl groups compared to boy groups in his company. 

**SM:** This is a tough one. SM is very good at building a solid fan base for both girl and boy groups. Ultimately, I think I favor the girl group side a bit more. I feel like SM really shines with their ability to come up with different concepts (Red Velvet) and music (f(x) 4 Wall's vs Red Velvet's Ballad Album) with their girl groups. I think SM tends to be more out of the box with their girl groups. 

**YG:** Boy groups. Big Bang is sort of self explanatory. I felt YG was always stronger with their boy groups. While 2NE1 is no joke, YG sort of falls flat with his management of other female artists in his company (Lee Hi).Overall, I think the boy groups are much stronger in YG. 

Other companies to consider: Pledis, FNC, TS Entertainment, Loen, Mystic Entertainment, etc. ",53,2

For example, in Red Velvet, Seulgi and Wendy's voices go very well together, especially in 'Automatic' and 'Be Natural - Seulgi's very well balanced and Wendy has a richer voice that works perfectly. Same with Jimin's higher voice and Jungkook's more mellow tone in BTS.

As an aside, it seems like groups with stronger vocalists don't really combine as well in my opinion. I love Super Junior and I think they have one of, if not the, best vocal lines in K-pop but Yesung, Ryeowook, and Kyuhyun all have very distinct voices that are extremely different and it doesnt go as smoothly together.

Usually a group releases a song and, if it makes it big, then they (generally) go on to maintain that tempo, if only for one more release.

So, here I am, asking you, fellow r/kpop k-poppers; in your humble opinion, who is the ultimate kpop one hit wonder?

I wanted to start a discussion about what has been your favorite lead single, album, and music video so far?  I've thought a lot about this and for me they are as follows:

Single: Ladies' Code - Galaxy  My god what a comeback.  This song is everything I like, mysterious and emotional and completely captivating.  The lyrics are really thought provoking and their vocals gave me chills.  It's haunting and beautiful.

Album: Mamamoo - Melting.  I became a big fan of Mamamoo last year with Pink Funky so I was eagerly anticipating their first full album and they did not disappoint.  I think Melting is a really cohesive album in that it shows the many sides of Mamamoo's personality.  The songs are sexy and fun and show off their vocal abilities we've all come to admire and still has a splash of that retro throwback sound.

Music Video: [Winner Sentimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV9NJGTLm-4)  I really love the bird's eye view camera angle as well as the overall styling and color schemes.  I was absolutely floored by this music video (and this comeback in general).

(I hope this is ok to post, I'd love to hear what every one has enjoyed so far this year and hopefully people can find some new releases they haven't heard yet!)

**UPDATE WITH HANDY CHARTS!**

So I tallied up everyone's votes in the past 24 hours (since people just wrote kind of whatever they wanted I took every song mentioned as a vote and put choreography in with music video).  [Here's a few graphs of favorite song, album, and music video](http://imgur.com/a/NTxsk).

I'll be trying to keep up with this like I do with King of the Masked Singer.

**Show Format:**

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated.

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)
