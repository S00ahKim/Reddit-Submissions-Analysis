#### Annual K-Pop Awards

It is time once again for the [Annual K-Pop Awards!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/annualkpopawards)  To prepare for this year's awards, we wanted to present our ideas and changes to you guys for feedback before we get started.

##### Format &amp; Schedule

**First Change:**  In the past, nominations were made on a special subreddit (/r/annualkpopawards) and the winners were determined by upvotes in those threads.  Upvotes are a terrible way to choose winners, so this year we want to split the nomination and voting process.  Nominations will still occur on /r/annualkpopawards as before, but upvotes will only choose the nominees.  The top 5 upvoted nominees in each category will advance to a separate voting stage on Google Forms, which is a more controlled voting environment.

**Second Change:**  We will be limiting nominations to one per group per category.  You can still nominate multiple entries from the same group, but if two or more nominations are in the top five, only the highest voted entry will be nominated.  The rest will be skipped.  We know how much you guys love certain groups on this subreddit, but we want the votes to have a diverse selection.  In other words, we don't want the final five for ""Song of the Year"" to have three songs from Group A and two songs from Group B.  We think it would be better to have one song from five different groups in that vote.

**Schedule:**

* December 1: Feedback on format and categories.  The thread you're looking at right now!
* December 11: Nominations begin on /r/annualkpopawards.
* December 26: Voting begins on Google Forms.
* January 12: Winners announced on r/kpop.

##### Voting Categories

The last few years there have been 43 different voting categories.  We feel that is way too many and bloats the awards.  So this year, we'd like to trim the fat and narrow the list a bit.  We'd like to get your feedback on the list that we've come up with.

Overall Awards | Artist Awards | Performance Awards | Genre Awards |
:--|:--|:--|:--
Song of The Year | Best Female Soloist | Best Live Performance | Best Rock Song |
Album of The Year | Best Male Soloist | Best Live Vocal Performance - Solo | Best Rock Artist |
Music Video of The Year | Best Female Duo/Group | Best Live Vocal Performance - Duo/Group | Best Rap Song |
Producer of The Year | Best Male Duo/Group | Best Choreography - Solo | Best Rap Artist |
OST Song of The Year | Best Co-Ed Duo/Group | Best Choreography - Female Duo/Group | Best R&amp;B Song |
Best Album Cover Art | Best New Artist - Soloist | Best Choreography - Male Duo/Group | Best R&amp;B Artist |
Best Teaser | Best New Aritist - Female Duo/Group | Best Collaboration | Best Ballad - Solo |
Best Song Cover | Best New Artist - Male Duo/Group | | Best Ballad - Duo/Group |

You can [view last year's categories here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/annualkpopawards/2016)  We've cut the number down to 31 and would like to keep it at or close to that.  We understand that some of the categories we cut or combined definitely have merit, but we feel those were the best categories to cut, either because they are too similar to other categories or have a very small sample of choices.  If you feel strongly that we've cut the wrong categories, please let us know and suggest alternative cuts.  One area we'd like feedback on is the Genre Awards.  Would you rather select the Best Artist in the genre categories or the Best Album?  We've also added two new categories: Best Teaser and Best Song Cover.  These are a couple of fun categories that are big parts of the r/kpop subreddit, so we thought it would be cool to choose the best one.  If you have other ideas for new categories, let's hear them.  But remember, we need to keep the number down to avoid the bloat we had before.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Discouraging Downvotes

You guys have had some great feedback about trying to reduce the number of comment downvotes on the subreddit.  Today, we are implementing two new features we hope will accomplish that.  First, when your mouse touches the downvote button, you will see a new popup that says ""This comment is off-topic"".  We hope this message will remind folks what the downvote is supposed to be used for.  There are also a couple of new reminders in the comment box that disappear when you click on it.  You can check that out at the bottom of this post.  Unfortunately, these changes only affect desktop users.  Mobile users will not see these additions.  If we want to have meaningful discussions on this subreddit, then it's important that we don't drown out different opinions with downvotes.  Let us know what you think of these changes and if you have any other ideas that could help us keep the subreddit a great place to have in-depth discussions and disagreements about K-Pop.

&amp;nbsp;

#### YouTube Views Revisited

It's been almost a year since we limited YouTube Views posts to milestones of 100 million increments.  In most months, we have less than five of these posts, but lately, there has been a rise in them.  Should we make changes to this rule, or is it fine the way it is?  Is it still a big deal for a video to hit 100 or 200 million views?  Should we change the milestones to new numbers?  Should we limit it to only the first time a group reaches these milestones?  Should we just get rid of them entirely?  Let us know how you feel about these types of posts and what, if any, changes you'd like to see regarding them.

&amp;nbsp;


#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",90,34,False,self,,,,,

I am not trying to bash anyone or side with anyone. The entire point of this post is to clarify some misunderstandings. Leave your biased opinions elsewhere.



As some of us know, Mnet apparently has [blurred BP's faces out on the MAMA awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7gvwn7/mnet_blurred_out_blackpinks_faces_in_red_during/)


But I think some of us are getting confused by camera problems. 

There are two issues at work here:

*Encoding/Compression, and

*Recording a LED screen on a camera

Encoding/Compression:

[There is a phenomenon called encoding.](https://youtu.be/r6Rp-uo6HmI?t=5s)

When camera footage is being encoded when they are transferred to different platforms, specific objects in the video can ruin the quality of the video. 

Basically what happens is that the video encoder has to show the extra fine dots moving around. In this case, the pixels moving on the giant screen on the MAMA Stage. [You see them above BP's photos?](https://imgur.com/a/keYVU)

What this does is blends similar-looking objects together. You can see this effect in action from [a snip of the demonstration video] (https://imgur.com/a/bzjsg)


Things that can be blended easily together include objects that are very similar in color.

Comparing the Girl Group profile photos used on the MAMA stage (These photos are completely unaltered), [it doesn't take a lot to see that BP's was the only one with a heavy gradient](https://imgur.com/a/9BBow)

Looking at a [fancam angle](https://twitter.com/sewoonhk/status/936628052150312971), we can see that the other Girl Groups also received damage from encoding problems(again, unaltered screenshots):

*[Gfriend](https://imgur.com/a/5KLhC)

*[Red Velveet](https://imgur.com/a/nul3Z)

*[Twice](https://imgur.com/a/jlC4q)

*[BP](https://imgur.com/a/19Gpf)

LED:

When you record a LED screen on a camera, images tend to be overexposed. I don't have to explain this, anyone who's tried to record a television/computer screen on a phone will know what I'm talking about. 

To FURTHER VERIFY THIS and confirm that I'm not just spewing cow crap, I went ahead and used a well-known image encoder: [""Needs more JPEG""](http://needsmorejpeg.com/)  and used images that * I SATURATED SIMILARLY TO HOW THEY ARE ON THE LED SCREEN STAGE*

[Here are the results] (https://imgur.com/a/OAScp)

I hope you can see how various effects and camera angles on stage can destroy an image from a certain view, but let's not start theories off of it. And oh God don't you dare call me biased I swear to God I really really tried to be unbiased. Even though I stan RV and Loona I am also a huge fan of Jisoo so don't you dare call me biased.

But then last year EXO-CBX formed and gave me the absolute banger of the year, [Hey Mama](https://youtu.be/AOzVyVv1HtQ) and i realized this sub-unit is a really good idea because it gave Xiumin and Chen a chance to show their prowess, which usually isn't as prominently displayed in other exo songs because of power vocals like kyungsoo and baekhyun as well as having to fit in the rappers.

Triple H's [365 Fresh](https://youtu.be/8gPQenyj1nI) was also surprisingly good because i wasn't expecting much from the co-ed group even though i love hyuna and pentagon so i was really impressed by how catchy and fun the song was!

I guess sub-units give idols a chance to explore new  styles and concepts beyond their usual group and so i've really come to appreciate and look forward to them. What are some sub units you enjoy following or listening to? ",126,152,False,self,,,,,

Why are the songs this week so cold? Is it because theyre so beautiful? Will you call their name? Find out this week! Here are this weeks songs:

New to Jukebox or want a refresher on the rules? Here you go, read here! Leave your review for the song and a score between 1 and 10 as a reply to the comment with the song title and artist(s) name. Try to leave an 80-word review or so and be thoughtful, but also feel free to be creative and fun as well! Feel free to review one or all seven of the songs here: these Jukebox threads are your space to leave your thoughts on songs and whether you like or dislike them. If theres an [MV] tag in front of the song, youre free to review the MV as well, but thats optional and totally up to you!

As a reminder, I dont pick the songs that appear unless I specifically state I did (like last week for Peek-A-Boo), and I didnt pick any of the songs this week: all songs are randomly generated using random.org/lists. I will post screenshots of this in the ""Other Business"" section.

Closer is still holding onto its spot in the Top 10 for two months strong now! Meanwhile BTOB has entered as our #5 most-liked song! No surprise either; Im not a BTOB fan myself but I think Movie is easily one of the best songs I have ever heard this year. Yay! Now there's more than one boy group up there haha.

Thats all for now! Did you think GFriend Crushed it? Will you call CLC by their name? Do you think Monsta X is so Beautiful?  Find out and listen to this weeks songs! Have fun reviewing, thanks for participating, enjoy the weekend, and have a *fantasy*tic week! ",41,25,False,self,,,,,

Here are the songs released in the last two weeks that have had less than 10 comments (not including replies) on this sub. This is for groups that are considered nugu on this sub, not in Korea.

We had a lot of debuts this month, particularly girl groups, that didn't get much attention.

If you're a fan of any of these groups/soloists, tell us about them. Why do you like them, who are the members etc.

**If there are any issues/suggestions please reply to the comment I will post.**

Now, let's spread love to these Nugus.

I think there's a lot of heartwarming stories out there that are cross-fandom or even inside a single fandom that can show how thoughtful and kind fans can be.

My example is from when I went to EXOrdium in Seoul. Back then my Korean was passable but I was obviously a foreigner. I went to the concert venue early to collect free fanmade goods and I saw a girl wearing an earring/lip ring that looked like Baekhyun's in the Monster MV. I approached her and asked in my broken Korean where she got it, and she actually pulled out her phone and explained to me in broken English which Twitter user she bought it from and when that Twitter user was going to arrive at the venue to sell more of them. She was also gorgeous so I kind of fell in love with her that day lol.

Later during the concert there was an empty seat next to me and a girl JUMPED into it from a few rows back. She asked me who my bias was (Baekhyun) and kind of started a conversation. Throughout the concert she got REALLY HYPED even though she came alone and she would tap me on the arm every time Baekhyun said something or sang or anything, as if to remind me that he was my bias haha. Somehow, I was lucky enough to be at the concert for the first time that Baekhyun ever took his shirt off. The girl next to me probably squeezed the life out of my arm and we were looking at each other and screaming. She really made my experience so fun because even though the members talked too fast for me to understand, she would always tap me when it was Baekhyun's turn to speak and she would laugh and kind of direct me for when to laugh lol.

If you have a nice, positive story, please share! I really like reading this kind of stuff :)",83,187,False,self,,,,,

[171201 G.O Daum Caf Chat](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7c5a1c_5b135ab399ec45c3968bba690ffe4ae0.pdf)

&gt; 2 staff members. There are about 120 available seats. But there are international fans too, so I
should discuss about it with staff.

&gt; Program is not yet decided because I am planning this whole thing by
myself without a script/scriptwriter. So it might not be fun.
It could be only talking.
And on the fan meeting day, if there is someone who can take a movie and can edit
the movie, Ill send some gift. No guards, no MC. I think we dont need any guards. We are not uncivilized people.
And do not take some food inside the hall.
They do not allow. (Venue)

&gt; No age limit. Ill talk about the last 2 years and the plan for my future.

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Anything else is fair game, no matter how trivial or silly.  Remember, you can ask your K-pop questions any day of the week over at r/kpophelp.

* This is the fifthteenth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* **You can suggest only 3 songs.**
* **Each song has to be of a different group/artist.**
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Winter/Holiday**! (yes i know it was suppose to be sub units but it is the first Tuesday of December so i decided to change it.)

* Any song from a group/soloist that is for the holiday season or has that holiday feel.

Here are my contributions -

* [EXO - Sing For You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqaSboKBIuA)
* [GOT7 - Confession Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aG4E5jJKtQ)

Winter/Holiday playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdtCespV-BNcBt0e1xnKTf4E)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

(What events or music made 2017 stand out). This is based solely on subjective opinion and can be potentially different from others. Please respect ones opinion in a civil manner**

*For Example:*



**1st: Revival of Nuest**
They suffered a tremendous amount of pain when applying to Produce 101. Humbling and having to lose their pride as a senior in a competition is not easy for one to do. It is still amazing to witness how much growth and popularity they garnered after the show. I hope next year, they continue to grow with more love and support .

**2nd: Globalization of BTS**
Witnessing BTS on American shows with so much love and support from international fans is such a tear-jerker. From winning the social award to performing in american music awards, BTS still kept being humble and present their music with their message towards fans. Its nice that their music can also incorporate in unicef campaigns about loving yourself.

**3rd: Legendary Idol Girl Group Disbandment**
Still cant believe 2ne1, sistar and Wonder Girls disbanded. Thank you for making bops and great music that i will still play eternally and never forget. Im still crying over Sistars Goodbye stage (Im happy they at least had one) and Lonely Performance. The songs they have performed are so beautiful  I wish luck for the groups future activities

**4th: Wanna One (Produce 101 Season 2)**
I still cant believe how 11 members can manage to shine individually. Theyre so talented and unique and Im happy with the results. Also Post-Groups of PD101 is a beautiful thing to witness. JBJ + RAINZ are groups that i also look forward to.

**5th: Modern Matured Sound**
Most boy groups that i stan sounds more cohesive and chill-tropical beat based. Anyways, Im digging toward the new signature sound that many groups have this year especially Exo, GOT7, BTS and more. I still cant believe in every comeback, they manage to create masterpieces.

**6th: Kards Actual Official Debut**
Im so happy that there is a co-ed group i can follow recently. Kards Music never fails to disappoint me and i hope that DSP can utilize their potential to the max.

**7th: First Monsta X Win**
I cant believe they come this far. They are truly underrated but now Im glad theres more support and love coming from fans. Witnessing them crying is such a tear-jerker moment because these poor angels always blame theirselves. I hope them for more luck and support next year too

**Currently Active Projects:** (in order based on project end date - given in KST)
	
**[015B Remake Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_015b/)**

* Date Project Ends: December 21, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is 015B?

015B is a Gen 1 duo (formerly a group) signed to MCC Entertainment. Not much as been written about them in English, but they initially debuted in 1990 as an actual band with 4 members. However, the group seems to have disbanded in 1996. In 2006, the group was revived via two of the founding members, and has promoted as a duo under the groups name ever since. Most of their current work features guest vocalists. 

**[Apple.B Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_appleb/)**

* Date Project End: December 28, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Apple.B?

Apple.B is a very new group, having debuted August 1, 2017 with the song [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivFyyllBSE)"". Like B.I.G, they are also signed to GH Entertainment. The group consists of 5 members, and seems to be going with a cheerleading style concept if their Makestar page is any indication. Besides their personality quirks and basic info on each member (the standard age, position, blood type), nothing else of note has really been written about them in English. 

Recently, members Sandy, Yooji, and Haeun auditioned for *The Unit* with a frankly [disastrous performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tftd9jHQGWk) of Red Velvets Dumb Dumb, and only Sandy and Yooji made it through the audition rounds. Yooji is currently ranked #55 and Sandy is #56 out of 63 female contestants. 

The project was initially slated to end on November 13, but was given an extension by Makestar.


**[S.I.S Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sis/)**

* Date Project Ends: December 28, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is S.I.S?

So there actually isnt too much written about them in English, but [relevant wikia](http://kpop.wikia.com/wiki/S.I.S) page.

From what little I could gleam from the internet, S.I.S (which stands for Serendipity in Stars) is a six member girl group signed to XX Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Ive Got a Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwx68Z99uk)"". According to their Makestar, the groups image is going for a little sister vibe.

They do have a pretty active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sis6girls/) page.


**[14U New Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_14u/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is 14U?

14U (pronounced One For You) is a 14 member boy group from BG Entertainment. The group is actually made up in two subunits (think EXO K/M), one being 14U-X (the ""masculine charisma"" subunit) and 14U-L (the ""cute friendly charms"" subunit) with 7 members in each subunit - though they are currently promoting as a whole team. The group debuted in July with the song ""[VVV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b83iEHH_UTU),"" but were soon dragged into a controversy when member Doyool was falsely accused of ""dissing"" Kyungsoo of EXO. It was soon revealed that this post was actually from an impersonator account and BG is currently taking legal action against the impersonator.

Since the groups Makestar project began, BG Ent. has been updating fans about what the groups been up to via the Makestar page. Seems the groups been promoting in Japan recently. 

**[April Special Photobook Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_april/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is April?

April is a group who is decently known on the sub, so Ill link the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_(band\)) page if you guys want more info.

But short version is: April is a six-member group group that is signed to DSP Media (former home to KARA, Sechskies, and Rainbow and current home to KARD and A-Jax). The group debuted in 2015 with the song [Dream Candy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2T1yZbTMzo) and has sort of become known more because of their member changes than their actual music. 

Former member Somin debuted in DSPs Japanese group Puretty in 2012 with future April member Chaekyung, but the group disbanded in 2014. Both girls (along with debuting April member Chaewon) later participated in the *KARA Project* when KARA was undergoing a lineup change, though they did not win the slot (Heo Youngji did).  Somin left April soon after the group debuted, and would eventually re-debut in the co-ed group KARD. Former member Hyunjoo left a year into the groups debut due to health issues, and is currently appearing on the survival show *The Unit.* 

Before joining April, current member Chaekyung appeared on *Produce 101* after not winning the KARA slot, eventually placing 16th in the show. On the show, her most notable performance was in the song [At the Same Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1NbzOE4HTQ)"" on Team Girls on Top which included future IOI members Doyeon, Sohye, and Yeonjung and future soloist Kim Sohee. She would later debut with Kim Sohee in the project groups IBI and C.I.V.A.

The most notorious former member of April was Sawori. For a time, she was the most popular member of the group, but then it got revealed that not only did she have an [iljin past](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/05/29/saworis-rise-to-stardom-has-led-to-special-treatment-her-iljin-attitudes-exposed/) but her diva-like attitude caused her to [be bullied](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/05/31/shocking-video-of-sawori-being-bullied-by-april-members-revealed/) by the other April members. She left the group soon after the group's promotions for *Spring* ended.

Their current image is essentially like a young Apink. The groups most notable songs include [April Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWRyggt-QY), [Lovesick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWkkcRpLam0)"", and [Jelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHVtMV6XpQE)"".

**[P.O.P New Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_pop/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 3, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is P.O.P?

P.O.P is also a very new girl group, having debuted July 26 with the song [Catch You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZM7mmDKQQ). The group has currently has five members (though they debuted with 6) and is signed to DWM Entertainment Company. The group is co-managed by Rainbow Bridge Works, the label of Mamamoo and Vromance. Member Yeonha, who entered a hiatus shortly after the group debuted, [officially left the group on October 24](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/78c1v0/pops_yeonha_will_be_leaving_the_group_in_regards/) due to continuing health problems. Although not much has been written about them in English, they have an active [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQ_3LxyLJ8Z9C5s1GdlF4g/videos?pbjreload=10). 

The project was initially slated to end on November 20, but was given an extension by Makestar.


**[B.A.P Limited Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_bap2/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 3, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is B.A.P?

B.A.P (which stands for Best Absolute Perfect) is decently known on the sub, so Ill link the [long wikipeida page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.P_(South_Korean_band/) for more info. Ill just give a brief summary below.

B.A.P is a six-member boy group under TS Entertainment. The group debuted in 2012 with the song [Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tLooPlf2Sw). However, two years after the groups debut, they sued their label to nullify their contract, claiming unfair working conditions and profit distribution. One of their most starling claims were that of the $9 million USD the group had earned since their debut, each member had only been paid a total of $18,000 USD. This lawsuit would last for a year, in which both parties would eventually settle out of court, with B.A.P staying with TS and TS assumedly paying out more to the boys.

While the groups year long hiatus due to the lawsuit hurt the groups popularity, they are still doing relatively well. Each of their post-lawsuit full length and mini albums have sold at least 50,000+ copies (via Gaon). The groups most recent release (the single album Blue) came out in September this year. Their fandom name is BABYZ.


**[Sonamoo Album Project Part 2](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sonamoo2/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 18, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Sonamoo?

Like B.A.P, Sonamoo is decently known on the sub, so Ill direct people to the groups [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonamoo) for a more in depth look at who they are. Ill give a brief summary below.

Sonamoo is a seven-member girl group under TS Entertainment (making them labelmates of B.A.P). The group debuted in 2014 with the song [Dj vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRY0Dk9avck), which showcased the groups initial image of chic tough girls (ala 2NE1). However, in 2016 the group underwent a complete concept change with the release of [I Like U Too Much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YmVUjBB6Hc), which had the girls embrace the girl next door image. The group has been sticking to this concept ever since.

Member Eunjin auditioned for *The Unit*, performing a remixed version of Hyunas ""[Bubble Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWjNTUIDi54)"", where she passed the auditions rounds. She is currently ranked 2nd out of 63 female contestants. 

The group's fandom name is Solbangul (), which means pine cone. This is super cute because Sonamoo () actually means pine tree in Korean. So it's like the fans are the pine cones in the group's pine tree.

**[We Girls Debut Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_wegirls/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 24, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is We Girls?

I literally have not been able to find anything in English about this group outside of their Makestar page. They have an active [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wegirls7) page though.

From what I could take from their Makestar, We Girls is a nine member group signed to Aftermoon co. From what someone posted on the sub, one of the members Ji Na (written as Jaina on the Makestar page), is a former member of Bob Girls. 

Doing something completely different from other debut projects, Aftermoon is allowing Starmakers to vote on who becomes the groups center and leader. As of December 6, member Vivian is winning though Hyeny is close behind.

**[Mckay Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sonamoo2/)**

* Date Project Ends: February 7, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Mckay?

Mckay Kim is a singer-songwriter from San Diego, California. He is most well known for appearing on K-pop Star Season 2 in 2012, where he was placed in the team Raccoon Boys. The team ended up placing 5th in the competition, and he eventually signed to Dorothy Company. However, he is currently signed to U.P. Music.

He officially debuted in 2015, with the single [Angel 2 Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c64vgmNlq84), featuring Filipino-American singer Jeff Bernat.

I cant really find too much else about him, but it seems he hasnt had a proper comeback since 2015. His last single was the song [Month of June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krHshoFGpf4)"".",7,28,False,self,,,,,

This is your time to make guesses on things to happen next year in K-pop, whether they be very obvious, or completely crazy! I'll start off with some of my own: 

- LOONA does something massive for their full 12-member group debut

- Another group starts to get a lot of playtime in the US, much like BTS currently, maybe Twice?

- KARD releases another song completely in English

- One of the SNSD members that left SM Entertainment gets spotted with Jessica

- Jeon Somi debuts finally

- Blackpink releases a full album (I'm feeling ambitious)

- Someone leaves Girl's Day

- Berry Good split up

- WJSN have 3 comebacks

- Dreamcatcher has an on-stage collab with a band group like Marmello/Day6/CNBlue where their music is performed live

- Comeback of NCT U and debut of a brand new unit

and for the 4th year in a row

- SMTOWN comes to Toronto ",400,235,False,self,,,,,

Here's an update for those albums that have additional sales since the last thread.  I've also added a new column for when the last numbers were taken.  The previous post had the most recent numbers from 170930.  If you have more recent numbers than those below, feel free to post them in the comments.

If more recent numbers have come out with multiple versions of albums combined, I've removed the individual sales in favor of the most recent sales.

https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5gvgys/2017_kpop_predictions_thread/

As for myself, I failed pretty badly with my predictions!:

- SNSD does something huge and different for their 10th anniversary comeback. **If by huge and different you mean SM flopped on them hard and they split up :(**

- Seohyun gets her solo, but we also see the solo debut of Sunny. **Seohyun started the year with her solo, but nothing from Sunny aside from a Station release with Henry**

- CL releases a full album in the US. **Still waiting on it**

- Luna releases a 2nd album. **I swore this was coming, but I guess not yet either**

- After School splits up :( **Even worse, we got little to no news on them at all**

- Apink does a sexy concept. **This didn't happen either**

- EXO debuts another subunit. **No new subunit, but they are doing stuff in Japan**

- Gfriend comes back in January and July. **This was based on the last 2 years, but sadly they released music in March and August this year**

- Twice comes back in May and November. **Signal was in May...Likey was on October 30th so I'm gonna go ahead and count this one for being close enough!!** 

- IOI does a surprise world tour before splitting. **Wishful thinking :(**

- LOONA showcases all 12 members and their group debut is super popular. **Ahh back when we thought it would be over with in a year, but I'm actually really glad we're getting this much hype with the pre-debut**

- Mamamoo releases a song all in English. **Nope**

- 2 more NCT units debut. **NOPE, but I think that was partially to do with the Korea-China relations**


- Secret returns with 3 members. **Nothing at all...as you can see by my flair**

- Oh My Girl will perform at KCON in the US. **I was hoping for NY which I was at, but they did make a special appearance at LA so I did get this one**

- An Ex-member of Rainbow will release a solo track. **Yay one I was solidly correct about, [Jisook released a solo song with Ilhoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kPxlLLZOH0)**

- Kangin leaves Super Junior **Not officially, but it might actually happen**

- Someone leaves Hello Venus **Thankfully, this didn't happen**

- Nayoung, Pinky, Doyeon, Yoojung, Chungha, and Somi will debut in groups; Sohye will get acting roles in a drama or two. **Yes for Nayoung, Pinky, Doyeon and Yoojung. Chungha debuted but not in a group. Somi kind of was in some groups but nothing permanent yet. Sohye did get some cameo drama appearances. All in all, I got this half right**

- SMTown comes to Toronto (I've put this on here for 3 years now. Gotta happen sooner or later.) **Not yet not yet not yet**

How did you all do, /r/kpop?

This month's theme is **""Fantastic Features""**!

Some of the best songs out there feature artists that are not traditionally part of the K-Pop scene.  Share your favorite songs featuring artists that are **not idols**.  The feature must be _vocals_, can't just be a featuring producer. For this theme, songs **must be at least 1 year old.**

If you want me to add a group to this list that I've missed, please comment their name, disband date and reason and I'll add them. 

What group disbandment are you most sad about and why? Who do you predict is next in the merciless disbandment cycle of the Kpop industry? Anything else I could add to the disbanding reasons column?

Group|Disband Date|Reason for Disbanding
:--|:--|:--|:--
2AM|22nd of September|Changmin, Seulong and Jinwoon all broke their contracts with JYP back in 2015, leaving just Jo Kwon. Despite JYP assuring fans 2AM was not disbanding, Jo Kwon left JYP this year, thus ending the group.
Chocolat|Sometime in February|The girl group had been inactive since 2013.Former member Melanie stated in an [interview with Kpopalypse](https://kpopalypse.com/2017/04/15/kpopalypse-interview-melanie-lee-ex-chocolat/) that the group's contract had ended in February.
D.Holic|~July|After many lineup changes, all the members of the group except Rena left, leading to an informal disbandment. 
History|12th of May|All the members signed solo contracts, so I suppose Loen just decided that they weren't successful enough as a group and disbanded them.
I.B.I|They just kinda stopped|I.B.I was always intended to be temporary, so with the disbandment of I.O.I, the girls returned to their original companies.
INX|December|Shitty company
I.O.I|31st of January|I.O.I was a temporary group, so after their contract expired, the girls returned to their agencies/permanent groups.
Leessang|6th of April|The duo had been fairly inactive since 2015. The company never stated anything, but it can be assumed the two have gone their separate ways since they have both started their own music labels.
M.I.B|4th of January|???
Sistar|4th of June|The girls decided it was time to go their separate ways TT.
Spica|6th of February|The group were fairly nugu and had had periods of long inactivity leading to their disbandment.
The Legend|May|The group filed a lawsuit against their company because it was a piece of shit. They won! The lawsuit terminated their contracts and they all departed from the company.
Unicorn|5th of September|Rumi announced on her Instagram that the girls had disbanded. This was probably due to financial issues.
Wonder Girls|26th of January|Yeeun and Sunmi had decided to leave JYP Entertainment, leaving Yubin and Hyerim. The group then disbanded.",95,218,False,self,,,,,

The company was started by an ambitious photographer whose original interests didnt even include k-pop or pop culture in general. Taking a massive risk, the founder hastily assembled a nugu group known later as Crayon Pop. Couple of songs were released but they mostly attracted attention of fans specifically interested in checking out k-pop scene newcomers. No wonders though  marketing efforts were abysmal, fandom consisted mostly of older males, they had troubles getting into music shows. Guerrilla performances were being held, and whilst a cool concept in itself, they werent a long-term solution to problems Chrome were facing.

Then Bar Bar Bar happened.

I hold a special place in my heart for this song because BBB introduced me to k-pop. It was a massive hit that went viral globally. Everybody copied the five pistons dance, flash mobs were being organized, Ellen DeGeneres showed BBB to the American audience, CEO of YG Ent. openly praised the song, heck, even bloody Tom Hiddleston danced it on SNL. The timing was perfect  almost exactly the year before Psy showed the world Gangnam Style. He then followed up with Gentleman, which also attracted global attention. The next in line? Bar Bar Bar.

The song got dubbed as just as silly and quirky as Gangnam Style and the next summer hit from Korea, quotes I pulled out of my ~~ass~~ memory. It earned Chrome a Sony partnership and a whole bunch of money they promptly wasted  but Ill talk about this later. What matters now is that they attracted a big fandom that was hungry of more crayons and waiting in never-ending anticipation for their next move. The sensible thing to do at this point is to release some new material, right?

Well, yeah. But Chromes CEO inexperience showed big time.

Bar Bar Bar got featured on music shows for two whole months. Everybody knew they dont really have any new material because the songs success hit them by surprise, so while the overexposure got a little bit annoying over time, the consensus was that its better worth the wait.

And then, after finishing the music shows tour, Chrome released Bar Bar Bar (Global Version).

Nobody asked for it. The MV sucked. The song got remixed. Steve Aoki gave Mic Drop new soul with his remix, Chrome Entertainment gave BBB an electric guitar track. But well oh well  they're new in the game, so surely they will move on from Bar Bar Bar, work on something new and listen to fandoms demands?

Sucks to be you. Their next move was to release Bar Bar Bar 2.0, which was the said remix from Global Version. At this point people were pissed. BBB was released in June and here we are in October with no end of this blatant milking in sight. It was clear they wouldnt have anything new in time for MAMA (December event) but at the same time Mnet couldnt neglect the biggest hit of the summer, so they got cramped together with Ylvis and called it a day.

The fandom shrunk significantly. Those who stayed waited for the debut of Chromes first male group: K-Much. We got to hear their debut song in January and we got really excited, so this time they wouldnt screw things up, would they?

You guessed it. It was a Bar Bar Bar reskin. Over half a year of milking.

After the outrage Chrome started to try new things. They debuted Bob Girls  the gimmick was that all the members wore bob cuts. Silly, but after all Crayon Pop made it big with a silly concept. Male duo called Zan Zan debuted. I think they were rapping. Im not quite sure though, because I dont recall a single song of theirs other than their debut ballad. While trying to diversify their product, they forgot about Crayon Pop  the single reason why people were following Chromes activities in the first place.

We heard Uh-ee in April 2014. It was simply too late. The song was good, the MV was silly in a different way than BBB, but we had to endure BBBs overexposure, get disappointed by the new groups and finally wait almost a whole year for new material.

It all plummeted. Zan Zan and Bob Girls disbanded, K-Much didnt have much to do, fresh material was being put out too sparingly (another year of waiting for FM). We then got Doo Doom Chit (after another year, of course), Soyul got knocked up, Crayon Pop went on a semi-hiatus that in their case means de facto disbandment. Chrome Entertainments story might as well end at this point  K-Much dont have any drawing power, Chrome executives dont have the necessary experience, their biggest group silently dissolved.

You simply cant expect people to have this much patience. Chrome overestimated how long can you ride on a wave of popularity. At the end we all just got pissed, then bored, then disinterested. Its not unheard of to have one-hit wonder groups but I think Chromes case of shooting themselves in the foot over and over makes it especially noteworthy.

Chrome did some things right, of course. They showed the world that group members dont really have to go through the extensive training period on slave contracts. Videoblogging daily activities of idols got popularized by Crayon Pop TV. They broke many unwritten taboos, such as incorporating kicking in choreography. However, their inability to stay on the top made their impact on the k-pop industry null and void.

Yesterday i went to Dreamcatcher Showcase in Brazil so i'm here to share my experience:


**1st Song: Fly High** - Dreamcatcher started the show with Fly High, the staff gave us purple balloons so we could use them to cheer during Fly High after the song we threw them. 
Ok, Fly High is my favorite Dreamcatcher song, so this was the moment that i was expecting the most, i even knew the fanchant... [This crazy guy fanchanting their names ""JiU SuA Siyeon, Handong, Yoohyeon, Dami, Ga~Hyeon](https://youtu.be/aCqlCbgcwxE?t=165) it's me xD]

**2nd Song: Chase Me** - After Fly High they started Chase Me right away, after Chase Me they did the group intro and individuals intros, after that the girls went backstage and they had put ""Chase Me and Good Night MV Behind"" videos on the big screen

**3rd and 4th Songs: Trust Me and Lullaby**  - After the girls returned from the short break, they sang those 2 ballads.


After the ballads DC talked with the crowd and did some Aegyo ""Te amo nen"" (something like ""I love you baby"" in portuguese, all seven girls did it and it was so freaking cute to hear them speaking in portuguese

**5th and 6th Song: Sleep Walking and Lucky Strike (Og. Maroon 5)** - They perfomed Sleep Walking and right after Lucky Strike.

**7th Song: Into The New World (Og. SNSD)** - They talked with the crowd and JiU said that she heard us singing to ""Holiday - SNSD"" while we're waiting for the show to start, so she said they would sing a SNSD song, and they sang ITNW... this was a really magical moment for me, SNSD was the group that got me into Kpop, i already saw some videos of DC doing this cover, but i was watching it live, it was amazing

**Dance Cover: Believer (og. Imagine Dragons)** - They went backstage and they returned with a Dance Cover for this song of Imagine Dragons, Yoohyeon high kick slayed me

**9th Song - Just Give me a Reason (Og. P!nk)** - Sang by Yoohyeon, Dami, SuA and Gahyeon.

**10th Song: Sunday Morning (Og. Maroon 5)** - Sang by JiU, Handong and Siyeon

After those 2 songs that they divided the group to sing, they all returned together to the stage and said that they would sing a Brazilian song

**10th Song: Garota de Ipanema/Girl from Ipanema (Og. Tom Jobim)** - They sang half the song in portuguese and half of the song in english. It was really cool to see that they learned a portuguese song.

They went backstage again, returned and said that they would sing the last song:

**11th Song: Emotion** - They sang this ballad, and said goodbye.

after that they played on the big screen ""Fly High MV Behind and Jacket Shooting

**12th Song: Regrets of the times**- The girls came back running to the stage dancing and singing to Regrets of the Times, they grabbed the water bottles during the half of the song and started to play around, throwing water at themselves and on the crowd.

JiU said that they, now, would sing the really last song:

**13th Song: Good Night** - This was the last song of the showcase.


**High Touch Experience:** After the show i had the High Touch, everyone that bought had to make a line and wait a little bit to see the girls.

**Dami**: She was the first one on the line, when she saw me she charged a High Five (i'm a big fat tall guy), after that we hold hands and i said a few words to her, that i loved her and she said thanks

**Gahyeon**: The maknae was the second, we hold hands, she looked really happy and was all smiles, i said that i loved her and she said thank you.

**Yoohyeon**: Okay, now was to time to face my bias, i was stading in front of her i looked her in the eyes and said that i love her (in korean, english and portugues) and she replied back to me!! i couldn't believe Yoohyeon said she love me too, i was so happy to hear that

**JiU**: Her eyes was filled with tears, she was happy and almost crying, another one that said thanks to my saranghaeyo

**Siyeon**: Siyeon was really excited, you could see in her eyes, i said i loved her and she replied

**Handong**: I was saying the name of the girls as i stand in front of them, but instead of saying Handong i said ""DongDong"", her nickname, the moment after i called her DongDong, her, Siyeon (that was on her right) and SuA (that was on her left) looked amused at me, and the three smiled more, this moment was really special to me, they saw that i watch their stuff and videos.

**SuA**: was the last one, she was smilling a lot to me, especially after i said ""DongDong"" to Handong, i said saranghae to her, and she said thanks to. Them i started to walk away, and i looked behind and SuA was waving and sending hearts to me while the next person on the line was still on Siyeon.


I had the time of my life with this concert, i wanted to share with you guys!!

Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad english xD

**Edit:** I just realize that i forgot to say that after the dance cover of Believer, they choose two fans, a male and a female, that was wearing DC outfits and danced the chorus of ""Chase Me"" on the stage with them.",36,224,False,self,,,,,

**Location: ATT Showbox, Taipei**  
  
So, this was Lovelyz 1st visit to Taiwan and boy was this an amazing one that I've experienced. The showcase started promptly at 6pm local time. The girls performed to ""Destiny"" as their opening act, followed by Now, We.  
  
After which, they did self-introduction in Chinese! (Well, a line of basic self-introduction that is!). The host with the help of a very experienced translator (had seen her host other fanmeets before in Taiwan) proceeded to ask them several questions about their experience in Taiwan. And of course, the members started listing a number of popular food items in Taiwan! They also said that they spent the night before enjoying some food in their vehicle while travelling across the city to view the city's landscape at night after they are done with rehearsal.  
  
After which they performed Goodnight Like Yesterday, Amusement Park (Joyland). And then they had interaction with the fans by playing some games. Basically, there were 8 boxes on a table, each sealed with a Taiwanese food item behind. The members have to taste the food item individually and do a dance of the item. The screen behind them will show 2 food items each round, and 1 of it is the item the members had. Fans have to guess the food item correctly
to earn a chance to be selected upstage. For the first few rounds, they picked girls onstage and they win an autographed polaroid of the member + they offered to hug the participants.  
  
It was until Jiae's turn when she picked a male fan. The fan asked for a handshake after receiving her polaroid. And then when it was Mijoo's turn, a male fan went onstage, asked for a photo (which the emcee assisted them to take), after which, Mijoo hugged the fan. Similarly Jin also offered a hug to another male fan. They are just so sincere and nice. TTTTTT  
  
They then performed Candy Jelly Love, Shooting Star. We were then shown Twinkle MV and Behind the Scenes video of Twinkle onscreen. After which, they performed Fallin' and Triangle.  
  
An hour plus passed flew by and the emcee told the fans that the showcase will be ending soon. So they prepared for their group shot. And since Taiwanese fans have provided support slogan to be raised for them, I thought at this moment, the screen will show the fanmade video (since the members are facing the screen for the group picture). But I was proven wrong!  
  
The group phototaking ended and Lovelyz announced that they will be performing their last song - Twinkle. They took their position. And out of a sudden, it seems like a glitch when Candy Jelly Love MV started playing onscreen. Turns out, it was the opening scene of Taiwanese support fanmade video. Of course, the video was absolutely touching. All the members cried. Many fans were tearing up as well.  
  
Mijoo being one of the ""strongest"" (you know why I added """" later on) tried to hold back her tears. And she didn't cry as much. They calmed down and thanked the fans before performing Twinkle.  
  
They then went backstage as we await for an encore. Another support by Taiwanese fans were to sing along to Ah-Choo instead of cheering for ""encore, encore!"". So, some of the support members led the song. But instead of singing along to it, because the fanchant for ""Ah-Choo"" was to echo after ""Ah-Choo"" when it was sung. So, we ended up doing fanchant instead which resulted in laughter. They tried again the second time and the echo for ""Ah-Choo"" was even louder. This is pretty cute! Haha. So they gave up and shouted encore.  
  
Lovelyz came out and sang Ah-Choo as their final song as the showcase successfully came to an end. The members left to the backstage waving goodbyes and we have Mijoo standing at another end of the stage suddenly breaking out in tears. Like legit she suddenly crying really badly, when moments ago she was asking fans to not cry. Jisoo went to cheer her up, but for that good 1-2 minutes, Mijoo was just literally crying her hearts out. Jisoo and Jin led her backstage eventually.    
  
The showcase ended and a hi-touch session took place for all ticket holders. The members were super polite, and even repeatedly thanked the fans for attending the showcase. ",5,57,False,self,,,,,

Was feeling a bit nostalgic this morning and so went wondering when g.o.d will come back if ever again. Found the g.o.d special concert from back in 2014 from my Sketchbook folder and this topic came to mind. It's a fairly common one but I believe this isn't on the current stale topics lineup. 

So /r/kpop what are the most meaningful/important/favourite moments of Kpop?

Here are a few of mine to get things rolling:

* Back in 2014, ten years since they'd last promoted as 5 they held their comeback with Ugly Duckling and the stellar comeback concert on Yoo Hee Yeol's Sketchbook (ep.241 for those curious). Their opening with Ugly Duckling was emotional but their performance of [Lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik7Jp-84eB8) especially was emotional for me.

* I was only able to see this via fancam as I was unable to be in Korea during the duration of the tour, but [this performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geqkGm6YpCo) from Park Hyo Shin's 2014 tour is just heart-wrenching. Anyone who's followed Park Hyo Shin over the years knows just *how much* Wild Flower means to him and the fandom. It was truly the gift that re-connected the fans who'd waited so long and PHS.",93,91,False,self,,,,,

This is your chance to choose the best-of-the-best in K-Pop for 2017!  Before we get started, here's a quick overview of the format and rules for this year's awards.

1.  Nominations and voting will be two separate processes.  Today begins the nominations.  The top 5 most upvoted nominations in each category will advance to the voting round, which will begin the day after Christmas, December 26.

2.  Only nominate songs, albums, and performances from calendar year 2017 and artists that released new music in 2017.

3.  Include a link to the relevant song/MV/album/performance that you are nominating.

4.  Do not post commentary or comments about the nominations in the nomination thread.  If you want to discuss the nominations, use this thread.

5.  **Search before you nominate!** Duplicate nominations will be removed.

The nomination threads are in **contest mode**.  That means the scores are hidden and they are sorted in random order.

**Try to be objective.**  This is not the census.  It's not about voting for your favorites.  We want to choose the best of 2017.  Give props where they are due.  Nominate and upvote the entries that you feel are **most deserving** of the awards, not just your personal favs.

### [Nominations are now open on /r/annualkpopawards](https://www.reddit.com/r/annualkpopawards/new/)

Nominations will end on December 25th.  
Voting will begin on December 26th.  
Winners will be announced on January 12th.

There is a tie for 3rd Best track vote on the straw poll to decide which song is better

[Bad VS Back](http://www.strawpoll.me/14595523)


January 2nd we'll be voting on the Schedule for Feb-June. No re-dos will be allowed this time. 

A few users voiced some concerns and I decided that a minimum of 12 months needed to pass before a re-do but I wanted to let the subreddit decide if it should be longer than 12 months so I set up an instant runoff vote.   

http://www.demochoice.org/dcballot.php?poll=kpop2k17

All you need to do is rank the number of months you think should have to pass before a re-do. Your options are 12,18, 24, 30, 36 ,42, and 48 months. This is the most democratic way of deciding. The program takes all the #1 votes. If one of the choices has more than 50% of the vote it wins. If none of the choices have a majority, the choice with the least amount of #1 votes gets eliminated. The #2 votes for everyone that voted on the one that got eliminated now count as #1 votes. The program recounts the votes to see if any of the choices have a majority. If not it repeats the process.

Also, she recently sang her first OST called [Love Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX04obLHZsQ) for the drama Girls' Generation 1979 and it was beautiful!
Which member's part in some other songs stood out for you?

On the one hand, those kinds of videos and articles exaggerate and generalize things for clicks and views, but I wondered if there was any usefulness in that they may serve to flip a switch in the minds of new/young fans who haven't seen further than the glamour. Or maybe not, maybe these videos only serve to turn away any potentially interested people. Personally, I found this sub pretty much right after I started getting into kpop, so I gradually learned about contracts and work hours and dieting, etc from comments here written by more informed people who have followed events like contract lawsuits go down as they were happening. I didn't get the exaggerated list of ""here's everything wrong with kpop"" all at once from a podcast or a thread in r/all. 

So, my questions are:  
- What was your first encounter with the ""shady"" side like? You don't necessarily have to say what you learned if you don't want, just how you came to know of it (From a friend? An r/kpop comment? A listicle? Youtube? A thread on r/all? Were you a fan at the time, witnessing it it happen to your group?)  
- In what way do you think the way you first heard of it affected your perception of the industry?  
- Were there any misconceptions you had from when you first learned of the ""dark side"" which have been corrected as you became more informed? For example, that video throws out a blanket statement of ""No creative freedom in kpop"" which some may believe when they first encounter this kpop ""fact"", but older fans know about BAP, GD, etc. Even SNSD (who were shown in the video for that segment) got more creative input with lyrics in their later years.  

I don't know if this is a good discussion thread or a bad one, but I saw some recent comments complaining of repetitive discussions, so hopefully this topic is at least not overly done. Reddit search function sucks. 


Also, I thought maybe people could use this thread to correct misinformation on topics they see frequently touted as factual for any newer fans to read. Or maybe newer fans who've just seen that video could ask for more info here. I dunno, not a lot of comments in that thread so maybe not. ",7,0,False,self,,,,,

I personally think that Red Velvet is one of the most balanced groups; I believe that they suit each other's strengths and have an amazing synergy.
I also have a feeling that EXO seems pretty balanced, even though there are set roles of vocals, dancer, etc., they all shine individually and no one is left out. 

And for the opposite, I guess NCT and WinWin.

It is the first time that an overseas artist exceeded 300,000 points in the history of the Oricon charts (tracking week of December 4-10). It also topped the Oricon daily charts for a week. BTS has proven their popularity in Japan and this is their third Japanese release which has achieved the top spot in the Oricon  Charts, the previous ones being Chi, Ase, Namida (Blood Sweat &amp; Tears JP version) and their Love Yourself: Her album.

This comes ahead of BTS  making their Japanese primetime television debut on TV Asahi's Music Station Super Live on December 22.

A few users voiced some concerns and I decided that a minimum of 12 months needed to pass before a re-do but I wanted to let the subreddit decide if it should be longer than 12 months so I set up an instant runoff vote.   

http://www.demochoice.org/dcballot.php?poll=kpop2k17

All you need to do is rank the number of months you think should have to pass before a re-do. Your options are 12,18, 24, 30, 36 ,42, and 48 months. This is the most democratic way of deciding. The program takes all the #1 votes. If one of the choices has more than 50% of the vote it wins. If none of the choices have a majority, the choice with the least amount of #1 votes gets eliminated. The #2 votes for everyone that voted on the one that got eliminated now count as #1 votes. The program recounts the votes to see if any of the choices have a majority. If not it repeats the process.

I am writing an article about what music videos fans find iconic. I am hoping you could help. 

For me I would choose Bigbang's Fantastic Baby. I don't think it dates, is unforgettable, and you want to watch it to the end. Plus, that hair, I mean, thats enough for me lol. Bae Bae is close behind I think. 

If anyone wants to join a KakaoTalk group chat about Kpop, hit me up. Search for user lonni (ill be the redhead) or message me your user name and I can add you.

Thanks!

I guess it's save to assume that they pretty much grew up following schedules (prepared by others) and maybe, because of this, they never really learn to plan their days themselves. 

So, because of this, I wondered if they would experience difficulties with planning later in life/on days where they don't have a schedule to follow. What do you think? Would they need an 'extrinsic force' to basically tell them what to do, so they can just execute a plan? So that they are really motivated to literally *do* a list of tasks, but lack the ability to make such a 'list'?
Or do you think they would have so much intrinsic discipline/motivation that they would be great at scheduling in order to achieve their goals? Are there any instances where an idol has talked about this? I'm very curious!

I've been watching The Unit, and saw that [Madtown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dODodiuO0uU) dissembled and I thought that it was such a shame because they had such potential; their members are talented and good-looking, their songs were good, and Jota was getting their name out through variety shows. If they had a few more good releases, I think they could've been successful-- at least mid-tier. But then, all the drama with their companies happened and now they have no company or support and members are joining the army. If not for P101, Nu'est and Hotshot would've probably had the same fate. 

What other groups have a similar story?",106,59,False,self,,,,,

* This is the sixteenth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* **You can suggest only 3 songs.**
* **Each song has to be of a different group/artist.**
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Sub-Units**!
* Any song from a sub-unit of a group.
* It can also be ""unofficial"" sub-units. Like if two people from the same group did a normal collab.
* Can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [EXO-CBX - Hey Mama!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOzVyVv1HtQ)
* [Jooheon x I.M - Be My Friend](https://youtu.be/3BzGDrR1jB4)
* [JJ Project - On &amp; On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HU8EzE-JII)

Sub-Unit playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdsG1YbXvvYQVgCxE1lReP-w)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

We've seen a lot of trends come and go over the years, be it autotune, dubstep break downs or questionable styling. 
  
  
For me, this year I feel like stylists went too extreme with the blonde look. Ok let's bleach your hair, OK now make your eyebrows the same colour, AND BLUE CONTACT LENSES. Some artists can carry it off but some just look like aliens (I'm looking at cube entertainment...) I hope next year they'll step back a bit (which is strange to say because that's basically what they were doing before) and generally I'd like to see less boybands in coloured contacts because a lot of the time it's just unnecessary imo.

Which line do you think would make the best subunit? I think BTS's maknae line would make a pretty well-rounded subunit. TWICE's vocal-line (mainly Jihyo, Nayeon, Jeongyeon) would be interesting to see as I think they can pull off a more mature sound compared to what we're used to from TWICE as a whole.",105,63,False,self,,,,,

One of my favorite things about kpop is how the actual on-stage performances/dances complement the songs themselves. This includes some songs that I didn't love when I first listened, but just got hooked after watching the performance. For me, probably the biggest example is Red Velvet's Rookie. I actually was pretty disappointed when I first heard it, but after seeing the lives and how exciting the dance was, I got really into it and it's become one of my favorites by them!

Being an international fan I chose rap parts mainly for its sound since I can't accurately evaluate them by use of language:

- EXO's Chanyeol &amp; Sehun's cadence jabs in [""Forever""](https://youtu.be/A_V7VGgi5b0?t=3m1s) (3:01) felt like a lvl up in EXO's rapping quality.

- 9Muses' Sojin's vicious but ice-cold voice tone and flow in [""Remember""](https://youtu.be/9fbrjY1S73E?t=2m14s)(2:14)  works perfectly with this amazing track.
- Love the way Mark delivered his rap verse in NCT 127's [""Cherry Bomb""](https://youtu.be/WkuHLzMMTZM?t=2m31s) (2:02). His flow sounds bold and confident which adds alot of charisma to this rap verse.

- I noticed that rap is mostly used in kpop to ""energize"" the sound, but  Moonbyul's short rap in Mamamoo's [""Yes I am""](https://youtu.be/Ue9NG1hAr78?t=2m35s) (2:35) is placed on the ""calming"" part of the track which stood out to my ears.
Learning that the lyrics are about self acceptance made me like it even more.

State your reasons and provide links if possible! It doesn't have to be technical or lyrical, reasons could just be musical qualities,message etc.
 That being said it would be interesting in hearing about profound 2017 idol raps from those who understand the language fluently.",103,98,False,self,,,,,

It is currently getting a lot of heat from k-netz. The top comment on the original article about Kush currently has 23k upvotes and is still trending at #12 on NAVER - so about as much heat as TOP got -
 which surprises me tbh.

But the case has only worsened post that article.

Another celebrity - chef Lee Chan-oh has gotten involved in this case. And this has opened up a conversation about drug abuse in the entertainment industry (article about this trending at #3 on NAVER rn).

This year alone, 4 celebrities have gotten **caught:**

* TOP (Idol, Marijuana)
* Yoon Cheol Jung (10 cm, Marijuana)
* Kush (Producer, Cocaine)
* Lee Chan-oh (Chef, Hashish?)

//*5 if you consider Han Seo Hee a celebrity*//

And there's been a lot of cases regarding this in recent years:

* GD (Idol, Marijuana)
* Choi Chang-yeop (Actor, Methamphetamine) 
* Iron (Rapper, Marijuana)
* Kidoh (Rapper, Marijuana)
* Another MC. Idk the name.

**BUT** 4 cases in 1 year and 2 in 2016 would be quite unprecedented for SK where drugs are not just illegal but also quite demonized. The increasing cases of drug abuse certainly aren't limited to just the entertainment industry.

What are your thoughts on the topic in general? Do you think there's a spike in consumption - if so, why? What do you consider to the status of drug usage, in general, in SK - is this consumption related just to the entertainment industry? Do you think celebs getting involved has had any effect on the attitude of GP esp. the younger demographic towards drug consumption? What would you think should be the deserving penalty for such cases?",152,82,False,self,,,,,

Boy group:
Pentagon: I must admit that their debut didn't stand out to me last year. This group has shown great growth this year. Releasing songs like Critical Beauty which showcased a different sound , Like This(brilliantly composed by member Hui who also composed Wanna One's Never with fellow members E'dawn and Wooseok and Energetic(with Wooseok) ) and most recently Runaway. They are also great performers and are developing their own image.

Runaway: https://youtu.be/vxpRxiNM2sQ
Like This: https://youtu.be/AeLifhqRggg

Girl group:
Red Velvet:
With the release of 2 mini albums: Rookie and The Red Summer, and a full album Perfect  Velvet, Red Velvet showcased how versatile they can be as a group both musically and conceptually. 
I was quite impressed.

Who stood out the most to you this year?

For the latter, I try to explain to them to open their minds and leave any preconceived notions behind. 

99% of the time people don't care and end up either a) Not caring at all or b) Straight up hating

Have you guys ever had an experience like this when people who said such things actually acknowledge that they were wrong and start getting into KPop? Let us discuss how to respond to such statements without offending people and trying to get them interested instead!

OK **a lot of people are completely misunderstanding my post**. This post is **NOT** about convincing people to get into KPop or being insecure about following KPop. I'm **100% PROUD** about listening to KPop and I simply want to discuss how to respond to such ignorant and irritating comments in a mature way so that they do not immediately associate KPop in their minds as ''some novelty s*** that bratty teenagers like"".

Just posting about a year end update I have to the ongoing gigantic Kpop playlist I created for the purpose of adding translated lyrics on Musixmatch. 

The good news is there are lots and lots of new songs, especially EDM (including tropical EDM and house) and R&amp;B.  There are almost 1100 songs now. The not-so-fantastic news is that I haven't been able to translate some of the newer stuff, so if there are any requests for translations in particular, you can tell me here so that I can know what to prioritize. I have the same situation with my Cpop playlist, so I'm falling behind!

Theres no group I cant listen to or something, in fact I like many groups.
But I have noticed i tend to like dark blue/dark green/light brown voices better.
In my case, got7s is my ult group. I guess its because they all have voices of colors I love.
Verse 2 is the album of the year to me considering Jaebums voice is dark green and Jinyoungs is dark blue.

What are some other examples of surprisingly perfect english pronunciation?

Another example is GFRIEND - Rainbow where Yuju says [""Colors""](https://youtu.be/g8VkS2FMf7M?t=1m10s) perfectly.

Even if the members singing these parts are the ones who speak english I still find it interesting that suddenly you hear perfect english in a song where after listening to so much K-Pop you always expect some hint of an accent lol",224,119,False,self,,,,,

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment

Some things to consider..

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process. 

2. Because this has occurred before... if I don't reply it is because I'm tired of writing back to people that the song you requested has already been translated and I found it in 5 seconds using google. If there is previously translated lyrics thats hard to understand, give me a link so I know at least you looked and I'll judge it it warrants a better translation.

3. For the sake of time, I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection. 

4. I will be back in 24 hours to check! = P",14,16,False,self,,,,,

There is a tie for 9th best side track vote on the straw poll to decide which song is better

[Maze VS Memory](http://www.strawpoll.me/14644890)


January 2nd we'll be voting on the Schedule for Feb-June. No re-dos will be allowed this time. 

A few users voiced some concerns and I decided that a minimum of 12 months needed to pass before a re-do but I wanted to let the subreddit decide if it should be longer than 12 months so I set up an instant runoff vote.   

http://www.demochoice.org/dcballot.php?poll=kpop2k17

All you need to do is rank the number of months you think should have to pass before a re-do. Your options are 12,18, 24, 30, 36 ,42, and 48 months. This is the most democratic way of deciding. The program takes all the #1 votes. If one of the choices has more than 50% of the vote it wins. If none of the choices have a majority, the choice with the least amount of #1 votes gets eliminated. The #2 votes for everyone that voted on the one that got eliminated now count as #1 votes. The program recounts the votes to see if any of the choices have a majority. If not it repeats the process.

Please remember to **be objective** in your choices and choose the BEST of 2017!  Take time to watch the videos and evaluate the categories.  This is not the census, so it's not about which groups are your favorites.  Most importantly, have fun and use this opportunity to show those other awards shows how it's done.

*  **UPDATE:** We have added an additional verification link at the end of the ballot.  Click on the link on the final page to send a reddit PM to our bot.  The PM is pre-filled, so you only need to click send.  If you do not send the PM, your vote will not be counted.  After you have sent the PM, return to the form and click Submit to finish the ballot.  If you have already completed the ballot, you will be exempted from this step, so don't worry.

*  **You must include your Reddit username in the form.**  Ballots will be cross-referenced with Reddit.  Only accounts created before December 11, 2017 are eligible to vote.  This is to prevent the vote from being brigaded by Twitter or other sites.  If you typo your username, your vote will not count so pay attention.

* **You must be logged into Google to vote.**  This is the only way Google provides to prevent multiple ballots.  We are NOT 
collecting email addresses.

Seeing how Jonghyun's in the thoughts and hearts of so many others right now is helping to address my grief, and I hope that this can help for many others here as well.

**Please feel free to comment below, and share links to other posts/tweets/thoughts I haven't been able to add yet myself.** Especially if there's a tribute on someone's Instagram story, or similar content - I'm unable to access it myself at the moment. I'll try my best to update this post throughout the day.

EDIT: I don't expect many posts from other current SM artists for a variety of reasons. But with so many reactions pouring in, I'm trying my best to distinguish those who we know had worked with him directly. It's difficult to draw a line, because Jonghyun was so well-known in the Korean music industry and got to meet so many people over the past decade.

I've also found [@fyjjong on Tumblr](http://fyjjong.tumblr.com/) to be a great rehosted and translated source, in case some of these links break later.

**EDIT:** some people have mentioned that the translation that was initially linked felt kinda rushed and it's true that a letter of such weight and importance should be translated very carefully. Here are some more detailed translations:

&gt;*I am damaged from the inside. The depression that has been slowly eating away at me has completely swallowed me, and I couldn't win over it.    
I hated myself. I tried to hold on to breaking memories and yelled at myself to get a grip, but there was no answer.    
If I can't clear my breath, it's better to stop.    
I asked myself who can take care of myself.    
It's only me.    
I was alone.
It's easy to say I'll end things.    
It's hard to end things.    
I lived all this time because of that difficulty.    
They said I wanted to run away.    
That's true. I wanted to run away.    
From me.    
From you.    
I asked who it was. It was me. And it was me. And it was me again.    
I asked why I kept losing my memories. They said it was because of my personality.     
I see. It was my fault in the end.    
I wanted someone to notice, but no one noticed. No one met me, so of course they don't know I exist.    
I asked why people live. Just. Just. People just live.    
If I ask why people die, I guess they'd say they were tired.    
I suffered and I worried. I never learned how to turn my pain into happiness.    
Pain is just pain.    
They told me not to be like that.    
Why? I can't even end things the way I want?    
They told me to figure out why I was hurting.    
I know very well why. I'm hurting because of me. It's all my fault and because I'm bad.    
Doctor, is this what you wanted to hear?    
No, I didn't do anything wrong.    
When the doctor blamed my personality with a quiet voice, I thought it was so easy to be a doctor.    
It's amazing how much I'm hurting. People who are hurting more live well. People weaker than me live well.     
I guess not.     
Out of everyone alive, there's no one hurting more than I am and there's no one weaker than I am.    
But they said I should live.    
I asked why so many times, but it's not for me.    
It's for you.    
I wanted to be for me.    
Don't say things that don't make sense.    
Figure out why I'm hurting? I told you why. Why I was hurting.     
Is it not okay to be hurting this much because of that? Do I need a more dramatic detail? I need more of a story?    
I told you why. Were you not listening? Things I can win over don't end in scars.    
It wasn't my place to clash with the world.    
It wasn't my life to be known to the world.    
They said that was why I was hurting more.     
Because I had clashed with the world, because I was known to the world.     
Why did I choose this? That's funny.    
It's a miracle I lasted this far.    
What more can I say?     
Just tell me I worked hard.    
That it was good of me to come this far.     
That I worked hard.    
Even if you can't smile as you let me go, please don't blame me.    
I worked hard.    
I really did work hard.*

&gt;*Good bye.*

A few users voiced some concerns and I decided that a minimum of 12 months needed to pass before a re-do but I wanted to let the subreddit decide if it should be longer than 12 months so I set up an instant runoff vote.   

http://www.demochoice.org/dcballot.php?poll=kpop2k17

All you need to do is rank the number of months you think should have to pass before a re-do. Your options are 12,18, 24, 30, 36 ,42, and 48 months. This is the most democratic way of deciding. The program takes all the #1 votes. If one of the choices has more than 50% of the vote it wins. If none of the choices have a majority, the choice with the least amount of #1 votes gets eliminated. The #2 votes for everyone that voted on the one that got eliminated now count as #1 votes. The program recounts the votes to see if any of the choices have a majority. If not it repeats the process.

1653,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-12-19,2017,12,19,22,7kt61h,self.kpop,My final account,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7kt61h/my_final_account/,L-autrichienne,1513689232,"Hey so, /u/L-autrichienne here... formally known as /u/ladauphine back in my heyday. I used to be really active and posted tons of fanaccounts of my adventures with SHINee, the boys who brought me to Korea and gave me the grand adventure I was looking for in my life. My bias was Jonghyun. And I just got home from his funeral.

Now, just to get this out of the way quickly, I have no intentions of following in his footsteps. Those sorts of thoughts are the kind of personal demons I have never had to deal with thankfully. However, if you do, Ill include some numbers to call in this post. Just to be safe.

Second, I'm writing this for you guys because over the past three and half years you have been fucking wonderful. Really. The positive responses and knowing that I helped you guys feel closer to the boys that meant... mean so much to me gives me joy. But right now, we are are devestated. Truly and deeply. And earlier /u/PmMeTwiceKpop asked me to bring me with me the love of all of you that couldn't go tonight. 

I tried my best, I promise. 

But when I read that and was done with that particular crying jag, I realized I wanted to write one final... account for you. I know that a lot of you must feel so alone. I was surrounded by Shawols, by others who understand my pain all night and I felt all alone. I cannot imagine how you guys feel. So I wanted to share this one last thing.

Warning: I have endured the death of two fathers (biological:sudden death but not very close and stepfather: very close but very drawn out due to illness) and this was possibly the worst thing that I've ever endured. This account is going to not be a fun read. It will also contain tons of stream of conscious and typos...

You've been warned.

So, I don't really know where to start. No point in starting at the beginning... we were all there for that. We all had our moments of hearts dropping, dizziness, and what have you. I personally haven't eaten in... a while nor did I sleep any last night. Too busy frantically taking posters down and turning everythign with his face over. We all had our shit. I hope youa ll had someone you loved with you.

So I'll start with this afternoon I guess. Today being possibly the longest fucking day in the history of long days... my roommate and I left our apartments at about 4ish to go meet our remaining two friends in Korea. She and I had skipped out on our adult responsibilities for the day and just laid in my bed and cried a lot. We did pretty well in public until our friends actually got there. Something about seeing them for the first time since it happened made it so real. The subway ride was largely in silence, we held hands most of the way there. especially towards the stop cause we could see other Shawols.

I have a nose for fellow Shawols you see, often its the mint, sometimes its the dress style, but sometimes its just a feeling. And I'm particularly good at following Shawols to events that I don't quite know how to get to. 

Today was different, instead of following shawols there... I just walked alongside the continuous chain of crying or just desolate looking girls. It got me and my friends there.

When we arrived... we saw the line coming out of the building... and followed it... across roads and around a corner. In total 3 blocks nearly. There had to be over 3 or 4 thousand girls in front of me in line. And they just kept coming. I was the back of the line for about 2 seconds.

Like the good Shawols we are, we all instinctively lined two by two. But unlike a usual Shawol line, this one was largely silent. Broken only by sniffles, the occasional wracking sob or incredulous ""wtf is even happening"" laugh. Later, as we got closer to the other roads, the traffic directing man was blowing his whistle continuously. I don't want to ever hear a whistle again.

Honestly, the line went, surprisingly fast. They had two viewing rooms open and they were enormous. As we neared the building I started shaking so hard. Even though it was freezing, even though there was snow on the ground, snow that had fallen while Jonghyun was still alive (yesterday morning was the prettiest morning), I wasn't actually cold. I just... I don't even know. I didn't want to go in so badly, but I knew I'd regret it forever if I didn't.

Finally we entered the building. 

I have nevr  attended a Korean funeral before. I didn't know exactly what to expect. But there was a screen that showed all of the services goign on at that moment, their location, a picture of the deceased along with their familys and closest friends names. Some of you probably saw thsi picture going around. I was stopped in front of it for some time. 

I have never felt such a deep sense of dread. Not only because of that, but because when we got there... I saw all these girls I know. Ive been doing events for 3 and half years. I recognize so many of them. Their faces just crushed me. That and knowing ill probably never see them again.

In addition to all that hah... the wailing. it was so loud... and so much. Eventually they lined us up in front of the room. one line would go in, all the others would shift right until your line was along the wall and then theyd put your line in.

Everytime a line went in the wailing became so much more intense. But later I realized it wasn't the girls going in who were wailing. It was the ones leaving. inside the room... there were lines maybe 10 wide and maybe 15 ish deep. You started at the back and as each line at the front was escorted out you moved a step forward. 

At first, there were so many people, all I could see was the cross just below the ceiling. Jonghyun was atheist... but his family are catholic and Im sure that gave them some comfort. I hope so.

As I moved forward, my view shifted.... And I saw the portrait. And the Flowers... My first sight of the portrait I almost collapsed. I could't breathe. I... i dont even now. it was just the worst feeling. I can't even describe it. Although sometime after that... as i steadily marched towards my doom once slow step at a time I almost laughed. That was just the most surreal fuckign moment I have ever experienced. It was almost absurd. I don't know what exactly came over me but I got it under control fairly quickly.

Outside of the exit door... it was really loud. I looked over and I could see girls on their knees and leaning on each other sobbing, their bodies shaking so hard. It was kind of frightening.... knowing that in mere minutes I would be out there with them. Having said my final goodbye.

And that moment came quickly. My row was called up. The usher? I guess called for the first greeting. we bowed, shaking and clutching each other. Then he called for the moment of silence?. we took our moment staring at the floor, the portrait with his beautiful smile, the lovely flowers, the pile of letters and we cried. The girls who had letters then were able to put them on the table. Then the usher called for the final goodbye... i whispered that hed worked hard, hed done well and that ill always love him. 

And then it was my turn to go into the... hall of sadness. The doors were open, it was so cold. But all we could do was hold each other and sob. what else was there to do?

finally we headed home. It felt so long. but now im here, my toes are slowly regaining feeling even if my heart isnt.

And here is where my account ends.

What follows is just... some thoughts and feelings. Since this will be my last account. And that line will probably be my last SHINee line. I don't think I can do anything else. Ill still love the others. But I cant. Maybe one day. But I doubt it.

So here goes. Some thank yous lol. This is gonna be an Oscars level thank you speech haha. 

First and foremost, to all of you /r/kpop subscribers... Yall are great. really. You made me feel like I was doing some good for the world writing for yall. I sincerely hope that you all get through this with whole hearts... scarred but whole. I love you. Thank you for everything

To /u/monodramas and /u/alfredfjones , yall are my girls. No matter what comes I never want to stop talking to yall and reading your fucking weird ass conversations everyday ok. We will get through this together.

To my friends in Korea, who will never read this but I feel like I should thank because this life would not have been nearly as fantastic without them.

Ez: oh nana of the group, once the ticketing goddess always the ticketing goddess, who had little glue tubes on hand to mend my shoes on teh way to my ot3 Odd fansign. 

Ev: my fellow blinger. nothing will ever replace the weekend we spent together doing global package for Jonghyuns Inspiration concert. Im sorry I scratched you in excitement that first night.

H: Will never forget the time you literally crawled under girls to get the notice number for us. You da real mvp. 

J: the bounciest of us all. your optimism was all that made some 2 am lines bearable. also your warm bouncy hair. 

C: your just unreal wit and wonderful way of talking to people always brightened my day. yes that beer truly did taste like a room.

And to the ones who went with me tonight

M: i met you on day 3 in korea and you immediatelly took me to steal a key zorro poster off of a wall in hongdae. i knew we'd be friends then. And without you I never could have said such meaningful things to jonghyun during my first few fansigns. 

Y: During Jonghyun's first fanmeet during base, when I didn't speak any Korean, you were next to me in line and told me how to say ""Im proud of you"" in Korean. I was barely able to get that and I love you out while holding his hand but i did it thanks to your help.

And to my platonic life partner: You've been with me since the first day. When i fell in love with that one video clip of Taemin dancing to lucifer. You came on this crazy adventure with me and have been at my side for all of the best moemnts in SHINee world. I love you more than life itself. We will get through this.

And finally

To Jonghyun:

I loved you yesterday, I love you today, and I'll love you forever. You gave me so much joy, so much comfort. I don't know how to exist in a world without you. But ill try my best to learn. We all will. . .

We will get through this. We all will. As dark as it seems now, it will get better. Everyone has good things in their life. It can be big or small. Find those focus on those.

As for me, ive got wonderful friends, a loving boyfriend, a warm fuzzy cat, and lots of english breakfast tea.

I won't delete this account. But I'm goign to sign out after I post this and make sure it doesn't get deleted cause of formatting rules or something.

Love to you all.

I've gotten more than one inbox requesting for me to translate their eulogy to Korean so they can put it in a vigil for shinee in their city. 

Those who know me, I translate Kpop song into English. Long story short, I have some contacts in Korea that would wish to leave messages at (Korean asan medical center I believe if not at SM center). They plan to put post it sticky note with country wallpaper representing where the notes came from.  If you have a message, leave a comment and I'll translate them and will email to my contacts and your message will be with fans in Korea

1. Please keep it short because its done by 4 people (including me) and it has to be on a sticky notes. And our English to Korean is a lot harder for us than Korean to English.
2. Name and country. This is important because it sticky note needs to be divided into countries to show that people all over the world are known to shinee and they asked me not to use username out of respect. (first name is fine if you worry about privacy)
3. Because of the nature of the eulogy based on culture, I will try to translate it more in Korean standard (such as people don't say ""I hope you rest in peace"" as often in Korean eulogy as they say ""I wish upon you for eternal rest in warm and nice place""
4. I will check this periodically and tell you its been translated. I will do best I can but given the request, please do forgive me if I cannot get to yours. I will do as much as I can with given time I have. ",1386,976,False,self,,,,,

* This is the seventeenth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* **You can suggest only 1 song.** 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Your Favorite Kpop Song**!

* Any k-pop song. Old or New. Soloist or Group.
* **Only one!**

Here is my favorite -

* [BIGBANG - BANG BANG BANG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw)

Favorite Song playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgduHmTAgnkpspWkiiBApZDsv)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

The moderator compared his death to the KPop-world to the one of late Chester Benington of Linkin Park to their genre. The moderator read out fan post regarding Jonghyun's death and afterwards played their song ""Tell me what to do"". Over the course of the day, many German newspapers published articles on his death, mentioning him as a member of the ""27 Club"" along the lines of Jimmy Hendrix, Kurt Cobain and more. 

KPop has never been popular in Germany, not even close to being played on radio, this just shows how much KPop has grown and how large Shinee's and Jonghyun's influence on the music is.

Rest in peace, Kim Jonghyun. You did well.",14,697,False,self,,,,,

I don't know about you guys, but this has been the most difficult three days. So many updates and new pieces of information keep trickling in and while I know they're so painful to digest, it's what's keeping me going. For those of you who are in a similar place as I, we're in this together. For those of you who are still in a terrible place of mind, we're in this together, as well, so please just take care of yourselves and avoid whatever subject material you must in the meantime.

It has been revealed that Jonghyun's comeback song, ""Only One You Need,"" is a song that comforts those grieving the loss of a loved one. If you are able to do so, you can read the article and listen to the performance [here](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/12/jonghyun-revealed-to-have-written-a-song-for-those-grieving-at-the-loss-of-a-loved-one).

I'm crying as I type this up, but it's too upbeat of a song and beautiful of a message to sweep aside. I'd like to believe that this wonderful soul, this angel of a human now at peace, wanted to give us this as a parting gift. To console his family, group members, friends, fans, everyone that he is in a better place. I know it's much too soon to even think about this notion, but I really hope someday, somewhere down the line, SM will release the audio and/or MV in his memory. Maybe even have proceeds go towards donation in his name. I feel like it'd be an appreciative gesture to the amazing musician that he was.

You did more than well, Kim Jonghyun. You were perfect beyond compare and we're sorry that we couldn't do more to help you realize that. We're sorry that you had suffered alone for so long.

Rest easy and rest well. We love you dearly.

EDIT: I just finished watching the fancam of ""Lonely"" from his INSPIRED concert and... Both of these combined hit me so hard, so quickly. It feels like there's an anchor on my chest. I'm at a loss for words yet want to say so much.

EDIT 2: I finally, *finally* remember the right phrase for this situation: He hid his sorrows in plain sight. He was vocal about his dark thoughts and feelings, either through his spoken or sung words. I'm so, so sorry, Jonghyun. I'm just so sorry. I wish I could turn back time and make things right somehow.",177,1045,False,self,,,,,

Something unimaginable has happened to us as a community.  Weve lost someone we all care for deeply, someone who was an irreplaceable part of SHINee and the K-pop world as a whole.  Whilst reading all of the letters in our server and seeing everyone express themselves and pour their emotions into their words, we decided we should channel this into something we can give to SHINee to show them our love for Jonghyun.

In light of this, the SHINee Discord mods have decided to start a project for a message book and charity. We've decided wed also like to extend this project past just Discord and include as many people in it as would like to join.

Well be collecting, compiling, and translating messages from fans into a book commemorating Jonghyun to send to the SHINee members. Well also be including with the book the certificate of the donation we made in his honor.

 The charity portion of the project is completely optional. *We know not everyone has money, and the book itself will still be made no matter what*, as the donations weve received from in-server already cover the book cost. Because of that, any additional donations will be given to a foundation that focuses on mental health and LGBTQ+ youth activism in South Korea, which we think is something Jonghyun would believe in. The foundation is called **Dding Dong**. If youd like to learn more about it, Ill provide a link to more information at the bottom of this post.

----

**If you would like to participate in this project, here are some guidelines to ensure that everyone can be included:**

* Any length is fine. Express everything youd like to in your message.

* Sign it with your real first name, and country you live in.

* Don't write anything you wouldn't want SHINee or potentially other people at SM reading. That's where we're sending it after all.

* We will be including artwork as well and you are most welcome to submit art that youve created instead. Photos that remind you of him are also welcome.

* If youre at a loss for words, but still want to contribute or show your love in some way, you may also submit your name and country and we will add it to a list that will be published at the end of the book that includes everyone who has contributed to the project.

----

To submit a message, you can either DM me your submission, or join the SHINee Discord server and post it in the designated channel.

All submissions will be translated into Korean by a few talented and generous individuals who have offered their time and help to us.

**The due date for submissions will be January 5th, 2018.**

If you would like to make a donation towards this project, please click through the link to the PayPal Pool at the bottom of this post and please also leave a donation note with who it is from.  Once the project is over and we have mailed the book and donated the money, we will post pictures of the book and documentation of the donation as well.

From Shawol to Shawol (or non-Shawol), please stay strong.

**EDIT** :
Due to the sheer number of submissions we've been receiving, I wanted to put on here that if you're fluent in Korean and would like to join the translation team and help out, please DM me and let me know! We ideally want this project to be something we can finish and send to SHINee in a timely manner, and the more people who help, the better!

There's a partial English sub of the first half of the episode by the [Weki Meki Eng Subs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCarwffzhu4KQ25MW2Z9EMEg/videos) YouTube channel, but it's not on YouTube directly, so YMMV.

Summary of what's going on:

- The members introduce one another round robin style. Interesting notes:

  - Sei's into organic food and has started drinking tea before bed. She's famous for being slow, but she's pretty fast running to her cup when the tea's done...
  - Rina's the calm one even though she's the 2nd youngest and is good at drawing.
  - Lua and Lucy go to the same school in the morning and work out together in the evening.

- They prepared individual intros in Chinese: Pretty Girl Doyeon, Organic Sei, Leader Suyeon, Giant Maknae Lucy, Precious Kisser Lua, Marshmallow Elly (which the hosts are confused about because Marshmallow was in English), Delicate Rina, and Super Cutie Yoojung.

- They look up to SNSD as role models and sing a bit of ""Genie"".

- They split into teams to play the headphones telephone game (best description I could think of) where they try to relay Chinese phrases without horribly mangling them. The winners get bubble tea, but one person from each team first has to try [Taiwanese bitter tea,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR56TW4zCWc) herbal health tea that is famously bitter. (Response: ""I can't breathe."")

- The last part is a dance contest, which is neat; they picked the top 3 out of 50 dance cover groups to perform ""I don't like your Girlfriend"" (plus surprises) for WeMe to help judge 1st to 3rd place.

From there, many of these people go online and read one or two stale articles about KPOP (insert some dismissive and extremely White publication here, often hipster) and try to justify their immediate disgust at KPOP with talking points from these articles. (I think this is generally the kind of demographic you find on Reddit.)

There was even a viral video criticizing KPOP circulating recently like this that said KPOP stars were, and I quote, ""trying to look like **anime** characters."" So ignorant and racist. 

I wrote a bunch of specific points down but would rather hear what you guys have to say first.

 ^Every ^week ^ ^Last: ^2017-12-23

Even nearly three months later, Oh My Girl's Closer is still one of our Top 10 Jukebox songs. And SHINee, once again, has three songs on the Top 10...ah, I hope they're all okay. I hope you all are okay as well.

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy the songs chosen, and I hope, in the spirit of the holidays, you have yourself a Merry Little Christmas! And if you don't celebrate Christmas, I nonetheless wish you Happy [Ho-Ho-Holidays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwN-CN9EjTg) and good will to you.

I think its been a pretty stellar year album wise. Thanks to everyone on this sub for all the great recommendations over the year. Happy Christmas!

1. Offonoff - Boy. I absolutely adore this one to the point that its become my all time favourite Korean album. Individually the songs are all great but taken together they build up this lovely woozy 3am mood. 

2. Red Velvet - Perfect Velvet. A worthy follow up to their classic Red Album

3. IU - Palette. Such a beautifully put together album. Great songwriting and IUs vocals express so much in such a subtle way

4. EXID - Eclipse. So many brilliant tracks on this one. Velvet might be my favourite b side of the year. 

5. Loona Odd Eye Circle  - Max and Match. Like many others I was totally won over by Loona this year. Girl Front, Loonatic and Chaotic were three of the reasons why. 

6. Epik High - Weve Done Something Wonderful. I came to this album pretty late but its absolutely fantastic. 

7. BTS - Love Yourself: Her. Im not a BTS stan but I cant deny the brilliance of this one. A fantastically put together album 

8. Red Velvet - Rookie/ Red Summer. More Red Velvet brilliance. Didnt love either all the way through but so many great b sides on each 

9. Oh My Girl - Coloring Book. I wasnt a huge fan of the title track but the album was great. 

10. Suran - Walkin. Another one I came late to but have really enjoyed.

[Link to AOA + AOA Black Voting Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7kqqbp/rkpop_top_ten_tuesdays_voting_thread_aoa_aoa_black/)


January 2nd we'll be voting on the Schedule for Feb-June. No re-dos will be allowed this time. 

A few users voiced some concerns and I decided that a minimum of 12 months needed to pass before a re-do but I wanted to let the subreddit decide if it should be longer than 12 months so I set up an instant runoff vote.   

http://www.demochoice.org/dcballot.php?poll=kpop2k17

All you need to do is rank the number of months you think should have to pass before a re-do. Your options are 12,18, 24, 30, 36 ,42, and 48 months. This is the most democratic way of deciding. The program takes all the #1 votes. If one of the choices has more than 50% of the vote it wins. If none of the choices have a majority, the choice with the least amount of #1 votes gets eliminated. The #2 votes for everyone that voted on the one that got eliminated now count as #1 votes. The program recounts the votes to see if any of the choices have a majority.

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Anything else is fair game, no matter how trivial or silly.  Remember, you can ask your K-pop questions any day of the week over at r/kpophelp.

A few users voiced some concerns and I decided that a minimum of 12 months needed to pass before a re-do but I wanted to let the subreddit decide if it should be longer than 12 months so I set up an instant runoff vote.   

http://www.demochoice.org/dcballot.php?poll=kpop2k17

All you need to do is rank the number of months you think should have to pass before a re-do. Your options are 12,18, 24, 30, 36 ,42, and 48 months. This is the most democratic way of deciding. The program takes all the #1 votes. If one of the choices has more than 50% of the vote it wins. If none of the choices have a majority, the choice with the least amount of #1 votes gets eliminated. The #2 votes for everyone that voted on the one that got eliminated now count as #1 votes. The program recounts the votes to see if any of the choices have a majority. If not it repeats the process.

* This is the eighteenth and last installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* **You can suggest only 3 songs.** 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Your Top 3 Songs Of 2017**!

* B-side, Title track, anything!
* Doesn't have to be in order.
* **Only 3!**
* Gotta be in the year 2017 obviously.

Here is my top 3 -

* [Winner - Really Really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tBnF46ybZk)
* [Monsta X - Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5Zedh_5DDM)
* [BTS - Not Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEtMPDHHtpo)

Top Songs Of 2017 playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgduTymg8Bv5qECpUffaE-nEq)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

Thank you to everyone who participated! This year had so many up and downs but i'm glad that a lot of bops came along with it. Hope you guys discovered new songs while listening to these playlists! If the mods could put these playlists some where so they can be referenced in the future, that would be nice! :) Hope y'all enjoyed! Lets look forward to what the next year brings us!",179,106,False,self,,,,,

This will be done in three parts as well. I could also subtitle this as the time I saw NCT 3 days in a row. 

Part 1: NCT 127 Cherry Bomb Prerec

After a very long week of well, we all know what happened by now, I started my winter vacation by running out of my apartment at 10:30 pm to get over to the Sky Dome to get to the notice for NCT. The prerecording was going to be done on 12/23. My check in number was 111 and since I was there so late at night, I got a taxi home.

The next day, I arrived around 3:30 or so for the check in and waited for my few foreigner NCTzen friends. There was 4 of us total in our crew so we stuck together until we had to get into our lines. Our meeting place was at a basketball court right by the Sky Dome.  I got in mine, got checked in, and waited until staff came. For this one in order to be N1 you needed your photo id, fan card, and light stick, no album this time. I got my number which was N1 94 and got my fan card signed and was able to leave to warm up until 6:50 when we had to be back to line up for entry. My friends and I all had different numbers so we weren't by each other in the lines but it was okay. 

We all got lined up again and then walked over to the Sky Dome. We then waited in our lines until we were brought over to enter the venue. HOWEVER, we went the wrong way at first. We had to enter from the side closer to the bridge and not the other way. So we went up that god forsaken hill and waited next to the side. 

Staff then told us that we would be watching Gashina and after that we would be placed in our proper seats. We went into the venue around 9 pm and sat down and waited for Gashina, the national anthem of Korea where I literally lost it the entire time. 

Sunmi's prerec took a while and she was super bored. She kept saying random things in the mic and everyone laughed. The staging was so cool and I was super hyped as well. After she finished, her fans left the seated pit and slowly but surely NCTzens filled it. Some how, I got in to that section. I was beyond thrilled. 

The boys did one rehearsal and about 3 takes. I can't remember exactly because I came out of that rehearsal remembering only one thing: Johnny was the center of the dance break. I heard that the camera filming sucked so you didn't see it but trust me. He was the center for 20 glorious seconds. 

We all lost it seeing Taeyong with black hair and Mark with the return of the ramen hair. I also remember freaking out when we saw all the backup dancers. It was like an army. Their outfits were sparkly white and each one of them had a ribbon on for Jonghyun. They all looked so tired but worked their hearts out. They gave it their all. Mark kept pointing at his ribbon a lot. Yuta was definitely in a mood. He was so feeling it that I was getting angry at him (for my friends who are Yuta biased of course). The fanchants were really loud as well.

After the final take ended, Taeyong made the boys stand in a line and greet us. They then bowed to everyone and left the stage. We left the venue and were told to be back around 11:50 pm to check in again for the collab stage. That prerec would happen in the early hours of December 24. 

Part 2: Collab Prerec

December 24, 2017. GOT7 had finished their prerec since they were after us. We entered with IGOT7s and some of each fandom got to go to the seated pit again. I was lucky to get there again. We walked to our seats, sat down and then suddenly Uhm Junghwa walked out! We were going to be watching her prerec as well. It took a long time, until a little after 1 am. She was so good though. 

When she ended, they announced it was time for the last prerec of the night. Collab stage had one rehearsal and four takes. For the first take, they all wore name tags to help the camera people. I'm also going to say this now: Bambam is so hot. I could not focus whenever he was on that stage.

All of them were wearing black. Yuta finally had his time to shine. Doyoung did so good. I was so proud of him. Jinyoung was on fire. But Taeyong....he went so hard each take that his in-ears fell out. For the very last take, they fell out within the first ten seconds. He still went on performing. Before the third take, Doyoung and Jinyoung came out holding each other and everyone screamed. JinDo giving my life. At the end of the recording, they got in a line and Doyoung thanked both NCTzens and IGOT7s for supporting them with the stage. Jinyoung then got the mic and started to thank IGOT7s. He then looked to Taeyong and asked him ""What is your fandom called?"" Taeyong told him and Jinyoung then went on to thank the NCTzens. It was so adorable. And then they were done. I got a cab home and thought ""Oh, this will be the last time I see them until MBC Gayo."" 

I was wrong.

Part 3: SBS Gayo Daejun

December 24, 2017 and I was at church eating food when I found out that a notice came out. I said ""Sorry Jesus"" and went back to the Sky Dome since only 200 people would get in. I met up with one of my friends and we headed to the notice together and got our numbers. We then said our see you laters for the next day.

Christmas Day aka SBS Gayo Day. I arrived before 1 pm and it was freezing cold out. We waited under a bridge for check in and got in our lines. Everything went fast but also slow. We got into our official tier lines and waited until we got the all clear to move inside. We started moving and my toes slowly regained feeling in them. We then were bought up to the main waiting area and then waited to be brought to the gate. Our lady gave us each a ticket and we had to show out ID and fan card at the door. My friend and I got in and saw out other friend waiting for us.

Now, I should mention that I packed snacks for this and not just  any snacks. I packed some gummy bears to break out in the middle of the broadcast. I totally ate them all. I knew we would be there for a while.

We took our seats and put on the wristbands that were controlled by the venue. We weren't allowed to use our lightsticks at all. (Yet other groups did and they didn't yell at them so uh...okay.) NCTzens were split us as were EXO-Ls. 

A good portion of the broadcast was prerecorded. But it was interesting to just see what happened. NCT and GOT7 only performed parts of their songs for the people at the venue while their prerecs showed on the screen. For the collab stage, we screamed super loud for them and during the Taeyong dance break that aired we started yelling ""Lee Taeyong"" even though only the venue heard it. 

Then it became time for Cherry Bomb. We screamed that fanchant and kept screaming it even after they left the stage. I was proud of how loud we were. And then, NCT was over and our involvement for the night kinda ended.

Okay, let's talk about a few of the stages that happened. 

GFriend: Fingertip is so good and will always be good.

Blackpink: [bows down to them] I love them so much. They make me so happy. I really hope YG lets them do more in 2018 because everyone was singing along at the venue. But it's YG...

Winner: Literally everyone was singing Haru Haru as well as Really, Really, Really. That song had a huge impact in Korea this past spring and everyone still adores it. 

BTOB: also known as MemeTOB. Oh their vocals! And Peniel had some hair on his head and I wanted to cry tears of happiness. That boy makes me so happy. 

Wanna One and BTS: My ears were ringing from the screams from the fans. Just ringing. So loud. I'm old. I need my hearing please. 

Red Velvet: ReVeluvs were pretty much pushed to the side and weren't heard at all which made me so angry. Peak A Boo was so good. And then they broke out the song of the summer, Red Summer and the screams. 

TWICE: I call this the chorus of male because literally all you heard were the fanboys over in their section. But they performed their bops as always.

Sunmi and her collab with Uhm Junghwa: That was so hot. I mean, any collab Sunmi does is hot in general but still. I love her so much.

Collab stages in general: Lit. 

EXO: My tired bubs who flew in from Japan overnight. They did so good. They've been going through a lot as have Red Velvet and NCT over the last week but they kept pushing on.

Overall, the Gayo was okay. I wasn't a fan of the controlled LED lights we had to wear because they only worked when they wanted to. To me, it was more of an effect and not practical if you want a venue to cheer as one. If you wanted that to happen, wouldn't it make more sense to have seas of each group happen when they perform? 

If you are still reading this, congratualtions. I'm on high alert for the MBC Gayo notice currently. But I finally crossed off ""attending a Gayo"" on my kpop bucket list.

It was beyond my colleagues and my expectation to receive so many comments. Mostly because I thought there were other post people giving their condolence in separate link.  Once the comment past 1000, it was too impractical to write every single sticky note and put it in the vigil.

So we decided to make a little scrapbook. It ended up taking longer than expected, but each page is colored in different flag with people's comment in their respective countries.  1000 comments came out to roughly 50 pages with decorations. (think of highschool year book size).

I know a editor in korea and after asking around for couple of days found a way to give it to a relative who will deliver it one of the  Shinee's member personally. So that is where the messages went. 

So that is that as for others....

there was so much comment that I stopped checking my inbox. So if you left PM requesting other stuff, i didn't check.  I'll not oblige other request of any means or reveal how/who I used to find my connections other than the info I mentioned here. I know some have good intentions, but I just cannot risk the exposure to the editor.

as for those who wish to donate financial means to me for doing this, it is quite alright. the book came out to roughly 40 USD, but its between 4 of us so ....it didn't cost much. Yes, there are some non materials reasons, but your thoughts are enough.  I appreciate the thoughts. 

Someone asked me if something similar happens will I be doing this again. Well...I lucked out because during my exchange, i knew my editor knew some people that have some connections to SM.  I am unsure what the future holds, but I honestly can't say for sure what I can achieve in the future...

I delayed a bit b/c I wasn't too sure if the book got delivered. We all have jobs so it was hard to focus 100%, but looks like it got through before new years.

that is all

thanks.

[EDIT]: It was too expensive to make it here and send it to Korea. So they made it in Korea. I only saw the demo and not the final product unfortunately. But I had a say in the covering. I decided to make it pure Chantilly white cover with glaucus color with more emphasizes on less blue tinge and trebuchet font. And instead of dates, i put..... well its a bit weird sounding in English but roughly it translate to...""born to be...until then""",55,498,False,self,,,,,

Time for the annual giveaway-for-the-purpose-of-emptying-my-cupboards. [A grand affair.](https://i.imgur.com/x1fmXfh.gifv) This year I'm staggering the giveaways a little more because I'm way too busy with work to organise it properly. First part is... small stuff.  
  
For starters, 26 lucky people will stand a chance to receive a **random** packet of **TWICE photocards**. These are the pre-order benefits that always comes with TWICE albums and contain all 9 members. To participate, simply leave a comment reply to the correct section below! I will conduct a lottery to determine who wins. **[PHOTO](https://i.imgur.com/Aqb0uvh.jpg)**  
  
  
Second, something *slightly* bigger. One person shall be the lucky winner of **[3rd gen Album Of The Year](https://i.imgur.com/mUgjp1g.jpg)**. To qualify, simply find/make me a gif that shows your feelings towards this giveaway. I will not complain about quality/size/originality/etc. Just use a URL that is reddit-friendly. I will pick my favourite and that person gets the album. Piece of Ice cream cake  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  

Notes:    
1. I will stop accepting entries 24 hours from submission of this post (30 December, 1300KST/1200SGT).  
2. I can only ship to the **Americas, Europe, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore** and **Oceania**. I've lost too many packages to other places not listed here T__T

I'm curious what groups/songs/moments/etc. got people introduced to the genre, for both new and veteren fans!! 

I am a newbie kpop fan myself, started becoming aware of it around this past spring with BTS winning the social artist award and that being all over social media (tumblr, trending on Facebook, etc.). I did check out their Wings album but wasn't really a fan (though with that being arguably their most experimental album, it probably wasn't a good way to get introduced to them--I like the Beautiful Moment EPs way more). So I kind of forgot about it until the summer when people on tumblr were talking about the new EXO album/thirstposting about their [comeback stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz6SHUbvgwo) (lol). And actually I was really impressed with their song The Eve, and The War overall. So that was my first bias group. SNSD was my second because, again, tumblr, someone was complaining about boy group stans who have never listened to Gee and I was like what is that  

Went on to binge-read a bunch of wikipedia articles, lurk this sub for like a month, and repeatedly fail my vow to remain a strictly casual kpop fan. 

Anyway sorry that was so long &amp; boring, I'm sure other people have more interesting stories lol",408,159,False,self,,,,,

If someone asks you whether you like the song, you probably wouldn't say yes.

For me it's [""Sugar and Me"" by SanE and Rania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8avNw5EWBYs). I don't even like this song, I have only looked it up on YouTube to hyperlink this, but for some reason I don't ever skip it when it comes up on Spotify playlists! It's like I completely blur out during the song and don't switch it. I also get it when K-Drama OSTs come up on playlists, I am not a ballad fan at all, but I don't hate any of them enough to skip it, I think they are all tolerable most of the time (and actually listened to all of the Reply 1988/1994/1997 OSTs when I was in a lab because it is the epitome of music that you can listen to but not focus on).

What's that one song that you don't even like, but can't skip?

Like I mentioned last week, this week's Jukebox will be a year in review of 2017's k-pop releases! But first, last week's results: we had artists like BIGBANG, WINNER, and more featured on Jukebox! The highest rated song of the last previous Jukebox was **KARA's Step with a score of 9.04!** Congrats KARA!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, come on be my love, come on be my love baby!

A lot of different songs on this week's Jukebox. Like I mentioned, it's a year in review, and there were [over 32 different artists](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7lqqgy/jukebox_15_step_it_up_love_me_love_me_and_have/drobegi/) that were considered for this Jukebox to be used as a sampling of 2017. They were all randomly numbered, and I then generated seven random numbers for the list! So, without further ado, here we go! Do you want it this love, do you want it real love? Are you going to shimmy shimmy, KoKoBop, because you like it? Are you going to call Lisa pretty and nasty? If Jinsoul walks by and says ""Hey boy"", will your weave be snatched or are you firmly not feeling it? Are you going to say no to Seohyun? Here are this week's songs!

1. [BLACKPINK - As If It's Your Last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amq-qlqbjYA)
2. [EXO - Ko Ko Bop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdssuxDdqKk)

6. [BTS - DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdVXkSdhwU)
7. [2NE1 - Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEkLHC7l25w)

You know what to do! Leave your review as a reply to the comment with the song and title. Please leave a score between 1 and 10 alongside your review. You can review one or all seven of the songs. Since all these songs have MVs, youre allowed to review the MV too but are in no way obligated to  you can totally review just the song if that's what you please!

As a gentle reminder: I do NOT pick these songs. I didn't pick these songs and as I mentioned, they were randomly generated using random.org/lists and random.org/integers. I will post screenshots in the comments of everything. Downvoting someone's response or review of a song does not change the score a song gets_, I will literally just be taking the average of all the scores given and the mean score is what I give. You have until this Friday at 11:59 PM PST to leave your comments, thoughts and reviews on these seven songs that are meant to be a sampling of 2017! And whoa, that'll be a brand new year!

After a good three months on the chart, Oh My Girl's Closer sadly leaves the Top 10 for r/kpop's Jukebox Songs. It had a good run though! And it was on there for a long time. So, as of now, SHINee's Sherlock and Married to the Music are the longest lived songs on Jukebox now that Oh My Girl has inevitably fallen off. 

That's all for now! What did you think of 2017? How do you like these songs? Do you want to do another 2017 year in review (more about this in the ""Other Business"" section) or do you want to start fresh into the New Year? Have fun reviewing, and even though 2017 has been a really weird and crazy and difficult year, I hope the remaining days left are good for you!

Like me, for example, i dont follow fan accs on my twitter but i put them into a list instead and will only check them out when i want to (so the updates wont flood my main timeline instead) &amp; i have 'specific time' for that

The reason I hate that video is because I disagree with the title of the video soooo much( and yes I did actually watch the video). I believe that 2017 showcased how strong the kpop community is and how strong it can be. Kpop is making a huge splash in the states, we had amazing comebacks and huge debuts, the big tropical house boom and of course the success of BTS. I'm not saying that 2017 was the ""best"" year in kpop(far from it) I'm just that saying that the kpop Fandom stayed strong despite our hardships such as the disbandments, the scandals and even Jonghyun's death. So I believe overall this Fandom proved that no matter what comes our way we can stay ""strong"" and get through it...2017 was bright but brighter days are ahead.
