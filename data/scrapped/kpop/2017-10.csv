#### New Buttons

When we launched r/kpoppers and refreshed r/kpophelp, we talked about making it easier to quickly bounce between subreddits.  In an effort to make that a reality, we have added [three new tabs/buttons at the top of each subreddit.](https://i.imgur.com/Aq6jJQM.jpg)  They are color-coded to each sub's primary color so that you don't forget where you are as you hop from place to place.  You will need to browse the desktop site and have subreddit style enabled in order to see the buttons.  Once again, thanks goes to /u/kilenaitor for the code and making sure it all looks perfect.  Let us know what you think of the buttons and if you've experienced any bugs or trouble using them.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Let's Get Social

For years, we've had four little round buttons in the sidebar that linked to some r/kpop social pages.  Unfortunately, some of those were forgotten about and abandoned.  Well, not any more.  We've refreshed the buttons with some new options and we hope you'll like them.

* **Twitter:** Our Twitter account, [@redditkpop](https://twitter.com/redditkpop), has been dormant for about year, but it has suddenly come back to life recently.  We're still working on it, but the plan is to Tweet out every post that reaches 100 points.  This should filter out the less popular posts and reduce the amount of spam in your Twitter feed.  So, if you don't want to miss any big stories or releases, go ahead and starting following [@redditkpop](https://twitter.com/redditkpop).  It should be fully operational very soon.

* **Discord:** We've gotten several questions from users asking about an official Discord server.  We could make one, but that seems silly when there's already a great K-Pop server with over a thousand users.  We've talked to the mods at the [.kpop Discord Server](http://www.discord.me/kpop) and agreed to promote it as an ""Unofficial Official r/kpop Server"".  The server is **NOT** owned or moderated by the subreddit mod team, so you'll need to follow their rules and be nice.  It's a great place for real-time K-Pop chat, having fun, and hanging out with other kpoppers from around the world.  A lot of our most active members and mods are already there and we even have a channel dedicated for subreddit discussion, so come join us!

* **Plug.dj:** We got a great suggestion a while back from /u/jokerr77 to create a Plug.dj room for the subreddit.  We checked it out, and [it's now live here.](https://plug.dj/kpop-reddit)  If you're not familiar with Plug.dj, it's basically a group chat room where everyone can take turns being the DJ.  You just queue up a YouTube link and everyone in the room watches and listens to the video together.  We think it will great fun to just hang out, listen to K-Pop, discover new artists, and share your favorites.  We could also use it to listen to new albums together when they drop by putting the link our Album Discussion threads and Throwback Album threads.  So come hang out and let's listen to some music!

* **IRC:** Yes, [the IRC server](http://webchat.snoonet.org/kpop) is still up and running.  If you don't like Discord, you can hop in the IRC server and chat it up with everyone else still living in 1999.  No, but seriously, it still works.  If you have any ideas that might provide more value to our users, let us know in the comments.

The new buttons for these social features are already live in the sidebar.  Check em out and give it a try.  Let us know if you have any problems or suggestions on ways we can make any of these features better.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Translating Articles

One of the downsides of following K-Pop is that a lot of information is in Korean.  Being an English-language subreddit, that makes it a bit challenging at times.  We have a rule that requires all submitted articles to be translated into English in the comments.  Here's the rule:

&gt; I.A.4 - Submitted articles that are entirely in Korean must include a full English translation or detailed summary in the comments. Single-line or Twitter translations are not sufficient. Machine translations (Google, Bing, Naver, etc.) are not permitted. Please complete the translation before posting and add it immediately to avoid the submission being removed.

There are a couple areas where users are getting hung up.  The first is Twitter posts.  Some of the more popular K-Pop Twitter accounts will post a link to an article on Naver, for instance, and include a one-sentence translation in the Tweet.  This is not sufficient to post to r/kpop.  One line translations like this provide no context and are prone to errors.  The second area is machine translations like Google, Bing, and Naver.  These are basically a joke and should not be used.  They are always wrong 100% of the time.

It boils down to this, if you don't know Korean, don't submit articles that are in Korean.  Instead, submit a link to an English K-Pop website like Soompi, Koreaboo, AKP, or a full translation from a fansite/Twitter.  There are lots of sites out there translating K-Pop news into English, so use them.  If you can't find the article in English, just wait a bit.  If it's important news, it will appear in English soon enough and you can submit it.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Copy/Pasting Full Articles

Occasionally, users or bots transcribe full articles in the comments section.  This is done for a variety of reasons, but we feel that this is a pretty clear cut example of piracy, so we will be removing copy/paste transcriptions unless it's a translation.  We understand that there are certain sites that users don't want to visit or give clicks, but that does not make it okay to steal their content.  Instead, you should simply submit articles from other sources.  You can also add links to other websites covering the story in the comments as an alternative for users who don't want to visit the original link.  We realize copy/paste bots have been around a long time on Reddit, but it seems hypocritical of us to allow this blatant content theft while being tough on others.  Let us know how you feel about this change in the comments.


&amp;nbsp;

#### Signed Album Sales

Normally links to purchase albums are forbidden, but we have an exception for signed albums from MWave called ""Meet &amp; Greet"".  It's recently been brought to our attention that MWave also offers limited-time signed albums that are **not** ""Meet &amp; Greet"".  We think it's in the spirit of the rule to extend that exception to these albums also.  Additionally, there are some other sites that occasionally sell signed albums like [Yesasia](http://www.yesasia.com/us/gfriend-mini-album-vol-5-repackage-rainbow-all-members-autographed/1062008374-0-0-0-en/info.html).  Should we also extend the exception to this or any other websites?  If you guys want links to legitimate signed albums, we'll allow them to be posted, but let us know what sites we should allow or if you want these exceptions at all.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Census 2017

After some delays, we're excited to announce that the 2017 Census will begin on Monday, October 9th.  Submissions will be open for three weeks and will close at the end of October.  We know that a lot of people are looking forward to it and seeing how our demographics and tastes have changed over the last year.  Our subscriber base has more than tripled in the last year, so it will be interesting to see how many of those folks are still here and who they are.  We hope that everyone will take a few minutes to fill out the survey when it goes live.  It will take less than 5 minutes and will be fun to look at the results.


&amp;nbsp;


#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",84,40,False,self,,,,,

Ever since I got into kpop, I've been telling my friend if someone from Bigbang ever sets foot to this continent again, I'm going, so when they announced that Gd's tour will have a European leg it wasn't even a question. I've been debating between Berlin and London, because I've been in London before, but in the end decided on Berlin because it was cheaper (the tickets and the travelling too), it was on a Saturday so I don't have to miss uni, and the last European date so it somehow felt more special. 

**before the concert**:

I took an overnight train (13 hours) to Berlin because that was the most convenient and cheap option (I spent all my money on the ticket because I wanted standing). Not the best decision of my life, I forgot my neck pillow. It still hurts a little.

Live Nation Germany was not on top of this situation. There was a lot of confusion with the information about what are we exactly allowed to take inside (I won't go into details because it's long and frustrating and probably boring and turned out okay in the end thanks to the volunteers, who organized the fan project and were helping so much), and the numbering was such a mess. They told us two days before the concert that the numbering will begin on the 29 in the evening, so I thought I better hurry to the venue from the station. When I got there I was told that regular standing will not have numbering in the end because they messed something up yesterday so just line up. That was the point I decided that it doesn't matter, VIP gold, silver, and the front of stage people are in front of me anyway and I'm quite tall, and there are big screens so whatever, I come back an hour before the gates open at 6 and in the meantime I'm sightseeing a little and take a shower, maybe a nap in the hostel. Ended up not sleeping because I made friends with two polish girls who were in the same room as me so we talked kpop, ate and went to see the Wall memorial. They had seating tickets, so we only got back to the venue at six, but boy it was such a mess. There were people everywhere, they had to call the police to control the traffic because there was construction going on next to the arena and they couldn't fit the lines so we were standing on the road. I asked security and they told me that there aren't separate lines for seating and standing, just get in one, and once I'm inside I can find my place whether it is seating or standing. When it was 6:30 and no one was moving it became pretty evident that the show will be late (it was supposed to start at 8), because there was no way they can let that much people in with the crazy security they had in 90 minutes. And soundcheck only began at 7. Around 7:45 they started to let us in and it was nearly an hour before I got in. They were playing Gd's mvs on the screen on repeat, and Breath is good and all, but not the 3rd time in a row, when you almost can't because teenage girls have no concept of personal space (I was prepared for this of course but found it a little funny). 

**the concert** (the songs are probably not in perfect order and I'm not doing the total set list I'm sorry):

Around 9, the MV for Crooked started playing and the crowd was going crazy and then it was suddenly dark and Heartbreaker started and he appeared. I thought I was prepared, but I don't think you can be. My first thought was that he is so small, and then the second that it was already worth it. I saw so many fancams of him being on the stage but it's just different live. That man has so much stage presence, I can't even describe it. The way he moves, it's so relaxed I was afraid he will fall apart or something, and he can entertain his audience. It's like the stage is full even when he is alone on it.

He was in a super good mood, even started shooting finger hearts during This love, and did the pointing thing during Missing you. He was asking us to 'scream' and to 'make some noise' (like we wasn't doing it like crazy people anyways) and asking if we are enjoying it because he does (he's such a cutie at heart). During his greeting he even tried to speak German (I think in the end he only said Guten abend? I don't speak German so I had no idea if there was anything else).
During the 'who is Kwon Jiyong to you' vcr I said to myself not to scream at every familiar figure but then Daesung appeared on the screen and I was a goner. Well, at least I tried.
Michigo, One of a kind and Crayon were so good live, it was such a party, and this is why I love standing so much, you can jump and shake your lightstick as much as you like. During I love it he unbuttoned his jacket (the screams for that, my poor ears) and he is still so skinny, but at least you can't count his ribs anymore.

Then his new album. I love every song from it, but Bullshit was the one that I loved a little less. Well not anymore! The way he performs it, it adds so much, and is perfect. Despite all the confusion with the banners, the fanproject was a[ total success](https://twitter.com/MBArenaBerlin/status/914224777719672833)! They were two sided, one for Middle fingers up (other for untitled) that literally said [Middle fingers up!](https://imgur.com/Qgn2o4M) He really liked it, made a little gesture to signal that he read them, saluted, and then was randomly shouting middle fingers up a couple times during the rest of the concert. During Divina Commedia we tried to start a red ocean but it kind of failed because people were just using their phones lights, but is was still okay.

During his talk he was more in a teasing mood, not that much shy giddy like some concerts (but he had his moments). Some funny/moving things he said besides the usual:

'I turned 30 this year in Korean age. I'm not a boy anymore, I'm a man. I'm a man, YO!' (yes, if you say it like that Jiyong, it's totally convincing)

*talking about his new album and concept* 'I was afraid you wouldn't understand me, but that's BULLSHIT' (he legit shouted it, it was so funny)

'it's so strange, being G-Dragon for 10 years and now suddenly hearing you calling me Kwon Jiyong' (crowd was chanting Kwon Jiyong every chance they got, even during some songs, it was a little much)

He tried to say something about 'my boys bigbang' but the crowd started shouting and screaming so he gave up, and started just saying it again, so it was like Bigbang! *sream* Bigbang! *scream* back and forth.

He also spoke about how this is his first time in Berlin, but he hopes to come back, and that this concert feels a bit special because it's the last one in Europe. 

Encore Crooked was such a party, he was bothering his band and the dancers during it, and overall enjoying himself. Then he sang Untitled. It was beautiful. It's such an emotional song, it shows that it means a lot to him. We held up our banners again, this time they said[    ](https://imgur.com/MuQ5DBO) (even in my next life, I'm a Kwon Jiyong fan). And then it was over.
I managed to get a poster from the venue, and was so happy in general that I forgot they might not let me take it on the plane without folding it, but Airberlin didn't care so [it's safe now](https://imgur.com/q86gU3A).

I spent less than 24 hours in Berlin, but it was worth every cent, and probably one of the best concerts of my life. If you have a chance to see him, go, you won't regret it.

(sorry if this is long and confusing, it's my first fan account and I wrote it on the airport and the plane and didn't sleep much since friday) ",33,103,False,self,,,,,

  Warning, a few spoilers about the status of some of the idols are below  

**KBS Idol Rebooting Program - The Unit**

- 200+ reported idols and entertainers who have either released an album or have broadcast experience take the stage again in hopes of a second chance at success
- Only 63 males and 63 females will make it past the open auditions being held September 29 - October 1 (now completed)
- During the live auditions, audience members are given a pass/fail remote.
- Idols can pass one of two ways; either have a mentor pass them or have 90% of the audience pass them.
- If an idol does not pass the audition stage, they are eliminated from the show.
- 7 teams of 9 will then be made for each gender and they will participate in missions together.
- 9 males and 9 females will survive until the end
- Each gender's winners will promote as a group for 7 months

I wanted to go to this festival the moment it was announced and saw that 127 would be there. It was also falling on the same day as when I first saw Johnny at Spectrum last year. But I also saw the whole line up and mentally prepared myself for war if Wanna One was on the same day as 127. Luckily the kpop gods loved me (and others) and put them on different days. [I've discussed my issues with Wanna One before in a previous fan account I wrote] However, ticketing for this was hell in a handbasket. Most of my friends who went bought their tickets from re-sellers. Last week on a whim I went on Trazy and saw they had foreigner tickets for the event and the day NCT would be there. SO I BOUGHT THE DAMN TICKET. I also booked a hostel nearby the venue so I wouldn't have to fight the train mess later when the concert ended. 

Sunday morning I arrived at the ticket booth at 5 am. I heard that the day before was a mess. There were so many issues. I was technically the 3rd in line for Trazy. 2 other girls overnighted because of the whole mess from the day before. More of us showed up and we started making pacts that we would help each other if we got separated. Those pacts were broken later. After I got my ticket, I had to go and enter the huge ass line of ticket-wristband exchange. Everyone who was doing standing had to do that. But the foreigner section was in front of that so hopefully it would all be good. 

The end of the line was all the way in a parking lot next to the venue and started to snake around a lot. At 10 am they started exchanging the tickets for wristbands. We all got up and started following the line and then when we got past this fence hell began. Everyone ran. And  mean everyone. It was chaos. Pure chaos. It was like Black Friday Shopping meets the Running of the Bulls. But it was all fangirls and fanboys. Our foreigner pact promises were broken during this run. We just kept running and running. Then, we were forced to stop. We were being held back by security into different sections. We had a little check point in which security had us hold our tickets up so they could confirm we actually had tickets. Then they let us go by rows of 6's. We had to wait for a while before going to the next section which again was us being put into rows. Then it began to rain. We kept walking and I looked and saw that we were at the steps towards the stadium. We were almost there. But it also started to rain. No big deal. We put on jackets, umbrellas, ponchos, blankets. But suddenly we stopped moving. It started to pour. But were we moving? Nope. We were standing in the pouring rain for 1 hour. [it was also during this time when I found out Hansol had left SM] It got to the point where we started to scream at staff to let us in. Those who were closer to the window started to scream as well. So we took turns. It was great. It was 1 pm. Concert started at 6 pm. We were losing it. After forever, they started letting people in again. We were controlled by sections once we reached the ground. As we got closer to the ticket exchange, we started to push. Finally, I got to the front and waved my ticket and they led me to the foreigner exchange. I got my wristband and was pushed towards the security where we were just pushed through. I held up my wrist and got into the venue and was directed to the foreigner section. I picked the right side to stand. Bad idea. 

At first, it was okay. We were able to sit down. But then we were forced to stand up. I looked around and realized I was gonna be in the middle of a sea of fansites. I ran into a Doyoung fansite I know from promotions and she went to the other side, the left. I should have followed because that side had more Johnny interaction. 

Around 3 pm, they had some of the artists come out and read letters from fans at the concert. Then, they called them on the phone. It was really cool. At 4 pm, the red carpet happened and they aired it for us. I died when I saw 127 show up. And I literally started to die when I saw what Johnny was wearing. (Who gave you the right?????) I ended up becoming friends with 3 foreigners and we all helped each other during the concert. This came in handy later. 

5 pm came and then it became 6 pm. 127 was the first group to come out but since I knew I was in a sea of fansites, I knew I wouldn't be able to fangirl properly. Right away, pushing happened. Yup. I expected it. I was pushed into a pile of bags and that ended up being my spot for the night. I had to decide right then and there if I would be helping fansites. I ended up having to do that. I was by 3 B1A4 fansites and they were all super nice. I will say that the NCTzen fanchants were super loud. I AM SO PROUD OF US. WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A MAIN SECTION IN THE STAND. [EXO-Ls most likely helped us though since they have agreed in a way to support NCT since they know a lot of NCT is close with EXO. Thank you EXO-Ls.]

I really couldn't see much of the concert because of the fansite sea. For some of the groups, not that many cameras were up. When NU'EST W came out though...the screams. I almost cried. I was so happy for the boys. They deserve everything. And I mean everything. There were two NU'EST sites by me and once they finished, they left. FT Island was probably the most chill because the fansites didn't care. The girl next to me was a huge Pris and started to sob when Love Sick happened. Same girl. Her friend was a huge Red Velvet fan and he loved Seulgi. His hands started to shake when they came out because it was the first time he was seeing them so close. [I love these types of moments during concerts. It's beautiful.]

When Sunmi came on, the fansites went fdjhsdjhjkfhsdf because she's the Queen right now. When it was B1A4's turn I was doing the fanchants with the fansites. But when it was time for TWICE...fansite sea. Fansite sea. But the worst happened when I expected it. EXO-CBX. The amount of pushing during that time. One of the fansites almost fell down so the girl I was by and I held her up. I also started holding up a a fansite next to me and used my back to help the girls behind me. As I also expected, it became an EXO concert when CBX came on stage. I saw a little bit of their performance but once again, I was in a sea of fansites.

When it was over, so many of the fansites rushed to leave. But since there were streams of plastic on a lot of us, people were getting caught. I looked at the ground and it was a mess. A lot of stools were broken.

I ran into a few of the foreigners I was talking to before as we waited in line and asked if they had fun. ""No. Fansites are awful."" This is when I break it down to simple English: fansites are mostly foreigners. They can be in that section. They take the pictures of your bias. The cocnert isn't a relaxing thing for them. It's all business. I knew this coming into this from other events but most of these foreigners have never experienced this. It's not like concerts back home. Here it's business. 

Anyway, I had fun in a strange way. The whole thing was a mess. My feet killed after it was over. But I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just stick to fandom sections for now own if they are officially organized. I'm getting way too old for this foreigner stuff now. ",7,40,False,self,,,,,

P101 S2's Wanna One and Sixteen's TWICE blew up; P101 S1's I.O.I. as well as YG's Winner and iKon have had success but not to the same extent; and Boys24 has arguably been a flop so far.

So with The UNIT, Stray Kids, and MIXNINE coming up soon, I'm curious which resulting groups will even be successful, and what factors will contribute. Also, what makes a survival show in itself popular?

* Production network? Mnet produced both Idol School and P101, but Idol School didn't get nearly as much hype. However, we still have to see how fromis_ will do.
* Management? Wanna One I think has had much improved management and budget compared to I.O.I, so maybe that's why they've had more success so far.
* Temporary vs. Permanent Group? Does Wanna One have so much popularity because people know they're a temporary group, so everyone's trying to enjoy them before they disband?
* Good songs/concepts?
* Show format?
* Individual popularity?
* Pure luck?

Let me know what other factors you guys think affect the group's success!",107,75,False,self,,,,,

N.B. For those who don't know, the major changeup with the charts was that songs could only enter the charts between 12pm to 6pm KST. 

What I have noticed

1. Artists with strong charting history (IU, GD, Bolbalgan4) have performed incredibly well, perhaps even more strongly than pre-reform
2. To have longevity in the charts, the song must hit the top 10, and preferably top 5 on the first night of release. Once songs go in there, the top 10 appears to get sealed in more or less
3. On the contrary, once songs leave the top 10, they waterslide down the charts quite rapidly, unless they have a strong 'brand appeal' aka big3 or digital monsters and even so thats not guaranteed
4. It seems that one of the motives of the reform was to block boy groups from lining up all their songs (titles and B sides) in the charts following the release of new music and yet you look at the charts, its clogged as ever, especially at nighttime.
5. The biggest victims, I feel like, are the mid tier girl groups. It now seems incredibly difficult to chart in the top 100 and stay there, whereas previously, due to 12am KST releases, more GGs were able to find success 

What might be worth changing

Get rid of the 5 minute chart, and possibly even real-time charts. This is probably one of the driving forces to fandom streaming especially by boy groups 24 hours a day as fans can titrate their efforts based on the trendlines that are graphed every 5 minutes. Same with the real time chart as well, it is also strongly affected by fandom streaming. By getting rid of these two elements of the charts, I think the charts would better reflect the preferences of the general listening public, and also lessen the insane competition between fandoms that often seems to come to light.

I am also becoming quite a fan of The Cosmic Girls, they have been around for a year and bit now. I thought I would just do a quick post to share some interesting similarities between the two groups.

The Cosmic Girls are also known as WJSN, similar to how Girls Generation is known as SNSD. Both abbreviations are the initials of the each group's Korean name written in Roman letters. The SN in both names stands for 'girl' in Korean.

The groups are also very large. I remember when SNSD first came out it took me a while to remember all nine of their names. WJSN is slightly larger, but you do slowly get to learn their names, it does help that they are broken up into subgroupings.

Also, both groups were relatively unknown when they started out. It was only really when Girls Generation released Gee that they made it big. When they started out the Wonder Girls a JYP Entertainment group were much more famous at the time.  Girls Generation really stuck at it and worked hard over the years to finally get where they are today.

Cosmic Girls are just starting out and slowly but steadily growing. They haven't quite had a hit as big as Gee yet. But I'm sure it will come. Also, similarly the most famous girl group, when they were starting out, is another JYP Entertainment group Twice. 

Granted the Cosmic Girls have a lot of work to do before they get close Girl's Generation fame. But I have a good feeling that they will one day.",26,0,False,self,,,,,

BTS have accomplished a great thing and are truly rising in every sense of the word on the musical stage both domestically and internationally.  To the point that they're even getting radio play now.  And this is all well and good but there's something that I wonder more importantly than any of that.  

What comes after BTS?  See, I see all around ""Oh wow Kpop is becoming more accepted"" or ""regular people can listen to kpop now"" and this is all well and good, but this is really all from one group.  What I'm thinking about how now that we have this achievement from this one group, I have to wonder what will be ""the second BTS""?  And this is where I think things get interesting.  Sure we've got all of this with one kpop group, but what happens with the next one that gets close to this big or even bigger?  Will it be in a 5-7 years or could it be even sooner?  Will there be a voting rivalry on the level of MAMA but for the BBMAs of TWO kpop groups someday?  Will there be another group that manages to get radio play.  Because at that point, Kpop would really start becoming less of a novelty and more of a thing that people really might be looking at.  

That's why this is all starting to feel really exciting because it feels like with similar big international acts like Wonder Girls or Psy, they got really high but ultimately things pulled back and kpop just kept rolling on its own.  But what if things don't pull back going forward.  I recall an article posted here with an interview with a CEO(?) of CJ E&amp;M who said something like how they're waiting for Kpop to have it's Michael Jackson moment, where he referred to the idea of something becoming truly global.  I think that moment has never been closer.

There were some really big comebacks this month (like BTS album Love Yourself), but I opted for artists that werent as well-known because they deserve more exposure and also because pretty much everyones listened to DNA by now. If you listen to K-Pop, youve probably heard of some of these artists before, but if you havent, I think youll really like them! Lets check some out.

--- 

[R&amp;B / Soul] [Jang Jane, Yoon Jong Shin - Amateur](https://youtu.be/vLl36jnsElg)
&gt;Jang Janes voice is just something else. When I stumbled across her EP Liquid last year, I knew I had come across something incredibly special.

&gt;Amateur, a collaboration between singer-songwriters Jang Jane and Yoon Jong Shin, tells the story of a love relationship as compared to the weather. The lyrics are a tad ambiguous, but it seems that Jang Jane is telling herself to not give up on love like an amateur: dont change your feelings as rashly as the weather changes.

&gt;Its a lovely, unique song that really stood out to me. I hope you like it! Korean lyrics [here](https://klyrics.net/yoon-jong-shin-jang-jane-amateur/).

[Rap / Trap] [NO:EL - KILLINGTRACK (feat. QUAIMO, Jay Moon)](https://youtu.be/iH16vhC6voc)
&gt;Dont know who NO:EL is? Now you do.

&gt;Hes got a checkered past. The former High School Rapper contestant was embroiled in controversy earlier this year due to a prostitution bullying scandal. The rapper, who garnered praise on the TV show due to this rap skills and good looks, ultimately stepped down from the show after news and screenshots of his past actions and words about his family and others spread like wildfire.

&gt;Of course, a musicians music cant be separated from who they are: a musicians music comes from who they are. Despite this, though, I think KILLINGTRACK is a great track from ELLEONOEL that really captures not only NO:ELs incredible rap skills but also the spirit and mood of rap music.

&gt;Its a relatively recent release, so I couldnt find any Korean or English lyrics for it yet. Regardless, I think it goes hard, and any hip-hop/rap lovers should find it enjoyable.

[Dance / Pop] [LOONA Odd Eye Circle - Girl Front](https://youtu.be/tyInv6RWL0Q)
&gt;LOONA (stylized as LOO) is a girl group/project in which a member (out of a total of twelve) is introduced each month through either a single or a sub-unit. Odd Eye Circle is the second sub-unit to come from LOONA, and it consists of JinSoul, Choerry, and Kim Lip (from left to right). Girl Front is the title and second track on the mini album Mix &amp; Match.

&gt;Im quite particular about girl groups, but I REALLY like LOONA. Im not sure if Im a stan yet, but they have so much going on for them that Im excited to see what else they have in store.

&gt;I think I get turned off by girl groups when theyre too sugary and sweet. I dont mind sugary and sweet, but like dessert, anything in excess is too much. Which is why I like LOONA  they own their femininity without making it unpalatable.

&gt;Girl Front is a really nice mixture of dance, pop, electronica, and R&amp;B. Theres a definite hook (Im caught), the dancing is dynamic and entrancing, and the girls transition really nicely between singing and rapping. The rapping really fits as well  it doesnt stand out like a sore thumb the way some raps in R&amp;B songs do. Ill probably have this on repeat for a while. How about you?

[Hip-Hop] [Sik-K - h1ghr gang (feat. pH-1, Jay Park)](https://youtu.be/_yhvkqz3ItQ)
&gt;Sik-Ks back with some great-sounding genre-bending hip-hop music. The H1GHR MUSIC rapper teams up with fellow label mates pH-1 and Jay Park to bring some straight fire in h1ghr gang.

&gt;BOYCOLD, produced by the eponymous producer, is Sik-Ks third EP. The mini album is made up of five tracks, and h1ghr gang is the last one. The song begins with a nice, minor piano groove followed by the rhythmic beat and pH-1s verse. He lays out some clever rhymes (e.g. you aint never gonna like me / welcome to my show, you should come and sight see) as well as subtle references (e.g. Kid Cudis Day N Night).

&gt;I personally liked the first track from the album,   (Your Night), better, but since its too similar in sound and genre as Jang Janes Amateur, I decided this would be a better fit.

[Jazz / R&amp;B] [Junho - Fine](https://youtu.be/kpryzZPDaMY)
&gt;This right here is a real gem. These are the kind of songs that I like the most: laid-back and chill but also exquisitely and harmonically fresh.

&gt;The song drew me in immediately due to its smooth and jazzy chord progression. However, I fell even deeper in love with it upon learning how Junho wrote the song Lambo, his cat who passed away in early April. I suddenly understood the agonizing pain that went into the composition of Fine as well as the dawning hope that gleamed underneath it all. I dont know how youre feeling today, but I hope that youll be fine as well.

[Special Mention] [IU - Last Night Story](https://youtu.be/cxcxskPKtiI)
&gt;Special mention time! Always my favorite time.

&gt;So as I mentioned in the beginning, I dont usually like to bring back artists more than once or highlight artists who are already well-known because other artists could receive more exposure. However, I took an exception with Last Night Story from IUs recent mini album, Flower Bookmark 2, because it was vintage and showcased a side to Korean music that hasnt been heard of in a long time.

&gt;This late-80s disco and dance-style bop was first sung and released by the first Korean boy group ever, Firetruck (). This song (which Ive linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xwe4tXnajo)) was an immediate success; they quickly skyrocketed to fame and stardom. This type of sound is almost never heard anymore in Korean music, which is why I think IU deserves applause for bringing it back into the mainstream consciousness.

&gt;Well, unfortunately thats all for this post. At least it ended on a good (disco) point!

* This is the seventh installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! 
**Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Bands**!

* Any song by a Korean band.
* Any style. Any genre.
* Also songs that include band instruments. Like guitar, drums, etc. So very little to no electronic sounds. (That's why I added Sentimental even if Winner is not a band.)
* They can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [Winner - Sentimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV9NJGTLm-4)
* [Day6 - Congratulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3sFsHrUyLQ)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

WINNER had the mega hype of being the successor group to Bigbang, but then goes into an eighteen month hiatus, which is an eternity in today's social media world. I think they've released excellent songs this year, but after NTH's exit it feels like their momentum has an unbreakable glass ceiling. It doesn't help that Jinwoo will have to enlist in 2020.

Aside from a low key single, IKON also had an eighteen month hiatus from Korean activities. Aside from Japan, iKON seems to be pretty lukewarm overall. They were labeled as the 'B team' from the start, which also doesn't help matters.

Last but not least, Lee Hi. I choked up a bit when she appeared on JYP's Party People. She had that ungodly long three year hiatus prior to Seoulite, and now another nineteen month hiatus.

In an age where top groups are having comebacks every six months like clockwork, I don't think YG can afford to continue this promotional strategy.",102,123,False,self,,,,,

Rather, I meant ""If someone left your fave group, maybe after their contract ends, who would be your best guess?"" So you don't need to tell me ""No one's ever leaving XX because they all love each other!"" To add, you can also suggest who you think would be least likely to leave.  

For example, I feel like of all the members of Exo, if someone left the group, it would be D.O. I think his personality is really ill-suited for idol life, to the point where I wonder what made him become an idol other than his passion for singing. He's always seemed really withdrawn and I think he's talked about how he actually gets stage fright. He shies away a lot from attention, and he even mentioned on Knowing Bros how his dream is to live a quiet life as a farmer. 

And recently on Party People, he talked about how he hates not being able to walk down the streets without any attention. Of course this is something most idols dislike, but it just really felt like a genuine concern coming from D.O. He also has an active acting career going on for him, so that's something he'd fall back on if he stops being an idol. 

Of course, I doubt he'd actually leave Exo, but hypothetically speaking, I think he'd be the most likely member. Let me know if you agree/disagree, and how you feel about other groups as well.

EDIT: Okay don't use this as a chance to bash certain members. This discussion isn't about who you'd like to see leave based on your own personal reasons.",233,120,False,self,,,,,

But have you ever got interested in a group for something completely unexpected?  For me I have two.  

-I saw my first SVT MV Mansae and thought it was alright but when I looked up the members, I saw one of them was called ""The8"".  ""The8?  What the heck kind of name is that?"" I asked.  I kid you not, I think I looked up info on this strangely named idol for like a straight half hour.  This led to me getting into the rest of the group.  But seriously though, The8. (he's not even my bias on that note, it's Seungkwan)  

-At one time when I went to New York Comic Con, I was touring the booths and I saw my first, what I now understand to be, Kpop music video.  It was actually 4 different videos playing on repeat.  I don't remember what two of them were but I know one of them was Hyuna's Bubble Pop and the other was SNSD's Gee.  And man when I saw Gee, I was absolutely floored beyond belief.  Like, you don't understand, I was just knocked out.  I would walk by the booth every so often just to see if they were playing Gee again so I could watch it.  When I got home, I looked up everything about Gee and watched a lot of performances of it.  Including this [Team Fortress 2 ""mix"" of the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJmu_Q0uRgU). Eventually I stopped freaking out about it since I didn't fall into the Kpop hole until years later but I will never forget when I found Gee.

A little background on myself. I've listened to Kpop since 2009, followed most of the major groups back then (SNSD, Big Bang, DBSK, SUJU, WG), but faded off a little after 2014 - 2015. Now I still do listen to comebacks from the older artists that I really like (IU, Ailee, AkMu, etc) and I do listen to some newer groups (Twice, BTS - I know they aren't new but their popularity skyrocketed in the last few years). 

My question is more on the culture of Kpop. I've been reading multiple discussion threads and I always see stuff about idols having to conform to certain expectations, or having to 'please' netizens/etc, idols getting flammed/bashed for things many of us would consider minor. 

I was just wondering. Why does Kpop have this culture of idols having such insane expectations/obedience, compared to artists around the world, who are arguably far bigger and would have a more significant impact on youths. For example, Selena Gomez/Justin Bieber. If we held them to the same standards of Kpop, they would be screwed over 10x. I know they do get their fair share of hate, but they seem to be able to brush it off and carry on(even if it affects them emotionally), but in Kpop if an idol gets targeted for whatever reason, it instantly ruins their career to a huge extent. 

I thought it was only cause netizens/people on the internet generally want to be toxic to people they don't know as they understand there usually is no repercussion(unless rare cases such as sexual harassment of idols like Suzy, etc). But there are toxic people everywhere in the internet, so why does the netizens have such huge weightage in their toxic comments VS other idol cultures in other countries? ",36,30,False,self,,,,,

220,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-10-5,2017,10,5,11,74d8vc,self.kpop,October Town Hall Followup,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/74d8vc/october_town_hall_followup/,Kilenaitor,1507172108,"### What Happened
Last week in our [October Town Hall](/r/kpop/comments/73jqoa/town_hall_october_2017/) 
we announced a rule change: we were banning article body contents from being
pasted into comments on posts. Since we are a moderation
team for this community, and we answer to you, the subscribers, **we are going
with your feedback and rolling back this change**.

However, we'd like a chance to explain how we came to this rule and answer
a few common questions we've seen across the town hall thread.

### Rationale
Despite popular opinion, this was not in response to any organizations reaching out to 
us and asking us to enforce the rule. That's not how we roll as a moderation team;
we answer to you all, not companies (other than reddit of course &lt;3).

The idea for the rule was born out of our desire to be considerate of the content 
creators in our community. Article contents are considered bodies of work 
and _are_ copyrighted. By copying article contents into comments, 
that effectively is rehosting the article body on reddit (rather than simply linking to it).

While providing a source is nice, it still discourages users from clicking
through to sites. Sites generate revenue from a combination of advertisement
impressions and page views. More traffic means more leverage which gives
opportunities for sponsored content and other partnerships. Advertisements
obviously directly lead to income. We felt it would be in the content-creators'
best interest that we try and direct traffic to their sites instead of
having it all sit in the reddit thread for the article. The hope was that
not only would the page get traffic they deserve, but that people would
be more inclined to read the article as well.

So, again, this was not for nefarious reasons. Are some sites clickbaity? Sure.
But the hope was that other sources could be linked which would be a net
positive to those sites as well.

### Going Forward
We have reverted the stance on the rule. But, even though the rule is gone,
we do implore you to be considerate of content creators. This is not meant
to open the floodgates and have every article pasted in the comments of every
post. We understand there are certain sites that are deceitful in their
headlines or are terrible to browse on mobile, but we also know there are
lots of sites where that's _not_ the case.

So while it is no longer against the rules, we still think the principle is important.

### Other Business
One rule change we forgot to include in the town hall was an update to
the rule on direct image posts. The reason the rule is there is so that we
don't turn into r/kpics. However, with the recent influx in charts and
infographics being posted, we decided to reword the rule to permit these
kinds of content.

The new rule reads

&gt; I.A.6 - Images and gifs/gyfs of idols that are not teasers or announcements should be posted to r/kpics or r/kpopgyfs.

### New Business
If you have any other feedback, please let us know. We really do listen
and genuinely have the community's best interest at heart. Thank you.",13,48,False,self,,,,,

We are living in an ideal world, a place were quality is valuated as much as prestige and notoriety, your magnum opus are still kicking and screaming, but there's a place for every group to aim at sucess. Here's your chance to play whichever deitity you want and make South Korea open their eyes (#BuyThe7thSenseOniTunes)

So here's the deal. SNUPER. ""Platonic Love"".

To this day it still haunts me that they didn't get popular with a comeback as strong as this one. It was the complete package. 

Nostalgia? You've got it. Visuals? Take a look. An amazing song? Do you really need to ask? Choreography? I'm tired simply by looking at them.

Yet here we are, fast forward to 2017 and we have the members participating in a reality show for a chance at redemption. 

Can I say the same about 9MUSES? I can't actually, they should have gotten first wins, second wins, thousand and one wins with the discography they harvested (is that actually a word?)

But just to be fair with the topic, I feel like they should have gotten their first win with ""Ticket"", for almost the same reasons I stated with ""Platonic Love"".

So, which are your picks? Educate this angsty nugu-lover and don't make him feel like a LOONATIC (#BuyGirlFrontOniTunes)",137,92,False,self,,,,,

Many journalists in Korea have written features about egregious abuses of power in their entertainment industry by CEO's, producers, and other men in high ranking entertainment positions, soliciting sexual favors in exchange for a professional advantage. Perhaps one of the most high profile cases was revealed in the wake of [Jang Jayeon's suicide](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/01/south-korea-entertaiment-jang-jayeon) shedding light on the horrifying degradation and abuses she suffered as a function of her job. To pretend this isn't a major problem in Hallyu today would be naive. How long until Korean entertainment's dirtiest secret is exposed?

No physical sales, was only released digitally

Disclaimer: Other than her pre-release single ""Autumn morning"", the songs were released at the end of the week. Due to Chuseok holiday, Gaon did not provide sales for last week, which means the chart positions and counts for these songs only represent **1 day** since release. I unfortunately can't provide 2nd week positions because of the holiday but I will update once Gaon returns. The digital music charts updated throughout the holiday so those numbers represent both weeks.

**Currently Active Projects:** (in order based on project end date - given in KST)


**[LIMESODA Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_limesoda/)**

* Date Project Ends: October 30, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is LIMESODA?

LIMESODA is a duo signed to D Maker Entertainment that debuted on July 12 with the song ""[ZZZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq5vqNeuI30)"". Not much is written about them in english, but one of members Hyerim participated in KPOP Star 6, where she was placed in the group KWINs (which were runners-up that season). According to OneHallyu, 2 more members are slated to be added to the group's lineup later in year, but no further news has been mentioned about that on official channels.

**[B.I.G Fan Meeting Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_bigfanmeeting/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 2, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes

Who is B.I.G?

B.I.G (which stands for Boys in Groove) is a five member group signed to GH Entertainment. The group debuted in 2014 with the song [Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp2emtZWc_k). According to the interwebs, many of the members came from music backgrounds prior to joining the group. Gunmin and Heedo trained at the Plug In Music Academy, Benji attended Julliard, and Minpyo (who also trained at Plug In Music Academy) was a member of Underdogg when the group was at Stardom. The group didnt start getting more notice until their single [1.2.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MKp9dtH3eI), which was released without Minpyo (who was taking a break due to health issues at the time). The 1.2.3 comeback also had a [Makestar campaign]( https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_big?locale=en) attached to it and was highly successful, earning 402% over their initial asking price. Their most recent single [Hello Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McqEt2pQEh0) (which includes Minpyo) came out May 23, 2017.


**[Real Smell Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_realsmell/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 9, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Real Smell?

Real Smell is a solo artist (signer/songwriter) signed to MAPCREW, who debuted in 2013 in the band Common Ground, a [Korean Funk Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIH6BJe32IY). This project is a collaboration between Makestar and Voicecovery, but beyond that I haven't been able to find anything else about him - at least not in English.

**[Apple.B Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_appleb/)**

*  Date Project End: November 13, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Apple.B?

Apple.B is a very new group, having debuted August 1, 2017 with the song []( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivFyyllBSE)"". Like B.I.G, they are also signed to GH Entertainment. The group consists of 5 members, and seems to be going with a cheerleading style concept if their Makestar page is any indication. Besides their personality quirks and basic info on each member (the standard age, position, blood type), nothing else of note has really been written about them in English.


**[EXID 5th Anniversary Photobook](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_exid/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 13, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is EXID?

[Relevent Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXID), but short version: (due to pretty much everyone on the sub knowing who EXID is) EXID is a 5 member girl group who initially debuted in 2012 to lackluster success. It wasn't until a fancam of member Hani performing their single ""Up and Down"" in 2014 that made the group go viral, giving the group the big break they needed.


**[P.O.P New Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_pop/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 20, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is P.O.P?

P.O.P is also a very new girl group, having debuted July 26 with the song [Catch You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZM7mmDKQQ). The group has currently has five members (though they debuted with 6) and is signed to DWM Entertainment Company. Due to there not being a lot written about them in English, Im not sure if debuting member Yeonha is on hiatus or if she has left the group. Although not much has been written about them in English, they have an active [youtube channel]( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQ_3LxyLJ8Z9C5s1GdlF4g/videos?pbjreload=10). 



**[The Rose Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 21, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is The Rose?

The Rose is a 4 male rock band from J&amp;Star Entertainment. Also a relatively new group, they debuted on August 3 with the single [Sorry]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXcpLWB2eBA)"". According to OneHallyu, the group writes, composes, and arranges their own songs. The groups name is said to come from the idea that there are many different color roses, so the group wants to be like a rose and show off many different musical colors. The fandom name is Black Rose.

While I couldnt verify the information, the info section of the groups OH thread says that Doojoon, Jaehyeong, and Hajoon met via busking (they started performing under the name Windfall), and Woosung was offered the chance to join by Doojoon due hearing about his music skills via a mutual friend. Funnily enough, Woosung was a trainee at J&amp;Star preparing for a solo debut, but brought up the band concept to the labels CEO, and after a successful performance by the 4 members, the CEO signed the remaining 3 and formed The Rose.

They have an active [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bandtherose/).


**[Marmello Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_marmello/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 27, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Marmello?

Again, not too much has been written about the group in English, but [relevant kpop wikia link](http://kpop.wikia.com/wiki/MARMELLO). The group is a 5 member female band, who is signed to  Rolling CultureOne. They debuted just a few months ago (in May to be exact) with the single ""[Puppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjIQP56CxU),"" which is currently their only release so far.

**[Eve Remake Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_eve/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 27, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Eve?

Eve is a Gen 1 male Korean rock band that has been active since 1997. They are signed to MCC Entertainment, and currently has 4 members. While there has been various lineup chages since the groups inception, the current lineup has all the original founding members. The group is known for being one of the first Korean bands to use the visual rock/glam concept. The group has most recently released a collab track with Super Juniors Heechul (called ""[Melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8m_Jo44dg)"") and performed on Immortal Songs on the March 11th episode.



**[Rui Solo Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_rui/)**

* Date Project Ends: November 30, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Rui?

Rui is a member of girl group H.U.B., who debuted in February 9, 2017 with the single [Girl Gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs6nHNis8FQ) (though they released a pre-release single in November of the previous year). Rui is Japanese, and she is the rapper and visual in H.U.B. Not too much has been written about both the group and Rui in English, but she had her solo debut in August 2016 with the single [Exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQQULifcnY&amp;pbjreload=10), won Gold in the 60m Track Champion of the Idol Star Athletics Championships (2017 Lunar New Year Special), and was Maxim Koreas cover girl in September 2017.
 

**[015B Remake Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_015b/)**

* Date Project Ends: December 21, 2017
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is 015B?

015B is a Gen 1 duo (formerly a group) signed to MCC Entertainment. Not much as been written about them in English, but they initially debuted in 1990 as an actual band with 4 members. However, the group seems to have disbanded in 1996. In 2006, the group was revived via two of the founding members, and has promoted as a duo under the groups name ever since. Most of their current work features guest vocalists. 

**[14U New Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_14u/)**

* Date Project Ends: January 2, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is 14U?

14U (pronounced One For You) is a 14 member boy group from BG Entertainment. The group is actually made up in two subunits (think EXO K/M), one being 14U-X (the ""masculine charisma"" subunit) and 14U-L (the ""cute friendly charms"" subunit) with 7 members in each subunit - though they are currently promoting as a whole team. The group debuted in July with the song ""[VVV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b83iEHH_UTU),"" but were soon dragged into a controversy when member Doyool was falsely accused of ""dissing"" Kyungsoo of EXO. It was soon revealed that this post was actually from an impersonator account and BG is currently taking legal action against the impersonator.

I also started thinking about how other really iconic songs just get lost to time when it felt like back then they were things that would never be forgotten.  So in this discussion, we wax nostalgic of how these kids today man, they just don't know  

Remember when Teen Top's Rocking was considered one of the craziest songs solely because of that one dance move?

They're here to stay as weekly Saturday threads now, unless for some reason I need to move them to another day again, but this works for me and the mods' schedule for weekly sticky posts, so Saturday's it is. Anyways, the results from last week are in! You can view all the scores (and previous rates) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox). The highest rated song from last week's song (and actually the highest rated song thus far) was **Oh My Girl's Closer!**

Did your butterfly poop a spider? Is your love on fire? Did Chaeyoung knock-knock you out of the ring with her fire rapping skills? Let's see and find out, here are this week's songs! 

1. [BLACKPINK - Playing with Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pdj4iJD08s)
2. [Girls' Generation - Flower Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG1cIlM1juw)*
3. [B.A.P. - Wake Me Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku_FYERiHC8)
4. [MV] [TWICE - One More Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoOEry-Yc4)*
5. [WINNER - Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRj4toENrnA)
6. [Weki Meki -  I Dont Like Your Girlfriend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAsyhiaHzJQ)
7. [EXO-CBX - Rhythm After Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtVDFsTSjn8)

[An asterisk (*) indicates that the song is a Japanese song.]

By now this should be familiar but in case this is your first time participating: each review must come with a score between 1 - 10, inclusive. Leave about an 80-word review and provide some sort of insight into the song and your ranking. Its not a hard rule: if you can be creative, fun, and substantive in less than 80 words, go for it! You don't have to review each song, so feel free to review as many as you want. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, then you can review both the MV and the music itself (but you don't have to review the music video if you don't want to).

**NOTE**: I do not personally pick these songs. With the exception of TWICE's new Japanese song, since I thought it would be fun to include it this week, since it just came out and I wasn't expecting it. The rest of the songs were all randomly picked using a generator. 

If you would still like to submitJapanese songs or ballads, I'll keep taking submissions until I think there are too many. So, I'm still accepting! This will probably be the last week I'm going to take B-side submissions for awhile, so if you have a B-side you want to nominate, get it in now! Wanna submit? Here are the forms: 

*  [submit here for B-side nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYzPfaSTc-qBY-O6u2EMw6ZY7HV_lNC7E9o949cbh0-kVoaw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
*  [submit here for Japanese songs/ballad nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejzq6nbRKFlJZpmA4lMAFE7eOO6YAtib5wT_bTFkKam6gx9A/viewform?usp=sf_link)

[Wiki page with last week's results](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox)

***New Feature:*** I decided since some people might be interested in the cumulative results overall, I'll include a new feature at the end of each Jukebox, sorta like a Top 10 Thread, except this time it's r/kpop's Top 10 Songs (so far) from the Jukebox. The fun thing about this is that it'll change over time (hopefully!). I'm doing this because Oh My Girl's Closer ended up actually having the highest score out of all the Jukebox threads so far! And thus the idea popped in my head. It'l sorta be like r/kpop's iChart: songs will move around as more and more songs get ranked, and you'll end up seeing the Top 10 songs picked by the sub. So, here's the beginning of that chart!

#r/kpop's Top 10 Jukebox Songs 

Rank|Artist - Song|Score
:--|:--|:--|
**1**|**Oh My Girl - Closer**|**8.64**
2|SHINee - Feel Good|8.42

##MUSIC

BtoB have 10 mini-albums, 1 (soon to be 2!) full albums, and several Japanese releases. Since I can't list everything, here are their title tracks from oldest to newest, not including solo songs!

Their earlier releases were mostly dance tracks, and then they had a ballad trilogy which was their breakthrough. The last two releases were again dance tracks, and finally the upcoming album is rumored to be a ballad. All in all, they're capable of doing any kind of music, from funky to angsty. We all know their vocals are great, but in my opinion their hidden strength lies in their ability to seamlessly tie in great rap breaks into their songs rather than making them feel forced and awkward.

###Title Tracks (Korean)

* [Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42A-rFdralM)

###B-Sides

This is an (entirely biased) handful of some of my favorite b-sides to show their musical range!

* [Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyMFZXxtyPE)
* [New Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF5ed57_56Y)
* [Just Say It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ts6plaBFH0)
* [Someday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eba7wPMgb4E)

##SHOWS/MISC.

###Series

BtoB has a TON of shows including: The Beat, BtoB MTV Diary, Beatcom, BtoB Black Box, the list goes on...

Luckily, here's a great [masterlist](http://luxingjae.tumblr.com/post/163175115904/hey-im-new-to-these-btob-stuff-i-saw-them-on) with eng subs!

A note on subs - most older shows can be found subbed via subbing youtube accounts (you can find them in the list above), but these days Cube allows fansubs on their own channel so, for instance, BeatCom videos and later episodes of The Beat are subbed directly on Cube's channel. 

And of course, their vlive also has subs for all the content!

###Variety

Of course this is not everything, just a few of my faves!

* [Knowing Brows](http://kshow123.net/show/knowing-brother/episode-74.html)
* [New Yang Nam Show](http://kshow123.net/show/new-yang-nam-show/episode-3.html)
* [Amigo TV](http://www.vlive.tv/video/22136) - Probably one of my favorite episodes of any variety ever

###Notable Youtube Clips

* [Fun ABC Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Pvvf8o15c)
* [Quiet and Reserved Idols series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQrNw31fHs) - The number 1 way to make anyone a Melody (why didn't I just put this up top?)
* [K-Rush Interview for Movie](https://youtu.be/vXCmyV3eZCc?t=3m38s)
* [The Qmentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTErpcYepvo)
* [High Note Battle with Monsta X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCYLu7BKVw) - headphone warning

###Misc. Fun Facts

honestly idk where to put all this but it needs to be shared

* They were once enthusiastically introduced as Infinite at a year-end show, [look at poor Ilhoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjtC4EYxUlI)
* They were once on [Americas Next Top Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm39j63Ow1Q) to teach the models how to dance to Beep Beep
* Vocal line live together, Minhyuk and Ilhoon live together, and Peniel lives alone
* Here are [Melodies rapping Ilhoon's part](https://twitter.com/changsvbism/status/809534387775639552?s=09) in ""It's Okay"" (I'm not crying)
* Ilhoon once called Sungjae during his vlive stream and Sungjae was actually watching [Blackpink's stream instead](https://twitter.com/changsvbism/status/820515956426321920)
* Peniel absolutely butchered a karaoke performance of [Mamamoo's You're the Best](https://twitter.com/changsvbism/status/881132572708806656) but they all hyped him up anyway (note, they have literally done a [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_WDXQtRUCs) of this song)

##TLDR

Amazing vocalists. Basically a group of 7 comedians. Comeback next week. And if you can, please buy their album, I think were capable of reaching 100k physical sales!!! Happy stanning! [Yejiapsa!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BtfyIrng18)",31,202,False,self,,,,,

When they do, is there a title track that you enjoyed more than the other? What are they? Repackage title tracks included as well. You can add Japanese ones too if you want. Here's just some for me

2017:

* DIA - Will You Go Out With Me &gt; Can't Stop

* Dreamcatcher - Good Night &gt; Fly High, Chase Me

* 9MUSES - Remember &gt; Love City. Both are great, but the entire vibe of Remember was so different and darker.

* TWICE - Knock Knock &gt; Signal. I still haven't eased up to Signal. Knock Knock takes it for me 100%.

2016: 

* Brave Girls - Deepened &gt; High Heels. Deepened was that song. And then their entire image and sound changed with the High Heels comeback, which although wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't what I like.

* LADIES' CODE - Galaxy &gt; The Rain

* GOT7 - Fly &gt; Hard Carry

* Dalshabet - Someone Like U &gt; FRI.SAT.SUN. I was surprised Dalshabet made 2 comebacks this year. The retro greatness of Someone Like U is so amazing. I hardly replay the other at all. 

2015:

* 9MUSES - Hurt Locker &gt; Drama, Sleepless Nights

2014:

* SISTAR - I Swear &gt; Touch My Body. Any day.

* Apink - Mr. Chu &gt; LUV

* Girl's Day - Something &gt; Darling. They're both so different from each other lol.

2012:

* SISTAR - Loving U &gt; Alone. While I love dark Sistar and all, Loving U just trumps all of that for me. 

2011:

* f(x) - Hot Summer &gt; Pinocchio (Danger)

* T-ARA - Roly-Poly &gt; Cry Cry

2010: 

* SISTAR - How Dare You &gt; Shady Girl, Push Push

* SNSD - Hoot &gt; Oh!, Run Devil Run

* 2PM - Without U &gt; I'll Be Back

2009:

* 2PM - Again &amp; Again &gt; Heartbeat. I have both downloaded, but I hardly replay Heartbeat at all.

Some that I couldn't bring myself to choose were 2011 MBLAQ and Gee or Genie.",93,81,False,self,,,,,

Some banger songs have gotten terrible or plain boring MVs (Super Junior's Sorry Sorry anyone?) so I was wondering what music videos you guys would direct for your favourite title track if given the chance. 

Personally, I want to change Wanna One's Burn it Up MV with a passion - the song's lyrics are a cool way to introduce a group yet the music video looks like it was filmed by a college film student on a budget. Instead, I would love for some kind of story to the video - maybe short story montages of how the group met and formed Wanna One. I remember the director being someone who worked on a lot of films as well, so I was expecting more of a narrative.

I'm a sucker for story/thematic MVs in general to I just want more groups to do grand narratives like T-ara's Day by Day or Nu'est's Overcome. 

Edit: I also would like SHINee's Sherlock to have a legit and interesting murder plot. The one in the MV was so sloppy and lacked any effort on SM's part.",67,70,False,self,,,,,

It's time to find out about who exactly you guys are.  When we posted the census last year, we were at nearly 60,000 subscribers.  Now, thanks to some Reddit sajaegi we have **quadrupled in size!**  This year there are no fill-in-the-blank options, but there should be enough categories to fit everyone demographically.  If your country is listed, select that.  If it's not, select your continent.  We will also be selecting our five favorite groups and five favorite soloists.  Each list has over 300 choices, so if your favorites aren't listed, we're sorry, you'll just have to pick someone else.  They are listed alphabetically and you can **use ctrl-f to search** for your faves.  Remember **soloists are on a separate question.**  You can select a maximum of five on each list, but you may also select fewer or none if you wish.  Of course, we like to torture you, so good luck only picking five.  So without further ado:

The census is super short, and will it only take you about 5 minutes to fill out, tops.  The form will be open for submissions for three weeks and will **close on October 30th.**  You will need to login to fill out the form, but we are **not** collecting email addresses.  Forcing login is the only way to prevent duplicate submissions.  If you notice anything wrong with the form or gross errors on our part, please let us know in the comments so we can correct it.

I've loved Only One ever since I heard it and have always considered it as one of my favourite songs but I just get way to happy singing Five. The song is so bubbly to me and I just enjoy it so much that it's became my new favourite song from Apink. 

GFriend - Navillera and Summer Rain
I definitely prefer Summer Rain, the choreography is just so beautiful and the song is a catch as well. 

Hello Venus - Would You Stay For Some Tea and Mysterious
WYSFST is what I always thought kpop was when I first started listening to kpop. It's just so catchy and I love the chorus. Mysterious was a bit of a let down for me. 

Mamamoo - Decalcomanie and Yes I Am
Decalcomanie is still my favourite Mamamoo song, it's just too good of a beat that I can't resist singing along too. ",52,29,False,self,,,,,

* This is the eighth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! 
**Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Nugus**!

* Nugus are groups that are not popular both in Korea and internationally. (no groups from the big 3 obviously)
* Any song by a Nugu group.
* They can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [Boys Republic - Get Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIiZ_jHlzS8)
* [ToppDogg - The Beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urmX0l5aBs8)
* [HALO - Mariya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-gAo2Axl4w)

Nugu playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdulpPyEyKuunwW_HHs44IbL)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

The goal of this series is to give an avenue for the numbers nerds (and others interested) out there to have a place to discuss sales, charts, or any other type of number that they find interesting. 

This series is not meant to replace any of the sales or achievement threads that are currently allowed in the subreddit.  It is intended as a supplement for the numbers that otherwise wouldnt be available for discussion.

We will be focusing primarily on Hanteo and Oricon in the main post.  There are many other places that numbers can come from (Gaon, Billboard, digital sales, etc).  Please feel free to comment numbers that are interesting to you on this post.  :)

Our current plan for posts is every other week on Tuesday/Wednesday (depending on schedule), then we may need to cut back to a monthly thread as timing and scheduling allows.

Special thanks to the team, /u/ArysOakheart and /u/nomoreiloveyous.  Couldnt do it without you.  &lt;3

**Fun Stuff**: Numbers!

This is going to be long because I'm catching us up for the year.  Future editions won't be quite this long.  If I missed someone, I'm sorry!  Feel free to add them in the comments below.  (Just Hanteo for the moment).  Sources: Since I can't read Korean, nor have a Korean credit card, I'm relying on secondary sources for these.  Thanks to OneHallyu and their sources from weibo / baidu bar:  @ Weibo (formerly MJ) || jjlin11 @  || qingshengcheng and  @ .

Remember, Hanteo only counts **physical sales**.

The handicaps were charming as hell, but it would  be really nice to watch a more-or-less reasonably balanced fight as well.

Which idols (male or female) would you put in your E-sports Dream Team?

For Overwatch we can't not have Hongbin from VIXX!

Edit :

So far we have

League of Legends
Jungkook
V
Kyuhyun
Heechul
Yura

Overwatch
Hongbin - Hanzo
Hyemi - Mercy
Keumjo - Pharah
Hyejeong - D.Va

I don't know which game to put others in! And if you know their roles/mains that would be great too HAHA I'm gonna binge watch idols playing esports after I get some things done!

You saw it with Super Junior M and EXO-M. My question is, does anyone actually really enjoy their favorites' Chinese discography? Are there any songs you would recommend to other K-pop fans? Which group do you wish would release more in Chinese? I'm talking only K-pop artists releasing music in Chinese. 

Personally, I really liked what EXO-M had to offer at their debut. C-pop tends to be ballad-focused, so I still jam to a lot of EXO-M's more upbeat tracks, like [Black Pearl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di2kFu8dTmk) from EXO's debut mini.",31,17,False,self,,,,,

Another misconception I've seen from non-fans is that Jeongyeon is the best singer in Twice, which I also find funny because even Onces have yet to hear Jeongyeon sing something longer than maybe 30s outside of Sixteen. Jeongyeon is probably the 3rd best in Twice, she has natural power and projection but she lacks the stability and control that Jihyo and Nayeon have so Jeongyeon can get [kind of shouty or shaky](https://youtu.be/qcnb9qx9vBw?t=58s).

Let me know if there's any mistakes in the post. 

To keep up with the show, here's a [timeline](https://mobile.twitter.com/sujusnaps/status/917208859420315649) posted last thread. Basically, 2 episodes ~5-7 minutes long at 11 am KST Mon-Fri for 6 weeks till Nov. 17, released on V Live. I recommend following their V Live channel as they're subbed in English the moment they're uploaded. 

Do you guys prefer the end of the week posts over posting them when they come out?",11,35,False,self,,,,,

Not just the typical oh I love how bonded fans are(said no one ever) or I hate Sara ang fans(don't we all). 

Like - I love the dedication of sub teams, fan chant teams and going out of their way to have banners for birthdays, etc. 

Dislike - What I hate is absolute delusion, and the fact that many fans seem to think that they understand and know their idols personally, or extrapolate relationships like 'oh Taeyeon smiled at Jessica, they must be so close' when the fact is that they are professionals. We will NEVER know how idols are truly off camera unless you know them personally, as a performer myself, stage persona differs greatly from reality as you're doing it FOR your audience. But I've been told this is the goal of Kpop, to build a false sense of 'closeness' and 'protectiveness' over your idol. That's what keeps fans around.

It was really fun to read all your reviews. Last week was a week of CAP LOCKS group names: SNSD, TWICE, WEME, WINNER, B.A.P. and more were all on the jukebox! You can view all the scores (and previous rates) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_full_rankings). Just a fun observation, but Weki Meki's ""I Don't Like Your Girlfriend"" was the girl group song that's had the most comments since [the very first thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=kpop) with GFriend and Red Velvet - there were a LOT of opinions on this song. It was actually extremely close in terms of the highest rated song from last weeks jukebox. **BLACKPINKs Playing With Fire** had the highest rating from last week with a score of 8.21, but was closely followed by __EXO-CBXs Rhythm After Summer__ with a score of 8.20. Talk about cutting it close, its just a hundredth of a difference! (NOW BURN BABY BURN)

Hey

I know its been awhile

I dont think... 

Ive got the girls out

**WOO!**

Yeah, you feel that? It feels good, doesnt it. Is it true? Is it trueeee? Were gonna break some hearts tonight, were gonna make some noise tonight! Get crazy! Here are this weeks songs:

1. [KARA - Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2EQm6WPMHs)
2. [Girls Generation - Girls Are Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAHQAuq6dC8) 
3. [MV] [GOT7 - You Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktc8XDBq93k)
4. [BTS - Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfKYWOUlq1o) ([Prologue Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2mVpfEviJo))^1
5. [Eddy Kim - The Manual ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4mH2KvzUQ0)
6. [Cosmic Girls - Miracle (  )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsGnmbd7kqA)
7. [Girls Generation - Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H07AEmyYwS4)

~~so close to having all of WonSoKa ahhhhh~~

You know what to do! But in case you dont: each review must come with a score between 1-10, inclusive, left as a reply to the comment with the song title. Leave about an 80-word review and provide some sort of insight on your thoughts and opinions on the song/ranking. This is not a hard rule: if you can be creative, fun, and substantive in less than 80 words, go for it! You dont have to review each song, so feel free to review as many as you want! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, then you can review both the MV and the music video itself (but you dont have to review the music video if you dont want to and just talk about the music instead). 

Just as a reminder:  While I picked two of the songs this week^2, **all five other songs were randomly chosen!** I did not pick the rest of these songs, they were all randomly generated (and if you would like a more detailed explanation of how thats done, and how scheduling works, you can read more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6zl99w/rkpop_jukebox_threads_introduction_scheduling/)).

***
1. I included the Prologue Version of the BTS song because I think its significantly different enough (it doesnt contain any of the rap verses) that it can help you determine the ranking for the song, by listening both with the rap and without the rap (and see which one you prefer). For the purposes of this thread, only the original version of Butterfly is going to be ranked, but I thought it would be pertinent to the discussion to include the Prologue version. 
 
2. In light of the recent news of Sooyoung, Tiffany, and Seohyun choosing to leave SM, and the future of SNSD highly unclear until someone releases a statement, I thought it would be appropriate (at least for this week) to include two songs emblematic of the situation (Girls Are Back and Goodbye). All the other songs were randomly chosen. **Yes, I am aware they did NOT disband** and are trying to work things out; that said, for a lot of people it feels like the end of an era even if theyre not disbanded. Regardless of what happens we are saying Goodbye to older, simpler times with SNSD and as such the song is picked because 1) Sooyoung, Seohyun, and Tiffany are saying Goodbye to SM and 2) its Goodbye to an era of SNSD group comebacks for what will probably be awhile.

Just so its fair, for the next two weeks jukeboxes (unless SNSD is randomly picked for Artist Spotlight next week), any SNSD song that is randomly picked will be omitted, as I picked two SNSD songs (as opposed to one since were on Week 2 and I get to pick a song this week) when Im normally not supposed to.

If youre wondering what the omitted song was: it was the K-Pop Button Song and it was LOO/Kim Lip - Eclipse. Because I want to be fair, since K-Pop Button is used every week, *next weeks Jukebox will include Eclipse as one of the seven songs.* (just in case you wanted to listen ahead of next week or get your ~~wigs~~ reviews ready haha)

 ^Every ^week ^ ^Last: ^2017-10-14

It looks like Oh My Girls Closer is going to be the top song for another week haha, maybe for awhile, but for good reason! [It was very well-liked when rated in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/731i5h/jukebox_3_living_close_and_dope_and_free_somebody/dnmueqd/), and its a very good song. I personally think its one of the best Oh My Girl songs (and I say this as someone whos not a fan but has listened to their discography). Itll be interesting to see how this chart looks next week. 

[Full Top Ten Chart Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_the_jukebox_chart_-_the_top_10_songs)

Massive thank you to everyone who submitted B-sides, Japanese songs, and ballads! Ive gotten over 150 different Japanese songs and ballads now - thank you to the people who submitted and (because I can see that in some cases people submitted over thirty songs) thank you for putting up with the formatting of the Google form. Im really sorry it wasnt easier to submit multiple songs in one go, but that was the only way to do it in a way that I could get every single song individually on a list. Really appreciate your contributions! As of this time, Im no longer taking submissions for ballads and Japanese songs since there are more than enough.

I did say that last week I was going to stop taking B-side submissions: I lied, sorry. I still want some more! I want the same number of songs as I have for ballads/Japanese releases. So yes, Im still taking submissions. For the sake of having a more representative sampling, **please do not submit any more SHINee B-sides.** SHINee and Taemin are the artists who have the most songs submitted for them! I mean, I cant really stop you from submitting more, but [I would really encourage and suggest that you submit other ones!](https://fat.gfycat.com/ShadyPoliteBushsqueaker.gif) 

** [submit here for B-side nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYzPfaSTc-qBY-O6u2EMw6ZY7HV_lNC7E9o949cbh0-kVoaw/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

Also, next week Ill probably reveal the results of that fun little extra question at the end of the B-side survey too hehe.

Alright, thats it for now! LaLaLaLaLaLa, 1,2,3,4,5,6 do it! Have fun reviewing and thanks for participating!

One song per member.

No solos.

You can do multiple groups if you like :)

Monsta X -

* Shownu - He really shined during White Love but his [first lines](https://youtu.be/KA-ccrefICc?t=45) are my favorite.
* Wonho - [EVERY DAY EVERY NIGHT I CAN FEEL YOU OHHH](https://youtu.be/f5Zedh_5DDM?t=45).
* Minhyuk - 1/2 of team no-lines. My favorite would be in [Amen](https://youtu.be/tpMVdaYQ1hs?t=99). I found his ""bwa"" and ""da"" parts so cute lol.
* Kihyun - This [note](https://youtu.be/InTQK7LWjxQ?t=164) in Unfair Love.  
* Hyungwon - The other half of team no-lines. He owned the chorus in [Interstellar](https://youtu.be/dBUWcM2TBpM?t=38). 
* Jooheon - Now this was extremely hard for me since he's my boi and his parts are usually my favorite in every MX song. But if I had to choose one, then it would be his verse from my favorite MX song, [Stuck](https://youtu.be/ro74Ki2jsNg?t=108).
* I.M. - Another hard one because his deep raps kill me. I'll go with his [iconic english](https://youtu.be/iewWMqeMpqU?t=24) in Shine Forever.

BigBang - 

* TOP - His entire rap in [Bae Bae](https://youtu.be/TKD03uPVD-Q?t=59).
* GD - [WE GO HARD](https://youtu.be/2ips2mM7Zqw?t=102)
* Taeyang - When Loser slows down and [his voice comes in](https://youtu.be/1CTced9CMMk?t=150). If you're not crying, you will now.
* Daesung - His smooth af [vocals](https://youtu.be/iIPH8LFYFRk?t=120) in FXXK IT.
* Seungri - His [first verse](https://youtu.be/--zku6TB5NY?t=30) in Last Dance. So heavenly.

### + BASICS
**NAME:** AOA (); stands for ""Ace of Angels"" after the angel concept they debuted with

**FANDOM NAME:** ELVIS, after their debut song

**DEBUT:** August 9, 2012 under FNC Entertainment

**MEMBERS:** (2012-2016) 7+1, (2016) 7, (2017) 6

**SUBUNIT(S):** AOA Black, AOA White, AOA Cream

**LABELMATES:** FTISLAND, C.N.BLUE, HONEYST, N.FLYING, SF9

### + SUBUNIT EXPLANATION

Story time, folks! AOA is a concept group. When they first debuted, their concept was ""angels"". You see this motif throughout their entire discography--their first single album was ""Angels' Story"", their first Japanese album ""Ace of Angels"", and their first Korean album ""Angel's Knock"". So they had this ridiculous backstory and everything to go with the whole theme, including *angel names* if you can believe it (AOA used to be embarrassed about the angel concept, but now they like it because angels are ""pure""). The story is that AOA are angels from the heavens that came to Earth(CTRL+F to the ELVIS M/V | the [AOA reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AceOfAngels8/) has more information). When I said that AOA used to be a 7+1 group, I mean that AOA is itself seven members, plus Youkyung, who is a half-angel half-human (because she's only part of AOA Black). 

AOA's company, FNC Entertainment, had only previously debuted bands CNBLUE and FTISLAND. They had never had a girl group before, so for their first one, they wanted a dual band-dance team. Hence why AOA is broken up into **AOA Black** and **AOA White** (I suspect this is further building off that angels theme). **AOA Black** is the band unit of AOA, consisting of **Choa, Yuna, Youkyung, Mina, and Jimin.** **AOA White** is the dance unit of AOA, consisting of lead dancers **Chanmi, Seolhyun, and Hyejeong.**

These subunits can get confusing because... they're not really subunits. Not in the way that subunits like Trouble Maker and Girls' Generation-TTS are. These subunits are primarly just for the company to divide up AOA's talents of expertise. AOA Black has released music under the label of AOA--AOA White hasn't released any music because they are a performance group. 

AOA Black - [MOYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1vE2mxtCIg), [Without You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6LC6FzUSz8), [ELVIS (Band Ver.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Cq5m_uu0M), [Get Out (Band Ver.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bz6ZRmtrb0)

AOA White - [Performance#1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBTExCBv3uc), [Performance#2 + Yuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnbMUWZHjuo)

Actually, a better explanation is that of EXO-K and EXO-M. The idea is that both of these subunits were supposed to promote individually and together at different points, but after the first two years of AOA Black not doing well and AOA's 2013 Red Motion being well-received, FNC decided to scrap the two separate sub-units idea and promote as OT7 AOA.

**AOA Cream** debuted in early 2016, with members **Hyejeong, Yuna, and Chanmi.** The idea was to let the underrated members of AOA shine. They released their first single [I'm Jelly Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaxUPPdXkaI) on February 11, 2016. It's a fun, poppy, Sailor Moon-esque glittery mess.

**BORN:** March 6, 1990

**ANGEL NAME:** Choaya

**MEMBER OF:** AOA/AOA Black

**[INSTAGRAM](http://instagram.com/queenchoa_)**

**KNOWN FOR**

 * She leads most of AOA's songs. AOA is pretty notorious for having horrible line distributions, and at any given point Choa gets 60% of the song, though the distributions are getting better. 
 * Very kind and mature. She gives off a graceful, womanly image. Mothers the other members a lot, though who can blame her; the age difference between her and the maknae is six years!
 * [Her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0oRFCpDsBo) [beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJab0-v063A) [range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TLPBTwsTFs)

 * In AOA Black, she plays the guitar
 * She's dreamed of being a singer since she was a kid
 * Her parents disapproved of her dreams; when she was in high school, she would practicing singing alone at night
 * She eventually enrolled in Inha Technical College to study Aviation Business Administration at her father's request, but she continued to secretly audition to become a singer without telling her parents
 * She failed the SM Entertainment audition 15 times but she kept trying
 * She got her lucky break when FNC Entertainment's Juniel found her and directed her to FNC Entertainment's auditions for their girl group AOA

**WHY I LOVE HER**

 * She's very hard-working yet incredibly insecure. She has expressed issues with her body and age in the past, and struggled alone with depression and insomnia for years before leaving AOA
 * Her voice is so incredibly unique. Whenever I hear it, I always find myself wanting more of it. My favorite utilization of her vocals has to be from their b-side [Tears Falling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u50CzC0u6c)

**FACTS**

 * In AOA Black, she plays the guitar (harmonica and piano are just a welcome addition to her growing roster of talents YEET)

 * She has a guitar named Mimi that her mother gave her
 * She's a big fan of Jay Park
 * She trained the longest out of everyone in AOA (four years)

**WHY I LOVE HER**

 * I really like her [rapping style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9MYkY0D6oY). I think it's unique and while it can be unsuited for some songs, in others it adds a lot of character.
 * I think her relationship with the maknae, Chanmi, is very cute; they very much [spoil each other with love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBkrF81It-I)
 * This may sound odd, but I also appreciate her efforts to branch out as a solo artist and establish her own voice

**FACTS**

**ANGEL NAME:** Minaring

**MEMBER OF:** AOA/AOA Black

**[INSTAGRAM](https://instagram.com/kvwowv)**

**KNOWN FOR**

 * She's really cute. Almost too cute for AOA's sexy concept. It's a long-running fandom joke that Mina [never looks quite right when she has to pose sexy.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6d/bd/28/6dbd28305447c1ed090ec497b9c62bc6.gif)

**FACTS**

* In AOA Black, she plays the bass
* Her family was actually really supportive of her dream to be an idol. They moved from Busan to Seoul in order to help fulfill her dream!
* She used to be a famous ulzzang
* She's apparently the lead rapper but I wasn't aware until about two seconds ago because she stopped rapping after AOA's second comeback (hence why her vocals took a few years to develop)
* She loves eating the most in AOA (her favorites are chicken and pizza)
* For reasons that will never be clarified, she is in charge of laundry in AOA's dorm

**WHY I LOVE HER**
 
* Like her bestie, Dong Dong, she's also an [idiot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKxbtD5LJhs). An adorable idiot.
* I actually really like her voice. It's not as strong live because she only just recently became a vocalist, but she's deeply improved in the last few comebacks. I personally adore her mature, elegant deeper voice... especially in songs like [Excuse Me](https://youtu.be/NRlDo3JuzfI?t=3m8s), [Bing Bing](https://youtu.be/dfMELZBBVRY?t=37s), and [Oh Boy](https://youtu.be/oSaULYBGsfM?t=1m50s)

**BORN:** March 15, 1993

**ANGEL NAME:** Y (for Y IS SHE HALF HUMAN ha ahahahaha)

**MEMBER OF:** AOA Black

**[INSTAGRAM](https://instagram.com/drrrr.youkyung)**

**KNOWN FOR**

 * Prior to leaving AOA in December 2016, she'd been locked up in FNC's dungeon for *years*
 * Honestly if you just recently got into AOA, you'd probably have never heard of her
 * She's only part of AOA's band unit, so she isn't officially an idol
 * Her drumming [rocks though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u9eZjxeA6M)
 * For the really hardcore indie Korean music fans, they might recognize her as being the former drummer of small-time band [Sponge Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbOj8qY9p_A)

**FACTS**

* She's played the drums since seventh grade
* She's a fan of Super Junior's Heechul
* Rock band N.EX.T's Kim Sehwang gave her music lessons
* She says she thinks she's a very tough person
* Not that much is known about her because she's a very out-of-the-spotlight kind of gal

**WHY I LOVE HER**

* I have a lot of admiration for people who endure and overcome hardship. Despite getting nothing from FNC Entertainment, Youkyung never lashed out or did anything to hurt AOA. I'm sorry she didn't get a bigger chance while still part of AOA Black.
* She seems very genuinely sweet and she gets along with the AOA members really well (if you watch their reality series *Open Up! AOA* you get to see Youkyung out of the dungeon)
* So no drama over being ignored once AOA become an idol group hehe
* She's actually a really cool [vocalist and rapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMThTL8uvs8)... which made her eventual departure from AOA all the more frustrating

**ANGEL NAME:** Seolhyunari

**MEMBER OF:** AOA/AOA White

**[INSTAGRAM](https://instagram.com/sh_9513)**

 * Probably the most universally-recognized member of AOA. She stars in movies, dramas, advertisements, commercials; if you can name it, she's blessed it with her face. 
 * Constantly ranked as one of the top visuals of the new generation.
 * She dated Zico of Block B for a bit, but they broke up in 2016... Seolhyun got a lot of hate for it.
 * In general just being [all](http://49.media.tumblr.com/e1b936191cf195244bbd9cd46b726e81/tumblr_nto6ggK7xb1tewz89o1_500.gif) [around](http://31.media.tumblr.com/3ef14cada333727d185674333ccaa4ce/tumblr_ntkk5isqwB1scs1sjo6_400.gif) [gorgeous](https://media.giphy.com/media/XzdrlBebaW3Ly/giphy.gif), oh my god
 * Another fake maknae (at this point the ages mean nothing lol)

**FACTS**

 * She's part of AOA White and is a [great dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUSvSGhFofQ)
 * She wanted to become a singer when she was in school, and it was actually her school band that taught her how to dance? FNC Entertainment chooses interesting people.
 * She's played piano since she was a child
 * She went to an arts-focused high school
 * Her dream is for AOA to become the most influential idol group (which is. so sad. hold me for a second real quick)
 * She was bullied when she was younger for her dark skin (but look at her now, making millions off her looks. karma plays nice sometimes)

**WHY I LOVE HER**

* She joined AOA to become a singer, but now she's a lead dancer and money-making actress to boot. At the start, her vocals were very weak live, but now you can see in recent songs that [her voice has really improved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnbki56mSZw)
* I really admire her love and dedication to AOA. She could easily leave at any point and still do fine, but [she really wants AOA to succeed in the industry.](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/05/seolhyun-thought-aoa-might-be-better-off-without-her-at-one-point)
* This is just a personal thing for me, but when AOA got their first win with Seolhyun for Like a Cat, Seolhyun started crying and babbling [""Mom, I won first place""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t05qL7JaU4E)and any girl whose first thought is their mother when they've just accomplished something they've dreamed of for years is a winner in my book

### [Chanmi](http://i.imgur.com/nyJE7d9.jpg) (MAIN DANCER, LEAD RAPPER, VOCALIST, MAKNAE)

**BORN:** June 19, 1996

**ANGEL NAME:** Chanmi T.T (FNC really killing it here)

**MEMBER OF:** AOA/AOA White

**[INSTAGRAM](https://instagram.com/chanmi_96a/)**

**KNOWN FOR**

 * An incredibly talented dancer ([CHANMI SOLO DANCE - LOOK AT MI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVNR8c4SY-0)). She's the thickest out of AOA, so she has a lot of power and grace in her movements. All of AOA agrees that she's the best and they envy her skills.
 * She's weirdly young for a maknae, especially in terms of her group. She was fourteen when she debuted.
 * As per most maknaes, pretty mischievous, loves screwing around with people (particularly [Choa](https://youtu.be/Dfw5nhuc4VQ?t=9m45s) and Yuna)
 * Everyone babies her because she's been with them since she was so young

**FACTS**

* She's a part of AOA White
* She's AOA Cream's rapper
* She [ran away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4E5VyZNtB4) during Miniskirt promotions once because she was scared (#lookhere if you're going to look at anything from this post, look at this video) and Jimin and their manager had to come and find her and bring her back
* Her role model is Boa
* She used to share a bunk bed with Choa, who absolutely hated it because all of Chanmi's stuff would fall into her bad (evil maknae strikes even in her sleep)
* She was super hyper as a child so her mom signed her up for dance lessons, leading her to where she is today

**WHY I LOVE HER**

* She's very cheerful and forward. I admire her straightforwardness and cool way of speaking. 
* Her body shape isn't the ideal idol type and she's not very popular, but I have yet to see any signs of Chanmi taking it to heart or stopping her hard work as a result.

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Anything else is fair game, no matter how trivial or silly.  Remember, you can ask your K-pop questions any day of the week over at r/kpophelp.

1076,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-10-16,2017,10,16,20,76py62,self.kpop,[171014] Taemin's Off-Sick Days 1 and 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/76py62/171014_taemins_offsick_days_1_and_2/,jolaurence,1508154684,"Alternative title: Taemins first solo concert, but the encore of it.

Originally, I was not going to go to Taemins solo concert. I had already missed the concerts that happened in August for various reasons (mainly money and NCT Dream having promotions) and when the Encore tickets went on sale, I was busy that day. However, the Shawol fairy herself /u/l-autrichienne contacted me on Monday (bless her really) and asking if I had tickets. I told her no and then everything spiraled into me getting a ticket for Sunday night. Then on Friday I ended up getting a ticket for Saturday night as well. A weekend with Taemin here I came. This was also my first official just SHINee related event of the year. Compared to last year, this year has been very SHINee-free for me.

Since I really didnt need merch, I took the few stops to the venue Saturday around 2 pm and got my lightsticks and then headed to the Coex for a big meal and to wander around before heading back. I got my ticket and headed into the venue. For Saturday I was on the third floor. Around 6 pm when the concert was about to start, I turned around and saw that a group of males just came in wearing masks. Yup. Trainees were behind me. How I could tell: they were watching the concert sitting down and intently to learn and study. Also, Shawols are mainly female. Yet, Taemin does have a lot of fanboys.

Note: most of the fan account is going to be blurring both nights because I honestly cant even remember anymore even though it was just the other day. When you see Taemin perform, its like your mind goes somewhere else and youre just transfixed on him and him alone.

The concert both nights in general went like this:
*
Taemin does something.*

Shawols: SCREAM

*Taemin drinks water.*

Shawols: SCREAM

*Taemin teases Shawols by taking off his jacket a little bit and showing his arms.*

Shawols: SCREAM but even loud.

*Taemin reveals he is shirtless under a leather jacket.*

Shawols: dfskjbfsjkbhdfkjhbgdfjkhgkfdsjhfsjd SCREAM
*
Taemin takes off jacket and then runs away.*

Shawols: Scream because hes being a snot.

This was the set list for both nights:

* Rise [new song]
* Drip Drop
* Guess Who
* Sexuality
* Thirsty
* Mystery Lover
* Maze [new song]
* Do It Baby [Korean version]
* Flame of Love [Korean version]
* Press Your Number
* One by One
* Ace
* Play Me
* Crazy for You [new song]
* Back to You  [new song]
* Im Crying [Korean version]
* Romeo + Juliette
* Soldier
* Wicked
* Pretty Boy
* Tiger [Korean version]
* Danger
* Door [Korean version]

Encore:
* Move
* Goodbye
* Love [new song]
* Hypnosis

Rise is so good. Even though it was mainly a VCR and then him singing part of it, it was just so good. I had actual goosebumps. And then Drip Drop began and we got loud. In general, the fan chants were loud. But when it got to Pretty Boy and Tigerit became a rock concert. It was so loud. Whenever it was time for Taemin to do his ments, we would just scream and then were silent until he asked us a question. You could hear a pin drop it was so quiet. All of the new songs he performed were incredible. But I just love, and I mean love, Back to You. Its my favorite from the new album.

For the first night, we held our banners during Romeo + Juliette. We also sang Soldier as the encore song as we waited for Taemin to come back on stage [including ad libs]. For the second night we held them during Solider and then sang Goodbye as the encore song. However, we started shouting Lee Taemin in the middle of the song before starting it up again.

In general, Taemins artistry is just incredible. On Saturday, I looked back and I saw that the trainees were intently watching Taemins every move. Plus, Taemin just kept going and going with this performances. His ments were short which meant we got more songs. Even though he was literally glistening with sweat, he kept going. His vocals have just gotten better since he debuted in 2008. [chants SMs Ace! SMs Ace over and over again]

I left both nights beaming with pride because Taemin was just so good. I was just so proud of him headlining his own concert.
**
Okay, so who was at the concert?**

Saturdays special guests were SNSD and Jonghyuns song girl friend, Taeyeon, NCTs Ten, Renjun, Jeno, Jisung, and Chenle (??? over one of them still since it was hard to see from the few fan pictures), family members, and of course Mr. Fan Club President himself, Jonghyun. They were on the second floor. During the Encore, Taemin pointed out that he was there. Jonghyun was in full fanboy mode and was screaming. Taemin asked the fans to be quiet so Jonghyun could yell what he thought about the concert. Shawols instantly became silent to hear Jonghyun. After Jonghyun yelled we all started to laugh and scream.

Sunday had Shawolteens very own Hoshi and the rest of his Shawolteen crew there [Jeonghan, Jun, Minggyu and Seungkwan], idols who will be part of The Unit [including Hansol], Rain, and of course Shawol President, Minho. He stayed for pretty much the entire concert. On Sunday, I was sitting on the second floor and he was in the section next to me. He was sitting down for the concert to not really attract attention to himself [hes a giant], but his banner was on his cap, like Jonghyun did the day before.

Overall, 10/10. So wonderful. So perfect. Lee Taemin, I swear.",1,49,False,self,,,,,

I listen to Ah-Choo, Candy Jelly Love, Destiny, WOW and Hi consistently. While the other groups in my flare have some of my favorite songs of all time, I really like the B-Side songs or I love the individual girls, consistently my kpop playlist only contains 2 Mamamoo, 2 BlackPink, 2 Gfriend, 2 Twice and 3 Red Velvet ""a-sides"". SNSD ***barely edges them out*** with 6 ""a-side songs"" that I consistently listen to, which considering how deeply I connect with them, was shocking for me to realize (and 2 of those are Japanese releases).

In spite of this, I currently don't know any of the Lovelyz girls' names other than Kei and don't really feel the need to ""delve deeper"" into their discography. I'm clearly a Lovelyz fan judging by my listening habits, but I don't follow any of the girls more than idly. I obviously like their work and they strike me as lovely hard working girls, but I can't even remember the fan name for Lovelyz right now (if I ever knew it).
EDIT: its LOVELINUS!!

Is it just me? Which groups do you like their output but don't ""click with"" enough to fully become a deeper fan? Is there a group whose songs connect with you but you havent moved to look deeper into the group?",97,56,False,self,,,,,

Personally, I will be watching both The Unit and MIXNINE, but I am way more excited for MIXNINE. 


One of the biggest reasons is I love the idea of no-name trainees gaining recognition and becoming super popular like on Produce 101. Another reason is that MIXNINE will be a lot more competitive with guys vs. girls since only the guy or girl group debuts so I feel like the fanbase for the final group will be a lot more loyal since there will probably be fan wars. In other words, there's more of a sense of loyalty since you are having to choose between the two groups while The Unit is just debuting both.

* [Really Really - Ahn Jung Jae](https://youtu.be/plOC07MqhnQ): I've been repeating this for the longest time since I heard it, and it sounds amazing live! I first heard it on [I Can See Your Voice](https://youtu.be/U3gZKEtid6Y) and Seungyoon also shared it on [his instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVpsQoXB8WG/) but the full ver is much more satisfying! Hope he releases a studio version too.
* [Through The Night - Yong Jun Hyung](https://youtu.be/Oz1McxXAkWw): It's a short cover, but damn did he deliver! I love hearing Junhyung's singing voice, and it's cute how he's into soft songs like this haha! Yoo Hee Yeol was kinda worried about the cover at the start of the video, but he did it well in the end.
* [Shape Of You - Gray](https://youtu.be/tiffEf5p6so): Excellent cover! I liked his cover a bit more than Day6 but both did a good job with this song.
* [Call Me Baby - EXO](https://youtu.be/imH-NCfpFiM): Kai starts the song cleanly and the rest was history.
* [Come Back Home - Lee Hi](https://youtu.be/z4B4hosdS8Q): This girl needs to be onstage more. She owned this cover!
* [Love Me Love Me / Island - Winner](https://youtu.be/l0w7p7jS-Ks): Island and LMLM sounds so chill toned down like this and it makes me want to have a glamping on a rooftop and sing Winner songs all night.
* [Bad Boy - Day6](https://youtu.be/F7qYPgGdbsQ): I know it's cheating.. but it's just a few days behind 2017, and their English acoustic ver deserves more views!
* [Koko Bop - Gummy](https://youtu.be/JhoUAbrOaxk): I love how she's having fun while singing this. It's such a bop and this reggae-acoustic version needs to be done by EXO themselves in the future!
* [Like A Star - Dean](https://youtu.be/sVSvFA9jR00): Such a sweet and simple cover from the one and only Dean. It's like candy for your ears!
* [Nobody - Winner](https://youtu.be/_14DVw3uVks): I love it when groups bring back bops and add their own flair to it.

-------

For sure there are performances that I missed and didn't make it in this list.. so hope you guys share your own fave acoustic kpop covers/versions this 2017!

* This is the ninth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! 
**Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Solo Artists**!

* Songs by current idols, ex-idols, or non-idols.
* Songs that are official releases. So no mixtapes. 
* If the song was included in the group album, it doesn't count.
* Any style. Any language (as long as they are not of an already existing song).
* They can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [Taeyang - Ringa Linga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJfZ69MSlvY)
* [Zico - She's A Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMcd43q9nEI)
* [Taeyeon - Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cItgY2UShDA)

Soloist playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdtP5-T-UZjUcGApSGnwjqNF)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

She's worked with SNSD, NCT, Seventeen, Psy etc. 

Relevant parts:

&gt;According to Seo, local TV stations are at the center of major problems, as K-pop agencies and their artists do not make much money from being featured on TV shows. 

&gt;Its a vicious cycle. K-pop artists and people working with them such as stylists and managers are usually lowly paid, as K-pop agencies, including Girls Generations agency S.M. Entertainment, dont get paid much from working with TV stations, Seo said. 

&gt;Seo revealed that stylists earn almost nothing after the money goes to artists first. Most of the time, they are treated poorly by both K-pop agencies and TV stations.

&gt;We work day and night for our artists, but we dont get what we deserve from both sides. So most of our revenues come from outside of the industry, such as shooting ads. And people from advertisement complain that we stylists ask for too much money. What else can we do? We dont get paid from our main field, she explained. 

&gt;When Seo first started working, she wasnt paid for her job either. It took her three months to earn 300,000 won ($265) a month, she said. 

&gt;Seo emphasized that another of her goals is to pave the way for a better working environment for younger stylists. She will begin by educating junior stylists and communicating with the public through the creation of fashion content. Seo has been teaching students styling at Chungkang College of Cultural Industries since February last year. 

&gt;Did you know that S.M. gives the lowest salary for their artists and employees in the industry? They have this kind of mindset, You should thank us for being able to work with a superstar group like Girls Generation. 

Then talks about styling, how Big Bang influenced idols to start wearing outfits from designer collections, about Sooyoung being her fashion muse, Hyoyeon the most challenging member when it comes to styling, etc. Then:

&gt;Asked how she has been dealing with recent news that three members of the band Tiffany, Sooyoung and Seohyun did not renew their contracts with their agency, Seo shrugged and said, Well, I dont thinks its such a big deal, because I dont think Girls Generation will disband.

&gt;People keep asking my opinion about the issue as if its a big problem. If they are to disband, I would be heartbroken too, as Im also a huge fan of the group. But the thing is, members are not taking the matter seriously, and I personally think Girls Generation wont disband.",100,745,False,self,,,,,

You can do Soloists too if you want. Mini-albums don't count unless you make a seperate ranking for them. Try to add a few sentences detailing why you made the choices you did instead of just boringly listing them w/o any explanation lol. 



For SHINee,

**Favorite:** 1of1/ 1and1 Repackage FOR SURE. Odd/MttM is a close second though. 


I love literally every single thing about this album/comeback, but I already did a whole fangirl filled review about it in my [55 page SHINee paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GpnH2l4YazBVq9AntFUd75DHSzohifJSECW3mH1fzQE/edit?usp=sharing), if any of y'all wanna check that out ;D *shameless self promotion*

**Least Favorite:** Lucifer/ Hello Repackage

Again, my reasons for this are expanded more in the paper, but to summarize, while I like a lot of the tracks individually, the really excessive use of autotune and some of the really weird sfx/vocal effects (Onew's moans anyone?) really holds the album back for me. Even though it's not even their oldest album, it by far feels the most dated/immature out of all their discography, while their first album still holds up incredibly well today, and is absolutely a R&amp;B classic, imo. 

And for EXO,

**Favorite:** Ex'act/ Lotto Repackage
I'm actually in the middle of writing a paper about EXO in the same format as I did for the SHINee one, so I talk about this way more in depth there, but this is by **far** my favorite EXO album. I don't really get why so many people seem to consider it their weakest album either, as every single track here just exudes so much quality and polish to me. The majority of my all time favorite EXO tracks (She's Dreaming, Cloud 9, White Noise) can be found here too. I think EXO really shines when they go with more R&amp;B type songs and as this album is literally just full of R&amp;B bliss, it makes me very happy. 

**Least Favorite**: XOXO/ Growl Repackage
Like with Lucifer/Hello, I just think this is EXO's youngest sounding release (even moreso than Mama). None of the tracks are outright bad per se, they're just kinda weaker and standard cutesy boy band pop, and not as many tracks here stand out to me, especially compared to their more recent releases.

I eventually got into SNSD, Super Junior, Big Bang, 2NE1, f(x), INFINITE, I liked random songs from others groups but those were the ones I liked the best.

I moved on from my obsession, it lasted about 3 or 4 years, I just grew out of it and stopped watching variety and never cared for next gen groups. I still have all the songs on my iphone/ipod and listen to them form time to time. (I'm a major music hoarder)

It still makes me nostalgic to see all the groups I liked breaking up though, Jessica was my favorite SNSD member and I was genuinely sad when she left. Now almost all 2nd gen groups are gone, SNSD are now down to 5 members, Sully left f(x), Hoya left INFINITE, 2NE1 broke up, Big Bang had the T.O.P scandal and Onew (this is what actually brought me to post this) is accused of sexual harassment, (this is heartbreaking because he genuinely seems like a sweet and adorable guy and SHINee has had such a good run without any scandals, I have always seen them as one of the most solid groups out there along with Big Bang).

Maybe I'm just sad I'm growing old.",135,263,False,self,,,,,

r/kpop has now officially crossed the 250k mark for subscribers, so we thought it would be a good time to update everyone on traffic stats and the numbers behind the subreddit.  In case you don't know, our subscriber count exploded earlier this year and we explained what happened in [our 100K subs thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6bto5q/100000_subscribers_party/).  The short version is that Reddit admins added an on-boarding process to the mobile app which automatically subscribed people to subreddits based on categories they are interested in.  r/kpop was lucky enough to be one of those subreddits.  Our new subscriber count went from about 100 per day to [over 3000 per day](http://i.imgur.com/HLZK7uh.jpg) in an instant.  With that boost, our subscriber number skyrocketed past 100k and 200k in just a few months.  However, that would not last.

#### The End of Reddit Sajaegi

The Reddit admins were not finished with the on-boarding process and started to tweak the categories to make them more focused.  The 3000 new subs per day quickly fell to about 1500 per day after only a couple weeks.  Then, later it fell again, and again.  For the past month or so, we have been holding steady at about 400 new subscribers per day.  [Here's the current graph.](https://i.imgur.com/eVygUC7.jpg)  This is still four times our daily average from before this all started, but it's a far cry from the initial surge.  There may still be more changes as Reddit admins are starting to roll out on-boarding for desktop users as well, so it could go up again, or it could go back down if we get left out.  We have no idea and have no control over any of it, so I guess we'll see.  It is possible for us to completely opt out of onboarding, but we don't feel like the added users have had a bad impact so far, so we don't see any reason to do that right now.

#### How Many Of Us Are There?

The big question now is, what happened to all those subscribers?  Are they still here?  Well... yes and no.  [This graph shows our monthly and daily traffic.](https://i.imgur.com/PLFRKIQ.jpg)  Uniques are in orangered and pageviews are in periwinkle.  The red arrows show where the new on-boarding started in mid-May.  As you can see, our monthly uniques nearly doubled from April to June!  And although the total number has tapered off, it remains about 50% more than before the on-boarding started.  The same is true for the pageviews.  Oh, and in case you can't read those graphs, r/kpop gets about **8 MILLION** pageviews per month and has 500k unique visitors.  That's like... a lot.  Our daily average is about 35,000 uniques.  The spikes you see on the daily graph are major MV releases or news stories.

#### So Where Are They?

So if all these extra people are looking at our threads, why haven't comments and vote numbers exploded, too?  Certainly things like votes and comments are *indicators* of activity, but the numbers above are the hard facts.  There are a lot more people looking at r/kpop and clicking on our threads than before.  There is no doubt about that.  However, the initial returns of the [current 2017 Census](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/756lov/reddit_kpop_census_2017/) look like we'll probably have quite a few **less** responses than last year.  By the way, if you haven't filled that out yet, please do!  It seems that r/kpop is mostly about *passive consumption* of content, and that's sort of the way we designed it.  This means that there isn't a lot of user-generated content (r/kpoppers) outside of a few amazing features that a small handful of dedicated fans create.  That sort of passive culture probably lowers overall participation, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  We think most people who love r/kpop, love it because it's different from other K-Pop forums on the internet.  Low participation is one of the side-effects of that difference.  All-in-all though, vote numbers **are** up.  If you look at the [top all-time page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all), nearly every submission on the first page is from this year.  At the end of 2016, we only had four threads over 2000 votes.  Today, we have **twenty-seven**, including two topping 4000!

#### Moving Forward

We'll continue to keep an eye on the subscriber numbers and the on-boarding process as we wait and see what the Reddit admins have in store next.  If we feel it's making things worse, we'll opt out of it, but so far, so good.  The added numbers help people find us and give us a little more weight when we go in search of things like AMAs.  As always, we'll be listening to your feedback both in these comments and in future town halls.  Let us know what you think of these numbers, subreddit participation, and the overall direction and culture of the subreddit.  Thank you all for subscribing and being the best K-Pop community on the internet.  Here's to the next quarter-million!",36,240,False,self,,,,,

However, without Jonghyun back with Nu'est, they probably wouldn't have been able to come back in a subunit, and if they did come back with 3 they certainly wouldn't have been as successful as they have been thus far.  It's almost a best case scenario for Nu'est, as they can still do well as Nu'est W while gaining even more exposure through Minhyun being in Wanna One simultaneously.

To keep up with the show, here's a [timeline](https://mobile.twitter.com/sujusnaps/status/917208859420315649) (second pic in tweet). Basically, 2 episodes ~5-7 minutes long at 11 am KST Mon-Fri for 6 weeks till Nov. 17, released on Naver (no subs) and V Live. I recommend following their V Live channel as they're subbed in English the moment they're uploaded. ",6,33,False,self,,,,,

Like always Ill do a brief recap of the past jukebox. Last week ya girls  of both the Cosmic and Generational kind  were on the jukebox, as well as BTS, KARA, and more! [The results are in!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_last_week.2019s_results)^1 You can review all the full results and reviews [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_full_rankings). The highest rated song from last week was **Girls Generations Goodbye**, with an overall score of 8.33! 

[Link to last weeks thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/76eayr/jukebox_5_float_like_a_miraculous_mister/)

I feel sparks ^yeahhhh ...Its just me ^~ohhhhhhhhh

Cause baby I just got this feeling ^^whoaaaaaaaa  Come on, come on, let's do it!

Its the third week of the month, which means its Artist Spotlight Week! [Our last Artist Spotlight featured the legendary Wonder Girls](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/71kfu6/jukebox_2_were_back/), where we discussed songs from their heyday all the way up to their last single album release. So, who was picked this month? Hmmm....here are some hints: [theyre known for self-replicating](https://i.imgur.com/Vv2U3mF.jpg), [sacrifices](http://i.imgur.com/Phcfzda.jpg), and [sweet but strong vocals](https://i.imgur.com/j4Wi7K3.jpg). Thats right! This months Artist Spotlight is indeed r/kpops darlings, Red Velvet! Without further ado, here are this weeks songs:

1. [[MV] LOO/Kim Lip - Eclipse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qJEoSa3Ie0)
2. [KARD - Dont Recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Dp7Q-SM1Y)
3. [Red Velvet - Body Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37GkANTikEw)
4. [Red Velvet - Light Me Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7pEmC7xgM)
5. [INFINITE - The Chaser ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgmSImDoJNg)
6. [WINNER - But ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBqgGN5j3VQ)
7. [Red Velvet - Zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6iYILG1rY)

Real quick rules recap: write a review, give a score between 1-10, inclusive, leave review as a reply to the comment with the song title. Try for about 80 words if you can, and give us your thoughts and opinions on the song/ranking. Review only one song or all seven, however much you feel like writing. [MV] tag = you can review both the video and the music, but thats totally optional and up to you.

***NOTE: I DO NOT PICK THE SONGS OR SPOTLIGHTS.*** It is probably well-known that I love Red Velvet, but they really were randomly picked for Artist Spotlight, (I'll add screenshots in comments, and I actually tried to randomly generate another artist but the generator still gave me Red Velvet so I just accepted it). That said, I did pick Body Talk, but not because I personally wanted to  from the user-submitted B-side nominations, Body Talk was actually the most submitted B-side (even though I said SHINee was the most submitted artist, Body Talk had the most nominations). Since it seems that so many people want to review this song that multiple people submitted it, I decided to add it since Red Velvet happens to be the Artist Spotlight this week. However, all the other songs were randomly generated!

Lookie lookie, SNSD entered #4 on r/kpops Top 10 Jukebox Songs! Its the 4th highest ranked song of all time. Closer is still going strong at #1 and I am pretty sure that, at this point, its going to stay there (or at least at the top of the chart) for a long time. 

[Full Top Ten Chart Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_the_jukebox_chart_-_the_top_10_songs)

1: __NEW FEATURES __ Since I figured some of you might want to just be able to see the scores instead of having to scroll through all the rankings to find the most updated ones, I put in a new section called [Last Weeks Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_last_week.2019s_results) which will have the song and the score. Itll have the artist, song title, overall score, and the mode score (the most commonly given score). WINNER's song ""But"" was picked using a new list: [the rainy day playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWQn87C6nAbijbEV7AjjXql3rLqBLpdb7) I compiled. I thought it would be appropriate to use since it's fall and it's starting to get to weather more suited for that kind of thing. I'll probably use it once or twice a month when I need to find an extra song for a thread. Hope that's okay! If not, let me know in the comments.

Alright, thats it for now! Do you know when the next Eclipse is? Is love really looking like a zoo? Dont recall? Thats okay, you probably will once you listen to this weeks songs! Have fun reviewing and thanks for participating!

It serves as a way to get the public to know more about the members and I find these shows especially interesting because it's endearing to see how passionate rookie idols are on these shows as opposed to varieties from older groups who are generally more relaxed. So I was wondering what some of your favourite rookie realities are?

Personally, 2PM's season of Idol Army is an absolute classic - a must watch for any 2PM stan tbh. Their variety skills were A-level from the beginning. Speaking of As and levels, I really enjoyed Wanna One Go - the variety was the final push in my decision to stan them because they just gelled really well as a group (much better than I expected tbh) and Minhyun/Jaehwan were an adorable mess.",57,80,False,self,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;

You may have heard of KNK from /r/kpop for the following reasons: [going viral within the Korean spinning community](https://redd.it/4qqbua), [not releasing an MV for one of their comebacks](https://redd.it/5d2tz9) (An [MV for the Japanese version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwmuG8bewwU) was released for it though ^(if you can get past the editing)), or the [dramatic reading of *Despacito*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmYZv2XuDJU). I'm assuming the majority of you have, at most, vaguely heard of KNK so I provided plenty of photos in the imgur albums to help you ~~and not because I already had these photos~~.

#Intro

**[KNK](https://imgur.com/a/YkNNS)** (Korean: , Romanization: KeuNaKeun, Japanese: ) is a five-member boy group under YNB Entertainment (BESTie, Noel, Almeng, + 40). 

There are a few ways to interpret their team name:

1. It could mean K-pop kNocK which means to knock on the doors of Kpop.
2. In Korean,  means *to be someone great,* so it could also mean to become great people in the music industry.
 - To add onto this, they've mentioned that a few role models include [G.O.D + Shinhwa](https://youtu.be/UqdHLBbQj3w?t=8m20s) and they hope to earn nation's title (ie nation's ____).
3.  could also means *big* or *large*, so they've been asked multiple times in interviews if their height has anything to do with their team name. 


&amp;nbsp;

**Members:** [Kim Youjin](https://imgur.com/a/iBrCe), [Park Seungjun](https://imgur.com/a/2nkyG), [Jeong Inseong](https://imgur.com/a/6Ocof), [Kim Jihun](https://imgur.com/a/PDOU1), and [Oh Heejun](https://imgur.com/a/7OSZB)

**Debut Date:** March 3, 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

**Fanclub name:** Tinkerbells ^(yes ^really)

- Seungjun came up with the name.
 - Inseong's explanation:  ""Ill tell you why we named our fan club as TinkerBell. As you know, we are KNK. To indicate that youre little fairies who protect *big guys* (KNK means big in Korean). You guys are little fairies. Thats why we named our fan club TinkerBell. As you know, Tinker Bell in the original fiction protects big guys, right? And we, big guys, protect little fairies So, this is our behind story of TinkerBell.  (Comes from the second video I listed below)
-  They've been asked what they [think about their male fans](http://www.vlive.tv/video/10800) (4:05) and what [the male fans should do](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3zm8hn?start=2027), but Seungjun is adamant that Tinkerbells can be both male and female. [Here's his drawing of Tinkerbells](https://i.imgur.com/XkIPyTI.jpg)

&amp;nbsp;

**Official colors:** [Rose Gold and Twinkle Silver](https://i.imgur.com/iVsBAb6.jpg)
 &gt; Rose Gold represent Warm and tender KNK 

 &gt; Twinkle Silver represents The protective and twinkling fairies [(S)](http://fy-knk.tumblr.com/post/157906373814/)

###Trainee History

I included a part of an interview back from March 2016 where each explains how they became singers as additional info. Some information may be redundant with what I have written.

&gt;**How did you guys become singers?**

&gt;When I was in 6th grade I heard Snow Flower. It was then that I came into contact with pop music for the first time. I think from then on I ended up taking interest in music little by little, and after that during a festival in my 3rd year in middle school I danced and it was surprisingly fun. The process of preparing for the stage of course was also fun. During high school I worked part-time and learned things I wanted to learn one by one as I attended school. I got advice from my school teacher and luckily entered TS Entertainment where I was in a team set to debut. Afterwards I left and was preparing to enter college when a staff member told me to foster my dreams. So I ended up starting over and auditioned for our current company.

###Trainee History

&gt;**How did you guys become singers?**

&gt; I dreamed of being a language teacher. A teachers desk looked cool. (Laughs) In my 3rd year of high school, my friend told me he was going to audition for SM Entertainment so we went together. but I ended up auditioning along with him as well. They said theyd send me to another company from there, but it was JYP Entertainment. So I went to audition again and was cast on the street by Big Hit on my way there. So I auditioned and contracted with them, I think I was a trainee for 2 years. After that I entered JYP again.

&gt; **You followed your friend and it changed your fate.**

&gt; I wasnt interested at all, but now its exciting when I think about it. I liked listening to songs a lot so even when I auditioned I sang a song I liked. [(S)](http://keunakeun.tumblr.com/post/142138252148)

###Trainee History

&gt;**How did you guys become singers?**

&gt; From elementary school to my third year in middle school, I was a swimmer for 8 years. I got hurt so I couldnt do it anymore and since then I pushed forward in my studies. During a school trip in my third year of middle school, I sang at a talent show but the response was great. Since then I knew the taste of the stage. (Laughs) I told my mom Id go to an art school, passed my exams, and as I entered a high school for practical music I was cast on the street. I was a trainee at Big Hit Entertainment for 2 years then left and entered FNC.  [(S)](http://keunakeun.tumblr.com/post/142138252148)

&amp;nbsp;

###Trainee History

&gt;**How did you guys become singers?**

&gt; My dream was to be a taekwondo athlete. From when I was 8 until I was 15 I did taekwondo. As I gave it up I enjoyed listening to music and watching the performances of singers. One day on TV I saw SHINees Replay and they were really cool. Since then that was the only dream I had, so after I passed the audition at the place called SM Academy, I attended it, and then started training at Nega Network. [(S)](http://keunakeun.tumblr.com/post/142138252148)

- He was in SM Academy and was a former trainee at Nega Networks
 - There are a few videos available during his time in SM Academy, such as:
      - Dance cover for [*On and On* by VIXX](https://youtu.be/xm04Yxj18so) (He played N's part)
      - [*Fantastic Baby* by Big Bang cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6KT3g3TyfA) (He's the one in the mask)
      - [* * by Dramatic Blue cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mg48RfySIM)  (White shirt and blue scarf)
      - [Compilation of his solo covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCffN8thGC0) 

 - Joined YNB because of Dahye

      &gt;Together with girl group Bestie Member Dahye Noona we came from SM Academy. A close hyung and Dahye noona introduced me to YNB Entertainment. If they didnt give me that suggestion then I would be in a contract situation with Nega Network. If YNB Entertainment Director hadnt said, Someday lets work together it would be too bad. After 3 months I left Nega Network to build my own nest. [(S)](http://fy-knk.tumblr.com/post/143596931004)

###Trainee History


&gt;**How did you guys become singers?**

&gt;From elementary school to my third year in middle school I played soccer. In the beginning of my third year I suffered an injury and couldnt play, so after that I was cast into FNC Entertainment and trained for 4 years. I was responsible for vocals and playing an instrument but our teams debut had fallen through, so I started again in our company now.

&gt; **Did you dream to be a singer since you had played soccer?**

&gt; Its not like I joined because I needed to be a singer. I think that because I became a trainee I realized I had the qualities for it and dreamt of it since then. [(S)](http://keunakeun.tumblr.com/post/142138252148)

---

#**Background**

The average training years for KNK is 5  5 years for Inseong, Jihun, Seungjun, 4 for Heejun, and 3 for Youjin.

##**Predebut**

In 2013, there were 4 people in YNB Boys: Youjin, Seungjun, Jihun, and former trainee Lee Hwan. YNB released 2 videos with them in masks, presumably as like a way to create hype. [One was them dancing to Love Options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b0KG8HY90I) (From left to right: Seungjun, Jihun, Lee Hwan, and Youjin) ^(How people figured out who's who - I don't know). And [the other was of them miming BESTie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zas0hOnoHG8). (Left to right: Youjin, Jihun, Lee Hwan, and Seungjun). They also appeared on BESTie's *Zzang Christmas* [MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S40k0Bx5puE) and [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWbXQ09fGI0).


In 2014, Inseong and Heejun joined and presumably Lee Hwan left. Everyone but Youjin then became a backup dancer for [BESTie's *I Need You*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CrdiDkHFjk) and Inseong and Seungjun appeared in [Bestie's *Excuse Me* MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuVi2ib-0qQ).


There was a [rumor that they were supposed debut in 2014](https://www.instiz.net//pt/2062934). This actually lines up with the fact that they had debut song *Knock* for about 2 years. You can see how the song and choreo changed when comparing the original [choreo](https://twitter.com/KNKOfficialYNB/status/843423602707845120) and [lyrics](http://www.vlive.tv/video/14070) (2:30) to what we [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1NPO-H06xU) [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYVDIZcb6Og).

- They also mentioned in the V Live about having an orchestra for their [debut stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXBVeSBYlNc), but that fell through.


In addition, there were so many names before they ended up with  such as [5 Boys,' Guys,' Reality,' Climax, Must One,' The Rose of Sharon,' Insiders,](http://keunakeun.tumblr.com/post/145377334643) ['Kaiser,' and 'To the O'](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/06/what-are-the-unique-group-names-that-knk-might-have-debuted-under). They mentioned that they wanted a cool English name and [they couldn't believe their name was going to be .](https://youtu.be/6FOX-QZjnYg?t=2m1s) For a period, they also had stage names; [Youjin's was UL, Seungjun's Yoonjae, Jihun's four/ace](https://youtu.be/VcYvdVr-kHI).

#Discography

Credit goes to EchoedHeart on discord for writing this section. There was no way I would have written this as well as he did.

##Knock

&gt; [*Knock*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5987S3bfu2fiktlchX9Syy) well.. [it] doesn't sound like anything they've made after it. As a debut track, [it] was perfect for KNK as it sounded nothing like the 2016 kpop music landscape, therefore marked their style as a different group in terms of sound.

##Awake

&gt; [*Awake*](https://open.spotify.com/album/3pHQqBzN1WTpDEqvNiMX08) as a whole is a ballad album except for [*Back Again*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp34Lfv3OLc) and [*Day N Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEq67u3JL9s) which are both synth pop very reminiscent of the start of K-Pop. [The ballads from *Awake*] are R&amp;B based.

##Remain


&gt; [*Remain*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2QzvPDKoYTNewgXDxeFQ8P) is by far the most poppy [album] they have but it has 3 pop tracks and 2 ballads. [The album] starts off with a Retro-ish slow pop song [[*Stay*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVANJ6suu3A)] that's followed by the title / dance track [*U*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8sfxDj9OJ4), which followed the then trend of a fast paced beat with EDM [at] its core but not necessarily the core of the song. Then [*Beauty*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUV2tl3v4tA) is another ballad-turned-synth pop song. After these 3, the album slows down [with] [*I Know*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6Q2yI271wA), a ballad heavily focused on a slow tempo and the drums in the background that just carry the song in its whole. [Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqE0cLxhhhU) doesn't necessarily pick up the pace but it's not the same thing as *I Know* and again it keeps up with KNK's style of 2 instruments carrying the song [in the background] along with the members' voices. The album concludes with [*Tonight*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81KmnAQaJcI) a dance track [with a] very retro/disco style, noticeable by the crazy sound effects [that is] very reminiscent of the '80s.

##Gravity, Completed

&gt; [*Gravity, Completed*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4U5LWdNb4lG8IAA4m5KUxd) is the most confusing though, their title [[*Rain*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MWc2NXtit4)] is Jazz R&amp;B; [*Feel So Good*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycex30cSNwo) follows Afro-House trend with R&amp;B; [*Good Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VxqVInUNB4) is the typical KNK ballad; and then you have [*Think About You*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgK_AIwRvU4) that soothes out *Feel So Good* and readies you for [*Love You*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umklJTp3F3o) which is synth pop.

#Japan Debut

This doesn't pertain so much to their Japan debut more so than it does with their activities while in Japan. They started having mini lives/concerts in Japan on January. So far, the concerts were grouped together in a set of 3 concerts per 2 days. /u/charlieedog had the pleasure to attend one of their concerts from April and wrote a [fan account](https://redd.it/65iyj4).

- I would like to also mention the time a [little girl came dressed as Tinkerbell](https://twitter.com/jmh____m/status/817367579492651008) during one of their concerts in January.


On October 11th, they released their debut singleU / BACK AGAINand have recently completed all their release events in Japan. Heejun and Inseong did a [V Live](http://www.vlive.tv/video/44079/) while in Japan at 2 in the morning which I would recommend watching if you just want to see them talk about general things. And it's short too (~ 11 minutes).


 Chart-wise, they're doing pretty well.

- For example, for the Daily Singles Ranking on Oricon, they:
 - Ranked 6th for [17.10.10](http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/d/2017-10-10/) + [10.13](http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/d/2017-10-13/)
 - [7th for 17.10.11](http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/d/2017-10-11/)
 - [and 3rd for 17.10.14](http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/d/2017-10-14/) + [10.15](http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/d/2017-10-15/)


- They also ranked 1st for the Shibuya Towers Daily Total Chart for [17.10.11](https://twitter.com/TOWER_Shibuya/status/918280263766908928) + [17.10.15](https://twitter.com/TOWER_Shibuya/status/919730364750348288) and [2nd for Tower Records Stores General Single Chart](https://twitter.com/TOWER_Info/status/918276202753802240)

- And they [ranked 7th for Oricon's Weekly Single Rankings for 17.10.09 - 10.15](http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2017-10-23/)

##V Live Broadcast

In addition to *MKT,* a great way to see their personalities and their dynamic as a group is through their V Live broadcasts. Their first broadcast was on [February 1, 2016](http://www.vlive.tv/video/5355) and their longest one was for [12 hours](http://www.vlive.tv/video/25147) which set the record for [V Live](https://www.soompi.com/2017/03/17/knk-hold-record-length-12-hour-live-broadcast/). My first recommendation would be [**when they played VR**](http://www.vlive.tv/video/24611) because they usually have 2 sides when it comes to their V Lives: loud and chill. It's pretty self explanatory, but to still explain, for **loud**, there's a lot of screaming and laughing - usually because there is a game involved - whereas **chill** is just them talking with the fans and telling stories. Screaming and laughing probably still applies tbh, but it's not as chaotic. Some other recommendations are:

#Closing

First off, I want to say I did not intend for this to be so long  it just happened. I was at 14k thinking I was almost done; then I just added more and more and more. I decided to not include some other info if you can believe that. If you read all of it, thank you so much! If you scrolled to the bottom of this, hey, thank you for at least opening this post. Hopefully I formatted this well enough that it's clear to read it.


My goal for this Spotlight was just to get their name out there. So if your main takeaway from this is that there is a group called KNK, then I'm content. They are a group that I believe deserves more recognition but of course I'm saying that as a fan. I hope they become a group that some of you will look forward to in either their music or any of their future endeavors really, but it's understandable if that's not the case. Thanks again!",17,192,False,self,,,,,

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

1. Epik High - WDSW - The reason I'm making this post lol. To me, this album was so good from start to finish - it even surpassed Shoebox which was one of my ult. fav kpop albums. There is not one song in the album that I can skip. Fav. Track: Home is Far Away.

2. GD - Kwon Ji Yong - I think this is the most personal album I've heard from anyone. I love that it makes the distinction between Kwong Ji Yong and GDragon and does justice to them both. From start to finish, every song has its purpose, its distinct mood and the entire album is just a beautifully written story. Fav. Track: Superstar

3. HyukOh - 23 - I mean. Its HyukOh. Some forgettable B tracks but as an album, nothing's out of place and I love how many different moods the album incorporates. Fav. Track: Tomboy.

4. Bobby - Love and Fall - Damn. This was a revelation lol. I thought the title tracks were forgettable at first but the chorus for Runaway kept blaring at the back of my head. I love his voice in this and he did a good job making his voice stand out and not scream/shout in my ear. I love most tracks. Also love the variety in the album. Its a good mix of personal, chill, intense and lit lol. It doesnt feel the most complete but I cant pick a track I dislike. Fav. Track: Runaway/Firework

5. IU - Palette. 2017 was basically IU's bitch. The only reason Palette isnt higher up in my list is because I felt like there were too many ballads in the album and some B-sides were not all too distinct/rememberable. This album is what Koreans mean when they say 'Healing' lol.

* This is the tenth installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! 
**Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  
* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 
* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Solo Artists**!

* OST means ""Official Sound Track""
* Songs that were for a K-drama/movie.
* Any Korean artist. Idol or solo.
* They can be new or old.
* Put where it comes from as well.

Here are my contributions -

(I don't know many OSTs so...)

* [Crush - Beautiful (from Goblin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5TJcaHO2gU)

OST playlist [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdvCSWXU--UllvT2Rejrkufb)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.
* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)
* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

For anyone who doesnt know what they do - they basically translate comments from korean news articles on usually somewhat noteworthy events to capture knetizens reactions. 

And while their translations of the comments might be accurate, by ""pushing misleading narratives"" I mean NB has a way of not just translating the top upvoted comments from these articles. but cherry picking  a select few to usually match whatever narrative theyre trying to get their readers to believe all koreans think. But tbh anyone who thinks a handful of translated comments from a news article reflects what a whole nation thinks is an idiot anyway. 

For example, sometimes they'll purposefully choose to translate comments from less popular notoriously bitter Nate instead of identical articles and other more popular comments on Naver when they're really desperate to find negative shit. 

Anyway I was curious to see actual examples of stories twisted by NB. I'm sure most fanbases have had their own run ins with how they've chosen to translate some things. And I guess this discussion can serve as a good reminder that NB is most definitely not an unbiased source. ",96,149,False,self,,,,,

Obviously both songs were released in autumn; some other specific similarities I've noted are:

* The songs are slow, but still have a beat and don't fit the typical ""ballad"" label
* There is a key change at the climax of the songs
* For performances the boys are dressed in non-matching suits/suit jackets 
* The choreography incorporates sign language
* The stages incorporate warm and earthy colors

I'm curious to know what people think is unique to their fandom - perhaps someone else might say it isn't or perhaps it is truly unique, who knows. I'm just interested in seeing all the creative ways fans have come up with to interact and such within KPop :) Note: it doesn't have to be some huge thing that *every fan ever* knows about, just something that is fairly well known/common within the fandom. 

To start things off, I'll go with Vixx. Within the Starlight fandom, each Vixx member has an emoticon 'face' that we use to represent them in things like text comments, translations, and so on (ie. instead of typing their name, we use their 'face') - this is done by both K and I fans. It's just as common for us to see [this](https://imgur.com/QkzmWt2) as it is [this](https://imgur.com/hWG4PA6). It's so common within the fandom that [even the Vixx members use them](http://translatedvixx.tumblr.com/post/165686631888/realvixxjapan).

There are various others, but these are the most common for each member: 

* N: @.@ 
* Leo:  
* Ken:  
* Ravi: /_\ 
* Hongbin: '' 
* Hyuk: -w-

(Starlights are represented by a star, duh hehe)

Now, personally, I haven't seen this done with other groups, but I would love to see the 'faces' other people use for their favs if it is :D

Another example, this time from Stellar: for most Twinkles, Rocket Girl isn't really counted in Stellar's discography and Minhee and Hyoeun are original members (ie. to us, Stellar didn't *really* start until they joined and released UFO). And, although they still performed the song on their anniversary and we use its release date as their anniversary, even [TEP doesn't count Rocket Girl](https://twitter.com/officialSTELLAR/status/899914876583149568).

I know it's not really ""unique"" for a group to be cringy towards their debut song - even Vixx likes to call On and On their debut - but when fans and even the company don't acknowledge it... that's a whole new ball game xD lol",135,135,False,self,,,,,

2091,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-10-28,2017,10,28,5,7960jp,self.kpop,Seoul Awards caught in controversy over misunderstanding regarding Wanna One's Kang Daniel,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7960jp/seoul_awards_caught_in_controversy_over/,tastetherainbeau,1509137942,"Summary of what happened (taking points from [this Soompi article](https://www.soompi.com/2017/10/27/wanna-ones-agency-responds-misunderstanding-kang-daniel-seoul-awards/)):

During the Seoul Awards, it was announced that Kang Daniel would be a presenter with T-ara's Eunjung.

When it was time for them to present, Eunjung arrived onstage and said 

&gt; Kang Daniel, who was going to be a presenter with me, is on his way but [has been delayed] due to traffic

leading viewers to believe that he missed a schedule due to being late.

YMC made a statement after this, saying *Kang Daniel was never scheduled to be a presenter*

&gt; Its true that all the members of Wanna One, including Kang Daniel, planned to take part in The Seoul Awards through a congratulatory performance. However, Kang Daniel presenting an award was not something that had been discussed in advance. Right before the event, we received an offer from the organizers asking if Kang Daniel could take part as a presenter. We clearly told them that he would not be able to participate due to his schedule. There was only time for him to take part in the congratulatory performance. It is unfortunate that despite that fact, it was portrayed as though he had disrupted the event because of a mistake and lateness.

Then a Seoul Awards representative confirmed YMC's statement, translation by [@ongbokki](https://twitter.com/ongbokki/status/923873752202461184):

&gt; We did not confirm Kang Daniel as the presenter. The full schedule was just solely performing. Initially, we thought he had other schedules so we are very grateful that they are even able to perform here...however it seems like there is some kind of misunderstanding going on.

The representative said there was an emergency request that morning to have him as presenter but they were informed from YMC that there was not enough time for it to happen.

[Netizen comments translated by ongbokki](https://twitter.com/ongbokki/status/923899314216120320)

Fans are demanding an official apology from Seoul Awards because the news about Daniel ""missing a schedule because he was late"" has spread quite a bit.

T-ara's Eunjung was also unfortunately caught in the crossfire since she was the one who said he was running late, despite the fact that she was simply reading from a script.",14,64,False,self,,,,,

So one of my good friends aunt is a fashion designer and ohhyuk has worn a lot of her pieces and he invited her to his concert in London but she couldnt make it since she just had a baby so she let her niece, my sister and I go in her place. Originally we were all meant to go but the tickets sold out before we could book any so essentially we went for free. The show was great, we got there for 5 and got all access passes, got in the venue by 7, show started at 8. Set list is on google somewhere but it was amazing, love hyukoh so much. Theyre amazing live. We actually couldve went backstage before the show but the security guard confused us for vip and said no but afterwards we were allowed. A lady told us we could have free cds which we forgot to collect lol oh well. Ohhyuk is beautiful. His bald head is my life his soft voice is my life his shortness is my life. He looked at us like idk who u guys are but we explained and he was like ah and shook my friends hand whos aunt is the designer lol. We took pictures and I said   and he laughed. Then we met the whole band and took more pictures and ohhyuk was actually at the end and I was in the middle next to my friends so I was thinking ohhyuk should be in the middle, Ill be at the end. So I said hyukohnim and swapped with him. I didnt realise till I left that I called him hyukoh not ohhyuk lol. He signed my shirt and was laughing hes so so so cute ugh love him (I pinned the shirt to my wall lol). We couldve stuck around since no one told us to leave since we had passes but my friends didnt wanna be rude so we said goodbye and left. Kinda regret not getting a video of meeting him but I took pictures and the opportunity itself was enough. 

TL;DR: this fanaccount sucks but you know who doesnt suck; hyukoh.

But first, before we get to this weeks Jukebox, lets go over last weeks results! The previous Jukebox was a spotlight on Red Velvet but featured KARD, INFINITE, WINNER, and Kim Lip as well! And many reviews later, the results are in! You can review [last weeks results here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_last_week.2019s_results). To see all the full rankings and reviews plus last weeks reviews and excerpts, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_full_rankings)! Fun fact: last weeks Jukebox was the first time weve ever had every single song on the Jukebox have at least one review with a full score of 10! It was quite impressive really (and, as youll see, it really shook up the Top 10 Chart). Anyways, the highest rated song of last week was **Red Velvets Zoo**, with an overall score of 8.60! 

Are you curious (yeahhhhhhhh)? Are you gonna try Sunmi? Will you tell Jihyo that youll be her baby? 

**Wait up girl, hold on!**

Its the weekend before Halloween, which means  yep, thats right! This weeks Jukebox is Halloween-themed! It actually worked out surprisingly well when everything was randomly picked haha, so Im happy with how it turned out. Heres this weeks spooky songs!

1. [TWICE - TT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePpPVE-GGJw)

~~If you hate emojis I'm sorry, I just thought it would be fun because it's Halloween!~~

While it may be a spooky week, dont let your fear have you forget what to do! Write a review and give a score between 1-10 as a reply to the comment with the song title. 80 words is a good length; give us your thoughts and opinions on the song/ranking! Review only one or all seven songs, totally up to you! If theres an [MV] tag, you can review both the video and the music, but thats totally optional and up to you.

**As a reminder, downvoting someones comment/review does not affect the overall score a song gets.** [As I said in the very first thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/): Downvoting someone's comment/rate doesn't change the overall score. I am literally just going to be taking each of the scores you assign and average them, then assign the mean of those ratings to the song. Also, __I DO NOT PICK__ (most of) the Jukebox songs! They are randomly generated. I picked TWICEs TT because I get to pick a song this week; I decided to skip over the OST that was supposed to be on here and included Married to the Music instead because its Halloween weekend and it really fit perfectly!

[Full Top Ten Chart Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index/jukebox#wiki_the_jukebox_chart_-_the_top_10_songs)

Lookie Lookie, Zoo is our #2 highest rated song! There were a lot of changes in the chart this week  three songs entered the chart and were ranked over 8.00! Normally it's only one or two songs ranked that high (if any), so this was a surprise. LOO and KARD entered the charts! Hopefully this means that somehow eventually those two will also enter the actual iChart. One day. Woohoo! After having a fun month on the charts, we say goodbye to Red Flavor and hello to the reign of Zoo! Im pretty sure its going to be up there for awhile. And, once again, Oh My Girls Closer (for three weeks now) has maintained its spot on the #1. I really do think its gonna be there in the #1 spot for awhile, but who knows! Maybe Ill be eating my words next week. Although Red Velvet got very close(r)...^Im ^closer ^^Im ^^closer ~~theyre always blocked from that #1 spot~~

**NOTE:** 1. Because there was no distinction made between which version of It Was Love should be reviewed (the person who submitted this ballad said Taeil or Luna both are great), were reviewing both! For the links on the song list: Luna links to her version, Taeil links to his version, and It Was Love links to their duet version from KCON 2016. Since this is a special case: if you want to only review either Lunas or Taeils rendition, please indicate so and leave a review/score as normal. HOWEVER, if you would like to rate the song OVERALL, please try to discuss both versions AND the performance duet and then leave an overall rating for the song. For example: Luna/Taeil was great, 70 more words on why he/she did this song justice. 8/10 OR Luna and Taeil were both great in their individual versions, now lets just talk about how they saved KCON France 2016, 10/10. 

Alright, thats it for now! Do you love TWICE so much, or are you like TT about them? Are you excited that SHINees back? How about two of the former Wonder Girls? Find out and listen to this weeks songs! Have fun reviewing, thanks for participating, and I hope you have a happy (and safe!!!) Halloween weekend!

However, as Paul McCartney said, there is a reason love is incorporated into music and film so extensively and I don't think love songs or romantic lyrics are inferior in any way because of how widespread they are (if done right of course).

For me, there are a lot of great lyrics to choose from, but I'm going to go with the bridge in Winner's Really Really:

'If I made you uncomfortable

Just let me know

Ill take a step back

Just be a guy you know'

After a barrage of boy group songs with questionable lyrics on consent, I found it really sweet and refreshing how the lyrics really emphasised the girl being comfortable. Of course, angsty lyrics are also welcome.

Let me know if there's any mistakes in the post. 

To keep up with the show, here's a [timeline](https://twitter.com/sujusnaps/status/917208859420315649) (second pic in tweet). Basically, 2 episodes ~5-7 minutes long at 11 am KST Mon-Fri for 6 weeks till Nov. 17, released on Naver (no subs) and V Live. I recommend following their V Live channel as they're subbed in English the moment they're uploaded.

2217,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-10-30,2017,10,30,7,79jpnj,self.kpop,Now that both Mix9 and The Unit have aired....,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/79jpnj/now_that_both_mix9_and_the_unit_have_aired/,djdjowgjmbs,1509316907,"Which one do you prefer? More importantly, which one do you believe will come close to P101's hype or even surpass it? Or will neither be able to reach that level? Obviously, people on this sub and Kpop fans in general who will be watching the shows regardless may think it's too early to tell, but most of the general public really only watch the pilot episode and then decide if they want to continue watching the series. No one has the patience to stick around for the second episode so the pilot really plays a huge role in capturing viewer interest. P101 was able to capture both the traditional Kpop market as well as the general public.

Personally, Mix9's premise is more interesting and the editing is a lot more like P101 which might help it succeed. It also doesn't take itself as seriously as The Unit and is a lot more fun to watch imo. What worked for P101 was the easy to follow concept and the constant switches between serious and lighthearted tones (sombre team battle montages were usually cut by fun dance battles, visual rankings, arm wrestling matches, charades etc) which helped it remain interesting. While I get that it's the show's premise, The Unit is a little too emo for me. I understand the contestants' pain, but a viewer can only take so many sob stories per episode. 

Also, I'll just post the first episode ratings of both shows for a better understanding of how each season is doing so far:

KBS The Unit (public broadcast) : 6.2%  [source] (https://twitter.com/OH_mes/status/924410107290640388)

JTBC Mix Nine (cable broadcast) : 1.919% [source](https://twitter.com/OH_mes/status/924758305943314433)

The ratings for pilot episodes of both Produce seasons (both cable broadcasts):

Mnet Produce 101 Season 1: 1.04% [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produce_101#Ratings)

Mnet Produce 101 Season 2: 1.638% [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produce_101_Season_2#Ratings)

Edit: Worth noting that Mnet's most popular survival show Show Me The Money has always hovered around the 2.0% mark)

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

2367,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-10-31,2017,10,31,20,79v237,self.kpop,SM Entertainment has re branded their SMTOWN social media accounts!,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/79v237/sm_entertainment_has_re_branded_their_smtown/,PrimaryCrusaders,1509448758,"They've updated their YouTube, Twitter and Facebook pages with a brand new [logo](https://www.facebook.com/smtown/photos/a.203446293031546.46582.200739259968916/1559260327450129/?type=3&permPage=1) and several new banners for each of their pages. 

Here's what each of their social media pages currently look like:

[Facebook](https://imgur.com/7Uv3iqa)

[Twitter](https://imgur.com/kwV8xNF)

and of course, their [YouTube page](https://imgur.com/xCiGiHJ).


 They've also renamed the majority of their artist's MVs that have been posted (on both their current SMTOWN channel, and their former sment channel).

 Before, the titles went usually like this:

 ""Artist_Song Title_Music Video / Dance Practice / etc."" (e.g ""SHINee _Sherlock  (Clue + Note)_Music Video"")

Now, their music video branding is more like this:

""Artist (Hangul for artist's name) 'Song' MV"" (e.g. ""SHINee  'Sherlock  (Clue + Note)' MV"") 

Nearly all of the titles have already been updated with this format. (Though some, like SNSD's Japanese MVs for example, have yet to be updated)

Their descriptions have also changed to this format: 


""(Artist)'s (form of release) (title) has been released. Stream on iTunes & Apple Music, Spotify & Google Play Music: (either the aforementioned links or a generic ""Coming Soon!""notice)""

There are several variations, including this from EXO's ""Monster"" MV:


""EXO has released their 3rd full album EXACT with double title tracks Monster and Lucky One. 
Listen and download on iTunes & Apple Music, Spotify, and Google Play Music (then a link)""

There's already a mixed response to this re-branding / logo change, but I personally think it's a great update from their [previous logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/S.M._Entertainment_logo.svg/800px-S.M._Entertainment_logo.svg.png).
