#TALKING POINTS

##GENERAL

* There has been an increase in the amount of response to this year's census. 3,000 more compared to last year's. (2016: 6465, 2015: 3426)
* Still have remained the same in regards to target demographic being between the ages of 18-24. However, we've seen an increase in the 13-17 and 25-34 age bracket this year. 
* Last year, it was 60% male redditors in the subreddit to a 40% female redditors. This year we've seen an increase in female subredditors for the subreddit at 42.6% while the amount of male redditors has decreased to 56%.
* In regards to the sexuality of the redditors in the subreddit. Predominantly, they affiliated themselves as being straight. While, there has been an increase in all other categories compared to last year.
* It seems like that a 44.4% of the subreddit are still students that are unemployed. But there have been increases to other answers in the category.
* Last year, most of the redditors on the subreddit were predominantly Caucasian / White. This year, Asian or Pacific Islander has come out as the dominant ethnicity in the subreddit.
* Almost 50% of the subredditors on this subreddit are from the USA. Yet, there are only 42 people on this subreddit currently living in South Korea which is an increase from last year.
* Far too many single people on this subreddit. A whooping 80%. To quote a famous song, ""*[Sexy, Free &amp; Single. Im ready too, Bingo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWIkiI_UmeE)*""

---

##KPOP

* Redditors still prefer using streaming services to buy/obtain their K-pop music. However, we've still got folks who like buying digital downloads and physical albums. The good ole' piracy still exists. One thing about this question is that it was a multiple choice answer which means there could be users who could be using a combination of all the answers available.
* Y'all should give your friends or family a [hug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ635vE2RQI)! Why? It seems like a significant amount of redditors got exposed to K-pop via their Friend/Family/Significant Other. Yet, suprisingly we've seen an increase in regards to exposure via just browsing YouTube this year.
* There is a great spread in regards to the how far redditors in the subreddit have been listening to K-pop. However, 16.6% of redditors have been only listening for over a year to two years. This year was the first time we added a decade as an option to listening to K-pop, we got 276 people who have been listening for A LONG TIME.
* Not much has changed in which redditors only know a little it of Korean or don't know any. But, there has been an increase to amount of fluent and moderate knowledge of the Korean language. So yay!
* [BALLOONS FOR EVERYBODY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdTVb64pfMs) It's good to know that we are your number one source for all things K-pop.
* [Y'all are crazy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY) Thanks for visiting the subreddit so much.

##THE QUESTION

* Who reigns supreme for male groups? [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM)
* Who reigns supreme for female groups? [RED VELVET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0)

* [2016 CENSUS /r/kpop FULL RESULTS](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17-HlvG-Z-sMcVWyWVOnkhlIp-ea-LsYkqgtV8QMjo7o/viewanalytics). (NOTE: There are not 11465 responses. It's a bug with the summary page. Not sure how to fix it.)
* We are almost at 60k subscribers for the subreddit. Immense growth in the past year.
* As for the question of who are all your faves, I'll try to release a more sanitized chart that includes responses from the other category.

**Gist of the article:** 
  
- New girl group from 'BlockBerry Creative. **12 members in group, 1st member to release a song in October, 2nd member in November etc.** After this year of solo songs is over, the group will debut as a whole. Songs to range to showcase each individual's talents. 
  
- (Whole of 2nd section appears to be about Dal Shabet?)  
  
- The first member, Heejin had been teased on social media. She has a sense of mystery, yet the dreamlike costumes and colourful backgrounds resembles 'Alice in Wonderland', which gives curiosity about the song. The MV teaser is attracting attention due to the visual that resembles MVs such as BlackPink's Whistle (?*) The agency has placed promotion in a Seoul bus station and has further gained public attention. BlockBerry Officials say the group will have traditional girl group colours but will highly differ from other groups, and an indefinite next year debut. The first song will be released in 5days across various online sites.
  
(?*) = Not 100% sure, mentions BP's Whistle + MV visuals so I'm guessing that's the gist of it.

As you may have noticed, over the last while I haven't been able to consistently work on K-Spotlight. This year has not been kind to me and more bad luck struck me recently. My laptop died ;-; 

With no means of accessing a computer/laptop (there's no way in hell I'm doing all of that formatting on my phone), I will have to put work on this on hiatus. 

I must stress that this isn't the end by any means! I will bring this back as soon as I have a computer, I just don't know when that will be. I love working on the spotlight, it's one of the few good things that has happened for me this last year.

When I do come back, I will make an announcement post first with some new ideas/rules and what not then continue from there.

As our idols say,

I will take this moment to reflect and come back to you with a better image.~

How many promoted songs can you think of that use absolutely 0 English words (including 'baby' and any english words that are written in hangul, like )? 

The only one I can think of for sure is [ITNW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I), and I'm pretty sure WJSN's [Secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJxJ7tSi1w) doesn't have any, but I haven't checked as thoroughly.

I specified PROMOTED songs, because in my experience a lot of b-sides tend to be less English heavy, but if we literally can't think of many promoted songs (I can't!) then B-sides are cool too.

Why do we think this is? Obviously having some English words appeals to English speakers (easier to sing along to/remember bits), but do the random English words appeal to a Korean audience as well?

Maybe groups that are popular or have a generous fan base, but you just like one song from them. Like for instance I LOVE [Vixx - Only U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8LCqaYKluQ) but I don't like anything else by them, so for me that is a one hit wonder.

139,2016-10-3,2016,10,3,20,55n5ds,Why are so many discussion posts being removed?,tasoula,1475492856,"I have noticed that, over the past two weeks or so, a lot of discussion posts are getting deleted by mods because ""this is better suited for /r/kpopslumberparty"" or other various, in my opinion, weak reasons.

/r/kpopslumberparty is dead, folks. Nobody visits that subreddit anymore. I see no problem with people moving discussions onto this reddit. It's not like there's so many discussion posts that the feed is getting clogged up. There are many ""dead hours"" where nothing is posted, so what's the deal with having a few discussion threads?

To everyone that is annoyed by discussion threads: is it that hard to ignore them? Is it that hard to just click ""hide"" and move on with your day? I think I speak for a majority here when I say that people enjoy these discussions, and they keep this reddit from being boring and dead a lot of the time.

I also believe this reddit has had multiple discussions about this in the past, such as in Ask A Mod threads, and most agreed that discussions were fine and shouldn't be removed unless they were a topic that had been discussed very recently (and all of the posts I've seen removed have not fallen under this category). If the majority here are in favor of discussions, why do they keep being removed?",176,286

I was browsing the other day, and saw a vlog posted by KingBach where he reacted to Kpop. 2 other videos followed. 
Another social media celebrity, AmandaCerny, also posted a vlog where she reacted to kpop. 

It seems that the current trend is to ""react"" to kpop, and its starting to get annoying with the fake reactions (Bach looks genuine, or is a good actor)

What are your thoughts?

The videos im refering to (video starts at time before the reaction)

Are there any idols that you feel especially thrive under the idol system? Not necessarily just good artists/performers but those who were 'made for the stage' and/or who deal with the expectations of idol life especially well

I've never seen this discussed here so in light of all the comebacks that have happened and will happen this month so I want to know what reddit's outlook is on streaming music.
We all know that by streaming music through platforms like genie, melon and even youtube we can increase the chances of the groups we love winning award shows and gaining more recognition, so I was wondering how many people actively participate in this culture (is that a good word for it?). I recently bought a melon pass and have streaming music of the groups i like, so i just thought it'd be a good discussion.

Do you stream music? and if so through what platforms

EDIT: this is really just a general discussion on streaming music",24,17

621,2016-10-10,2016,10,10,12,56pzgo,[Discussion] What 20th century throwback concept(s) would you like to see from artists?,griffbendor,1476069499,"SHINee is [completely rocking the 90s throwback concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJua7KEP_oE) and aesthetic, both from a musical and stylistic standpoint (they even went as far as [selling the album on cassette tapes!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/54qhms/shinees_5th_album_1_of_1_will_be_offered_on/?ref=search_posts)), and Lay's [what u need?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCMdn61JMd4) had a similar 90s aesthetic to it, and as someone pointed out the [brief pencil effect](https://youtu.be/uCMdn61JMd4?t=1m2s) was very reminiscent of [Take on Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914). Seeing that SHINee and Lay totally rocked the throwback concepts respectively, what other 20th century throwbacks would you like to see in concepts, either aesthetically, musically, or both?

For example, I would love to see members of SNSD or EXO do a continuation of [this 1920s throwback collaboration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q201GEPYGR8&amp;list=LLtqB2aATyWArykjB_lkv6mg&amp;index=11) that TTS did awhile back. They covered Crazy in Love and it sounded a lot like [Emelie Sande's version for the Great Gatsby soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdU8Uksj8p4). [Key and Tiffany did the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RVQK3mm20Y&amp;list=LLtqB2aATyWArykjB_lkv6mg&amp;index=12) with another song on the Gatsby soundtrack, [Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LziomVuDgik). Personally it would be really cool if a group re-packaged some of their songs in an album and styled them in a vintage way, like the way [Post Modern Jukebox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1QNhIAlP8M) does with a lot of American pop songs. 

So, what kind of throwbacks do you wanna see? I would personally love it if a group did something really 80's, like if they referenced an iconic movie like The Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Alternatively it would be cool to see them go way back to the roaring 20s and do something jazzy but still modern - I personally think that there are a lot of groups that could pull that off.",37,41

644,2016-10-10,2016,10,10,19,56rbeb,Proper Stage Behaviors,thouartthee,1476094646,"So I was re-listening to iKON's Heroes of Remix performances, and I realized something... They're so hype (Looking at you Bobby). Like, they have way too much ""Yeah! Ha! Whoo!"", you know that kind of voices you make during a lit song. Then I was reminded by the fact that the same thing is happening in their concert CD; I even once thought, ""Shut up, Bobby!"" (well, he didn't do it in every song, but somehow he managed to did it in songs that isn't even that much of a hype song). I understand why they're doing that; they're enjoying the stage, and that's good. But when I listen to the audio, I found this kind of behavior quite annoying; it ruins the performance for me. Fortunately, these behaviors are not universal. IIRC, nobody in Block B is that lit when I watched their concert DVD.

Anyway, that was my story. Have you ever had this kind of experience, where the songs are good, but the singers somehow ruin the live performance due to 'improper' stage behaviors (not just audio, but can also be visual)? What do you think about these kind of behaviors? 

As for me, I realized that this is something I can't really criticize/blame (although I just did, didn't I?); I'll probably do the same if I'm too excited during a song. The best I can do is just not listen to the live CD or skip the 'ruined' songs. Regardless, I still think this is something that warrant improvement. I hope they would stop doing that as they mature.

Edit: Hmm... Now I think about it, this is very similar to fanchant. I'm not the type that particularly enjoy listening to fanchant. And I don't go to concert because I personally find them too noisy. Maybe live music is just not for me.",23,5

As always, these are the rules:

**Step 1**: Name a group/artist

**Step 2**: Share 5 songs of theirs we should listen to (links are appreciated!)

**Step 3**: Other optional things to share:

* Why you chose those songs
* A bit about the members
* Brief history of the group / notable events
* Why do you like this group?
* Fanclub name / colour?
* Any fandom in-jokes?
* Any good variety shows/diary shows/interviews/behind-the-scenes/dance rehearsals etc?
* Any live performances worthy of a particular mention?

Post about anyone - from the newest rookies to the biggest groups, somebody somewhere will find it helpful! Post about more than one group if you want, but in separate comments please. Recycling &amp; updating your own comments from past threads (linked below) is fine and using comments from past threads as inspiration is also cool, but don't copy/paste somebody else's without permission. Don't worry about doubling up on a group that's already been done - the more the merrier, and two different perspectives can be interesting! Placeholder comments are handy if you can't post right now - or you need time to condense your encyclopedic knowledge down into comment size ;)

Don't worry about being late to the thread, I know people (including myself) who still refer to past threads from literally years ago so you are never too late to contribute! 

(~~The most groups ever posted about in one of these threads was ~60, if we beat that today i will give you all a cookie~~) COOKIES FOR EVERYBODY!!

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

1132,2016-10-17,2016,10,17,3,57stcx,What songs would you put on a playlist for a rainy day?,griffbendor,1476642733,"So it's been raining pretty hard where I live the past weekend and it'll be raining pretty hard the next couple of days. The usual go-to kpop playlist isn't really cutting it (the summer bops don't really fit the rather gloomy weather), so I've been trying to compile a playlist to use for when it rains here, as it will probably continue to do in the winter. What songs would you put on a playlist for a rainy day? They can be either somewhat sad songs, or like songs that are meant to be cozy when you're staying inside, sipping coffee and doing work.

Here's what I've got so far:

*Sad/Gloomy/Rainy*

[Rain - Taeyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHir_vB1RUI) (obviously couldn't forget this one)

[Love Me The Same - Jessica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qPC3rVhlOw)

[Sailing - SNSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlhR0zBFxZE)

[Into the New World (ballad version of course)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_ZUmMzP5ts)

[Beautiful - Baekhyun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMWXVc3WAYs)

[Awake - Jin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA2ukR269NY)

[Sing For You - EXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqaSboKBIuA)

[Not Yet - Orange Caramel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BduGwidWFP0)

[Autumn Leaves - BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-DdQUszwoc)

*Comfy/Cozy*

[Don't Let Me Go - SHINee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoB8O2G0QyI)

[Tornado - 4Ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCqUQxikvuI)

[Dream - Baekhyun and Suzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfYgbFBFe1E)

[Goodbye - SNSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO_1yKHIDdo)

[Wait a Minute - SNSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRR629BS-oE)

[Coffee - BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN7evWGj68)



EDIT: Thank you all for the suggestions! I'm compiling a playlist of all your suggestions right now and have been listening to the first twenty or so seconds of each song -- they're all really mellow and relaxing for today, since I'm drenched in rain and it's really dark outside.

## GROWTH

It's been two weeks since we made a moderator post in regards to the subreddit and that was the [results of the 2016 census.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/55g79h/reddit_kpop_census_2016_results/) Since then, we've reached over [60,000 subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/563ook/meta_60000_subscribers/) which is freaking awesome. As of the time this post is being written, we are getting close to reaching 61,000 subscribers. As a subscriber of the subreddit, you can always see the [traffic stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/about/traffic/) of /r/kpop.

---

## MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING RULE

Back in August when we announced the [new moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4x91fp/subreddit_update_new_mods_and_a_rule_change/), we also conducted polls in regards to changing a particular rule:

&gt; The only music show performances that can be posted outside of the compilation thread are comeback/debut stages, goodbye stages, special stages, and winner videos.

Here are the results of the strawpolls and internal moderator polling for the following questions:

* Weekly music shows (specifically the ones listed on the sidebar) will now have AutoModerator generated discussion threads that will be posted on the start time of the show. The discussion thread will also act as the compilation thread for the weekly music show. (**MODERATOR RULING: SPLIT VOTE / SUBREDDIT RULING BASED ON [POLL RESULTS](http://www.strawpoll.me/10968826/r): YES** )

* Should every single performance by an artist / group during their comeback / debut stage be posted as individual submission links? (**MODERATOR RULING: NO / SUBREDDIT RULING BASED ON [POLL RESULTS](http://www.strawpoll.me/10968833/r): NO** )

* Change how winners for weekly music shows are announced on the subreddit. The spoiler tag does not work for people who use mobile apps or disable the subreddit theme. Make the submission title vague in regards to the winner as an example ""Today's Winner for Mnet M! Countdown (160811)"".  (**MODERATOR RULING: ""Do not announce winner as part of the submission title."" / SUBREDDIT RULING BASED ON [POLL RESULTS](https://www.strawpoll.me/10968841/r): ""Do not announce winner as part of the submission title.""** )

In light of these results, the following rule will now be changed.

**OLD**

&gt; The only music show performances that can be posted outside of the compilation thread are comeback/debut stages, goodbye stages, special stages, and winner videos

**NEW**

&gt; Music show performances are now restricted to the discussion thread generated by AutoModerator. Music show winners will now also be announced in the discussion thread as well.

The following rule change now goes into effect from here on out. We will make modifications based on how it is from week to week. 

The music shows that will have AutoModerator generated discussion threads will be: 

* MBC !  (Music Core)
* KBS2  (Music Bank)
* SBS  (Inkigayo)
* MBC MUSIC !  (Show! Champion)
* MNET  (M Countdown)
* SBS MTV  (The Show)

## NEW THINGS FOR THE SUBREDDIT

We are going to introduce something new to the subreddit. We will now have a monthly town hall held on the first of every single month. Be on the look out for the first edition held on November 1st. The town hall's main purpose is to be a thread in which people can discuss concerns about moderating and other things pertaining to the subreddit. Any concerns that you might have in regards to the state of the subreddit must be posted in the current month's town hall post, even if it's in the middle of the month. If it requires immediate attention, [message moderators directly via modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop)

Next on the docket will be the [introduction of stale topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/stale-topics). The following idea is something we've seen work in action on /r/popheads and /r/hiphopheads. Shoutouts to those wonderful subs.

As the subscriber count of the subreddit has grown over the past year, we've gotten to the point in which we've noticed repetitive topics that don't provide much discourse and are very simple to the point they are just questions that could be more suitable for /r/kpophelp.

Stale topics will encompass discussions and submissions. Here is the current list:

###Banned Topics

#### Discussions

- What's your unpopular k-pop opinion?

- Questions about songs that don't sound like typical hits 

- Questions about something being overrated or underrated 

-  What is your/the sub's opinion of [INSERT ARTIST HERE]?

-  Let's make a list of songs about [INSERT TOPIC HERE]!

- ""What song do you like by an artist that you hate"" and vice versa

- Threads designed to bash an artist or their fanbase

- What's your favorite B-side / non-title track that should have been promoted? (Perhaps allow this discussion twice a year?)

- ""If you could remove any member from this group"" or ""If you could pick any idols to form your own supergroup""

- Who do you want to comeback?

- Questions about group dynamics as to when they should've disbanded or added a new member.

- Questions without initial discussion by submitter


####Submissions

- Artist music video view count updates (Still permitted are certain music video accomplishments.)

- Artist real-time all kills (Still permitted as submissions are all kills, certified all kills and perfect all kills.)

The last two are recent submission topics that we've been talking about extensively as a moderator group in terms of the value it brings as a submission. It's pretty simple in terms of artist music video view count updates. It's just a number and it's rather boring if you post every single milestone that happens. We will only allow certain music video accomplishments.

Now, the final banned submission topic is artist real-time all kills. For those uninformed and don't know what this is, all kills revolve around a single's performance on Korean music charts. One can track them via [INSTIZ iChart.](http://www.instiz.net/bbs/list.php?id=spage&amp;no=8) The music charts that matter are MelOn, Genie, Mnet, Bugs and Soribada. There are others which are Olleh, Daum, Naver, Monkey3 and Cyworld. But the king of all charts is MelOn.

* Real-time All Kill is when a song gets #1 on real-time (hourly) charts.
* All Kill is when a song is #1 on all possible daily music charts.
* Certified All Kill (INSTIZ) is #1 on all real-time charts and daily charts. (Example: [Suzy and Baekhyun getting a certified all kill](https://i.imgur.com/TEIEeMO.png))
* Perfect All Kill (INSTIZ) is #1 on all real-time charts, all daily charts and Instiz weekly chart. (Example: [Simon D One, G2, and Bewhy getting a PAK](http://i.imgur.com/w7rLMkb.jpg))

As you can see, real-time all kills are fairly common and an artist can get them at any time. They frequently occur for new releases due to the initial surge of interest. Once that interest has waned, they will slowly fall off the real-time charts.

We would really like to get feedback on stale topics.

Back then, having such an abnormally large group (with the exception of SNSD, SuJu) was something that was strayed away from, but it seems as though after EXO made it big, other companies wanted to do the same. I feel like it'd be much easier to promote individual members when the group is smaller (six and below), but that's my personal opinion. Other than getting as many trainees to debut all at once would be one plausible reason as to why companies would want larger groups, I can't think of any other reason.",145,95

Staff: There will be a press conference on October 27th, and the new album will be released afterwards.


**Yixing/ Lay: Yup,  I want to showcase a sexy and gentleman in this album so the songs are mainly love songs. And most importantly, there is a song which is written for the fans in the album. I believe that they will definitely like it.**

I know quite a few people who are already gugudan/WJSN/DIA/Pledis Girlz fans, but it doesn't seem like we have that many on the sub. 

For me, I'm pretty dedicated to following each of the girls in their own groups (and Sohye's future award-winning acting career) because I just don't think it's right to bash the girls/their groups for their company's decisions. Plus, it's cool to see and support the other PD101 girls who didn't end up making it (Kim Nayoung/KiHeehyun)

 
I know some people on this sub/knetizens like to write off the other groups as flops. I think it's pretty unfair to compare IOI's absurd and massive popularity as a cultural phenomenon to the other groups who are all doing pretty well for rookies. For example, gugudan sold over 20k for their debut album which is on par with groups like OMG, WJSN is rising with Chengxiao and Yeonjung, DIA went from super nugu to tripling their sales with help from Chaeyeon and Heehyun. Both DIA and WJSN had top 30 melon debuts despite barely charting/not charting at all before PD101/IOI, and gugudan debuted top 20. And Pledis is actually doing a great job of hyping the girls up predebut with their concert series. 

Also hype for Somi/Chungha/Fantagio girl group's imminent debut!


So what are your thoughts?

1478,2016-10-21,2016,10,21,4,58iu8t,"[Discussion] Does your K-pop bias have a reputation or ""image"" to uphold?",OhHenners,1476991804,"Many groups in K-pop, especially those of the female variety, face immense pressure to maintain a cute and innocent image. It's not unusual for a 20-something idol to reveal that she or he has limited experience when it comes to dating and romance. Their inexperience may be the result of crazy busy schedules and/or their agency's so-called dating bans, but public scrutiny is arguably the chief reason why idols are shy about disclosing their personal relationships.

But this topic isn't about whom our faves may or may not be locking lips with.

This topic is really about your bias' public image. **Is he or she very reserved, in order to avoid any unnecessary hate or drama? Or perhaps she or he dgaf what people think?**

I believe Suho is one of those idols who is very careful about everything he says and does. I remember him saying once (I can't find the video/article T__T) that he tries to be composed and poised in public because of his job as EXO's leader. People tend to say that he is very awkward and boring, but I think he makes a conscious effort to be stable and serious for his members' sake. That makes me respect him as a leader.

On the other hand, [Sooyoung clearly gives](https://youtu.be/QDAIPrtSiGA?t=17m7s) [absolutely no shits](https://youtu.be/u_XSoLkyilE?t=32s) about her image, and that's why I love her.

I didn't like how Korean sounded, then eventually I started to like it, then love the language ~ it's beautiful.  As for the song, I didn't like it very much and the music video was cool except for some weird-looking outfits here and there (I actually was distracted from Top because I was cringing so hard at what he was wearing that I didn't even notice his gorgeousness lol). Eventually the song grew on me as I continually listened to it even more, which I can't really explain because I was only relistening to it because I liked certain parts of it~eh, the song's decent.  Second group I discovered was Block B and they were my faves for a long time, especially Zico(his parts in the songs are awesome and so are his mixtapes) :) ",66,7

OP: Not sure if this is allowed, but we are currently working on a group project for my KPOP class in uni.

1549,2016-10-22,2016,10,22,3,58oohl,When Bad Management Happens to Good Artists,mango_script,1477073364,"Unless you're a hardcore stan of a management company(s), I'm sure everyone here knows what I'm taking about. I'm curious to hear what artists people think have been grossly mismanaged and where you think they would thrive. I'm going to have to say Ailee and Lee Hi. These two are my R.O.D. female soloists. I can't get enough of their voices. Ailee, for me, is the best vocalist on the scene and Lee Hi's tone is so unique and refreshing, I could spot her voice from a record playing across the room. They're also being flagrantly mismanaged by piss poor companies who couldn't tell a comeback from a camel's ass, pardon my French.

Ailee's music frequently runs towards generic power ballads; they're really stifling her in terms of musical genres. If there was someone I wanted to *not* stay in their genre lane, it'd be her. I wish they'd give her less Aretha Franklin/Adele and more Ariana Grande/Jessie J. Less belting and more body rolls, please and thanks. Lee Hi is also being type-casted, genre wise. Her music seems far older than she is. I still can't get over her last full album--""Rose"" in particularly; it was full of these Adele-light somber lamentations that I half wondered if the tracks had been meant for Gummy.

I would send both of them over to Jay Park's company AOMG. I know, I know, neither does hip hop, but I feel like Jay Park allows his artists to breathe *and* promote consistently. YGE artists are (supposedly) given creative license, but then they don't promote so what's the point of flaunting the fact that you have carte blanche to produce whatever the fuck you want if we only see you during leap years? Ailee's company just keeps shoving mellow songs and power ballads on her (though ""Home"" is my current jam even though I feel like it falls flat in some places). Also, I feel like both Ailee and Lee HI would mesh well with his brand of R&amp;B/hip hop.",177,93

1640,2016-10-23,2016,10,23,15,58xf9d,Fanaccount of SHINee's Music Core recording (x-posted in /r/SHINee),L-autrichienne,1477203825,"So yesterdays music core was wonderful. It was so so great.

On Friday I finished work (and last week/this upcoming week are the two hardest ones at my job because of the dreaded open classes) and I jetted out of there, Everything worked out really nicely in terms of transfers and such and I ended up arriving at Digital Media City at 4:45 BEFORE the notice went up. So when I got there all the girls that had been at KBS were still there stalking the tree, refreshing their phones, eyeing the line girls. 10 minutes later the notice went up. We had been crowding around this one phone pole but they put it up on a different pole so we moved like a school of tuna towards it. There were muggles caught in the fray... I hope they survived.

Even though all of my friends were there, and we all sent our pics at the same time (4:55) we had wildly different numbers, from 73 (me) to 186. Its really just dependent on luck and I like to think that my new phone is a very aggressive little beastie.

Anyhow no night check in, just head home and be back at 5:20 am. So we get back the next morning, only the 7/11 and the mandu place are open. I grab a warm soy milk because I've recently discovered that stuff is the bomb and go wait for line to start. There are a lot of us. A LOT. Like weeeeeelllll over the 350 allotment (not that this is new, but yesterday seemed even more than usual). 

The SM check wasn't supposed to start until 7 am but the Doll supporter showed up at around 6 am, she must have talked to the line girls and found out the numbers. We get sorted and there are at least 300 S1 alone. It was insane, that line just never stopped coming. It was endless. Civilizations rose and fell in the time it took for that entire line to pass by me, at the beginning of the lowly S2 line. I was not exactly optimistic.

But then the Doll supporter returned and started to pull us in too. I was seated (in an actual seat) a bit to the left of seating area but close to the stairs. We started going in at like 8:40 and the recording was at 9:20 I think. They spent that time tryign to weasel as many Shawols as humanly possible in there. They were on stairs, sitting in the walk areas, standing at the back, standing behind the console, they were stuffed in the pit like sardines. I'd say they got about 700-800 of us in. I know there were still girls outside though, but they were bringing people in even after the rehearsal run. Bless MBC staff for that. 

When we got in there they were still setting up the stage. It was such a cute stage as you guys would have seen, but they brought out the ""menu"" board with their names and birthdays and we were all like ""awwwwww huh?"". There were lots of little whispers around cause they had fucked up Taemin and Minho's birthdays. No one said anything though.

Finally SHINee came out. They were in good spirits immediately and were waving and chatting, they also thought the stage was really cute so they started wandering around looking at it. Taemin quickly went over the menu board and started making funny honking sounds to get the others attention. They were so amused by the mistake They kept saying how Jinki was the most expensive and that Taem was pricier than he should be.

PD called for standby and they were instant professionals again. Except not, cause it was a rehearsal. And they are never fully professional during rehearsals. Jonghyun is always a lazy duck bless him but yesterday while the dance moves were weaker than normal the cute factor was off the fucking charts holy hell. Just left and right stupid and smiles and aegyo and god bless. He was so damn bouncy. I was dying.  The others were in similar moods too. Just being silly and ridiculous for the cameras and for us. Thats the best part of the rehearsal. They're showing off for us. During the normal takes they ham it up for the camera obviously but for the rehearsal, for that one take, they're directing all of their love and attention to us in the audience. They're always cute in ways they can't be for the camera because it usually fucks up the dance somehow or it looks weird when captured by the camera.

After the rehearsal, the staff rushed onto the stage and the main PD girl was showing the construction guys what was wrong on the board. They apologized, which was really unnecessary, shit happens. It made for funny moments with SHINee and it meant they were on stage longer. Onew said they should just slap a sticker over those two and have it say Sold Out. But the construction guys fixed it right on teh stage and you can't tell it was cut up at all in the broadcast so props to them. The PD girl was really embarrassed and ran off stage. We clapped for her and made reassuring noises. 

SHINee came back after a brief break behind the wall where I think it was Key was making really strange noises, but it might have been Taem too cause that kid can do really bizarre shit to his voice when he is being weird.  They did a really good take, one where our fanchants were perfect (Shawols tend to miss the first time we say Jonghyun's name, its right after the Korean parts in Key's rap so we are like breathing and dealing with Jonghyun's cute and forget to say his name). 

*side note: 10f1 fanchants are super hard. You have to know exactly who is singing next and while I remember it fine now at first it was like I literally just had to memorize the order. Taemin, Minho, Jonghyun, Minho, Key, Jinki, Jinki, Key, Taemin, Jonghyun. Also Key's Korean is a bitch to say too

After that take Onew bent down to tie his shoes or fuck with his socks one of those. He took ages and when he looked up he was teh only one up there. Cue awwwwwwwww. He then slowly shuffled off stage. He was being very very deliberately cute acting all confused and old man. Taemin was having lots of of fun playing with his jacket fringe. Minho also had fun with his yellow sunglasses and was being a ham left and right. Key spent some time pretending to take orders on the set.

They were looking at the actual food sign and Jinki was matching them up to their food. He said Jonghyun was a cupcake (100% true) he was a hotdog, Minho was french fries, Taem was a burger (Taemin said burger in the silliest way too christ) and Key threw in that he was definitely soda then. They had us howling.

After they finished the third take Jonghyun ran off stage but quickly came back with his phone. You are absolutely not allowed to take pics in the studios... unless you are SHINee clearly. He took multiple ones from different angles trying to get us all in. They were so dazzled by how many of us there were that day and how pretty our ""chicken feet"" were (referring to the lightstick between each finger set up we often do). Jonghyun also took some pics of the stage. They all really liked it. And I was impressed too, SM usually doesn't do much for stages after the first week. They thanked us multiple times and just kept stopping and smiling at us. I was at the far left so quite near the doors to the backstage and could see them going back there. Minho and Jonghyun both stopped and waved and smiled hugely at us. 

After this we all ran outside and got in our lines to get our fancards signed and for the first 200 S2, to get the [poster](http://socdn.smtown.com/upload/starhome/board/images/2016/10/06/p1aubs9fnc1824u1vq69uott2b6.jpg). 

For no particular reason Shawols just seemed to be milling around more yesterday. And so I did as well, got to see BTS full core fandom that was interesting. They had their lines really neatly numbered so it was easy to gauge how many there were... also lots of fishnets in that line. Like more fishnets in the BTS line than I've ever seen in Korea before. It was an odd observation.

All in all it was an excellent final recording. Since they are in Busan today for the One Asia festival they did a post recording last week for today's Inkigayo and it had a minuscule allotment (like 30). SHINee were sweet and perfect as usual and I'm so happy Jinki uploaded Jonghyun's picture of us. 

Ooh and also there were SO MANY FANBOYS yesterday. Like at least 20 or so. Soooo many!!

*psst if you're a Shawol head over to /r/SHINee we are trying to finally make that place happen and so far its going really well!*",17,88

(If you haven't then that's amazing!) and I know this question might sound confusing so lemme kinda clear it up by giving an example. Like for me if C-Clown would've never broken up I feel like Rome would've eventually left the group. Since the disbandment he's veered so far off what C-Clown could've provided him sound wise and image wise and he even showed signs of that towards the end of C-Clown's career. So if they would've continued he would have definitely left the group. What about you guys? What do you think would've happened to your group?,38,32

1683,2016-10-24,2016,10,24,4,5906wo,Busan One Asia Festival (BOF) Closing Performance - Dream Concert recap,OhHenners,1477250229,"Tonight's Dream Concert officially closed the Busan One Asia Festival. It was held at the Asiad Main Stadium from 7 to about 9:50 p.m. It was my first K-pop concert (and second concert overall), so I was very excited. I thought the tickets were all sold out, but I managed to find one online at the last minute. The website I used has some pretty negative reviews, but I took a chance, and it ultimately paid off.

The venue was easy to find. From the metro station I just followed the crowd of screaming teen girls. There were stalls and vendors outside of the stadium. They sold all kinds of Korean street food and K-pop merchandise. I saw calendars, photo cards, twinkling headbands, pillows and lightsticks. There was merch for artists who weren't even performing tonight. I was tempted to drop a few thousand won on a SoShi desk calendar, but I resisted and bought a French fry-encrusted corn dog instead because I was hungry. A vendor near the entrance sold albums. I saw SHINee's newest one. He even had the cassette tape version.

I saw quite a few foreigners at the concert, but the audience consisted mostly of girls in their teens and 20s. My seat was on the ground floor, but it was far from the stage. All the performers looked like they were two inches tall from where I was sitting. Two giant screens on either side of the stage helped everyone get a better view of the artists. The stadium's roof was closed, but it was still chilly in there. A lot of people had purchased blankets outside, so they were fine, but some of the idols on stage wore shorts and short-sleeved tops. I felt bad for them.

AOA's Seolhyun came out about 10 minutes before the live show and gave a short introduction. She was wearing her lifeguard outfit from Good Luck. An English-subbed video montage of this year's festival played after she finished speaking. There were clips from the Opening Performance at the beginning of the month, so we got to see IOI, SNSD, T-ARA, Girl's Day, Sechs Kies and Psy. People sang along to Gee and Roly Poly. There was also another performance clip with Gummy, Lyn, U-KISS and Secret's Jieun. SHINee's Minho did some kind of acting workshop, too, so he was on the screen for like, two seconds. There tons of cheers for him, though.

The Inkigayo hosts walked out after the montage. Jeongyeon was dressed in black. She got some loud cheers, but the loudest cheers were for Kim Minseok, the male host. Some of the people in the audience didn't know that the concert was sponsored by SBS, so they were surprised to see the Inki hosts. According to Soompi, the entire show will be broadcast next Sunday as an Inkigayo special. They did a roll call of all the artists in attendance. In my section of the stadium, the boy groups got the most screams and applause, but TWICE and Red Velvet were popular, too. AOA got very few cheers when they were called. Most of the groups got ""WHOO!"" AOA barely got a ""Whoo ... "" and people laughed after realizing that. Rude! TWICE and BaekXiuChen were there, but there were no teasers or additional information about their respective comebacks.

* MIXX, SF9, Big Brain, NC.A, HALO and KNK were the first to perform. NC.A and Big Brain sang slower, ballad-like songs. In my opinion NC.A seemed kind of lonely on stage, since it was so big. Then again, maybe she wanted to convey the emotions in the song. The audience didn't clap very much when SF9 came on stage (probably because they're still a new group), but a lot of folks seemed to enjoy their song.

* I was glad to see people be excited for GFriend. The audience actually sang along to Me Gustas Tu. The girls wore skirts and pastel sweater vests. I liked how they didn't just walk to a new position; they kind of double-timed across the stage. Starting with GFriend, every group got to sing two songs (the exception was EXO BXC).

* GFriend and pretty much every group after them got cheers and loud applause when they performed. I didn't know MONSTA X was so popular. The stage had blue lights for their powerful and high-energy performance of Fighter. Shownu wore a sleeveless black top &lt;3 Their second song was All In.

* There were massive cheers for Red Velvet all throughout their songs. Yeri was absent today. The girls wore white long-sleeved shirts that had thin, horizontal red stripes on them. Wendy had pigtails. They sang Russian Roulette and Dumb Dumb. I can't get enough of the rap.

* TWICE did Cheer Up first and then Like OOH-AHH. They looked happy, energetic and very pretty. The audience shouted, ""SHY! SHY! SHY!"" when it was Sana's part. Several of the performances had fire, smoke and fireworks, but the fireworks for TWICE's performance were among the biggest and brightest of the night.

* MAMAMOO sang New York and You're the Best. They sounded great and looked great. They wore shimmery tops. Solar's was pink. It sounded like the audience enjoyed You're the Best more than New York. I wasn't into New York when I first heard it, but I kind of like it now.

* Baekhyun, Xiumin and Chen wore light gray suits and pink dress shirts. They sang their OST song from Baekhyun's drama. They greeted the audience afterward and quickly left the stage. Baek wore glasses today. A girl who was sitting in the row behind me literally cried.

* The audience was really into GOT7's Hard Carry. I enjoyed this song, too. I wasn't a fan of it when I watched the MV, but it's better when it's live. Jinyoung looked handsome when they greeted the audience. Their second song was Fly.

* I didn't recognize BTOB's first song, but I think it was also called Fly? They wore black outfits. They performed Beep Beep afterward.

* Apink did their newest song and LUV. LUV had a pink carousel backdrop. They held their mics out to the audience and had them sing the ""L-O-V-E LOVE"" part. A lot of girls got out of their seats and moved around so that they could get closer to the stage.

* BTS was up next. I love watching them perform; they're always so professional and in-sync with each other. They got the loudest cheers and applause of the night. Their first song was Blood, Sweat and Tears, and their second one was Fire. The stage was illuminated with burning red flames.

* I expected AOA to get more cheers than they did. When they walked around and talked to the audience, it seemed like they didn't get many responses. I loved their performance, however. Hyejeong, Yuna and Jimin were stunning. They did Good Luck and Heart Attack.

* INFINITE performed The Eye and Bad. They gave a shout-out to all the Inspirits, who had their own section on the upper half of the stadium. The glow of their lightsticks looked really impressive. Sungjong was still blond. 

* The hosts came out one more time and said their goodbyes. SHINee closed the show with Prism and 1 of 1. It was my first time hearing Prism, and I liked it a lot. Shawols also had a section on the upper level of the stadium. The crowd figuratively lost their shit when Key winked at them. The fireworks after their songs were really spectacular.

When I was outside after the concert, I suddenly saw a huge crowd of people running. I heard a girl say something about SHINee, so I followed them. I saw a black van driving away from the stadium. I couldn't see into the vehicle, but a bunch of fans were standing around and screaming their heads off. A man in a neon yellow vest kept blowing his whistle and tried to hold everyone back. One girl tried to plead with the officer. She was all like, ""*Ahjussssssi!*"" But he was not having it. The car's window came down for a second, and everyone screamed again.

The Dream Concert was a lot of fun! It's so different from watching performances on my computer. I'm glad I went because I got to be in the company of other fans. If you ever get the chance to attend a K-pop concert, I highly recommend going to it.",5,41

Half of my biases happen to be rappers. I have noticed that the current trend in K-Pop is to have a rap break in every song and because it's obligatory, it feels less special. For example, I don't think Mamamoo's [Words Don't Come Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc2bfEYNY7w) needs a rap. It's a ballad and should be performed as such. Plus, [Moonbyul has a wonderful alto voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcCag8cNzfI) and she should utilizie it more. On the flip side, I prefer the MV version of [Come Back Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLbfv-AAyvQ) rather than the CD version because the MV has CL's rap. So then an alternative question can be, **has rap made a song for you and which was it?**",198,74

1834,2016-10-25,2016,10,25,13,599aqq,[Discussion] Do you think individual/multiple concepts for a group's comeback leads to their huge successes? Why does it work for some groups and not others?,griffbendor,1477370962,"**(Note: Large block of text ahead. If you don't want to read it all there'll be a TL:DR at the bottom.)**

I've been trying to figure out just what it is about TWICE exactly that has made them so popular and successful, and while there's obviously multiple reasons for that, I think I found a good part of the formula to their's (and any) group: individual and multiple concepts.

The idea of individual/multiple concepts is not entirely new. In fact, I think it's the reason why two videos in particular are so popular, for similar but different reasons: [I Got A Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E) and [Dope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM). With IGAB, SNSD really took the whole idea of multiple concepts to a whole new level. Besides the music basically having multiple different sections that are all so unique mashed together (hell, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Got_a_Boy_(song) lists it under six different genres), the entire MV is one giant multiconcept, from sleepover party to denim everything to the streetwear dancebreak and then suddenly pink hair motown. It's jarring at first, sure, but just look at how crazy successful SNSD was that year: multiple YouTube kpop records, Youtube Video of the Year, TIME even listed it on their list for Top 10 Songs of the Year. There are a variety of reasons for that success, but I think part of it was because of the multiple concepts: appeal of *distinct and recognizable* individual members (the styling and coloring for example--I just noticed almost all the members change their hair color/style at least once in the video) and portions of the song is what made it so popular, especially (in my opinion) internationally, where individuality is seen as a huge positive trait. Plus, the multiple concepts idea was so jarring that almost everyone had a different opinion about it, generating even more buzz (more on that later).

With BTS, Dope follows the same formula, but a bit differently. Rather than multiple concepts, the group does individual concepts, where there's a focus on each member in their respective concept (most memorable for me was Doctor Jin, Conan Tae, and Racer J-hope). The music doesn't jump around genres, but there's still a sense of individuality to each member's concept, and each member has his own appeal that draws you in-- or perhaps it doesn't (more on that later). Again, I think this individuality is part of the reason the MV blew up and got so popular (it, along with IGAB, broke 100M views).

With TWICE, they've repurposed the individual/multiple concept idea that IGAB and Dope established. With Like OOH-AHH, there were not only multiple concepts that the set switches to, but each member has their own individual concept (the most distinct for me being Sana's cheerleader styling and Mina's dancer/performer styling. Not only that, but there are multiple concepts: zombie apocalypse, empty warehouse, rooptop hangout, etc. They streamlined this with Cheer Up; every member got an individual film or TV show, distinct but recognizable enough on their own, but multiple members appear within the individual concepts. And with TT, this becomes even more obvious: just looking at the Reddit comments a good portion of them were all about Dahyun's bunny outfit, Tzuyu looking beautiful in that makeup, and pirate Mina with the gun. And yet every member still got a lot of attention; although there were some fan favorites like Dahyun and Mina, I saw discussion about each member's concept. The fact that so much of the discussion is centered around the concept for each girl is what really stood out to me this time, and I think this is one of the reasons why TWICE has gotten so popular: they've gotten really good at using the multi/individual concept for each comeback.

**TL:DR** Part of the reason why I think TWICE's success is so massive is because they've taken the basic groundwork SNSD and BTS have laid down and combined them into one idea, which they've used every time since (and have gotten even more popular every time). And I think it's really brilliant that they've done this so exceptionally. All that said however; if it works so well for SNSD, BTS, and TWICE, why aren't other groups doing this more (or, more generally, why does it work for some groups and not others)? And for the groups it did work so well for, why did BTS and SNSD (and other groups I'm probably forgetting) never really capitalize on it again like TWICE has?

There's no separation of debut/comeback/special/goodbye stages and there's hardly ever any YouTube links (navercast?...um no thanks, I can't stream that on Xbox). I'm confidently complaining here, because I know others have expressed their frustrations in comments, but the issue hardly gets addressed.

""I worry about the girls of Girls Generation themselves. I worry about Yoona, about Yuri, and most of all about my nephews favorite Seohyun. This may be the most important issue of all, and whenever I see them on stage I think it: do they know how they are being consumed? Do they know how they are viewed and felt by men? If they do know, is that what they really want? By any chance, do they suffer from their own wishes and their companys clashing?

People will ask why I worry about them. After all, they are legal adults. Despite that however, the system they operate in is far more powerful. And against the argument that they are in the music industry  just the product of a capitalist society  and that its their choice, I still frequently pause to think if its not an affront to human dignity.""

Thoughts? Keep in mind this is not about SNSD. Rather, it is about the whole kpop system and it's implications.",62,46

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

2156,2016-10-29,2016,10,29,14,59z6fi,[Update] Survey results on the use of English in KPOP,humdrummm,1477720364,"Hi all,

Last week, I asked you guys for help on answering a [survey on the use of English in KPOP](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/58m5vq/please_help_us_for_a_group_project_exploring_the/). As promised, I will be sharing the results with you!

In summary, it seems like most already-fans of KPOP don't really care about English usage that much; it seems to matter more with potential fans (i.e. some people were saying that they're more likely to show someone a song if it has good english in it). For you KPOP fans, it seems that lyrics have very little to do with it in terms of what's the most important aspect of KPOP--the answers with the most responses is either the beat or the performance (surprisingly, not a lot of answers for visuals!)

Interestingly, people are saying that good English in songs doesn't really matter that much but in the secondary questions, some people are saying that it *might* make them like an artist more if they do have good English in their songs (some reasons stated: because it shows that the artist put in effort, attests to their quality, or just relating in general). Conversely, it won't make people dislike a group if a song has bad English, but it may hinder them from listening to that song again. Some people said that bad English may make a song more memorable, though!

In terms of success in the West, people still think that KPOP will be a niche market. Yes, English is necessary, but it doesn't seem to be the key to success (although it is helpful in many other aspects), which is also what my group will be arguing.

However, people still want KPOP groups to continue the use of English in their naming practices and in their songs, so that the groups are more accessible when searching them up and so they can have something to sing along to.

Okay, that was long! Here are the links to the full results (I did 2 identical surveys, both will only have 100 responses each). Thank you so much again for all your help and support--it helped our research/project in a really big way!

2199,2016-10-30,2016,10,30,13,5a4i6r,[Fan Account] CL HELLO BI+CHES TOUR - NYC,apreche,1477801632,"People asked me to write about my experience at the show tonight, so I will. Obviously - wall of text.

You just have to be aware of a few things. I am a 34-year old white dude, who mostly only goes to metal shows. It was the first time I have ever been to a pop concert in my life. My opinion clearly does not represent the majority of the fan demographic. I had a general admission floor ticket, so I can't tell you anything about the VIP experience. Lastly, my memory is not the greatest. Feel free to ask questions in the comments, but I just got home and can't even remember the entire set list. Sorry in advance if I can't answer everything accurately.


I live in NYC. Doors open at 7:30 with the show starting at 8:30. I take the subway and arrive around 6:15-6:30. I was planning to get some food before heading in, but I check out the line first. The line only looks like it's a few hundred people, but it was deceptive because the VIPs were lined up in one direction and everyone else in another direction. The ballroom only holds a couple thousand. I wasn't that hungry, and it wasn't that cold out, so I get in line.


While waiting in line some staff come around checking tickets and giving out colored wristbands according to what kind of ticket you have. I'm not sure if these wristbands mattered. Nobody checked mine at any point. The venue staff still scanned the barcode on my ticket before they let me inside. Eventually around 8:10-8:20 we are inside. I stand in the way back on the left. There are people with VIP and Superior tickets in front of us GA people, so waiting in line didn't really matter. The room isn't that big, and even at just 5'11"", I'm taller than most of the crowd. I'm good. 


On stage there is the typical staircase in the center that CL likes. On the left is a drum set, on the right a bunch of keyboards. A moderate lighting setup as well. At the top of the stairs is a large projection screen. They are playing a loop of 2NE1 music videos. People are cheering and singing along. Thanks to it looping, I heard the song ""Come Back Home"" at least three times tonight


At around 8:45 the show actually starts. Only slightly behind schedule. There's a short intro video showing CLs life and career advancing. Baby CL so cute! Then CL comes out to 2NE1 - Fire. She's wearing a shiny black leather trench coat kinda thing. This whole first part of the show is like 2NE1's greatest hits. She actually sings a lot of songs. It's almost like a medley since some songs are not performed in full, but every song gets at least 1 full verse, usually more. I was very surprised that she did a large production for Scream, one of my favs. I'm pretty sure she performed the entire thing. She does so many songs here, I can't think of a significant one that was left out. Maybe ""Ugly"" got skipped? She even sang older songs like ""Do You Love Me"" It was the longest segment of the show.


After all those 2NE1 songs are over, she leaves to take a break. They fill the break time with some combination of videos, the live musicians, and dancers performing. During one of the breaks they play a Hello Bitches music video that I have never seen before in my life. I think they may have made it just for this concert. It had a very high production value. When she comes back, it's a costume change. She comes back wearing a white-ish dress. It's like something a bridesmaid would wear at a wedding. Obviously it is time for the ballad-ish songs. She kicked it off with Lonely, and followed with a few more. 


The show is going to end at 10 and it's around 9:30, so there can't be much more left. Just before CL comes back, the dance crew runs on stage with the flags, so we all know what that means. She's now wearing a dress made out of dark green military camo and she's asking where the GZB's are at. They're right here! The crowd gets more hype than they have been all night. This is where she brings out the Baddest Female, Dr. Pepper, MTBD, and such. I'm glad I'm not the only one who likes MTBD so much. I feel like that song is underappreciated. Remember on Roommate when Bom blasted that song throughout the entire house? Those were good days.


Anyway, she takes one more break. During that break we get a video. It's a behind the scenes video of her preparing for the concert. Practicing with the band and the dancers. Figuring out the stage direction. It wasn't particularly exciting. Just something to fill the time. It would have been more interesting if it had an interview segment or something. It was just watching her at work. That's much more interesting than watching me at work, but you're still not missing much. 


I expected another costume change when she came back, but not this time. Still the same camo thing. It's time to get Lifted. This studio recording of this song doesn't do anything for me, but it's much more powerful when performed live for some reason. Dirty Vibe I think comes next, which was actually way fun. The show ends at almost exactly 10 with Hello Bitches. She thanks everyone, takes a bow, and they roll some credits on the screen.


I remember reading online that Dara was supposed to be in the show. She wasn't. Just as I was thinking about that and turning around to head out, a bunch of screaming fangirls squish me. Dara was watching from the balcony next to me. Apparently that was the area a bunch of Korean fans/friends were sitting in. Everyone is trying to get pics, high five her, and such. I never imagined I would want Dara to go away. Gladly, she ran away after a couple minutes, and I escaped the mob.


Ok, so some other things. The merchandise. I looked at it from far away. I don't know what it cost. I assume it was overpriced. I didn't get closer to find out. Most of it looked like just black t-shirts that say HELLO BI+CHES on them. It didn't look like they put a lot of effort into making anything creative to sell. At the start, they did hand out some tiny red glow sticks and balloons, but I didn't take them.


I wish I would have bought a ticket up in the seating area. It was further away, but I think I could have enjoyed the show more. Usually at a concert I'm only concerned with hearing, not seeing. But I guess at KPop show, you want to watch the dancing. I could see better than most people there, but still not well enough. In the year 2016 I expect people to record a bit with their phones at a concert. I actually appreciate the people who record, so I have fancams to watch when I get home. However, it was worse at this show than any I have ever been to. During ""I am the Best"" I could not see anything at all due to all the giant phones in my way. What makes things worse is that CL is really tiny. The only rock star I've ever met who is shorter is TM Revolution. If you want to be able to see, get close, get up on a balcony/mezzanine, or just be really tall. At one point she was doing a sexy dance lying on the stage, and I heard a ton of cheers coming from the highest mezzanine while I looked at an empty stage.


I don't know why the band was there. In the mix, you could barely hear them. I was wearing my special earplugs that reduce sound evenly at all frequencies by 20db. I could clearly hear CL and the backing track, but the guitar and drums were very faint. Also, as expected, CL does her usual thing where she sings two lines, then lets the vocals on the backing track sing a couple lines, then she sings again. She does that for every single song the entire show. She didn't do it the point where you would get mad. She still sang a ton, and she sang really well. Her voice is in good shape. It's just something that's bothered me about her in general. I'm paying to listen to your voice, and you're only singing half the lines! Someone like IU or Taeyeon sing every word of their songs. Just saying.


Also, it didn't seem like she was dancing as hard as I have seen her in videos. I think that's because she was doing so many songs in rapid succession. If she danced all out, she would be toast before the show was half over. Because she was taking it easy, and maybe also because I was far away and it was hard to see, I couldn't really feel her powerful charisma. That's the main reason I like her, but I didn't get too much of it.


If you are a huge 2NE1/CL fan, you are going to this show. You'll enjoy it even more than I did, and you'll get your money's worth. Get the VIP tickets so you can be close up. If you are a KPop fan who just kinda likes CL, get a cheap ticket up in a seating area like a mezzanine or balcony. If you got money to burn, might as well go for the heck of it. If you are broke, spend your money elsewhere.


It's a very enjoyable 90 minutes of CL singing and dancing. The actual real life CL was on the stage performing not too far away from me. A person I had never seen before outside of YouTube was right there. And all around me were people who know and love this music. That is pretty rare for someone like me who rarely meets KPop fans anywhere besides the Internet. That's a pretty great experience in itself, so I have no regrets.


Just keep in mind, that experience cost me over $100. I would probably do it again, but the value proposition is not so good. Just last week I went to see Gojira at Terminal 5. It was the final show of their North American tour. They melted everyone's faces off for 2 hours. It was glorious. We also got a short set from an opening band what wasn't awful, and an insanely good hour+ set from TesseracT. The ticket cost $35. THAT is value. 


TL;DR: It's a pretty good show with way more songs than you think, but it didn't blow me away. Get VIP tix if you love CL so much. If you just kinda like her, sit in the cheap seats where you can see. If you stay home you aren't missing out on too much, either.",28,122

I think this thread should be at the end of every month, it would be cool to see everyone's monthly favorites.


&amp;nbsp;


Personally, I really LOVED [Selfish &amp; Beautiful Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_ULohi3bcI) from BASTARZ. The music video is so unique and interesting, with the Just Dance + apocalypse concept, and the part at the end where P.O. says something like ""Everyone, isn't this music video annoying?"" is so adorable. The song reminds me of a funkier, more hard hitting version of [Heize's And July \(ft. DEAN\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCeM57e2BfU), another release that I listened to for a good 2 weeks straight. I think this song will also be one of my most listened to, I LOVE how fun it is, and I'm super glad that BASTARZ wasn't just a one time subunit. Block B has been really killing it this year, I hope they get a MAMA, or at least, perform.",48,29

To those who already read it, as I've said countless times, I never meant to offend anyone. It was supposed to be a more general post but my example specifically included the exo fan base due to my practically non existent knowledge of basically all other fandoms. The exo-l and army thing was the only thing that I'd actually seen with my own eyes. Granted, I only really saw a portion that was biased in armies favour. So I was pretty ill informed when I made the post. So I'm sorry if you took it as me attacking exo and your fandom cause that's not I was doing. At least not intending to do. I was looking to get something off my chest while simultaneously getting objective opinions from others. I received plenty of good advice so thank you to those who actually commented something useful. ",97,0

2285,2016-10-31,2016,10,31,12,5aaaon,[Discussion] How do you think comebacks/song releases are planned?,Rankstuff,1477886134,"Title Question: How do you think comebacks/song-releases are planned?

Just wondering because with the release of IOI, TWICE, EXO-CBX, BLACKPINK, and Taeyeon's new music, I can't help but wonder if companies purposely plan for some comebacks to overlap (TWICE and BLACKPINK for example) or if they really just follow a set schedule for some other reason?

I wonder why SM would have Exo-CBX would release a song in the midst of two big girl group releases, and then Taeyeon releases her surprise '11:11' song around this time too.
I feel like these other-wise dominating songs could be overshadowed with other highly anticipated-full group comebacks like BLACKPINK and TWICE.

It's about a month until MAMA, and to be honest, I find the performances at MAMA a lot more satisfying than the awards being won. I had this conversation with a friend earlier today and am interested to see what the rest of this subreddit comes up with! [Last year's setlist, for reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mnet_Asian_Music_Awards#Performers).

Here's mine (in no particular order):
* Red carpet - WJSN, KNK, Astro

* Taeyeon - Why, Collab with Dean on Starlight

* Dean - If his new album comes out before MAMA, lead single from that, + Pour Up feat. Zico

* Block B medley - Toy, Zico solo, BASTARZ

* Rookie stages: NCT and BlackPink

* Twice - Cheer Up &amp; TT, would be keen to see a collab between them and Gfriend (what's the possibility of them doing 
Navillera and Rough?)

* Mamamoo - New comeback song + You're the Best, possibly 1cm?

* SHINee 1of1 (or repackage song), Jonghyun solo, Taemin solo

* Got7 - Hard Carry

* Monsta X - Fighter/All In. Would not be surprised if they weren't on the lineup, or only performed in a collab with Got7, though.

* Seventeen - Very Nice and Pretty U, probably a collab stage with Got7 and/or Monsta X. Don't think it's too likely all 3 
will perform.

* Red Velvet - Russian Roulette

* EXID &amp; Sistar 'sexy concept' collab - I Like That and L.I.E

* BTS - Blood, Sweat, Tears + Fire. Would love to see something a bit more free form from them (like EXO's [Drop That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoDi3PdhnA) performance).

* EXO - CBX subunit, Monster, Lotto (let's pray for lucky one though lmao)
