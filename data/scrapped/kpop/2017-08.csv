17,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-8-1,2017,8,1,11,6qt9cl,self.kpop,Single albums: The value of B-sides (or lack thereof),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6qt9cl/single_albums_the_value_of_bsides_or_lack_thereof/,thouartthee,1501553704,"Over the shower, I was pondering on the fact that YG is only releasing singles nowadays (which isn't new at all; Japanese idols have been doing this for a long time). Of course, many people 'complained' about this (although they're usually still happy with what they get), which makes me ask, ""Why/why not B-sides?"". Then I realised that, in today's world, B-sides have little economical value. I tried to play devil's advocate, except that I can't find any argument for the value of B-sides. So I made this post to find out if this is 'just the case' or if someone can provide a counter-argument.

Based on my observation (not that I have any actual data for my statements), my arguments are:

* ~~B-sides are usually not as good as promotional singles. Why? Because if they're as good as promotional singles, might as well save it for the next promotional cycle.~~ Edit: As people suggested, a lot of good B-sides. I stand corrected on this one.

* Physical albums' sale is predominated by fans that will buy them anyway despite the lack of B-sides.

* Again, for digital albums, most fans will buy them regardless of the number of B-sides, while most non-fans will only know/buy the promotional singles and have little interest in the B-sides.

So, B-sides end up like bubble wraps in packaging; they fill the album, but you only use them (i.e. listen to them) once then forget about them. Of course, hidden gems exist here and there, but the huge majority of B-sides are not even memorable. So, you can say that YG system of only releasing singles is more 'sustainable', in a way that they only spend resource on the important bit (promotional singles) and not on suboptimal products (B-sides).

Edit: I see a lot of people giving feedbacks, and I appreciate it. I still fail to see how B-sides provide a sufficient return for a company to justify investing into it (although as someone mentioned, looking at it from simply economic perspective might is very limiting).",35,0,False,self,,,,,

Sometimes it would be a few words or an exaggeration of an already existing lyric. So for example, a lot of vocalists say ohhhh~ and  yeahhh~ or rappers say come on! and lets go!

Some rapper examples are -

J-Hope's rap where he is like ""gam gam"" and ""ayee"" in [Baepsae](https://youtu.be/9qC7HNFRjEY?t=33). Honestly, all the ad-libs in that song is fantastic.

Anytime Jooheon raps or intros a Monsta X song. Ex, [Hero's ""ya'll know what it is mane""](https://youtu.be/FZ9lJ5ctd0s?t=19) and his [""he hee""s in Rush](https://youtu.be/bSo7gYXp-bA?t=30).

Some vocal examples are- 

Kihyun's ad-libs in [Fighter's](https://youtu.be/wCLveLWKAvQ?t=181) last chorus. 

D.O's ad-libs in [Dancing King](https://youtu.be/pUEOjZWhKDg?t=150). God bless.

**Agenda**

1.     PSA: Search is Broken (**UPDATED**)
2.	New Title Guidelines
3.	[Misc] Flair
4.	Idol Vlogs
5.	Wiki Index Refresh
6.     New Business

---



#### PSA: Search is Broken

Reddit admins [announced some improvements to search](https://redd.it/6pi0kk) last week.  Unfortunately, one of the side effects of this change is that some search operators like `OR` are completely broken.  This means that our ""Search by Flair"" buttons in the sidebar are pretty much useless right now.  The good news is that Reddit admins are aware of the problem and are working to fix it.  We have been in contact with them and they think it will be fixed within the next week.  So if you can't seem to find what you're searching for, that is probably the reason.

**UPDATE:** Reddit admins have made some fixes and now the ""Search by Flair"" buttons in the sidebar should be functioning properly again.  Let us know if you have any issues using them.



#### New Title Guidelines

In [last month's Town Hall](https://redd.it/6klein), you guys let us know that you wouldn't mind if we were more strict on title formatting.  So, in an effort to make our titles clearer and more reader friendly, we've developed some slight tweaks for how we'd like some common submission types formatted.

* **Teasers**

> `Artist - Promotion (Specifics)`  
e.g.  
**Red Velvet - The Red Summer (Seulgi Teasers #1)**   
**KARD - Hola Hola (MV Teaser)**  
**GFriend - Parallel (Tracklist)**

> Currently, it is a little difficult to tell the contents of a teaser or tell the difference between a teaser and an MV without looking at the flair.  We'd like to standardize teasers into this template.  The ""Promotion"" part can be either the album name or the song name if the album isn't known yet, or even just ""Comeback"" if no other info is available at the time.  The ""Specifics"" section should make it clear what type of teaser we're looking at.  This should be easier than trying to make 50 different teaser flairs to cover every possible type.  **EDIT:** If the teaser is also an announcement for the release date, or any other important info, please include it in the title.  These guidelines are merely the minimum required info.

* **Covers**

> `Artist - Song (orig. Artist)`  
e.g.  
**Dreamcatcher - Really Really (orig. Winner)**  
**Kihyun(Monsta X) & Jung Sewoon - Boyfriend (orig. Justin Bieber)**

> The current cover format puts the original artist at the beginning of the headline and is confusing at first glance.  This revision puts the artist performing in the video first and should help people more easily notice cover songs by their favorite artists.  Use the same format for dance covers as well.  For live covers, see the next section.

* **Live Performances**

> `Artist - Song @ Venue (Date)`  
e.g.  
**Blackpink - As If It's Your Last @ SBS Young Street Radio (170626)**  
**Comeback Stage: EXO - KOKOBOP @ MNet M! Countdown (170720)**  
**ZICO - I LUV IT (orig. PSY) @ KBS Yoo Heeyeol's Sketchbook (170722)**

> This is just cleaning up and standardizing the existing format.  We like the use of the @ symbol to make the title more readable, ""Artist - Song AT Location (Date)"", and break it up some.

* **Variety**

> `Artist - Clip Description @ Show Name (Date) [ENG SUB/RAW]`  
e.g.  
**Big Bang - Random Play Dance @ Weekly Idol (170104) [RAW]**  
**Red Velvet - Full Episode @ Knowing Brothers (170708) [ENG SUB]**

> Current guidelines ask for the season and episode number, but we feel that info is non-essential and sometimes difficult to locate.  This format also incorporates the @ symbol as before.  Please remember to include [RAW] or [ENG SUB] when submitting variety clips and episodes.

We will do our best to enforce these guidelines firmly but fairly.  If we see a post that's just a few minutes old and has some minor formatting flaw, we will ask that you please resubmit.  Major deviations from these formats will be removed no matter when they're discovered.  We don't want to be anal and nitpicky, but we do want consistency and readability, and we think that you guys want that too.  These new guidelines are on the [Rules Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_iii._title_formatting_guide) to reference whenever you make a post.  The only way to change a Reddit title is to remove the post and resubmit the link, so please do your best to format correctly the first time.



#### [Misc] Flair

You may have noticed that we slipped in a new flair type a while ago called [Misc].  We'd like to explain what this flair means and when it should be used.  First, it is colored pink like [Variety] because it should primarily be used for official video clips that aren't variety or behind-the-scenes, but are still allowed.  Things like CFs, member introductions, vlogs, reality shows, fan messages, etc. will fall under the [Misc] flair.  We will also occasionally use it for compilations, non-news feature articles, Meet & Greet, etc.  The flair will not be used as a ""catch-all"" or a cover for fluff submissions.  Nothing has changed with regards to what type of submissions are permitted according to the rules.  If you're not sure what flair your submission should have, don't worry about it.  Mods can add or change flair with an easy click, so it's no problem if you get it wrong.



#### Idol Vlogs

There has been a recent surge in idols doing ""Vlog"" shows on YouTube such as Coco, Amber, Peniel, Luna, and Sorn.  Do you guys want to continue seeing links to these vlog episodes on r/kpop?  Does it matter if the Vlog is in English?  Would you prefer to have just the first episode linked and the rest removed?  Do you not care and are happy to see this content?  Mods don't really mind either way, so let us know in the comments how you feel.



#### Wiki Index Refresh

In case you missed our little [mini announcement](https://redd.it/6oyfyx) a few days ago, the [Wiki Index Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/index) has been completely revamped and rebuilt from the ground up by the hardworking /u/eunicity.  It now contains links to everything the r/kpop subreddit has to offer. There are archives for all our weekly features as well as for music shows, plus guides, playlists, historical facts, and much more.

Who bring the boys out? *Girls bring the boys out!*

This month we're tackling The Nation's Girl Group, **Girls Generation** a.k.a SNSD a.k.a SJJD a.k.a  a.k.a Soshi! SNSD is a formerly-9-now-8 member girl group that debuted in 2007 with their self-titled album *Girls' Generation*. I think most of the sub is familiar with their work following *I Got A Boy* so hopefully this gives you an opportunity to hear some of their older stuff (even though we *did* do a throwback album discussion for The Boys). Seeing as they have now hit 10 years as a group and they're slated for a comeback this month I felt it best to focus on them this time as we dive in to one of the most iconic girl groups to ever hit the stage and grace the airwaves. 

To wrap up the intro, here's a brief overview of their legacy. SNSD was a prominent figure in the ""Hallyu Wave"" which is a mass influx in popularity of Korean culture outside Korea mostly in Eastern and Southeastern Asia (Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.). SNSD were very pivotal in bringing back the popularity of girl groups as most groups that debuted in the 2000s had been male (Super Junior, Big Bang, Shinhwa, g.o.d., TVXQ, SS501, etc.). They were one of the first groups to be recognized internationally even by Western countries in the Americas and Europe, their most popular single *Gee* was named ""Song of the Decade"" by MelOn, and they have amassed over **7 million** physical album sales. They are without a doubt one of the most popular and prolific groups and are well deserving of their title as The Nation's Girl Group ^((even though ~~three~~ two of their members are from California; just saying)^) .

### Jessica Departure
So, as with TVXQ! last time, SNSD has their own schism, split, divorce; whatever word hurts you the most. September 30th, 2014a day that will live in infamy (and still does for a lot of people). Jessica Jung, arguably one of the most popular members of SNSD, departed ways with SM and the group, citing the need to go their separate ways. At the time, Jessica was very involved in things outside of Girls' Generation; she was working on a fashion brand and was in China, Hong Kong, New York, etc. while SNSD remained in Korea. She also talked about wanting to get married to Tyler Kwon and was seen with a ring. Jessica and SM both reached an agreement that she would depart from SNSD; she wasn't kicked out, she didn't abandon them; it was mutually decided for sake of pursing diverging interests between the group and Jessica's own business adventures and branding. 

Now, this all seems pretty amicable looking at it now, but it caught a LOT of people off guard at the time. People had a inkling that it was coming due to her relationship with Tyler and some sentiments she'd expressed, but it still came as quite the shock when it was officially announced. And man did it cause a TON of drama. Suddenly you had OT9 & Jessica stans blaming SM for kicking out one of the most popular members. You had Jessica antis that were celebrating her departure and the new OT8. There continues to be quite the rift in the fandoms and, while the majority are bummed she's gone and remember her fondly, there are still VERY vocal groups on both sides that trash SNSD and prop Jessica up at every opportunity or basically pretend Jessica was never in the group in the first place and the REAL members of SNSD still remain. 

But yeah; the real story is a lot less dramatic than people claim it to be. Jessica wanted to focus on other things; SM suggested it was in everyone's best interest she leave; Jessica was okay with this; and then she left. She continues to make music, and even has an album coming out soon (while taking some mild jabs at SNSD in the process; but all tongue-in-cheek, I'm sure). SNSD continues to be active and doesn't show any signs of going anywhere soon. 

### Discography
Now, as is something I've been doing, I am **not** covering SJJDthere's just too much music to fit into a single music spotlight. Maybe in the future I could do a spotlight for their Japanese stuff. But one thing to note is that SJJD and SNSD are not really the same group. Their Japanese releases are more girl-empowering and their fanbase is mostly female. Their Korean releases on the other hand are mostly male fanbase and the girls' concepts are either bubble gum or mature pop. Definitely give their Japanese discography a whirl. 

#### Girls' Generation (2007)
The world's first introduction to Girls' Generation with their self-titled album, *Girls' Generation*. iTunes actually categorizes this under Teen Pop instead of K-Pop haha. It's a very lighthearted album with very safe songs; nothing exactly experimental, but a sound that everyone can appreciate and is very chart friendly. And it did really well on the charts! Reaching number one and selling over 200,000 copies in total.

##### Baby Baby (Repackage)

#### Gee (2009)
(This EP only has 5 songs so I'll just list them all) Their first EP! We definitely get a lot more of an upbeat bubblegum pop sound with this EP. *Gee* and *!* are lighthearted easy listeners. *Dear Mom* slows things down with their first true ballad. *Destiny* actually sounds like an f(x) song so we can definitely see the influence there; along with the more grungy pop songs SNSD tends to put out. *Let's Talk About Love* is another light hearted power ballad.  

* [Gee](https://youtu.be/U7mPqycQ0tQ)

* [Destiny](https://youtu.be/ZCEmMtj3uuQ)
* [   Lets Talk About Love](https://youtu.be/VvBHu9Ix8rs)

#### Tell Me Your Wish (Genie) (2009)
More of the SNSD sound we're used to. *Genie* remains to be one of their most popular songs of all time, coming off of *Gee*, arguable their most popular song of all time. *Tell Me Your Wish* is a solid EP. *One Year Later* is a nice ballad of Jessica and Onew (SHINee) that rounds off the mini nicely.

* [ (My Child)](https://youtu.be/VKszPf66jKU)
* [1  One Year Later](https://youtu.be/R_3UxIlohJU)

#### Oh! (2010)
Album number two! Right off the bat, *Oh!* is a pretty different song from what they've put out beforemuch more electronically influenced.*Show! Show! Show* reminds me a LOT of f(x)'s earlier stuff with the heavy electro-synths and driving rhythms. * & Fun* sounds like something that came out long before 2010I love it. *Forever* is a very nice slow ballad. *Day By Day* is a really mellow song that's just nice and relaxing to listen to. 

* [Oh!](https://youtu.be/TGbwL8kSpEk)
* [ & Fun (Sweet Talking Baby)](https://youtu.be/nZL2KRsZmw0)

This isn't my favorite sound from them. * & Fun* is my favorite song off the album.

##### Run Devil Run (Repackage)

#### Hoot! (2010)
Back to EPs! Title track  (aside from looking like a person wearing a cowboy hat) we get a new sound from SNSD that's departed the more synthy sound of *Oh!*; it sounds like the theme song to a more retro James Bond movie to me (and it was originally called Bulletproof!). *My Best Friend* is a song about the friendships of everyone in SNSD. *Wake Up* is probably the most-different song on the EP and is a lot darker with a deep driving synth. *Snowy Wish* is a nice up-beat synthy pop song that sounds like, well, wintery.

#### The Boys (2011)
This is the album everyone knows. For a full album discussion, we actually did a [throwback discussion](https://redd.it/6fyzpx) a few weeks back. This album was the one that got them really noticed outside of Korea and has cemented itself as one of the essential K-Pop albumseveryone has heard a song off of this album; if you haven't, do so now! SNSD even appeared on [The Late Show with David Letterman](https://youtu.be/exa5-P0_uKo) to perform! The title track *The Boys* is about how, well, the girls bring the boys out. *Trick* tends to be this subreddit's favorite song on the album; upbeat driving synth-pop song with a really unique sound that SNSD had not done before! *Oscar* is another great song in style of *Trick* that is decently underrated. *Top Secret* is a jazzy, brassy song that uses the horns in place of the synth for a fresh sound. *Mr. Taxi* is one of my favorite SNSD songs and is the definition of catchy. Lastly, Snoop Dog has a feature on a remix of *The Boys* that I have to mention and you have to listen to; ""Baby Boo, Congratulations. Girls-Girls Generation."" 10/10

#### I Got a Boy (2013)
A YO GG (She's a cat burglar\*)! Here comes trouble! *I Got A Boy* is a continuation of the sound they discovered with *The Boys* and takes it up another notch.  *I Got A Boy* is a super neat song that I have not heard from any other groupit really stands out as just a song that SNSD nailed. *Dancing Queen* was a remake of *Mercy* by Duffy so how can you go wrong there. ** is one of my favorite songs and I never see it talked aboutdefinitely give that a listen. *Express 999* feels like a throwback to their older song in more of the *Oh!*/*Hoot* era. ** feels like a song to just sit down in a coffee shop and reminisce to; I love it.

\* Yes I know she doesn't actually say that. 

#### Mr.Mr. (2014)
This album picks a modern electropop and R&B style. I actually think *Goodbye* is the best song on the album as I was not a fan of *Mr. Mr.*. *Mr. Mr.* has EDM influences along with the electropop sound. *Goodbye* is absolutely pop-rock and it is awesome; driving beat, great flow, and an awesome sound. ** feels like a synthpop song straight from the 80s with a twist. *Wait A Minute* is very much a jazzy-pop track with some great singing.

#### Lion Heart (2015)
And here we have the latest iteration of the wonderful sounds of SNSD. I adore this album. *Lion Heart* is a retro influenced soul-pop song that you can't get tired of. *You Think* as the second title song is the complete opposite; heavy on a driving EDM-influenced synth sound with some powerful vocals. *Party* some people considered a vapid, silly, care-free song when it came out... but.... that doesn't make it bad :). *Show Girls* goes back to their electropop sound and is super fun. *Paradise* is a synth-pop song that has a great main riff and some awesome harmonies. *Check* is a modern R&B track.

On August 2s episode of the radio show Yoon Hyung Bin and Yang Se Hyungs Two Man Show, host Yang Se Hyung announced hes a big fan of Orange Caramel and asked Raina why they havent released anything recently.

Raina laughed over his enthusiasm and admitted, Im asked that a lot. Id like it if we did too, but I think there are a lot more junior artists at our agency now, including groups and solo artists.

Raina said they had been planning to do something new and even recorded for it, but the agency decided to look for something better for them. It kept getting delayed over time, she said.

Weve also gotten older, and I think the agency wonders if it would be good for us if we continue with this image, she added. When the hosts insisted that a lot of fans want them to return, Raina said, Yes, I think its a shame too.

Yang Se Hyung said he had wondered if there had been an issue between the members or with the company, but Raina insisted that wasnt the case.

Its been postponed, she clarified. But if the song was really good But it has to be really powerful. Thats Orange Caramels identity. I think we all think that if we did a pretty concept, itd be better to just not do it at all. But its hard to find that kind of thing.

Hosted by  the one and only Rain, this will also mark Rain's first return to broadcasts following his marriage to actress Kim Tae Hee this past January.

There has been many shows in recent years with involving trainees with most of them hoping to debut for the first time. But this show is for idols that have already debuted to be given a chance to debut again. The show will give them the opportunity to show the talent that people might've missed out on. It is still unclear what groups will be on the show. I hope you find this a fascinating idea. 
It is expected to air in October 2017.

Ever listen to a song for the ten millionth time and suddenly hear a weird animal screeching in the background? I heard the crow cawing to the beat of the pre-chorus of ""Hows This"" by Hyuna and now I can never un-hear it. My other favorite example of this is Junsu saying ""you know that you can go down on me"" towards the end of Mirotic. A lot of people miss that one.

The first Thursday of each month now features a thread with a unique theme to post your throwback videos.

This month's theme is going to be ""**Solo Releases**""!

**What is a solo release?** So, for this, we're going to limit this to official releases that are credited to a single artist (excluding features). Now, this applies to fully solo artists like BoA, IU, Im Chang-jung, Se7en, JYP, etc. as well as idols who have had solo releases such as Taeyeon, G-Dragon, XIA/Junsu, Zico, etc. 

Now, to preserve the spirit of TBT, the ""throwback"" element does have to be preserved. As such, submissions to the TBT should be **at least one year old**. 

For this TBT monthly, the emphasis is on releases put out by a single artist (again, excluding features). It **does not** have to be a full album releaseOSTs, singles, they all work! It just has to be an **official release** so no Instagram/YouTube-channel covers or things like that. Now, to preserve the intent as well, appearances of solo artists aren't inherently solo releases. So posting a Block B song because that's the group Zico belongs to does not count as a solo release. Other than that, have fun!

I came into kpop late 2010, and SNSD was the group that got me there. They serve as a timetable of my kpop life before 2014 and it was interesting thinking how my fan/stan level has changed throughout the years so I made this list to detail it out. (Korean title songs only) 

Gee/Genie/Oh!/RDR/Hoot  (11/10)  I still consider my early kpop years, my golden age, because I dont think any group will means as much to me as SNSD did back in 2010/2011. All I listened to was SNSD and nothing else. I considered myself a hardcore Sone and Gorjess back in the day. I even remember putting SNSD and SONE as my clan tag in Black Ops 1. Jessica during the genie era is still the most gorgeous and iconic look in all of kpop for me. 

The Boys - (7/10)  The Boys disappointed me so much. I loved the teasers however I still consider this song the worst title track SNSD has ever put out and the ending of the great run that SNSD had from debut to then. I thought the Korean title track was mediocre stemming mainly from the awkward chorus. The English version was so much worse. I still dont acknowledge that song. I thought the album itself was alright with Vitamin being my standout however this era really killed the momentum they had for me at the time. Mainly during this era, I just watched and listened to their older stuff. 

IGAB  (8/10)  SNSD got me back with IGAB. I thought the title track was a lot better than the boys and I remember liking the album more too. I still have the Jessica version in my album collection. However, I was beginning to grow tired with kpop in general.

Mr.Mr.  (5/10)  Song was boring and I remember thinking the ep was mediocre was well. By this point I remember being more excited for Red Velvet.  

The Jessica Mess of 2014  (0/10)  After Jessica left SNSD, I hard quit kpop entirely. While the removal was a big part of the reason, my general fatigue of kpop was probably the other big reason. I still think that after 2013, both JYP and YG have yet to give me constantly good music.  

End of Lionheart Era  (2/10)  I came back to kpop thanks to Red Velvet and the incredible Red album. However, I was still bitter about SNSD and Jessica so for the longest time I would go out of my way to avoid SNSD music though I couldnt ignore songs like gee and genie. 

The start of the Holiday Night Era  (8/10)  Starting late early 2017, the bitterness I felt for SNSD really started to go away and I started to watch their old variety shows and listened to their old music again on a regular basis. Upon listening to Lionheart, it was definitely one of the best albums they have been out. Shoutouts to Paradise and Sign. Plus, their solo stuff wasnt too bad. Now we are on the doorstep of what I hope to be a renewal of my love for SNSD and I am so pumped for what this album will give me.    

This was my experience with SNSD and I want to see how your fandom level has changed throughout the eras of your favorite group. You can group and skip era if you want like I did.

[R&B/Soul] [Younha - Take Five](https://youtu.be/16sXoYFWL4c)
>First up this month is a remake of a Seo Taiji song called Take Five by Younha. The song was re-recorded as part of Seo Taijis 25th anniversity remake project, Time: Traveler.

>Some background info on Seo Taiji in case you dont know who he is. Seo Taiji is one of the most important figures in the Korean music industry, and he is heavily credited with being one of several (including the founders of the Big 3 entertainment companies) who influenced and jumpstarted the Hallyu wave. In 1992, Seo Taiji formed Seo Taiji and the Boys. Through this group, he experimented with many different genres of Western music. As a result, the Hallyu wave was born.

>Take Five is the eighth track on Seo Taijis eponymous first solo album, Seo Taiji. The album was released in 1998 after Seo Taiji and the Boys had disbanded, and every song in the album was composed, played, and produced by himself and himself only. Despite the albums lack of promotion, it sold over 1 million copies when it was finally released in the United States.

>As for Younha, she is a rock singer-songwriter who has had quite a lengthy career in both the Korean and Japanese music scenes; she has released 9 studio albums and EPs in Korea and 4 studio albums and EPs in Japan altogether. Although several of her songs have been featured in Japanese animes and dramas, she is most well-known for two hits: Houki Boshi, which became an ending song for the anime Bleach, and Umbrella.

>Younhas remake of Take Five leans towards a more soft R&B/acid pop sound, while the [original Seo Taiji version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJLVtX9Byy0) was all rock. Compared to all the bubbly, vibrant songs that have been released this summer, Younhas Take Five is a nice change of pace. It doesnt lose its calm and composed groove, and if I were to offer an analogy, Id say it is akin to a relaxing drive by the beach as opposed to a bustling beach party.

>The MV features Shin Se Kyung, an actress who also featured in Seo Taijis music videos back when she was a child. Finally, since the video doesnt have lyrics, I have added them [here](https://popgasa.com/2017/07/19/younha-take-five-original-seo-taiji/). Enjoy!

[Tropical House] [KARD - Hola Hola](https://youtu.be/USx4WyrkfU4)
>As Im not really one to jump onto bandwagons, I wasnt a big fan of KARD at first. I thought everyone liked them just because they were the first co-ed group to debut in South Korea, but with Hola Hola, I can see now that theyre not just a group of friends that gained fame because of their specialty  they also have star appeal, decent music and sharp choreography.

>KARD is a four-member co-ed group that consists of J.Seph, Jiwoo, Somin and BM. They made it onto my radar when they released their first official single, [Oh Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPTcKSVAEvA), in December of 2016. They quickly followed that up with [Dont Recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Dp7Q-SM1Y) in February and [Rumor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LPjJ1p4dYs) in April. Hola Hola, their next major single, was released as their official debut and as the title of their first mini album.

>The title Hola Hola is a play on , which is pronounced olla in Korean. It also means to rise up, an ode to soaring melodies and soaring spirits all day long and all night long. The song is also inspired by Tropical House music; you can expect plenty of palm trees, warm weather, light clothing and bright smiles as you watch this music vid!

[Electronica/R&B] [offonoff - Cigarette (ft. Tablo, MISO)](https://youtu.be/ul_OqojSu44)
>Probably one of my favorite releases this month, Cigarette is the 2nd track off of offonoffs 1st full album, boy. The song features rapper Tablo and singer MISO alongside Colde, one of the two members that form the electronica duo offonoff.

>Cigarette personifies offonoff. Similar to prior singles such as [Photograph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b1E-zu-QEM) and [Moon, 12:04AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZqFDAdT5s), the song carries a hypnotic, trance-like haziness that evokes the sensation of a late night smoke-filled room. Listening to Cigarette, you cant help but feel drawn to the scent and wisps of grey, curling up and away towards the dim lights above.

>Although I am in love with MISO and Coldes seemingly-numbed duet in the verses, I think Tablos rap is the icing on the cake. He works his genius and verbal versatility with such profound brilliance that one cant help but listen to him again and again and again.

[R&B/Rap] [ONE -   (Gettin' By)](https://youtu.be/_0DlHmnGeIo)
>I didnt know who ONE was until I was introduced to him earlier this month by my friend. Hes a rapper who debuted in 2015; however, he changed companies after the hip-hop group he was a part of, 1PUNCH, disbanded. Hes now signed under YG Entertainment, and  , or Gettin By, is the title track of his YG debut single.

>Honestly, when I first listened to this song, I wasnt like, Wow, this is an absolute killer, I really need to share this song. Its kind of repetitive, the lyrics arent exactly memorable (well, they kind of are in a get-stuck-in-your-head kind of way), and the song has an incredibly pedestrian title.

>It seems this was what ONE had [intended](http://seoulbeats.com/2017/07/one-looks-good-in-gettin-by-and-heyahe/) though. In its ordinary everyday-ness, Gettin By becomes a down-to-earth, relatable track. Like most relationships and break-ups, his werent anything like a movie or drama. Thus, life goes on, and he keeps gettin by.

[Dance/Pop] [Red Velvet - The Red Summer](https://youtu.be/WyiIGEHQP8o)
>Red Velvet is officially back, and with the release of their 5th EP, The Red Summer, they officially saved summer! Well, thats just my personal opinion. But Im a big and biased fan.

>The Red Summer is Red Velvets 5th EP, and it cant get any more summer-y than this (thats a good thing). Its got five lush and breezy tracks, and all of them showcase different sides and moods of the summer season while pushing the envelope of musicality and originality. If theres anything I like about Red Velvet, its that they are able to expand the definition of what it means to be K-Pop without becoming constricted by the label itself. They are impressive in that they continue to find new ways to push their musical boundaries while maintaining their distinctive, personal sound.

>Red Flavor is the first and title track of The Red Summer, and it simply gushes with boundless energy and dulcet delight. Joy, Seulgi, Irene, Yeri and Wendy dance to their hearts content while singing of their favorite flavor: the flavor of summer.

[Special Mention] [Jang Hyunseung - HOME](https://youtu.be/ve_4K4-ZEpA)
>At first, I thought HOME was too slow and sentimental to include in this list. It is a deep and heartfelt song with a plaintive melody.

>The more I listened to it, though, the more I wanted to share it with you. HOME moved me to tears, and not many songs are able to do that to me. To understand how and why this song is significant, you need to understand Jang Hyunseungs history.

>Jang Hyunseung is a singer who was once part of the 6-member boy band BEAST. The group disbanded in April of 2016 due to a difference in musical taste, and Hyunseung left CUBE Entertainment to pursue his own musical path. On July 31st, he posted a [personal apology](https://www.soompi.com/2017/07/31/jang-hyunseung-writes-personal-apology-attitude-controversies-time-beast/) on his Instagram in which he opened up about his pride and attitude during his time with BEAST and how he feels he has only given others pain and scars. He feels deeply regretful, and this song, which was released less than a week ago, can be interpreted as not only his sincere apology to his fans and group members but also his struggle to find a home and place all by himself.

JYPE last year made a distribution deal with CMC (later bought by Tencent) and in addition to this deal they created a joint venture for future cooperation.

http://koreabizwire.com/jyp-signs-exclusive-distribution-contract-with-china-music-corporation/50157
 
From this article (http://www.qdaily.com/cooperation/articles/yidian/26924.html) and a  crappy google translation it looks like CMC made different deals with Japanese and Korean company to incorporate their model and make international cooperations

""At the same time they also try to learn overseas experience to do a complete artist broker industry chain, and with Japan AKS (AKB48 brokerage firm), South Korea JYP cooperation, learn from its artists to develop model, and its offline art school and brokerage firm Transport the trainees. In April this year, Ocean Music and JYP jointly established the Beijing Xin Sheng Entertainment Co., Ltd. in the indoor recreational facilities operation, organization of cultural and artistic exchanges and film and television planning and other aspects of cooperation. ""
 
So a few months after that JYP, Jackson, Fei and a 10 year old JYP chinese trainee gifted in dance went to China to record this massive roadshow-style Audition show to recruit more trainees to create a hip hop oriented Chinese boy group. The name of the show was ""Guaishushu is coming"" and the concept was to travel across different cities and mix visits of the cities, with large scale auditions and then a big final round to select the members that will train in Korea. The show was supposed to air around November/December 2016, unfortunately the show never aired, one of the main reason is probably the intensification of the backlash against K-entertainment due to THAAD.

We didn't even know the one who won but here are just some videos of some contestants that JYP posted on his ig at the time:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BKTnWUnAO_K/?taken-by=asiansoul_jyp

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back to now:

6 boys were selected and trained for about 9/10 months in JYPE Korea.

As the pre debut show can't air, they will do 1 year of pre debut activities debuting September even if we should get more info in a few days

They will release 3 more MVs (in December, March, June) after that until their debut in August 2018

WINNER is my favorite boy group (digged them since KSY solo/WIN days) and this comeback was way too fucking good. Told myself Id attend one recording just for fun. I sent in my email right when it opened and got a really good number: 6/150. However, a lot of priority went to registered Inner Circle membership holders, so I wasnt in standing. 

Got to MuCore around 7 AM, saw a LOT of fangirlsno fanboys in sight. I was the only one at the recording. WINNER fans are really chill though, they have a lot of noona fans. I waited in line a bit and a Korean Inner Circle that helped me get albums for Fate Number For recognized me and was surprised to see me there, haha. She talked to me a bit and then check-in started. Got the usual stamp card, sticker, and slogan towel for our broadcast goods. The color scheme for this comeback was really great.

We had about half an hour to kill before they let us in the studio, so the Korean Inner Circle (ill call her the awesome fangirl from here on) bought me breakfast and told me a lot of neat stuff about the fandom and upcoming schedules. When it was time to line back up, I didnt have to wait that long before we went inside. I got seated in the center with a very solid view. The studio was pretty crowded today, Id say about close to 500 fans got in for this recording (pit and seating included). The pit was insanely packed. All the fangirls had their WINNER lightsticks - it was really cool to see which fans came from Japan since the color scheme is different as well. There were quite a few of them, too. 

Without further ado memorable moments of the recording (3 takes total including 1 warm-up):

- Stage setup has a huge WINNER W hanging overhead. 
- During the warm-up rehearsal, the members came out and the girls screamed. Only Love Me Love Me was set for prerecording. Dance formation starts with four male backup dancers in the front (Kwon Twins spotted for all you YG stans!!), with Yoon in the back one arm up doing the finger heart. Side note: one of the Kwon twins was sporting a hairstyle very reminiscent of Nam Taehyun. According to the awesome fangirl, fans thought it was actually Taehyun and everybody ??? until they realized it was one of the twins lmao. 
- The first warm up started really abrupt. The dance starts with a fun jump, but as soon as they landed, Seungyoon just looked around (looked like a deer in headlights) to make sure they were actually rolling. He awkwardly stood still for 10 seconds scanning the studio for the OK before he continued the rehearsal. Many laughs were had. 
- Point dance of the song involves a lot of finger hearts and cheesy dance moves. When Seunghoons rap starts, female dancers come in and theres a lot of cheesy heart moments in the choreography and some flirty dancing. 
- First rehearsal was over and they replayed it on the screen. At one point during the chorus dance breakdown, Jinwoo had a really really huge smile on his face and all the girls screamed. He looked so happy and innocent. After the songs climax, the camera panned on Mino and it caught him dancing like a god damn grandpa and all the girls laughed. 
- Members came back without name tags. Dancers and all the members but Seungyoon already took formation. He ran to the stage like an embarrassed kid running to his parents and quickly took his place. A lot of cute comments were made in the crowd. 
- Fan chants came out really loud. The fangirls absolutely loved it when Jinwoo is on camera. Anything he did when the camera was on him, everybody fucking screamed. Anytime it was on Mino, people laughed because he was being a goofball. 
- Before rolling on the first official take, the camera zoomed on on Seunghoon and it was shown on screen. All the girls were mumbling and he did a surprise heart and all the girls died. 
- Yoon ad-libs in the outro. Yoon vocals are no joke. 
- Ending pose of the song: they spell LOVE using their arms. 


Personally had fun, just wanted to hear the song live. I really enjoy their music and that was the main reason I went. Honestly, it felt a little unsettling for me to be the only fanboy there, but it was a nice break to get out of my comfort zone. I had a good time.

As for my second place, [KARD - I can't stop](https://youtu.be/hSdNylogM8Y) is my pick. The song just has such an unique vibe to it, I can't point out what makes it so outstanding but it almost has a 'mythical' feel to it. I love it and think it's KARD's best song.

What are y'all choices? Also make sure to say why!

A piece of advice I wish someone had given me, was to learn WJSN's names through their subunits. It's a system that worked well when learning Seventeen and Exo's names and it would've saved me a ton of time, trying to remember each members name.",171,129,False,self,,,,,

Melon is a popular music chart which is used to show the popularity of a song. Melon is owned by Loen Entertainment.
Loen Entertainment is a large entertainment company which houses IU.
Loen Ent also has a 70% stake in Starship Ent which has Boyfriend, Monsta X, Cosmic Girls, K.Will, Hyoylyn, Soyou, Mad Clown and Junggigo (notable chart artists were listed)
Loen Ent aslo has a 70% stake in Plan A Entertainment which has Huh Gak, Eunji (solo release) and A Pink.

Loen Ent is a subsidiary of Kakao Group as of 2016 with a 76% stake where there are a number of other connections.
Whether people believe sejegi happens or not is another issue but there are numerous financial connection with Melon music.
JTBC was said to suggest there was music chart manipulation to which Melon had to respond
'We are monitoring abnormal use [on our site]. In the case of multiple duplicate IDs being used abnormally, we have a system that has been made to prevent this influencing our charts. Even if there is 'sajaegi' it doesn't affect the music chart. We are putting in our best effort to keep the fairness [on our site].'

I've been a kpop fan for over a decade (but I've been into anime since I was a kid, if that makes a difference), but only recently did I meet someone who I thought would take a liking to kpop since she liked korean dramas. Maybe it's because I've been a fan for so long that I've forgotten what it was like to watch kpop videos and participate in the fan culture for the first time (apart from the usual 'boys who look like girls' moment), but I was initially surprised that I had to explain terms like ""stan"" or ""otp"" or ""bias""; even things like fansites, online voting, stanning one kpop company and so on. 

Basically, I was just wondering what are the things you learnt when you got into kpop and kpop fandoms. Things that were strange at first, but you got used to. Not just trivial things, but things like learning about the workings of a record label/kpop company, idea of masculinity, fan behaviour, etc. ",170,119,False,self,,,,,

GOT7/JJP did this recently for me. I liked them a lot back in the days, but If you do turned out to be what I liked best of them. Flight log: departure (March 2016) was the last album I bought from them, I didn't follow them anymore thereafter since their musical direction didn't fit me anymore. This recent JJP comeback has totally turned me around however. I like every single song of the album and the [title song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktdqlQ1zhg4) is a blessing which I play at least 10 times per day and I'm totally going to buy the album the next time I'm ordering stuff online.

What made you stay?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6rzpn0/have_you_ever_wanted_to_leaveunstan_either_a/,2102014,1502041215,"I've been into Kpop since around late 2012/early 2013, and I think it's made me learn a bit about myself, and it's provided me a lot of happiness, music to listen to, and content to watch. Lately, though, I feel like I should take a step back and not be so invested in it? I'm going to be a college sophomore in the fall and although it's the summer now, I know I won't have nearly as much time to stay updated. For me, I like being really devoted/dedicated so I like to stay on top of updates (though I think I should really work on that and try to care less). I also feel like it's very easy to get sucked into fandoms in Kpop especially if you use twitter or tumblr or some other form of social media for updates.

Have you ever wanted to unstan a group or just Kpop in general? Why and what made you stay (assuming you did stay because you're still on this sub lol)?

Disclaimer: In no way, am I asking people to bash groups/idols they used to stan. I'm genuinely curious of the reasons because I know idols can be problematic, and I want to be aware of what they've done. 
I also know that sometimes people just don't feel as strongly about a group anymore so they just decide to revert to casual listening or just unstan altogether.",88,32,False,self,,,,,

I hope I'm doing it right). 

What song(s) would you trade with idol(s) of the opposite sex, even for a single performance? Cookie points if you plan out different aspects of it, like the line distribution, the way the costumes should look, everything!

For example, I would kill for a boy group to give ""Vibrato"" by STELLAR a shot, maybe MONSTA X? Or a group with an equal sexuality that matches that song. 

If I had it my way, I would make a special group with Jinyoung (GOT7), Minhyuk or Sungjae (BTOB), Ten (NCT) and Jimin (BTS). 

I'm torn between Minhyuk/Sungjae or Jimin as a main vocal, though, but just thinking about the designing of the customes (which I already have sketched, for a project) and the creativity they could come out choreography wise, ugh, it makes me so excited.

For girls, ""The Chaser"" by INFINITE is the song I would trade with a girlgroup like PRISTIN or maybe LOVELYZ, who knows? 

What are your thoughts? I'm excited to read your ideas.",79,78,False,self,,,,,

How are two people dating a scandal????? Unless the person they are dating is some kind of murder or notorious hoe then I would understand. But no. We are talking about two normal human beings who are allowed to fall in love. You crazy ""fans"" think that you own them when they probably don't even know your names. ""Oppa only dates me."" Ok then get in line with all the other thousands of hoes that say the same thing. ""Ew they are dating that?"" They are not here on this earth to date people that other people like but rather who they like.

A sad example of this is how people were outraged at Sungmin of Super Junior, telling him to not participate in the group's next comeback. Why? Because he's fucking married. Married. That's the reason. Scandalous I know. And the fact that all this unnecessary hate actually made him sit this comeback out, boggles my mind. It's like marriage = end of idol life and I hate that so much. You should do what you love. It's like once you get an A+ on a test, you're kicked out of school. Makes no fucking sense.

Lately I've been seeing a lot more funny posts here on kpop as well as over at r/kdrama, but often times the posts, while bringing me a good chuckle, felt out of place. So I went ahead and created as space for all that funny content that the Korean scene is bringing us. So if you've got a hilarious set of images of T.O.P. eating waffles, share the laughter with us on r/kfunny. Did you witness the grandest of kimchi slaps, gif it or link and share the laughter with us over r/kfunny

873,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-8-8,2017,8,8,3,6s7fqs,self.kpop,"BP Rania fans are boycotting the upcoming comeback ""Beep Beep Beep""",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6s7fqs/bp_rania_fans_are_boycotting_the_upcoming/,McFlurreh,1502129814,"BP Rania is currently having their pre-comeback series of busking / guerrilla performances before they release the music video, and their fans (A1sts) are absolutely mad at DR Music.

[Alex is still stuck in the corner, not dancing the full choreography, even though this is her fourth time promoting with Rania.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcGF7U-Urkw)

All the 6 years Rania has been together, DR Music has done the following:

* They lost 7 members. No original members remain.
* Disrespected Teddy Riley by using his name to sell Rania without his authorization, which resulted in a loss of a huge opportunity for the girls. Teddy Riley is now with SM Entertainment.
* Rania has never been promoted correctly, and DR Music does not inform fans of anything. Information can only be collected by finding things out.
* Didn't sue a sasaeng fan who still harasses the members daily, **leaked a comeback song** prior to Demonstrate resulting in the comeback being canceled, and harassed fans. They are *still in communication with her* and no action has been done to stop her.
* Did not provide a Korean teacher for both Alex and Ttabo, resulting in language barriers.
* Is not providing Alex with the correct visa; every visa she's had has been for less than 90 days.
* Has never given Alex consistently matching outfits with the rest of the members.
* Didn't protect Alex when the former choreographer chose to willingly not incorporate Alex in the dance, and paid the new choreographer to only choreograph Beep Beep Beep for five members.
* Didn't send Alex the choreography while she was trapped in the United States; DR Music refused to give her an airplane ticket back to South Korea until a few days ago. She's been in the U.S. since February, halfway through Make Me Ah promotions.
* Removed Alex from her co-leader position; the leader now is only Jieun.

A1sts are boycotting the comeback by refusing to watch the MV when it comes out, refusing to stream or purchase the mini-album when it is released, and are not giving DR Music any money until the issues with Alex are resolved. If this results in disbandment of the group, then so be it.

DR Music is fully aware of how the fans feel about Alex's situation, and are actively refusing to do anything about it. Petitions have been made, messages have been sent, managers have been emailed directly. They are set on continuing their discriminatory practices toward Alex.

Fans are using #OT6OrNothing as a hashtag for their boycott.

Hope this isn't against sub rules.

SMs official rhythm game, Superstar SMTown is turning 3 and having a special event starting tonight North American Time, or Wednesday afternoon Korean time.

All the songs will be unlocked so you can play all your fav's songs! There will also be daily rewards, more burning time (double exp time), etc, so it's a good time to start the game!

The game is pretty F2P unless you want limited edition cards, wich don't have any boost to your score, or if you want to win official signed cds you probably need to shell out some money. This past weeks signed CD giveaway (Exos new CD) was actually skill based to enter the draw, yay f2p players!

There is  pretty active sub over at r/superstarsmtown

For android I download the apk from Qoo App, wich is a Chinese app store. Not sure how to get it on IOS but there have been posts on the game's subreddit explaining how to download for IOS.

Happy tapping! ",26,89,False,self,,,,,

So after looking up through Tidal, Deezer, Spotify, GPM, and AM I found that the solution might be Google Play Music, it's selection it's a little bit worse than Spotify's (I'm in Latin America so that might be the reason) but you can UPLOAD your music, and it _stays_ in the cloud, you can delete from your computer afterwards, and it stays there. Oh and the Android app it's pretty good.

For example today I wanted to listen to Crazy by 4Minute, but it wasn't in GPM, and neither it is on Spotify, if I was with Spotify, I would be screwed, if I was in AM, I'd have to wait literally 15 secs for it to even start playing, and if I wanted to watch a YT video while in the middle of listening, the app would've disappeared. With GPM, I just have to download the album and upload it (or just the song). Even though it might be tedious at the beginning, I won't have this problem anymore with that song/album, it's done, and I don't have to worry about it disappearing from the app like in Spotify. So even though while you're setting up your library you might notice that some albums are not there, you can upload them and you won't have to worry about it again. So yeah, I hope my suffering helps someone!",38,23,False,self,,,,,

The subreddit's CSS is ancient and could possibly cause retina damage.  We're planning to completely overhaul the look and feel of r/kpophelp, but the shining jewel of any subreddit is its banner image.  We need a new one and it needs to be awesome!  That's why we've decided to run a small contest to help entice all of our wonderful artists and budding graphic designers out into the open to help us.  Here are the details:

**Theme:** The new r/kpophelp banner should be kpop focused and themed around questioning, learning, or teaching.  Think chalkboards, labcoats, glasses, and idols.  It should be fun, but not memeworthy or ironic.  It will probably be used for quite a while, so it should be something that will still be pleasant to look at in a couple years.

**Size:** 1920px wide x 223px tall

**Prize:** A brand new kpop album of your choice shipped directly from Korea.  If you win, just tell us what album you want and one of our mods in Korea will run down to the corner store, pick it up for you, and ship it out.  Please no extra expensive or rare collector's editions.

**Rules:** Entries will close at 12:00 noon UTC on Wednesday, August 16th.  You may enter up to five banners.  Upload your banners to imgur and submit the link to modmail using the button below.  **Do not post your banners in this thread.**  There will be a separate voting thread next week.

So much in fact, that these days, idols will react to their own MVs or fan-related videos.  Especially through the M2 channel where they talk about the MV or through reacting to their own live stages.  Even JYP's Still Alive had Youtube reactors in the video itself.  It's an interesting trend

Today, NCT 127 [released a reaction video to the winners of the dance contest for Cherry Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vp-FqpzjlI), with includes my favorite cover group East2West who got 1st place.  Is there any others that you think are notable?

Some others I like  
1.[BTS reacting to BST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzS5g9UldGY). The whole thing is great but 5:39 is too perfect  
2.[BTS reacting to The Ark's cover of Boy in Luv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV-bPvdHnM) (Notable for finishing the reaction in an actual dance battle)

Who do you think has the most staying power in the industry?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6sqi7d/now_that_the_ioi_members_have_all_debuted_how_do/,funwithgoats,1502333225,"When I say they've all debuted I'm operating under the assumption that Sohye won't be an idol and that Somi won't debut traditionally or for a very long time. I also won't count WJSN and DIA as 'debuts' since they've been around for awhile, but feel free to discuss them if you like. So, we're dealing with Weki Meki, Pristin, Gugudan and solo Chungha.

My opinion on the debuts: 

1. Pristin - HI! Pristin
   
 In my opinion, Pristin has had the most successful debut out of the four. While 'Wee Woo' wasn't really my thing music wise, I think that the mini itself is really solid. 'Running' and 'Be the Star' are really stand out tracks and the fact that the girls were involved in the song writing this early will really add to their longevity in the industry imo. Their styling and concept are also A+.

2. Chungha - Hands On Me

 I honestly didn't expect to like this much as I'm not really into solos but I was proven wrong. While her voice isn't super strong (and I still think she should be in a group), this was a good album. I'm obsessed with 'Make a Wish' - auto tune and all. But does she have the chops to carry on like this for a long time? Not so sure about that - time will tell.

3. Weki Meki - WEME

 'I don't like your girlfriend' wasn't what I expected at all and, music wise, I'm a bit disappointed. Their mini is firmly in average territory for me. It's not bad but nothing is getting stuck in my head - overall not memorable. Their styling and concept however is another story. The 'teen crush' concept is really young and fresh and has mad potential. Their dancing at their debut showcase was also full of attitude and entertaining as hell so I have hope for their future.

4. Gugudan - Act 1 The Little Mermaid

  I don't know what to say about Gugudan - their debut was very forgettable which is honestly a feat on Jellyfish's part with God Sejeong in there. Besides the boring music, the styling was cheap and unattractive. Although musically they've redeemed themselves a bit with 'Act 2 Narcissus' ('A Girl Like Me' and 'Rainbow' are strong tracks) their styling is still not good. Those purple outfits and a lot of their other stage outfits just look so cheap and dated - for some reason they remind me of kids playing dress up with mommy's clothes. The whole concept is dated - Weki and Pristin are going with the individual-outfits-that-are-still-cohesive and it really helps to pick out individuals and give each person their own flavour. Gugudan has none of that. I wish Mina was somewhere else - she would look so good in Weki. She needs a group with attitude. I hope her sub-unit does well.  ",83,155,False,self,,,,,

Thanks to some lovely people in the town hall and the mods I have decided to start up a Nugu spotlight. 

Every second Sunday I will post a thread of all the nugu groups/soloists that have had comebacks or debuts in the previous two weeks. If youre a fan of any of the groups/soloists posted, tell us about them. Tell us your favourite B sides/other title tracks or your favourite variety shows that theyve been on. Introduce the members to us. Even if youre not a fan but enjoyed one of the songs posted, tell us why. 

The groups will be added based on whether I think theyre nugu or not. For example, even though Wanna One just debuted, they wont be added to the roundup. Red Velvet/EXO/BlackPink wont be added either. However, if you disagree with any of the decisions I have made, send me a message or comment explaining why and I will consider it?

The first one will be posted on Sunday the 13th and will compromise of groups/soloists that have released songs from the 30th to the 12th. 

I hope you guys get involved and help to spread awareness and love to your favourite nugus.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

Thank you all so much if you decide to get involved.

I think I would be Rap Mon in BTS. I don't see myself as a leader, but here are other similarities. He's a professional & conscientious person, with a great work ethics, who I suspect is pretty serious most of the time. However, when he needs to/wants to, he could let go and do all those aegyo stuff or [make himself ridiculous](https://youtu.be/ax06EeMh754). He also [seems to question and doubt himself a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n24XPz7UZ7Q), though that might be a young adult thing (dude is 22). 

For better or worse, another thing we may share in common is an [eagerness to please - sorry for the clickbaity YouTube link](https://youtu.be/QiKC0xbTANU?t=41s). Finally, I also like to read and draw heavily from books/music for my daily inspiration. 

Note: Obviously, what I say here is pure speculation based on the very filtered image that idols present to us. I hate the thought that we can know who these people are based on what they project, but it's just harmless fun :).",25,23,False,self,,,,,

However for the past years I've become frustrated by mainstream pop music. I no longer found singers who released ballads or catchy pop songs. Ever since Lorde became a thing, many singers have been emulating her and it has made radio less friendly to the kind of pop I enjoyed although there have been exceptions like Ariana Grande or Little Mix. 

Which is when I began listening to Kpop and I must admit I was hesitant at first however the more I began to watch the videos and discover the artists, the more enamored I became. I was swooned by the vocal prowess of singers like Ailee, Ali, IU, 4Men, Ben, Sohyang, Urban Zakapa. The bubble-gum pop of Gfriend was as feel-good as anything I could wish for. A bit like an opening of an anime series with a dash of A*Teens (a band I was obsessed with as a kid), Spica was a blast with the kind of amazing vocals a band like Girls Aloud would wish for. The choreography, the stylish music videos, the bright colors. I've even been watching variety specials where I got to listen to Bada or Insooni. Today I'm a big fan, it is an oasis to a period where the kind of pop I used to enjoy is lacking in the airwaves. It might be seen as uncool by some I know, I don't care. ABBA was seen as uncool and look at how everybody sees them as a legendary band. ",63,24,False,self,,,,,

All of these findings started around a day or two before BigHit posted the [Jungkook poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6stv7y/bts_love_yourself_jungkook_poster/), when Jin tweeted a photo with the caption [""smeraldo""](https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/895191758233112577).  

[/r/bangtan's thread of the theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6sl4et/bts_comeback_theory/) also has unearthed some other evidence. There's some speculation here and there in the [Jungkook poster thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6stvbq/170811_bts_love_yourself_jungkook_edition/) as well. 

Concerns about disturbing any real life organizations, persons or whatsoever should be relieved since most of the ARG content seems to be fictional. It's worth noting though that *BigHit hasn't said anything official as of yet* aside for the Jungkook poster.",40,130,False,self,,,,,

The metrics a lot of us look at are:


*Youtube views

*domestic music charts and albums sold

*Spotify/Apple Music streams

*CF sponsorships

*concert tours



I think the last point is the largest piece of the pie by far, but is often forgotten when it comes to the merits of what a top tier group really is. I'll provide some examples. 



*SNSD's latest comeback didn't do well on the domestic charts, but they can still hold major tours all over Asia. Filling 50,000+ at the Tokyo Dome even after Jessica's departure is an incredible feat. 

*2PM may not be promoting much domestically, but in a recent Happy Together episode Junho admitted that the group were still the breadwinners for JYPE, not TWICE. 

*Bigbang's MADE tour grossed over 150 billion won two years ago, which converts into over $130 million. Let's not forget about Daesung's solo tours in Japan, GD's solo world tour, and Taeyang's current world tour as well. 


While veteran top groups may not win on music shows or achieve all-kills, a good number of them are still their respective companies' cash cows. This post was not intended to flame egos and rivalries. The only true rivalry I care about is the US market, which is still a major uphill battle overall. It's great to see hoobae groups like EXO, TWICE, BTS, etc gearing up to fully take the baton and take the popularity of kpop to the next level. ",10,3,False,self,,,,,

For me, I think i became a harsh critic out of necessity because there are so many groups out right now and i don't have time to be listening to all that music especially since i want to listen to music outside of kpop. So I use the one listen rule to tell whether i will like it or not. If not i never go back to it. I am even harsher to albums since they consume more time to listen to so when i hear two songs I'm not vibing with, i tend to skip the entire album. Of course i will listen to songs/albums from my bias groups more than once, but honestly kpop does not have a good track record with albums. There are only 5 albums i would rate above a 8. Only two of those are above a 9. 

For my biases, i find most ballads mediocre because most ballads have minimal production to give room for vocals. I also tend to stay away from Hip-Hop tinged groups since most kpop groups in my opinion don't do the genre justice. I also have a huge bias to SM groups since over the years SM continues to pump out groups with quality music. ",56,38,False,self,,,,,

So after his concert in Melbourne my friend and I decided to go to this Korean restaurant for supper. We were discussing GD's concert in a loud voice, talking about what we thought could improve the concert etc (but mostly fangirling about how awesome he was).

Then while being deep in discussion I noticed this guy(?) who looked really slender in the table in front of me and the first thing I noticed was that he was wearing the peaceminusone bucket hat with the long ass strap on it. Understandably my first reaction was wtf why would you wear this ugly-ass thing out in the streets. Then he started talking to the person beside him and turns out he's wearing a face mask which almost covered his eyes (between his hat and mask I couldn't even see his eyes) and the front of his bucket hat was filled with the bulldog clips from pmo too.

At this point I was suspecting that it's GD. But I didn't wanna be rash and dumb so I told my friend about it but she just said 'uh yeah that person dresses like gd' and seemed so nonchalant about it.

THEN I LOOKED TO HIS FEET and he was wearing the nike airs that's he endorsing. At this point I'm like wtf should I approach him. Obviously freaking out cos I was 85% sure that it's GD. The way he dressed and his mannerism, it's all so gd-like.

But I held back because I felt like I would be disturbing his privacy if I approached him. He was covered from head to toe so I doubt that he wanted people to recognise him. So I just kept staring at him from behind lol.

When he was leaving, I SAW THE TATTOO ON HIS NECK (the winged one) and at this point I was 100% sure that it's him. Then he just left :(

Half of me was scolding myself for not approaching him and half of me was glad that I gave him his privacy.

When i was exiting the restaurant I saw this Korean guy wearing the gd concert crew tag heading the same direction as GD(?) too so that like confirmed my suspicions even more.

Wanna post the pic I have but I feel like it's disrespectful to GD lol.

And now I'm still shaking from the encounter and wondering if I did the right thing. I also wonder if he overheard the crazy fangirling I did before I noticed him there lol.",40,222,False,self,,,,,

NEW SONG PLAYED BEFORE RELASE!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6tcnam/eric_nam_in_atlanta_ga_new_song_played_before/,JadeOlivia,1502591233,"  This is my first concert, and I didn't expect to be so physically and mentally exhausted. I apologize for any grammar/spelling as I'm on mobile!

The venue was a very intimate venue and was very personal, called ""Terminal West"", I was worried about getting a good spot, so I  stood in line for 4 hours. The doors opened at 7:00 and took about an hour for the opening act to start. Before it started, they played tons of famous kpop songs that the crowd sang and dance too. 

Alec Benjamin was the opening act, and it couldn't have been anyone more perfect. He was so sweet, and just an adorable puppy. His music is amazing! He was really interactive with the fans and sang a translated chorus of Blood, Sweat and Tears 

I was about 5 feet away from the stage, and had an awesome view. Eric started singing right away, and sang 10-12 songs, 3 with dancing. He played a lot of fan favorites: ""Cave Me In"", ""Good For You"", ""Who, You?"". 

**He sang a song that will release in about 10 days called ""Drop It""**. It was a very sexy, vibey song with a great drop to it! It was in English and so amazing! I expect a lot of uploads on YouTube of it (I will update my comment with the recording once I upload!). Since Atlanta is his hometown, he had a lot of his friends,teachers, and high school friends come to the show! 

He interacted with the fans and he sang happy birthday to the girls in the audience. Overall it was such a great experience. I totally recommend going to one of his shows, he is full of Charisma and just overall such an amazing guy. (The camera DOES NOT do him justice either!) 

If anyone has any more questions, feel free to ask! :)

- What (if any) are you sacrificing to go to this event?
- What are your expectations for our first Kcon?

Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts and opinions! Personally, I'm super hyped but I really wish the tickets were cheaper since many kpop fans have to pay for flights & accomodation to get there. Also, it would have been even more awesome if it wasn't timed so that most of the big artists are attending that event in Korea... but hey, I'm just grateful we're on the map haha  

P.S. I love this subreddit!",42,8,False,self,,,,,

It could be the vibe or the tone or the melodic structure, etc. 
For example:

Nu'est's [Big Deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0xYbdKAfl8) is a song I think would fit really well in VIXX's discography. It sounds a bit dark, has some clustered harmony structures, and some nice soaring notes I could easily hear Ken singing.

NCT Dream's [My First and Last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pUc7SD0PmU) has a similar flavor to SHINee's music. It would probably fit in really well on one of the Misconceptions Albums.

I know that a lot of this might come down to personal opinion, but I thought it also might be fun to see what everyone else thought, and that it might be a fun way to introduce new songs to each other that we'd probably like, but might not have heard before.",58,71,False,self,,,,,

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

#Group Beginnings 
 
The first public introduction to any members as Pledis Girlz was in 2013 on labelmate Seventeens predebut reality show 17tv where they jointly practiced and performed couple choreography to the song Call Me Maybe. Their first introductions can be seen [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=nx9gg918tck#t=2m18s) with Soyi (left at some point 2-3 years ago), Kyulkyung, Yebin, and Nayoung (Siyeon participated as well, but she's not in this video). On the show they showed the [joint dance practices between them and Seventeen](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G6KAf-f3-7w) (btw there are a lot of these, this one itself is 25 minutes) and eventually they [performed the piece at a showcase](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K8OiTZ6rUAI&amp;feature=youtu.be). At the same showcase they performed [Mannequin](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t2eOaLr7Pg8). Additionally, Eunwoo, Rena, and Kyulkyung appeared in Seventeens MV for [Mansae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M7k9ZV67c0). All of them have made numerous appearances in MVs. For example they all appeared in Orange Caramel's [Copycat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqSF_9Zf0n4) as backup dancers and Siyeon was the main actress for Nu'est's [I'm Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGmvS8SejY)



7 out of the 10 total members appeared on the reality competition Produce 101 with Siyeon, Yebin, Kyulkyung, Eunwoo, Kyungwon, Minkyung, and Nayoung participating while Kyla, Sungyeon, and Yewon abstained for various reasons. Their first performance on the show was a cover of After School's [Bang](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aEaWiBNZzq8&amp;feature=youtu.be) (which Siyeon rearranged herself) ([OT10 version](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oKoi2_PggpA&amp;feature=youtu.be)). Kyulkyung and Nayoung ended up making the final cut and becoming part of the temporary group IOI and promoted with them for 9 months before the groups disbandment. 

After Produce 101, Pledis Entertainment announced weekly concerts that would highlight members dancing, rapping, and vocal abilities that would be completely free to attend. (Note; Kyulkyung and Nayoung promoting with IOI made their presence at these concerts limited, and Siyeon sustained an ankle injury sat out on dance covers after the injury occurred) This went on for 15 weeks and then concluded with Bye and Hi, a full concert featuring all ten members where they revealed the official group name Pristin. A link to a steam of the entire concert can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZFwJCaPMJ4). In total throughout their concerts they covered nearly 60 different songs choreo,vocals, or both. Some notable examples being [Me Gustas Tu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_nxVO8Gck0), [Into the New World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTSYCLVfkPI), [Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWKiImB59Ic),  [Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F4qjhm5h20#t=1m05s), [Call Me Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0gqNdepJjQ) , and [Fox Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugrkmm9x47E). A spreadsheet with links to fancams of every performance can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IxLE0Hzl_-eFDNWsi23CFG_hAPE9AQ2T4xSF-UyCbdE/htmlview)

Additionally, the 8 members that weren't promoting with IOI released a song and music video entitled [We](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=9TMDWIy6-Jc) as a predebut single.

Pristins fanbase has two reliable subbing teams with Team lightbeam and Lady Teens International (who also serve as a international fanbase and page). TLB subs every vlive and appearance while LTI subs subs notable appearances and videos. Normally subs are completed incredibly fast within the day of the original airing. A spread sheet of every single sub by TLB is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/141LtoujF4bWzGklHlFfR-cqXCwoQqbemXA8h3MjVLHY/edit#gid=0) 

##Social Media Interaction

Pristin is incredibly active on their fancafe posting and replying to users, even using it as the place where fans could post suggestions for the fandom name and where they picked the name HIgh from. Additionally, their twitter account @10_Pristin regularly posts Selcas with short messages from the members and recently for the first time they used it to start randomly replying to fans and posting tweets. Also, Kyla's brother Luke is on twitter and interacts with fans sometimes. On vlives they regularly read comments and answer questions as well as other members occasionally posting comments during other member's individual vlives. Kyla even using him as a medium to interact with fans such as when he had her post [this letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6m8ra5/kyla_pristin_handwrites_a_letter_to_fans_after/) she wrote to fans.
 
 
 
#Hi! Pristin Promotions and Results
Pristin promoted Wee Woo and Black Widow together for the first week of promotions and then Wee Woo alone. They ended Wee Woo promotions after the second week of May and then after a one week break promoted Black Widow Vampire Version for one week. They came closest to a win on The Show where they placed second, only 16 points away from winning against EXID. Throughout their promotions they performed at various small concerts, as well as the Dream Concert and Kcon Japan.
 
The first week album sales of Hi! Pristin bordered on 12,000 copies which over tripled as promotions continued and as of now sits at just under 45 thousand copies sold which is not only great for a rookie girl group, but amazing for a girl group in general. The Wee Woo MV has garnered over 20 million views (combining both 1theK and Pristin's official channels views) and the dance practice over 3 million. While album sales and views were great, it could be argued the chart performance of Wee Woo lacked, peaking at around 49 on Melon and throughout the promotional period hanging around the 70-100 range which could be attributed to the mixed reactions people had to Wee Woo. Wee Woo also has nearly 160,000 digital sales. 
 
#Schxxl Out

I've been a kpop fan for quite some time now though I usually don't pay attention to wins/video views/ charting.
However, I'm planning on doing a project and I'm wondering how one would quantify the success of a kpop girl/guy group's debut or comeback?

Money/revenue is probably the easiest way to measure success, but from the outside with no access to most company's finances, how could we measure success? If I'm financing a group, do I care about Youtube views? Charting such as Gaon? Do billboard charts matter in SK? Music show wins? Also, which one is the most important?

I've done some research but I'd love to learn more about this, especially from South Korea's point of view.
Thanks!",11,20,False,self,,,,,

It was quite surreal to follow this group pre-debut and seeing them grow over the years and actually attend this concert. 

Setlist is [here](https://imgur.com/xx9fXdf), Ill highlight the memorable moments for me and talk about the VCRs since most people only had an audio stream

- First VCR we see little Yeri eating in a vibrantly colored room with two actors portraying her mom and dad. Shes trying to eat her meal, but the other members show up one by one pulling antics on her and her parents dont know whats going and tells her to ignore it. The members actions are seen like ghosts: Irene pops up behind the dad reading his newspaper, Seulgi cutely eating Yeris food (it shows up disappearing out of thin air until Seulgi is shown), Wendy following the mom around in the kitchen, and Joy was a portrait on the wall doing winks and stuff. The parents send Yeri to her room and she gets into bed. VCR cuts. 
- The stage is absolutely gorgeous. Its very theatrical and the props really show that were in Yeris room. A bed is on stage and its Yeri under the sheets! Members come out one by one in glittery outfits. First song begins. Concert opened up with Red Dress (holy fuck i died here, i almost cried out of sheer happiness). 
- In between Happily Ever After and Rookie, they set up personal cameras on stage. The girls did a lot of fan service into these cameras - hearts, waves, winks, etc. They got into formation for Rookie and everybody went fucking nuts. The first time hearing those fan chants in an auditorium filled with Reveluvs - something I will never forget. 
- VCR #2: Were watching all the members enjoy a really nice slumber party. Theyre watching movies, eating, playing games, taking photos, laughing, and smiling. Honestly so cute. VCR ends with Yeri picking up a phone and answering.
- Next set cues into Lady Room. Choreography includes phone props (call back to the VCR!!). Girls are wearing pajama-like robes (although mismatching colors cmon SM). Motif for these set of songs is slumber party-ish into a nail salon (Talk To Me, Dont U Wait No More).
- Oh Boy: god damn body rolls. oh boy indeed.
- Small talk break into next song, Yeri keeps saying pabo, pabo, pabo = Dumb Dumb
- Members greet themselves in first talk. Crowd goes wild. My left ear died because the girl next to me was screaming into my ear. its okay though, i was screaming into the person in front of me.
- During Campfire, Wendy got mesmerized by all the lightsticks and forgot her lyrics for a second. We all laughed. Their reactions were so cute. 
- During Campfire, they got off the main stage and walked around to the stage in the back (two stages set up in between the pit). Saw the members fairly up close since I was in the back of the pit. Joy was wearing this outfit that kinda revealed her back and I just had that in my face when they were doing the next set.
- Zoo choreography is so cute: its really as if theyre in a jungle of sorts exploring. 
- After Little Little, the bed comes back on the main stage and the members all get into the bed. Wendy leaves the bed. Wendy solo stage killed me she was so good. 
- After the lights went dark, I started hearing instrumental snippets of Be Natural. No fucking way. Members came out one by one in suits: they looked absolutely stunning (Seulgi &gt; Joy &gt; Yeri &gt; Irene was the order they came out). All the fans were going wild during this set when the members came out. The five member Be Natural chorus dance is legendary.
- Full versions of CHSL and Automatic. We were wary of the Automatic performance, but as soon as they went into the second verse everybody went wild. Full Automatic performance = also legendary.
- VCR # 3: All the members are shown they plotted the events that took place in VCR#2. It showed them in a way where they planned to have all those fun and games with Yeri. I dont really recall much from this VCR but thats what I got out of it. 
- Title track medley was awesome. Lots of theatrical streamers and confetti. Hearing all the fan chants were awesome. Russian Roulette - instead of the dance breakdown we got a cool remix version with laser sounds. I really wanted the fan chant here but oh well. 
- You Better Know had an EDM-like remix near the end. Also cool.
- Red Flavor: we all went wild, obviously. At Wendys last line, it included something with Reveluvs. Such a sweet ending to the main setlist. At this point the concert was already 1h40min long.
- Final VCR shows Yeri waking up in her room in a good mood. She finds the photos that she took with the other members, except she was the only one that appeared in the photos? Some voodoo stuff, then it closes off into a secret kind of thing as Yeri puts her finger over her mouth. really captures the idea of the Red Room concept. 
- Crowd chanted encore for like 4 minutes on and off. Girls came out to sing Candy, Yeri teared up near the end. 
- Happiness: lots of explosions. 
- Cool World ended the concert and I wouldnt have asked for any other song. Girls walked around the venue. Felt really intimate to see them do that.
- They said goodbyes, introduced their backup dancers and bowed. i love this group so much

thanks again for reading, it was quite long but there were so many great moments! im pretty tired from waiting in line all day so some parts might not be clear, but feel free to ask and ill try to clarify. ill be attending Sundays concert as well!

Hey r/kpop, I realized that KCON 2017 is just around the corner, which means that several redditors from this sub should be descending upon the beautiful city of Los Angeles reasonably soon. Since you will likely be staying near the Staples Center (unless you live close enough to make the drive daily), youll probably need to eat, and might want to explore the city a bit as well (especially Koreatown).

As an LA resident, I figured Id make a guide on things to do / places to go / things to eat while youre in LA, especially if you dont plan on being at the convention both days.

**The Public Transportation** - LA has two main forms of public transit: The Metro Rail and the Metro Bus. The Metro Rail system has a stop that's a 5 minute walk from the convention center / Staples center where KCON is being held. Easy to use, relatively cheap. It runs until midnight normally, and until 2AM on fridays and saturdays. 

Otherwise, driving your own car / a rental car is the way to go, or taking Uber/Lyft everywhere. I wouldn't recommend taking the bus, as I find it much more confusing and annoying, but if you're used to taking it in the city you're from, then more power to you.

#**To Eat:** 

**Walking Distance:**

* KCON LA has, in past years, arranged to have food trucks and a few stands outside, near the staples center at Chick Hearn Court, where you can buy food. This is by far the easiest/closest option, and is definitely your best bet if you want to get back to the convention ASAP. 
* **Original Pantry Cafe** - Might get some flak here from other LA natives, but Pantry cafe is a classic. Serves pretty standard American diner food, but it's an LA icon, and it's right across the street from the LA Live / Staples center complex. roughly a 5-10 minute walk from the convention center.
* **Broken Spanish ($$)** - Upscale modern Mexican restaurant by Ray Garcia. Really good, but it comes with a price to match. Expect to pay at the very minimum, $25-30 after tax &amp; tip per person, would not be surprised if it came out to $50+. You can read a review by LA Times [here](http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-broken-spanish-20151017-story.html)
* **Faith &amp; Flower ($$)** -  Upscale restaurant serving ""California French"" cuisine. Essentially, modern, international food prepared using primarily french cooking styles and local California ingredients. Similarly priced to Broken Spanish. LA Times review [here](http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-broken-spanish-20151017-story.html)

**Short Metro Ride / Driving Distance**

KCON LA has the fortune to be held right next to downtown, and also very close to the Expo rail line, allowing a lot of people, even those without cars, to reach quite a few places easily. Uber and Lyft are also good options here.

* **Grand Central Market** - Big food hall in downtown, just a few metro rail stops away. Parking is $2-3 dollars for the first 90 minutes, but ramps up quickly afterwards. Several great places here, popular options include Eggslut, Belcampo, Horse Thief, Prawn and Wexlers Deli. Honestly, everything here is quite good, and it's pretty hard to go wrong. Sari Sari and Madcapra I believe are also very recent additions from famous chefs, so those might be worth checking out.
* **Chichen Itza / Holbox** - Technically two separate restaurants, but in the same food court, and run by the same chef. Yucatecan Mexican food by Gilberto Centina Jr. in the USC area a bit south of the convention center. It's 2-3 metro rail stops away, so also very accessible. Review by LA Times for Holbox [Here](http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-holbox-review-20170313-story.html)
* **Other Options** - LA also has other great restaurants nearby, but they are too many to write in-depth about. A quick list: Birdies, Baco Mercat, Spring, PYT, Ledlow, Drago Centro, Sonoratown, Little Sister, Engine Co. 28, Perch. Be sure to check prices before going, costs of dining can very quickly skyrocket in downtown LA if you aren't careful!

**Koreatown**

The metro rail also runs to Koreatown via the Purple line (and the red line, for a single stop). However, this can be fairly limiting in where you go, as Koreatown is very large. Taking a Uber or Lyft is recommended if you need to walk more than a few blocks, especially at night. Driving is also viable, valet parking is almost universally $2 here. 

Easily the best place to get Korean food in the United States, and arguably one of the best outside of Korea itself. Make sure you have cash handy, some restaurants don't take card!

**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT KOREAN RESTAURANTS: A lot of the workers here are immigrant workers, often trying to make a living and raise children in LA. However, service standards and expectations in Asia are very different than in the U.S. Most Korean patrons simply want their order and the check, and that is their only interaction with the wait staff.**

**You will almost never find waiters and waitresses asking if you want more water or another drink or how your day was. You will be left alone. If you want anything, flag down a waiter or waitress, or many restaurants have call buttons conveniently placed on the table that will send a signal to the front of house, and they will send wait staff down to you to ask you for what you need.**

**Please, please, PLEASE do not leave a nasty review on Yelp because of this, or because the parking situation was terrible. Parking everywhere in LA, ESPECIALLY Koreatown, is terrible, and bad Yelp reviews have a very real impact on restaurants and the livelihood of the workers there. Please carefully consider before you leave a poor review.**

* **Sun Nong Dan** - very popular 24-hour Korean restaurant in the heart of Ktown, you can find people here nearly all hours of the day. Likely will be a line here when you arrive. The food is great, recommend getting the galbi jjim (spicy beef rib stew) or the sullungtang (beef bone broth with noodles). Walking distance from Wilshire/Vermont and Wilshire/Normandie stations.
* **Jun Won** - also a great Korean restaurant, does fish dishes especially well
* **Jinsol Gukbap** - Great option for gukbap (soup with rice), dwaeji galbi (marinated grilled pork ribs) and naengmyun (cold/iced noodles).
* **Kobawoo** - THE place to go for Bossam (boiled pork belly wraps), and haemuljun (seafood pancakes) Walking distance from Wilshire/Vermont
* **77Kentucky** - Massive portions of great Korean-style fried chicken. Walking distance from Wilshire/Vermont
* **El Pollo A La Brasa** - Fantastic Peruvian rotisserie chicken. Walking distance from Wilshire/Western.
* **BCD Tofu House** - Gonna get a lot of flak from LA Koreans for this one too, but it has absolutely massive seating space if you have a large party, and really, really easy parking with reasonable prices. You're here for the soondubu (spicy tofu stew). Walking distance from Wilshire/Normandie.
* **Chun Ju Han Il-Kwan** - Great little spot for Budaejjigae (""army stew"", really just an amalgamation of spam, other meat, rice cake and vegetables in a spicy stew). Walking distance from Wilshire/Normandie and Wilshire/Vermont
* **Pot** - Also going to get a lot of flak for this one. Run by Roy Choi (the guy who runs the famous Korean Taco trucks), it's in the Line Hotel. Serves a wide variety of Korean soups and stews. Is THE place to go if you are expecting better service, typical of what you get at an American restaurant. The waiters here also all speak fluent English, so if you aren't comfortable dealing with wait staff that might not speak English well, this is the place to go. They can also explain the menu very well, which certainly helps if this is your first experience with Korean food.
* **Guelaguetza** - Fantastic Oaxacan Mexican restaurant in southern Koreatown. Moles are fantastic.
* **Myeong Dong Kyoja** - My favorite place for kalguksu (noodle soup) and mandu (dumplings). Big portions at low prices, really consistent food. Great place overall.
* **Here's Looking at You ($$)** - One of the hottest new restaurants in LA. Beautifully prepared, fresh takes on Los Angeles cuisine by Jonathan Whitener and Lien Ta. Definitely place a reservation beforehand, and be prepared for the price (at least $35 a person, easily north of $50) LA Times review [here.](http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-fo-gold-review-heres-looking-at-you-20161026-story.html) 
* **Beverly Soondubu** - My personal preference for soondubu over BCD, but it's much smaller and definitely can't cater to large groups as well.
* **Yu Chun** - Go-to place for many Korean-Americans for naengmyun (cold noodles). Perfect for a hot summer day.
* **Cassell's** - Classic burger join in Koreatown. Some people consider it on the pricier end for a burger (around $10 iirc) but I find it well worth the price.


**Korean Barbeque**

This is, by FAR the most requested thing that friends from out of town ask me to take them to - regardless of whether they are into Korean culture / Kpop or like Asian food, it seems that KBBQ in LA has made a name for itself around the world. As a result, it gets a separate category on this list. Expect to pay upwards of $20 for most places if you want decent quality meat, $15 is generally the bare minimum to get something good.

* **Parks BBQ ($$)** - More or less THE place for top-shelf korean barbeque, with a price to match. Pretty much every K-Pop celebrity that has been to LA has probably eaten here, including 2NE1, Tiffany, Astro, Monsta X (and many many more, I just can't remember them all off the top of my head). If you want to catch a celebrity sighting, this is probably the most likely place, but I still wouldn't get your hopes up. The food is absolutely fantastic, but it can easily run you north of $40.
* **Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong** - A relatively recent transplant from Korea, by comedian/variety personality Kang Hodong. Great cuts of meat, in an awesome, if a bit raucous, atmosphere. However, it can have serious lines, especially on a friday/saturday night, so be aware.
* **Ahgassi Gopchang** - This one is a personal favorite, but is not for everybody. It's a place that specializes in gopchang (intenstines) and they do them really, really well. However, if you like entrails and offal, this is the place to be. Walking distance from Wilshire/Normandie and Wilshire/Western
* **Oo Kook** - One of the best All You Can Eat (AYCE) KBBQ in Ktown in my opinion. Roughly $25-35 a person before drinks. 
* **MaGal BBQ** - New Korean BBQ contender on the block, cranking out some quality food. Very popular, like Kang Ho Dong, so be prepared to wait during peak times.

**Places to avoid** - Personally, I'm not a fan of these places, because they consistently fail to put out quality food, or have switched owners so often that quality can vary wildly.
**Bud Namu, Castle BBQ (or Castle II), O Dae San, Hae Jang Chon**


**Farther away**
The LA dining scene in recent years has rapidly expanded, and has made some pretty great restaurants. Unfortunately, many are farther away than Koreatown or Downtown, and I don't want to make this post longer than it already is. If anybody is interested, I can definitely add it in the comments, but I'll leave it empty for now.

#To-Do

LA in general, and Koreatown specifically, is probably one of the few places where you will get multiple stores selling KPop merchandise. There are three that I myself frequent, but I'm sure more will come up on Yelp. In addition, there are usually one or two booths on the convention floor in KCON LA that is selling CD's and other merch, but usually the store itself will have a larger selection.

I'm not sure what other people would be interested in doing besides eating, so please let me know if I'm missing something!

* **Music Plaza** - My go-to store. I don't do direct price comparisons, but this store definitely has the widest selection. I've found relatively obscure things like the SNSD Heart to Heart compilation CD, or random LABOUM albums here. They always have the latest albums in stock, on my last visit I noticed Holiday Night, The Red Summer, Our Twenty For, Hola Hola, and more there. Prices always seem competitive, and they have those massive collectible albums / concert albums for sale there too.

 I'm not much of a poster/calendar buyer, but they seem to have a pretty good selection. You can also find those fanclub lights (is that what they are called?) here as well. There's also a good collection of older Korean singers here, like Lena Park, Younha, Lee Moon Sae, etc. 

 It's a relatively small storefront in the Koreatown Plaza mall on Western, so parking is easy, and it's not TOO far of a walk from the Wilshire/Western metro station. I believe they also have a booth at KCON, but the selection is obviously more limited there.

* **Choice Music** - Another very popular K-Pop store. Definitely more clean/modern than Music Plaza, but I find that they have less variety of albums in stock, as they only tend to keep most things around a few years back at most. However, if you are looking for an album that was released recently, they are guaranteed to have it, and every single variety of it, available. Prices are very competitive, and they seem to have a wide variety of other merch here as well. 

 As an added bonus, they frequently will have pre-order goodies for you, even if you aren't pre-ordering an album. As an example, when I bought TWICEcoaster: Lane 2 from them, they also gave me the little packet of wallet-sized member photos that came with pre-orders, even though I never pre-ordered the album, and I was probably at least a week late in buying the album. 

 It's in the Koreatown Galleria on Olympic and Western, which is a pretty far walk from any train lines. There should be a bus line that runs nearby, but the best option is probably just to uber/lyft there. If you have a car, there is a parking structure attached to the mall, so parking is nice and easy.

* **Aladdin Used Books** - I really wanted to keep this off the list, as it's borderline not even really a kpop store. It's a used bookstore of Korean books. However, they have a CD section where they sell new and used Korean music CD's. They have a huge variety, I've gotten older albums from Epik High or Peppertones or S.E.S here, but they also carry some of the newer stuff. Sometimes you can get an album for quite a bit less than its retail price, if you don't mind it already being opened.

* **3rd Street Promenade** - Probably the most popular shopping area in LA. Easily accessible by Metro rail from the Staples Center/Convention center, it's also right next to the famous Santa Monica pier (that pier with the ferris wheel and small roller coaster on it). You can find a ton of your usual American clothing stores in and around 3rd street promenade, in case you needed/wanted clothes or accessories to wear since you forgot something at home. 

 It's roughly a 30-45 minute ride on the train to here, and roughly the same time by car. I recommend using the train because parking in Santa Monica is both annoying and expensive.

* **CGV Cinemas** - One of the few Korean-language theatres in the states, it's located across the street from Wilshire/Western station. Currently showing A Taxi Driver and The Battleship Island, both should have English subtitles. 

* **The Face Shop** - There are several makeup stores scattered around Koreatown, probably one of the most popular is The Face Shop. There's one in the CGV Cinemas courtyard across the street from the Wilshire/Western Station

* **Hwa Sun Ji** - Technically, this is something to eat/drink, but it's an experience in my opinion too. It's probably the only traditional tea house in Koreatown, and you'll see people of all ages coming here. The teas are obviously quite good, and the shaved ice is amazing as well. Walking distance from the purple line.

* **Okrumong** - Another shaved ice place in Koreatown, also very good. Walking distance from the purple line.

#To Drink

I understand that not all of you are drinking age in America. For those of you who aren't I recommend **Boba Time** in Koreatown on 6th Street and Alexandria if you want boba / bubble tea / pearl milk tea. **Document Cafe** and **Space E.Um Cafe** (full disclosure, I'm friends with the owner) are also personal favorites of mine if coffee is more your thing, and all are within walking distance of the Purple line train stops. **Coffee Colab / No Ghost Bears** is also a great little coffee shop on the southern end of Downtown LA. As a bonus, Space E.Um and Boba Time sometimes play KPop, so it's a fun little game to see what songs you recognize.

However, for those of you who are of drinking age and are going to KCON, you're in luck. The bar / brewery scene in LA has massively improved over the years. Some personal favorites:

* **Mikkeler LA** - Probably the closest bar to KCON LA. A 15 minute walk from the Staples Center, although taking Uber/Lyft will probably make your life easier. Heavily beer-focused, with over 50(!!!) beers on tap. They also have some wines on tap, and make a few cocktails. Has a very solid food menu as well, and a coffee shop open during the daytime. If you're a beer person, you can't go wrong going here.

* **Everson Royce Bar** - Probably one of the most popular bars in LA, and for good reason. Absolutely amazing cocktails, good food, and great beer. Insanely extensive selection of straight liquor as well, if scotch/whiskey/bourbon etc is more your thing. A relatively short hop away from the convention center by car or uber/lyft.

* **Beer Belly** - Great craft beer place in Koreatown. Walking distance from the purple line. Food is average in my opinion, but it has a great, constantly rotating selection of local craft beers on tap.

* **Gaam** - Very popular korean fusion bar in Koreatown, right next to Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong. Decent fusion food, good variety of cocktails, walking distance from the purple line. 

* **Mama Lion Supper Club** - Newly opened bar/restaurant in Koreatown. Haven't tried the food yet, but the cocktail/beer selection was solid. There is a dress code, so come prepared for that. Walking distance from the purple line.

* **OB Bear** - Classic Koreatown bar. You're definitely here for the beer (specifically the Korean OB Lager) and the fried chicken. About as ""authentic"" as a Koreatown experience as you can get. Walking distance from the purple/red line.

* **Birds &amp; Bees** - Nice little underground cocktail bar in downtown. Has a small beer selection as well.

* **The Slipper Clutch** - Nice retro-themed cocktail bar in downtown. Fairly popular as of late.

* **Spire 73** - Currently the title holder of ""America's tallest open air bar"". Great views of downtown from the rooftop bar 73 floors up, you can find it in the brand new Wilshire Grand building. 

* **Arts District Brewing Co.** - Beer brewery in Arts District. Very popular.

* **Mumford Brewing** - Beer brewery in Little Tokyo, personal favorite of mine.

* **Angel City Brewery** - Beer brewery in Arts District.

* **Boomtown Brewery** - Beer brewery in Arts District. Focuses on mostly lighter beers and pale ales/IPA's it feels like. They have some pool tables and other spaces to play games.

* **Iron Triangle Brewery** - Beer brewery in Arts District.

Wow, this got really long really fast. Let me know if any of you guys have questions, or would like to know more about something specific! As an LA native, I want r/kpop to love the city as much as I do, and experience the best of what it has to offer. KCON LA is going to be great!

It's inevitable that with such an oversaturated market, groups need to find ways to stand out. Music is a great way of doing that. Fans in turn follow groups for certain styles of music and groups continue to fill that niche when they stick to the same sound. In addition, every comeback is a big investment and it makes sense to stick to a more reliable investment. For example, Dreamcatcher is a group that absolutely should stick to their concept because no one else is doing it. 

On the other hand, this really limits a group in what they can do. GFriend gets hate for having songs that sound similar but then their sales suffer after changing their concept for Fingertip. If a group falls behind trends or can't capitalize on their momentum, then they become one hit wonders. EXID has managed to stay relevant thanks to LE continuing to incorporate new elements into their music even while keeping some things the same. 

What do redditors think? Do you like everyone having their own style of music, even if it gets repetitive? Or would you prefer if groups could experiment more musically?",60,117,False,self,,,,,

I've seen just how popular those examples are in Korea.

When I think of current day K-pop, I think of groups always pushing themselves to outdo the current best. Music videos are huge budget projects; idols' make-up and clothing, the music video's props, setting, lighting, editing... Everything is specifically done to be as appealing to the viewer as possible. The more perfect the end product is on release, the faster the views rack up, the more people flock to the video (kpop youtube twitter stan culture, whatever you want to call it) and the song hopefully becomes a hit.

Recently, I was thinking about BLACKPINK's newest music video. The views have been astronomical and the comments typically comment on how amazing (scalped, shook, invented ice cream etc) the music video, and in turn song, is. Then, I think back to when they released ""Playing with Fire"" and ""Stay"". Both songs/music videos did quite well in terms of views and reception, but here I am thinking, could they have done the same thing by releasing only ""Stay"". As in, not a single with a B-side song, just ""Stay"" by itself. 

And that brings me to the discussion for this thread. Looking back at what I've typed I don't think I've done a very good job explaining myself, but I feel like kpop has continuously been building itself up into this hype machine, where every new single has to be flawless, in your face, powerful (oh, I forgot about choreography! faster songs usually have quicker/more interesting to look at dance moves) and we've somehow gotten to this strange place where a ballad is just not going to cut it as a solitary release for a next single. 

What do you guys think? Feel free to expand on how you feel about ballads in today's kpop, or even comment on current trends or what kind of direction K-pop has been heading towards recently. I'd love to hear what r/kpop thinks!",42,67,False,self,,,,,

However, being able to imitate the dance moves doesn't make it look good.
I don't expect my movements to be as smooth like those of a professional who practised every day for half his life right away but I started to wonder what the actual content of the dancing lessons are K-Pop trainees have to go through.

It is probably not much different from what is taught in Hip-Hop lessons around the world but I would like to know if there is something else to practise besides simply learning and improve executing various choreographies/dance-moves.",14,40,False,self,,,,,

The notice went up Friday afternoon so after work (which ended at 6 pm) I sprinted to the station as fast as I could and got myself to the DMC in order to get on the list. I'm glad I did. Since this was the first weekend of promotions, the list was going to be insane number wise. I got my highest check in number ever (668). I was just praying inside that I would get the fancard at least. I then sprinted over to Myeongdong and got my album for the weekend. (I got a Renjun photocard. Now to get another album and get a Jeno photocard...cause reasons.) Went home, got everything ready for the am, watched Ennana and then slept for like 5 hours. 

Since I just moved to Seoul, I have to memorize a new route to get there. The DMC, which is where MuCore is shot, is on the opposite side where I live, even though it's on the same side of the river. I took my train, got there early enough and I'm glad I did. The NCT List Girls have been creating twitter accounts to give us updates about the notice and when things will officially start. The ball started rolling around 9 am when we got into our lines. The official total of numbers given out was a little over 851 before the notice was taken down. X Line (the nickname I have given to those who did not get to the notice in time or showed up the day of) was huge today. Just huge. It kinda became a horseshoe in shape. The reason why it was so crazy today: it was the first day to get the new fancard. 

Check in with the supporters began around 9:40 am instead of 10 am and it was a good thing. They gave us our ranks and we waited. They started to give numbers and fancards to some of the lines. But then they announced that they were moving us to the venue and putting us in our tier lines and give out fancards there. We all left in an unorganized mess since generally we put our tier lines together by our check in spot and then walk over there together but not today really. The girls next to me were really nice and since everything was a slight mess they made sure our area of the line got in the correct order. [A fandom that helps each other stays together, kids.] 

Since we were over there for a long while, we had time to actually practice the fan chant together. It was a pretty simple fan chant and we all laughed when we started it because the first NCT Dream chant was right before they started singing. While this was happening, those in the lower tiers got their fan cards and were told to leave since they wouldn't be able to get in. The lines all by me were the ones who would for sure get in. At MuCore they love to pack as many people as possible that first weekend. Since the fandom is getting much bigger each comeback, they're sort of making N1 [the highest tier] a priority for getting in. Those who would be standing got their mini posters while we were waiting to be let in. Then, we were told to stand up and we went in.

I was sitting in the last row in the center so I was able to see everything. There were people standing behind us in two rows, people sitting on the stairs, the people who got into standing and some people were even on the floor in front of the seats. Like I said, they really like to pack us in here.

Now, let's talk We Young. I'll talk about Jeno and Mark a little more in depth towards the end.

This song really confirmed that Dream is my favorite of the units so far. It's their energy really. They feed off the energy we give them. We like to scream a lot when the kids come on stage. They can breathe and we scream. We're a very loud fandom when it comes to that but I think it's the enthusiasm. Dream's concept is to be a unit that gives people hope with their youthful image and they really do. 

Dream did one rehearsal and three (???) takes. At the start of the rehearsal, Mark led the greeting and how he said ""NCT"" sounded like ""N City."" They wore their little lost boy pirate outfits and we were all jdkbhjkfhjekhhdsjk. At the start of the rehearsal, Mark made a sound to get the boys in place better and we all screamed. We went off with the fan chant during the rehearsal. We were just so loud. 

After the rehearsal take, playback started and we screamed really loud. That was when the PD-nim told us to be quiet in the studio. We all said a very quiet ""Ne"" and that lasted...for a bit. I don't know why but when it comes to Dream, we scream even watching playback. 

The choreo for this song is just perfect for them. It's so cute and adorable. It's so...fluid. It moves like a perfectly matched sequence. There are some choreos that are done for groups and places feel out of place. Not with this song. Every movement has a reason. Seriously it is a perfect choreo for them. For example, this choreo literally makes Renjun be so fairy like. He's just so elegant and this choreo really showcases that. 

There were so many screams for China Line. I swear everyone was Chenle and Renjun biased. Of course Mark got so many screams as did Haechan. Dream really is the unit that lets him shine. He just owns the stage in every aspect. And his vocals. This is when you cry over the lack of lines for Haechan in 127. He is a king when he is in Dream. 

We also screamed when Jisung and Jeno both had their raps. Jisung was just so happy to be able to rap. His dedication to Taeyong hyung is paying off ~~I'm not crying what do you mean????~~ I swear. Before the first take, the camera suddenly went to Jeno. Mark was touching his hair and Jeno turned around and we all screamed so loud. Jeno looked so shocked. ""Why are you screaming at me?"" And Renjun from his position shrugged. Chenle was also so adorable today. He was Prince of China-ing it up. I swear. That kid knows he is all that and we let him know that. And Jisung is so tall now. He's growing so fast and soon he's gonna be as tall as Johnny. And he's still a baby. ~~Stop growing up please.~~ 

Now, let's talk about Jeno. He is a bias wrecker in training, like Jaehyun. All of a sudden, he became the center for most of this song. He is such a visual as well. He might actually be my Dream bias??? I'm very confused right now. Please send help. But he's starting to show this confidence with his ability right now and he's going to be a force to reckon with. And his rap was so good. I think both he and Jisung know that they need to work on their rap because Mark is leaving soon. 

Now, Mark Lee is NCT's busiest member. He has been working constantly since April 2016 and probably before that. He is such a good leader for Dream. The kids listen to him and just dote on him. Everyone knows that this is most likely the last promotions with Mark and it's really sad. With Dream, you get to see this different side of Mark and it's this wonderful supportive hyung. He's the one in control. When he leaves, Jeno will probably be taking over the raps. And when Jeno leaves, it will be Jisung. 

There's been a lot of talk withing fandom circles online about the graduation system here. This first generation of Dreamies is wonderful and I am sure the other generations will be as well. But these boys just fit so well together. When they graduate the group, it's gonna be sad for so many of the fans. But these kids will be able to shine when they debut in other NCT units when the time comes. I just love the Dreamies so much and like most of the fanbase, they need to be protected at all costs. They are just so young. 

After the last take, Mark thanked us for coming and said that it was just the first week of promotions but they will continue to work hard. They left the stage and we all left the room as fast as we could so other groups could get their prerecs done. We then got in line with our numbers again and were given the [mini poster]
(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHkVLrYVwAE9U6X.jpg). I then got my fan card and left.[ The first fan card is the old one and the new one is right under it](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHkVUr4VoAIZ0eh.jpg). 

Overall, it was such a wonderful recording. Dream really is the most popular unit in NCT. No one knew what to expect when they debuted almost one year ago. But now, they really are that unit. They are very public friendly with both song choice and concept. But I also think it's because of how young they are, people want them to succeed. I just love NCT Dream so much.

Hello, this is Jellyfish Entertainment.

We are posting in regards to a forum posted yesterday (August 19th).

There were many personal attacks made in the comments towards our artists. The comments were in forms of malicious rumours as well as false claims. We are writing this notice to clarify the situation.

The photos in questions do not suggest what has been rumoured in terms of our artists blocking time to meet with fans intimately, this was never the case of what occurred.

During busy schedules between rehearsals, a fan had met one of the members who was rushing to practice.

The photo in questioning was taken during the time where the two were greeting each other and it was difficult to sanction the fan. Please do not over analyze the situation of what it is and please stop with the personal attacks and negative comments.

Furthermore, the support of fans have already been discussed and was address already on November 24th, 2016 in the fanclub, during this date, the fan had been removed from the fansite but applied using someone else's name to apply for the support. We will be more cautious in regards to the checking with more details for future supports.

Once again, we would like to remind everyone that we will take legal action against malicious comments, defamations and spreading of these contents regarding our artists. 

------------


For those unaware, there have been pictures making rounds around the internet of VIXX's Leo walking with another girl and they look quite intimate as they are closely together.

There has been one specific forum on Nate that identifies the girl to be the owner of a fansite who is the same individual from an incident back in early November last year. [More info here](https://redd.it/5es1fb). She has since been removed from the official fanclub and fansite according to Jellyfish. In the forum individuals are slandering Leo for having a special relationship with his fans and giving preferential treatment as well as rumours that the two are in a relationship all of which Jellyfish has denied.",19,73,False,self,,,,,

I flew all the way from Boston over here because of Wanna One and GOT7. I got a P1 combo aiming at trying to get many passes/ possibly picking up a Wanna one or GOT7 hitouch. KCON being the bitch that they are decided to not do it the usual way. Instead, we have to buy merchandise in exchange for a chance at W1's hitouch. Thursday (8/17) was uneventful because it was lining up to get passes for the most part. I checked in for my friend and we ended up with two GOT7 hitouches (lucky us). So our hunt for GOT7's hitouch is officially over. However, our hunt for W1's hitouch has officially started.

**Convention Day 1**: Day 1 is pretty uneventful as well for the most part. KCONLA sure has better food compared to KCON NY. There were a lot of giveaways. They had Heize over at Star Square so we decided to visit and take a look. She was a cutie. She winked and give out hearts to her fans. Her pink/purple-ish makeup matches her hair. Overall, Heize looks like a truly unique unicorn.  Other than that, I was snooping for W1's hitouch. If you guys have not heard, 2 crazy fansites ordered $1000 worth of merchandise (merch) and made KCon ran out of merch for the raffle. People were disheartened.


**Convention Day 2**: we make sure to arrive extra early (at 8:00) to try our hand at W1's hitouch chance again. Unfortunately, we were at the cut-off point. Day 2 is more fascinating as there were many booth visits. Magically we ended up near VIXX's booth vist over in Toyota. When we saw that they were setting up line for VIXX's entrance. We decided to stand close to that line instead of the stage. It was worth it as we did not have to zoom in but was still able to film Ken's very elegant and high nose :). (video will be added later). I did not attend any other booth so feel free to chime in.

**Concert Day 1**: Out of the lineup, I am most excited about SJ D&amp;E (sorry I am an old soul). SJ D&amp;E did a really good job of hyping up the crowd. I was really impressed by their english since the last time I saw them was 7 years ago and they only spoke Korean. They spoke in full sentences saying how they missed us a lot (aww). Girls' Day is one of my favorite girl group and I was lowkey happy about her new relationship :). However, I feel like their outfits did not match the songs so it made the performance a bit less interesting to me. Something is not the same without feather on the hands and matching black dresses. VIXX was really impressive - I have always been fond of Shangri La and their fan choreography. They moved so smoothly and Leo really slayed the vocal. Everyone was of course very hyped for Seventeen. I already know that Hoshi will not be there (cause I read this reddit, duh). The stage is really impressive and it made me feel like I should look more into Seventeen (I only know their title tracks).

**Final Convention Day**: We lined up extra early for W1's hitouch chance again. This time, at 5:00 AM. Let me just say that Wannables are crazy. I might be one of them but I know we are crazy. Once bag check started people ran to the door without getting their bag checked. I did get a chance this time but I got nothing :(. I was beaten down but I felt like trying my luck again. However, I put my purse in my frend's bag so she stood in line instead. It was the best decision ever as we got 2 hitouch passes after going back in line for the 5th time. Wanna One came by Innisfree at 12:00 so it was a security mess. KCON threatened multiple times that they will stop the event if people keep misbehaving. However, it was time for GOT audience engagement so I did not see Wanna one at Innisfree. It was a mess because a fansite tried to sneak in with the people who won photo-op and pretended to actually win one. She got kicked out by security, as she should be.

**GOT7's fan engagement** The room was packed. Fans were chanting along to songs on the screen. It seems like most fans are IGOT7xWannables like me, so the singing/ chanting were the loudest when Energetic and Never Ever came on. GOT7 came on and they were like themselves- really extra as usual. Everyone's hair was really nice. Mark's red hair looks refreshing. I am on the fence about Yugeom's hair since it seems like his hair is severely damaged. Jinyoung did twerk a bit and the room was shook. When going on the hitouch, everything was a blur. My vote goes to Jinyoung for having the softest and warmest hand. He seems to hold hand a bit longer too, which is why I appreciate him even more. The line ended with Jackson and he gave me the cutest smile ever when I told him 'Wang Puppy'.

**Wanna-One hitouch**: we were smart enough to figure out the lines so we were the first five to hitouch Wanna One. They lined up the people for hitouch so we were first row, the closest to Wanna One. I was shocked when they came out. Everyone looked like a prince out of a manhwa (especially my man Minhyun). I totally get the hype about Daniel as his eye makeup makes him look so mysteriously handsome. They were still very annoyed because they were probably mobbed on the way here too. Hitouch went by fast but I could remember Jisung very well because we did the Jisung clap together and he held both of his hands over mine.

**Final Concert day**: This lineup is the reason why I am here. Mark and Jackson were the MC for the majority of the time. Wanna One was only the MC in the end. The stage began with KARD. Everyone was hyped as most of them probably have listened to Don't Recall/ Hola Hola/ Oh Nana. They were very playful on the stage, joking and running around. We sang the birthday song to Somin and she was on the verge of crying. I believe Heize came after them and she sang her latest singles smoothly. Then a message appeared on the board that asked us to turn our flashlights on instead to create stars for her, everyone followed. Heize was so touch she could not hold it in. I truly live for fanxidol interaction like this. Wanna One came out and everyone went nuts. Watching Energetic was surreal as they really put in all their energy for the performance. When they danced to Burn It Up it was facing us so I get to see Daniel flashing his abs at the audience very clearly. Astro performed after them, with the legendary Kim Tae Woo was that. I have never listen to Astro but they seemed very refreshing. Then Wanna One performed 'Never' and 'Pick Me'. Sadly, I see butts and backs mostly. However, it made me really happy as 'Never' has been my jam for the summer. They dressed up in navy uniforms which really suited them. When Wanna One finished their performance, NCT came one. I really love the white costumes since the ones in KCON NY were .... terrible. My bias Johnny is tall so I can see him in any corner. Taeyong's charisma is really something, which explains why he is always in the center. The show closed with GOT7 and the whole audience was ready to scream their lungs out. Yugeom's little dance part was excellent as usual as he has extraordinary command of the stage. The crowd is what makes Kcon exciting, and people were dancing/ chanting to every single line of every song. I was so happy that the boys are well-appreciated by fans. 

**Miscellaneous**: I saw and talked to a lot of youtubers when they came in starbucks. Starbucks is truly the place to be. When I was in NY I met Kevin Woo on the way to Starbucks as well.

Please share your experience with me. This has been a long post and it has been a long day so photos will be added later :)",45,67,False,self,,,,,

- You see live, the performers don't hit their dance moves as hard as they do in the videos. They are pacing themselves, they are singing live, and you can really see them concentrating to make sure they don't mess up.
- I thought Cosmic Girls' I Wish was one of the highlights. The instrumental track and tone of that song just matched the festive, excited atmosphere inside the Staple Center so well. 
- Sojin had never really stood out before but she was really charming. She did most of the heavy lifting for Girls' Day in terms of engaging the crowd and she seemed really happy to be in LA. Yura, one my top 10 visual faves, seemed cool, too. Hyeri was physically the most demonstrative, waving a lot, kind of quirky. Minah seemed icy. 
- Seventeen really put on a show. Their level of performance was a notch or two above everybody else's. 
- KARD. Second time seeing them in LA. The crowd sang happy birthday to Somin and she started crying. For whatever reason, despite really buff and tall for a Kpop star, I just don't get the feeling that the ladies like Big Matthew. 
- Heize started crying when so many people obliged her request to turn on their phone flashlights for Star. She is one of the most likable people in Kpop. She was getting a great response from the crowd. 
- NCT 127. Like Seventeen the night before, probably the most energetic, exuberant performers of the day. When they were introducing themselves, one of the guys was visibly nervous as heck talking, his right hand, keeping his mic in place, was shaking like crazy.
- GOT 7. Second time seeing them, this time they were the last act.  They were doing some variety show stuff at some point, the camera was supposed to look for some girls for Jackson to hug, and two girls who were shown on screen about 5 times that night for whatever reason got chosen. In general, seemed like Jackson was really popular with the LA crowd.
- Wanna One. The girls around me were losing their shit whenever Daniel Kang was on the jumbotron. Maybe because they hadn't been training together for 5 years, on a few of their songs, their choreography looked very simple compared to the stuff the other male groups were doing. 
- Astro. Second time seeing them, too. One of the guys on Astro (it was Rocky) was a true dancing machine, seemingly up there with the likes of Kai and Taemin. Seventeen and NCT-17 brought a lot swag and energy to their performances, but I almost think Astro might have been performing the most technically difficult routines. 

When the performers said they were so thrilled to be in LA, I believed them. If I was at Kcon NYC, I would believe them, too. I guess one of the great things about living in LA is that people are actually a bit in awe of Hollywood, the world comes here, and they try their best. On the way in, saw a few of the guys from Classical Music Reacts series. They couldn't get in for whatever reason, there seemed to have been some misunderstanding. But they stood right outside waiting for it to be cleared up. 

edit: It was interesting to see people on the Red Line train to and from the concert and knowing for sure they were going to Kcon or just came out of Kcon.  

edit: Main reason I posted this was because I wanted to read what other people thought. ",90,112,False,self,,,,,

2454,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-8-22,2017,8,22,16,6v9ihg,self.kpop,Which choreography best showcases or represents each member of the groups you follow?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6v9ihg/which_choreography_best_showcases_or_represents/,buffystan,1503388358,"Inspired by u/youlostTheGamelol 's post posing the question, ""Which song best represents each member in a group?""




Do you think this can apply to dance/ the choreographies? I think so. So, which choreography best showcases or represents each member of groups you follow?





Example:



**Red Velvet**


* Joy - [Russian Roulette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt03rDZYPUY). Joy isn't the strongest dancer in the group, of course she's got Seulgi and Irene as competition, which ain't easy. But I certainly noticed this comeback that she had a fuller understanding of her body than, say, the ICC or DD eras. That dance has a lot of strange idiosyncrasies and awkward movements that are hard to pull off. But she commits herself to the full movement, [looking strong and entirely in control of this spastic, almost distracted looking choreo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtnqMYvUjWw). Plus, smiling like sunshine (that smirk at the beginning) making the whole performance 1000x better. 





* Seugli - [Rookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWWMKS-asTw) This was a hard one since Seulgi really personally attacks each choreo she's thrown. I wanted to give it to Dumb Dumb, until I remembered [this moment](https://youtu.be/J0h8-OTC38I?t=1m2s) from the MV and feeling like Seugi's dancing is the Truth, and I needed to spread the good word. The way she can find such precision in such small moments, while still inflicting her colorful, sensually bouncy and hard hitting flair - all of this is showcased in the chorus of Rookie. [Her charms always shine through, but Rookie suits just how dynamic Seulgi's subtle but vibrant style is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5uPulrXE7Y)






* Yeri - [One Of These Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RYKLQjfvU0) - Perhaps one wouldn't associate this with a dance, but there's a [low key dance break](https://youtu.be/7GzvIzVQROc?t=2m27s) with her and Seulgi which she absolutely nails. i think Yeri had such an etherial styling that comeback and it completely suited the poignant nuances of the gestural movements. I also really like how Yeri uses her gestures and even her facial features to perform (although that last one isn't entirely showcased here). I'm simply in love with Yeri + Velvet concepts.



* Wendy - [BE NATURAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKgR20BYN0M). I honestly don't even think I need to explain. This classy sensuality in this choreo, and the way her hair falls around her when she executes it, [I am taken aback by her elegance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP2r3we-gjE). I don't think that more Velvet quality is showcased enough/well in Red Velvet's usually rapid and sometimes spastic dances. 



* Irene - [Red Flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuMN_xUR5Uw). When I think of Irene's style, I think precision. (Xiyeon from Pristin reminds me of her in this way). Everything is in place. She is so petite and placed. This choreo's almost robotic elements suit her, while the [extremely high energy of the beginning of the chorus](https://youtu.be/kxKWNw0tUhU?t=47s) gives such a rush, only proving that her energy is quite infectious. A refined and energetic dance for a refined and energetic dancer.







**BTS** (this one is hard)


* Jimin - [Spring Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AlODdAInRY)




* J-Hope - [No More Dream (Dance break ver.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtLfK6W1rwI)



* Suga - [Dope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrNfJ7AwW_g)



* Jungkook - [Baepsae](https://youtu.be/V1i_x2_TGE0?t=42s) / [Not Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkTlZZirRcY)




* V - [20th Century Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvYr3lmM7Fk)



* Jin - [Save Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjt_sA2eso)



* RapMon - [Not Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3NHiiIhEoc)

When I get into groups and learn about them, I like to sometimes see the ones that are considered not as good as other members to see how they grow as acts.

Two examples off the top of my head  
-BTS' Suga.  You know for a guy who seems to be more about the lyrics and the verse, that guy can really cut a rug.  I just happened to see him in the dance version of Not Today and that guy was frequently catching my eye.  Looking at the other videos, I'd say he really does quite well as a dancer.  
-Twice's Jihyo.  I mean we already know she was a trainee like forever but sometimes I just never really notice Jihyo that much when she dances.  But then Signal happened and somehow she managed to really show her appeal not just in visual or singing but dancing too.  I really honestly thought she was doing as well as Momo.

* Im starting a series of official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! You can list as much as you please whether its hits or personal favorites! 

* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Oldies**!

* Everything before 2010 counts. (Ill allow songs from 2010 too.)

* Include the year the song came out if you want!

Here are my contributions -

* [Big Bang - A Fools Only Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVetyA1KfG0) 2006

* [SHINee - Ring Ding Dong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roughtzsCDI) 2009 (Yes I know there is a bit of an intro to it, but its not too bad.)

* [Super Junior - Sorry Sorry](https://youtu.be/AAWqnA8PdcY) 2009 

* [Taeyang - Wedding Dress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSqGieM5GYM) 2010

* [GD &amp; TOP - Dont Go Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLbkqk1u2RI) (or Don't Leave) 2010


[Oldies playlist here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgdssDGfVGewvKBCdx4KEEzEt)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.

* The playlists will be alphabetized by group and soloists. 

* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)

* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

The rest was learning about Asia .

I love how Asian culture is reaching the western music culture and I been noticing the impact of it as well.

Even western artist are coming out more 
And their styles is of Asian culture 
Like Poppy ..
To me it's like Asian culture is replacing black culture .

Also, warning, this is really long. Ive labeled the Concert and Hi-Touch sections :)

Okay, so as soon as they announced their tour, I was super psyched to go see them. Chicago isnt really close to me (12 hr drive), but its the closest they were coming and Seventeen is my absolute favorite group, so I knew I had to go see them if they came to the states. I had missed out on Kcon NY last year when they came, so this was kind of my second chance at seeing them, in a  way. I managed to get VIP tickets during presale (bless), which meant I got a Hi-Touch pass, too, so I was even *more* excited than I wouldve been anyway. The days leading up I was literally shaking with excitement lol

Anyway, people had actually started lining up outside the doors at like 9 that morning. Concert pre-gaming with songs and dancing was going on all day, and it was really fun to watch :)  Those who received Hi-Touch passes could go by and get them starting at 1pm that day (concert opened doors at 6pm). I went to get mine about 3 pm or so, and as I walked in, I could hear MY I being practiced, and at that moment it all kinda felt like a dream. Like, I couldnt believe it was really happening :)   After I got my pass I walked out and saw some girls outside that had coordinated a Pink and Blue ocean for Seventeen, using little baggies that we would put over our light sticks, which were designated to which section you were located in. They asked me which section I was in and gave me a pink baggy to match. 

After this, I went back to my hotel for a while and to get freshened up for the concert. I didnt wanna get to the venue really early, so I arrived right at 6. Bad idea. The line for admission was quite literally wrapped around the building. Thank goodness the crossing guards from Rosemont were doing a good job with traffic, because it was *really* congested and something couldve easily happened, what with how excited everyone was.

So, while I was in line another girl came over and had photo cards she was giving out. I received The8 and honestly the card was so cute I couldve cried. There was also a girl that gave out these really pretty banners to hold up during Mansae :) 

The line, surprisingly, moved incredibly quickly, despite how many people were there.  As soon as you walked through the doors, you could hear Mansae being played on the screens in the theater, as well as the super loud screams :) It was honestly so amazing to hear so many Carats screaming in unison when the boys werent even out yet :) 

**CONCERT TIME** 


After some time of sitting and socializing with other Carats, and a bit of a delay, the lights finally started to dim, and their opening VCR came on, so we knew it Was Time. Everyone stood up to welcome the boys to the stage. The screams were incredibly loud, so Im sure they felt the love :) 

They opened with Pretty U. They were all super super *super* hyped up, and you could tell they were so excited and happy to be there! It was lovely! They then did Beautiful, which I was so excited to hear, because its so nice live! They then went on to Adore U and then did their opening comments. 

Side note, the setlist was the same for Hong Kong, if you weren't wanting to read my exact reaction for every song lol

The order was Seungkwan, Dino, Vernon, Wonwoo, The8, Mingyu, Jeonghan, Woozi, S.coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, and Jun. They all introduced themselves in english! Theyve worked so hard to communicate with their english speaking fans and it was so touching to hear them speak in english :) 

Afterwards, they performed Very Nice (wow, that was SO, SO, SOOO GOOD live! Words cant express the energy!) and Swimming Fool ( my FAVORITE song ever tbh). After, they played a VCR of their middle school photos while stagehands moved around some props (desks) for the next song. After the VCR, Seventeen came back out in school-ish looking uniforms and performed Mansae. Near the end, right before the last chorus, they extended the beat and we clapped while chanting Mansae! :-D 

Next was Boom Boom. Lord, that song was meant to be played at a concert. Everything about it was amazing! Their choreography and synchronization was on point, as always. Afterwards, Vernon and Dino came out for a few minutes and talked about Going Seventeen! They had their cameras with them and Vernon was like You know what these cameras are for? and everybody screamed Yes! and Dino was so energetic and excited throughout the whole thing! 

Then Vocal Units VCR came on (I think) When Vocal Unit came out, they sang We Gonna Make it Shine. My ears were not prepared for how beautiful they would sound omg. Seungkwans voice is absolutely to die for.  Later, they performed Dont Listen In Secret. Again, their vocals really are no joke. All of them were amazing.  Seokmin nearly made me cry with how lovely he sounded. 

After, Hip Hop Unit came on and performed Un Haeng Il Chi. To be completely honest, when this was released on Soundcloud I didn't really like it a lot, simply since it wasnt my taste. BOY OH BOY did hearing it live change that though. The whole song goes **hard**, and Carats went absolutely crazy during it! It was such an amazing vibe! After that, they performed Check In, to which every single member of the audience sang along with. During Mingyus Woah Yeah!, everyone screamed it SO LOUD!! It was an absolute blast! 

After this, Performance Units VCR came on (again, bless). They performed OMG (which was AMAZING live!!) and Highlight (Remix). Even though you can tell just how hard the choreography is in the video, its still absolutely stunning just how intense and intricate it is when you see it in person! Truly could not have taken my eyes off of them, even if I had wanted to! 

Next, all the guys came back out and did Crazy in Love. SUCH an intricate performance! Their expression was amazing! After, all went back aside from Jun and The8 and they performed MY I. It is so beautiful to see on stage, oh my goodness. Then Vocal Unit came back out and did Habit, and once again, I was in awe of their talent. Then Hip Hop unit came out and did If I and it was really great:) From where I was sitting, I could see Wonwoo and Mingyu really well, and when the last chorus came on and they did they hip motion WOO THE SCREAMING!! 

After this, all of them came back out and they joked around a little. They got Mingyu to do the Sexy dance from If I again and afterwards he just went IM SO! SHY! lmao They also (after some encouraging), got Seungkwan to do it! Everyone screamed so loud!!

Next, they did Rock (amazing to see live. Holy body rolls, Jun does **not** disappoint), Chuck (goes hard AF), and then we had a VCR of them telling what Carats mean to  them :) 

In the final stretch, they did Shining Diamond (without Hoshi in the middle :(( ), then Healing! I WAS SO GLAD THEY DID THIS I LOVE IT SO MUCH. THEY SHOT CONFETTI AND STREAMERS OUT DURING IT IT WAS SO GREAT. We had our light covers on for the Ocean Project at the time, and everything was so beautiful!! 

Then came the closing :( They said they really liked what we had done with the lightsticks, that they were really beautiful! I waved at Vernon and he saw me and waved back! Woozi called Carats beautiful (I almost cried) during his closing statement, too! The8 spoke entirely in English and basically said that he knew his English wasnt great, but that he was working really hard for us! Seungkwan said the ocean was beautiful! Everybody seemed to have had such a good time! It was wonderful!

**HI-TOUCH TIME**

After they left, an announcement came on for those with Hi-Touch to stay there. I waited probably 20 minutes for it to get started and get in. We weren't allowed to film at all during. Before walking through the doors to the Hi-Touch section, they told us to have our left hand up. 

When I walked into the area they were in, I was overwhelmed with the feeling. Like, It was such an overwhelming feeling of *goodness*. I cant really describe to make sense, but basically the whole thing just felt really pleasant, like they were just happy that we were happy. But moving on.

Dino was first and HOLY CRAP I wasnt ready. Like, he was so cute in person?? And he smiled like he was just so happy to see each and every one of us! Also, I know everyone says it about idols who theyve gotten Hi-Touch with, but it was *ridiculous* how soft his hands were. Like, nothing compares. Literal clouds or something. But anyway, I saw him and told him I loved him (side note, did this for all of them lol). Next was Joshua. I told him he was really funny and he said thank you to me!! His voice was so soft omg. Next was (I think) Mingyu. Side note, Im *really* petite. Like, 4 10 petite. SO when Mingyu saw me, he literally leaned down closer to me, which was so, so sweet. And he was grinning so big (his canines really are incredible) omg it was the happiest smile I died a little. Then I think it was Vernon who was next. He smiled nicely and honestly I was kinda shocked at how tall he actually is? Like I still think of him as being younger and smaller, but the dudes grown *so* much in the past couple years omg. Then was (I think), S.Coups. Again, he saw me and leaned down closer to me. Literally didnt take his eyes off me the entire time and smiled (his dimples!) like he was so glad to see me!! I told him he was a good leader and he smiled some more :) Then it was Seungkwan. I told him he was really beautiful and he smiled at me :)) 

Next it was Woozi. I was so nervous about him omg. Like, I saw him and just kinda froze. I asked him to marry me. He just kinda looked at me honestly best moment of my life and he is SO ATTRACTIVE OMG. Hes also a lot smaller built in person than I thought he would be. Honestly, it really made me feel good :) Next was DK. I was honestly still in shock, so I kinda forgot to say anything to him and just smiled super big. Hes so handsome in person! Then Jun was next! I had so much I wanted to say to him, but I was super nervous and so I wound up just telling him that I loved him so much :) His shoulder are ***super*** broad in person, like its unreal. And he was smiling so beautifully I love him so much. Then Wonwoo was next. Im not even entirely sure if I said anything to him tbh. Next was Jeonghan. I was honestly super intimidated by him, just because hes got such a graceful presence that it freaked me out a little. And finally, The8. I was so glad to see him and I told him his english was really good. He smiled at me :)) 

Then I walked out in a daze and saw that there were some more concert goers doing Kpop games/dancing outside. It was such a nice way to end the night:)

The entire event felt like a dream come true. They were all so sweet and appreciative and seemed to love us all so much. I also walked away with 3 new biases (not that I didnt already bias the lot of them). Im really sad that Hoshi couldn't be there, but Im super glad he got to rest:) He needed it. I hope this account is interesting/useful for some other prospective concert goers :) Sorry its so long! I kinda got carried away with the details!

Friday

12AM still no ohmygirl airport pictures, went to bed nervous. was supposed to sleep 4h30m until 5AM, yet I ended up only getting like 1h30m of sleep and the rest rolling around in bed and checking for new information.

5AM I get up and shower since I was too excited to sleep anymore, get on discord and start hyping people up about wjsn and girl's day showing up at the airport. Started creating a periscope account. Ate small breakfast.

Around 6:30AM I check if Sil's online/awake. Blasted dreamcatcher on the way to his house.
LA/freeway traffic was not bad, made it to LAX pretty neatly. We saw some airplanes fly over us on the way there, getting worried that wjsn might be in one of them and arrive early.

9AM We're out of the car and walking towards a terminal (didn't know exactly which). Located yubseyo and his crew and met them for the first time. They talk about how there was two exits and that we were unsure which they were going to come out of. Last year IOI came out of the smaller exit, yet there was absolutely noone around that one.

We walk around to look for food (someone said shake shack was in the airport, but we found out it's behind the departure gate lmao), ultimately get drinks and some quick finger food. We return to our spot and still not that many people are there. KweenHyojung walked from his hotel and found us and met us for the first time.

10AM? I turn on my periscope out of boredom and start streaming everything around us. Around 30-50 people joined in to see what was going on thanks to people spreading the link on discord. It cut out a couple times because I was on data and battery running out/phone overheating. 1 hr periscope cost me like 10 bucks of data... ;;

11AM 1 hour later we're getting nervous and confused and eventually flock towards the smaller exit. Eventually everyone comes to our side and a large crowd starts forming at the outside door. Girls with stools. Boy groups start coming out and none of us can tell who it was LOL. WJSN come out and they were super dressed, just like at incheon airport! Everyone was filming with mostly their phone cameras, my periscope caught them but it was terrible and it cut out.. so yea. Loved seeing Exy and Luda was so small lmao. Girl's Day came out shortly after but they all masks/glasses on basically, so it was really hard to recognize them besides sojin noona.

11:30AM Back to our car, now +1 with KweenHyojung so he doesn't have to uber. Rushing through LA traffic with a timer on our hitouch was a little stressful (had an offer to buy), but we made it early enough on time. Found the planned free parking and needed to find our hitouch seller before she got into the line for Heize hitouch, so we walked real fast. Traded $50 for the hitouch right outside the bag check. Then we walked up some stairs to right in front of the benefits claim, where around 20-30 people were trading tickets. Immediately we find another OMG hitouch seller lmao, got it for $50 again which they were surprised at. Sadly KweenHyojung couldn't go sunday for the hitouch so he didn't need to get one.

12PM We check if we need benefits, and we meet Daniel w/ the Wuju shirt we met at the airport. I had to set up my wifi hotspot for his laptop (named jiho with pass iuiu123 LOL). We didn't get benefits so we just got our 1-day bracelet that lets us into the con (later to be upgraded). 

12:30PM We planned to go home around this time, we weren't planning to go to wjsn hitouch or anything, but seeing as we both had our omg hitouches and extra money still, I decided to look for a wjsn hitouch. KweenHyojung gets a fb message for a $30 wjsn hitouch, cheapest offer seen in 2 days. We quickly decide to go inside and upgrade our con tickets later. I get the hitouch and we go around discovering the really loud convention. Sil still needs to find a hitouch (he has a free audience pass already).

2PM We try to find more info about the ohmygirl merch raffle, find a huge line because of wannaone fans. find out that only 50 people are winning the raffles, and people can whale and just buy chances until they received their ticket. super concerning. We stay in the line to see if we can enter the raffle early for tomorrow's omg fanmeet. Guard says they're all sold out and we panic. They say there might be more chances tomorrow but they're not confirmed. suuuuper bummed. we walk around depressingly. didn't even eat lul

4:30PM WJSN hitouch coming up, had to ditch Sil and Tuan to get into hitouch line. They went outside to look for more hitouches, but eventually found nothing. I get into the hitouch with KweenHyojung (he traded SF9 for it). Our spots weren't very good, like 3rd row. Super tired at this point, with no food and 1h of sleep lmao. Sitting in the line was nice, but they made us start standing like 30 minutes early. That was a hella long 30 minutes, especially with no wjsn music (they played a bunch of boy group mvs, terrible dj compared to last year). Legs dying stomach saddening. Finally wjsn start to come out, they played half of Happy and the crowd got real hype with lots of singing and chants. They come out and I just enjoy watching instead of wasting energy to record (everyone else is already). I often had to switch between watching the screen and watching them since people's heads can get in the way. Honestly can't remember much more interesting to say here, also most of the hitouch is on camera for you to watch. link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMTHbLz1r7Q s/o to yubseyo

5:30PM or something, we can finally sit down. The airbnb group is all together now (like 10 people), talking about how the hitouch went down. We had to decide if me and Sil were going home or going out to eat with them. We decide to go with them, but first go to get free Pristin posters if Sil labels them oldest to youngest in order. We got it from a girl in TeamIdealSubs so that was cool (too bad my poster got bodied later in the car). When we get back to the group KweenHyojung ditched us gg

6PM can't even remember the place we ate gg but it was not-ayce kbbq and it was really quality meat, with waiters that cooked for you. the parking for that place was the most nightmare parking lot you can think of, with 90 degree turns and extremely steep ramps LOL. our table was pretty quiet with Lewis/Sister from T3UF, but it was still enjoyable and really good. also got boba later for the drive home (around 10PM). finally got confirmations on omg's flight time (around 11AM) because of the airport pictures so we try to get home asap.

12AM needed a lot of sleep for tomorrow but only got like 4h30m or so, rip.

=======
Saturday


9AM Woke up late and sped to Sil's house to get there at like 9:30. Also we have Sil's friend join since she wanted to see airport interactions.

11AM OhMyGirl Airport - got there 10 minutes early, just in time (much lighter traffic on saturday). People from the airbnb are there again, in front of the same entrance. There was definitely a lot less people this time, since it was only Astro/Bona/OMG in the morning. We watched the korean guards in black constantly try to usher cars out of the parking zone so they could get their vans in lol. They had to get 3 different vans/drivers in, which was what made the whole ordeal take so long! Unluckily OMG came last, but fortunately we still had most of the crowd. It was nice having enough miracles to have a warm welcome for ohmygirl. There were girls with OhMyGirl shirts, people with banners (reach with his ghetto Camera/Banner setup LOL). Lots of people had gifts (we think more than the other girl groups), so I hope they enjoyed their gifts! The guys standing next to me had bears + roses, although I don't think Jiho was able to pick it all up, probably got thrown away :[ I didn't have the clearest view of them since I went for a risky fancam angle near the van, but looking back at the vods, they were pretty happy and surprised to see so many of us there. Next time I need to stand in front of the van so the guards can't block my view and I can get more guaranteed waves to the camera. The whole situation was really intimidating tbh.

1PM We rush to the convention to get Sil's friend her con tix. We rush to the merch booths only to find out that both were sold out already, and we were super bummed. Later we found out that some people were able to buy merch and get into the raffle, then make it to the airport in time to see omg, so that made us salty.

2PM-4PM We went to the street food vendors but eventually ended up getting hotdogs since we ran out of time (sil didn't eat anything!). We go back to participate in another raffle that only had like 1 winner. We were able to get in line twice lol, but eventually one of our friends wins the raffle. I was hoping someone would win and resell it to us. Now we're just waiting in front of Star Square talking to the staff to get more information about how the event will go and where it's best to sit/wait. Sil gets to buy a ticket from Alox for $60, and I end up ultimately empty handed :[

4:30PM OhMyGirl Fansign -- Had front row spots right where the staff told us they would be signing the plastic screen. We were really close to them! Arin waved at us and our friend Zach got a good camera of that. Other than that... the media staff and the people in the fanmeet line really blocked everyone's views, so only people that could really see are the people taking cams inside the line. So there's not much to talk about unless you were a part of the event, alternatively you can watch one of their cams! OMG Hitouch is tomorrow! Oh we did catch them on the exit, and got a few handheld cams of that, but it was really short so I don't think many people uploaded that.

7:30PM Day 1 Concert -- Sat away from Sil so didn't really get to talk to him. Our seats were super far but it was still enjoyable, especially WJSN's BTS cover. Not much to talk about here. Oh yeah the pre-show beatbox performance was lit.

10PM We meet up with the airbnb boys outside the venue and we're all talking about different moments. We have our sleeping materials this time so we leave early to find parking for our car near the airbnb while the other group walks/gets dinner. We found a building with $33 parking overnight lmao so ridiculous. We eventually settle for $10 outside parking.

11PM We're just sitting inside the airbnb watching everyone's fancams on a large monitor, which was pretty fun to relive the moments. The cams for the fansign were so clear! Made me feel a bit better about not getting in. So much fanservice! Then we talk about random stuff while waiting for our other group to come back with 100 wings for 10 people. probably the comfiest kcon dinner I've had yet, with some really funny conversation and beer. Alternatively we could have gone to bcd or innout to hunt for girl groups, since apparently some of them did show up at those that night...! Then finish watching yubseyo's concert cams while slowly easing ourselves into sleep. Me and Sil ended up not even using our sleeping bags lmao. Gotta get up early for OMG hitouch.

=======
Sunday

9AM With only 3 hours of sleep, I shower quickly (why was there so much a/c, holy moly it was cold) and we leave a little late, and then proceed to forget my keys on the floor of the airbnb. luckily firestar was about to start walking to the con anyways, so he could easily hand us the keys. We park at the same parking and arrive to the con like 5 minutes before doors open. What we should have expected was that people were already lined up outside the con. We were surprised to see a HUGE got7 audience waiting line and already lines forming for OMG hitouch/audience. With better planning, we could have been the front of the OMG hitouch line, but it ended up not mattering that much (still 2nd row and we were on the louder side!)

10AM OhMyGirl Hitouch -- This is where I took a picture of the hitouch line for the discord. People were playing ohmygirl's title songs in the hitouch line which is always nice. We start standing up to get into the hitouch room, and none of the miracles rushed/ran frantically like people usually do so that was nice to see! It was nice and orderly! We got 2nd row on the left side which happened to be the livelier side with more hype and noise. We talked a bit to the people around us, and again they didn't play relevant music to the artist that was coming, which was upsetting. Finally ohmygirl come out, and everyone's screaming. They wave to everyone and pay extra attention to our side which was doing all sorts of sounds and motions. There was a lot of name yelling and it was hard for the mc to get us to settle down. The rest should be in the fancams!

When it came time for hitouch, I went early since Binnie was getting rushed by the MC so I was really afraid of getting cut off by the event running out of time. I went over the rehearsed things in my head: deep blue eyes for yooa, aing for hyojung, mira keuri keuri for jiho, but it was so hard to focus with all the screaming and omg fanservice. By the time it was my turn I was super nervous, and I had to greet Mimi first. For the most part I said ""I love you"" to each of them, but also the little things I prepared for them. Sadly I choked at Jiho's beauty when I got to her and completely forgot to do my greeting. it's devastating since she was waiting for it right after I did something for Hyojung :[ After I get back into the crowd, I looked for Sil to cry about it but couldn't find him, so I just stood back in the front (even better view this time!). When they were saying their final words, I was able to catch Jiho's attention and do the mira keuri keuri (her reaction here: https://youtu.be/RxZZchw7B-I?t=21), so I didn't fail after all!

12PM Everyone's dead. we're all sitting outside talking about how it went. There's not much else to do at this time so there was a lot of sitting around and reminiscing the events. We got free sample stuff and food (4$ takoyaki omo) but that's about it.

5PM We need tickets for Day 2 still lmao. We look outside for scalpers but there are barely any. We've been eyeing a P3 ticket for 109 each for a couple hours now on stubhub, and finally decide to purchase it and have it ready on our phones. We spot Alox walking around and call him over. There was also another girl with the same exclusive OhMyGirl cupid shirt as Alox, was tempting to go try and talk to her. Eventually us 3 get into the staples center nice and early, so we find some seats in the bar and talk about what we think will happen. Around this time everyone on discord was tuned into the live stream, so we were actually checking our phones and talking to everyone theorizing when and what omg were gonna perform lol.

7PM The preshow was starting to begin, so we got to our seats. Alox took some seats in front of us since noone was there yet, but he later had to relocate to his actual seats. I remember the concert announcing upcoming artists and Tae Woo and OhMyGirl weren't a part of that list... was a bit concerning lol. 

While the concert was going we were talking about what we would do when OMG came up, we also looked up some fanchants to refresh our memory (we looked up windy day though.. such a hard one). When they came out, we stood up and screamed, shaking our very accurate duplicates of the light-green lightsticks they sold at their first concert. They ended up performing Coloring Book, much to everyone's expectation, however they were facing away from our seats, which is also what we expected. We cheered them on and tried to wave whenever they turned around during the choreo. I was singing my heart out!

When they ended, they started doing their introduction. They waved to everyone in a 360, and Binnie especially took notice of us. Either she remembered us or noticed our lightsticks and us standing! At the end of their introduction, JIHO STARTED TO HINT AT CLOSER!! Everyone was freaking out, okay not everyone but there were some screams and we were definitely shocked. Discord was also freaking out unsurprisingly. Closer was made by a producer in LA, so it was really fitting that they get to perform it to the LA crowd. A lot of the girls love Closer, so they must be satisfied to have this as their second song. Most of us were expecting Aing/Windy Day, or even Liar Liar. And just like planned, they turned around to face us performing Closer. We couldn't believe it, I was squealing. Even with them closest to us on the stage, it still felt kind of far, but still so surreal. I didn't do any fanchants but I sung my heart out and tried to wave frantically during moments they were facing/looking up towards us. There weren't that many moments, and they seemed really focused with not as much fanservice as Coloring Book, which I admired a lot. It would've been so great to be standing up closer for this performance TT

10PM After the endless boy groups we decide to go to BCD's for the chance that a group will show up there again. Sadly no one went, I think the only venturing OMG did was Yooa venturing around the shopping center near their hotel. We still enjoyed a great meal there, people drank a lot of soju and we took a nice group picture.

12AM Driving home, after dropping off Sil I blasted Windy Day ontheway home and cried and sang extremely loud to get the post concert depression/withdrawals out. I wanted to feel like I was still at the concert. Think I did this for Apink's solo concert too. It's like not wanting to leave that loud atmosphere. I felt so dead when I got home lol.

I'll get to the point. I think it's so important that as international fans we should always be thankful for the content that is shared with us. ESPECIALLY the people who translate for us, write subtitles and reupload content for us. In my own personal opinion, if we are interested in Korean culture, we should make the effort to learn more about it. 

Now of course, if we can't access or don't understand the content, how are we to help promote and support the success of the kpop industry? 

I am not saying that you shouldn't ask for subs or things like that but it's important to be patient about these things. Ask very politely if they are able to subtitle, otherwise wait for another source to upload and always say thank you. Korean uploaders are not obliged to provide subtitles for us. 

I'm not here to shame anyone, I just hate seeing Korean and international fans argue when we could be supporting kpop together. 

Update: Thanks so much for taking the time to read, even though my message is a given and many of you are kind and patient fans. Had no idea how tame this community was :')


*misunderstandings between ifans and kfans concerning wanna one. The aftermath was only an inspiration for this post. Not directly related. I saw many Korean fans upset on media about ifans misinterpreting the Korean language which caused them to discuss holding off purposely from subbing content for ifans.

Ive bolded the different sections so you can skip to what youre interested in if you want. Please let me know if you have any questions!** 

Hello! This is my first fan account so bear with me here, but I figure since I'm yapping about SHINee all the time, I'd talk about my experiences in Korea these past few days.

So I actually planned this trip as a short stopover on my way to China where I will be studying this semester. My good friend /u/L-autrichienne (hereby called L) offered to let me stay with her and show me the sites which I couldn't refuse! Since I'm only here 5 days total, I wasn't getting my hopes up for anything SHINee-related happening. But! I got really lucky because they announced that Key would do a second run of his play, Save the Green Planet, while I was visiting. Then, later, Taemin's first Korean concert and a comeback were announced. As you can see, the comeback has been postponed. But the concerts were still on!

**Save the Green Planet:**

The awesome L managed to get us tickets to the play, which was so exciting because tickets were quite limited (small show). However, I was really worried because I hadn't managed to get a ticket to the concert (which also had limited seating and extremely high demand). More on that later.
For the record, Key's show was a play, not a musical, and it was entirely in Korean which I don't speak. However, I watched the movie it was based off of beforehand (recommend!) so I would have an idea of what was happening. There was quite a bit of speaking (at impressively high speeds), but I was still able to grasp what was going on pretty well from the actions and my knowledge of the plot. The plot is extremely interesting and pretty strange, but I won't give a synopsis here.

The great thing about it being such a small production was how intimate it was. We were near that back, but that was still only the 6th row! When Key came out he looked directly at the crowd and ran out and pretended to shoot some of the audience - it was fairly interactive in this way. The cast was small, only 4 people, but I felt they were all quite impressive.

Also important to note that the audience was pretty much entirely Shawols. There are several actors that play the main character, including Key, so on the nights where he performs obviously fans come out in droves. Because of this the cast had the freedom to throw in a lot of nods towards the fans. At the beginning the man on his phone was talking about how ""SHINee Five is fucking awesome"", the sort of gag-man actor (played every supporting role) had a riot with it, using some Ring Ding Dong choreo for example (which made Key chuckle). I'm sure there was some more of that stuff that I didn't catch due to the language barrier.

When the cast came out at the end, everyone swiftly grabbed their things and prepared to leave as soon as they exited. L warned me beforehand that it was going to be a mad dash to go out and line up to see Key as he left the venue, but I wasn't quite prepared for how intense it would be. Like I said, we were near the back so we were kind of leading the charge, but the pushing to get out was pretty crazy. We made it to the exit and formed lines on both sides, I was right by the door. Then there was a sort of creepy silence while we waited a few minutes for him to leave. As he came out he was gently saying hello and such, everybody kept a respectful distance. I got a video but it was mostly his back as he walked away. He was so sweet!

**Concert ticketing:** 

We made plans to rush to Taemins concert venue immediately after Keys play to line up overnight for Friday ticketing. We packed some things like a change of clothes to give to Ls friend to meet us with, because we had dressed up for the play. So as soon as Key was out of sight, we ran to the train station.

Here's the twist: when we got to the platform to wait for our train, L started filming me asking for my thoughts on the play. I was caught off guard so I was laughing awkwardly, when suddenly she pulls out a ticket to Taemins concert and reveals that we won't be lining up overnight after all! The whole thing was a surprise that everyone was in on :) She managed to snag me a floor ticket (and a seat for herself)! I was honestly shocked, as I had been expecting to go through all the hassle and probably come up empty handed. Everybody was in on it too, including her friend who we were supposed to meet and /u/monodramas who we have a group chat with. I cannot thank her enough for that (and for giving me a place to stay and being my personal guide to Seoul and just generally being amazing!!!)

**Taemin Concert:**

Alright, here's the part you're probably most interested in. Taemins first Korean solo concert! This was the Friday show so the very first one.

So we got to the venue early to pick up lightsticks before they sold out. It was a bit confusing figuring out which line I needed to go in for my floor ticket, but eventually I made my way into the venue. I knew going in that I'm not assertive enough to push my way through people to the front, but I was satisfied with where I got to stand, a few rows back from the front of the extended stage. I was taller than most of the people around me (though they got very creative with their high platform shoes!) at 510 so my view wasn't an issue. Standing around waiting for the show to start was interesting, they played some promotional videos on the screen and it was hilarious how the crowd would go crazy whenever a glimpse of SHINee was shown (complete silence otherwise). At one point Taemin accidentally breathed into his mic backstage and everybody gasped, which he later mentioned he thought was adorable. I watched the audience for a bit and noticed them usher in some guys who seemed to be celebrities, but I didn't know who they were.

Finally, the first VCR started playing. I was sort of freaking out so I don't remember it entirely, but there was a lot of creepy imagery like his face being covered in blood and such. Creepy turned out to be a sort of theme of the concert. Then he appeared and started performing Rise. He had some kind of lace veil over his head and it was very dramatic, I think I figured it was just a concert intro until he mentioned it was a new song. Then he performed Drip Drop, which was the point where he came out to the extended stage (near me) to do end bit - you know, where he starts humping the floor and all. Everybody was losing their minds at this point. My heart kind of stopped seeing how close he was. The energy didn't let up after that, he went on to perform Guess Who and Sexuality before breaking to greet the audience. Sexuality was.. about what you would expect from a song called Sexuality. He didn't hold back one bit with all the thrusting (as is his tendency), and the venue was getting noticeably warmer.

When he spoke I couldn't understand what he was saying but it was great to just see his smiling face, it's such a contrast to his performance demeanor. He seemed a bit nervous (this was the first show) and was speaking in his typical rushed Taemin manner. But boy does he love to play around with the fans, he gets such satisfaction out of making everyone scream his name. He then announced that he was going to perform his new song, Thirsty. Oh boy.
Now, I'll just say that besides killing everybody with the performance (the audience reflected the song title), Thirsty is a fucking bop. It was definitely my favorite of the new songs he revealed and I can't wait for it to be released.

Then Taemin went backstage and they proceeded to play the creepiest fucking VCR I have ever seen. I shouldn't have been one bit surprised considering this is Taemin and he loves this shit. It was very Paranormal Activity, complete with Taemin contorting in bed like something from The Exorcism and jump scares. It was thrilling to watch with a bunch of girls (and one guy) already emotionally fragile from Taemins first set.

After that Taemin came back out and performed Experience, which included some choreo with a giant handkerchief that I just knew he was going to fuck up a bit (he's the best dancer I've ever seen but nothing can overcome those magic hands). I won't go through every single song he performed, but at this point he started performing Korean versions of some of his Japanese discography, including Flame of Love (gorgeous, ethereal, life changing), Do It Baby (so fucking fun for concerts), and later Im Crying (boo hoo), TIGER (ft. headbanging), DOOR, and Sayonara Hitori.

He didn't do the entire Press It album, which was a shame because Until Today and Mystery Lover are some of my favorite songs ever - though I understood because they didn't really match the energy of the concert. There was a live band which was awesome for songs like One by One. We also got to hear him do a piano solo before performing Soldier which was really touching.
I was caught off guard when he started singing Romeo+Juliette, a SHINee song (and a bop go listen to it now), but someone reminded me later that he performed it as his first solo stage at SHINees first concert so that made sense. He's particularly fond of that song, though it was a bit emotional hearing him sing something OT5.

For one VCR he performed a breathtaking choreography in an empty room. The song didn't have any words but I wonder if it was a preview for a new song (I hope so because I'm dying to see him perform that again). The other VCR was ABC of Taemin (only went up to G), which just showed a lot of cute shots of him behind the scenes and such - though it was hilarious when it said B was for bad boy yet couldn't find any video evidence to support it.

He sang Wicked while going around on the second floor on his cart, and he happened to be wearing a very see-through red shirt so the screams were like a wave around the venue as he went by each section. I had a perfect view of L having a religious experience as his cart went directly in front of her. This was interesting from the standing section because we were all turning in circles to watch him go around! When he got back he started performing Pretty Boy, which we helped with because Kai wasn't there.

The final song he performed before the encore was Danger, and when he went backstage we were supposed to all sing Danger together. Which was super fucking hard. We kept messing up starting off hahah. Finally everybody got in sync and we managed to pull it off, but the song isnt really meant to be sung without layered vocals like that (because you have to switch back and forth between the deep chanting and the high DANGERRRRRR super quick). Taemin later commented that he was surprised we sang it!

When he returned for the encore he performed the Korean version of Door, which is super elaborate and gorgeous. He also did Goodbye, which was actually the one solo stage I had seen him perform in person before (SWCV in LA), but it fit really well with Door. Then he announced he would perform his new song Love, but I couldnt understand him so I momentarily thought he was going to sing SHINees Japanese song Love, which would have been weird. It was a really pretty song, it kind of reminded me of something Jonghyun would sing! Finally, he finished off with Hypnosis. If I hadnt been convinced of Taemins vocal skill prior to this concert, theres no way I could have left without 100% confidence in it. He pushes himself so hard physically that its hard to balance with vocals, but when he focused on them they truly shined.

Watching Taemin perform can be a somewhat unsettling experience. Hes one of those people that puts his entire self into a performance, which puts you on edge because you want to make sure hes okay and not pushing himself too hard. At his Japanese solo concert in July, they showed him backstage in between songs looking like he was going to pass out, shaking and saying how he was going to throw up and he couldnt do it (then he of course got right back up on stage and performed like nothing happened). Luckily, I think he showed a bit more restraint here and the concert was spaced in a way that allowed him to maintain his energy. Still, those moments where you see him just going for it are pretty magical. I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to experience the concert first-hand!

Once again, if you have any questions feel free to ask! I probably forgot a lot of stuff despite this being super long. Today is my last day here in Korea so I'm doing some sightseeing, but I'll try to respond quickly!",4,93,False,self,,,,,

It reminded me of [SHINee - Sherlock](https://youtu.be/N8VRaGe3Cqs) (probably a lot of people's favorites, mine included lol). It felt weird on Weekly Idol when Onew was injured and on his solo part they got pulled by.. magic? Also all the moves where they create shadows would be weird without someone 

Also, the craziness of every member doing something reminded me of Seventeen's choreos, esp. [Adore U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPYLRdLZ5ts) or [Pretty U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpHfh9VUOek)

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

It's on Immortal Songs 2 where I got the opportunity to see how amazing Ailee's voice is. 

Sonnet Son. Her voice is mind-blowing. I've shown videos of her performing Bohemian Rhapsody to friends and their mouths drop just by listening to her. I just don't get why the songs she recorded are so restrained. Take Kim Yeonji from Seeya, this is a singer who gets the power ballads to show off her strong vocals. That doesn't happen a lot with Sonnet Son, To Love Again is the only power ballad I've seen her release, unless she's on Immortal Songs 2 and then we get to remember why she won Voice of Korea.

When I saw the [Spotlight: Pristin]( https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6u2d7a/spotlight_pristin/) post a while ago, I thought that I'd love to write a similar post about NCT so here it is. Idk if this is useful, but I had fun writing this up (except for adding the links, that was hell), so I'll even be happy if just a few people can make use of it :) Sorry that it turned out so long and that there are like a million links. Also sorry for basically copying the way this post is structured from the Pristin post haha...

Edit: Just so you know, this post is just facts (and a few subjective opinions of mine lol). I didn't include any speculation (or even plans that SM have actually talked about) like future units etc. because I feel I am not informed enough about it and it's a different discussion that would be too much for this post (but you can discuss it in the comments or make another thread about it or whatever).

#Intro

NCT is a 15 member group from SM Entertainment that debuted in 2016. The name NCT stands for Neo Culture Technology, which is a term coined by SM Entertainment to describe the concept of a group with unlimited members and subunits that are based in several cities in the world, which is why more subunits and member additions are expected in the future. The name can also be read as N City, which is why the fandom name is NCTzen (NCT + citizen).
The group NCT as a whole does not promote or release music together. It's just the ""pool"" of members from which certain members can be picked to create a subunit. One member can be part of multiple subunits. So far, NCT has three subunits: NCT U, NCT 127, and NCT DREAM.

[**NCT U**](http://imgur.com/a/IkRQb) debuted in April 2016 and consists of Taeil, Taeyong, Doyoung, Ten, Jaehyun and Mark. They've released two songs, The 7th Sense and Without You. NCT U is supposedly a rotational unit,  but there are no details known about that since they haven't had a comeback yet.

[**NCT 127**](http://imgur.com/a/CU7ma) debuted in July 2016 and is a subunit based in Seoul, which is what the name stands for (127 is the longitude coordinate of Seoul). It consists of Taeil, Johnny, Taeyong, Yuta, Doyoung, Jaehyun, Winwin, Mark and Haechan. They debuted as seven members and Johnny and Doyoung were added before their first comeback in January 2017. NCT 127 have released three mini albums with the title tracks Fire Truck, Limitless and Cherry Bomb.

[**NCT DREAM**](http://imgur.com/a/KrJrD) debuted in August 2016 and is a subunit for the underage members of NCT. It consists of Mark, Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Chenle and Jisung. They have released one single, Chewing Gum, one single album with the title track My First and Last, and one mini album with the title track We Young. They've been promoting as six since My First and Last because Jaemin is recovering from an injury. NCT DREAM is a graduation unit, meaning that once a member is no longer underage (most likely in Korean age), they are no longer a member.

#Members

The members do not have official positions in the group (lead vocalist, main dancer, etc.), so the positions assigned to them in this post are based on what they most often do and are best at. Sorry if this seems subjective. The ages are in international age. For every member, I've included an album with a photo from each promotion (debut/comeback), some other favorite photos of mine, and two predebut photos. :) Also sorry if some of the fun facts aren't that fun, I couldn't really think of anything else lol

#Pre-debut

Before NCT debuted, all members except Renjun and Chenle were part of SM's pre-debut team, SM Rookies. Hansol and Kun were also part of SM Rookies and did activities with the members that are now in NCT, but the two of them have not debuted yet. (That means the [""original"" male SM Rookies](http://imgur.com/a/1slUC) consisted of Taeil, Hansol, Johnny, Taeyong, Yuta, Kun, Doyoung, Ten, Jaehyun, Winwin, Mark, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin and Jisung. [(Lucas and Jungwoo](http://imgur.com/a/ZkJpg), who have been part of SM Rookies since spring 2017, were not part of SM Rookies with the NCT members)

SM Rookies mostly released YouTube videos of them [practicing,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lEmYyQv4jE) [playing games,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA3ZQY5QgTY) [celebrating ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDXBnteX-HQ) their [birthdays,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlHBErJ3Q6c ) [promoting their concerts,](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL7WcuhKPGDgXIP47K7DNJdQ52L8T2YQD) [celebrating Halloween,](https://youtu.be/CXL2eIEg0Cc ) [behind-the-scenes of photoshoots,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RJNhN3n9i4) etc. If you look for SM Rookies on YouTube there's a lot more stuff. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/96VWk) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/KdTZ9) are some photoshoot pictures they've released.

In 2014, some SM Rookies members took part in EXO's show EXO 90:2014 where each EXO member filmed a music video for some popular K-Pop songs of the 90s. SM Rookies performed on the show a few times and some members appeared in some of the MVs that were filmed:

[Chanyeol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy-duVOOIvA) (Hope by H.O.T.): Jaehyun and Yuta are in the video while Doyoung and Jaehyun sing/rap some parts of the song

[Suho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0DiHrJSfUs) (To Mother by G.O.D.): Ten is in the video (at 1:26 and 1:42)

[Sehun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsQmvSVdSbc) (Yo! by Shinhwa): Johnny and Taeyong are in the video

In 2015, the NCT DREAM members that were in SM Rookies (Mark, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Jisung) were part of the cast of Mickey Mouse Club with the female SM Rookies. They and a few other SM Rookies members performed some nice covers there, for example: [Under the Sea,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7lvyMifWq4) [A Whole New World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuB05WaYYg4) (Jaehyun &amp; SM Rookies Herin), [You'll Be In My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWUvOQODJgI) (Haechan), [Beauty and the Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRB5b3U0_cE) (Doyoung &amp; SM Rookies Koeun)

Before debut, SM Rookies had a few live shows in Seoul and in Bangkok where they performed mainly cover songs and dances, but also a few self-written songs. Some examples: [Hide &amp; Freak (only dance),](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Su2jazgbE) [Can I Kick It (only dance),](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWaqT2dNkAk) [View,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05xMerUATt4) [Mirotic,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFkwmeOfME) [Switch,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BCRUewBgcs) [How Deep Is Your Love (only vocals),](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn360YQcC3U) [Open The Door,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qHULntxhfM) [Under the Sea,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPhVAWgKWU) [It Won't Stop (only dance)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Z_RdtXHG4)

In February 2016, Lee Soo Man gave a [presentation about future SM projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky5NvWsXnn8) such as the concept of Neo Culture Technology, SM Station etc. [Here](https://youtu.be/Ky5NvWsXnn8?t=979) is a super dramatic and somewhat creepy 3 mintute long introduction of NCT with some SM Rookies/NCT members, [here](https://youtu.be/Ky5NvWsXnn8?t=1588) is a performance by them, and [here](https://youtu.be/Ky5NvWsXnn8?t=1903) Lee Soo Man starts introducing the group NCT and its future plans.

In between the stuff going on in the New Culture Technology video with Lee Soo Man, there are three NCT teasers shown that were also separetely uploaded to YouTube: [The Origin,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pszw2Wp6BS8) [Synchronization of Your Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaVbeIFQIZQ) (which features Taeyong, Hansol, Ten, Mark and Jaehyun dancing to an earlier version of The 7th Sense with additional vocals by Haechan), and [7th Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFMSpKYTSxs) (Winwin showing traditional Chinese dance).

#Reality Shows

**NCT LIFE**

NCT LIFE is NCT's own reality show that has 7 seasons so far. All seasons (except for the last one) are available with subs on VLIVE and YouTube. Each season has either a unique location or a concept, but the majority of this show is the members eating, playing games and goofing around, which is probably why my descriptions of the season sound so boring (also because I haven't watched some of these in months and can't remember the details), but I promise they are not.

[**NCT LIFE in Bangkok**:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg3HYWm_7qcmz7BfYa_oixwa4fd1jO25f) Johnny, Taeyong, Doyoung, Ten and Jaehyun visit Bangkok, where they give some interviews, photoshoots and visit Ten's old school. Then the other SM Rookies members (except Winwin and Kun) arrive to have their SM Rookies live show (concert) together. At some point they all sit together and watch video messages that they recorded for each other.

[**NCT Life in Seoul**:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLih3idqlIUS240Sq9xsf0KzwmY-zw0MGx)  Taeyong, Yuta, Kun, Doyoung, Jaehyun and Winwin split into two teams (Team Aigoo: Taeyong, Yuta, Winwin and Team Hanwoo: Kun, Doyoung, Jaehyun) and get missions that they have to win against each other. At the same time, they tour Seoul a little and stay the night in a traditional Korean house.

[**NCT Life**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-5ppgN6VKUogMmwFABQ3LBmIt4v6Gq4x) (in English referred to as NCT LIFE in Paju): Taeil, Taeyong, Yuta, Jaehyun, Winwin, Mark and Haechan (= NCT 127 before Johnny and Doyoung joined) spend two days and a night at a traditional Korean house. They get to plan how they want to spend the day and go grocery shopping together. The rest is really just eating and playing games.

[**NCT LIFE **](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYnfY2fK9ZDiy0x9UWPwxHfkmGIib-h5N) (in English referred to as NCT LIFE K-Food Challenge): Taeil, Taeyong, Yuta, Doyoung, Ten, Jaehyun and Winwin are taught how to cook certain meals by a professional chef. After cooking their own meals, the chef rates each of them and ranks them according to how good their meal was. Ranks 6 and 7 are eliminated and become the assistants of Ranks 1 and 2 in the next round. This goes on until the final is just two teams with a leader each competing against each other.

[**NCT LIFE  **](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiGnBUUA5ZK2OD-8vbTPXpwqcouksbIty) (in English referred to as NCT LIFE Entertainment Retreat): Renjun, Jeno, Chenle and Jisung are split into teams and each team has a Super Junior member as a ""team manager"" (Chenle, Jisung and Super Junior's Shindong vs. Renjun, Jeno and Super Junior's Leeteuk). The point of this season is that Shindong and Leeteuk teach the guys stuff about entertainment and variety but it's pretty much also just playing games and eating.

[**NCT LIFE in Chiang Mai**:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxvl_wqvYdn5W-zag4Qrx9mw4Krkd1EFQ) Johnny, Taeyong, Doyoung, Ten and Jaehyun travel to Chiang Mai and do some tourist-y stuff like riding on elephants and visiting a temple.

[**NCT Life in Osaka**:](http://listography.com/daltaeil/links/osaka) Taeil, Taeyong, Yuta, Doyoung and Winwin go on a trip to Osaka, Yuta's hometown. Yuta planned the trip and plays the tour guide, so this season also has a lot of tourist activities.

#Subs

A few examples of good subbers are: [NEO Subs for NCT,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7uIefmvytOyutRk51_9Uzg/videos) [_NChina-lineT_,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfmZs-xajer7RYJOqAJqVEw/videos) [NCT lover2,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwAAT7rHlvYIl5nYqNI8Kug/videos) and [shbup.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEyAYRLmnSnBR-avyWZONFg/videos) They're all very yood but especially shbup subs short videos (like the Boy Videos) in lightning speed. Their YouTube channel has been suspended before so they have uploaded some subbed videos elsewhere, [here](http://listography.com/daltaeil) is a link for those.

Many more subbed videos can be found on [nctsub.tumblr.com.](http://nctsub.tumblr.com/)

#Social Media

NCT usually don't make most their own social media posts themselves

Hello, this is Choeun Ent.

We are writing this to address the issue on the official colour for 24K.

Because the group is named 24K, we originally had plans to make our official colour pure gold, however we will be using two golds: Glitter gold and Yellow gold. There is another fandom which has raised concerns as their fandom shares a similar colour: Pearl metal gold so we have changed the official colours.

The colours we have selected have been chosen carefully to not overlap with another group's official colour so we will be going forth with the two-tones. Even though a fandom has raised objections on similarity in colours we have decided to accept  it and we are apologizing for causing the confusion regarding official colours.

We will be making a decision on the new official colours for 24K and will announce this at a later date once everything has been determined.

* This is the second installment of the official 2017 r/kpop playlists that will showcase user submitted songs. So basically these playlists will be made by you guys! 

* All you have to do is comment your suggestions and ill add them! **Max 3 song suggestions per person!**  

* Try not to repeat songs that other people already suggested. 

* These playlists will be put on YouTube so feel free to follow them.

This weeks playlist will be **Ballads**!

* These are those songs that make you cry tears of sadness or tears of joy. Ether way, they really get to you.

* They can be new or old.

Here are my contributions -

* [Crush - Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5TJcaHO2gU)

* [Taeyang - Eyes, Nose, Lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bjm920Fyo34)

* [Taeyang - Darling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9auADmPjV_w)

[Ballads playlist here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk7lxwDRFgduzSBEuc57uvPO-AduULd9G)

Notes - 

* Even if the week is over, I will still gladly take suggestions whether it be in the comment section or in a PM.

* The playlists will be alphabetized by group and soloists. 

* It would be much easier on me if you include links to videos that you want in the playlist. MVs without intros or breaks are perfect. So basically uninterrupted goodness. Otherwise, just link a lyric video. If you cant link a video, dont sweat it! :)

* If you have suggestions for future playlists, feel free to let me know!

Today, I am happy to announce that the following bangers have finally made it to Apple Music, or have been reuploaded after a long absence:

* **T-ara - Sugar Free** (+ dozens of remixes!)
* **T-ara - So Crazy**
* **T-ara - Little Apple**
* **Dalshabet - B.B.B.**
* **Dalshabet - Joker**
* **Dalshabet - Be Ambitious**

If I notice that any other major songs have popped up, I'll post them here.  

Apple Music is still missing major BEG songs (Abracadabra, Kill Bill), SNSD's Japanese releases, some newer 4minute, and the entirety of AOA's Heart Attack EP (which it used to have). If T-ara's more recent stuff has finally started popping up, lets hope those will, too. ",6,20,False,self,,,,,
