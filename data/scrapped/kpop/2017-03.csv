    New Rules!

A popular theme from you guys when you message the mods is that you want clearer rules about what is allowed and what isnt as well as more consistent moderation.  We understand that its frustrating when you make a post and it gets removed, but you dont understand why.  We hear you.  A couple of weeks ago we got a bunch of great feedback about changes to [group-specific content rules.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5u7q8x/new_rules_for_groupspecific_content_feedback/)  We really appreciate that feedback and we made changes to those rules based on your suggestions.  Additionally, that was only a small part of the larger rules overhaul that were announcing today.  Here are the new rules for r/kpop:

#### [NEW SUBREDDIT RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules)

The goal of these new rules is to both clarify the old rules and take a firm stance on some issues that were previously fuzzy or inconsistent.  Most of the rules are still the same policies as the old rules just with clearer language, but there also a few **new policy changes** that should be noticed.

* I.A.5 - Multiple segments or performances from a show should be submitted as a single self-post with all the links compiled inside whenever possible.

&gt; Multiple submissions from a single show feels a bit spammy, so wed like to clean that up.  Instead of having five different segment threads for Weekly Idol or six different performance threads for Golden Tambourine, we would like all of these links to be compiled into one self-post.  We understand that sometimes only one segment or preview is released all by itself.  In that case, its okay to post it, but whenever multiple clips are released simultaneously, please collect them all into one submission.

* I.A.7 - Official teaser images and announcements must be rehosted on imgur or reddit image host. Multiple images should be collected into an album. Image posts from Twitter are forbidden.

&gt; Simply put, Twitter is a terrible image hosting platform, especially for multiple images.  We would like ALL teaser and announcement images rehosted on either imgur or reddit image host.  Not only will this make viewing them a more enjoyable experience, but it will also preserve them in case the tweets are later deleted.

* I.A.12 - Solicitation is forbidden. Submissions offering to buy/sell/trade merch, concert tickets, or albums are better suited for r/kpopforsale. r/kpop is not affiliated with r/kpopforsale so use it at your own risk.

&gt; In the past we have allowed some submissions offering to sell stuff, but we feel these submissions are not appropriate for r/kpop.  Reddit does not offer any sort of buyer protections, so buying and selling on Reddit can be dangerous and result in people being ripped off.  As mods, we dont want to be in the middle of these transactions and we dont want to seem like were endorsing them.  As the rule says, we are not affiliated with r/kpopforsale so use it at your own risk if you so choose.  If you want to be safe, use eBay or another site that is better equipped for transactions.

Please read the entire new rules carefully and give any feedback you may have about the above changes or any of the other rules.  These rules are not carved in stone and we will be revising and improving them whenever we see an opportunity to do so.  We are always working to make the sub better for you guys, but we also need you to tell us if we accidentally make it worse.  Although we may not respond to every comment, all of your feedback will be read and considered.  We promise you that.

&amp;nbsp;

    Teaser Spam?

Everyone loves getting hyped for new releases, but it feels like kpop artists are releasing more and more teasers with every comeback.  At what point is it too much?  Do you think the current rate is too spammy, or is it fine?  We dont have any sort of solution in mind and were not even sure if its a problem, so its something thats really up in the air and were just hoping to generate some discussion on it.  So let us know how you feel about the amount and frequency of teasers on r/kpop.

&amp;nbsp;

    Revisiting Winner/Comeback Stage Posts

Several users have given suggestions that we should revisit our policy on limiting music show posts to only the wiki and single discussion thread.  Would you like to see the daily music show winner announcement return to its own discussion thread separate from the show thread?  Also, how would you feel about allowing the very first comeback/debut stage to be posted separately?  In this case, were talking about only the very first stage, not the whole first week of stages.  We think the current wiki system is working very well for compiling and preserving the music show performances, but we are always willing to revisit policies and make changes when appropriate, so tell us what you think.

I think it's the combination of soft  female vocals against cold, electronic textures that get me. That contrast seems to bring out an extra soulfulness. I guess there's an element of nostalgia to it as well being a child of the '80s. I'm a big fan of Carly Rae Jepson's Emotions as well of course though I think K Pop does it even better. This stuff is like crack to me!

    ULTRAHARDCOREMAXIMA :

Edit : Adding a comment for level standardization.

Edit #2 : Whoaa, This is more than what I anticipate. First of all, you guys awesome. I understand that an easy dance could be medium or even hard ones for others, vice versa. And I also understand that every human is different. Some are quick-learner, some are very athletic, some maybe had a stiff-as-rock muscle and had zero flexibility, etc2.

But let's think this way. Imagine a person who never dance in his/her life, and want to try to do dance cover. 

He/she doesn't know where to start and doesn't know if his body able to do things that professional dancer could do or not.  

People like that (\*cough\* like me \*cough\*) need guideline and a limit. 

Its like, ""Oh, I *felt* I could dancing well, but I never try but still want to do a dance cover. So, *&lt;insert ultrahardcoremaxima coreography here&gt;* absolutly isn't my level yet right now. But maaybe if I able to master *&lt;insert superbeginner choreography here&gt;,* my body and mind is ready for learning  *&lt;insert easy choreography here&gt;*, and if I able to master that, maybe I'm ready for the next level."". And so on.

And I'm really sorry I my wording and grammar offend you all, not a bit in my intention. English isn't my native one.

* Brave Red Dino - Kim Seyong (MYNAME)
* Brave Gold Dino - Lee Seyoung (Cross Gene)

It is probably no coincidence that they chose a cast that has experienced extensive promotions in Japan. Apeace and DGNA have been promoting exclusively in Japan for years.

The show will premiere this year and run for 12 episodes.

Article: [Power Rangers Dino Force Brave Announced for South Korean Broadcast](http://tokusatsunetwork.com/2017/02/power-rangers-dino-force-brave-announced/)

&gt; South Korean company, Daewon Animation, has announced its latest production, *Power Rangers Dino Force Brave*.

&gt; Daewon Animation has brought Korean dubs of Super Sentai shows to South Korea for over a decade, each given their own unique Power Rangers title. The 2013 Super Sentai series, *Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger*, known as *Power Rangers Dino Force*, sported the most successful Power Rangers toy line for the South Korean market and grew to massive popularity within the country.

&gt; In response to the popularity of both the show and toy line, a new series titled, *Power Rangers Dino Force Brave* has been announced. The 12 episode series is expected to air in April and is advertised as containing the first Korean cast in a Power Rangers series.

[This guy breaks it down well:] (http://io9.gizmodo.com/south-korea-is-basically-making-officially-licensed-pow-1792791872)

&gt; For the last decade or so, South Korean company Daewon Animation has brought Super Sentai shows to the country by simply dubbing the original Japanese series in Korean, and then slapping a new Power Rangers name on itweirdly enough, usually different from the names used in the Western Power Rangers adaptation. Except this year theyve announced theyre basically doing it Western style, creating the first Korean adaptation of Super Sentai everand its actually a sequel to a previous series.

&gt; Over the weekend, Daewon confirmed that its next Power Rangers project would be *Power Rangers Dino Force Brave*a 12-part sequel series to *Power Rangers Dino Force*, a dub of the 2013 Super Sentai show *Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger*, which itself came over to America back in 2015 as *Power Rangers: Dino Charge* and *Power Rangers: Dino Super Charge*. *Dino Force Brave* was immensely popular in South Korea, so instead of simply adapting another Sentai show, Daewon decided to make an all-new continuation of the show, featuring new suits for the Rangers, new megazords, and pretty much all-new footage using Korean actors in and out of the suits, since they already used all of the original footage by dubbing Kyoryuger as is. So basically exactly how we do Power Rangers in the West, but in Korean, and as a continuation of a previous show.

I have a weird assignment to do for college. I need to write a 20 page paper on a topic that was discussed during a colloquium event. The most recent topic presented was how Far Eastern media (movies/tv shows/etc.) merge western culture into their own. We were shown a Chinese music video where the singers were dressed up as Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe in some scenes and in traditional Chinese clothing in others.

I was thinking about writing about how k-pop music videos show the same thing: a merging of the East and West. What would your recommendations be? I was thinking along the lines of Blood Sweat and Tears and its connection to Demian by Hermann Hesse and things like that as an example.

I could use some help because I think this would be a fun paper to write.

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

I'm giving away a free A-pink wall scroll. My brother went to Korea a while ago and I asked for a Miss A poster but he forgot what kpop group poster I asked for and just got me something with something the letter A in it. I like the group enough but I think someone else who else is a really big A-pink fan would like a free wall scroll.
I wasn't sure where else I could post this so if this violates the rules, please remove. I really had no idea where I could give out free kpop swag.
It's slightly crinkly but still really pretty to look at and it's actually kinda big. I have no space for it so I'm mostly looking to give it away by tonight or so

WOW this blew up a lot compared to what I worried. Thank you all for kind words, hope I quenched some of your curiosity.


~~I gotta go eat something now, but will return if you guys leave any more questions!~~


~~Returned. Outside was too cold, gotta jump back into my cozy room!~~


~~I gotta sleep now, thanks all of you! If you have any more questions, I will try to answer them later!~~


Awake, but not gonna stay all day on computer/phone so answers might be late~

Edited - Fixed formatting


Re Edited - Some typos


Re Re Edited - Some groups added

* Hi, I am a lurker on Reddit who is currently on mandatory 2 year service in one of Airforce bases, who just randomly wanted share my experience with how various K-pop groups/solos are viewed in army. Hope this is relevant enough not to get removed.


* I am currently on a break, and decided to make this to have chance to talk about stuff you guys mihgt have been curious about. 


* Do NOT take my words here to be representative of whole Korean and/or soldiers here though, things may or may not be different in army/navy and in different bases.


* NOT going to answer politic-related stuff. You'll have find a different guy for that.



***
**Some stuff I want to clear**
***



* Before I got into service, I had little interest in K-pop or even music in general (usually listened to some recent popular rock). BUT after I joined I became crazy interested in various girl groups. (common case for many)


* I have lived in US for couple of years, so while I can write/read English, I might make some mistakes. ~~Deal with it~~ and would be happy to fix any typo or grammar mistakes if you point them out.


* My personal favorite groups are Gfriend (Yerin especially) and Lovelyz (Kei especially). Recently liking April and Oh My Girl too.


* Most liked to listen songs are Rough from Gfriend and Destiny from Lovelyz. 


***
**How we Korean soliders react to K-pop**
***


* Mostly through TV (has internet-cable) that is in each room(dormitory?), we usually watch Music shows such as Music Bank/Show Champion/M Countdown and variety shows. Rewatching good live performances and shows with girl singers in them is common.


* A lot listen to K-pop with MP3 (which is allowed as long as it does not have any wireless connection) and using computer service (we can use it after 'work time' is over for free, though it is limited to 2 hours at once)


* Some buy music from legal sources but many just pirate it. Very few buy physical album.


* Not much of merch bought, but some do buy posters and calendars.


* Most do not take part in official fandom(s)



***
**The popularity rank among soliders** I made from general opinion - Will add more


(Might do popular member in each group list later on)


(Inactive/disbanded groups (ex: Girls' Day or 2NE1) are not in the list to keep it from getting too messy)
***


**TV channel changed instantly**


* Majority of boy groups (which is expectable in army)


**Might as well as watch as TV is on**


* Gugudan, CLC, DIA (the 3 unfortunate post-I.O.I groups)


* Momoland, Ladies Code, Hellovenus, F(x), T-ARA


* SNSD (AKA Girl's Generation), Wonder Girls (both were previously goddesses groups but now their popularity has declined. Some hardcore fans do exist though.)


* SEVENTEEN (Surprise to many, but many dudes like them because their songs are 'funny')


**Going to change channels to watch**


* Red Velvet, Blackpink, Dreamcatcher, Sonamoo (Cool unnies/girl)


* Laboum, April, Oh My Girl, ~~Space Girls~~ Cosmic Girls (AKA WJSN) , Lovelyz (Cute aegyo girls)


* ~~Bing~~Big Bang (The most liked 'boy group' by guys)


**Going to plan TV watching time to see them**


* EXID, AOA, 9Muses, SISTAR (4 queen groups of sexy), 


* Mamamoo, Apink, Davinchi (the talented 3 groups) 


* AKMU, IU (not really girl groups but just to show non-groups can be popular too)


**Untouchable Goddesses**


* Gfriend, Twice  (People will even rewatch ads if they are in!)


* Previously I.O.I too - Produce 101 was HUGE here.",277,428,False,self,,,,,

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

The idea to allow the first comeback/debut stage to have it's own post outside of the music show thread received almost unanimous support.  As a direct result, we will be implementing that change starting tomorrow with MTV's The Show.  Remember, this only applies to the very **first stage**, not the entire first week of comeback/debut stages on every show.   

We know that we have a lot of users who browse on mobile and may not ever see the sidebar, but there is some really great content in there that everyone should be more aware of.  First, we have re-tooled and expanded the music show archives (ex. [Inkigayo](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/music-shows/inkigayo), [Music Core](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/music-shows/show-music-core), etc.).  These archives are one of the great benefits to using the wiki for music shows and we think they will be a valuable resource for going back and reliving some of your favorite performances.  You can find links to all of the archives in the sidebar by clicking on the icon for each music show or visiting the [Music Show overview page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/music-shows)

Additionally, the [Upcoming K-Pop Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/2017/march) button in the sidebar is an amazing place to stay up to date on the newest releases and see what's coming out soon.  /u/dessidy and /u/tastetherainbeau do an outstanding job keeping that page current and we really appreciate their efforts.  We also have the [K-Pop Events](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/events) page over there that tracks upcoming international concerts and festivals.  As we move into spring and summer, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop) if you know of any events that we can add to the list.

Lastly, we're pleased to roll out a new weekly feature starting today, [""K-Pop Monday Q&amp;A - Ask Anything.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5xt5xw/kpop_monday_qa_ask_anything_march_6_2017/)  There was a large question and answer thread a few weeks ago and one of the suggestions made there was to have a weekly Q&amp;A thread where people could ask simple or silly questions.  That sounds like a good idea, so we're launching the feature today.  Check it out and ask your questions.  Of course, you don't have to wait until Monday to ask your questions, r/kpophelp is open 7 days a week.

Again, thanks to all you guys for making r/kpop a great community with quality content.  If you have feedback or concerns about the subreddit, you can [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop) anytime.  We're always open to new ideas and suggestions to make r/kpop a better place.",19,123,False,self,,,,,

Gfriend's recent song is a little bit the opposite that its ranking really well on all other charts, which makes you think about why haven't they been doing better on Melon?

There are also so, so many issues with racism, colorism, and cultural appropriation



I definitely listen to kpop primarily for the music. Still, it's hard to divorce the art from the artist and agency. And with so many new fans coming in - many of which are super young and impressionable - the Hallyu effect is getting more and more influential.



At first, I thought I would only financially support groups from agencies that treated them right. But then I felt conflicted because I wanted to give those groups more support and love. Plus, I ended up being a huge fan of SM artists so... arg matey




Is it morally responsible to be vocal and financially active kpop fans if it continues to push sexist, racist and homophobic attitudes? Why do we accept all this? How do we reconcile feminist beliefs and anti-hate progressions while continuing to support an industry full of social flaws? 




Do we call idols and agencies out and hope they eventually change their way? Is that enough? And is there something I don't know about to help push forward acceptance within the kpop industry and community? 




TLDR: since there are so many social flaws (sexism racism etc) in the kpop industry that end up affecting viewers, how can we as kpop listeners live with that? 




EDIT ALERT : I removed the bits about Mamamoo because it was missing the point I'm trying to discuss. 



Not that I'm trying to act like that conversation isn't worthy in general, but I think people can go to the post about it for that, and there are plenty of other things I'd rather discuss here. 




Sorry to change the post



EDIT 2: I don't have a right answer and and when I say ""I"" or ""you"" or ""we"" it's simply for the sake of argument. Just giving what I would write in this post to start off the discussion. I hope that's not too confusing, sorry if it is :)",107,134,False,self,,,,,

Recently, after the Nu'est members' appearance on Produce 101 Season 2, I wondered why they don't enjoy as much success as their juniors SEVENTEEN. This is the first time that I have seen this in KPOP. Also, it seems like luck is a major factor, at least in the cases of EXID and GFRIEND. (Both groups are extremely talented but fancams helped them gain attention.)

So, basically, if you were the CEO of a mid-level entertainment company, how would you go about ensuring your group's success?",21,7,False,self,,,,,

He had recently uploaded a photo to his Instagram prior to deleting all the photos. The photo contained a bloody hand and a knife, fans aren't sure if this is Roh Jihoon's hand or a stock image. There's no screenshots of the photo though but a couple fan accounts.

-------

Yesterday, Roh Jihoon tweeted a message jokingly telling fans that he had important information and they should vote for him but then later ""jk'd"" and said that he was too old to participate on Produce 101 and wasn't taking part in the show. Prior to this, a lot of his fans had asked Roh Jihoon if he was going to participate on the show, saying he should try.

I was surprised to find they've never had a concert (they've done variety shows and similar but never a dedicated aoa event) but I was lucky enough that my trip to Korea includes their first and only concert date! 

It's a one night only deal and because I know AOA well I was able to write down the set list. I'll throw it in the comments.

Then there are groups that slowly build up from the bottom until they finally get their hit song... Not to mention those that never make it big at all. 

So my question is, how much weight do we give to a strong debut? I've seen instances where an unsuccessful debut results in a group being called ""flops"". Is there a path that's best? ",52,59,False,self,,,,,

Have you noticed any defining qualities to their production, especially those who've been at it for awhile?

I'd love to hear some of your favorite mashups or mashup ideas involving kpop songs (either with other kpop songs or with non-kpop songs)!


Some other ones that I've thought of:

[BTS' *Fire*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALj5MKjy2BU) x [Fergie's *L.A. Love*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLyP0B2Q-R4): If only because the ""la la la la la""s fit together so perfectly.

[Gugudan's *A Girl Like Me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQxtwvLUByM) x [The Pussycat Dolls' *Don't Cha*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSxNsr4wmA): These songs just fit together so well both in terms of the theme and the song structure.

[San E and Raina's *A Midsummer Night's Sweetness*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkfMN-jaycA) x [*Walking in a Winter Wonderland*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkFP0VwpPRY): Part of the chorus of San E's song is a neat twist on the melody of Walking in a Winter Wonderland, so I think they'd fit together quite nicely musically. The winter/summer juxtaposition would also be fun.

Also, upvote for other people's submissions that you like best. The person whose submission has the most upvotes by Sunday 11:00pm EST will have their theme chosen for next week. 

Submissions should be submitted as comments and should include the artist, song title, YouTube link to the MV or audio if possible, an explanation of your choice if you wish to provide one, your theme request for next week, and a description of your theme if it seems too vague. For example: 

&gt;[BIGBANG - Fantastic Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbokV76tkU)

1. Songs submitted should be Kpop songs. Songs that aren't in Korean but are by a Kpop group are accepted. Songs from Korean OSTs are also valid. 

2. Only one song submitted per user. 

3. You cannot submit a song that somebody else has already submitted for this week.

4. You can submit songs that have been submitted in previous weeks, however you cannot submit a song that has already won.

5. If your theme request is too vague, please add a description.

6. Your theme request cannot be specific to one artist (e.g. ""Songs by [this group]"" is not an acceptable theme).

Is it ok that the victims come online telling about that what the singers did? Should they do that online? Why can't they do this outside of online? In court, talk in person, etc.. How do we know what is true and what is not?  Should we automatically believe these rumors?

Is it when you watch all of their music videos? Watch their variety/reality shows? Can name all the members? Buy a physical album? 

I personally only started to refer to myself as an Inspirit/Ahgase/Tinkerbell when I started adding their entire discography to my iTunes library, learning all the members names, and watching every video of them I could find, subbed or not. 

Im also doing my Asian Studies minor thesis on dynamics between fans within individual K-Pop group fandoms and the K-Pop fandom in general and Id really appreciate it if youd all take this [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCKqRLiDApUvdCvIj8SReiYjRGzl5z3-I7s6DIL5IsN5OSHQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) that goes further into depth on relationships between K-Pop fans in the fandom. I have my own observations but Id love to get as many perspectives as I can. Thank you so much for the help!

EDIT: Wow thank you so much everyone for responding to my post! I got way more answers than I thought I would and I really appreciate all of your help and insights. I didn't expect for everyone to respond so strongly to the fandom name part of my question.

___

From the groups I stan:

**Miss A**: Suzy. Suzy already so many fans, when Miss A had their latest comeback they called it a Suzy comeback. Min gets a lot of hate in particular, Jia was bashed a lot her contract ended, how she never offer a thing to the group (not true). Just like with next examples, it's easier to find haters of the rest of the group when one member outshines them popularity wise. She is my bias too, but I also like the rest of Miss A. 

**f(x)**: Krystal and Victoria. Formerly Sulli too, when Jinnabit was around, she the worst akgae of all. I felt like most people who were glad Sulli was ""going down"" for her pictures on Instagram were not the general public as NB posts seem to make it, but akgaes of the other members, especially Krystoria. Sulli is actually getting endorsement deals after endorsement deal, so she is doing fine. Happy for her and she was not even my bias in the group.

**SNSD**: Yoona and Taeyeon, formerly Jessica too. Yoona and Taeyeon has always had the largest fandoms within the group, being known from the general public as well. Jessica had some high profile akgae (i.e. fansite admins) so that left quite an impression. Well, the others did too, but it looked like Jessica had the most from twitter dramas. Though most recent twitter dramas have been from Seohyun akgaes.

**Secret**: All but Hana, who is the main target. They have more fans of individual members than group fans.

**TWICE**: Fan favorites are different in Korea and internationally, this is one of the most divisive groups I'd say, largely due to their multinational nature. That said, I've noticed Jihyo is often the target of akgaes everywhere. What did she even do that makes so many people angry? 

* Related but one of the reasons I have heard why Twice has so many Thai antis (see their videos like/dislike ratio, that's them; in twitter #twiceanti tag is almost exclusively Thai) was that Natty fans in Sixteen (who is Thai) were pissed she wasn't chosen for Twice. Natty was 13, none of the under 15 contestants were chosen, they were never meant to be, it's illegal by Korean law for them to work and they were just filler for the show. The other reason I have heard was that a Twice stan pissed off Exo stans there.

Disbanded groups:

**4minute**: Hyuna. Frankly, the group was known as 'Hyuna and her backup dancers' the disparity in popularity brought a lot of akgaes.

**2NE1**: CL and Dara. Minzy was targeted a lot, but then Bom's scandal made things shift towards her. She is still blamed to this day for ""what happened to 2NE1"" (being under YG's management is what happened to 2NE1).

**IOI**: All of them, it's just the nature of how the group was formed. That said, Sohye is targeted more than others.",219,163,False,self,,,,,

Artist and Company|Designation|Genre/Concept|Description
:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
[Jiae, Goldenhind] (http://imgur.com/PIg3ovT)|Female Soloist|Country|Jiaes debut single [The Giving Tree] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZZxYmpxnlU) is refreshing to listen to and even though it was released in September it fits the perfect description of a spring day melody. Im going to place a safe bet and say that everybody knows about The Giving Tree. Based on the lyrics, it seems as if Jiae is singing from the trees perspective (I could be way off). On another note, Ive never actually heard a Korean country song before so I didnt know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. Jiae greatly suffers from lack of exposure but with the right amount of support I could see her having a good career in country/indie as her voice is soft but its soothing quality fits the song. **Edit:**This might be the Jiae who left T-ara but I'm not sure.
[Ants, Munhwain] (http://imgur.com/sn8YTiA)|Co-Ed Duo|Funky Indie Pop|Ants had a very impressive debut with the track [Pretty] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_o7_8Uxt-4), and an even more impressive EP Ants Say to go with it. Dohjaes voice is very soothing, sort of like Owl City. Choi Yoo does the composing and the lyric writing, and together the two make a great musical team. In January 2017, they released the mini-album [Just 10 Minutes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhcdwWY-Q4c).
[MADE, S-made Entertainment] (http://imgur.com/TDxM11q)|Male Group|Vocal Performance|MADE is a new vocal group that is sure to brighten your day the minute you listen to their music. All three members are all former members of disbanded boy groups: MEKID was known as Minki in the group Airplane, and Jiyong and Sung Hwan were both members of the short-lived boy group Attack. They debuted with the single [He Turned His Head] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9UQ4d7npPs), and released three other singles, [Talk Talk Talk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgcZ-Xw6s4), [You and Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94BVqQ-2zC8), and [Beautiful My Girl] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jmhllUIuR4).
[SF9, FNC Entertainment] (http://imgur.com/Bpp7az9)|Boy Group|Dance, Pop|So far SF9 has had a successful run as one of the few (and I mean *few*) boy groups that debuted in 2016. They officially debuted with [Fanfare] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPJ73QUG0MY), but the public got to know them as NEOZ Dance through Dance or Band, FNCs survival show where they were up against NEOZ Band. They also released [So Beautiful] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEPRgPPclkg), a promotional single for their web-drama Click Your Heart. Most recently, they came back with [Roar] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whfKIuRKFMo), the title track from their first mini-album *Burning Sensation*. Last note: Their [dance practices] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwCryJtqWSob3YHOFod6-H16_FjkKP98g) are a beautiful sight to behold.

Also [What U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGci3RbaTdc) has heelies incorporated in the choreo which is super fun.

I'd heard about them through Co-Ed School, but I never looked into them, and now I seriously regret it. I can't believe I'm so late to the party.

Artist and Company|Designation|Genre/Concept|Description
:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
[Tae Hwa, Creativist] (http://imgur.com/XEzI0QR)|Female Soloist|Trot|I think Tae Hwas title track is called [Love Like X] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbbnwRVA1vE). It comes complete with a ballroom-themed music video and everything. I was confused the whole time.
[Bolppalgan4, Shofar Music] (http://imgur.com/GkN4pJr)|Female Duo|Indie|At this point evvvveryone knows about Bolppalgan4/Red Cheek Puberty/Blushing Youth (whatever name you call them). I was enamored with their debut song [Fight Day] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ri7I32Auhg), and I was literally hoping that they would strike a few fans. Fast forward months later and theyre Indie Rookies of the year, all thanks to the blessing that is [Galaxy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U8uA702xrE). Thats what Im talking about. Aside from the musical heaven that comes from Jiyoung and Jiyoons combined ultra-talents, I think Im drawn to them because they remind me of the days when Maroon 5 actually made good music (Ill die bitter). I cant list their whole discography her so just listen to all of it. You better.
[Villain, Planetarium Records] (http://imgur.com/tRL6VJ3)|Male Soloist|R&amp;B|Where has this mans voice been my whole life? Vocally, hes like Heizes male counterpart (*coughcough*Iwantaduet*coughcough*). His official description is absolutely correct: he **is** the next R&amp;B genius. Even his [cover art] (http://www.mnet.com/album/1700122) is genius. Villain debuted with the single [Rainy Night] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ7kj6pxkrg) and left fans wanting more (like full-album level more). His first feature was on Jung Jinwoos [Open House] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yobO5ZMAzuE).
[Dorothy, leek.mill] (http://imgur.com/OlNBLjS)|Girl Group|Mature Dance Concept|Dorothy is one of those groups that popped up out of nowhere from a company that no ones ever heard of, but despite this, the group had one of the highest quality debuts in 2016. [Purple Lips] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZw4tLGgyjU) was definitely a mature concept done right. Jiyu, the leader, has already locked down a duet with Heo Seokmu with the song [Karma] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pXPFnXsuA4). Unfortunately, Danbi had to leave the group for personal reasons, but Subin has joined Dorothy. Theyre in the midst of preparing their second album.
[Fantastie, In Entertainment] (http://imgur.com/o8suovt)|Girl Group|Sexy Dance Concept|Fantastie is comprised of the duo Double B (they disbanded to join this group), a former member of both Cupid and Honey Girls, and the maknae and sole Chinese member, Haeun. Their self-titled mini-album, Fantastie, has two songs: [Dodo Girl] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqdgOAzsPpE) and I Feel Good. Both songs are actually pretty good, however the groups choreography is nothing short of predictable). I Feel Good actually has a summery feel to it and I wouldnt be averse to a special summer-themed dance video. [Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUQZKPLARf0) is a showcase performance of both songs.",9,31,False,self,,,,,

And for the incumbent fans, it was a song that most just couldn't get into and didn't like or don't listen to as much as their other releases.

Feel free to incorporate whatever elements you want to include into the definition of ""good"". 

-----------------------------------

For me, after browsing a little, have realised that most OMG fans don't really like A-ing, however, for me, it was A-ing that got me to check out the other OMG songs (which I admit aren't really to my taste, unfortunately....). Although I do admit that the rap feature in A-ing was terribad and really ruined the flow of the song for me (don't kill me but I actually used an audio editing software to cut the rap feature out :x)

Another group and song is GOT7's Hard Carry - seems like most IGOT7s don't really like it but it was the song that caught my attention and made me check their other songs out!

So, did you guys notice anything similar happening with other songs/groups?",68,34,False,self,,,,,

So basically Euna, as I'm typing this, is livestreaming on instagram with another ex-The Ark member. She explained what happened with the ark and how before they couldn't get back together but now there is a chance somehow that they will reunite(that's more or less what she said in English, maybe she explained it further in Korean). Hopefully someone uploads the livestream to youtube.

This song, however, is not an original song by BYT, it is a rip-off of ICIA (formerly SIDA)'s debut single from October 2015 called ""It's You"". It's not even just a rip-off cover, they have literally just downloaded this song off the internet, renamed it and put it back out there, claiming they recorded this when their upload uses SIDA's vocals! Any negative comments left on their YouTube channel are continuously erased and ICIA have not granted any permission for this song to be used, especially not like this. So far, BYT's agency have yet to release a statement on this but questions are also rising about BYT's other song ""Hello"" and if it is really an original or also a copy of someone's song.

I was posting the debuts by the month of release but things were way too confusing(finding more debuts, artists coming back)
  
**This list does not contain soloists or subunits of previously debuted groups, and most pictures will show only the current line-ups of the groups.**
  
**Note:** If anybody wants Facebook/Twitter/Instagram information about any of the artists, just ask me and Ill send you what I have.
  
Artist and Company|Designation|Genre/Concept|Description
:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
[Beby, Muse E-Shop] (http://imgur.com/pWchz0f)|Female Soloist|Island alternative (sort of) |I dont know much about Beby but I do know that she has a bright smile and a melodic voice. Her debut song [Happy Days] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zCz2l_KwWs) has a tropical/island quality to it. Once in a while she posts [song covers] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFKa69gL364) on her [Youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnNtCRbxei-wI56gzRg8Zlg/videos). 
[Jinhyuk, Dragon Drug Entertainment] (http://imgur.com/HOOLcjZ)|Male Soloist|Rap, Hip-Hop|Jinhyuk debuted with [Sound] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZRlExubHbI), which sounded disjointed in most of the vocal portions. I did enjoy the deep-voiced rap mid-song (I dont know if this was Jinhyuk or one of his featured artists). The one thing I learned about Jinhyuk is that he grunts a lot (cue song title). 
[Sodam Kim, Madeleine Music] (http://imgur.com/wgKs1l1) |Female Soloist|Ballad| Kim Sodam may not offer anything new to the world of Korean ballads except for her composing skills and lyrics, and thats more than enough for me and I sure it will be for some others as well. Her debut song, [Wind] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAC4ipDRQOc), had a typical standing in the midst of the trees music video but I really like her latest single, [You Colored My Heart] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjF_XhUj5QQ). One thing that Id like to point out is that shes got a quiet voice and I wish shed project it a bit more.
[Jinah Kwon, Antenna Music] (http://imgur.com/03yxvtB) |Female Soloist|Soul, R&amp;B, Indie|Ive heard of Kwon Jinah multiple times and shes been recommended to me to listen to, but I never actually listened to her, embarrassingly not even to her [duet with Sam Kim] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agIG5q6rGGo). I knew she was a young vocalist however (almost a year younger than me), so when I finally listed to her debut album, [One Strange Night] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLicr9CtAAwdfJc7sGd0sNuRg-jLvymBPM), I was blown away by how powerful and emotionally heavy her voice is. The whole entire album is a gem, and theres not one filler song on it, plus it features [Babylon] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFoEoQIA2ms&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLicr9CtAAwdfJc7sGd0sNuRg-jLvymBPM) and [Jay Park] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-OMtFDkwEc&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLicr9CtAAwdfJc7sGd0sNuRg-jLvymBPM). This is the music video for the title track, [The End] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOgsp64fw0M).

Last week there was no episode due to broadcasting revisions made because of the impeachment.

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

I went to KPOP night out and it was awesome! I got into the venue around 6:45 and initially had a spot really close to the stage. I'll kinda give a run through of all the acts I saw.

Warning: This is long and possibly incoherent because I'm tired.

**Big Phony:**  
He was honestly adorable and charming. He started his set with ""Hi, I'm Big Phony and I sing sad songs."" He was a great performer. He made lots of jokes - one of which was about how he needed to take his morning dump. My highlight of the night was when he walked past me when he left the venue. I told him he did a good job and he gave me a knuckle tap.

**No Brain:**  
They started the hype. The lead singer had so much energy; he jumped around everywhere, he interacted with the audience and got everyone to cheer and sing. He took of his top and that made everyone scream x) One of their last songs was about drinking soju, so one of the band members started pouring soju for audience members (I didn't get any though).

**Galaxy Express:**  
They sounded great, but I felt kinda bad because the crowd was pretty mellow during their performance. People only cheered after each song. The group didn't really interact with the crowd, so I think that is why the hype died.

**Drunken Tiger &amp; Yoon Mirae:**  
I'm going to combine these two because there was a lot of overlap between their performances. They were both on stage during each other's set, but the focus of the performance was based on who was scheduled to perform. It was LIT! Everyone was screaming and jumping. There was a lot of fan interaction. Tiger taught us Korean, like how to say I feel f*ing good xD They brought Bizzy and other members of Feel Ghood Music that I'm not very familiar with; they were all great! Along with their songs, they also covered some hip-hop songs, like So Fresh, So Clean by Outkast and Doo Wop by Lauren Hill. The crowd was so crazy that I had to leave my spot during the break between Tiger and Yoon Mirae's because I felt I was about to pass out from heat stroke. That wasn't too bad because I found out that one of my Korean friends came with her parents to watch everything and sat with them (her parents really wanted to see Hyorin, but sadly they left before her set.

**Hyorin:**  
So during the intermission between Yoon Mirae and Hyorin's set, a cleaning crew came to wipe down the stage, which delayed her set by about 10 minutes. It was awkward because when they first played her intro to go on stage and everyone started cheering, the cleaning crew came out (it kinda reminded me of that episode of Spongebob where the crowd starts cheering when Spongebob mops xD) However, when she finally got to perform, it was amazing! She performed Paradise, a dance mix of One Way Love, Ma Boy, and ended with a cover of Bang Bang. She was a great dancer and her voice was phenomenal!

**Red Velvet:**  
Unfortunately, I didn't get to see all of their set. Since it was getting late, I left a little early so I could make sure I got home safely and cheaply (if I would have used a ride share app, it would have cost about $50-$60). It didn't help that their set was delayed by 15 minutes :( But from what I saw, it was great! The songs I saw them perform were Russian Roulette and Something Kinda Crazy. I think they were about to perform Lucky Girl when I was leaving; I was surprised that they were performing more of their B-sides. The girls were all very cute! My bias is Joy, but Wendy really caught my eye. They talked to the fans between songs and asked what everyone's favorite song was; the crowd shouted Dumb Dumb (I yelled Automatic). One of the members (I think Wendy) sang a little bit of Dumb Dumb. I left a little bit after that. I don't know what other songs they performed, but I'm pretty sure they also sang Rookie because that was the only song that the organizers used to promote them. 

Overall, it was a fun experience. Would probably do again!

Edit: RV performed Fool, not Lucky Girl.",38,104,False,self,,,,,

Level one in this case: A true beginner to K-Pop. Thinks it's all 'weird chinks' and 'weird shit', so you don't want to make it...too crazy. You can't hit them with the Ring Ding Dong's and the ChurrUp's just yet. You have to ease them in.


I also tried to steer away from disbanded groups i.e. 2NE1, 4MINUTE. Whilst they're always good Gateways, if you know, by random chance manage to send this person down the rabbit hole, a group to stan is always nice. (RIP).


There's always one, for that friend that was always really into anime: **[Dreamcatcher's 'Chase Me'](https://youtu.be/zihoyz0u_cs)**
&gt; This song really wouldn't seem out of place as an anime OP. When this came out, I was watching Re:Zero at the time, and thought that it seemed fitting for the atmosphere of that particular one, though I'm sure it fits the criteria for many others. Plus, it goes against the general vibe that is often associated with K-Pop, so alternatively, it can be used to break the stereotypes for the skeptics.


For the ones that cry that 'Kpop is all based on autotuned gimmicks!!!': **[It's OK - BTOB](https://youtu.be/f4rN5Y7Dx_I)**
&gt;Alternatively, if you prefer girl groups, Mamamoo are a great alternative to use here. BTOB really break the stereotype that all manufactured groups are 'all visuals, no talent' and prove with members such as Minhyuk and Eunkwang that actually, they can be both. Once you recover, and catch your breath again from their vocals, they'll try to floor you again on variety. Funnily enough, Mamamoo try to monopolise the three V's too. Proceed with caution.

For the ones that think 'hey, it seems cool, but idol raps? Hm': **[HOLUP! - Bobby](https://youtu.be/-Tap_zZdkYA)
&gt; Alternatively, most songs by Zico or G-Dragon. Whilst the best route would obviously be K-Hip Hop, K-Pop and KHH are entirely different genres, just as rap and pop are in Western music. As far as the new generation of idols go, Bobby is leagues above others with his rap, and Holup! showcases what he's made of, as well as being a generally fun song. It is also a good gateway to the full album from MOBB, which in turn introduces someone to both iKon and Winner, without any ugliness. 

For the one who is kind of sceptical of lots of people dancing in sync, but is still here for some good music: **[I - Taeyeon](https://youtu.be/4OrCA1OInoo)**
&gt;Girls' Generation are the gateway for many into K-Pop, but for an absolute beginner, 9 (or 8) girls singing and dancing together can be pretty daunting. But what's a reason we fall for SNSD? Taeyeon's powerhouse vocals. This song showcases her vocals perfectly, as well as providing something different to the typical bubblegum pop, giving us a mellow rock track. Verbal Jint provides a decent rap too, adding a unique sound to the song. Plus...come on, she's beautiful. Can you resist that smile?

For the one that is pretty aware of what they're going to see, but they still want less crazy, and more just an enjoyable, long ass ride: **[The 7th Sense - NCT U](https://youtu.be/3UGMDJ9kZCA)**
&gt; When this song was first released, for many it was love at first listen. It was different from the norm, but man, it went off. This song incorporates a lot of the great aspects of K-Pop: box MVs, synchronised tight choreography, unique fashion and sharp visuals, along with a lot of other unique aspects. A good rap? Check. A bassline that would work for a little bump and grind? Hell yeah. A sound that is definitely kpop, but wouldn't sound out of place in the West? Yep, it kills it. See if they can resist a couple of body rolls of their own.

For the one who knows that Kpop is famed for cute boys, and cute boys they shall have: **[Dope - BTS](https://youtu.be/BVwAVbKYYeM)**
&gt;Pretty much the quintessential song when introducing someone to kpop now. Again, it incorporates the aspects of kpop that it's known for, such as the synchronised dancing, but isn't too overwhelming. BTS are obviously known for the easy transition from Western to Kpop, so it isn't too far fetched to enjoy their music. Of course, there are plenty of boy groups with great songs and great visuals (see: EXO), but I figured a group with a pretty average amount of members works well here. Plus, who doesn't like a guy in uniform?

For the one that knows that Kpop is famed for sexy girls, and sexy girls they shall have: **[Shake it - SISTAR](https://youtu.be/x9-TIy7WPQI)**
&gt;You try and get that opening hook out of your head. Of course, Sistar are the representative for sexy girl groups in kpop. Whilst other groups may trend for a while, everyone tunes in everytime the Queens of sex appeal come back. This video definitely accentuates their famous features, but remains enough of an ear worm that the listener is likely to come back and eventually...they're going to get curious. They also hopped on that Harley Quinn trend, and we all know that's a winning step to winning someone's heart.


Let me know what you think. I didn't include a load of super famous groups...hell, I didn't include any of my bias groups. But I think this songs would work well for an absolute beginner~
 
Suggestions and criticisms welcome, will be doing higher levels later on.

&gt;Q: You look very natural when laughing, and it feels like your personality is also very bright. What would be the word that best describes your personality?   

EJ: Before, I would always answer *bright* (in English), and my personality really was simply bright.  
But I'm not sure about now.  

&gt;Q: Why? Do you not always feel *bright*?  

EJ: As I work more, I seem to realise my other side. And I had a very depressing year last year. I felt empty and lacking, even with winning no1 in chats with my first solo 'Hopefully Sky'. and I was the one who always believed that hard work pays off..  

&gt;Like the power of positiveness in &lt;Secret&gt;?  

EJ: Yeah. I thought I had a very strong power of *positiveness*, but I just didn't wanted to meet anyone new, and even run away when I see someone, since I couldn't control my feelings last year. And I always liked meeting new people while drinking a bit. But then again, if I stayed alone, sad thoughts came into me, and that's when I first realised my other side.  

&gt;Did it get better with time?  

EJ: Well I tried very hard to overcome. I tend to dig deep when I'm into something. And I really couldn't find the end when I tried to dig deep into the emotion of 'depressing' 

&gt;Some do say that those feelings help musicians and creators...  

EJ: Sigh.. It really, really didn't help me at all. I even had times where I wrote lyrics with the feelings and ideas I had, and was surprised by it. For me, it feels like thinking about being depressing and writing about it really kills me.  

&gt;Maybe that's because you clearly show your emotions. You are okay now right? 

EJ: It did get a lot better after I got my own studio. I learned how to compose from composer oppas, and started to learn piano again - and I think I became more tough - maybe more brave. 

&gt;That seems like how musicians would overcome their difficulties. You sang the OST for  and   live on Facebook today: do you watch dramas often?  

EJ:  Well I didn't really watch dramas a lot. But I watched almost all dramas on air last year - I really need that killing time to stay empty as I was very depressed. 
I really wanted to cry bitterly, but as I do have a lot of self respect/ego, I didn't want to cry infront of anyone else. I just couldn't accept myself being miserable. And that's why I blamed the dramas for crying. It was a good media to release my feelings. I literally cried thorough the entire *Dear My Friends*.

&gt;Female idos must be sensitive about their age. But I guess you sometimes do feel good about getting older right?  

EJ: Well I really never cared about getting old. I always go *how old am I?* when others ask me. And I would say something when my friends go *wow we are old now* - we were only alive for 25 years, what kind of nonsense are they talking about - you shouldn't  say those stuff unless you are dying the day after that. It'ts not like you'll cheer up by saying that anyway.

&gt;Love and relationship is a big issue for the 20s, can we expect something like that? 
  
EJ: I think I'll tackle that when I get older. As I was feeling depressing last year, I realised that I had a lot to think about at my age. I want to sing a song that can be relaxing for the people of my age.

Im sorry. Such is life. I have been very busy. REAL WORLD YAY! 

Anyway, SM posted the notice for this recording on that Saturday [March 4] and I was in the city out with friends. After dinner, I went to SBS Public Hall and got my number. It was nearing the 300s and I was worried since there was a 280 person alotment. I also saw on the notice that they would be performing Dunk Shot. That meant a new fan chant for all of us to memorize!!!!!!!!!

I got to Inki the next day and got in the line and received my number [248]. Even though I hate waiting in line a lot, I love the tier system a lot. After we got our numbers and they put the date in our fan cards, they told us to be back by 1 pm. My friend and I went and got lunch and then came back. We got in line right by the building and got our fancards officially checked. We then waited to go over towards the building. While waiting, members from Victon were in their car heading back to their dorms or next schedule and their fans were waiting on the sidewalk and waving to them. Their car was stuck at the light so they rolled their window down and started talking to fans. Its was adorable. 

Our NCT Dream lines moved towards the Public Hall and as I was waiting to go in, JINYOUNG OF GOT7 WALKED OUT OF THE BUILDING TO THE CAR WAITING FOR HIM AND I WAS TAKEN ABACK BECAUSE HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!! I couldnt think for a second when I saw him. SO BEAUTIFUL. Fan support went around telling us how to do the fan chant because we had motions. The start of the chant was really fast as well so they went over it with us as well. 

We started going inside and I got inside right when the rehearsal take began. We all rushed to our seats and I was in the exact same spot I was the last time I was at Inki. I wasnt able to see into the dressing area as much as before but in between takes I noticed how tall Jisung was. 

We had one rehearsal take and three actual takes. The choreography was just adorable. In between takes, fan support was telling us what to do with the fan chants since we had the motions to do as well. Since the motions happened at random spots, they tried to change it and see which way was better for the finger wiggling. Yeah. We had to wiggle our fingers and clap along. 

The PD also told us not to be so loud because of the microphones all over the studio. We looked up and saw microphones above us. So we, the ones sitting down, had to try to contain ourselves from the cute. IT WAS SO HARD. Right before takes, the boys were constantly messing around by pretending to play basketball. Before the third take, the boys were as usual playing basketball and Haechan dabbed. I pretty much lost it. Also, Marks rap was so fluid. Like okay there son. This is also when I realized Mark Lee was my NCT Bias List Wrecker. It took me awhile to get there but it kinda hit me in the middle of one of the takes. Plus the choreography was just so adorable that we lost it every time. There was one part when they had to scrunch up their faces and I swear every single one of us died. DIED. 

When it finished, we all rushed outside since there were other groups needing to have recordings done. Everyone got out their phones outside and started screaming. Not only was the recording super adorable and the boys super adorable, but we were so proud of them. It sounded like a bunch of kindergarten moms seeing their kids perform for the first time. I was so proud of them leaving the recording. Proud mom right here. The public reception of Dream has been very positive. People are seeing our children as talented up and coming kpop idols. IM JUST SO PROUD!!!!!!!!!!! Stanning NCT might feel daunting since the group has so many members, but the Dream Unit just has a special place in my heart. Im gonna be proud of these boys for the rest of my life. They are doing more than I did when I was their age. I just really love NCT. And they pretty much are my UB group now. Im in this life for good. ",7,39,False,self,,,,,

Ahn Somi is a 2000liner. She's Korean, but kfans have been saying she used to live in Hong Kong. She also was on the same cheerleading team as Doyeon from IOI. She's popular with the fansites in Japan because of her visuals. 

Pictures of Somi yesterday:  [1](http://i.imgur.com/bDW9Rtt.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/wOMJ3p6.jpg) [3](http://i.imgur.com/imbGjbR.jpg) 
[Video of Somi singing ""You and I"" with Yebin](https://twitter.com/chs_1716/status/843375381243617280)


Lee Jooeun is known from her appearance in KPOP STAR 2. She's a 95liner, and I'm glad MBK found a great vocalist to put in DIA because the group doesn't have any real power vocalists.

Pictures of Lee Jooeun yesterday with DIA: [1](http://i.imgur.com/7QdPUWT.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/ibk3dMt.jpg)

Bonus: [DIA performing Umbrella acoustic in Japan](https://twitter.com/WGnomi/status/843371199908470784)


DIA went busking around Tokyo with their new members and they are also filming their new music video in Tokyo with the new members. MBK has not formally introduced the members and I expect Somi to at least get a stage name lol. International fandom is obviously very wary of this because of MBK's past idiocy, but Korean DIA fans are more than intrigued. It's never a dull day stanning an MBK group.

Anyways, I'm working on organizing my *overflowing* Korean music folders and decided to start a [mind map](http://imgur.com/w64rpc3) as a quick reference guide to all artists and companies. (I have plans to expand on what's included later, but right now just getting the basics down is most important.)

I want to share the project, since I think it can be useful to others, but as I obvious don't know everything about every group, I will be needing to ask for little bits of help along the way too. For example: I have MinX/Dream Catcher done right now, but I'm not sure if Jiu's real name is Minji or Jiyoo as I've seen both on KPop profile sites. Also, is it Dream Catcher or Dreamcatcher? Little stuff like that as I'm only covering very basic info I can mostly find myself. 

I'm using the program XMind to do this and people will need to download it in order to read the notes (it has a free version), but it really isn't a requirement - depending on how big the map ends up being of course as I'm not sure how big/clear I can make the images lol 

So, yeah, wanted to share this project, but also want to make sure it's ok to post about it here too. If not and people are still interested, I will be posting it to my [tumblr](http://novadestin.tumblr.com/post/158473168129/happyface-ent-minxdream-catcher) as well.

&amp;nbsp;

However, something interesting that I've noticed is that stylists tend to dress idols in jerseys often based off of a color scheme or visual theme, meaning that sometimes you get things like [this Twice performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFBf4joVnjc), where the girls are wearing Miami, Houston, Detroit and Chicago jerseys, but Jihyo's jersey said ""Avengers"", Dahyun was a proud attendee of Premier Skills Camp, and Momo's shirt just said DERRICK ROSE.

&amp;nbsp;

Since color over unity is emphasized, what are some of the more unique or surprising teams/universities that you've seen represented in kpop? Has anyone's alma mater been represented in a particularly amusing way?

For big groups, while they tend to be more flexible and can offer a lot more visually, I think the downsides far outweigh the pros. For example, for me there's less desire to stan a group when I have to learn 12 different members, and I can never tell who's singing.

I generally like small groups (3 to 5 members) much more as they tend to seem more close knit, so watching vlogs from them or shows is much more rewarding. I can get much more invested in each member amd choose a bias without thinking I'm missing something. They're easier to remember and much more fun live, I think.

This being said I still do like some larger groups, like EXO, BTS, and the soon to debut Pristin.

As I continued to listen to it on repeat for the next hour, it got me thinking about what might be That Song for other groups.
That Song that defines the groups sound, that is revolutionary in (or out of) the fandom. That Song that, when it comes on shuffle, you listen to it on repeat or turn it all the way up in the car. That Song that you would go to the concert just to hear it live.
Its not necessarily your favorite song or a song *for the fans*, or even their biggest hit; its just so iconic for that group.

Most people would agree that for Infinite it is The Chaser, but heres my opinion on some other groups:

* TVXQ: Mirotic. Duh.

* Bigbang: Haru Haru. Absolutely. Both the original version and the ballad version they do live are just so great.

* SHINee: Probably Replay tbh. Its just so ~SHINee~

* 2ne1: I am the Best

* SNSD: Im torn between Gee and Genie. Gee was so iconic, but DJ, put it back on

* Beast/Highlight: Fiction

* MBLAQ: Im trying to stay away from my internal bias of 2012 (aka the best year in kpop), but This is War was just so epic. If not that, then Mona Lisa. I need other A+s to weigh in on this.

* B.A.P: 1004. I love how much they experiment with other styles, but they really struck gold here. It was kind of poppy without losing their sound.

* VIXX: I want to say Voodoo Doll, but I dont know if thats my bias talking. Starlights help me out.

* Exo: Growl. It blew up for a reason.

For Winner and iKon I think the sample size is too small still :/

Zhang Liyin took time on her birthday to host a live video streaming event with fans, during which she confirmed that her contract with SM Entertainment will end this April 2017.

&gt;Its been a long ten years for Zhang Liyin and her fans. During the live chat, she thanked fans who have supported her throughout the years, particularly fans who have been by her side since she first debuted with Timeless. As a gift, perhaps, she sang a short clip of Timeless in Korean for fans chatting on the live stream.

&gt;Liyin explained that her first single post-SM Entertainment is currently being planned. She will return to Beijing with her golden retriever dog, Beyonc  now weighing between 40kg to 45kg!  and she will stay in Beijing as she develops her career in China.

&gt;She seemed very relaxed throughout the video, and said she felt very fortunate that she was able to celebrate her birthday with family members. It was the first time in many years for her to be with family on her birthday. Liyin brought out a chocolate cake that a fan gave her for her birthday. She even ate it on camera!

&gt;With all the cover songs she has released in the past couple of months, Liyin spent a few minutes talking about the Goblin drama soundtrack. Her favourite song from the soundtrack is Beautiful, originally sung by Crush. It seems like she is in the middle of recording a new Korean song for her fans too! Liyin explained that she has a small studio at home, where she spends time recording new songs.

&gt;Liyins mother showed up off-screen during the live stream as well, but did not make an actual appearance. Fans asked after Liyins grandmother as well, to which Liyin replied and said she is currently downstairs watching television.

&gt;At the end of the live stream, Liyin cheerfully sang Happy Birthday to all her fans, wishing them all a happy birthday  even if it wasnt their birthday just yet! Her acapella version of Happy Birthday was very pretty!

credit: http://chocolyn.org/2017/03/zhang-liyin-confirms-sm-entertainment-contract-ends-april/ and to OH user gayness for even letting it be known more.

&gt;Finally free from SM dungeon. Hope she gains success after this :/ been under SM since 2003, barely accomplished anything for the past 13 years of her life. Her youtube channel if yall interested https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTgeDDElMPIgwPkV0Eq_6gg/feed

Soompi translated that article [here](https://www.soompi.com/2017/03/21/22-popular-hallyu-celebs-china-revealed/). It was conducted by using the popularity/hits/views of hashtags that exceeded 1 billion on Weibo. I know opinions on this sub regarding views (ex. YouTube views) are divided and it's arguable just how accurate views can be used as a measure of popularity, but nonetheless it does give some indication as who the most trendy/popular idols are in China, at least on social media/Weibo. It would also at least be interesting to see how the most popular idols from this survey compare to mainland Chinese celebrities who are ex-kpop idols (ex. Luhan or Jia). 

It's a survey of the most popular Hallyu Stars, but since this is a k-pop related sub, I just decided to list all the idols/groups that were in the survey. If you're interested in who else made the survey: Nam Joo Hyuk was 7, Lee Min Ho was 15, Gong Yoo was 16, and Song Joon Ki was 22. I don't know if Hwang Chi Yeol counts as an idol, but I decided to include him anyways since he's a musician/singer. I just thought this would be interesting to post, since there's such a complicated and tense dynamic/relationship happening between China and South Korea right now, so that tension may/may not affect the idols listed below, depending on how much star power they pull in China/each individual situation. I know Lay, Victoria and Jackson all have sizable fanbases in China, so we'll see.

Anyways, here's the list:

1. EXOs Lay
2. EXOs Sehun
3. EXOs Chanyeol
4. GOT7s Jackson
5. EXOs Baekhyun
6. Hwang Chi Yeol

8. BTSs Jungkook
9. f(x)s Victoria
10. BTS
11. BIGBANGs G-Dragon
12. EXO

I have to create a fictional company and a friend and I thought of a kpop online store based in europe, which would mean: 
- slightly higher prices for the company to buy the albums, but lower shipping prices to you guys 

Where do you get your K-Pop related stuff? Albums/Merch/anything
 - What do you hate/dont like about the shops you are ordering from right now?

I legit talked about the *whole* concert from start to finish.

Alright so this is my first fan account AND it was my first concert ever, and the fact that it was SHINee too oh my god; spare me if there's any errors/inconsistencies I'm still trying to comprehend the night haha. Left my house at 4:30 or so to get to the theater they were performing at; about one hour transit from my house to the place total and I'd be two hours early before the concert so I thought I'd be pretty early. Only once I got to the theater the line was already *massive* looping around like what, two street corners? At the entrance of the theater was just a giant mesh of people giving away/selling SHINee photo cards, shirts, light sticks, etc. (Kpopme couldn't get any official merchandise which is a shame). Being the broke boy that I am I walked right past it and got myself in line; couldn't strike up a convo with the people next to me cause I'm shy but oh well. All I could hear from around the first corner was random yells and cheering every so often.  

After a half hour or so a person who worked at the theater came up to my part of the line and got our section to move to an opposite street corner because two lines were being made from separate directions and they needed to make it one for a clean entrance once they opened the theater doors. While moving I was able to catch a glimpse of the SHINee flash mob while they were dancing to Lucifer so that was pretty cool.  

After standing for like another solid half hour they finally opened the doors! Got my bag checked, ticket scanned and I was in...sorta. They let us into the theater entrance but the actual doors to the seating was still closed. At first it was no big deal but by 7:15 I could hear some people around me were getting a bit anxious about the concert starting late. The theater PA went on around that time telling everybody there was no need to line up in front of the doors to the seating and to look around the theater itself, take photos, etc in the meantime but nobody around me was really taking that offer, everyone just wanted **in**. 5 minutes before the concert is supposed to start PA again goes off saying the doors will be open soon, so it looked like the concert was going to start a bit late.  

They finally let us in at 7:35! All the seats were already set up with some banners for Shawols to hold during the concert. Found my seat pretty quickly and got myself all set up and ready. My seat was the very first row of the P3 seats at the lower balcony so I had a [pretty great view]( http://i.imgur.com/YlfrgFT.jpg) of the stage for the price I paid! And by some crazy odds both Shawols next to me were guys! ...granted they were both with their girlfriends but that's beside the point lol.  

Before SHINee was even out people were going crazy at the songs that were being played in the meantime (especially Tell Me What To Do, shame they couldn't perform it but it was understandable). The actual concert didn't start until 8 which is when they played the first VCR, Fairytale. It was a story about our princes SHINee and how a witch woke them up? Gets pretty weird afterwards (going through a bunch of interdimensional doors and stuff) but eventually they defeat the witch by pretty much spraying her with rainbow goo from super soakers. First songs of the concert started right after with Hitchiking, Why So Serious, and Juliette. Juliette had a Key dance break which I wasn't expecting which was pretty cool.  

Afterwards SHINee introduced themselves and all of that talking about how it was the first time in Vancouver whatnot. The camera zoomed in on the members and panned it on the screen behind them. They were just *glistening* in sweat already. Key and a side translator did most of the English speaking; random fact translator really liked to use the word **passion** while translating cause SHINee says we're full of it haha. We held up our [welcome banners]( http://imgur.com/a/xFXdY) at the time which they saw and Jonghyun tried to read out loud in English which was cute. They also talked about how they liked how ""antique"" the theater was and how it was a new thing for them; Key also mentioned how he enjoyed how close the stage was to the fans, where he then proceeded to walk to the edge of the stage super close to the people in first row (lucky lucky Shawols). Once the intros were done SHINee had Onew present the next song they were going to perform, Prism.  

This track is probably in my top five SHINee songs right behind Symptoms and the fact I was able to see it live was amazing. Love the instrumental part at the beginning from the teaser, it's so soothing. Theatre went crazy during Key's part, you know which one. Really makes me wish the song was longer.  Right afterwards we got a semi-acoustic(?) remix of Replay which was really nice, started with them standing into the choreography halfway through. Next VCR was something along the lines of them getting having a picnic into a fancy dinner with it ending on a slow motion shot of them wearing some very good looking suits.  

Next songs performed were Hello, Odd Eye, and Feel Good. I think it's a crime to have such a cutesy song like Hello be followed up with the sexiness of Odd Eye but that's just me. Feel Good really got the crowd going and the fan chants were getting louder and louder. The way the stage lights went off with the fog rolling into the stage for the start of it made it so much better. The VCR after was a visually trippy dance medley of a lot of their popular songs that jumped from different solo members.  

Afterwards they performed a Sherlock Remix that was pretty hype where once the song ended the backup dancers got their own dance break (they had four backup dancers for the concert) which felt odd at first because of how they left the middle of the stage empty, but man those dancers went IN. Everyone was hyped as fuck. Lights went off for a bit afterwards. Cue them turning back on and fog machines filling the stage and Taemin in the center with an exposed chest and his loose shirt with the long fringes. **Ohhhhh boy**. Goodbye was shortened but it was amazing. Just to think I was watching what I originally saw on Hit the Stage live was for lack of a better word still, amazing. He looked super tired afterwards though which had me a bit worried cause you could also sort of see how drained he was getting in the next few stages after.  

The moment it ended he went off stage and the other four members came on and started performing Ring Ding Dong immediately. Was a bit confused that they'd start without Taemin but he rushed onto the stage literally right on time for his first part of the song LOL. Near the end of the song there was a music malfunction and the sound cut off but luckily since it was the end all the Shawols were able to fill in for them. I'm actually glad the malfunction occurred cause it was a pretty cool moment and the only malfunction of the night for the most part. Funny thing is the moment the music was set back up it was already a few seconds into Lucifer so Onew had to start singing his part instantly haha. Hearing Jonghyuns signature high note and seeing him do it live was a sight to behold; the man looked like he was frozen in time while holding that note (and pose). Lucifer also had a godlike Minho dance break, which included a pelvic thrust he did that so hard its as if his life depended on it; the whole theater went **insane**.  

This time no VCR but SHINee talked to us while they took turns changing outfits (first to leave were Key/Minho). Jonghyun mentioned about how the weather was nice in Vancouver, where everyone laughed in return because of how it was raining on and off a few hours beforehand. He then specified more talking about how in Korea the air's polluted so the fresh air here was nice and allowed him to sing to his fullest (cue the *awww :c*). Taemin confirmed that he was a bit on the tired side but not to worry because the last stage woke him up completely and out cheers gave him strength. Jonghyun also talked about something along the lines of that it was lunch in Korea right now so they'll be performing with a full stomach? I don't even know/remember LOL. Once the three of them left and Key/Minho took their place oh my god. It was like a horrible but hilarious comedy skit where Key kept asking Minho questions in English. Fav question was probably the first one where Key asked *what did you do yesterday?* and Minho simply answered *...I sleep!*. Minhos (or I should say all of their) English is just lovely, hearing him say things like *Is a rainy day* just makes me smile. Key asked what song we wanted to here from them and he focused in on some people on the first row saying *Wait I want to hear what they're saying*. Then he went *What? Shame On Me?! OH STAND BY ME!* It was great. Once they came back Key teased Taemin a bit asking what was up with his shirt, turning him around showing a giant rip in the back which was exposing a good chunk of his well, back. More crazy screaming. Then it was ballad time.  

Selene 6.23, Aside, Invisible Umbrella, and Please Don't Go were the ballads. All very nice ways to slow things down for a bit. Invisible Umbrella had English lyrics shown on the screen in the background and the Onew x Jonghyun duet was beautiful, the background image was a very colorful space shot with stars shining. The next VCR was Shift which was sort of like a POV day with SHINee. Lots of fan service in this one with SHINee feeding/giving gifts to the camera and whatnot (not to mention Minho gesturing to get in bed with him).  

View was the song up after. This was probably one of the highlight fan chants of the night because the fan chant is very straightforward and easy. One of my fav SHINee titles do was absolutely stoked when they finally performed it. Songs were speeding up too with Ready or Not and Saviour right after. I swear Onew was spinning so fast during Ready or Not I couldn't tell if he was just pretending or legitimately dizzy LOL. Song was fun also with SHINee bouncing the word *GIRLLLLL* back to us every time. Saviour had lots of crowd interaction too with them telling us to clap and bounce whenever the pre-chorus/chorus hit. I never saw the full choreo for it and it's just a really fun song with a lot of little things happening here and there. I'm probably biased since it was my first comeback with the group but Everybody right after though *had* to be one of my fav songs of the night. Went that bass hits during the chorus it hits **hard**. The choreo and crazy high notes live is just something else completely (I had a good birds eye view of Onew's helicopter arms LOL).  

Next was the infamous Woof Woof VCR! DAMN it was hilarious throughout. It felt like everyone especially loved Minhos push up scenes but the whole thing is just so funny. It was a good VCR transition into the 1 of 1 stage and OH MY GOD THEY WERE WEARING THE MV SUIT OUTFITS. Granted they were just the different colored suits but it felt so *real* seeing it live, felt like I was seeing their [comeback stage]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q-09GX4X2U)/MV in person (which I was). Dream Girl right afterwards was equally impressive with seeing Onew do his mic stand flipping live with another infamous Jonghyun high note.  

Sadly once this stage ended they talked about how it was time to say their goodbyes. Mentioned how it was tons of fun and how they would want to come to Vancouver again (Taemin said he'd make sure to study up on his English before then). They also mentioned the [encore banner event]( http://i.imgur.com/GyDbODr.jpg) we did at this time too which was nice. Key also talked about how the name SHINee means how we reflect on them/give them light (which was sweet) and how it was a nice name that was given to them thanks to their CEO; Minho then proceeded to do a shoutout to SM LOL. Taemin presented the last song in English which was of course An Encore (or how he pronounces it, N-core). I forgot to mention how some of the stages had confetti strings blasted into the audience, but for An Encore the confetti was 1000x better. Instead of strings it was small, light and white and it actually reached the balcony! Ending it off with a behind the scenes VCR that at the end had a black screen with a message along the lines of ***Thank You and Love You*** was perfect.  

I'll leave the post-concert out because well nothing really interesting happened I just went home lol. Concert ended around 10:30 and I got home just before midnight. Concert was about 2.5 hours long and had the same set list as Toronto. Apparently songs that were cut from both places included Farewell My Love, Alive, and Trigger which is a damn shame cause I would've *killed* to see all three of those live (they actually wore the [Trigger outfits]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrugLdUBcNU) for one of the stages but I can't remember which)! Couldn't sneak any fancams cause the security around my section was SUPER strict but a lot of people uploaded theirs onto the Facebook page. Overall it was an *amazing* experience and I'm so happy I got to see the group that got me into kpop in person :)",29,79,False,self,,,,,

I mean the whole video seems to be themed around making light of unfortunate events, which I'm not wholly against. It's just... that scene just seems really out of place to me. And I can't imagine the scene meaning anything else. It's not like the building is on fire and she's about the jump. The girl just looks really concerned, and then for the most part we just get headshots the rest of the video of her. I mean I still bump this song, but going back to the video, it just seems like such a strange choice of scene and set. I've tried to figure out if they could be referencing something else, but the scene looks like any movie depiction of someone about to jump off a building ever. I don't want a campaign to remove the mv or something dumb like that, I'm just really curious about what r/kpop's thoughts were on this scene, and if anyone else is as bothered by that scene as me.",15,0,False,self,,,,,

She had purchased me a ticket to KCon last summer for my birthday and I gladly returned the favor. 

Four hour drive. Five hours in line. Two and a half hour concert. Four hour return ride home. It was worth it. If anyone has an opportunity to see them live, don't say no. In line I met fans from Canada and Florida. I thought my travel was far, but they went so much more out of their way to see these guys perform. 

We were close to the second stage on the floor. We got an up close look at their faces and let me tell you, they are better looking in person. I don't want to ruin anything for people at the second concert tonight in Newark, but it was a show to remember.

They are such talented performers and they appreciate their fans more than any other group I have experienced. They put so much work into everything they do. I will see them every time they are in America. I hope they come to KCon NY this year. ",31,77,False,self,,,,,

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

**CONTEXT:**
Im ultra new to the kpop scene, im more biased for metal music, but I always kept my mind open. True Story.
A kpop song poped up on my YT feed 3 or 4 months ago and I got hooked like instantly.
I knew kpop by watching a video from ""Twice"", and that got me to listen to ""i.o.i"", as it was the following one, throughout these months I've been listening many more groups and I loved all of them.

**Question 1: Why is everybody so mean?**
Please don't kill me and be rational!
I've seen it's a thing to cheer for like ""only one group"", so, I watch in YT a lot of hate for bands videos and music instead of enjoying it?
Today I said to myself ""I bet Reddit has a sub for this"". Got here and well, it damn does.
So I started searching for threads of the groups and songs I like and all I got is disguised bad vibes: 
&gt;""They look amazing, the song doesnt""
&gt;""Really good song, they fucked up the video""
&gt;""The song isnt memorable""
&gt;""The first chorus is shit, the following fix it up, but still meh"".
Why is people like this, lol, can just enjoy music and don't spread bad vibes? Or is it that I'm missing something? cultural maybe?

**Question 2: Why groups disband?**
Im from south america and I've never seen not only 5 seconds of the shows the girls ""seem to come out"".
The shows are obviously not displayed on american television, so I only get to watch YT videos.
I've seen, shorthly enough, i.o.i, disbanded because *""the agencies thing""*, and everyone seems to be ok with that....?????????
Can't they just quit their agencies and keep the group alive? They don't have free will? It seemed to be like a succesful ""product"", why erase it?
How does it work?
Can someone actually tell me how the whole process goes and why everybody seems to be ok with that?
Specially that, why is that everyone says ""I love them, hate that they will disband in six months"" and no more has to be said.
Cause as I searched for more info, it happened with a lot of succesful groups that they disbanded or had an ""expiration date"" like 2 days after the release debut, and here I am saying...wtf?

I guess this doesnt need a lot of exposure, maybe between 3 or 4 answers can shut my doubts!
Thanks for reading!

2288,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-3-26,2017,3,26,20,61l4j2,self.kpop,[FAN ACCOUNT] 170311 NCT Dream Show! Music Core Prerec [aired 170318],https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/61l4j2/fan_account_170311_nct_dream_show_music_core/,jolaurence,1490527691,"Here it is. This is my last fan account of NCT Dream and their promotions. It has been a crazy few weeks and this is late by two weeks. Sorry. Life happens.

SM decided to pull one on us by posting the notice for the prerec on Thursday evening and not Friday afternoon like always. I saw the notice at 1 am that Friday and quick jumped into the shower and then set my alarm for 7 am to go into the city to find it. What is sleep? What is adulting? Also, never take the bus into the city on a weekday. Just take the train even though you have multiple transfers. I found the notice, took my picture, sent it, got my number, ate breakfast, and then headed back home for work. The one benefit of it coming out Thursday evening was that I got to go home right away after work Friday. Now...if I looked at the notice board on Thursday before I left work I would have gone right away and could have had a shot at being standing. I WAS SO CLOSE. One day. One day that will happen.

Saturday rolled around and I got there. My check in number was really good and since the allotment was 350 and there is the tier system, I knew I would be getting in. One of my friends was also there and we waited together until we had to get in line. We got checked in, got our tiers and numbers and were told to be back by 10 am. I went and got coffee because I was way too tired and came back. Its support important to not go far away from the venue when you are told to be back by a certain time because if you do and are late by a few minutes, the next check in might be over and you will be out of luck. It happened to a girl that day. We were waiting by the tree before fan support told all of us to go over towards the venue. The ice rink that was there in January was completely gone. This meant more room for fandoms to queue in. 

It was the same usual business. We got in line, were checked to see if we were in the right order, our fan cards were signed, and waited for a while. Around 11 am, our lines started moving. We then walked into the venue and took our seats. I was in the middle of the seated section which meant I got a great view of everything. I was in the third row and I was so happy. This was the first time I was not on the sides so it was a different perspective. When we were taking our seats, Brave Girls was doing their prerec. After they finished, their fans left (only a few of them) and then it was Gugudan. Gugudan was amazing. And their fans! Before each take begins they count to three and then say Gugudan fighting! The girls I were by were as shocked as I was by this wonderful unison so we all mumbled Heol. Gugudan is so cute. In between Gugudan takes, those on the left side were able to see the kids and were waving and screaming at them. After they finished, their fans left and the N1 standings were brought in for our prerec time, including one of our few fanboys. He was standing right in the front. YOU GO FANBOY! YOU GO! 

Once again, they were doing Dunk Shot. On a scale from 1 to 10, it was a 100. The boys were so good and so adorable. Because of my seat I was able to see the adorableness that was Haechan. MY PRECIOUS SON! During one part of the song, they had to make this scrunchy face and it was just so adorable and I kid you not, we were all dying. It was just so cute and even during playback we were screaming. I dont know if our fandom is either proud moms or something else when it comes to Dream. 

The song was a shorter version than the one they sang at Inki but everything still flowed together nicely. In between takes, fan support was reminding us to wiggle our fingers during the song. Towards the last take, security told us that we had to leave right away and that we would be leaving from the side we were on. Mark was out to slay that day. He died. He started the slayage that Sunday for me and by Saturday it was official that Mark was my number 2 in NCT. Before the last take, Haechan was waiting on the side and then walked up but no one followed him. Usually Jeno is the culprit of that. This time Haechan. Mark was the last one up. We had to leave right away but they thanked us as usual. These angels. We all left the venue and that was that. Music show promotions, pretty much over.

It has been an exhausting few months for the fans. Since January we have been going every weekend with recordings, fan signs, events, you name it. But it has been amazing and incredible. I am so excited to have a break for a few more weeks before another unit begins promotions. SM hasnt said anything but we know its happening. Im just so proud of the Dreamies. They got a triple crown and had their first fan sign. They had four fan signs this weekend [March 25 and March 26] as well. Overall, it has been an incredible time with the boys [127] and the kids [Dream] and I miss them terribly. Im so excited to see their growth this year.

Also, when promotions started in January I had no idea how to even tie a balloon. Now I do. Thats progress. ",5,32,False,self,,,,,

This was an amazing concert, I'm really tired and I'm having some serious post-concert depression right now, but I'm about to vicariously retell and relive all the amazing glorious things that happened in the past three hours. Just a note, the setlist/performances are more or less the same as what u/ShawolSupport posted in their [fanaccount](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/60y1ki/shinee_world_v_fan_account_vancouver_my_first/) and to be honest reading their fan account, it's more or less the same as that. Most of what I could say about the performances was already said by u?ShawolSupport in their fanaccount, so instead I'll just give you an account/play by play of what happened and what I thought was so amazing that it's still stuck and burned in my memory even though I'm so sleepy. It's not all the songs or moments, but it's stuff I found most memorable and impactful.

Okay, first, the line setup was horrible. People were still in line to get into the Shrine when it was 7:30 pm, and people were worried that the concert was going to start without them. Obviously it didn't, but the whole line situation could've been managed much better--my friends and I got there around 6:15 and it wasn't until 7:30 that we actually got into the venue. My friend and I were incredibly lucky--we were in the fourth row, and although the map on the Shrine's website made it look like we wouldn't be that close, we actually really were! (*Just a note:* I'm going to describe things/write this and post pics later, I'm going to have to get them all off my phone first and upload them to Imgur and then edit this text post to link them all on here). The concert started with the Fairytale VCR, which was really weird but I really like surreal, sort of unrealistic stuff like it (there were scenes where they walked through doors and phased planes and were in space, it was really cool). Then they started off and, let me tell you, it wasn't until Juliet that I could really hear the music and recognize the songs because it was so incredibly loud. By the end of the concert, my eardrums were shot--everything still sounds really muffled and distorted to me but that's okay, anything for SHINee.

Why So Serious is the first song they performed that sticks out, it was so good! Their charisma was on fire. It's honestly not my favorite promotional track by them, but after this I love it 10,000 times more, IT IS SO MUCH BETTER LIVE! I'm Onew-biased, but seriously, he was in center for the chorus and just oozed performance value and charisma. I was thoroughly satisfied after being so lukewarm on the song for so long. 

Okay, most of this fan-account will be telling you about the member interactions with themselves and with the audience. THEY WERE SO CUTE. Of course Key started off with the introductions in English, and he was really good. Minho spoke English for the majority of the concert too! He was so good. Key got us pumped: ""I love, not for LA, we're not here for k-pop concert, I wanted to come here for SHINee world!"" and the crowd cheered like wild. After their introductions, they performed Prism, let me tell you, THAT WAS LIT! It went completely dark, and then you hear the instrumental slowly building up and suddenly WHAM! Explosion of color and they looked so fucking awesome. Jonghyun rocked it in all-plaid, he was so dapper-looking and that with the choreography was absolutely enthralling to watch. They were so sharp and professional, I couldn't believe it! Honestly I couldn't believe the entire concert and that it all happened. At one point during Prism, Minho started taking off his jacket and doing body rolls with his back turned to the audience--my eardrums were lost to all the screams when he did that. Key was absolutely sparkling in his outfit, I don't know how but for some reason the light really reflected off his and he looked really bright.

Also, sidenote, but they're [REALLY](https://imgur.com/a/al4Pn) handsome in real life. Also, they're much more defined--they tend to look softer in pictures but in real-life, both their dancing and their physical appearance is really sharp. Onew is definitely the bulkiest--I was surprised by how short he and Jonghyun were! Key seemed really tall compared to the rest of the members--that's probably both my perception and the fact that the concert was so hyped, but that's what it felt like to me.

Anyways, continuing on, they did Replay, and it started off rather simply with a stripped sort of instrumental before building to the usual instrumental they use. I would describe it as acapella, except it wasn't--it did sound like that though. Again, Onew-biased, but he was so charismatic. Honestly, they all were. Also, Taemin had a nice little dance solo during Replay, it was really good! The next song I remember them performing was Hello, they were just singing along and waving with the crowd. I got a really good video of Taemin later--I don't know how to post videos onto here, but if I figure out how I'll post that ""fancam"" later. Then it was Odd Eye, and honestly this was the song where the most people in my section were singing along, probably due to all the English lines. It was reallyy good. Side note, but WOW could the theater sing in Korean. SHINee definitely has some of the most dedicated fans I've seen, the whole theater was singing along to the songs in Korean for a lot of the songs! I was really impressed by how much love they got, it made me so happy. 

Then it was Feel Good--I think there was an outfit change before this because I distinctly remember that they were all in all-plaid. Not exactly the most sartorial of choices, but SHINee pulled it off very well--and to be honest Feel Good's choreography was so perfect that the all-plaid became an afterthought. I know this sub tends to dislike SM's raps, especially Minho, but let me tell you, HE'S SO CHARISMATIC performing his raps in person. The Feel Good rap was so good! It's made me enjoy his raps so much more, I actually looked forward to them on the songs they were going to perform after that. 

Okay, and now for honestly the highlight of my night, I've been waiting to see this live ever since I got into SHINee, SHERLOCK. IT WAS SO FUCKING GOOD. LIKE, I've seen so many stages of it, so many comeback videos, the 2X dance speed video, the dance performance version--all of that pales into comparison to the real deal. There is so much magnetism oozing from them that it's ridiculous. They were absolutely on fire. They were perfect! It was absolutely incredible to watch. The leg-sweeping move in the chorus's choreography is absolutely breathtaking. And once again, Minho's raps, you wouldn't think they're that good but boy did they get me so hyped for all of Sherlock! AND GOOD GOD, ""TONIGHT, SHINEE'S IN THE HOUSE! SO GIVE IT UP GIVE IT UP GIVE IT UP FOR SHINEE!"" is like the best way to end that song in an absolutely amazing concert.

Next was Ring Ding Dong, followed by Lucifer. So hard-hitting; I hadn't looked at the setlist beforehand so I wasn't expecting Ring Ding Dong right after Lucifer--IT'S SUCH AN EXPERIENCE. You're so hyped from Ring Ding Dong, and then suddenly right after it ends WHAM straight into the instrumental of Lucifer! Absolutely incredible. Also, Minho surprisingly had a little dance break in it--he was so good! I usually never pay attention to Minho's dancing, but good god it was great. And then just when you think it wouldn't get any better, FUCKING JONGHYUN HITS A HIGH NOTE AND SUSTAINS THAT HIGH NOTE FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS IN LUCIFER JUST BELTING OUT LIKE IT'S NOTHING. I was honestly speechless.

Now for the fun parts that you're probably looking to read, __the fan interactions__! They are so cute, I've never felt so endeared toward a group more in my life. While Key and Minho went backstage to change, Jonghyun Onew and Taemin talked to the fans through the translator. TAEMIN WAS ADORABLE. I can't believe I just wrote that, but it's true, he really was! He wanted to try saying stuff in English ""like how Key does it"" but he was too shy/nervous to, [SO HE PUTS THE HOODIE OF HIS JACKET UP TO COVER HIS FACE](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C75YLRaVYAA-JHE.jpg), STILL FEELS SHY, AND THEN TURNS AROUND NOT FACING THE AUDIENCE BEFORE SHOUTING ""ARE YOU GUYS HAVING FUN TONIGHT?"" I died. And even after he did that, he was still wearing the hoodie and still really shy, and covered his face in his hands. And then after that, Taemin: ""I learned so much English!"" How can anyone be so lovable, I don't understand? After that they went to change and Minho and Key talked. They were so fucking funny.

&gt; Minho: ""I watched NBA."" 

&gt; Key: ""He bought some kind of t-shirt for $300 bucks."" 

&gt; Minho: ""Shhh that's secret.""

&gt; Minho: ""Actually, my favorite basketball player is Kobe Bryant. But today, the Lakers don't have a game, so I watched LA Clippers. Clippers is...(*pause*) good. (Another pause) They lose."" 

&gt; Key: ""Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about, so anyways, what did you eat today."" (I laughed so hard).

&gt; Minho: ""I had hot dog and In-N-Out burger. SHINee like In-N-Out."" (I was wearing my In-N-Out t-shirt to the concert, you have no idea how excited I was when they said that). 

Then Key talked about LaLa Land and how much he liked watching it, and tried to sing parts of the song but he couldn't remember so he was like to Minho ""Talk something, talk something, I have to remember"" but then he remember five seconds later lol. And then Minho DABBED. And then Taemin tried talking in English, ""Those uh...members, we're five?"" and Key savaged ""Don't say we're five. This is SHINee FIVE."" 

After all that, they performed slow-tempo songs. The ones that stood out to the me the most were Selene, Jonghyun and Onew's duet, and Don't Let Me Go. Don't Let Me Go is (probably) my favorite SHINee song, so I got really emotional listening to them perform it. It sounds incredibly sweet and lyrical live.

Okay, and then just when you think they were done being hard-hitting, **VIEW COMES ON**. And not only that, [THEY'RE IN WHITE SUITS](https://imgur.com/a/Vzr4k). They looked astoundingly handsome. I don't understand. Everyone was singing along, and everyone (including me!) was doing the fanchants in the chorus. I'm so glad I learned the fanchant for that song before coming because seriously, it's even that much more of a better and incredible experience watching them sing View. It was absolutely magical. I thought the comeback stages looked good, but nothing will ever compare to seeing them in white suits--it's so fucking mature and...well, attractive. I thought during Ready or Not after that they might get dizzy from all the spinning, but I guess they were prepared because they did it so fucking well!

Then came the Woof Woof VCR. Yes, THAT one. I don't remember Onew and Jonghyun's names for it, but: [Flaming Charisma Minho. Dance Machine Taemin.](https://imgur.com/a/JVwsP) Master Key. 90's workout-themed VCR. That is all. 

After that, 1 of 1, and not just 1 of 1, [1 OF 1 IN THE FUCKING GODDAMN SUITS THEY WORE FOR THE MV](https://imgur.com/a/rTQnc). It was like watching the MV live, I was stupefied by how beautiful they looked in them. It's so good live. And the best part is that it was like the best thing, even better than the 1 of 1 MV, because Onew got to dance the choreography with them! And I don't know how he pulled it off, but Key in a baseball cap plus a suit was oddly aesthetically pleasing and really handsome on him. 

I don't remember anything after that, but I do remember these specific parts at the end: first, Key was like ""we're coming back soon, right?"" while looking at the other members. HINTING AT COMING BACK OR COMING TO AMERICA SOON AGAIN? Then Onew was like, ""I wish we could come back, I love being here!"" And then, in typical Onew fashion: ""The flight is only thirteen hours!"" I love how sarcastic he is. One thing I noticed is that he was in his own little world during the ending comments--while Key or someone was talking, he was singing/talking to himself and smiling to himself, I couldn't make out what he was singing but all I do know is that it was absolutely endearing. Taemin said, ""The reason I like LA so much is because the weather is always nice"" and I went ""HELL YEAH IT IS"" but secretly in my mind I said ""Okay except the last three months of torrential rain that were good for the drought but bad for everything else, other than that though YES TAEMIN!"" Jonghyun: ""Uh, you guys were doing this a lot today"" before proceeding to blow air-kisses at the audience, HE WAS SO PROUD OF HIMSELF and honestly he should've been, the crowd lost their mind. At the end they had us all take a group pic while holding up the 1 of 1 signs everyone got during the concert! It was so sweet. Key made a comment: ""Huh, maybe we should take more pics *outside*"" and everyone went nuts over that too. They didn't though. At least not to my knowledge--I didn't want to bother them so me and my friends left after they performed their final song and the final VCR. 

So yeah, that's my really long-ass fan account and I'm really sorry it's so long, but I really did want to include as much detail as possible, and I hope you had fun reading it! I'm sorry if this reads as a gushing/super colored account; I tend to try to be objective but it's SHINee, I absolutely love them (after tonight even moreso) so I tried being as honest as possible, even if that does run the risk of sounding very purple prose-y. If there was anyone else in LA who went, comment below and add more stuff! I probably missed a lot, there was just *so much* that happened and it was a really overwhelming experience (in absolutely the best way possible!) that everything was so great, I just forgot so much that's happened already (probably because I'm also super tired haha). I will try to add pics before I go to bed tonight, I just have to upload them! If you happen to figure out how I can post videos too (since I don't think Imgur supports them) that would be great too. Hope you had fun reading this fan-account, and I hope you love and support SHINee!",19,67,False,self,,,,,

It touches on plastic surgery, the abundance of child trainees along with other tidbits about kpop and it's place in Korean culture. They even mention the SK army playing kpop across the border ""as a form of psychological warfare"" and a segment on North Korea.

Has anyone else see it? I thought it was pretty interesting and quite humorous at times.

Thoughts?

[Soompi article](https://www.soompi.com/2017/03/28/exos-sehun-explains-awkward-time-mistook-seventeens-jeonghan-ncts-johnny/):

&gt; EXOs Sehun finally got to talk about the funny mistake that he made involving NCTs Johnny.

&gt; On March 28 on SBS Power FMs NCTs Night Night, Sehun and Suho appeared as guests with NCTs Jaehyun and Johnny as the DJs.

&gt; During the broadcast, a fan sent a message to the broadcast mentioning the incident during the 2017 Idol Star Athletic Championships last Lunar New Years, when Sehun mistook SEVENTEENs Jeonghan for NCTs Johnny.

&gt; Sehun admitted, *Yes, I did confuse them, but they looked exactly the same from the back!*

&gt; Johnny said, *I didnt know at the time. I only found out after a friend showed it to me.* He joked, *It does sting a bit.*

&gt; Sehun explained, *I cant remember what we were talking about, but the conversation paused for a second. I thought for sure it was [Johnny], and called out Youngho.'* The youngest EXO member recalled how both he and Jeonghan were startled and how he quickly apologized and left.",16,189,False,self,,,,,

Pretty much the entirety of kpop to me is a guilty pleasure lmao. No one around here listens to it and my family/significant other all judge me for it quite a bit (and it's completely different from my other musical tastes).

Aside from that, I so love watching girl groups do dance covers of guy groups and vice versa. I don't watch a lot of variety but any time there are guy/girl group interactions on Weekly Idol, I watch that shit.

Anyway, share your guilty pleasures (or not so guilty) here!",165,115,False,self,,,,,

Oh My Girl - Closer (fantastic song, fantastic singing, impressive video both regarding performance and esthetics. Very moving stuff. I could watch this on repeat for a while.)

2. Crayon Pop - Bar Bar Bar (the first video that really made me go *wow*. Crayon Pop is awesome. Colourful, fun, pretty, catchy. Kind of reminds me of White Stripes for some reason. My absolute favorite kpop group overall.)

3. Orange Caramel - Catallena (the song is super catchy with that weird little vocal hook, and the video is pure amazing. So hilarious and innovative. One of the great videos of all time anywhere.)

4. IU - A Lost Puppy (Much to my disappointment, couldn't find an official music video for this song. But the song itself makes up for it. Wonderful piece of pop music, really heartfelt and touching. And from what I gather from the translation, the lyrics seem strong as well. At least IU's sentiment comes through clearly, and it is really quite moving to behold.)

5. Girls' Generation - Lion Heart (I realize the importance of Gee, and it might be the better song, but I really dig how the band keeps itself relevant with this classy, understated, stylized piece of pop music. No cheap tricks or gimmicks, just doing what they excel at, brilliantly. So infectiously catchy, so simple, so easy, so brilliant. Beautiful.)

Other groups / artists I liked: f(X), AOA, Red Velvet, T-ara, Ga In.

Disclosure 1: I don't understand a single word of Korean.

Disclosure 2: I usually listen to hip hop nowadays (Vince Staples, Young Thug, Kanye West...), after a lifetime of listening to rock music of all kinds and finally getting kind of bored with it. This kpop thing just crossed my mind out of nowhere and I decided to give it a try. With these very rewarding results.

Bonus apop recommendation: The only current apop hit that I'd consider putting in the same Spotify list with the above five is Katy Perry's Chained to the Rhythm, which I personally consider a brilliant song with a fantastic music video. And it would fit right in aesthetically. :P

Does this make any sense? :D

Artist and Company|Designation|Genre/Concept|Description
:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
[Cosmic Girls, Starship Entertainment] (http://imgur.com/uXWJ1n6) |Girl Group|Cosmic Girls, Dance Pop| Cosmic Girls debuted with a whopping 12 members, and added Yoo Yeunjung following her PD101/IOI success. WJSN stands for the names of the four sub-units: Wonder, Joy, Sweet and Natural and also for Wu Ju So Nyeo (the initials from the Romanization of ). They had quite the solid debut mini-album, featuring [MoMoMo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRJqH0Plqg8) and [Catch Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtLwAAhhXBo), but it wasnt until their first comeback, [Secret] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJxJ7tSi1w), that I decided to take an active interest in them. I tell you, that song changed my life. When Im in a supermarket and my music is on shuffle and Secret comes on, *I can feel the cosmo inside of me*. I was introduced to the group because I followed Exy after she was unjustly booted on UPRS Volume 2. In 2017, they released the EP From. WJSN, which featured the title track [I Wish] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7gOqqbBW6w).
[Awesome Day] (http://imgur.com/J32PwVD)|Female Duo|Indie, Ballad|Indie duo Awesome Day debuted with [Go Away] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjOKbuzrIVM), a song that I wish existed a few years ago because there are a few people who Id like to sing this song too. In May, they returned with mini-album For, which featured the songs [Breath] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBFP1UO1GO4) and [Maybe We Are] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xxb9hIHq_Y).
[Unfair, Rich World] (http://imgur.com/kybg7SG)|Male Soloist|R&amp;B|Before I get into his music, I want to say that I like Unfair and I like his voice. He lacks exposure (as do many good artists) but with some good creative direction he could probably pull off a funky, soulful song. He debuted with [Falling] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwJqn95l8_U) which had poor mixing in some parts even though the chorus was alright. His first release to have a music video was [You] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbHPvCFCptw), where **hes wearing a crisp white button-down** and lays on rocks, wet leaves, straw, a wooden plank, a piano, the middle of a street and (heres the winner) the ocean. Where the tides coming in. For art. I dont understand, this stuff just doesnt happen in the hood. Anyways in February he released [So Sweet] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUBBkxIUlaE) which had a video that didnt send him to the laundromat, bleach in hand.
[Mocha, TY Music] (http://imgur.com/ioxrgq2)|Male Soloist|Ballad|I would describe Mocha as being a ballad singer with a pinch of rock and indie mixed in. His first single was Bitter Parting, and it has two versions, one where the [lead actress is shaving] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6mmiipKyBE), and a [remix] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxwTtL5t-r8) version featuring Long:D. In May he released the single [To You] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItKtnanJxdE), and even sang an OST, [Exhausted] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoAbUb0odL4), for the drama Unusual Family. Most recently (like a week ago) he released the single [Will Be Okay] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3AwT6xsnfE).
[2U, Human Entertainment] (http://imgur.com/YMzZxkh)|Female Duo|Indie|Ive been following 2U since I first heard [Gone] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLyKAC4e5aY) but theyve only released two songs so far, the second one being [How About Your Heart] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbB_wZpFEMY). It is incredibly difficult to find any information about the two and the company website is under construction. Fun fact: 2U stands for Unique Unison. [Heres] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-awLu_cnA) an earlier clip of the two performing,
[CocoSori, Mole Entertainment]  (http://imgur.com/FIxe3dz)|Female Duo|Wacky, Twin Cosplay|I love, love, LOVE CocoSori! They debuted last year with broccoli-laden music video, [Dark Circle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4SGYjRPx1g). They garnered attention for having a similar concept to Orange Caramel. Their second single, [Exquisite] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHttanRj6VU), gathered the duo even more fans and features a giant cat screaming Annyoung! They released their first Japanese single, Mermaid in August. Coco is Korean-American (her full name is Coco Chanel Lee) and is a former member of girl group Blady. Sori has lived in Japan and is currently participating in Idolmaster Korea. 
[Sunkyum, Sort Music] (http://imgur.com/xPoiA7W)|Female Soloist|Soft rock, Indie|I told myself to listen to SunKyum a long time ago but I never did, even when she was constantly in my Youtube recommendations. She has quite a bit of songs out so Ill feature one for this post: [Reconciliation Song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyvDJSWpmQE)  it even has English subs! I mostly recommend this one because I like the storyline in the music video and the song talks about the pain that lack of communication can bring while in a relationship. For anyone who wants to hear more [here] (https://www.youtube.com/user/sortSUN0707) is her Youtube channel.
[Eia, Ego Entertainment] (http://imgur.com/hMgv0x2)|Female Soloist|R&amp;B|Eia debuted with [Spoon Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2qtpB0ISp0) and is on my personal list of most underrated soloists to debut in 2016. Her voice is a perfect balance between soft and strong. Hopefully, she will be able to break into the K-R&amp;B music scene with future releases. Later in 2016, she made her return with [Im Not a Fool] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyCn_UdSSC8).
[GEMMA, CJ E&amp;M] (http://imgur.com/sQRqM0w)|Female Soloist|Cute-ish Pop|I think GEMMA aka Gui Gui aka Emma Wu is most well known from We Got Married Global where she was paired with 2PMs Taecyeon (I cant help but think of Tachyon when I see/hear his name). [Sugar Rush] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmpztGdhKqc) marked the launch of her Korean Pop career as shes already a big star in Taiwan (I think, please correct me if Im wrong). I know that she trained in Korea for three months before her debut but her voice is somewhat weak; she needs to project it a bit more. The dancing wasnt bad but I wish there was more to it. [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydH1ZBMPe5I) is the Chinese version of Sugar Rush.
