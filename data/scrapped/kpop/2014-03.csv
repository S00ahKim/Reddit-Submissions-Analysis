What i'm mainly talking about are the Block B concerts. They are all east coast concerts and the West coast kpop fans are complaining about it. In actuality, the West coast gets about 90-95% of all of the bands that come to america. Even then East coast fans and Central fans pay out the butt to go to the West coast concerts. So why cant they do the same for the East coast concerts and not complain? 

This is a discussion, sorta. If it violates the subreddit rules, i'm sorry, i dont know where else this discussion/issue would go, other than r/kpop.",22,14

I was visiting Korea town the other day with a couple of friends and came across a well known K-Pop store. 
The man at the counter asked me if I was seeing Teen Top when they came down for their tour.
I shrugged it off because I didnt believe it was actually going to happen. 


I decided to check it out when I got home just in case, and I found out that they actually are coming to Toronto!

Teen Top is coming to Toronto on April 3rd!
Im not a crazy Teen Top angel but I do listen to a few of their songs and I am totally going!
An actual Kpop group is coming to TORONTO. This is awesome!


Heres the catch though.

""To make this concert happen, a minimum goal of $150,000 has to be reached by February 28th at 11:59PM (Eastern Standard Time). If this campaign is successful, the concert will take place at the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto on April 3rd, 2014 at 7:00pm! 

We only have two and a half days left.. but were about 3/4 funded already!
Almost 400 Angels and Kpop fans are coming to this concert. 

Sadly, a minimum of 150,000 must be funded and we're only about 115,000 raised.
Please spread the news so that everyone in and around Toronto will hear about this amazing event. That an actual Kpop group is coming to Canada, and TORONTO at that!

Regarding this connection to Girls' Generation, a rep of MR.MR told Asia Economy on March 3, ""The portion of netizens pointing out that MR.MR's 'Mr.Mr' was dissing Girls' Generation, who made a comeback with a song of the same name, is correct.""

MR.MR is the first idol group to release a dis song like this and also to acknowledge that it is indeed a dis song.  'Mr.Mr' was released on February 28 and included lyrics like, ""How could you do that when I'm right here? / Girl, you come out so easily from behind the curtain / Not me, but another mistake, Mr.Mr / I bet you're amused by my embarrassment,"" and, ""I become faint for a main like you / Am I loser and are you a winner? / We're going the same path / I must have looked small from your high perch / Is that why you did that to me?""

MR.MR's rep said, ""Isn't it a violation of ethics in the music industry to openly use an existing group's name for content in a song?  We deliberately put in that topic and the lyric's 'disses.'""

In a thread i posted recently ( http://tinyurl.com/lamzsn2 ), i gave a back story explaining that I don't get the chance to meet many kpop fans in my area. However, due to this age of information and use of internet is growing rapidly, more and more people begin to hear of the words K-pop before (maybe because of gangnam stylet wo years ago) but never actually explored it farther than that. I usually get very happy when people do ask me this question when they overhear my music (due to massive sound leakage coming from my headpohones). Personally, I have to pull out the Gee MV for most boys and girls. For girls recently, I showed them Beep Beep by BTOB, Spellbound, and/or Growl one take ver.by EXO. If that isn't enough, theres always more in my arsenal of K-Pop archives like SORRY SORRY(classic song). If they are interested and willing to explore, I expose them to this glorious subreddit and maybe a few pictures for the added awesomeness.

It's the moment you've all been waiting for... the results of the 2014 census are now out!

Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewanalytics?formkey=dGJ0VmN2Y3MzZkwwRXlBZmtNS1N0QWc6MQ (takes a few seconds to load)

Unfortunately I accidentally deleted the previous census' data when creating this census, but for those curious, in late 2012 our gender ratio was ~75% male and ~25% female, so we've become a lot more gender balanced! Additionally, if I remember correctly we didn't have as nearly a diverse population, ethnicity-wise, back in 2012 (AKA we now have a greater proportion of Asian people compared to white people).

In 2012 we also had around ~1300 responses and we had ~1800 responses this round.

Here is a graph of /r/kpop's favorite groups since the graph for that question cannot be displayed on the results page:

In response to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1zd785/kpop_glossary_proposal/), we've begun to work on a K-Pop glossary in the wiki, it's still in a very early stage of development, considering that the first edit was literally made today, but that's where you guys come in.

There's a lot of words that we could define, and it would take a while for us to think of all of them, so we'd really enjoy it if you'd take a second or two to comment the words that you think should be in our glossary. We're looking for words that apply mostly to the examples in the link above ([or right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1zd785/kpop_glossary_proposal/)).

Thanks!

I sometimes think about these things because clearly I have no life. Ah hah!

Anyway, I've always thought it would be so awesome to see Nine Muses perform an SNSD song and vice versa. I don't know, it makes sense right? The member count matches up and I think it'd be fun to see them out of their own musical styles. 

I've also always wanted to see a Jay Park and Ailee collaboration because they are both hot and talented. 

What are you 'dream' performances?",48,12

For instance, when [Kyung's Teaser](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0k0fW1JivU) for Nilili Mambo era came out, I must have watched it at least 50 times that night.  To this day, every time I stumble across it, I gotta replay it at least 20 times.  Also, this performance of [AOA Black's Moya](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cbxkfnaLdA) just makes me so happy; I've watched it so many times.  Choa is one of my ultimate biases and her smile in this performance feels so warm that it just gives me the tummy fluffies!!!

It seems like in between every public appearance, members are dying/bleaching their hair and adding other chemicals and hairsprays. As someone who can't dye or bleach their hair once without it frying and looking unhealthy, does anyone have any theories on how Kpop stars do it? It seems like they're literally dying/bleaching their hair on a weekly, even daily basis. 


If you don't believe me, look up a performance of a group you like and then look up one from a week later. I bet you anything at least one member will have an entirely new hair color. ",48,106

If I'm not mistaken, Soyu and Junggigo's ""Some"" is still #1 on the charts, right? Isn't this a big deal?

Obviously a lot of fans would support it like they do with girl groups (even if they say it's trashy) so doesn't that mean more money?

Dynamic Duo, the hip-hop duo that consists of Choiza and Gaeko, is one of the most well-known, prolific groups to ever come out of Korea. Originally members of the seminal underground hip-hop crew CB Mass, the two formed Dynamic Duo and released their debut album Taxi Driver in 2004 to much fanfare. It quickly became a best-selling album in Korea, cementing their status as hip-hop icons. They have released seven full-length albums in the past nine years, garnering a string of top 40 hits and winning the Best Hip-Hop Album award at the Korean Music Awards in 2006. That same year, they founded Amoeba Culture, a record label focused on new and innovative artists, sounds, and design. More information at www.amoebaculture.com.

But with over 20k of you guys, I'm sure you've stumbled across something fantastic that seems to get no recognition from this subreddit, or even in general.


[Park Jiyoon's ""Tree of Life""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw077fxesZs) is absolutely gorgeous and I really wish she'd go back to this style because I'm not a big fan of TWATWATWATWATWAT


[San E](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7ZWkXvdPU) never gets any love around here which makes me sad because he's adorable and hilarious and a genius.


[This is the best thing BIGSTAR ever did](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOx6lyZ7BdI) and the song never fails to make me happy, but it came and went and like...no one talked about it???  But it's awesome???


[This song is legendary in Korea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXV7dfvSefo) but I feel like a lot of people first coming to this subreddit may just be getting into k-pop and only know of big idol groups.  This song is incredible, and spring is just around the corner, so hopefully you can add this gem to your spring playlist!!!


What about you, /r/kpop?  What are great songs that no one seems to talk about here that you're just dying to share?",31,13

Most of the time it's news, live concerts, and popular MVs and although that's great, we might be missing some jewels along the way.


 Just as the title says, share songs that you enjoy that other people might not know about. For example, I think Tabian has a great mini album, Honey Fingers 6 has a fun rhythm, Namolla Family N is amazing, etc. I'll post some of my own songs when I get back, but the point is to discover a new genre and further our kpop adventure.

edit: Sorry didn't see that other link about less popular Mvs, but this thread can pertain about songs without MVs and such.",40,18

That first number in part 3 is almost IU-like. There's a pretty neat live band version of ToD in there, too.",4,13

When we were Krowdpopped for Teen Top to come to Toronto, we made it SO close to collecting enough money to bring them to here. So close that Krowdpop took the time to find a sponsor willing to pay the remainder! 

It worked and Toronto is offically Krowdpopped and Teen Top is coming to Toronto on March 30th at 7pm!

Here is the video showing how hard we worked, and proof that Teen Top is coming to Toronto!

Here are the three different tickets that you can purchase !

-
Super Angel VIP  $250
Fans with Super Angel VIP tickets will be up-close with Teen Top at the concert as they stand in the front section of the venue. They will attend an exclusive fan signing with Teen Top and attend a hi-touch event with Teen Top. There is a limited amount of Super Angel VIP tickets so be sure to get yours now before they run out!
-
Angel VIP  $150
Angel VIP ticket holders will be standing in the middle section of the venue and will attend the exclusive hi-touch event with Teen Top. If you previously bought a GA Orchestra ticket during the Krowdpop campaign, you can only attend the hi-touch event if you upgrade your ticket by paying $70 more.
-

GA Floor ticket holders will be seated in the back section of the venue. There are no fan-interaction benefits  with this ticket, but you get to enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime concert at an affordable price.

They are looking to debut a new idol group - how can they be successful in the 2014 idol market, and break through to become a popular act and survive for many years? What type of songs, concepts, promotions will they need? What would the members have to be, do, look like? Is there any hope for a rookie group these days? 

With every debut we see standards falling and many new groups fading into obscurity almost immediately - what does /r/kpop think can be a successful 2014 debut? ",44,38

417,2014-3-14,2014,3,14,11,20dg3j,Korea Muslim Federation speaks out against CL's 'MTBD' + YGE reported to remove the controversial portion,woonawoona,1394765284,"CL and her solo track ""MTBD"" (""Mental Breakdown"") from 2NE1's 2nd full-length album 'CRUSH' has become a controversial topic, with many Muslim listeners pointing out that one portion of the background music seems to be a reading of a verse from the Quran.

SEE ALSO: 2NE1 release dance practice video for 'Come Back Home'

As the Quran is the central text of Islam, Muslims protested that it is extremely offensive and it should not be made light of by being put in a song or used for entertainment purposes of any form.
 
The Korea Muslim Federation has now raised a formal complaint, speaking out on the 12th, ""Muslims find this song to be a severe insult and are demanding for the agency to take action including quickly removing it or editing the entire song, and apologizing to Muslims... In the case that they don't comply to the demand, we will take action with the Muslims around the world who find this to be a serious matter.""

There has not been any official word from the agency, but according to a report by Chosun, YG Entertainment is said to have decided to remove the controversial portion from the song.

On the March 17 episode of 'Healing Camp', Yuri said, ""Recently, I feel troubled. I don't know what to do now. I'm having fun in Girls' Generation, but it's not something I started at first as a big dream. The members were just friends who I liked dancing and singing with. But now that I'm a singer, I think about what I really wanted.""

""I feel like I have nowhere to go. I don't think we have much more time as idols. I worry about how all of the Girls' Generation girls can stay happy together with lasting beautiful memories.""

Since we have around 800 questions, please don't send in generic questions like ""What is the color of Super Junior's glowstick?""

Anyways, be creative with this! Keep in mind that it's multiple choice with 3 wrong answers, and 1 correct one.

We need around ~300 more questions to make this topic a thing! Please help us out, and thank you for your time!

EDIT: If you're submitting a few questions, be sure to mark the right and wrong answers~ Thank you again!

If you want, have a more in depth question about a certain member in a band, a fact about them!

They don't even have to be idols! The category of K-Pop will cover all Korean music!",77,50
527,2014-3-18,2014,3,18,6,20nth2,iTunes retroactively changing 2NE1's MTBD,jihyo_running,1395090567,"2 days ago when I last listened to MTBD on my iPhone I was listening to the version with the verse from the Koran; however when I listened to MTBD today on my phone I noticed it was the edited version. The file on my computer is still the original version. Has anyone else noticed this? Why are they retroactively changing songs instead of just releasing a statement? 


Edit: Just read terms of service apparently when you purchase music you are only purchase a license to listen to the music, and they can edit the content as they see fit. I just found this interesting because I haven't explicitly synced my iPhone since I bought the song, which means my phone is constantly syncing to iTunes",29,23

But I feel like that was just a small part of the music scene at the time, wasn't it? Like that's literally 2 boy groups. There weren't many more than that, right? It's nowhere near the magnitude of the Korean idol scene. People say oh the US used to have idols and then they moved towards soloists so that's probably what Korea will do. But personally I think that's not valid evidence for that argument even if the point that Korea is moving away from idol groups is true. What do you think?",6,0

626,2014-3-21,2014,3,21,3,20xcwz,Sports Chosun Surveys Industry Experts About Girls' Generation &amp; 2NE1's Comeback,hwangminah,1395341479,"**[Settling SNSD vs 2NE1's Comeback] 10 Industry Experts Surveyed: ""SNSD's Victory""**

Sports Chosun interviewed a group of 10 industry experts on February 28th and again on March 18th. I'll be summarizing the entire article as well as the responses. Some of the responses are not written verbatim.

**Survey results:**

-7/10 experts thought ""Comeback Home"" was the better track

-3/10 believed SNSD's song was more successful while 1/10 believed 2NE1's comeback was; 4/10 proclaimed a draw

[Some experts changed their view as the promotions continued: in the first survey conducted on Feb 28th, 7/10 experts believed 2NE1's song would be more successful, but as SNSD's activities continued to pick up some reverted their predictions and declared a 'draw']

-According Director L: ""Compared to when the song first released, SNSD's Mister Mister is receiving more and more favorable responses as time goes on. The song is bringing in more public attention especially since it won #1 on award shows.""

-Director R clarified, ""A title track winning #1 causes a lot of activity. Mister Mister is the type of song you don't understand upon first listen, but as it keeps playing it gets good.""

-When asked which song is catchier, 6/10 experts said Mister Mister, although opinions could have changed since the release of the songs.

[Ranking Chart of SNSD &amp; 2NE1](http://imgur.com/O6VMaTr.jpg)

The experts ranked SNSD and 2NE1's comeback in 5 categories: ""Music Video,"" ""Catchiness of the Song,"" ""Wardrobe,"" ""Choreography,"" ""Public Response""

Music Video [SNSD: 5.3 points, 2NE1: 5.5 points]

Catchiness of the Song: [SNSD: 5.6 points, 2NE1: 5.3 points]

Wardrobe: [SNSD: 4.9 points; 2NE1: 5.2 points]

Choreography: [SNSD: 5.6 points, 2NE1: 5.0 points]

Public Response: [SNSD: 5.3 points; 2NE1: 5.0 points]

Total: [SNSD: 26.7 points, 2NE1: 26 points]

According to Representative C: ""SNSD seems alive because of their performances. Especially during the performances on cable broadcast where the public's eyes and ears are both captivated.""

Meanwhile Director N stated, ""SNSD's choreography is well received in the public. On the other hand, while 2NE1's song is fine it is easy to see how their choreographies are lacking development.""

However, industry experts don't believe 2NE1 significantly 'lost' to SNSD. In fact, they believe this comeback has a lot of potential for the group that most clearly rivals SM's group.

Representative K said, ""It seems like in this match 2NE1's [fandom] size will increase. The public didn't expect anything less than an all-kill from them."" Furthermore, Director N clarified ""2NE1 is a group whose popular for the loyalty of its mania fans, it's certainly likely that 2NE1's fandom will get bigger because of this album.""

Some industry insiders believe SNSD's victory is also a victory for SM Entertainment and that the group will continue to prosper, while 2NE1 risks their position because of the lack of appearances on broadcast networks.

I don't think SNSD deserved such high marks for their MV points and the ""experts"" seem to focus on TV appearances a lot. Btw doesn't 2NE1 do better in the public appreciation aspect?",6,2

This song has been out for a while now, but I wanted to point out what I've noticed as well as pose a question to you guys.

The song in question is Karmin's [""I Want It All""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3SbIJI8sqk).

There's so many parallels here with K-Pop, it's a video/song that almost had to be influenced heavily by the genre in it's conception. With it's repeating vocal background track as well as the heavy use of a synth horn section, it's incredibly similar in style to groups like the Wonder Girls ([Girls Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrF-Ow1vG2E)) or even something like KARA's [Pandora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0XpNvLWimo). Do you agree or disagree? Find a K-Pop artist/song even closer in style?
___

My question to you is this: What Western pop songs have you found to have a similar sound or style to that of a K-Pop song?",9,3

But this is only from youtube comments and tumblr posts. The only source I have from TOP is from [this interview excerpt](http://www.hancinema.net/interview-big-bang-t-o-p--pt-2-26940.html) and all he says is

&gt;T.O.P (Choi Seung-hyeon): ""Oh mom"" is based on an actual episode. I can't exactly detail on that but basically it's my letter to one friend who is very, very sick. It's a very meaningful piece for me which wasn't planned in the track list but got included because I wanted it to be there badly. 

Can anyone confirm the dying fan story or point me to an actual source? I'm very curious.

Edit:

Just went through this video thinking it might be it:
http://vimeo.com/18863246 (at 2:37)
 
But again, no confirmation. 

Edit 2: Thanks to /u/g-dragon, I was able to piece it together a bit. Though I could not find the actual interview, one of the sites I found called Seungri out on revealing too much information about what TOP had tried to keep private. The fan sent TOP a sad letter about being (possibly terminally) ill with a brain tumor and so he wrote a song about it. Nothing about death or guilt. Thanks for finally quelling this rumor, everyone. It was nagging at me for a while.

Edit 3: To find the links I found, I searched ""Seungri yozm oh mom"" and similar words between Feb 1 2011 and Feb 19 2011 for anyone else who wanted sources.",11,6

/u/Khandielas and I have been working a bit on the [glossary](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/glossary) that was proposed about a month or so ago. We've defined about half of the words with the help of www.kpoppy.com and the obviously reliable help of www.urbandictionary.com, but we're left with a few terms that we aren't very sure about.

Therefore, we'd like some of your help to suggest or contribute some definitions for the words that we've left blank!

We're also a bit unsure on the formatting of the glossary, so any ideas to fix that up would be great too!

Thanks, /u/truthnotdare.

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback, guys, we really appreciate it and the new defs. will probably be in by tomorrow!",30,10

A rep from SM Entertainment stated that on March 27, she was sent to the hospital to receive emergency treatment after complaining of abdominal pain. The rep said, ""It's true that she went to the emergency room. They suspected it was her appendix, but after examination, that was ruled out.""

Sulli recently wrapped up filming for the film 'Pirates' and is in the midst of filming for the movie 'Fashion King', and it seems she's had a hard schedule. The rep continued, ""It was stress-related pain. After returning from the emergency room, she is resting.""

Hopefully, Sulli will feel better soon.

866,2014-3-30,2014,3,30,1,21ohe0,How would you design your own K-Pop group?,InverseTwinkie,1396111308,"You can take any existing individuals from the K-Pop world and design your own group, male, female, even male and female. What would they be called, what would their style be, who would be in it, why, etc. Ignore any age differences.

I'll start off.

* Suho (Exo-K) - leader/spokesperson [very good voice, great singer, very attractive, I'd force him to learn English and Japanese and actually promote the group]
* Junsu (TVXQ/JYJ) - lead singer 1 [best singer in my opinion, great dancer]
* Jonghyun (SHINee) - lead singer 2 [great voice, amazing singer, great dancer as well]
* Yongguk (BAP) - rapper [my favorite rapper, voice isn't irritating but soft and deep]
* Lay (Exo-M) - lead dancer [great dancer, great face, piano player of the group, speaks Chinese]

Their music style would essentially be a mix of SHINee and lighter BAP stuff. Think Rain Sound and Hurricane (BAP); Replay, Amigo, Obsession, Sherlock and Love Still Goes On (SHINee); You're (JYJ); Let Out The Beast (EXO); and Monster (Big Bang). They would also be heavily dance/choreography oriented (like these songs I mentioned would need new dances).

There would absolutely no ""yeah"" or ""uhh"" or ""this is ___"" in the songs in the intros or at all. English polished and actually makes sense, or none at all.

Ballads would feature Suho, Junsu, and Jonghyun, while heavier electric dance tracks would feature Yongguk and Lay.",42,14

p.s. don't hurt me, but i tweet a lot about k-pop and am trying to get more of a community going there so i can write articles for bigger places, get better access to artists, etc...so if you have one and are interested in following, check me out [@soyrev](http://twitter.com/soyrev) :) thanks again!",19,24

Apparently most of the problems were because of the fans.

These are some of the twitter from the concert visitors in San Jose:

Some fans sneaked in to their hotel and waited for them in their hallways

*A fan called Changjo a bitch because he wouldn't hug her

*Niel got dropped

*Unconsented touching at the hi touch such as hugging

*Chunji being shoved and called names

*Fans waiting after the concert to follow them and ask for autographs

*Fans pushing and name calling Mnet staff

*Teen Top expressed they were too afraid to leave their hotel room because of fans crowding the lobby

Anyways... Im now going to be writing a show thats just for youtube with the backing of CJ E&amp;M (Korea's Mnet) and I'd really love to hear your opinions on what you would like to see. 
Whereas Jjang was created for TV, there were certain criteria we had to follow and certain rules we weren't allowed to break but now that it's just for youtube, I have carte blanche. So I'm asking you, what do you like in a YT video/ what would you like to see. kpop links/contacts + being in korea + general tomfoolery + your ideas could equal something real cool i feel.  
Any critique, input or words will truly be appreciated! Hoping we can shape this up to be some cheeky entertainment.             

Hope your having a great weekend, cheers for your time x
