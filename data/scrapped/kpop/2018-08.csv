Also, what was it like witnessing its shift in sound and overall popularity?

Won't be disclosing it cause it might get people in trouble. But anyway, after they left, GD's staff left an unlabeled spray bottle of perfume because the sprayer was broken, so the production team split it among themselves, and they gave it to friends and family. Long story short, I got like 5mL.

So now, I'm trying to figure out what brand is it. I've read that back in 2016-ish he used Frederic Malle Musc Ravageur, so I looked it up, but it didn't look the same.

It's to the point where I refrain from annoucing that I listen to kpop, because it usually goes one of two ways:

1. The person doesn't listen to kpop and now I'm grouped in with what they view as the annoying fanboys/girls

2. They do listen to kpop and ask me who I stan, who my bias is, if I ship certain people together, etc.

The thing is, beyond the names of the songs and the artists, I really don't know much else. I just find the songs that I like and listen to them, and I don't really take the time to do a bunch of research about the idols themselves. In fact, for some of the larger groups I could probably only name 1 or 2 people. Maybe my experience is different because I am actually fluent in korean as a Korean-american. Having lived in korea I can say that most of the fans there aren't as obsessed as some of the foreign fans back home.

Like where I live at barely if any even knows about this genre I guess and if they do know its because of BTS (nothing beyond just the name)... its discerning for me cause I like the music honestly. I know for a fact if I tell any of my friends they will give me a weird look or put me in a category as to where im an outcast or something. I shouldnt worry what other people think but at the same time I would like to talk to someone who somewhat as the same interests as me. I like all types of kpop too doesnt have to necessarily be soft but upbeat and hype music too. Anyone could recommend me something that I could perhaps show my friends to get an opinion out of them. I know everyone wont like a certain type of music but I want them (my friends) to at least try to listen to it before saying ""oh its different language im not interested"" which is bs cause my multicultural friends like spanish  music and heck even I do but I dont understand a lick of it.

However, I changed my mind after I saw the thread on the availability of SNSD's early discography on Spotify. So, just as the title of this thread suggests, I think it's time for people to give YouTube Music a try.  It's a pretty good alternative to Spotify for K-Pop music for the following reasons: 

***Their K-Pop library is comparable to Spotify***  
Their K-Pop library used to be pretty bad and messy when it first launched in 2015.  Lots of songs were missing, albums were disorganized, and artists with similar names were mixed together.  Some of these issues are still present here and there, but they aren't as bad as it used to be.  Their library has gotten much, much better these days.  

*Here are the available Girls' Generation songs and albums on their service for example:*
 https://music.youtube.com/browse/UCd9xXioUdCTc8vtEORPMLaQ

I believe that's their whole discography. 

***If you can't find the songs you want on Spotify, then YouTube Music will likely have it***
Can't find all the songs from miss A and Wonder Girls on Spotify?  No problem.

*miss A:*  https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCh3JvEbg-3dwJ0Ou2gXj0vQ

*Wonder Girls:*  https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCNiudyD8Hwh7utzPWgxe_yg

Can't find an official upload made by YouTube?  No problem.  

YouTube Music can grab unofficial song uploads from their main video streaming platform and play them on there for you.  

***You can support your favorite group's Official YouTube uploads, while listening to their albums***

YouTube Music likes to swap out audio tracks with their respective Official Music Videos or Official Live Performances in album playlists.  I'm sure hardcore fans would appreciate this as it would help contribute to their favorite artist's YouTube view count, **and most importantly, they are done all in one place.** 

And for those who don't care about all that, don't worry.  Simply create your own album playlist through their song list if you don't want to listen to those versions.

Now, YouTube Music is by no means perfect.  They still lack features that are available on Spotify.  However, I still found YouTube Music to be more convenient to use as it is part of the whole YouTube network and I go on YouTube very frequently.  With YouTube Music, there's no need for me to get on a whole different site and make a new account to listen to the music I want.  Buying albums digitally and physically is still my preferred option for music listening, but it's always good to have a 2nd option to fall back on when I'm on a tight budget.  Oh, and just so you know, Google Play Music will soon be replaced by this service. 

Anyways, here's a link to YouTube Music:  https://music.youtube.com/

I'm pretty new to KPop, I always had 5 or 10 KPop songs on my phone that I used to listen to, but recently I started to watch videos and content from the groups I like and get more interested.

Today [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJdp3gH_HFQ) left me intrigued and a bit shocked. Harley Morenstein (the one in the video) was basically saying how he got a ton of backlash for saying he liked KPop and that a lot of this backlash was racism. What surprised me the most was that he got all this shit for saying ""he liked"" KPop, he was not even attacking anyone.

My questions are: 

Was this coming from Koreans? (In a way that they don't like non koreans to be fans of KPop... I doubt it tbh but is the only thing I can think off)

If the backlash was not from koreans.. Why did people do this??

For context, I have been quite critical of YG in the past, and I've also, like some fans of CL and indeed, other female artists and groups within YG, have taken to calling the company misogynist. Since the release of Seungri's album, it's become a bit more obvious, and I've also called out (as has one other) the fact that there's a very clear gap between female artists and what they are able to release, and what male employees are able to release within a YG context. Of course, VIP's got very, incredibly, diaper-filling mad at me. 

 

This is what I have written to those factions, and indeed, to the greater Korean pop community at large. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

You know, still seeing the absolute shitfits VIP's are having for the past few days or so, because I had the gall to point out a simple fact about misogyny and patriarchy in YG, really just highlights something for me: that it seems to be that, for the most part, Korean pop fans are willing (albeit kicking and screaming) to have a conversation about racism in the genre. Yet, when that same conversation about patriarchal and misogynistic systems is had...bitter hostility. Deflection. 
 
Once again, I will reiterate: all men, in YG, and in other entertainment companies, benefit from misogyny, and patriarchy. Yes, even your precious Seungri. There is absolutely no way, in a just world, that CL could go through what she has, and not get an album. Yet Seungri can waltz right in, for all intensive purposes, and get an album with relatively little fuss. No, I don't give a shit about what he had to go through in the beginnings of BIG BANG (like it matters at this point nearly being a decade plus old lol) or the supposed abuse that he went through recently. He was able to get an album in less time, and with less hassle, then CL has. CL has written nearly 300+ songs. Has tried to hook up with American producers, has tried her damnedest to get her name out there. Yet YG won't even return her calls and texts, has cancelled interviews with American media outlets, and pulled the rug out from under both her and the group she lead for shady reasons. Should I also mention that she needed to hire *HER OWN* stylists and makeup artists to perform in the Olympic Closing Ceremonies? AKA one the biggest stage anyone will ever have? If this was any sort of normal company, YG would have comped and helped her in a drop of a hat. But they didn't.
 
Why?
 
Misogyny. We don't know why YG is acting like this - although we can make educated guesses - but it is indeed happening, and punctuates a long, brutal saga of YG treating female artists like shit, that really came to a head with 2NE1. The fact that when she left, Minzy's dad was willing to bust through the bullshit YG was spewing, and that YG was scared enough to back down, should tell you something about how he truly is. Bom's entire saga is reason enough to prove that YG simply doesn't care about women. Now contrast that with iKON, WINNER, and BIG BANG. BIG BANG can shit out an album, and YG will trip over himself to put it out as fast as humanely possible. iKON is mostly the same way. WINNER, had the same problems that CL has, yet when CL fans tried to tell them, hey, guess what! WINNER fans decided to call CL fans the house wreckers, the ones who wanted to break the notion of 'YG Family' when that hasn't been true in fucking years. If it was at any point.
 
But back to the original point: it really shows that in the power dichotomy of girl groups and their fans, and boy groups and their fans, boy group fans (the majority of which are female) are utterly scared of girl groups, and the fact that they can challenge their oppas. As a result, as we saw with the Blinks vs. Armys spat from earlier in the summer, boy group fans will more often then not, slag and demean both the girl groups in question, and throw girl group fans under the bus. Why? Ultimately, it's a form of internalized misogyny. With how boy group fans (again, the majority of which are female) will willingly throw both female artists and their fans under the bus for fighting for justice and equal rights in the industry, a scenario that benefits all, yet they throw up the horse blinders, kick and scream like petulant children, and will literally tell on themselves that these girl groups, and by extension, their fans, don't deserve any of those equal rights, or recognition that comes close to boy groups and their achievements. It also really just highlights that Korean pop fans, as much as they like to present themselves as woke kiddies, know fuck all about how the world actually works. No better example can be seen then this: Being told by VIP's that I don't understand the big words I'm using like 'patriarchy' and 'misogyny' when in reality, I probably know more about those two words specifically then they have cared for in their entire lives. Related, but people believing that I am a woman, when again, one can look into my pictures, and hell, even my interests, and see that I am a man, and that I understand what I'm talking about more then they are, and I'm still learning, still formulating my points. Really, it just goes to show that when it comes to Korean pop, men still hold the power, specifically within YG, but also across the entire industry. And sycophant fangirls will lap it up and willingly tell against themselves and drag other women across the muddy bog trying to deny them of the rights that often times, is shared. The faster that the patriarchal and misogynistic system which props up the Korean music and entertainment is smashed into bits, the better that women, and indeed, men everywhere, will be. 
 
The fact of the matter is, the first step is admitting that yes, no matter how hard they are kept down, men will often get ten times more chances to succeed then the ones given to women. And that Seungri and CL are related to this. YG is a microcosm of that entire fight. I fully expect VIP's to find this and proceed to fill diapers at how I don't understand what I'm talking about, that Seungri is not to be wronged, and offer (frankly wrong and hilariously one sided) takes on why CL hasn't succeeded. They all miss the point from the forest to the trees: CL's entire career, she has been gaslight, verbally belittled and abused by YG, had her group and her career pulled out from under her feet, and trying valiantly to forge a path, is continually blocked by YG. If you aren't willing to even admit this one simple fact, then frankly, you have no right, and no place, at the table. And I seriously doubt your ability to even comprehend the overarching discussion being had that relates to CL, Seungri, and YG overall. VIP's may be able to stake out a claim as the fandom with seniority, but for the past few days, I have seen with pretty good clarity that really, that's all that they have. If anything, they still act like children when the truth is presented to them, that doesn't conform to their notions developed by both the group, the overarching history as built by the fandom, and what the company has fed them.
 
I'm frustrated. I'm truly frustrated. It's infuriating to put across your points as simply as possible, and be literally belittled and called something you very clearly aren't by people who could care less about the topic. Yet I will persist, because ultimately what happened to CL, and Bom and Minzy and everyone else that was a female employee in YG has happened, is reprehensible, and is apart of a larger pattern of patriarchy and misogyny that had been tilled for years, decades even. 
 
If nobody talks about it, it becomes a perpetual cycle. The same things that happened to 2NE1, are now happening to BLACKPINK. Literally, the same things. When BLACKPINK gets taken out back to the shed and murdered, it's going to be a sweet bit of schadenfreude to hear Blinks and other fandoms say 'why did this happen?!' You were told, alright. You just chose to ignore it, and to label those who spoke of it as pariahs. But it doesn't take away from the fact that it will happen again.
 
It needs to stop, now.

I have been into Kpop not for too long (2-ish years) however this has been a topic I have been very curious about lately.

For veteran Kpop fans, what was it like being a fan back in the late 90s to early/mid 2000s? Compared to now, in which we can access sites like Youtube, Twitter, etc. in the snap of a finger and receive updates/content instantly, what was it like accessing content (updates, subbed vids, album teasers) back then, with technological differences? Also, what was it like witnessing its shift in sound and overall popularity?

For SM stans, how was everything different compared to now? (For example, the Starlight casting system; SMTown songs/concerts etc) Hope I didn't ask for too much, lol. Thank you:)",4,3,False,self,,,,,

In terms of ass cleanliness, here are a few details about my hygiene:

I wash my ass and taint daily with Irish Springs. Stuff is godly.

Multiple wipes per poop. I usually don't get crazy greasy shits, and they usually last &lt;1 minute.

My asshole is kind of hairy. Used to be a jungle before I started shaving once every two weeks. Kind of helped with the smell, not totally though.

The smell doesn't start rolling in until later in the day. It's also not very strong, but I still catch whiffs of it during the day.

I don't usually sweat a whole bunch, either.

Another thing, I don't usually have enough time to make sure my ass is completely dry in the morning after my showers. Could this be contributing to the smell?

I just need to get rid of this nasty ass-smell. It's putting a serious dent in my confidence.

EDIT: Could the nastier farts I produce contribute to this? I can have some pretty gross ones, let me tell ya.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

Who do you think, if revealed to be publicly dating someone, would get positive reception and the least amount of blowback from fans? What about if it were two idols dating each other? ",233,158,False,self,,,,,

Haven't done a fanaccount in a long time, but I am more than happy to be back and writing this one about [Monsta X's Connect Tour!](https://i.imgur.com/WFNOMKS.jpg)

I'll preface this by saying I went to the concert last night with no idea as what to expect as a (formerly very) casual fan of Monsta X. My first introduction to them was actually seeing them open KCON LA back in 2016. I hadn't thought about going, but my friend mentioned it and she wanted someone to go with so I agreed  I liked Monsta X enough and was stoked to be seeing Trespass and Rush live. I entered the concert hoping Monsta X would perform some of my favorite songs by them, and I left the concert with a newfound love for Monsta X and I'm 99% sure they're another favorite/bias group for me!

Let's get the (one) negative thing about this thing out of the way  the concert started at 7:30, but unfortunately they didn't starting letting people in until 15-20 minutes before that (for context, I was seated on the second floor  GA was already in). I only got in and not even two minutes later they started at 7:30. I don't know who organized the event, but whoever was in charge handled the situation unprofessionally  by the time they were finished with Jealousy, a lot of the seats on the second floor weren't filled yet and fans were *still* waiting and coming in trying to find their seats. I felt really bad for the fans who unluckily were in the second half of the line and was very disappointed with how the organizers handled that.

Now on to the good stuff! (Also, if you were there, and see anything incorrect with my fanacc, lemme know!)

First, THE FANCHANTS AND LIGHTSTICKS. Amazing! I was so floored to hear the loud fanchants and how enthusiastic the fans were. As a former casual fan, I wasn't expecting it to be that LOUD. It was incredible! During [Beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/wOtcRJf.jpg) (one of my fave songs by them) the audience was screaming and singing the lyrics along and I was absolutely blown away, it was amazing! Beautiful was literally beautiful live  they were performing it with all white outfits so they looked super glowing in the lighting! It was great.

Next, onto introductions! I don't remember what everyone said, but I specifically remember IM in his introduction saying ""Because it's cold outside, we're going to perform some songs that are going to make it HOT"" and a lot of the fans went wild for that. They performed Gravity, Tropical Night, and Blind after that but personally out of all of them Tropical Night is the one that stood out to me the most  I thought it was okay when I first listened to it but I really grew to love it seeing it live!

The next songs/ments were a bit of a blur, but here's what I remember: while Shownu, HY, Wonho, and Minhyuk went to change, IM Kihyun and Jooheon had a dance-off and Jooheon (and I think IM too) beatboxed a bit! I was really surprised by how well Kihyun spoke English! **ALSO!!!!!*** Kihyun!!!! I would have to write a separate fanaccount just detailing how much I fell in love with Kihyun in the span of three hours but by the end of the night he like clearly solidified himself as my new bias! He was so charismatic, interacting with the fans and waving at the crowds, and his vocals BOIIIIII his vocals were STUNNING. I could literally hear his voice ringing in my brain every time he sang at the concert and I mean that in the _best_ way possible. 

After Shownu/Minhyuk/HY/Wonho came out and the other three went to change, the four of them also had a dance-off! Except instead of dancing, for HY's bit he just imitated Wonho flexing and checking himself out in a mirror LMAO. After they performed a couple more songs, Crazy in Love and All In, and then had a ment. Now (and here's where the unexpected came for me) there were special stages! I was really surprised by them. First was Kihyun, Wonho and Minhyuk's performance of    I was really surprised by how cute and fun it was! I'm more familiar (and like) Monsta X for their really hard-hitting and darker songs (like Dramarama/Stuck/Beautiful/etc.) so to see the three of them perform something so light and carefree and happy was great! They were very cute. Wonho's outfit stood out to me a lot for some reason. Then [Shownu and Jooheon](https://i.imgur.com/h387cde.jpg) did [Versace on the Floor](https://i.imgur.com/VXPlRmB.jpg) and WOW, I did not know that Jooheon could SING like that! [I was extremely surprised.](https://i.imgur.com/8Q436SN.jpg) AND IM AND HYUNGWON'S STAGE! They wore contrasting black and white which I think suited them really well. IM also said later that Hyungwon choreographed the How Long stage and I was really impressed cuz that choreo was great! After the special stages were over, IM stated that special stages were one of his favorite parts of concerts and I wholeheartedly agree  it was great and after that I really appreciated and loved them as performers the rest of the night.

I don't remember a lot in between this and [Because of You](https://i.imgur.com/msGlXju.jpg), except I think the one timetravelling VCR where the fans shouted and screamed a lot, but for Because of You I remember singing along with everyone else during IM's rap part and after the performance, IM expressed how happy he was to hear all the Moonbebes singing and chanting along to his lyrics, and he was really grateful to hear such amazing support from the fans. I also don't remember a lot between this and Destroyer (besides Rollercoaster being LITTT and Kihyun's vocals being amazing) but then they got to Destroyer and! Let me say that I originally did not like Destroyer when it first came out, and I was kind of sad they were performing it instead of Hero (which is my favorite Monsta X song) but seeing it live gave me a newfound appreciation for it! I think the performance and seeing how hyped and beast-mode they were live really made me enjoy it a lot more than I did just listening to it. I like the song much more now. [AND THEN THEY WENT ALL IN](https://i.imgur.com/lfgn56N.jpg) (pun intended) with back-to-back performances of Shine Forever, Rush, Special, and Tresspass! God that was such a blur but it was easily the second-best highlight of the concert for me  just hearing all the songs back-to-back and seeing them perform with non-stop energy and enthusiasm was INSANE. It was like an unstoppable force  they just kept going and going and I remember shouting so loud and shooting my voice rapping along with Jooheon and IM at every bit and singing the choruses for each one but it was so worth it! They were amazing and incredible. I can definitely say that seeing them perform Trespass two years ago at KCON LA and then seeing it again that they've improved TREMENDOUSLY, like WOW! 

OKAY AND THEN THE HIGHLIGHT AND BEST PART OF THE NIGHT. IM introduced the next song and I thought they were going to do a ment before they ended and changed for encore but NO. NO because then IM said ""so for the next song we're gonna show you guys a little drama"" AND I remember getting super excited because when I saw the setlist before hand, Dramarama wasn't on there! So I wasn't expecting it to be performed at all but when they said that I literally got so hyped and sang along with them and agh, let me tell you, IT'S SO INCREDIBLE LIVE WOWOWOWOWOW. I was blown away. It was amazing! IM and Jooheon really kill their rap bits, I mean they did at every part of each song but especially Dramarama, the ""She's like dramamaramama"" line is burned in my head now.

Ending ments! I don't remember all of them but I'll relay what I remember from the members I do: Shownu said he was really thankful and promised they would return to SF! Minhyuk said (in Korean) that he was very thankful for the fans and then had somethingto say but wanted to say it in English, so (in English) he said ""Moonbebes I love you the most!"" (or something along those lines, I can't remember the exact phrasing). IM said he was really grateful and was talking about how yesterday was actually the same day two years ago they first came to the US. For KCON LA! He was very thankful and said he never imagined that they would be having a world tour in SF in a theater two years ago at KCON. Kihyun talked about how they wanted to comeback, and the sad pat of the night was that they were on their last song and had to leave, but it was okay because they'd be back next year, and go wherever the fans wanted them to go! And of course, Jooheon said ""I'm like the terminator"" and did a pause and said ""Cuz I'll Be BACK!"" and I screamed so loud when he said that.

***NSFW Part ahead, read at your own risk***

After performing their encore for Fallin and Only, let me just preface by saying Wonhoe knows he's hot and knows his fans may or may not be thirsty, sooooooo during their last song...when they were singing and performing it, Wonhoe took off his shirt, flashed his sparkly abs (seriously, it was like Edward Cullen met Korean Captain America), rubbed his shirt all over his body, and then threw it into the audience (a fan in the second floor caught it). Wonho then backhugged Minhyuk (shirtless), and then Minhyuk then [proceeded to return the favor](https://i.imgur.com/Fpz8gB4.jpg) and [play with Wonho's chest/nipples](https://i.imgur.com/N7ds9N1.jpg)...I have nothing to say other than that. And that the girl who caught looked very satisfied and the fans around her were asking if they could touch (and smell and sniff) Wonho's shirt LOLOLOL. I get why though.

They were really cute at the end  they bowed three times! Once on the left side of the stage, once on the right side of the stage, and finally in center stage. They all held hands and moved as a group together  it was really cool to see! Had a great time. Thanks for reading!

Nothing wrong with that (embrace the fuller figure!), but it's more than slightly concerning if the sudden weight fluctuation is a sign of a dip in mental health, especially considering she's an idol and not like a regular person.

I don't mean to shame her if this comes across as that, just wanted to put it out there. If CL sees this (who knows maybe she lurks on Reddit lol), hope she sees we support her!

I don't have much to contribute but reading all the comments about how Taeyang never pushed the Boyfriend image so there was a positive response to this dating and also marriage and on the opposite spectrum GD did made for interesting discussions.

It would be cool if you guys could perhaps forego the more popular groups like bts and Exo. Dating in their case, would be akin to Nuclear cyber apocalypse in any case.",241,153,False,self,,,,,

298,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-8-3,2018,8,3,22,949nrd,self.kpop,Any song with this kind of genre that you're listening?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/949nrd/any_song_with_this_kind_of_genre_that_youre/,rosier7,1533303568,"Hello! This year we're flooded with with comeback from various group. A lot of good song were produce but for some reason, (at least for me) most of them are kind of expected in terms of melody, beat and rhythm.

So I'm in the process of creating my own K-Pop playlist that I will usually listen to when driving, walking or relaxing in the evening along. I'm looking for specific genre of music that I like to listen when doing all the above activity.

I'm no expert in music so I'm not entirely sure if this is the right term for this kind of genre but I'm looking for kind-of-RnB-Soul(ish)-Chill type of music where the chord progression and intro is a bit unexpected. I don't know how to clearly explain it so I'm just giving few song that fall in that category (for me).

1. [V - Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8npDG2ulKQ)
2. [Jung Jin Woo - Satelite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMb9pGxv1jg)
3. [Katie - Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAWI6nMQhQI)
4. [IU - Palette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9IxdwEFk1c)
5. [Jung Jin Woo - Rich Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F1xd70JY5w)
6. [DEAN - Instagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKyMIrBClYw)
7. [DEAN - What 2 Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMrYfJGm7kM)
8. [ONCE - Heyahe'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rxYdCfjROI)

If you happen to listen to this type of song, do share it. Would be great to listen to more of this kind of K-Pop song. I don't have that many friends who listen to K-Pop so getting a suggestion is a bit hard. As for western, the closest genre with the above song would be The Weeknd. They have this particular vibe that is somewhat addictive. 

I know this isn't really K-Pop since there's not much ""pop"" in it, but I'm used to call any korean song as K-Pop. I guess it's just a thing in my country xD. ",8,2,False,self,,,,,

What are your opinions on the problem? Do you think its changeable?

In my own(!) personal(!) opinion the scandals always bring bad news for artists in Korea and tbh kpop is run by Kfans and international fans can do nothing about it. I wish all idols happiness and its bad that they cant enjoy the relationship to the fullest but I think it would be better for them not to make fandoms angry any more and deny it. I honestly think even if we wish them as much happiness as we can its useless if the Kfans are not satisfied. I wish it wouldnt affect them but lets not lie, the more popular the group is the more damage it can take but the smallest ones can not survive the rage of Kfans, 
(Not offending any Kfans if they are here but they are just known to be the most affectionate towards idols)

Hello everyone, I went to the dreamcatcher concert in Bogot and Ill try to capture how my experience at their concert was. Obviously Ill preface this with the fact that English isnt my first language and its been a while since Ive written essays or any long form piece so just try to bear with me and if something isnt clear just ask me and Ill try to clarify.

Going back a bit I bought the tickets the day they went on sale, one for me and one for my friend who isnt really into dreamcatcher but thought it was gonna be fun (which it was) so he tagged along. 

We got to the venue and started lining up at around 4:30, the theatre was in a somewhat sketchy area on a closed street (idk how you call that someone help me here) so for the most part I was a bit paranoid that something was gonna happen, either to us or just in general. Stuff actually did end up happening, for example someone broke a glass bottle, and we saw a guy scream at a woman on the street over some altercation they had, initially I thought the guy was shouting at his wife, who promptly responded No one IN THIS COUNTRY speaks like that to me, but in fact it was just some random woman and he went with his actual wife and baby later,  real crazy shit. 

Interestingly enough, there were a lot of street vendors selling unofficial merch to the people in the line, mostly hats and t-shirts with different DC logos. I noticed the guys werent selling too well considering that every time they passed they had the same exact pieces and people didnt seem too keen on buying them. Originally their asking price was 15K pesos for a hat (around 5 US dollars, exchange almost 3K pesos for 1 dolar) and 25k pesos/12 USD for a t-shirt, at the end of the concert the guy was selling them for 10K pesos/3 USD for the t-shirts so I hope it wasnt too rough of a day for them. Annyways damn this is getting long and I havent even begun with the concert.

Anyway, at around 5:40 the line started moving and we began entering the venue, which was really pretty inside and gave me a good vibe. When we got in we were given a number which was going to be used for a raffle but I didnt win so idk what they got. At around 6:40 the venue started playing the dreamcatcher songs so we were sure that the concert was finally starting but the curtains werent opening, so I thought it was a mistake and that someone from audio had fucked up but no, they let You&amp;I, Fly High, Good Night and Chase me play. Surprisingly people were going fucking crazy JUST for the audio of the songs, they did the fan chants and clapped and cheered after every song, and they screamed loud as hell too, the gender distribution of the concert was around 65% girls and 35% dudes so the girls screamed for literally everything and anything. People really where having a mini concert with just the audio before the concert actually started.

So the concert eventually began, and immediately people started putting their phones up to record. We had floor/pit/idk how you people call it tickets and it was standing room only so essentially this meant that we were gonna have to see the concert through these peoples screens and I was just so heartbroken that it wasnt gonna be the experience I thought it was going to be. Fortunately, my friend had the genious (and I mean it) idea of actually moving back, because due to the angle or elevation or like physics dude idk, and we actually had a clearer view of the girls that way.

**Fly High, Emotion and their other ballad uhhhh how is it called**.  


The curtains opened and RRAH, they were there, these K-Pop people we had all been seeing on the internet for our entire fan lives were there, they existed, Siyeon, Gahyeon Dami, JiU, Handong, Yoohyeon and SuA, they were REAL, but even more so, people in this country havent had a K-Pop concert in like never (aka 5 years) so for this new generation of fans that attended it finally felt like K-Pop was something real, that it existed outside of the internet and it was finally in front of our eyes, it was extremely surreal. As for these first 3 songs I personally was just kinda sorting my view so I didnt really pay too much attention to them, plus Dreamcatchers ballads are kind of weak and Fly High isnt their greatest title imo so yeah didnt miss much (I think).

**Group, Individual and unit covers and You&amp;I**

Heres where the real concert started, at least for me. I didnt look at any of the setlists of the previous concerts in the tour so every cover or special stage was unknown to me. I dont exactly know the order in which they came so Ill just try my best to remember.
At first they started playing this sort of weird dubstep freaky music and I was confused as to what was happening, but then the song started playing, **Imagine Dragons  Believer** and holy fucking shit, I had seen videos of the cover and was personally underwhelmed by it, but IRL? Just Woah, they hit every move with inch-perfect precision and punch in it, they really out here looking like they were trying to prove a point, to who? For what? I dont know but they made it look like if they were doing some indigenous exorcist ritual that their life depended on. Every kick, every move, every time the chorus hit they just fucking unleashed, I adored it and at multiple times I audibly screamed Que gonorrhoea, the Colombian equivalent of holy shit to my friend, who despite being as impressed at me didnt really show it, but more on that later.

I think after that they did You and I which was the performance in the entire concert, just the intensity and Dami doing her magic trick which idk where it even came from blew me away. People did the fan chants super loud and went even crazier for this song than the others. If this concert was an album then this was the title track. 


After that, the unit covers started, for every one wed get a mini VCR/Video on the screen hyping up which members where to come. First came Yoohyeon and Gahyeon covering **Tayeon  I**. This was a special song for me since I knew Dreamcatcher had a cover of SNSD ITNW so I really wanted them to do it since I love SNSD, so instead of that we got this and just wow. The song being the power ballad it is gave Yoohyeon the chance of hitting the incredible high note in the middle of the song and it was this magical moment where everyone in the audience could feel it, her strength and the power in her voice. Having never seen anything like it live, through my mind came the thought of Wow, this really what we live for, this K-Pop stuff might be weird and a lot of people might not get it but damn, moments like this are what were here for.

Next up was JiU and Handong doing **Troublemaker  Troublemaker**. Obviously I knew the song was a bit raunchy but JiU and Handong really said fuck this PG shit we doin it how it meant to be done and they WENT FOR IT. There was none of this hover hand stuff I had seen on the performances on Korean shows, they were grabbing each others ass, breasts and anything in between and not apologizing to anyone for it. On the contrary every time they crossed any physical line people went nuts, screaming like I had never heard. Real strong cover.

Coming up was SuA and Dami with **Taemin  Move**. Strong cover but I dont remember much of it, Dami was the most popular member but she also seemed kinda tired.

Finally came Siyeons solo with **Alan Waker  Faded** and god damn. Ya girl was born to be a rockstar, I figured it out 2 seconds after she started singing, her voice just had such projection and she had the superstar vibe going on so hard. When she sang people payed attention, she grabbed us and didnt let us go ever. At the end she set up the microphone stand and kicked it down in a real power move which kinda made me realise that she was the one running shit around here. Thinking back she 100% was the MVP of the concert, not just because of her stage but also because in every performance she was the one who went the hardest, both singing and dancing, she put the concert on her back and if I you asked me who is main dancer and main singer in that group, just based on this concert it would be both her. Back to the song however, my friend commented to me that he actually did know this song, so I was like okay, my boy gonna get hype finally, maybe sing it a bit or something but nope, he just stood there and I know its just the way he is but I think on some way he certainly affected my concert experience, I saw everyone going crazy and in some ways I felt like I was separated from that because I payed attention to my friend having a good time, which he didnt seem to be having even though later he told me he loved it, but also because we were so far back in some ways it felt that yes we could see better but we werent really part of all the concert.

Then came the Q&amp;A segment which was just messy all around, Dami did despacito and every girl did some variation of sexy dance to a song I couldnt really recognize. They did great, all of them. They tried answering fan questions later but the translator was just not good at all, I couldnt understand anything she said so idk what they were asked or what was answered, groups that come in the future get a better translator please, also they did the raffle with the numbers for the prizes but since I didnt win I dont know what they won, maybe I wouldve talked about it if you had chosen me @WhoeverOrganizedThis  but no. They also did the usual K-Pop fan service stuff like aegyo, however they did at one point start kissing, I use the quotation marks because they did that thing of turning around and covering themselves with their hair so no one could see their faces which tells me they almost certainly were faking it. Personally I really disliked this, they more than likely arent kissing like that in their personal lives and I just dont see the need of these world class dancers, singers and performers lowering themselves to doing something they probably arent all that comfortable in doing even if theyre faking it. It aint necessary and unlike in the Troublemaker performance there wasnt any rhyme or reason for doing it other than getting a reaction out of the fans, but they did that all throughout the night based on their talent alone so I just dont see why. Please cut it off.

After that I think they did the B-sides of their newest album, the You&amp;I one which personally I dont care for so I just remember they used Which star as the fan engagement song (i.e to wave to people do hearts, finger hearts, take the flags given to them, etc.) and that I went to the bathroom, nice bathrooms in the venue but for reason the door started opening when I was peeing so like if anyone that owns the theatre is reading this please fix the mens room door dude that shit dont close I promise. 

They also did some Maroon 5 covers but who cares about maroon 5, their only good songs are Maps and Animals.


**Remaining title tracks, Sleepwalking and Full Moon**

This was the best part of the concert. Re-energized after the break they went HARD on every single track, the formations, the timing, these girls danced like they had a death wish or as if their lives depended in this concert only. The line they form in Sleepwalking with the gun sounds, the riffs before the chorus on chase me, good night and full moon as a whole, just woah. By the second these girls were redefining what I believed was possible to do with the human body and the crowd were with them every single step of the way, screaming, fanchanting and getting lost in their music in a way I wish I could have done too, but just my friend wasnt with the hype and I could never immerse myself in the vibe and the mind of the crowd unfortunately. They closed with Full moon and we left after that.

**Closing thoughts**

Couldnt have asked for a better show, on the girls side everything was sharp as diamond. External factors like my friend, who I love but I dont think this is his scene or the translator took me out of the event enough times that I feel I didnt get to enjoy the show as much as I shouldve, which makes me incredibly sad since this is probably one of the top groups in terms of performances in the entirety of the genre. Unfortunately I think my friend was the biggest factor out of those, and like I said I love him but it did really feel like he was there as a favour to me rather than enjoying himself, which I dont want at all. KARD is coming up so I dont know what Ill do, I could get him a bit drunk but at the end of it I just think its better for me to go with people who are more into the genre and allow me to be my real crazy fan self which obviously is hard to be with people who dont entirely get it. Annyways this shit long as fuck I dont think anyone actually read it up unitl here considering Im not that good of a writer, so Im sorry (again).

Best original dreamcatcher songs: You &amp; I  
Best Cover: Imagine Dragons  Believer &amp; Siyeon  Alan waker Faded &amp; JiU Handong  Troublemaker, actually all of them man this group talented af.

You know what to do! Each week you get to listen to one or all seven of these songs, and then you get to leave a review for the songs you liked! Or perhaps disliked, and would like to leave criticism instead. Whether a criticism or a praise, say whatever you want about the song in your review, leaving with your review a score between 1 and 10. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you can review the MV as well but that's totally optional! Screenshots of all the picked songs will be below!

446,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-8-5,2018,8,5,19,94r0r0,self.kpop,180804 CL's MTV Hyperplay in Singapore Fan Account,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/94r0r0/180804_cls_mtv_hyperplay_in_singapore_fan_account/,mentaikoz,1533465762,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a casual fan of CL, so I haven't been following 2NE1's news or CL's that closely. I went with my best friend who was a biiiiiig 2NE1 fan back in the day, so it was nice to reminisce that with her yesterday. It was a free event. This is also my first fan account so I'm sorry if I turn out to be just rambling and not interesting at all :')

It was a League of Legends event with players from ASEAN coming over to compete. On the day I went down the only 2 musicians performing were Sam Willows (a local Singaporean band) and CL. CL was the ending act! My friend and I forgot to print the tickets for the festival and we freaked out after reaching the venue. Thankfully, they allowed us to get through since they were able to scan the barcodes on our phones. We did the usual body check and bag check and all was well, except that we had to go through it twice because we didn't check where the gates were.

CL's set would close off the day's activities at the event, and the estimated time for her set as announced by MTV was 7pm. When the esports match was over, you could see lots of people leave the venue. The place wasn't packed in the first place, but you could tell people came to either watch the match or see CL hahaha. There were many people streaming in to watch CL perform too! Every time CL's name was mentioned, people went wild. They teased us quite a bit before she came out on stage and at that point, most people who were interested in the esports segment had already left so no one was listening to their commentary.

And boy THAT GIRL WAS ON FIRE. She was amazing! She opened up the concert with Baddest Female. She had so much energy and she looked amazing. I was sitting at the third row from the back, so I couldn't see her that clearly from the distance but thank goodness for perfect eyesight since the camera work was pretty bad. 

CL has such amazing stage presence. She completely floored everyone. There were many 2NE1 lightsticks too which was so touching! Although it wasn't the biggest crowd (I'd say it was slightly more than half full) and the crowd wasn't going that wild but CL truly gave her best and performed to every song.

In the middle of the set it was time for CL's ment and she asked us whether we would be okay if she sat on the floor and talked to us (she just finished performing a dance where she was on the floor). That was so cute! She didn't in the end though, and stood up and talked to us instead. She told us she was happy to perform solo for the first time here in Singapore and she thanked Blackjacks and GZBs for coming down to support her. She then performed No Better Feelin' which she has never performed live as she said she wanted to do something special for her Singaporean fans. She also covered 1,000,000 by GD and mentioned that she missed him :"")

CL had so much energy and her routines were amazing. She did her best for everything and her voice was great! One thing that really touched my heart was that she didn't sing over her members' voices when she was performing 2NE1 songs. It was such a nice thing to do as nobody would probably bat an eye if she did a solo rendition of those songs, but she respected her members enough to not cover their voices. She only did her lines and her lines only. 

WHENEVER CL DID A BODY ROLL, I COMBUSTED. I've gained so much respect for her from this 50 minute concert as she really did her best for every stage :"") No regrets going for this concert despite having a lot on my plate because I got to see CL! I liked 2NE1 back in the day so seeing her in the flesh was amazing. She did mention that she loved performing and singing and making people feel ""some kind of way"", and that it was her favourite thing to do. I could really feel the passion she has for performing. Although the turn out wasn't amazing, I hope that she enjoyed her time here :"") I do wish that she could come back for a dedicated solo tour or fanmeeting because this event didn't do her justice. Not many people knew about the event and since it catered to 2 different groups of people, the turnout wasn't great.

She performed these songs (not in order):

* Baddest Female
* Lifted
* Dr Pepper
* No Better Feelin'
* Hello Bitches
* 1,000,000
* Come Back Home
* I Am The Best
* Gotta Be You
* MTBD
* Falling in Love
* Can't Nobody

I might've missed out a few songs as she performed another song or two that I didn't recognise. Thanks for reading!",8,142,False,self,,,,,

For BigBang, which debuted in August 2006, here are the date of their 1st solo concert: 

Taeyang:   July 2008  (&lt; 2 years)
G Dragon  December 2009  (3+ years)
Daesung   March 2013 (7 years;  occurred in Japan)
Seungri     August 2018  (12 years)

For active groups, does Seungri hold the record for the longest time frame?   Taeyang the shortest?  

I'm interested to know about other group's stats.   Or interesting info related to their 1st solo concerts.   For instance, I was surprised Taeyang debuted as a soloist before G Dragon.

I find myself saddened by the idea that I'll probably never see such display of performance talent ever again, granted I should be happy I managed to see them in the first place but still, I'm kinda asking myself, is this the best it's gonna get? Is it all downhill from now on? Not in terms of concerts but just in general. They did say they promised to come back but I'm sure they say that everyone and whilst the girls might certainly have the intentions, what if things never pan out for them to ever come back?

To an extent I'm sure it's normal but it's still a really intense feeling, and i'm scared that in, say, 2 months I'm gonna be enjoying myself at some party or event and still have thoughts of ""I'm having a good time, but it's still not as good as that time Dami made a stick appear out of nowhere"". Essentially that this feeling won't pass. 

Any tips for it to pass?",4,2,False,self,,,,,

This will be my first concert ever in general, so I know nothing about what I should do or how my experience will be like. The tickets for this concert got sold out so I am expecting a lot of people to be there. And I called the venue since my confirmation ticket did not have a seat number or row and the lady told me it's all standing. That being said, I want to be as close to the stage as possible for a great experience and especially since I am 5 foot 3.

I am going to this concert alone because my brother said he did not want to go. And after he saw the prices weren't bad he changed his mind in going but they were already sold out when I tried to buy one for him! He felt bad if I paid an expensive ticket for him and he knows I don't care about so he lied and told me he just didn't want to go to the concert in general. I'm still mad at him, but oh well I can't miss this because I need to go see my crew and have a great time. 

Because I am going alone, I would feel so out of place if I am the first to show up all alone. I want to be there early but not too early. How many hours before the show should I line up for it? It starts at 8pm. And feel free to post any vital tips for me or any experience you had with Korean concerts in general. ",4,0,False,self,,,,,

So, what's your unpopular kpop opinion that would you get you a lot of hate, downvotes, etc.

speak your mind, go ahead

Mine: I do like Loona, and I listen to all of their songs (my favorite are Eclipse and Singing in the Rain) but like goddamn, the company really went with the minimum requirement for talents. Some members are great, but there are a lot of members where I just can't pinpoint what they're good at, or why they're there, other than for their visual (not gonna mention any names) their positions are all over the place. You know how in a group, you know who exactly is the main dancer, main vocalist, etc... but you literally cannot pick out the main dancer, main vocalist or main rapper in Loona without an actual discussion, and even then, everyone has different opinions. I honestly think if they debut, they would have one of the weakest vocal line ever. It's like BBC went ""okay, let's go find some of the prettiest girls around here and let's just hope they have some talents.""",1,3,False,self,,,,,

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Anything else is fair game, no matter how trivial or silly.  Remember, you can ask your K-pop questions any day of the week over at r/kpophelp.

For the most part she's stuck with K-drama soundtracks, which has worked for her, however when will she come back to pop music? I can't recall the last time she had a mini-album come out with a pop banger. I'm not complaining about the ballads she's done lately however she can deliver more and in Kpop you risk being forgotten if you're not out there delivering pop gems. 

Hyolyn (Sistar). It is a non-issue when it comes to her voice: smooth, seductive, versatile. Hyolyn is a star whose singing skills leave you stirred. Sadly her management isn't doing her any favors by insisting in having her come out with tasteless music videos which are more focused on her twerking to the actual song. 

I pray Park Bom will be able to overcome the ""scandal"" because when you are talented as she is, I find it a waste to have her shelved indefinitely over a misunderstanding. It is tragic enough how CL has been wasted or how Minzy hasn't been able to catch a break or how Sandara Park has to find success somewhere else. For all the success 2NE1 got, none of the girls have been able to get their lucky breaks solo-wise. ",17,0,False,self,,,,,

&gt;The members shared their thoughts on making comeback. They also expressed their gratitude on the success of LOVE SCENARIO, the title song from their previous album. The songs success became a driving force in preparing to make their second comeback and making their 2nd comeback encouraging.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DK stated, *The love and support LOVE SCENARIO received became a driving force*, while JAY stated, *Its not easy for artists to make two comebacks within a year, but were happy that we were able to make it.*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;B.I felt the same way. He stated, *Its hard to make two comebacks in a year. The members, staff, and our president, we all worked hard on the album. Please show a lot of love and support.*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;CHAN stated, *We were loved with LOVE SCENARIO. Since its our next album, we all prepared hard. BOBBY added, The children sang to our song. I didnt know at first, but people sang LOVE SCENARIO while hiking. Then I felt like a lot of people like our song. I really felt grateful.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is it hard to release songs frequently in YG? The members stated, *I think its hard When the quality of the song doesnt reach a certain level. Our president lets us release only when the songs are good. He supported us a lot this time and told us, No matter how the results turn out, its not your fault He shared many kind words.*     
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Things have changed after the release of LOVE SCENARIO and their 4th year after making debut. B.I stated, *Our president bought us a delicious meal for the first time. We dined with the CEO for the first time, and now we even have a group chat room. He used to have an image difficult to reach out to. Nowadays, we laugh at his jokes. He tries hard to make us feel comfortable.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He added, *Its our 4th year now. I guess he didnt feel good about being strict and firm to us. He just tries to make us feel comfortable.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Today at 6 PM, iKON will release their new mini album NEW KIDS : CONTINUE on various music platforms. NEW KIDS : CONTINUE is the final series from the trilogy that began with NEW KIDS:BEGIN last year on May and continued with RETURN released this year on January. The album will contain a total of 5 tracks including the title song KILLING ME, sub-title song FREEDOM, ONLY YOU, COCKTAIL, and JUST FOR YOU.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The members had time to review the previously released albums from the trilogy series. B.I stated, *We showed our strong will and image through the song BLING BLING. LOVE SCENARIO was my type, personally. It talks about love and goes from a strong image to a mellow image. This album has more of both sexy and plaintive feelings.*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He added, *Continue stands for our future. We want to create our own outlook on the world and walk towards the end.*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;What do they feel about success. B.I responded, *It would be great if the songs perform well in charts, but thats not the reason were making music.* The members felt the same way.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;iKON emphasized their first intentions. The members stated, *iKONs color is transparent. Were not perfectly pure, but were transparent. What we seek is first intention. Young children have brilliant creativity coming from something. We value the innocence of childhood*. iKON wants to be transparent. They continued, *Our position in the K-Pop scene Were not being modest, but we just want to stay low. I feel like were still at a low spot .*

# iKON Shares Thoughts On BIGBANGs Military Service And BLACKPINKs Success

&gt;In a recent interview, iKON talked about their fellow YG labelmates BIGBANG and BLACKPINK.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked if they feel any pressure to fill up the empty space that BIGBANG temporarily left due to serving in the military, B.I answered, *Rather than feeling pressure because theyre serving in the army or having the fear of ruining the paths theyve created, we are making an effort to work hard and not show an embarrassing side of ourselves.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Concerning BLACKPINKs success, iKON praised the group, saying, *We think BLACKPINKs activities are very amazing. Were not very close to them, but theyre really cool and pretty.*

# iKONs Junhoe Shares Interesting Diet And Exercise Plan

&gt;iKONs Junhoe recently revealed that he went on a diet to prepare for the groups comeback.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At an interview held on August 2 for the release of iKONs new mini album New Kids: Continue, Junhoe started off by introducing himself and stating, *I exercised hard and lost some weight for my new look.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked about the reason for starting a diet, Junhoe revealed, *To be honest, I didnt lose that much weight. I gained some weight during Love Scenario \[activities\], so when I looked back \[at that time\] after losing some weight, I was a little embarrassed.* He continued truthfully, *I didnt realize. We have schedules planned for all the broadcasts and the tour, but I want to take that in looking good. No matter how Im captured \[by cameras\], Id like if there werent any bad photos.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He added, *I decreased my alcohol intake and exercised by a crazy amount. After exercising, I ate almonds and drank a cup of whiskey at night. When drinking whiskey, theres a slimming effect. Its true!*

# iKON Talks About How Their Instagram Posts Used To Be Approved By Yang Hyun Suk

&gt;iKON spoke about the history behind their individual social media accounts.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The members opened their individual Instagram accounts in January. B.I said, *These days, its an era of advertising through social media,* and explained that YG founder Yang Hyun Suk had given them permission. *We intended to show fans our everyday lives and communicate with them through social media, and also use it to inform people about iKON.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Yunhyeong added, *At first, we got permission from him before we posted. As time passed, we got used to it and didnt make any mistakes, so he said to use it freely. Im free to upload what I want to upload.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;iKONs leader B.I currently doesnt follow any of his members on Instagram. Jinhwan made the others laugh by joking, *I guess theres a tradition amongst YGs group leaders that their follower counts must be zero.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;B.I replied, *Its not like that. If I follow one person, then I have to \[follow\] many people, and I thought that might happen, so I just didnt do it at all.* The groups leader then made everyone burst into laughter by apologizing to his members.

# iKON's B.I Reveals Musical Driving Force

&gt;B.I of iKON revealed that his musical driving force is his childlike innocence, which inspired him to create the groups mega hit Love Scenario.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*The song itself has a sad meaning, but I made the song with the heart of a child, with so much joy. I think thats why the song was so popular among young listeners,* said the songwriter-artist during an interview for the groups new album New Kids: Continue in Seoul on Thursday.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Love Scenario, the lead track off iKONs second full-length album New Kids: Return released in January, has been making waves among kindergarteners and elementary school students due to its easy-to-follow melody and lyrics.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Expressing his gratitude for the songs tremendous success, B.I continued, *My biggest inspiration in making music is that childlike innocence. I dont want to lose that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He admitted that he had felt burdened over Killing Me, the groovy and dark lead track off the new album New Kids: Continue, but emphasized that he didnt write the song aiming for success on the charts.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*I dont expect anything with our new song. The process of making it, thats what we value. We wish to stay as humble as we can, and remain as we are,* he said. 

# iKON Talks About Popularity Of Love Scenario And Impactful Words Of Killing Me

&gt;iKON recently spoke about the success of their past song Love Scenario and the impact of the words killing me that eventually influenced the title of their new song.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;On August 2, iKON sat down for an interview ahead of the release of their new mini album New Kids: Continue.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The group first talked about their hit track Love Scenario. After maintaining their No. 1 spot on the real-time music charts for 43 days, iKONs achievements did not stop there as the song began to gain further attention from kindergarten and elementary students in April.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Previously, iKONs leader B.I had commented on this phenomena, but he stated again, *Apparently, the melody to Love Scenario is similar to childrens songs. I wrote this song while having fun, so I think that itself included a childlike innocence to it. I worked on the song with a childlike mind, so I think young children were able to connect with that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Jinhwan commented, *I was contacted a lot by people who havent contacted me in years. I opened up our conversation, happy to see them again, and theyd send me videos of their younger siblings or cousins singing Love Scenario.'* He continued, *I have a lot of friends Ive reconnected with after years due to Love Scenario. Because many people around me talked about it, I was able to really feel its popularity.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The members were then asked if there were any changes after the popularity of Love Scenario.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Chanwoo revealed, *People asked if the company began to treat us any different. There wasnt much of that, but because we became so busy, we started to ride three cars instead of two.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Bobby replied, *My father started to play golf, so I bought him a lot of golf gear. He seems like hes having fun, so as a son, Im pleased.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Yunhyeong added, *Following the success of Love Scenario, I ate a meal with Yang Hyun Suk for the first time. He bought me something really tasty.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The conversation then turned to one of their new track Killing Me. The interviewer commented that although most singers release intense songs for their summer comebacks, iKON released a softer sounding song.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;B.I commented, *It has a lonely and solitary feeling, but rather than saying its dark, the beat itself is exciting, and its an cheerful song. I didnt write the song thinking about the season, so I dont dwell much on that. The lyrics talk of a breakup, but I was influenced a lot by the words killing me. Those words are heavy, but people use it so lightly and often. We used it as the title for emphasis, so when people listen to it, they can relate, understand, and apply it more easily.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;B.I. in turn shared his thoughts of the title and said, *While practicing the choreography to the song, I said Im so tired Ill die. When I thought about what I had just said, I realized many people say Ill die lightly and very often, so I was able to use that as inspiration as well.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With Killing Me, the members of iKON also showed off a choreography with a high level of difficulty.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;B.I commented, *From the choreographies that iKON have had to dance to, I think Killing Me is the sharpest one. We worked hard for the choreography. Yang Hyun Suk told us, You have to work hard for this concept. So through hard work, were trying to dance in unison as sharp as a knife.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Donghyeok stated, *When the members first heard the song, we all decided that wed have to first create a dance performance that matches the song and captures peoples attention with the intense point moves. We thought hard about it, and the difficulty of the dance just came as we naturally created the choreography.*

# iKON On B.I As A Leader And Songwriter: He Can Be A Little Scary

&gt;In a recent interview with Busan.com, iKON talked about their latest comeback with Killing Me and what its like working with B.I, whos not only a friend and member of the group, but their leader and a talented songwriter with main credits to many of iKONs hits, including Killing Me.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Often listed next to B.I on song credits is Bobby, who, with B.I, has cultivated his songwriting talent from early on. For their latest mini album New Kids: Continue, however, Bobby was unable to participate in the writing of the title and sub-title tracks.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Asked if he was sad about not being able to join B.I for those songs, Bobby said, *As a member of the team, I respect and support what our leader says. Within a team, you cant have a big ego. You have to put that kind of pride aside to see good results. I dont feel sad or anything because I didnt write lyrics on a song.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The iKON members said that generally, they defer to what B.I says and follow his lead.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Yunhyeong said, *What B.I makes is usually pretty perfect, so as long as its not weird, we follow along. Jinhwan said he does occasionally offer up ideas, but whether or not those are accepted is up to the original writer (B.I). Hes always a perfectionist when recording or practicing choreography, so he can be a little scary sometimes.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;B.I said its out of necessity. *If I \[give feedback\] jokingly, the quality drops.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But at the heart of everything is the desire to just have fun, said B.I. *We always try to uphold a young and free image. Were all children, and we want to stay that way.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When preparing for a comeback, B.I said, *We always make an effort to not feel pressured. For this album, we dont want much; we just want things to be the way they always were, because nothings forever.* He added, *Rather than the results, we think its enough if we had fun making the album.*

Recently we got news about Pentagon fans demanding Edwan to leave the group on fancafe, now, i actually understand what they mean but obviously it's something that needs to be accepted, when we have feelings for someone lets be honest knowing that they're taken it does make you feel down or less inclined to be close to said person as not to be hurt, now with a public figure/celebrity for some reason even more but i believe it's due to the way they sell themselves, i remember i had this huge crush on this celebrity but once i discovered he actually had a child despite his very young age i felt weird fangirling on someone that is actually a father even though he's what, 21? Obviously i would have never show outrage and what not, it's ridiculous...and crazy.

Looking at Korean fans they do a lot, working their back off (tho yeah I know some are rich but ofc not all) to buy multiple albums, attend the daily music shows after lining up for hours in the cold or hot summer which might be in the middle of the night too and then having to go to work right after with barely any sleep, travel the world to attend concerts, pay for food support, pay for fan projects, pay for ads to be shown all over the country, pay for the expensive gifts, donation from buying stars to litetally building schools, plant trees etc. there is A LOT of money being spent, we love to criticize Korean fans and what we all say about them is true, get a life, stop being delusional, idols have the right to date, it's all true but we internationa fans never think about the actual impact Korean fans have.

I've seen many say that our faves have stable careers because of Korean fans, they're the ones who finacially support them well rather than international Kpop fans who hype them up with tweets or on forums but actually do nothing to support and that is true, so i thought idols are pretty much stuck at a young age, if Kpop idols started to sell themselves like artist do, not selling fantasies, no more fan services 'fans are my girlfriends', the acted look of adoration toward the fans looking them in the eyes and holding hands with meaningless 'i love you' thrown during fansigns, then that would be easier for them, they could date freely, go out and interact freely but that means no more bulk buying, no more ads from fans, no more gifts, no more food support, etc. I understand why they wouldn't spend so much on someone taken, i'd be the same but wouldn't the Korean music industry shrink? Some groups are able to sell millions because of one fan buying 1000+ albums and at this point i'm on a dilemma would the Kpop inustry survive? That is also open another question, Korea should start to build on a bigger music market to stay stable and not depend on idols and the fantasies they sell to people, is there even a solution or another way?

I know a little about kpop, like I have listened to the older songs by Girl's Generation but now I don't really listen to music that often. I have been trying to listen to more music in general and also BTS. I would say she is obsessed with Korean pop. We are both into Asian food and culture. I love hanging out with her since she is super nice and great person to be around. Only wish I had more interested in Korean pop music like her. She is lucky since she is going to likely visit South Korea next year.

Our chart software also ingests the Melon realtime and Gaon weekly charts (to cross-reference and extract more Latin alphabet names for the final table). Only the charting positions were taken exclusively from IChart. With IChart being unavailable now, the table shows the positions from the Melon realtime chart for the time being. If you had noticed IChart's downtime and were wondering where the data is from, this is it.

And to those preferring the reddit redesign: We're planning to add a widget version of the charts table in the near feature!",0,60,False,self,,,,,

They as well according to multiple websites have been getting death threats.

#HereforPentagon
#EdawnandHyunaGotMySupport

It would be really nice as both of these wonderful people actually are staying true to fans and have admitted about the relationship. Hyuna has found someone she has generally liked and both love each other.

My personal opinion:

I prefer BTS over BB in terms of the topics they write about, like mental health, but i highly prefer BB in terms of everything else. Theyre just so unique compared to any group in the global music industry, let alone kpop. Their music production, MVs, vocals, live performances / concerts, and fashion are extremely captivating and beyond any artist Ive ever seen. Even though their music does sound similar to western artists, their albums are versatile, well balanced and has a certain BB flair to it which makes them really addictive to listen to despite that their music sounds like some of the stuff we already hear in mainstream pop. They have a good business sense and theyre the only kpop group that has strong cultural influence. Theyve lasted so long because each member have their own unique presence in the group and are really strong together, and each of them are also allowed some time to pursue a solo career (which the lack of solo time usually causes the downfall of groups). They are the true kings of kpop and I dont think that title is going to be taken by anyone, not even BTS. 

However, I really do like BTS. They actually touch on mental health issues in their lyrics rather than just write about sex, relationships or partying (which not many artists do). They also have more unique and versatile sound compared to the rest of the groups in the kpop industry, which makes me enjoy them more than other kpop groups. I think theyre gonna have their own legacy in the kpop industry, especially for being the first group to really breakout in US charts. However I think the overexposure in the US market is gonna be bad for the longevity of the group (regardless of SK military commitments). Its gonna turn them into the next 1D, or at least make their group mimic the function of a typical western group: churn out album after album until the fans move on to the next trend, or the members want to leave to start their own solo careers. The expectations of the western music industry makes it really hard for them to stay together for a long time. You can tell their exposure to the US market is already starting to affect them: their latest album includes so much more current western music trends (like EDM and Latin pop) compared to their older albums (which mixed classic sounds with more new electronic sounds). The music doesnt have that originality and depth that their older albums do. I think it is good that theyre experimenting with different sounds, but I hope they do more sounds from their older albums because they actually have something special to offer the western music industry.

792,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-8-8,2018,8,8,23,95mh4e,self.kpop,The Most Played Songs in Korea by Group (Summer 2018),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/95mh4e/the_most_played_songs_in_korea_by_group_summer/,kikistiel,1533738507,"Hello all! I had this idea for this post a few months back as I was on my lunch break. I think as international fans we consume kpop a lot more hyper-focused or highly concentrated than the general public in Korea. A group you are pretty in to releases a new album? Even if you don't like the album after giving it a go, you still give it a shot and listen to it. But this post is about what songs are popular to the general Korean public -- as in, not k- or i-fans that are hyperfocused on groups or kpop in general. I know when I lived in the USA, I would hear popular songs but not really be wholly invested in the singers or acts behind them. I would know and kinda like a new Taylor Swift song, but I didn't actively follow TSwift myself nor care about her release schedule, etc. A lot of people here either don't really care about following idols' every release or are very casual fans and just kind of like groups on a really distant level. They usually listen to a single and that's it.

Now that I have lived in Seoul for a while (and I rarely cook and eat out a TON), I've been very hyper aware of what kpop songs are ""popular"" with the general public. What even ahjummas on the trains are humming, or what stressed out high school students with no time for kpop investments have stuck in their heads. I've been writing down the songs that I tend to hear over and over and *over* again, because I think it would be interesting to compare what is popular abroad and what is popular domestically, during the summer of 2018. Kpop played outside of Korea isn't generally played to the general public, it's always targeted to those already into kpop. It's rare to hear kpop organically in the wild in say, the USA. But here, it's obviously normal. So, what songs do the Korean public cling to? What songs are one hit wonders, what songs fade in to obscurity while older ones get replayed?

After looking over the list by group, I think some of the results are pretty surprising. The songs that are played the most aren't always the latest releases, or even title tracks. This data was gathered after many, many months of listening to songs played in a variety of places: malls, stores, restaurants, fast food joints, arcades, looking over the shoulders of people on the train to see what's on their MelOn, and what I hear students singing constantly. 

I list the top played song I hear from a group, and sometimes honorable mentions (not played as much, but still enough to count!) I'm a sucker for IRL real time data mining so, I hope someone else might find it neat, too.

**RED VELVET:** Zoo

Zoo wasn't even a title track and yet when summer hits, I hear it at least twice a day. It was one of my favorite b-sides from the Red Summer album. 

*Honorable mentions:* Red Flavor, Bad Boy

**BTS:** Spring Day

As far as BTS is concerned, Spring Day still reigns supreme. I hear a lot of their new releases when they come out, but Spring Day still soars high and above any other BTS song played. I hear it every time I go out, without fail.

*Honorable mentions:* Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, Go Go, Love Maze, Fake Love

**EXO:** Overdose

EXO is definitely the group I hear the most variety of songs from. Most other popular groups have a few songs cycling at one given time, but EXO is all over the board with what is played. However, Overdose seems to stand out as the go-to EXO pick in public spaces.

*Honorable mentions*: Ko Ko Bop, Growl, Monster, Lotto

**TWICE**: Heart Shaker

Heart Shaker still reigns supreme among all the TWICE hype. Now, it should be noted that Twice is adored by the general public right now, so a ton of their songs get played all the time, that's for certain. But Heart Shaker still takes the cake as the song I frequently hear over my afternoon coffee or in uniqlo at IFC mall. It happens to be one of my favorites too, so I'm happy.

*Honorable mentions*: What is Love?, Likey, Love Line

**Momoland**: Bboom Bboom

This song still is stuck on everyone's brains even so many months and a comeback later. Interestingly, I don't really hear BAAM. I hear it a bit, but not nearly as often as Bboom Bboom still. The public clearly favors BB.

**LOONA**: One &amp; Only (Gowon)

Interestingly, the most played LOONA song right now isn't a subunit title track. Don't get me wrong. Love4eva and Girl Front are quite popular, especially during the summer, but for some reason the Korean public has really clung to Gowon's single. I hear this a lot in clothing boutiques, mall shops, nail salons, and cafes.

*Honorable mentions*: Girl Front (OEC), love4eva (yyxy)

**Blackpink**: As If It's Your Last

This song is clearly the gem of BP in the eyes of people who don't closely follow BP. Songs from Square Up get played a lot here and there, but Square 1 &amp; 2 songs are largely ignored. But As If It's Your Last is played so often, you would think it was BP's most recent comeback. This is a very popular summer jam.

*Honorable mentions:* Du-du-du, Forever Young

**iKon**: Love Scenario

Someone please, please make this song stop. I love iKon. I adore iKon. And I'm so so happy they found overnight success with Love Scenario, but this song has gone TOO FAR. This song has started to be banned in schools because students constantly disrupt class by singing it. I teach THREE YEAR OLDS, and even they sing it! I used to love this song, but it definitely has fallen victim to being overplayed and overused. I hope iKon finds continued to success... but maybe with their newer comebacks. 

*Honorable mentions:* Don't Forget, Bling Bling

**More popular songs by group:**

Gfriend: Fingertip, Rough

IOI: Whatta Man

4minute: Hate

Mamamoo: Decalcomanie

BigBang: Last Dance

Sistar: Shake It, I Like That

Shinee: Lucifer, Replay

Wonder Girls: Why So Lonely

Block B: HER

SNSD: Catch Me if you Can, All Night

EXID: DDD, Up&amp;Down

2NE1: Goodbye, I am the Best

Got7: If You Do

KARD: Hola hola, Don't Recall

April: Mayday

BAP: Wake Me Up

Monsta X: Trespass

Bolbbalgan4: Galaxy, Imagine, To My Youth, Fight Day

Vixx: Shangri-La

Pentagon: Shine

G-IDLE: LATATA

Apink: Mr. Chu, I'm So Sick

Infinite: Tell Me

*Please note!* This is ***not*** an opinion of what I think is popular. This is purely raw data alone. And if a group is not included in this list, I either rarely hear songs from them enough to count as high as the others do (only a few times over the last few months) , or I did not recognize the group/song. Obviously hundreds of thousands are songs are played each day.

One group I did not include is Wanna One, simply because I admittedly have very little knowledge about that group, I'm sorry! I can't really recognize their songs because I don't follow them. Other notable groups I haven't heard nearly as much as I thought I might: Stray Kids, Day6 (I love them so this hurts), Super Junior, Astro, WJSN, Weki Meki, Pristin (also hurts), and a few more. I hear them a bit, but it's really not as much as this playlist I hear constantly up here \^

Do you also live in Korea and hear any different clear standouts from what I've recorded down and shazam queued like a madwoman? Do you live in another country that sees organic, in the wild kpop played? If so, what do *you* hear? Thanks for reading!",60,64,False,self,,,,,

909,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-8-9,2018,8,9,23,95wzmy,self.kpop,[Fan Account] 180809 Blackpink Lisa x Shopee fanmeeting in Jakarta,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/95wzmy/fan_account_180809_blackpink_lisa_x_shopee/,catsnailslipstick,1533825597,"I just got home from the Lisa x Shopee fanmeeting and I decided to write this fan account. There were both good parts and bad parts, I wanna write about all of it so this is probably gonna be a bit long.

The fanmeeting was sponsored by Shopee, an online marketplace. The first 3000 people who made a purchase from YG's official store on Shopee won a ticket to a meet &amp; greet with Lisa. I managed to buy the Black version of the Square Up physical, right when the shop opened at midnight, so I got a ticket to attend the fanmeeting. We were sent registration and logistic details on the app, so we had to exchange our registration number on the app for a wristband on the day itself. It took place at a hall in one of the shopping centres in Jakarta. I attended it alone, btw.

Exchanging the registration numbers for tickets opened at 8 am today, and the gate to the venue was supposed to be open at 1 pm. I got to the mall at 1pm cos I took too long getting ready and there was slight traffic. It was packed as hell already; when I was on the way there I checked some twitter updates and apparently it had been packed since 9 am today. People were already sitting down in rows separated into different groups inside, waiting to exchange their reg. number for the wristband. I was told to wait at an outdoor area (it was like one of those big open areas you have on top of a high rise building) in front of the entrance area to the hall, as they could not fit more people at the waiting area inside. 

I went outside and there were hundreds of people queueing on both left and right side of the door. I had to wait in the Jakarta heat &amp; humidity outside. Thank goodness it was cloudy so there was barely any sun, it was still hot af though. I basically waited outside for about 45 minutes to an hour, I was getting quite nervous because the event itself was supposed to start at 2 but there were still so many people waiting outside. I didn't eat/drink much beforehand (don't do this before any kpop event!) and the heat started to get to me, thankfully I had a friend who brought me a drink and some food from Starbucks. Then the carnage started, probably the worst part of the day. When security started to open the doors, people started pushing and shoving to get indoors. It was really quite intense, lots of people were shouting as people were being crushed and everyone was competing to get inside. The guards opened and closed the door several times, and people were shouting at them to open the doors. After around 20 unpleasant minutes in the middle of it all I managed to get indoors. I vowed to myself to just chill and be calm when I was at the back of the crowd but I was being pushed too so I couldn't help but shout myself...lol. In my opinion, it definitely could have been handled better by the organisers (e.g. put queue barriers outside too) but people who attended were also being very chaotic. I've been to several kpop concerts &amp; events in Indonesia and I kind of expected this, it's almost always chaotic cos kpop fans here are very intense.

When I got indoors it was much more pleasant, I went through security and they asked us to sit in columns. There were groups of people in front of us already, so the idea is you slowly move forward in your columns. They called the rightmost column of people to move forward, then you sit again in a row till they call you to go forward again. This happened about 3 times before we got to the registration table. By the time I was sitting in the 3rd place it was 3 pm already, so I (and most other fans there) were worried that the event had started already since an hour has passed from the original starting time, but the Shopee employees told us the event would not start until all fans were inside, which was comforting. 

After waiting I managed to get the wristband and I got inside the venue. This was around 3.15 pm. When I got in they were playing YG brand promo videos. The hall was packed, there were chairs to sit on but pretty much the only empty seats left were at the back of the hall. I tried to find a seat nearer to the front so I went to the right side of the hall and walked towards the stage, I stood on the side of the cameras for about a minute until someone offered me an empty seat! They were really nice, and I was happy I got a better view. They were playing Shopee and Moonshot (YG's makeup brand) ads on the screen one after the other. 

Then the host came out, the crowd was getting really excited. He did a little quiz with the audience and people who answered correctly would get gifts. Then it was time for Lisa to come out. The crowd was fucking wild when she walked in in the short blue dress. She was so pretty!!!!! She's also taller than I expected (tbf she's wearing heels but still). She has really long, skinny legs and the dress highlighted that very well. She sat down and introduced herself, then the interview started. She was asked questions regarding her opinions on Moonshot, and her favorite products. Then after a short interview she went backstage again. She goes in and out of stage several times throughout the whole thing. After, the CEO (or some high-ranking individual) of Shopee was interviewed on stage. Then they had a game where they picked 5 pairs of people from the audience to do a 3 minute makeup challenge using Moonshot products. The winners were given gifts directly by Lisa and they all took a group photo on stage, super lucky. Then she went away again (she does this several times throughout the event). There were 2 more games, dance battle (I really wanted to be picked for this but I didn't get picked lol) and a charades kind of thing? Participants got gifts too, but not directly given by Lisa this time. There was also the blue bear character from YG (??? not sure) called Krunk who was dancing along lol. He had his own dance moment too which was funny. The last event was Lisa coming out and picking out 3 random people in a raffle to get a gift given by her on stage. I was hopeful but reminded myself to be realistic because the chance is 1/3000 lol. While waiting for the people to come on stage she was waving and shooting hearts to the audience, she is so sweet. She had to leave after that, she said thanks to all the fans who came and told Blinks to wait for Blackpink to come to Indonesia. After she left, the event still went on and the host still had questions with prizes for the audience but some people left when Lisa left. I left before the event officially ended too cos I had to take an important call. And that was that!

Looking back, I can say I had a good time even though there were some bad parts (the pushing &amp; shoving). I kind of knew stuff like that was gonna happen, so I just kind of accepted it. It was a very good marketing technique coming from Shopee; when you think about it, Lisa was on stage for a relatively short-ish amount of time combined, and obviously people there had no choice but to know more about Shopee as a retail platform. I also wished there was more activities related to Blackpink and their music, but I guess this is a commercially focused event and not a concert. At the end of the day, I got to see Lisa in person, and I can't really complain.

Park's ""Fire""** is the only post of a MV that is 2 years or older. Released on 10 Apr, 2016 it is sitting at #28 with 2206 points and a 91% upvote rate.

By the end of 2018, we will likely have the following MV's join this club:

* **Red Velvet's - ""Russian Roulette""**
 * Released on 06 Sep, 2016. Currently at #20 with 2745 points and a 90% upvote rate. 

* **BTS's - ""Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears""**

* **TWICE's - ""TT""**

* **BLACKPINK's - ""Playing With Fire""**

* **BIGBANG's - ""FXXK IT""**
 * Released on 12 Dec, 2016. Currently at #18 with 2832 points and a 86% upvote rate.

The reason I post this thread? It shows us how quickly the community is growing day by day given 98% of the top 50 MVs (in terms of points) were released in the last 2 years, despite this community being 9 years old.

Currently TWICE's ""Likey"" is #1 with 2024 more points than the 2nd highest. Hitting the front page (which I remember this one did) can significantly boost a threads points total.

I strongly hypothesize we will see new MVs enter at #1 on this list soon, so my question for the comment section: **When do you think a MV post will break 10k points?**",17,20,False,self,,,,,

This is my first time posting here so I'm new. Please don't take this in an offensive way. I have a genuine question ask and would love some feedback. 

I have been following K-pop since like 2012 starting with 2NE1. And I just got back to listen to kpop. I enjoy Loona new song favorite in addition to MOMOLAND and blackpink! 

I want to support these artists and groups however I recently found out of the slave contracts that these k-artists are going into. 

I was a huge fan of 2NE1 and I was upset on how they were gone all of the sudden and then I found out their record label were being mean to them and focusing on everything they do such as food and dating and what they say! One of the members brought anti depressents to Korea from the US and the record label dropped them cus it was a scandal thinking she did drugs. 

And I read more about slave contracts and how they have huge penalties and how they are unfair for the artist themselves. And how the artists get paid next to nothing and all the money goes to the record label. Some of you may say ""oh they released new laws and such now"" but BTS is going through that issue now and forcing them on what they are eating and Public image and no sleep! and if they don't listen they get badly panelized. 

I love K-pop and I Wana dive deep into it again. But I am worried with the slave contracts and how the group's don't have any life or money after the band is broken because of scandal or old age (by age 30 I believe?). I don't want my support to injure these kpop groups and make their life's worse in the long run. 

Thank you! ",3,0,False,self,,,,,

It's 6AM in LA. Today is KCON. I've been awake for far too long already, but as a native Angeleno, I figured y'all might want a low down of whats good to do in and around LA near KCON while you are here, in case you run out of things to do at the convention. If you have any questions, feel free to comment or message me, and I'll try my best to respond. I'll be working at the convention (can't say where though) throughout the next 3 days, but I'll try to be prompt with responses. It's mostly going to be a repost of my 2017 Survival guide, with edits to reflect changes in the food scene in the past year or so (LA dining scene can shift rather rapidly), as well as reflecting changes in my personal tastes. 

\##KCON LA Survival Guide

Since you will likely be staying near the Staples Center (unless you live close enough to make the drive daily), youll probably need to eat, and might want to explore the city a bit as well (especially Koreatown).

**WARNING. IT IS HOT. AS. HELL. BRING WATER. LOTS OF IT. LA HAS BEEN VERY HOT THIS SUMMER, AND I DO NOT WANT ANY OF YOU GUYS DROPPING CAUSE OF HEAT EXHAUSTION, AND BEING UNABLE TO ATTEND THE CONCERT TO SEE YOUR FAVES. STAY HYDRATED!!!**

\*\*The Public Transportation\*\* - LA has two main forms of public transit: The Metro Rail and the Metro Bus. The Metro Rail system has a stop that's a 5 minute walk from the convention center / Staples center where KCON is being held. Easy to use, relatively cheap ($1.75 one-way, transfers included, no distance limit. $7.50 day pass, unlimited uses in one day). It runs until midnight normally, and until 2AM on fridays and saturdays. 

Otherwise, driving your own car / a rental car is the way to go, or taking Uber/Lyft everywhere. I wouldn't recommend taking the bus, as I find it much more confusing and annoying, but if you're used to taking it in the city you're from, then more power to you.

\#\*\*To Eat:\*\* 

\*\*Walking Distance:\*\*

\* KCON LA has, in past years, arranged to have food trucks and a few stands outside, near the staples center at Chick Hearn Court, where you can buy food. This is by far the easiest/closest option, and is definitely your best bet if you want to get back to the convention ASAP. 

\* \*\*Original Pantry Cafe\*\* - Might get some flak here from other LA natives, but Pantry cafe is a classic. Serves pretty standard American diner food, but it's an LA icon, and it's right across the street from the LA Live / Staples center complex. roughly a 5-10 minute walk from the convention center.

\* \*\*Broken Spanish ($$)\*\* - Upscale modern Mexican restaurant by Ray Garcia. Really good, but it comes with a price to match. Expect to pay at the very minimum, $25-30 after tax &amp; tip per person, would not be surprised if it came out to $50+. You can read a review by LA Times \[here\]([http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-broken-spanish-20151017-story.html](http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-broken-spanish-20151017-story.html)) **Dinner only!** 

\* \*\*Faith &amp; Flower ($$)\*\* -  Upscale restaurant serving ""California French"" cuisine. Essentially, modern, international food prepared using primarily french cooking styles and local California ingredients. Similarly priced to Broken Spanish. LA Times review \[here\]([http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-broken-spanish-20151017-story.html](http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-broken-spanish-20151017-story.html))

\*\*Short Metro Ride / Driving Distance\*\*

KCON LA has the fortune to be held right next to downtown, and also very close to the Expo rail line, allowing a lot of people, even those without cars, to reach quite a few places easily. Uber and Lyft are also good options here.

\* \*\*Grand Central Market\*\* - Big food hall in downtown, just a few metro rail stops away. Parking is $2-3 dollars for the first 90 minutes, but ramps up quickly afterwards. Several great places here, popular options include Eggslut, Belcampo, Villa Moreliana, Sari Sari Store, Prawn and Wexlers Deli. Honestly, everything here is quite good, and it's pretty hard to go wrong, but those just listed are my personal favorites. They are New American, Burgers, Pork Tacos, Filipino, American Seafood, and Jewish food respectively. McConnells is also a good look if you want ice cream.

\* \*\*Chichen Itza / Holbox\*\* - Technically two separate restaurants, but in the same food court, and run by the same chef. Yucatecan Mexican food by Gilberto Centina Jr. in the USC area a bit south of the convention center. It's 2-3 metro rail stops away, so also very accessible. If you can afford it ($15-25/person), and have the time, its probably one of my highest recommendations for a restaurant in that area of LA, especially Holbox. Absolutely amazing food. Review by LA Times for Holbox \[Here\]([http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-holbox-review-20170313-story.html](http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-holbox-review-20170313-story.html))

* \*\*Mikkeller DTLA\*\* - Danish beer bar / restaurant / coffee house. If you want to get a beer, come here. It's the closest to Staples, and has an insane selection (50+ taps), and everything here is pretty solid. A mix of both European and local brews, and the food is decent. Recommend the burger if you're hungry, one of the flatbreads or the pomme frites if you're not.

\* \*\*Other Options\*\* - LA also has other great restaurants nearby, but they are too many to write in-depth about. A quick list: Birdies (semi-walking distance), Baco Mercat, Spring, PYT, Ledlow, Drago Centro, The Mighty, Nickel Diner Sonoratown, Little Sister, Perch. Be sure to check prices before going, costs of dining can very quickly skyrocket in downtown LA if you aren't careful!

\*\*Koreatown\*\*

The metro rail also runs to Koreatown via the Purple line (and the red line, for a single stop). However, this can be fairly limiting in where you go, as Koreatown is very large. Taking a Uber or Lyft is recommended if you need to walk more than a few blocks, especially at night. Driving is also viable, valet parking is almost universally $2 here. 

Easily the best place to get Korean food in the United States, and arguably one of the best outside of Korea itself. Make sure you have cash handy, some restaurants don't take card!

\*\*IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT KOREAN RESTAURANTS: A lot of the workers here are immigrant workers, often trying to make a living and raise children in LA. However, service standards and expectations in Asia are very different than in the U.S. Most Korean patrons simply want their order and the check, and that is their only interaction with the wait staff.\*\*

\*\*You will almost never find waiters and waitresses asking if you want more water or another drink or how your day was. You will be left alone. If you want anything, flag down a waiter or waitress, or many restaurants have call buttons conveniently placed on the table that will send a signal to the front of house, and they will send wait staff down to you to ask you for what you need.\*\*

\*\*Please, please, PLEASE do not leave a nasty review on Yelp because of this, or because the parking situation was terrible. Parking everywhere in LA, ESPECIALLY Koreatown, is terrible, and bad Yelp reviews have a very real impact on restaurants and the livelihood of the workers there. Please carefully consider before you leave a poor review.\*\*

\* \*\*Sun Nong Dan\*\* - very popular 24-hour Korean restaurant in the heart of Ktown, you can find people here nearly all hours of the day. Likely will be a line here when you arrive. The food is great, recommend getting the galbi jjim (spicy beef rib stew) or the sullungtang (beef bone broth with noodles). Walking distance from Wilshire/Vermont and Wilshire/Normandie stations.

\* \*\*Jinsol Gukbap\*\* - Great option for gukbap (soup with rice), dwaeji galbi (marinated grilled pork ribs) and naengmyun (cold/iced noodles).

\* \*\*Kobawoo\*\* - THE place to go for Bossam (boiled pork belly wraps), and haemuljun (seafood pancakes) Walking distance from Wilshire/Vermont

\* \*\*77Kentucky\*\* - Massive portions of great Korean-style fried chicken. Walking distance from Wilshire/Vermont

\* \*\*El Pollo A La Brasa\*\* - Fantastic Peruvian rotisserie chicken. Walking distance from Wilshire/Western.

\* \*\*BCD Tofu House\*\* - Gonna get a lot of flak from LA Koreans for this one too, but it has absolutely massive seating space if you have a large party, and really, really easy parking with reasonable prices. You're here for the soondubu (spicy tofu stew). Walking distance from Wilshire/Normandie.

\* \*\*Chun Ju Han Il-Kwan\*\* - Great little spot for Budaejjigae (""army stew"", really just an amalgamation of spam, other meat, rice cake and vegetables in a spicy stew). Walking distance from Wilshire/Normandie and Wilshire/Vermont

\* \*\*Guelaguetza\*\* - Fantastic Oaxacan Mexican restaurant in southern Koreatown. Moles here are just divine. Not really accessible by metro, but it's not that far of a drive/lyft/uber from the convention center.

\* \*\*Myeong Dong Kyoja\*\* - My favorite place for kalguksu (noodle soup) and mandu (dumplings). Big portions at low prices, really consistent food. Great place overall.

\* \*\*Here's Looking at You ($$)\*\* - One of my current favorite restaurants in LA. It can get kind of weird, and its this Asian-influenced take on American food. Try place a reservation beforehand, and be prepared for the price (at least $35 a person, easily north of $50) LA Times review \[here.\]([http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-fo-gold-review-heres-looking-at-you-20161026-story.html](http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-fo-gold-review-heres-looking-at-you-20161026-story.html)) Walking distance from Wilshire/Western.

\* \*\*Beverly Soondubu\*\* - My personal preference for soondubu over BCD, but it's much smaller and definitely can't cater to large groups as well.

\* \*\*Yu Chun\*\* - Go-to place for many Korean-Americans for naengmyun (cold noodles). Perfect for a hot summer day.

\* \*\*Cassell's\*\* - Classic burger join in Koreatown. Some people consider it on the pricier end for a burger (around $10 iirc) but I find it well worth the price. Walking distance from Wilshire/Normandie.

\* \*\*Chicken Warriors\*\* - Pretty new spot that does these massive cast-iron pans of Korean fried chicken mixed with other Korean foods. It's a little confusing to get to, as it's in the same building as a different, larger Korean BBQ joint, but if you walk in, then immediately make a right through a second set of glass doors, you'll be in the restaurant. Come with at least 3 people, each skillet is big, and is tough to finish with only 1-2. Great place to drink as well. Walking distance from Wilshire/Vermont.

\*\*Korean Barbeque\*\*

This is, by FAR the most requested thing that friends from out of town ask me to take them to - regardless of whether they are into Korean culture / Kpop or like Asian food, it seems that KBBQ in LA has made a name for itself around the world. As a result, it gets a separate category on this list. Expect to pay upwards of $20 for most places if you want decent quality meat, $15 is generally the bare minimum to get something good.

\* \*\*Parks BBQ ($$)\*\* - More or less THE place for top-shelf korean barbeque, with a price to match. Pretty much every K-Pop celebrity that has been to LA has probably eaten here, including 2NE1, Tiffany, Astro, Monsta X (and many many more, I just can't remember them all off the top of my head). If you want to catch a celebrity sighting, this is probably the most likely place, but I still wouldn't get your hopes up. The food is absolutely fantastic, but it can easily run you north of $40.

\* \*\*Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong\*\* - A Koreatown staple, transplanted from Korea by comedian/variety personality Kang Hodong. Great cuts of meat, in an awesome, if a bit raucous, atmosphere. However, it can have serious lines, especially on a friday/saturday night, so be aware. It's A La Carte style KBBQ though, NOT all you can eat. That being said, it's still going to be roughly $25-35 a person before alcohol.

\* \*\*Quarters\*\* - In the same plaza as Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, this is a slightly more American take on KBBQ. It's excellent food, your wait staff will speak English if that's an issue, and the ambiance and service are solid. It's A La Carte just like Kang Ho Dong though, NOT all you can eat.

\* \*\*Oo Kook\*\* - One of the best All You Can Eat (AYCE) KBBQ in Ktown in my opinion. Roughly $25-35 a person before drinks. 

\*\*Dream\*\* - A bit farther away from Staples on the north end of KTown, they do really good all you can Eat. I go here quite often.

\*\*Places to avoid\*\* - Personally, I'm not a fan of these places, because they consistently fail to put out quality food, or have switched owners so often that quality can vary wildly.

\*\*Bud Namu, Castle BBQ (or Castle II), O Dae San, Hae Jang Chon\*\*

\*\*Farther away\*\*

The LA dining scene in recent years has rapidly expanded, and has made some pretty great restaurants. Unfortunately, many are farther away than Koreatown or Downtown, and I don't want to make this post longer than it already is. If anybody is interested, I can definitely add it in the comments, but I'll leave it empty for now.

\#To-Do

LA in general, and Koreatown specifically, is probably one of the few places where you will get multiple stores selling KPop merchandise. There are three that I myself frequent, but I'm sure more will come up on Yelp. In addition, there are usually one or two booths on the convention floor in KCON LA that is selling CD's and other merch, but usually the store itself will have a larger selection.

I'm not sure what other people would be interested in doing besides eating, so please let me know if I'm missing something!

\* \*\*Music Plaza\*\* - My go-to store. I don't do direct price comparisons, but this store definitely has the widest selection. I've found relatively obscure things like the SNSD Heart to Heart compilation CD. They will always have the latest album in stock. 

 I'm not much of a poster/calendar buyer, but they seem to have a pretty good selection. You can also find those fanclub lights (is that what they are called?) here as well. There's also a good collection of older Korean singers here, like Lena Park, Younha, Lee Moon Sae, etc. 

 It's a relatively small storefront in the Koreatown Plaza mall on Western, so parking is easy, and it's not TOO far of a walk from the Wilshire/Western metro station. I believe they also have a booth at KCON, but the selection is obviously more limited there.

\* \*\*Choice Music\*\* - Another very popular K-Pop store. Definitely more clean/modern than Music Plaza, but I find that they have less variety of albums in stock, as they only tend to keep most things around a few years back at most. However, if you are looking for an album that was released recently, they are guaranteed to have it, and every single variety of it, available. Prices are very competitive, and they seem to have a wide variety of other merch here as well. 

 As an added bonus, they frequently will have pre-order goodies for you, even if you aren't pre-ordering an album. As an example, when I bought TWICEcoaster: Lane 2 from them, they also gave me the little packet of wallet-sized member photos that came with pre-orders, even though I never pre-ordered the album, and I was probably at least a week late in buying the album. 

 It's in the Koreatown Galleria on Olympic and Western, which is a pretty far walk from any train lines. There should be a bus line that runs nearby, but the best option is probably just to uber/lyft there. If you have a car, there is a parking structure attached to the mall, so parking is nice and easy.

\* \*\*Aladdin Used Books\*\* - I really wanted to keep this off the list, as it's borderline not even really a kpop store. It's a used bookstore of Korean books. However, they have a CD section where they sell new and used Korean music CD's. They have a huge variety, I've gotten older albums from Epik High or Peppertones or S.E.S here, but they also carry some of the newer stuff. Sometimes you can get an album for quite a bit less than its retail price, if you don't mind it already being opened.

\* \*\*3rd Street Promenade\*\* - Probably the most popular shopping area in LA. Easily accessible by Metro rail from the Staples Center/Convention center, it's also right next to the famous Santa Monica pier (that pier with the ferris wheel and small roller coaster on it). You can find a ton of your usual American clothing stores in and around 3rd street promenade, in case you needed/wanted clothes or accessories to wear since you forgot something at home.

 It's roughly a 45-70 minute ride on the train to here, and roughly the same time by car. I recommend using the train because parking in Santa Monica is both annoying and expensive.

\* \*\*CGV Cinemas\*\* - One of the few Korean-language theatres in the states, it's located across the street from Wilshire/Western station. They'll usually have English subtitles for any foreign films they show.

\* \*\*The Face Shop\*\* - There are several makeup stores scattered around Koreatown, probably one of the most popular is The Face Shop. There's one in the CGV Cinemas courtyard across the street from the Wilshire/Western Station.

\* \*\*California Market\*\* - Really? A Supermarket? Hear me out - you can get cheap beer/soju/other liquor here to drink at your hotel if that's your thing. Not only that, but there's a solid selection of Korean makeup stores / accessory stores, and a pretty good food court upstairs (on the second and third floors) 

\* \*\*Hwa Sun Ji\*\* - Technically, this is something to eat/drink, but it's an experience in my opinion too. It's probably the only traditional tea house in Koreatown, and you'll see people of all ages coming here. The teas are obviously quite good, and the shaved ice is amazing as well. Walking distance from the purple line.

\* \*\*Sul and Beans\*\* - Another shaved ice place in Koreatown, also very good. It's also in the CGV cinemas plaza, on the second floor.

\* \*\*Somi Somi\*\* - A soft-serve ice cream place, where you can buy your ice cream in a waffle-like pastry that's shaped like a fish. Toppings are good, flavors are good, and as a bonus, it was recently featured by Tiffany of SNSD in her Buzzfeed video. It's also in the CGV cinemas plaza, next to Sul and Beans.

* \*\*Bumsan\*\* - Another soft-serve ice cream place, apparently owned and run by a relative (relatives?) of Sunny (Sunny of SNSD). Good soft serve, makes for a really nice insta pic. A bit on the pricey side for many though, but it does taste pretty good.

\#To Drink

I understand that not all of you are drinking age in America. For those of you who aren't I recommend \*\*Boba Time\*\* in Koreatown on 6th Street and Alexandria if you want boba / bubble tea / pearl milk tea. \*\*Document Cafe\*\* \* and \*\*Space E.Um Cafe\*\* (full disclosure, I'm friends with the owner) are also personal favorites of mine if coffee is more your thing, and all are within walking distance of the Purple line train stops. \*\*Coffee Colab / No Ghost Bears\*\* is also a great (if absolutely tiny) coffee shop on the southern end of Downtown LA. \*\*Prism Coffee\*\* is probably my current favorite, and just past the western edge of Koreatown. They roast their own beans, and make some pretty good pourovers (but those can get expensive, get a cold brew if you want something more reasonable) As a bonus, Space E.Um, Boba Time and Prism sometimes play KPop, so it's a fun little game to see what songs you recognize.

However, for those of you who are of drinking age and are going to KCON, you're in luck. The bar / brewery scene in LA has massively improved over the years. Some personal favorites:

\* \*\*Everson Royce Bar\*\* - Probably one of the most popular bars in LA, and for good reason. It's also a personal favorite of mine. Absolutely amazing cocktails, great food food, and great beer. Insanely extensive selection of straight liquor as well, if scotch/whiskey/bourbon etc is more your thing. A relatively short hop away from the convention center by car or uber/lyft.

\* \*\*Beer Belly\*\* - Great craft beer place in Koreatown. Walking distance from the purple line, Wilshire/Western. Food is average in my opinion, but it has a great, constantly rotating selection of local craft beers on tap.

\* \*\*Gaam\*\* - Very popular korean fusion bar in Koreatown, right next to Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong. Decent fusion food, good variety of cocktails, walking distance from the purple line. THE place to go if you wanna go somewhere loud but not too club-like and want to party it up with a bunch of friends.

\* \*\*OB Bear\*\* - Classic Koreatown bar. You're definitely here for the beer (specifically the Korean OB Lager) and the fried chicken. About as ""authentic"" as a Koreatown experience as you can get. Walking distance from the purple/red line.

\* \*\*Birds &amp; Bees\*\* - Nice little underground cocktail bar in downtown. Has a small beer selection as well.

\* \*\*Spire 73\*\* - Currently the title holder of ""America's tallest open air bar"". Great views of downtown from the rooftop bar 73 floors up, you can find it in the brand new Wilshire Grand building. 

\* \*\*Arts District Brewing Co.\*\* - Beer brewery in Arts District. Very popular.

\* \*\*Mumford Brewing\*\* - Beer brewery in Little Tokyo, personal favorite of mine. Be aware though, they close quite early (9PM)

\* \*\*Highland Park Brewery Chinatown\*\* - Newly opened branch of Highland Park Brewery, a personal favorite of mine. Awesome new space, solid menu of bar foods, and some great beer, especially IPAs and Sours.

\* \*\*Boomtown Brewery\*\* - Beer brewery in Arts District. Focuses on mostly lighter beers and pale ales/IPA's it feels like. They have some pool tables and other spaces to play games.

\* \*\*Iron Triangle Brewery\*\* - Beer brewery in Arts District. 

As an LA native, I want r/kpop to love the city as much as I do, and experience the best of what it has to offer. KCON LA is going to be great!",71,354,False,self,,,,,

I'll go first: 

-----

I didn't like Hyuna at first buttt I have never seen anyone who can pull off sexy and cute so well!!!  She is the perfect combination of sexy and cute and after watching her realise she needs to train a girl group who can have her sexy/cute duality and I'm certain they can be in the next big 3.

Nancy momoland I disliked her because of all the rumours until  I realised how absolutely baseless they are. Im shocked at how anyone could direct so much hate to a young girl for absolutely nothing. The ONLY thing there is proof for is the bulimia joke but when watched the video she wasnt being hateful it was an off-minded comment as a response. Its crazy how people call her so many bad things without any solid evidence.  She must be strong to not break down over the hate. There is no way being a 2000s kpop star she doesnt read comment and kpop forums and it may sound odd but she must be resilient to be so young and not let it get  to her. I know she gets a lot of love but as humans the hate gets to us more and she is strong for not letting it get to her. 

Sunny I feel bad for disliking her because antis kept on going on about how she was only im SM because of her uncle, until I actually listened to GG sonhs and realised how much I loved her voice and how in the entirety of kpop I cant think of anyone who sounds like her she is the Bom of SM.

Yeri gosh I never hated Yeri but always felt she lacked so much compared to the other 4.  But honestly I learned more about her and how mentally resilient she was and carried RV through variety shows and a really unique voicr made me like her a lot.
-----

I stanned Twice from the begining but I don't feel the same about them anymore. I get they rock visuals, are good dancers, have sweet and nice personalities, but its been 3 years and their singing is subpar. Only Nayeon, Jihyo, Chaeyoung and Jeongyeon are stable, but even then the singing is good not great or spectacular, and normally I would be okay with a kpop groups only having half average sounding stable singers but the amount of insane recognition Twice recieved?   It just simply isn't fair on other groups who can sing AND perform very well.

Before anyone gets mad it is jyps fault. He doesn't care about abilities, just money. Its obvious Twice has potential, they need fulltime lessons to work on their singing. But he is just pumping 4 title tracks + 3 japanese tracks a year, which takes up all of their time. Listen dude they need lessons and training.  

He also RARELY lets them sing live. Only 3 sources of Twice singing live I dont trust mr removed videos as I know they distort sound. Encore vides (I think there are 3 availible on yt.) They sound OK, mina is too quiet, the other members sing over sana and momos part LOL, Tzuyu is improving slowly but needs practice, and the other 4 are stable but not strong. Ill take this with a grain of salt since they were probably exhausted but jyp you have to give us something?????? LET THEM SING LIVE ONCE ATLEAST TRAIN THEM FOR IT. 

Literally the ONLY thing there is of them is the What is Love Acoustic, which is good but could use a lot of improvement. It was in a lower range and wil is one of their easier songs. If jyp had any integrity for the group he would released a live standing version for each of them!! So yeah I still like Twice but am waiting for the day they can prove they've improved enough to stan them.

For the past year though I have been branching out from mainstream K-pop into Korean music in general. 

Mainstream K-pop has been great but it has also been a joy discovering music from a wide range of K-genres. I have usually stuck to my own playlist which has (to me) a great mix of mainstream and indie Korean music but haven't given much thought into what other people listen. 

So I want to know, what is your go-to K-pop playlist on Spotify?

But lets say range, stability, ability to sing live, high notes etc, uniqueness in voice, etc.

The 2 that really come to mind for me are Wendy and every Mamamoo  member. I listened to their [live](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pcTJ1f05T8U) and it was just amazing how good they sang!!! 

For Wendy my favourite [live performance](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=88VRss2U4Lk) is this one!! Infact they all sound really amazing here, not only are they big 3 but actually can sing amazing too. 

Her octave range is Eb3 ~ Eb7 (4 octaves) which is pretty amazing. 

Wendys voice itself might not be that unique but the other 4 have really unique voices, even as a total newbie fan before I could even tell them apart from their faces I could tell them apart from voices. 

Jennie also seems like a pretty stable singer, in all the black pink lives Ive scene her singing sounds good. ",20,1,False,self,,,,,

####20180625 Showcase  

NU'EST W announced they would have a showcase for the release of their album and I knew I wanted to go. It was first announced that 1500 fans would get in through an album sale lottery. I had to figure out how top preorder through the five listed Korean sites. I preordered my albums and kept an eye out for the notice... And I did not get in. However, I did not have to wait long before my second chance. 1000 more fans would be able to get in through application on the fan caf.  
At the application time I had my form all prepared. I remember sending it in and how it loaded for 4s before the application sent site appeared.  
The list of who got in was announced the next day. I remember opening the form on the metro, scrolling down, and the list wouldn't load further than 590 on my phone! Person 590 had sent the form in at 1s past the given time, so I figured I probably did not get in. However, once I got home I couldn't resist still checking. And there I was! In the 800s! I got in!  
  
The day of the Showcase I went early. In fact, I went so early no one else was there... If it wasn't for the big poster I would have thought I was in the wrong place. They had announced the sale of [mirrors](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1011130611556339714) and I knew I wanted one. Tickets had been announced to be given out randomly, rather than in order, so the seat would depend more on luck than who lined up first. So I got the mirror first, then lined up for my ticket.  
I ended up third row in the [back right floor area](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1011134367484260352), , which was a really good seat! I had a good view of the stage, and felt like I was in the middle of the vivid pink ocean.  
  
The [showcase](https://www.vlive.tv/video/76755) itself was amazing! Park Sungkwang from Night Goblin was the MC for the night, and all of us were so happy to see him again. Nuble started by performing Look, Where You At, and . It was incredible to be part of Where You At fanchants for the first time irl rather than behind my screen! Then there was a talking segment, where they gave us mysterious hints (oh before we knew about the goat..). Then they went out, and came back to perform Polaris. Polaris, such a great song and choreo. I remember watching in awe how beautiful it was and the symbolism of the light. The song finished with messages left by fans at the box tour. Even if I only could understand a few of the messages, I remember awwing and occasionally laughing with the other LOVEs.  
Then there was no break, we got the Dejavu MV.  
The release of the MV had been delayed, so at this point no one had seen it. Being in a concert hall full of other LOVEs screaming as we watch the MV for the first time, together on a big screen, is something I will never forget. We were all alternating between being in stunned awe and screaming our lungs out. The most memorable moment was went it went quiet with confusion because of the goat's scene. Then switching to the loudest scream of the MV as blue-eyed JR appeared for his rap part. I'm a bit sad they didn't keep our reactions in the vlive!  
The MV ended and we barely got to breathe before Nuble came out and performed it live!  
  
The showcase was my first time seeing NU'EST W, and I was overwhelmed afterwards. I and the Hong Kong LOVE next to me were just in awe and it took a moment before we got up. We decided to get something to eat together afterwards and to talk about how incredible the showcase had been.   
We ended up meeting up a few more times at other events, she is so sweet!

####20180628 MCD Night prerec + live show 
 
#####Prerecording

NU'EST W's first comeback stage was at MCountdown, and I was lucky enough to be among the 400 people who got into the late night prerecording. I even managed to get a number lower than 100! The kpop gods were smiling upon me.  
  
Night recording are a long wait. The train stops to run at midnight, so you have to get there before then. Shawols were lined up for SHINee's prerecording before NU'EST's. This was the first stage for Our Page. I remember seeing the Shawols cry as they got out from the building.  
  
Staff checked our items and handed out [fancards](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/200820245563310080/461537217840414721/image.jpg) ([inside](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/200820245563310080/461537227252563968/image.jpg)) and [photocards](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1011985179039227904)
  
MCD night was the night of Korea's last World Cup game. I wonder if that was related to the recording starting late, haha. The prerecording was supposed to start at 1AM, but was delayed an hour. We waited outside at first, but we were let into the building on time, so we got to wait inside during the delay. We had been given the fanchant lyrics and a video a day before, so at this point we all knew it. A few minutes before we were let into the studio, they started playing Dejavu inside. Everyone immediately took the opportunity to do the fanchant, and a laughing staff went up to hush us. They kept playing Dejavu, so we couldn't resist to whisper or mouth the fanchant instead.  
  
We were eventually let inside and wow. The stage was so impressive! We were all ohhing and aahhing, especially when they started testing all the light effects. Im a bit sad they didnt include some of those during the performance. I ended up second/third row, with a quite good view of the stage. Stage staff kept running around and fixing details, checking the chandeliers and moving the curtains. People on the left side kept occasionally screaming, as they could see backstage a bit. The screams increased and NUEST W went up on stage. They greeted us and started right away. The first recording was pretty much us constantly screaming except for when we had to do fanchants. The boys didnt say much, they bowed and waved and went off stage once they finished.  
  
They performed three times in total, and overall they didnt say much, they mostly just smiled. Aron is a freaking bias wrecker, he looked so good performing, and really kept giving killing looks.  
  
The second time NUEST W performed we were screaming at JR before they started, since he had a piece of glitter stuck in his hair. Ren had just waved and given us hearts, and thought it was him first before he and Baekho spotted the clueless JR. Baekho also tried to give Ren his mic to say something to us, but Ren declined, and they lined up to start.  
  
The third time JR wanted Baekho to do something with his back before they started. But Baekho didnt understand what JR wanted and just patted his back awkwardly. JR then told him again and Baekho still didnt get it, and just kind of poked him. Afterwards JR tried to adjust his mic box and cable on his own.  
  
Each time they performed, the fanchants got louder and we got better at not screaming when we werent supposed to scream. It was a good idea to make JRs     a fanchant line, because the screams when JR pushes his hand thought the mirror would be insane.  
  
After the third time it was over and we all started to head out. On the way out we saw Bumzu outside the studio. LOVEs cheered enthusiastically, we all love Bumzu.  

#####Live Show

I had gotten live show tickets for MCD in advance, so I already knew long ago that I would see the live show. However, the day of MCD I ran into a dilemma. JRen MCs. Now, MCD has two stages. The main one in the front, and a special one for the MCs in the back corner. JRen would be at back, Polaris performance in the front. I first ran a poll on twitter to help me decide. But then my group lost at rock-paper-scissors and got to go in last out of the tour groups. Which meant my options was forth row at main stage behind 100 j-shawols, or second row MC stage. JRen was there when I got in. I made the right decision to pick the MC stage. It also made me surrounded by LOVEs. My people!  
  
At the MC stage, JRen were so nervous beforehand. They kept taking deep breaths to calm down and were reading their ments over and over. We screamed hwaiting! to them a few times. JR barely looked at us, while Ren occasionally waved or gave hearts. Ren also chair-danced to some songs. He did Momolands Boom Boom hand moves when they were performing Baam. JR calmed down a bit as the show continued and occasionally smiled to us.  
  
Between their ments they sat on chairs behind the stage and practiced their ments. Occasionally they watched the stages. Mostly for their friends. They watched a lot of TheEastLights stage, and also BTOB. Of course also their own Dejavu stage, as they quickly went back again after Polaris instead of performing.

Speaking of Polaris, we got the fanchant maybe one hour before the live show. Thank you Pledis. So when NUEST W went up to perform Polaris, all LOVEs got their phones out to read the fanchants. We ended up skipping some where we didnt know the timing, but got the easier ones. Its so much more fun doing fanchants in the right section! We were all screaming and the girl next to me made me almost deaf with her screaming at one point. 

Dejavu was immediately after Polaris. As they had prerecorded it and JRen had to get back to the MC stage, it was just played on a projector for us and not performed at all. But since I had seen it at prerec it was okay. JRen watched it and thanked us afterwards and we screamed back to them. 

JRen stayed in the back until half way through SHINees second performance. LOVEs were so sweet during SHINee, I saw a lot of LOVEs change lightstick colour to green (closest we have to pearl aqua), so I changed mine too. I love friendships. 

After SHINee, MC JRen went up on the main stage and all lightsticks turned vivid pink again. We cheered as they walked up on stage. It was cute how they greeted the other groups, and JR especially looked close to BTOB Eunkwang. 

They werent as bubbly as usual, which was probably due to nerves and tiredness. However, during performances they were so professional, so we LOVEs did our best to be as professional. 

--- 

####20180706 Music Bank Walk  
  
Music Banks walk, when artists arrive to the studio for interviews, filming, styling, etc. takes place early in the morning. So early that the metro hasnt started running yet. I met up with two LOVEs I had gotten to know over twitter to share a cab there.  
We got there maybe around 5am, and the line was already long. Fortunately I spotted the Hong Kong girl from the showcase, and we were able to join her at her spot a little bit ahead.  
  
There were a lot of fansites that lined up all night to get a spot at the good area, where the idols stop to pose in front of the professional photographers. I ended up a bit down the walk instead, at the part between the parking lot and the studio doors. This meant I saw NUEST W for about 15s. But those few seconds were worth getting there early for. Both [JR](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1015387973565599744) and [Ren](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1015567005238226944) looked straight at me and smiled, and I even managed to take a few photos. Baekhos tattoo was visible, so now I can say that I have seen his tiger tattoo in real life. Aron was looking flawless even with next to no styling. They were all wearing Hang Ten clothes, as the good models they are.

####20180707 Mini fanmeeting + MuCore live show 
  
#####Mini fanmeeting
  
NUEST W had announced a mini fan meeting before Music Core the second week, as they wouldnt prerecord. I had applied for it, and failed to get in. However, it was at a public place, so there was nothing stopping us from showing up to watch from far away.  
  
I met up with the Hong Kong girl again to watch together. It was a super hot day and the sun was strong. Yet probably around 1000 LOVEs showed up, even if only 450 had officially gotten in.  
Security arranged us so that we wouldnt have a better view than the people who got in, so I couldnt see well. At the end I even decided to cross the road to watch and get a bit better view.   
  
NUEST W were happy that so many people had come there, and waved to us in the back too. They did a few ments and games, and also danced to Bboom Bboom. All the LOVEs who had gotten into the mini fan meeting got electric hand fans from NUEST W. I ended up seeing people with them at various events, and cant help but be a bit envious.  
  
#####Music Core live show  
  
While in Korea, I was taking a Korean class. It also included various culture experiences. This week we were able to sign up for a Music Core tour, and thats how I got to see NUEST W again.  
  
Music Core has seats, unlike M Countdown, which is all standing. There is a small pit in the front for the people that get in through the fandom, but I was in the seats in the back. I still had an amazing view and got to see NUEST W again! The shawol next to me kept giving me weird looks during the Dejavu fan chant though, haha! At the moment, NUESTs international fanbase in Korea is quite small.  
  
One detail I thought was really cute was at the winner announcement. It was NUEST W versus Blackpink, and NUEST W ended up on the side closest to the stairs, with JR just by the stairs. Unfortunately, we did not win, but before that, while the other groups were still going up on stage, JR caught my eye. To every single idol going up on the stage, he greeted them with a full bow. He kept going up and down, as the other groups walked up one after another. He greeted both seniors and juniors. He did not stop bowing until all groups were on stage. Such a JR thing to do!

####20180711 ShowChamp prerec  
  
It took until the last week of promotions until I got into another recording through the fancaf. I applied for every single one, but with NUEST Ws current popularity getting in is not easy. However, Show Champ prerecords around noon on Tuesdays, and I finally saw my name of the list of people getting into the prerec again!  
  
Show Champion Is being recorded at MBCs studio in Ilsan. For people who dont know it, its far out. Like three stops from the subway end station far out. Never having been there before I decided to be early. I ended up getting there an hour before check in, and stood and watched Day6 and Golden Child fans line up. While I waited more and more LOVEs showed up. Eventually Day6 and Golden Child fans went up the stairs towards the studio.   
  
We LOVEs were arranged in three lines. 0-100, 100-200, and 200-300. Since my number was in the 200s this time I ended up in the third line. Then we waited. After some time, we had a fan club card and album check. Then we waited again. Then they started to hand out photocards. I got [Aron](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1016929213796896771) this time and omg he looks so good! Aron is really my bias wrecker this comeback. I screamed so much when I saw him perform.  
After photocards we waited again. Gyeongree fans started to line up next to us. They were fewer, but I noticed one of them was non-Asian and about my dads age. I love the diversity of kpop fans! He had the lightstick and everything! The Gyeongree fans were let up the stairs, and some time later we got to go up to. And then we were told to sit down and wait again.   
  
After doing prerecs Ive learned that they will always take longer than scheduled. They are tiring and there is so much waiting for just a couple songs. But for me they are definitely worth it. The Gyeongree fans and the first maybe 80 LOVEs were let in to watch her prerecording. Afterwards they came out and the LOVEs sat down again while the Gyeongree fans left. After another wait we were let into the studio.   
  
The way there was clearly unglamorous backstage. Back drops and other stage decor took up most of the space in the room we walked through. Mnet has hidden that for the fan areas of the MCD studio, and same with MBC and the MuCore studio, but this was rawer. 
  
Eventually we reached the studio. The stage was simple this time. Just the regular screen effects, and no fancy backdrops like the MCD comeback stage. We LOVEs crowded together, but there was next to no pushing. We screamed at random points a few times just because everyone else screamed, then laughed because there was nothing there. After a few false alarms, a speaker voice told NUEST W to get on stage. We all cheered. Ren walked out first and waved to all of us. Then he looked around and jokingly waved towards the direction he came from to get the others to come out.   
JR emerged a moment later. He and Ren did a half high five, half handshake greeting and we screamed. They looked amused at us. Then Aron came on stage and we screamed again. He waved. Then Baekho last, with a smile, and they went to stand in the position to start the song. They looked so much calmer this time than for the first MCD recording. Now they know they are doing well and are more comfortable with the song and choreo now.  
  
The speaker voice counted down: 5 4 3. The music started a moment later. We cheered and screamed and then immediately started the fanchant. NUEST W are so professional on stage! And they looked so good! They wore the same outfits as at the radio show earlier that day. All of us LOVEs watched the radio show stream while in line. 
  
Their first performance finished and NUEST W waved to us and went offstage. The crew started to review what they had filmed and decided to show it projected to the stage for us! We were delighted and screamed at every close up. The crew clearly enjoyed it, as they rewinded a couple to show us again. The most screams were at JRs wink at the mirror part. And I heard the girl behind me talk about it, winkeu, winkeu and fangirling so much.  
After reviewing we were told that they would come out again. We all cheered! And even more when we spotted Ren! Ren was first out this time too. He waved to us with a big smile. The others took their time and Ren jokingly pretended to throw a fishing hook and reel them in. And he kept pretending to reel and reel as they didnt come out, we laughed! So Ren decided to do that in our direction instead! We all screamed!   
Eventually JR walked out on the stage again and smiled and waved to us, then Aron and all of us went whoaaaaa because he looked so good, and he looked confused, so we laughed. Baekho was last again and hurried to his position so they could start, flashing a quick smile towards the audience. The performance was so beautiful. The confetti almost looked like rain this time. And NUEST W looked so good and did the choreo so well.   
  
After the second performance we were told they were done and were ushered out of the studio. We picked up the bags we had to leave outside the studio and went down the stairs.
In the lobby, fans going to the live show were lining up, and staff waved the NUEST W sign to us to show where youd line up if you were one of the lucky few who got into the live show as well. 

On the way out I took up my phone to check the fansign list for the Friday that week. It got published while we were in the studio. I got in. Spending all that money was worth it, Im knew I would be seeing NUEST W again, and up close.

####20180713 Fansign  
   
Since I know this will be asked, yes, I had to buy a lot of albums to get in. I rather not specify the exact amount, but I ended up spending over 1000USD on albums.  
  
I made it to the venue a bit early and had to wait before we were let in. As we were let into the fansign room, we each drew a number. I drew 83, which placed me on the second to last row, and among the last people to go up to meet NUEST W.  
  
After we had all sat down and the fansites had set up their cameras, Baekho walked in. He was the first one today and started talking to us and making funny and cute faces. Ren was next and the two of them started to talk more to us.  
Then they asked the fans there from where we were and I saw my time to shine. Their surprise was so cute!! They first said something in Korean and I managed to say that I only speak a little Korean. Ren then asked me why I went to Korea in English and I died. The entire room was in surprise from how good his English was. He has a really good pronunciation, and asked me with perfect grammar here. Later I would learn that his vocab was a bit more limited, but he surprised me so much here.  
I managed to reply that they, NUEST was the reason I went to Korea. I was also studying Korean, but Id lie if I didnt say that understanding NUEST VLIVES is a major motivation behind my studies NUEST W are the reason I went to Korea.  
  
JR was next and we ahhed and oohed when he walked in. Aron was last. While Aron was talking Baekho and Ren kept messing around with his picture in the backdrop and made funny faces with it. Aron couldnt understand why we were laughing so much! They all wore the gray suits from the music show earlier that day. JRs shirt buttons kept opening themselves and he kept trying to button them up again.  
  
Most of the signing went by in a blur. Various things for them to wear, Baekho got two swords. When he got the first one he walked around with it and a rose in his mouth! At one point Aron had to get up and go out. He returned with a cold soda can that he held up against his throat. Afterwards he told us several times that he was fine, so hopefully it wasnt anything serious and just that he was tired after the MuBank performance. They were given so much headbands and hats. I took a lot of photos with my camera, even if I also made myself just sit there and look and enjoy the moment at times.  
  
The order they sat in was Ren-Aron-JR-Baekho. I was so nervous as I walked up. I had two post it notes for Ren and JR, but staff made me remove the extras to only keep one. One day I will learn if JR prefers Jonghyun or Jonghyeon  
Ren was looking away as I first walked up on stage. Baekho had been given another sword and walked around with it. But as soon as he spotted me he was all smiles. There was a bit of a communication barrier. There is a [clip on twitter where Aron helped him]() at one point with the English. It was mostly me trying to speak the little Korean I knew and him asking me things I didnt understand. Unfortunately, Aron translated the wrong part and it wasnt until later I learned that he had asked me how much I like Korea. Sorry Ren! Next time I will answer you something other than nonsense. He was so sweet and really tried to talk to me! We did a kind of awkward half high five, half hold up hands and touch them before I moved on.  
  
Aron was next! We talked a bit more since I could do English this time. I was maybe a bit too overwhelmed even for English, but I managed to talk a little so Im happy! I asked him how to learn Korean faster and he told me to use it as often as possible and that most people would try to help me out. He also asked me if I like Korea and what I think of the food. I managed to say that I really like Korea, and the food too except the spicy food. We also did the awkward hand thing. Next time I want to ask him if he ever browse international kpop communities. I left a letter to him where I wrote out the link to r/nuest, so maybe he will visit!  
  
Next was JR. He did an aegyo *annyeonghaseo~* to most people, but cut off halfway through it when he saw me and went *oh! Hello~*. His English is the most adorable thing ever. I had asked him to draw an onibugi on my post it note, so now I have my very own onibugi!!! While he was drawing it he grabbed my hand with his other hand and squeezed it. I died. His hands were so soft. I did not manage to say much to him, hahahah. When I got up to move to Baekho he told me *have a good day~* in English, hes so precious!!!   
  
Baekho was next.  He immediately said oh! Sweden! when he saw me, so he remembered me from the beginning of the fansign! I jokingly apologised for the World Cup, because I knew he watched it, and he asked me *?*, why, in a serious tone. I think I said more things, because there is a [clip on twitter]() of him looking confused while Im talking. On my post-it note I had asked him to write down his first impression of me. He has terrible hand writing, so I had to ask a friend to help me read it. Apparently he just said Youre from Sweden hahahahaha, such a Baekho thing to just state facts! Ren wrote pretty and Aron wrote very nice.  
  
I kind of collapsed in my seat after the signing. It was a good thing I had a high number so I could take photos before going up, because I was barely functioning afterwards. On the way home I missed my stop two times and had to go back and forth.  
  
I also met a super sweet Canadian LOVE at the fansign! She took a few pictures of me, and we met up several times at other events!  
  
--- 
  
####20180713 Romantic Sunday  
  
The event place was in Gangnam. I met up with the Canadian LOVE from the fansign the day before and had lunch at a caf that was NUEST W-themed for the weekend. Both of us had gotten in to Romantic Sunday and we were so excited!  
I didnt think I would get in at first since I was broke from the fansign and could only afford a few albums. I decided to increase my odds by spending my Thursday afternoon going to Incheon, the location most far away, to buy my albums. And it worked!  
  
We arrived to the Romantic Sunday venue and took the elevator to the second floor. As the forever lost international fans, we copied the k-LOVEs and lined up. We realised that it was the line to get wristbands. We showed ID and the store lottery ticket. Then we drew numbered wristbands randomly, without seeing, from a box. Her wristband was red and mine was [yellow](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1018394006315720705). At first we didnt really know what that meant. Someone approached her to ask who her bias was. As soon as she said Baekho the k-LOVE went away. So she got Baekho, her bias! Another k-LOVE approached with a yellow wristband and asked her if she wanted to trade for JR. That meant I got JR! We both got our biases!  
  
Then we spotted two super nice k-LOVEs who we had talked to at the Friday fansign. They had also gotten in! One of them also had JR, so she told me just to follow her when we walked in. We still had no idea what exactly the wristbands meant. Were we being split up in four groups? I had a quite low number, and was pretty much shaking. If we were being split up, I would likely be front row considering my number.  
  
They finally opened the door and let us in. We were all in the same room, and our numbers were our seat numbers! I ended up middle and forth row, so I had an amazing view of the stage. And it was a lot more calming for my nerves.   
  
When we walked in, they had a big screen saying [Romantic Sunday](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1018403822677315584). However, while staff was setting up they accidentally projected Baekhos script instead of the Romantic Sunday screen. They hurried to fix it, but moments later they again accidentally showed a few questions. So they decided to just turn that screen off until they were ready to start.   
  
Romantic Sunday started and the MC for the day was introduced. MC Baekho! He walked on stage and welcomed us. He asked us how we wanted the other members to walk in and there were lots of screams: cute! sexy!. He then asked us which member we wanted. The loudest screams were for Aron, and Aron walked in and tried to be sexy. We all laughed, because it was mostly funny with a little bit sexy. Next was Ren, and he did a lot of poses while walking in and did sexy better than Aron. JR was last and he knows hes the sexiest when he dances, so he danced in.   
  
They introduced themselves and talked a bit. Then we moved on to the first segment, commentary!  Dejavu behind, and Dejavu MV. They found it so funny when we screamed and stopped the video a few times to explain something in more detail. At one point they stopped at a really amazing Aron still and we all woaaahhhed. He looked really smug at that, so cute. They stopped and commented on the goat of course, and then JR got embarrassed when we screamed when he appeared just after the goat.    
  
To stop the video they had these buttons that lit up if they were pushed. They agreed to stop the video you pushed it and said Love. Yet Ren raised his hand and said stop instead, and Baekho had to correct him. Ren also kept forgetting to light up the button again after pushing it.  
  
Third commentary was the vlive and they kept cringing at their cheesy lines and the ASMR. We laughed with them at some scenes and they also stopped to clarify a few things. At one point JR just leaned back in his chair and pretended to not see. He is cute.  
   
Next segment was questions! We and the members had to guess if a statement was true or false! Most of the time Nuble and k-LOVEs got it right (I never understood the questions in time to answer...), but there was one question only JR got right because he knew. Baekho had to explain that one.  
  
We then moved on to a game segment! There were two games. First a game where they first did rock-paper-scissors, then the winner had to point in one direction and the loser look in the other direction. If they did it right they switched and kept going until someone looked in the same direction as the other person pointed. When that happened the pointer got to grab a toy hammer to hit the loser, while the loser had to grab a pot to hold over his head and protect himself.  
  
They split up in two teams after a quick game. Baekho-JR and Aron-Ren. ARen jumped and hugged each other happily!  
  
The game started with Aron vs JR. After a few back and forth, Aron got a good hit on JR! JR rubbed his head and walked over to the outfit table. Another rule of the game was that the winning team picked an outfit item the losing team had to wear. Ren and Aron picked out a flower hat for JR and a red sequin jacket for Baekho.  
  
Baekho went to the back of the stage to remove the blue shirt he was wearing over his white tshirt and we all ohhhed. He put on the red sequin jacket and the others remarked it was fitting for the MC. Next round was Baekho vs Ren. It got intense quickly, and Baekho managed to do a save by holding the pot upside down, making Ren hit inside it. They all looked confused and Baekho had to show slowly how he held it up. The game continued and Baekho did another similar save, but managed to hit himself with the pot instead and held his head in pain. The round finally ended with Ren winning, and team JR-Baekho had to get another item each to wear. Ren picked out a red sequin bow headband for Baekho, that matched his jacket. JR got a green sequin jacket, and we started to ohhh when he had to remove his outer shirt, just to realise the white t-shirt he was wearing underneath it also was long sleeved. So typical JR! 

Next round! JR vs Aron. Baekho cheated and held up the pot for JR, making them lose. JR and Aron did a slow motion hit to illustrate JRs loss, and team ARen got to pick out more clothes items for JR and Baekho to wear. Baekho got a bow tie that also matched the rest of his outfit, which Ren thought was so much fun! JR got a pair of sunflower sunglasses that they first tried to place on his hat, but then decided to let hang from his t-shirt neckline. 

Last round was Ren vs Baekho again. Before the round started they picked up an accordion that they decided the loser should have. After another intense battle team JR-Baekho lost again! Baekho picked up the accordion to play a bit and we all ooohhhed. Of course he can play the accordion.  
  
Then they moved on to the next game, number noraebang! They were given a number and had to try to score that for the noraebang. This was the battles of the singers. [Ren went first](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1018433542391357440) and [then Baekho](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1018434994979475458). I love our talented vocals. Baekho can still bring out emotions while dressed up ridiculous.  
  
They started to introduce the next part by saying they had gifts for us! Gift number one was a group photocard. Gift number two was an electromagnetic sticker in the shape of the constellations they drew earlier in a VLIVE. We would be given these randomly at the end. Then they continued to show four flowers with numbers and had to pick one each. They reminded us about our wristbands while they were picking numbers, and we held them up. Baekho picked number 1, Ren picked number 2, Aron picked number 4, and then JR made a big act by pretending to not knowing what to pick before he eventually said 3.   
  
Then NUEST W said goodbye and that theyd be back shortly. A quick break. I was so overwhelmed at this point that it probably was good for me. Meanwhile, staff started to set up tables and put up rope dividers near each table. They brought in boxes of flowers and we oohhhed, Nuble would give us flowers! We had gotten to the Romantic part of Romantic Sunday!  
  
NUEST W walked in again with flowers in their hands. They looked so good. They revealed how the numbers they had picked earlier matched a specific colour of wristband. K-LOVEs figured it out in advance, and they got it right! Baekho revealed that he was the red wristband. Next was Aron who revealed he was blue, then JR yellow (!!!) and last Ren green.   
  
They picked us by sections and directed us to walk up on stage. I was among the first groups and guided in the direction towards JR. I was completely freaking out when I reached him and forgot everything. He just looked at me with a smile and said in English: Hello Thank you Beautiful while giving me the [flower](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1018441563356028928). I melted. I think I was too overwhelmed to even thank him. I have no memory of the stage except his face and those words.  
  
I dont think he remembered me from Friday. I think the other three did though. I love JR but he has goldfish memory when it comes to people. Aron definitely remembered me. He looked straight at me on the stage and looked like he remembered. 
  
After getting the flowers we went back to our seats while the rest of the room went to get their flowers. Baekho finished first, but had one flower left. So he went up to the edge of the stage to hold it up and look around to see if anyone didnt get one. Aron finished next and went up to join Baekho. A moment later JR finished as well, while Ren still had a line. He kept talking to fans and taking his time. Eventually they all finished handing out flowers. They asked us if we wanted them to do a song, and of course we wanted that! They asked which and everyone started screaming. Look was one of the loudest screams, so Baekho asked if we didnt want to hear something from this album instead. Of course we want to! LOVEs started screaming for every song on the album! After a moment they revealed they would sing ylenoL!  
  
ylenoL was amazing. I saw everyone else filming, so I decided to just enjoy it there in that moment, since I knew I could find it online later with this many cameras and phones. I love Nuble and it was amazing hearing ylenoL live!!! After half the song they walked off the stage and went up the aisles! I was third seat in, so I could see them so well, but I was too far away for a high five. First Aron walked past, then Ren came by, and last JR walked up my aisle. Towards the end of the song they returned to the stage, and after the song was over they thanked us and said goodbye.  
  
We all waved as they left and then I pretty much collapsed in my seat. People remained seated, as staff walked up to give us the photocard and electromagnetic sticker, as well as to cut our wristbands. Fortunately, they gave us back the wristbands after cutting them. I got Rens electromagnetic sticker and its so cute!! Its the one saying LOVE W, awww!  
  
I met up with my friend again, and the k-LOVEs from earlier found us while we were standing and talking and trying to recover. We ended out going to dinner together afterwards, even though our Korean isnt that good and their English wasnt either, but they were seriously the sweetest! We communicated over the little Korean/English we knew and translator apps. I love LOVEs. Before we said goodbye we promised each other forever LOVE and NUEST, just like how the flowers we were given symbolised eternal love.

####20180721 Baekho Birthday Busking  
  
At this point promotions were technically over. But Baekho wanted to do something for his birthday, similar to JRs birthday ad tour in the squirtle costume.   
  
I was at a Minhyun exhibition together with the American LOVE I met during the box tour. The exhibition was in a weird location, far from everything. We had planned to take the metro back to Gangnam after the exhibition, to go to a few Baekho cafs and maybe also the CGV cinema that had his ad. However, as we are about to leave, Pledis posts about Baekhos Birthday Busking in Olympic Park at 6pm. It was 1pm. We were quite far from regular Seoul, but so is Olympic Park, and it would only take us 20min to go there from where we were. We looked at each other and decided instantly to go.   
    
As we got to Olympic Park, other fans had also started to arrive. We managed to get seats at the [4th row on the right side](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1020641556909309953) looking at the stage. We first sat down, but this was one of those heat wave warning days, and we were miserable. We noticed that some k-LOVEs simply wrote their names and phone numbers on a sheet of paper that they taped to the seat. Then they left. So I hurried to the closest CU to get paper, tape, and a blanket to sit on. Some k-LOVEs approached us to ask if they could use our papers, pens, and tape too, and I happily shared with them before we left to find shelter. I later found out that they left some candy for us as thanks, but it [did not do well in the heat](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1020644154764767232)
  
After some time in the AC at a caf, Pledis posted that everyone had to be there by 4:30pm, or they would give the seats to other fans waiting. So we finished our drinks and hurried back. I was also texting with the super sweet k-LOVEs from Romantic Sunday, and offered them to sit with us, and they were so grateful.
  
There was still a long wait under the sun, but when Baekho finally got there it was worth it. He did various covers, and also NUEST songs. Someone requested Sleeptalking at one point, and he said he couldnt do it, as it is a song that should be performed by five people. OT5 forever! My favourite was when he sang Happy Birthday, his solo from Action, and got the crowd to sing along. [Na Yull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ_HmDAwv8M), one of the best NUEST fancammers, was sitting next to me, so there is a video of the entire concert from my exact view.  
  
After the concert I was overwhelmed by both hype and heat. I met up with the Canadian LOVE who had arrived too late to join us, and went out to get dinner together. I was a mess. Such a good day.

Okay, there it is! You know what to do listen to one or all seven songs on Jukebox, and afterwards leave your review as a reply below! You can say whatever you want about the song  liked it? Say it! Disliked it? You're free to express that too! Any opinion on a song is welcome  just remember you're reviewing and criticizing the song, not the artist. If a song has an MV tag in front of it, that means the song is also up for an MV review as well, but that's totally optional and up to you!

1199,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-8-13,2018,8,13,7,96szu3,self.kpop,Are Blackpink and Twice the female versions of BTS and EXO?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/96szu3/are_blackpink_and_twice_the_female_versions_of/,Gordra15,1534113192,"Okay, I want to preface something before starting this post; I love all four of these groups. While I may have an opinion throughout, I'm not hating on any of the groups, they're all incredible feats. Now, onto my discussion;

Are Blackpink and Twice the female versions of BTS and EXO? Blackpink being BTS, and Twice being EXO. Blackpink is a smaller girl group who are absolutely blowing up on social media and YouTube views and have a huge international fanbase, and are still fairly fresh (in comparison to their ""competition"" Twice) to the world of K-Pop. Twice is a larger group of girls, and the best selling K-Pop girl group of all-time (they recently passed Girls' Generation and yes I am also surprised) and they're wildly popular in their home country and its neighbors, but not as big in America. Replace ""Blackpink"" with BTS and ""Twice"" with EXO, and it seems similar.

BTS is hilariously popular in the US, and all around the world, and are incredibly successful in terms of accolades and achievements; no other K-Pop group can touch them in the sense of physical winnings. That being said, EXO seems to hold more ""power"" in the Asian countries and have sold more albums and sell out concerts faster in those areas. EXO never seemed to grasp this same popularity in America. It's there, but it's relatively normal in comparison to most K-Pop groups. BTS blows them out of the water, by FAR, in this. They're the only group to tour in the US (fact check me, I could be mistaken) and be successful. 

Same with the other groups in question. Blackpink seems to be holding enough of a grasp on social media, and just look at their YouTube MV views. Yes, TT is the most viewed K-Pop girl group music video (385M as of writing this), and it was released in Oct. 2016. Blackpink has ""As If It's Your Last"" AND ""Boombayah"" over 350M (365M and 358M, respectively), and the former of those two was released 8 months after TT. Not to mention ""DDU-DU-DDU-DU"" which has accumulated 272M views in 2 months (What is Love? broke some records for views in a short amount of time, for comparison, and it's sitting at 175M after 4 months). Blackpink has twice (hehe) the Instagram followers, as well as the members' personal instagrams.

So I guess my question; do you agree with me, and if you do/don't, why? Why is BTS and Blackpink so virally popular and present here in America, but not in Korea/Japan/etc.?",29,0,False,self,,,,,

Hi, my name is JOJO. I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48 hours to check. good luck!",6,12,False,self,,,,,

Dreamcatcher started off super strong. You and I was so good. Their outfits were fire. I loved seeing Dami's stick trick in person. I wish they did 3 songs instead of just 2. It felt so short. 

Chungha was such a queen. She's seriously so pretty in person. Her dress was amazing. I wish she performed Rollercoaster in front of my side of the stage but it's okay. Still awesome. 

Fromis_9 stole my heart. DKDK was so good. I'm glad they got to do 3 songs. Their outfits were so cute. Their random play dance with Chungha was great too.

SEVENTEEN was of course amazing. So awesome seeing their super sharp choreo in person. Their entire segment was entertaining af. 

As an aside, I'm amazed at the people who bring big ass DSLRs to take pictures. It was funny seeing how secretive they were trying to be lol. 

I'm so glad I decided to go to both days of KCONLA. Money well spent. Hopefully the line up is just as good next year so I come back lol. ",76,120,False,self,,,,,

Sejeong (Gugudan) released Flower Road to great praise. If Gugudan's numbers don't improve, we might see Sejeong go her own way and it is fairly obvious she has generated enough fans for her solo career to be successful. 

Wheein (Mamamoo). While her band-members have struggled more, Wheein has been very successful with her solo recording with her collaboration with Jung Key, Anymore, topping the charts. 

Ros (Blackpink). Ros stands out in her group, her nasal voice is distinct and unusual, and she proved in King of Masked Singer she is able to convey emotion through her prescient vibrato. ",33,9,False,self,,,,,

Today I finally finished the first round of mathematics over the subject and managed to calculate some predictions for the most viewed videos.

At the present rate, only two videos (other than Gangman Style and Gentleman) should get past the 1 billion views: in a **little less than 5 years**, Blackpink's Ddu-du Ddu-du should breach that number, and BTS' DNA should get even higher close to 1.1 billion views in that time, reaching 1 billion in 39 months.

These numbers come from the statistical analyses of over 2000 videos, particularly 900 videos that are the top viewed videos for each of the past 60 months (15 per month).

[The viewership curve, as well other data, can be seen at this link](http://www.aoimirai.net/kpop/research.html), which also come with a prediction tool to get how many views other videos will reach (the system is capped at 60 months)

Since the math on top of a single prediction is a little heavy, I am still working on creating the complete Kpop MV list adjusted per age. The current tool can estimate both future and past, meaning you can check how many views a video it *should* have in the past (it even calculates how many views it probably had on the first month). It is statistics and there are a lot of noise (as you can see on the graphic at the site), but it actually works.

If you plot the data and generate a formula for how many views a video have at a given month, the formula is as follows:

V = FM * 73.8 ( M + 0.68 ) ^ -0.796

*(no kidding)*

Were FM is the number of views at the first month, M is the desired month and V the number of views for that month.

By adding or removing the views for each month, you can reach totals for every month in the timeline of a video.

Back to the most viewed videos:

**BTS's DNA** will take #1 for Group videos, reaching 1.07b views in 49 months. The 1 billion views should be reached in 39 months, 900m in 28 months, 800m in 19 months, 700m in a year and 600m in 6 months.

**Blackpink's Ddu-du Ddu-du** will take second for group videos, reaching 1b views at it's 5 year anniversary (in 58 months). 900m in 41 months, 800m in 28 months, 700m in 18 months, 600m in 11 months, 500m in 6 months and 400m in a little over 2 months.

Just for comparison, **Twice's TT** should still be the first group video to hit 400m in a little over a month, but should stop around 600m. **BTS's Fake Love** will reach around 700m in 5 years.

There are better mathematical models to predict these views, but I used a simpler exponential formula. You should also consider that every time a group performas a comeback, every video receives a little boost, so all the above times should be reduce a little for each comeback. Just as an example, Blackpink's hit added almost 50 million **extra** views on all their MV's in the last 2 months.

Once I get around the extensive math to create the adjusted-by-age MV viewership I will drop a note ;)",6,0,False,self,,,,,

I would like to know who guys think will win Rookie of the year, AROTY(Artist of the year), ALOTY(Album), SOTY(Song) this award show season? (MAMA, Melon, ...)

For me personally (Till now!!):

ROOKIE: **(G)-IDLE**. Why? They really are **monster rookies**. With their new release they charted on all 6 kcharts with a #1(still) on bugs and more importantly melon #8(now top15).They had huge succes with their hit debut song ""Latata"" too. They have over 20K+ sales. They are defenitly getting this as I believe no rookie will surpass this impact. 

AROTY: **BTS**. Their impact was insane this year from being congratulated by the South Korean president to their millions of albums sold to their impressive new achievements and impact on the Korean economy. Well known songs like their hit song Spring Day, DNA, Fake Love are all still charting in the top30 during day.

ALOTY: **Wanna One**. Wanna one had an incredible year this year. Their albums sold all counted with millions too and their Korean fanbase is no joke. I would say a very well deserved award. Maybe MAMA will even give them AROTY. 

SOTY: **Momoland** - Bboom Bboom. The impact this song had is no joke. You could hear this song in every street in Korea and climbed up the charts to their well deserved place after all the buzz around it. If it's not Bboom Bboom it will be 'What is Love' or 'Love Scenario'. MAMA and YG still have that thing going on? So doubt they will get it for MAMA but maybe Melon if they were to win it?

What about you? Please discuss maturely, be nice in the comments and respect each others opinions.

These two days I've been compiling a list of websites and prices for the new Loona + + album and it just occurred to me that it would be really to handy to have this kind of thing for not just Loona but all kpop groups and for any kpop merch in general. I was getting tired of needing to open up 10 tabs with different websites to compare the price so I thought I might as well organize it into a list somewhere. 


I actually just finished building a pc with the guide of r/buildapcsales and it was so amazing having a community that was collectively putting together deals and generously sharing them with strangers. What if r/kpopsales could become something as amazing as that and help out so many people? Maybe this would be a lot of work to moderate/start but I think it could become an incredibly useful resource. And maybe it's still a dream but I thought I'd put this out there and see what you all think about it. 


Also, I realize that /r/kpopforsale is already out there but it seems that it's really a resource for third party sales and not sales that come directly from websites.

So if you kept up with LOONA on this subreddit or on /r/LOONA you might recognize me/my username but if not, all you really need to know is that I am a huge girl group stan but ESPECIALLY a huge LOONA stan. 

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory. I honestly have /r/kpop to thank for introducing me to this amazing group. Ever since the pre-debut project was announced in an article posted here, I was intrigued. I didn't officially start stanning LOONA until HaSeul's release (her voice is amazing) but I did checkout Heejin and Hyunjin's solos afterward. Ever since [HaSeul called out to the seal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o7Kb6L7T_Q) I was absolutely hooked and I picked her as a bias.. And thus began my journey with LOONA. I remember how hard it was streaming [Everyday I Love You to 300,000 views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNcBZM5SvbY) in order to unlock Everyday I Need You and JinSoul's reveal. I was there for the initial reveal of Kim Lip and how she completely transcended LOONA and what they could be compared to LOONA 1/3. I of course fell in love with JinSoul during SITR and she immediately became my ultimate bias. I was extremely supportive of OEC throughout their promotions, even buying their albums when I went to visit Seoul last year. With the next group of Eden girls, each one was just as amazing as all the others. Chuu attacked my heart and became one of my biases as well. I was always so hyped about each new member I would add them to a [hype train photo](https://i.imgur.com/eagZvLz.jpg). With Olivia Hye's reveal the hype train was completed and LOONA was set as OT12. I've never been as invested or supportive of K-Pop group as I am with LOONA.

I know this is all background story for me but I think it's important. And the reason is that I don't have any friends in real life that like K-Pop or LOONA. The only place I get to share my love, my excitement, my hype was with you all here at /r/kpop. And for that I am really grateful. Which in turn has inspired me to do a giveaway as a way of giving back to this community =] I waited until OT12 would debut to do a giveaway and now that day has finally arrived! The girls deserve full support and I am doing my best to help them achieve success. If you have read this far, see below for all the information regarding the giveaway. 

#####Giveaway Information

[Here's proof of my order/purchase from Music Plaza LA](https://i.imgur.com/BW6PLmE.png)

I purchased 8 total albums, 2 of each version. I plan to keep 1 each of the Limited Editions (A &amp; B) and the 4 posters. I will be giving away the remaining 6 albums (1 Limited A, 1 Limited B, 2 Regular A, 2 Regular B). There are some rules/requirements I have that you would need to agree to before participating in the giveaway:

* **YOU MUST BE OKAY WITH UNSEALED ALBUMS.** Since it doesn't seem like the odds are really in my favor to get any of my biases (JinSoul, Chuu, HaSeul) photocards, I want to at least check all of the albums to see if I find them. If I do, then I will exchange it with the limited edition unit photocards. If my biases are nowhere to be found, then I will leave everything as they were when I originally got them. 

* **YOU MUST BE PATIENT AND WILLING TO WAIT** So based on the above as you can tell, I am getting the albums shipped to me first. The reason I am doing the giveaway now is so that I have the winners info all ready to go so I can ship right away once I get the albums. I will be shipping from Texas, USA. **The giveaway is open internationally**

* **YOU MUST BE ACTIVE ON REDDIT.** Specifically this sub or /r/LOONA. Mainly doing this as a way to weed out people creating extra accounts or people not from Reddit attempting to join the giveaway. If you are a lurker, it's okay since I will be looking at the age of the accounts. 

* **YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE &amp; COOPERATIVE.** If you are chosen as a winner, you would need to be able to communicate with me to get all the shipping information and what not figured out in order to get you the album as fast as possible. Since it is open internationally, you will definitely need to work with me if you are outside the USA. 

If you read through the rules/requirements are still down to participate in the giveaway then do the following: 

* **LEAVE A COMMENT ABOUT LOONA ON THIS POST.** This is completely open-ended. Post your biases, your favorite sub-units, your favorite songs, memes, gfys, pictures, inside jokes, share your backstory with LOONA like I did, etc. Whatever your heart desires when it comes to LOONA. 

I will be picking 6 comments as the winners of the giveaway. The criteria to be chosen is vague but the main thing I am looking for is to find winners who share the love and enthusiasm for LOONA that I do. People that will appreciate getting the album the most.

I think that about sums everything up so if you want to participate, comment away! If you have any questions feel free to PM me. And always remember: **Stan LOONA, Stan Talent**. ",138,160,False,self,,,,,

[Pricing documented here](https://twitter.com/BamBdm1A/status/1030256356979339265). P1 at $400 was the highest pricing with an engagement chance for one artist, and P4 was the lowest at $100 for GA back of venue. Not many other differences between P2 and P3. There were slight discounts for early bird ticket purchases, but no real event info released yet.

Once people started calling them out on their ridiculous pricing [they began buying comments which came in all at once](https://twitter.com/FxxkAgustD/status/1030237753693233153). Accounts with barely any posts much less any kpop posts, following thousands, all rushed in to comment about being ""so ready"", ""A.C.E. sold for $1000"", ""ASTRO sold out NYC quick last time"", and so on.

Once they got called out for that, within the hour they deleted the entire post. Their website still has no info on event details or pricing.

No official article posted yet, but I'm sure AsianJunkie will have something eventually and I'll edit the link in.

Wanted to share this info early, to let people know how this went down before they make another pricing post. High prices for 3 rookie groups and 1 member of a group is one thing, but buying comments to try and trick fans into gunning for early bird tickets is another level of shady. ",29,151,False,self,,,,,

Whether you believe there was manipulation or not, I feel the result begs the question, do ends justify the means? His song is great and the placing on the longer lasting charts prove this. I believe there are many other great songs and artists in Korea, but the current industry framework really stifles opportunities for them. 

I don't think this issue of small artists struggling to get exposure is necessarily different in other countries, but specifically in Korea, the marketing power and avenues for exposure are staggeringly limited because of how vertical and dominated  the marketing/promotion space is by select players. Even B level idols suffer from this imbalance and have no chance to really compete with the powerhouses. What chance would a small or indie label have in this situation?

The old addage of ""there's no such thing as bad publicity"" comes to mind even though most of the time bad publicity has bad results for artists. However, for artists who most likely will be overlooked, I'm not saying they should do something outright illegal, but if they leverage the system that is in place to their advantage, can we blame them for trying just so they can get a shot?

Mods, please adjust flair if it's not fitting.

The song is HUGE here. At the very least in Saigon. I dare you to walk around the city and not encounter the song at least once every 10 minutes.

I've linked an image album with play counts from Zing MP3, Vietnam's biggest music streaming website along with a couple other songs for you guys to compare: [ZING PLAY COUNT](https://imgur.com/a/kWLjFmo)

It's currently at 27M play count compared to BTS's massively successful Fake Love at 13M.

Twice's biggest song here, TT, can't hold a candle at 6M and their latest song, DTNA, is at a measly 1.7M.

Opinion on why: The song is VERY coffee shop friendly. And Vietnam is a very coffee shop friendly country. To say that coffee shop is a big deal here is a massive understatement. People live in coffee shops, people get work done, kids do their homework, business meetings, dates, hangouts, all of life's activities revolves around coffee shops here. It's not uncommon for a block to have 5 to 10 coffee shops. To be a successful artist in Vietnam is to be coffee shop viral and this song is getting MASSIVE airtime in coffee shops, gyms, supermarkets, convenience stores consistently within the past month.

I am aware of the controversy behind it and is just giving a different perspective. I highly doubt anyone is expending that much resources to manipulate charts in Vietnam.",28,45,False,self,,,,,

Me and my girlfriend will be visiting Korea. From 22. August we will be staying in Seoul and would like to have a great k-pop experience on the weekend (24./25./26. August). We tried to get tickets for the upcomming BTS concert but unfortunatelly they were sold out. Both of us don't listen to k-pop and we don't know any groups besides BTS. The most important thing for us is that the concert (or club?) is very k-pop-ish and that we are not the only guests. Do you have any recommendations where we can go or where to book the tickets? It can be anything:

* some unfamous/famous group
* male/female groups
* normal concert
* underground gigs (if that exists?)
* act in a club or bar? As long as its typically k-pop-ish. Preferably with Korean people, not a touristy concert with Europeans/Americans. Is there a site where i can browse all upcomming (and available) k-pop acts in seoul (not just the famous one)?

We will stay in Busan from 30. August until 3. September, so busan would be an option aswell.

Thank you in advance!",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I dont know how to start this discussion so I'll just introduce myself and explain why I want to talk about this subject.   
I am a 19yo guy dating an 18yo girl. It's been a few months now and those were the best times of my life, I've always did my best to take interrest in what she loves, she introduced me to animes, mangas and video games she loves, she's a huge weeb and it hasn't been a problem for me because of how diverse our center of interrests are, we have so much to talk about and to discover.  
However, she recently started getting into Kpop after I introduced her to the genre. Dont get me wrong, I love Kpop, I listen to it a lot and even sometimes join Kpop discussions groups etc. But ever since I introduced her to the genre, I started to regret it. At first it was kinda cute, she'd be super happy to remember the BTS' members names, she was listenning to a lot of their music and we would talk about it for hours, I was really happy because I love Kpop myself.  
But it starts to become quite bothering now. I know I may sound insecure or jealous, but her love for Korean Idols made her idolize korean people in general. She just keeps talking about her bias is so cute, so precious and so beautiful. I wouldnt mind at first, I mean we all had at least one celebrity crush, but recently it really started to piss me off. She has thousands of her bias photos, she always talks about him, she literally watches 30min-1hour long videos of this guy's reactions to every little thing that happened in his life and just seems to be obsessed with him in general, to the point where our conversations only revolves around him and his group.  
Her concept of ideal partner now revolves around ""korean cuteness"", and since I'm not asian, seeing her always talking about how asian facial features are so beautiful, how their culture is so interresting, how their food tastes so good ... and the list goes on, being asian basically means being the perfect partner for her, or at least it seems to be. So for me being unable to restart my life and chose the asian class, it sometimes makes me think that Im not enough for her.  
Maybe I'm overthinking this, but it's scary to see how much interrest she has for some guy she'll never meet, to the point where she has posters, literally thousands (yes thousands) of pictures in a folder specially made for this guy, how much she knows about him and his life. I dont know what to do really, she doesnt do anything bad, she's just really into something, but seeing her idolizing someone that much to the point where this guy alone makes her super horny and stuff. Makes me sad, and somehow jealous of someone that doesnt even know she exists.  


So I wanted to talk about this, girls and boys, hardcore and casual kpop fans, how does Kpop affects your relationships ? How would you handle this kind of situation ? Ive also seen a lot of guys in the same situation as me, and sometimes it goes even further than that, with kpop being the reason of divorces and break ups because the guy couldnt handle it, but was called jealous over nothing  (wich probably is the case, but you know...)",0,1,False,self,,,,,

1717,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-8-18,2018,8,18,14,989anr,self.kpop,"(Hyuna-E'Dawn Saga) Do international 'fans' just don't understand Korean 'fans', and vice versa? If so, are they rightful in their own convictions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/989anr/hyunaedawn_saga_do_international_fans_just_dont/,nonenameorem,1534569368,"Since Hyuna-E'Dawn 'Scandal' broke out, the major opinions of the Korean and International fans were at odds.

The disconnect were clear; in Korea the norm was to be fan of One Group Only, while the I-fans were much more into be 'fan' of variety of groups as consuming them as 'kpop'. The definition of 'being a fan' cannot be more different.

So, the Pentagon 'fans' were at shock having discovered that their group's name were now at gutters of newspapers. The public were not really favorable to the scandal, as the dating inside the same company is no-no. (Of course, if they marry it'd be celebratory ocassion. Though, in this case; the results were the Pebtagon as a team were now in the brink of shattering itself.)

On the other hand, international 'fans of kpop, and Pentagon) cannot be more jubliant. For them, it's Romeo and Juliet sans its tragic ending. It's their shippimg dream come true. (Even though, the dreams which comes true in reality turn out to be actual nightmares.) 

It's romantic saga, the villians are clear :

The Company who violate natural humans rights to manufacute those poor idol groups who cannot even date(gasp!) and be at discipline in their fan-service towards their fans(how barbaric!), 

The Korean fans who are not 'real' fans (who are so childish, ignorant that they cannot accept their idols are human(Oh, they need to be taught lessons and grown up like the rest of International fans! Those savages! No wonder Korea is still underdeveloped in their mentality. Look at us, USA Europe we are the cultural colonizers. Even if, it's called 'k-pop' it is them who don't know what is rightful action in their industrial dealings.)

The Korean idol culture is much more favorable to making a 'group'; it's durable, sane and comfortable ship which all fans board and the idols are the captains. If one of the members doesn't want to be onboard. Fine, please depart and do not harm the ship. Never. For the fandom who are still onboard.

Among K-fans, dissapointment toward E'Dawn were not at he has been dating. But more about that, 'He didn't care, at all about the Team. While we were doing our best to make Pentagon successful, he has been dating on the stage - The Stage which must be treated professional, but it were just for their flirting and sexual gratification. Thus, it was like the stab in the back. (Think about Civil War in Marvel Universe, and how the fans are extremely sensative about being loyal to the Team, it's quite simmilar)

The I-Fans are much more about the Individual. They cannot understand why the korean public is so ignorant and stupid. Can they not see how happy the couple is? They are human! They are young! Of course, they should date! Those who say he is disgrace, fuck you. Individual happiness comes first! Who cares, the Team is attacked from inside? The Princess and Prince must be merry and marry, fuck those ignorant citizens abd their Castle. The story shall end. 'They live happily ever after.'

Are these types of dual-ing 'fans' rightful in their own convictions? Do you understand each side? Just one of them, or neither? What's your thoughts on this disconnect between One-Group-Fandom and Many-Merry-Fanning?

Now, this post is not for flames. It's easy to throw torch and be giddy that it burns so well. Fire make somebody happy, I gather.

\-EXO's Chen (main vocalist)

\-Super Junior's Ryeowook (vocalist) (cushion between the other vocalists)

\-Seventeen's Woozi (Composer, vocalist)

\-BTS's Rap Monster (rapper) (would be fun to see what he and Mark come up with)

This got me wondering, for those of you who have an ult group or even just have one of your all-time favourites be nugu, what's your experience like stanning them? When you know they deserve way more recognition than they get? I'm talking about groups that are truly unknown (like most people wouldn't recognize their name, hardly any media attention) not ""underrated"" groups like Astro or The Rose.",111,102,False,self,,,,,

Also disclaimer i mainly follow girl groups so i apologise if i dont know a members name or song, I'll definetely check them out tomorrow and I'll update this post accordingly. If anyone wants to let me know the names of the songs feel free. Also if i get the ordering wrong im sorry its about 2 am that im writing this

The artists are in order

**WJSN**

I was nowhere near ready for this. Wjsn is in my top 3 bias groups and though the c-line wasn't here i was beyond excited and could feel my heart pounding out of my chest. 

They started off with **Dreams come true** into **Secret** before they moved to the front of the stage for ments. Dayoung especially dis loads of fanservice which i found really cute. 

They continued with **Starry moment** and didn't really do the choreo and did a lot of fanservice. Eunseo was running around the stage like the beagle she is. They then ended with **I Wish** which gave me goddamn chills. 

All in all eventhough the choreo was a little messy having to fill for 3 members but I've never shouted so much in my life. Side note: **Happy Birthday Bona!** 

**Jeong Sewoon**

The only song i knew from sewoon was **20 something** before this so again i apologise for not knowing the 3 tracks before that. During the first track he had some earpiece issues and he was tweaking it throughout his performance and even motioned for them to turn the volume up. He still absolutely killed his performance tho. 

After the 2nd track he did some ments and he called himself sexy sewoon which the crowd found funny considering hes known to be cute. He continued with the 3rd track and finished with **20 something** holding a fan banner

**AOA**

The sexy queens rised onto the stage with only 5 members excluding mina which puzzled a lot of us and they all had white tops but chanmi had a red fishnet top over hers and proceeded to slay **Bingle Bangle** and **Excuse Me**

They then explained that mina had gone to the hospital(I hope shes alright :() and did some ments. They continued with **Bing Bing, Like A Cat,Heart Attack and Miniskirt**

I can confirm that seolhyun in real life is 10x more fatal and chanmi was looking fly as well. But let's be honest they all look amazing

**Boyfriend**

I literally know nothing about boyfriend so again i apologise. They did really well and i really liked the rapper. I dont feel like i can fully paint the performace with my limited knowledge of them so if anyone else would like to share their perspective that would be great

**EXID**

When they came out from the curtains hyelin stumbled out which was pretty cute  and she explained later that she thought it was gonna to open differently. They started with **Lady** into **DDD**. During their ments i expected hani to talk in English considering shes pretty fluent in it but it was LE who was doing more of the english speaking. 

They continued with **Through the Night** and **Ah Yeah** Hani did ask 'are you ready' in a really sassy way tho and after the screams she was like ok, ok with a sly grin. They ended with **Hot Pink** and the legendary **Up and Down** and i swear the first flurrys of 'wi arae' was like the military was chanting it was crazy. 

Hyelin looked great with long hair and her voice pierced the goddamn heavens, shes such an underrated vocal. 

**Monsta X**

The main attraction for the majority of the crowd and not gonna lie i was surprised at myself when i could follow the lyrics of their songs. Thye started with **DRAMARAMA** and i swear I've never had my eardrums bombarded with such high decibels of screams in my life. **Beautiful** and **From Zero**was next followed by a slow song which i still cant find the name of. One of the blonde members even took a fans phone and took a selfie and like wjsns starry moment they just danced around the stage giving fanservice. 

They then did **Special** which really surprised me but its one of my favourite side tracks for their album so hey i wasnt complaining and then **Be Queit** before ending with **Jealousy**

Im pretty sure i messe up the ordering lol. 
One thing i wanna say is that jooheon made that stage his BITCH, his stage presence was insane and was hyping up the crowd like crazy. 

**FTISLAND**

Ok i take back what i said, their first track actually made me have to cover my ears not because hongki wasnt killing it but because the mix of the loud guitars plus the screams actually hurt my ears and made me dizzy for a while. Hongki was a vocal monster but at this point i was so dizzy i couldnt even tell how many songs they were singing. After i came back to my senses they did **Summer nights dream** which is a bomb if youve havent heard it yet. He hyped up the crowd with the next song getting them to stand and ended the show.

This is a really sloppy fan account but i hope some of yall appreciate it. I was bummed when twice cancelled their concert but I had an absolute blast today as well as the last k-wave and will definitely be going to the next",5,30,False,self,,,,,

[**COCOSORI 'SORI' Solo Debut Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sori_01/)

* Date Project Ends: August 24, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Sori?

Sori is soloist signed to M.O.L Entertainment. Most people know her for being originally part of the Orange Caramel vibey duo CocoSori, who debuted in 2016.

Unfortunately, success did not find the girls, and Sori eventually appeared on YG's *MixNine.* She experienced the most success (technically) while the show was running out of the female contestants as she was the only contestant to have a solo single released as a single from the show. The song ""[To Myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Ro0-3Pe5I)"" brought her decent notoriety. By the end of the show, she placed 7th in the finale.

At this time, CocoSori is on hiatus (and thought to be unofficially disbanded), so this is Sori's first official debut as a soloist.

[**SNUPER Special Repackage Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_snuper_02/)

* Date Project Ends: August 28, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is SNUPER?

SNUPER, while decently known on the sub, is still pretty nugu, so I'm going to try to flesh out their bio here.

SNUPER is a six member boy group signed to Widmay Entertainment. The group name is supposed to mean """"Higher than Super"". The group's fandom name is Swing. The group debuted in 2015 with the song ""[Shall We Dance?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB6eX7Lc2CY)"" and overall has been...doing okay in terms of sales. Not bad coming from a small label, but definitely still struggling to break out of the C-tiers.

Their last three albums have peaked at #4 on Gaon, with their highest selling album currently being *I Wanna?* with 23,616+ copies sold via Gaon. So the group's fandom is growing, slowly but surely. Their biggest issue right now is lack of recognition from the general public. All of their songs have yet to appear on the Gaon singles charts. However, the group is having more success in Japan, having their last two Japanese singles peak at #3 on the Oricon charts, selling over \~31,000+ physical CD copies of each song.

The group attempted to boost their public popularity by appearing on *The Unit.* Four members (Woosung, Sangil, Suhyun, and Sebin) auditioned with a frankly lackluster performance of GOT7's ""[Just Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCs_ITVKqtU)"". Only Sangil, Suhyun, and Sebin passed the audition rounds, and made it to the live episodes.

Unfortunately, the members did not rank very high during their stint on the show. Sangil ranked the highest at #34 while Suhyun ranked at #40 and Sebin ranked at #46. From the looks of their sales numbers, the show might have given them a minor bump in fandom power, but definitely not the kind of bump they were no doubt expecting. Sangil and Sebin's most notable performance on the show was on Team Green for the performance of 2PM's ""[Heartbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvuLSEwJ1gk)"" while Suhyun's most notable performance was part of Team Blue's performance of Block B's ""[H.E.R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC1L6Pouq70)"".

The group's most recent comeback was in April 2018 with the song ""[Dear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sJf0_7AddM)"".

The group has various SNS pages, of which can be viewed by clicking [here. ](https://kprofiles.com/snuper-members-profile/)

[**MONIKA Solo Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_monika_01/)

* Date Project Ends: August 29, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is MONIKA?

MONIKA is a singer signed to Zoo Entertainment. Prior to her solo career, Monika was best known for being a member of Badkidz. With Badkidz, Monika debuted in November 2014 with the song ""[Ear Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyYbLHXgeeM)"". Monika stayed with the group until this year, when she announced her decision to leave the group in March.

Monika's first album as a solo artist (and title song of the same name) ""[Will It Get Better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-wBAKxFtp4)"" came about soon after she left Badkidz. This seems to be her most recent comeback.

She has an active[ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdYI2Jd4-PJV2qscm2j0A_w) if you'd like to check out more of her music.

[**SPECTRUM Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_spectrum_01/)

* Date Project Ends: August 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is SPECTRUM?

SPECTRUM is a seven member boy group signed to WYNN Entertainment. The group debuted in May 2018 with the song ""[Light It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRi-UiA2-f0)"".

From looking into things, it looks like the group hasn't had a comeback since then, so this Makestar would be for their follow up to their debut song.

Since the group is pretty new, I wasn't able to find too much else about the group besides basic idol stats. Though a few interesting things to note:

* Member Hwarang was a trainee at Noga Entertainment, and was slated to debut in the (still undebuted) group LUCENTE under his name Jongchan.
* Member Dongyoon appeared on *MixNine* and placed a respectable 21st. His most notable performance was as part of team Gangnam Station Exit 10 with the song ""[Super Freak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbWxa7u98Y)"".

Unfortunately, the group was suddenly struck by tragedy when member Dongyoon unexpectedly passed away. For obvious reasons, the Makestar updates have slowed to a stop, and I assume the project rewards/comeback is going to be pushed back to give everyone in the Spectrum family time to grieve.

The group has various SNS pages (including individual member instagram pages!), of which can be viewed [here.](https://kprofiles.com/spectrum-members-profile/)

[**14U Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_14u_02/)

* Date Project Ends: September 5, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is 14U?

14U (pronounced One For You) is a 14 member boy group from BG Entertainment. The group is actually made up in two subunits (think EXO K/M), one being 14U-X (the ""masculine charisma"" subunit) and 14U-L (the ""cute friendly charms"" subunit) with 7 members in each subunit - though they are currently promoting as a whole team. The group debuted in July with the song ""[VVV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b83iEHH_UTU)"".

The group previously ran a successful Makestar for their last comeback, ""[Don't Be Pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSPGFCv4BTA)"", which was released on January 31, 2018.  Their [Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_14u/) was extremely successful, grossing 976.82% above BG Ent.'s initial goal.

[**H.B.Y (Ta-Ji-Hyuk) Unit Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hby_01/)

* Date Project Ends: September 5, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is H.B.Y Ta-Ji-Hyuk?

H.B.Y Ta-J-Hyuk is the first subunit of H.B.Y, which is a boy group signed to Rainbow Entertainment. H.B.Y stands for **H**ot **B**looded **Y**outh.

The group as a whole is currently best known for H.B.Y member Marco making it into the project group UNB (created from the *The Unit*), having placed 5th in the final episode. The group auditioned with a cover of Block B's ""[Nillili Mambo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sWtLwupMx8)"", and members Marco and Taro made it past the audition stage.

This subunit is made up of members **Ta**ro, **Ji**san, and Kyu**hyuk**. Taro also made it past the audition stage on *The Unit* but was eliminated rather quickly, having placed #52.

H.B.Y as a whole debuted in 2017 with the song ""[Vroom Vroom ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NJ_4kwUqTk)"" and from looking into things, this subunit is the first comeback from the group since their debut.

In contrast to their more hip-hop oriented songs from the main group, Ta-Ji-hyuk is a ballad focused group. The debuted a pre-release single ""[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GIkK6qk3JQ)"" on July 27, 2018.

* KARD: I really love Oh Nana and Don't Recall but I can't listen to anything else from them.

* Astro: I just feel like their ""group identity"" is kind of bleh? Like they don't really have anything that makes them stand out. 

* Wanna One. I feel like they're quite overrated especially after being formed from a rigged show but hey that's just my opinion.

* BLACKPINK: I know some people like that they come off as bad girls in their music but are cutesy or whatever off stage but for me it just seems fake, bratty and annoying. I cringe every time I listen to Lisa start off Boombayah with ""Been a bad girl, I know I am. And Im so hot I need a fan. I dont want a boy I need a man"".

I love PWF but everything else is just meh. No, BLACKPINK aren't better/more talented than the cute ggs.

In case this is your first time on Jukebox, here's a quick run-through  each week you will have the opportunity to listen to and review seven songs! Give them a listen, and then leave a review for the song! Your review can be positive or negative, praising or critical  anything you want to say about the song is a review! Alongside your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you can review both the MV and the song, but that's totally optional. Reviews are open until next Saturday at 8:00 PM PST, or whenever I post the upcoming Jukebox thread next Saturday!

I'm always fascinated by what albums stand the test of time and become Must-Listen albums. When I see these lists, I tend to make it a point to listen to everything on the list (at least once). It really gives you an interesting look at the culture and history of music. And I have discovered some of my all-time favorite albums from these types of lists.

My favorite thing about these lists is that they're not just decided on by sales or popularity, but rather impact on culture, music, and people. Many albums on these lists weren't the most popular or highest selling albums for these artists. But these are the albums that transcend time.

That got me thinking: If there were a list of Top albums/mini-albums of Kpop, what albums would these include? I'd really love the experience of listening to Kpop albums that have most impacted the people/fans and the music industry. Most of the lists I find spend too much time talking about sales, which isn't necessarily an indicator of quality.

If you were to compile a list of the albums that have had the strongest impact on you personally, what would the list include? Don't focus just on the new hotness (this is an issue I run into a lot when looking for impactful Kpop albums). Focus on the albums that have the most meaning to you. Focus on the albums that you think will still be recommended 5, 10, 20 years from now to those who want to listen to Kpop.",78,68,False,self,,,,,

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

I genuinely want to know peoples thoughts and feelings on this. 

I enjoy Korean music, language, and culture. Im a fan of many KPop groups and korean hip hop artists. 

But BTS just feels so overwhelming. Like theyre just pushing these kids so hard. And as a fan youre a part of it. (This isnt limited to BTS....but Ive noticed it a lot with them). 

Ive seen things on Jimins eating disorder (by his own speaking about his struggles with food) ....and Sugas depression (listen to any of his mix tape, he refers to it himself)  ....and Jins lack of self esteem (hes said this, and said he doesnt feel attractive). These arent speculations. 

Also, their songs like Fake Love CLEARLY point fans to them struggling with fame and self identity in the over critical eye of fans. 

What do you guys think.... dont be mean to me here. I just am curious on your opinions ^_^",12,0,False,self,,,,,

Laboum is right now participating in a festival at Odaiba (Tokyo), along with a few other korean groups as EXID, April and Kard. In one of the stages, they surprisingly announced a japanese debut is underway! It will happen at November 7th, with a four versions single including japanese versions of ""Hwi Hwi"" and ""Shooting Love"". There will be two new exclusive songs, ""Sugar Pop"" and ""Killer Killer Tune"". This is happening through major label Nippon Columbia, that has put already a link with info for the release (bottom of the page linked above). More info and pre-sales expected to come soon.

That really came out of nowhere. Well, excited anyways especially since this means one more group I love promoting in Japan, finally, after so many years. =)",5,103,False,self,,,,,

This post is not ""designed to bash artists or their fanbase"". Please don't delete this.)

For the sake of having some kind of definition we'll say anything pre-2012 is old and anything post-2012 can count as current, since the concept of generations appears to have died out after the third generation of kpop idols (at least in international fandom).

Current trends:
* I feel like the time in between comebacks keeps getting smaller and smaller, specifically for younger groups. This has to be at least in part due to over-saturation of the market meaning groups literally can't afford to be away but even as a fan it just gets exhausting after a certain point.
* I know that big comebacks still get extravagant stages but overall outdoor stages, collab stages, etc. for idols have gotten rarer and stages seem more basic from the studio's end. I wonder if this is also due to saturation and time constraints?
* Major unpopular opinion but I'm not a fan of all of the VLIVE content. I know the positives are that idols supposedly have more control over their content and when they're broadcasted, but it's all just so much nowadays and I guess I'm cynical about marketing these ""inside"" looks at idols ""real"" lives. At least reality tv shows are tv shows and aired over a certain period usually with some sort of game gimmick, but I'm leery of how VLIVE is being sold to fans and I know there was never a satisfying line in the sand before but the fact is that now there's truly no clear 'downtime' for idols.

Old trends:
* Minority opinion around here but I miss the over the top makeups on guys and girls, the Lady GaGa-esque outfits, and the shaggy crazy hair.
* I miss the bombastic synths.",6,5,False,self,,,,,

We've created a discord for plus size people, though people with all body types are welcome. We are inclusive and a safe space for all gender identities. We're looking to build a family that we can talk and share with each day. We are pro-NSFW but it is a hidden part of the server (must gain access to view) so you don't have to worry if you aren't interested =). If you have never used Discord, feel free to let me know and I can help! &lt;3

So far we have a separate role for kpoppers, but if there are enough of us we can get our own channel. It's not specifically kpop; it's a mix of everything.

I know Wonder Girls was the nations group before that, but I wasnt a fan back then. It seemed to me SM was always at the top. SNSD was clearly the top girl group until 2-3 years ago when they lost Jessica and the members are more concerned with individual activities that a group comeback/activity was happening less frequent. Even then, it took Twice until last year or even early this year to really be the top girl group. 

2ne1 and Kara was a distant 2nd and third even if the former was big internationally and the latter huge in Japan. It also doesnt help that 2ne1 releases material so infrequently. 

Im not too familiar with boy group but even when  people are saying Big Bang is the top boy group around 2011 or even the top kpop group ever. I remember super junior wasnt no slouch either. Also EXO was huge when they debuted even until now. 

So kpop fans/historians, is this unprecedented or did it happen before?",15,0,False,self,,,,,

I've listened to their recent album, 'TEEN, AGE', and 'Al1', and I only liked 3 B-sides from them. In addition, those 3 B-sides were all promoted (Our dawn is hotter than day, Change Up, and Trauma), so maybe it's something to do with the performances that make the song better?

To put it simply, people are just plain rude and idiotic in their(K-buzz's) articles. 
If the article is positive, they stay silent. If the article is neutral, they start acting extremely rude and spam ""How is this important/relevant?"". If they post an article about how a group outsold another group, they bitch about how ""They're creating fanwars"".
K-buzz has a variety of articles, and yet, people literally just focus on the ""negative"" ones, not even mentioning that K-buzz is not incitating nor creating fanwars, but rather, those idiotic people are the one's looking and straight up, begging for drama and fanwars. And whenever they're not bitching about fanwars, they're being disrespectful and rude by calling an article ""irrelevant"". They literally just want drama, ans when they get the drama they want, they start whining.

&gt; We planned to release a secondary notice containing various details for the upcoming exhibition, including several corners for fans to participate in; however, in order to bring fans an even better event, we will reevaluate the details and contents and announce a new notice as soon as possible. 

&gt; This upcoming exhibition will have the theme of the 4 seasons, and is a large-scale exhibition full of video content and interactive art installations reflecting back on 2PM's 10 years. We will do our best to ensure that everyone finds an enjoyable exhibition.

&gt; Hello. This is JYPE.

&gt; 2PM, debuting in September 2008, is welcoming its 10th anniversary this year.

&gt; We decided to hold this exhibition for 2PM members who look after each other and gave their best effort with a rookie attitude and their fans who have supported them for the past 10 years with unchanging love.

&gt; For the 10th anniversary exhibition titled ""The 10th Season"", top experts from home and abroad will record the last 10 years of 2PM into art and video installations as appropriate for the best group called 2PM.

&gt; After gathering/considering fans' opinions, we will cancel the 1st (previous) announcement of members' events altogether.

&gt; Regarding the venue capacity, it is difficult to hold events with many participants for fans along with the members so we ask for your deep understanding. We apologize once again for making the fans and the members feel anxious and disappointed.

&gt; Although not all members can celebrate their 10th anniversary with their fans, we will try our best to make this 10th anniversary exhibition memorable and loved by many people.

&gt; In 2PM's next 10 years, JYPE will do everything to make their days brighter and more beautiful.

&gt; For 2PM fans, please keep supporting and loving them in the future.

&gt; Details of the exhibition will be announced later. We will update the details with separate images via SNS and the website soon.",18,96,False,self,,,,,

We met in Yorkville at a resto-lounge that my friends father owns. She was sitting at a table with a group of Koreans and a couple Canadians, one being someone I know who works for Shawn Mendes old Vancouver agency. I joined their table just being polite and myself, when i was introduced to her i noticed that she was interested in me (not being cocky, i am just 27 now and can tell this sort of thing). I got her number not knowing who she was as i know nothing about Kpop but i could kind of tell she was somebody as she had an entourage there. We went on a date the next day to get health drinks and shop before she was going to workout. Later that night we met to drink at the same venue in Yorkville, got close at our table physically, and she told me everything about her life, career etc. We went back to my condo and hooked up, we got along well - we said our horoscopes were a good match haha. Anyways i thought id post this here for any fanboys who want to know about who idols date or whatever, only my current girlfriend and a few other guys know about this as i have a pretty small social circle now that i am a working man. Shes a cool person and actually a bit shy Id say, also she is one year younger than me but the whole time i felt like she was older, she was just wise i guess. Cheers!",3,0,False,self,,,,,

I want to makes some live arrangements of tunes I like, like for concerts or maybe make some remixes too. And well, that's what I've decided I'm going to do this year. So I started a new channel and put up a video today for it.  It's not much, just a bit of messing around on a song I like. I mostly made it to put out a video in 24 hours on my newest instrument(got it 2 days ago, you'll see it in the video). But I'd like to take a crack at making a full band arrangement of a song, like ""Idol,"" this next week, as like the first serious video for the channel. I guess I'm a bit apprehensive as to whether or not this is something fellow K-Pop fans will like. Ummm, I'll try to work on some editing ideas that make it a little less sterile for sure. Anyway, I'll stop yammering and post a link to the video here. It's just a bit of improvisation to ""New Heroes.""

Is this really how YG promotes his GGs? Im asking because it seems that everytime an article about BP is made, YG never fails to mention Twice.


Now, dont get me wrong here, this is not some fanwar type of post, but an open discussion of how YG promotes BP. Is downplaying another group really necessary? Cant he just use BPs strong points to promote them.

You know what to do! But in case you don't and it's your first time in this space and place: each week you will have the opportunity to listen to and review seven songs! Give them a listen, and then leave a review for the song! Your review can be positive or negative, praising or critical  anything you want to say about the song is a review! Alongside your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you can review both the MV and the song, but that's totally optional. Reviews are open until next Saturday at 8:00 PM PST, or whenever I post the upcoming Jukebox thread next Saturday!

I havent heard a title track YET where the volume slowly fades out. Besides it being a common stylistic choice for the producers, Im guessing they all end on one concluding note in order for groups to end their choreography in a final pose.

So yeah, Ive just never seen a title track end on a fade-out, but if that song exists I really want to see how the choreography incorporates it lol.",53,93,False,self,,,,,

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Irene was the alpha dragon which meant that she could eat dinner first and she left just enough dinner for all of us to have a small dinner. Seulgi was always hungry so she would go around and eat stuffed animals that were lying around the house on the sly because if Irene caught her she would get super angry and kick her out of the house or something. I somehow or another got roped into stealing stuffed animals from around the house to give to Seulgi and then Irene caught me and interrogated me as to what I was doing and why and then my dream ended.

Also, Oh!GG sounds similar to the Korean word Ojida () which means intelligent and flawless with no one lacking. The members helped come up with the group name in the end.

Many people aren't into k-pop because they think it is just up-beat boy/girl groups with a wave of screaming teens following behind them. But Korean music is so much more rich and nuanced! I wish they could listen to the beautiful voice of Yang Da-Il, Yoon Hyun Sang, 10cm, Cherry B etc.

Why is that ok for boygroups but not for girlgroups?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9ay6u4/dakimakurasbody_pillows_of_kpopstars_why_is_that/,ungut,1535456716,"As a core videogamer I visit gamescom in Cologne every year. It is a videogame expo in the first place, but it also has a huge merchandise area for mostly asian goodies every year. Frankly it is larger than anything else I know in that regard. And of course they also have some kpop shops there. It is one of the best chances to buy kpop merch in germany. 

Of course they offer a lot of BTS stuff, while I exclusively care for girl group goods. There is the typical stuff like posters, T-shirts etc. for both gendergroups. Nothing special. But what really puzzles me are those growing amounts of Dakimakuras (or body pillows). While it is not unusual to have anime characters on those, in the past years there have been more and more of those pillows with Kpopstars printed on them. Those kpop shops I mentioned place these pillows on the highest plate on their shops, so that everyone can see them. There were dozens of idols this year from different groups on those pillows. I even saw a few fangirls running around with them. 

However all these pillows were only about boygroup idols. I haven't seen a single Dakimakura with a girl (thats not anime) on them. Not just this year but in previous years as well. Same on different locations. On anime cons or asian festivals I also run into (smaller) kpop merch shops, but they only ever sell pillows with males.

I never cared about that so far, since I don't ever wanna buy one of them. Yet some month ago we had a controversy about body pillows with motives of Gfriend being sold. Source Music stopped producing their pillows after the heavy backlash from fans. So I thought Kpop Dakimakuras were gone for good. But it seems like this only applies to girl groups, since the demand for boygroup pillows is rising.

While I can agree that those pillows have a creepy and perverted feeling, I wonder why it is ok to sell those with male idols?

I would like to know what you guys think about this and if you have made the same observations with kpop traders in your area.",50,0,False,self,,,,,

Pandering might not be the right word, but its something I have noticed. Like the whole Teen (?) Choice awards thing where they got some random girls to pretend to be fans or have younger children sit up front in the audience (or was that on Ellen?) or some MC on the BMAs putting a huge show of putting on headphones and then showing the crowd of *screaming* girls who half of them probably werent even fans. All this happens so the people can be like they're like ""see?? they are extreeeemely popular!"" basically just for clicks. And this isnt just about BTS, I know I have seen this for other groups (like Hot Topic selling GOT7 facemasks but only having the 3 non Korean members because all they know is facemasks are suddenly popular and ""that Korean pop music is popular now"" mentality)

Red Velvet ( 2014)
Twice (2015)
Black Pink (2016)
Momoland (2016)
Exo (2012)
BTS (2013)

Are considered part of the 3rd Generation.

I just want to know, groups that debuted this year 2018 like (G)I-DLE, Stray Kids, Fromis 9
are they 4th Generation ? Or are they still 3rd.

To me their music and talent are really high for a rookie group w/c gave me an impression that this year marks a 4th Generation in Kpop.

Or is the Generation purely in the year range?

1991-2000 1st Gen H.O.T 

2001-2010 2nd Gen Big Bang, 2ne1, SnSd, Wonder Girls, 4minute etc

2011-2020 3rd Gen refer above 

2021-2030 4th Gen

What I mean is, while watching reaction videos (e.g Jennie Kim in the horror room in running man, jhope and the dog machine thing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_1o2bMDKVo ) many idols reactions seem to be excessively loud and animated, especially in situations that would usually warrant a much milder reaction (or via my experiences would). I also find these reactions seem almost childlike - no cursing (which I know would be quite a few adults first reactions) or irritation after the event. 

Is this the result of the company or managers of the idols trying to make sure their reactions are PG13 and 'positive' for their fans? Or pushing them to have a cute image/show aegyo to endear viewers? Or are there cultural differences in Korea that makes it easier for them to show more emotion without judgement (e.g being called pussy etc from crying in a western country)? 

(Extra context YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THIS)
I've watched a large number of idols at amusement parks/in haunted houses, and all seem to have extremely dramatic reactions for their age from my point of view. I will admit that I've been on a fair number of amusement rides, but never once do I remember myself or anyone I know crying from haunted houses, especially ones that seemingly has as few jump scares as the running man episode with Jennie Kim (I'm not attacking her directly, just using an example I hope is well known). I know some people are naturally more tense then others/more affected by such things, and that idol life is stressful and probably keeps individuals quite tightly wound, but there is a disproportionate number of reactions such as these to neutral reactions. Is it that the companies don't bother showing these reactions as they aren't as interesting to watch? ",2,0,False,self,,,,,

And how could anyone be in \[this\]([https://imgur.com/a/9pG3DnI](https://imgur.com/a/9pG3DnI)) position without seeing a camera pointed at them? This is obviously part of a reality show, and the reactions of the girls on Instagram were a clever marketing trick to gain awareness. Laysha has fooled all of us.",26,0,False,self,,,,,

There's just this magic of watching a new group at their first awards show look so grateful to be winning and getting to stand on the same big staged their sunbaes did. So keeping that in mind, which years were the most competitive for a rookie award? I'm not talking about landslide victories like 2ne1 or Miss A or iKon, but actual competition in the Korean market. 

Imo for boy groups it was 2012 (EXO vs BAP vs Busker Busker lol) and 2015 and 2016 for girl groups (Twice vs Gfriend, IOI vs Black Pink)

I participated in the Global Audition in LA and I am just gonna share my experience. First of all, I am a 17 year old male of Asian decent. I wasn't planning on auditioning but during the convention I was walking around and was called over to the Stone Music Entertainment booth by this lady with a mic. She told me that I should audition and being myself I couldn't say no. Fast forward maybe 2-3 hours I am walking into the audition room with my paper in hand trembling. I was so nervous, immediately I was met with smiles from the 2 judges and the translator. I went in to rap initially and I think I did alright, but soon after the translator asked if I could sing or dance. I didn't know what to do, I didn't have a planned dance routine, so I just said I could sing a song. Personally I know I'm not a strong singer so I did my best and the judge motioned towards her throat and I'm assuming she was talking about how I wasn't properly supporting my singing. Afterwards they asked to take pictures of me and that was it! After my turn in the audition room they closed off the room for about 5 minutes and wouldn't let anyone else come in to audition. They told me it would be 2 months before I would hear back and I've been on edge every since. Based on what I've heard from other people who auditioned, the judges would just watch their performances and send them on their way. Any thoughts?",0,11,False,self,,,,,

It's a duet it between a male singer and at least one girl. The song was RnB. The guy was more so on the masculine street side of kpop males.
I'm not sure if the female singer appeared in the music video, I recall there being like only one male and so many females lipsyncing from one voice, almost as if the female artist wasn't as important that she never really got her own scene. If my memory serves me well, the female artist had a very short simple, and maybe even English name. 

I got the impression that these artists were American Koreans by the way they were singing (the guy may have been rapping I don't remember). But the girl had a very raspy soulful voice.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

- Highest Scorer of the Week  M Countdown 1st Place
- Lowest Scorer of the Week  Temporary Hiatus
- Highest Scoring Player  Best Male Solo Artist
- League Champion  Daesung Award

etc..

Maybe we can do a $10 buy-in where the league winner can choose any 3 albums of his/her choice to be sent to them, 2nd place can choose any 1 album, 3rd can choose any 2 posters? Just throwing ideas out there lol.

If anyones interested or has any other ideas for the league just let me know. Im aiming for a 10-12 team league to hopefully draft by this Sunday at the latest. Thank you guys!
