I'm not asking for any money for it, but I'd request that you only post if you live in the continential U.S. Otherwise, it'd cost more to ship than I spent on the album, and as much as I'd love to give everyone a chance, I can't really afford that.

For those who aren't into EXO, basically what people are complaining about is the fact that Baekhyun, Chanyeol, Sehun and Luhan frequently make negative/teasing remarks about Kai and Tao's skin tone. Some fans brush it off saying it's just part of their culture and they don't mean it in a hurtful way. Other fans are really upset over the fact that these EXO members continue to make remarks even when Kai and Tao have expressed insecurity with their skin tones and look uncomfortable when it is mentioned on camera. 

I find the issue really interesting because there are so many mixed opinions on the matter. I was wondering what Reddit thinks of this heated issue?",60,43,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to post this because like Busker Busker, Akdong Musician's music shouldn't easily translate to a western audience (especially if you don't know the lyrics; look up the translation for ""Melted"" and you'll probably see why the siblings wanted to promote that particular song)- but I think they put a ton of emotion into their singing which makes their compositions relatable to anyone.  When YGent bothers to release things, they've been good.

I know the reaction that Chad Future receives here so I asked him to do an AMA so you guys can get to know him better and ask the questions that everyone wants to ask.

328,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2014-4-10,2014,4,10,23,22p24z,self.kpop,Hyoyeon's ex-BF Kim Jun Hyung opens up about Hyoyeon and the April Fools' Day incident,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/22p24z/hyoyeons_exbf_kim_jun_hyung_opens_up_about/,quirt,1397140816,"&gt; Girls' Generation's Hyoyeon found herself surrounded by quite a bit of rumors when it was reported on April Fools' Day that she had been reported to the police by a man for violence, who later turned out to be her former boyfriend. Her ex has now spoken up to clarify some matters regarding the two's relationship as well as what happened on April Fools' Day.

&gt; Her ex-boyfriend Kim Jun Hyung (35) is a CEO of a global marketing brand as well as a writer. He is known and respected as a young entrepreneur and also serves as a mentor for teens going through a rebellious stage.

&gt; So for those who know him, it was very surprising that he would be in the headlines for reporting his girlfriend to the police over a silly prank. 

&gt; Kim Jun Hyung told Star Today through an exclusive interview, *""I received over 1000 messages on KaKaoTalk... I learned how scary the power of the media can be.""*

&gt; Although he considered for a while whether he should hold this interview, he finally decided that he needed to, for not only himself, but for the sake of Hyoyeon as well. *""I wanted to tell those out there who have become disappointed in Hyoyeon through this incident what an awesome person she is.""*

&gt; When asked to explain about what happened that night of the incident, Kim Jun Hyung responded, ***""I was scared that Hyoyeon might fall down if she lost her footing. The drop was 5 meters, I was really scared. I thought that even if it's a joke, she could still seriously get hurt or that something could go wrong. So that's why I thought that I needed to get help from the police. I had called in to ask for help, but it was misreported as me reporting her for violence.""***

&gt; As mentioned in the previous articles, Hyoyeon was playing a joke pretending that she was going to jump and when Kim Jun Hyung tried to stop her, she accidentally hit him. This was the explanation that the police and SM Entertainment both offered, but netizens weren't so sure that's how it unfolded. And soon, rumors of Hyoyeon being a bully or being bullied and Hyoyeon attempting suicide started to spread. 

&gt; *""They were rumors that I just could not understand... If you knew Hyoyeon's real personality, those rumors could never have come about... If I were to sum it up, I'd say that people's imaginations were running wild. Hyoyeon is actually very nice and an atmosphere-maker with a great personality. She is also very close with her members like they are her family. She is someone who smiles all the time as she spends happy times with her parents, sibling, and dog. She is the type to not even focus her attention on rumors like that and just brush them off. Everytime she'd be misunderstood, she'd be the type to say 'I just have to do better, I just have to work harder, I just have to show a good image,'""* Kim Jun Hyung said.

&gt; Kim Jun Hyung and Hyoyeon got to know each other on December 31, 2012 at a gathering and eventually became a couple. Although they have a 10-year age gap, the two were able to bond over the fact that they are both Christian and love sports. They enjoyed dates doing various activities like skiing, hiking, golf, and more.

&gt; They would separate and get back together a few times during the course of their past relationship like any other couple. And for those who wondered whether if it was because of April Fools' Day incident that the two broke up, Kim Jun Hyung clarified, ***""We did not break up because of the April Fools' Day incident... We had decided to just remain as good oppa-dongseng before that. We would just have a meal and such with acquaintances.""***

&gt; He further said regarding Hyoyeon, *""She is one of the nicest, most honest, and most positive person I've met... We still keep in touch and ask how each other are doing and cheer each other on.""*

&gt; So with all this said, hopefully the rumors and speculations about Hyoyeon, Kim Jun Hyung, and their relationship will cease and allow the two to move on forward.

I don't mean to create a falsely sensational title or whatever, but I'm a bit shocked a little worried after seeing this photo of YoonA. She **does** look unnaturally skinny. Her legs look really unhealthy and her arms look like they have absolutely no flesh to them.

I wish I could argue that the camera angle just makes her look that way but honestly it's a direct shot. But anyways I'm reading SONEs saying that YoonA has always been skinny and I'm actually kind of aware of that, but I didn't know she was **this** skinny. 

Unfortunately it really does look like a problem, even if she's been this way for a while. I thought Sooyoung was the worrisome member too.",16,0,False,self,,,,,

As I mentioned yesterday on the thread about EXO's Comeback Showcase, I got insanely lucky and won a ticket! A fair few people asked me to post about it so here goes, hope I'm not breaking any rules.
 To win you had to download Samsungs music app, get a verified account and apply through that. Quite a pain but worth it in the end I guess! When I applied I didn't get any confirmation screen unlike everyone else, so I was pretty pessimistic about my chances of getting in.

Of course I was wrong and by some miracle got a ticket! Not only a ticket but a great one, standing section A, that's front left! If I had my act together I yesterday I could have been front row but I made the bad decision to take a taxi to Jamsil which took even longer than the subway and cost 20 times as much. I got there just half an hour before showtime and was kinda freaking out afraid I'd miss it. When I got there though, it was clear there was no need to worry. Hundreds of people were still waiting to exchange their SMS tickets for wristbands. 

I got my wristband and made it inside. It was so exciting and nerve-wracking. I moved as far forward in my section as I dared, close but not crush-close. They played a bunch of Black Keys Samsung ads on the screens before a few EXO songs (incl. my favourite Baby Don't Cry!) over the sound system. Then it got dark and people got crazy. An announcer came out and introduced Suho and he came out to accept a watch or something from Samsung (??). That's when the screaming and wild pushing began. The first 20 minutes of it was pure savagery. Security screaming at people to move back and not push. One security guy came into our section yelling and looking like he was about to rip the face off any fangirl who didn't listen. 

After the guys had done a few songs they came out to chat and introduce themselves and they all expressed concern about the pushing, especially since there were a lot of pyrotechnics there at the front. My position was pretty tame though (thanks for your concern, internet strangers!). A little pushing and place jostling, fanlights to the head, zoom lenses to the head and having my view intermittently blocked by some weird girl holding a slogan for her friend so neither she herself nor the people behind her could see. We asked her like 15 times to put it down and WHY! but she didn't listen. 

I'm sure you all have seen the video/stream by now so I won't go into much detail about the show itself but suffice it to say that it was amazing! All the hits I wanted to see, the nice little chat and of course the Overdose video premiere and first performance were all incredible! Cute things I saw that may not have made it on camera were Chanyeol pretending to chug a bottle of soju/wine when they were talking about the new single (he is such an adorable clown!) and him and Sehun dancing and playing with each other during Joah Joah. 
I feel so bad for the guys about the diamond formation they have to do at the beginning of Overdose. Must be super hard on them and it seems kind of dangerous. They were all visibly exhausted at the end of it. They need to change the choreo a little for a live stage too. If there's no camera going through the leg diamond it's just Sehun dancing to the side of them while they awkwardly dismantle. 

So that was my experience, sorry for the wall of text! I only got that one really decent pic of the boys (nearest to me lol) and [these others](http://imgur.com/a/LC4G1) of the venue and girls begging some maintenance guy for a promotional flag.

You all helped me to make a great book.,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/23ef23/im_back_do_you_want_to_learn_korean_you_all/,gobillykorean,1397866736,"Hey K-pop fans! This is Billy from [GO! Billy Korean on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/gobillykorean). I'm that white guy who teaches Korean. Back in February I asked for your help to crowd-fund my first Korean book, and now it's finally available. Thanks to a lot of your help, I was able to afford to add in a lot of extra material, as well as more than double the amount of artwork in the book; it really turned out better than I could've hoped.

Today I posted a [video trailer](http://youtu.be/-xg_qMa-6KA) for the book on YouTube (I thought it'd be a fun idea to make a video trailer) that covers some basic information about the book.

For the TLDW version, the book teaches the Korean alphabet (Hangul) + complete sound change rules, how to get started studying Korean, has practice sections in every chapter, covers 1,000+ vocabulary words and phrases, plus has advanced notes and culture notes in every chapter, and more.

You can check out the book either through [my web site](http://www.gobillykorean.com/p/learn-korean-with-korean-made-simple.html) or directly on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Korean-Made-Simple-beginners-learning/dp/1497445825/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397096272&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=korean+made+simple), among others.

Although this book won't make you fluent in Korean, it will serve as a strong first step into the language. Knowing Korean has helped me a lot, both in work and in my personal life. Of course, I can also enjoy Korean music and TV shows/dramas without subtitles, which is an added bonus. Often times, things are lost in translation, including hidden meanings or nuances in words, and the only people who can understand them are those who know Korean. If you're not studying Korean already, I'd highly recommend starting.

I'm also happy to answer questions about anything, including Korean questions. I'd love if more people became interested in this awesome language.",50,70,False,self,,,,,

I've compiled a list of K-pop fashion/dress up games for your enjoyment. I know that the intended demographic for games like these doesn't quite align with the general demographic of this sub, but hopefully people can at least appreciate that these exist/ enjoy some cute art. I think they're just too cool to not share.

(IMO - Unpopular opinion),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/243miw/kpop_becoming_mainstream_in_the_west_imo/,Bleedinghero3,1398601744,"Even though we have seen glimpses of K-pop influence western media/charts, like [Wonder girls - nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA7fdSkp8ds) and [Psy - gangnam style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0) I still think K-pop will never become mainstream in the west. Me thinking this isn't influenced based on my opinion, as I don't really care if it does become mainstream, but personal experience and observations.

For example, when Girls' Generation appeared on the David Letterman Show, even though that was an impressive achievement, nothing really happened afterwards, correct me if I'm wrong but it seems they just got a plane back and done. Also there seems to be a huge language barrier, I'm not saying k-pop artists should sing/talk more in English, we all know what happens when some do * cough * [Yong-hwa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsvQZTI_XC0) * cough * but seriously because of this barrier a lot of people will not even bother giving k-pop a chance because of a lack of understanding. 

I also think if k-pop does eventually become mainstream in the west, contrary to popular belief I don't think it will ruin k-pop as quality songs will still be released nonetheless.

This is my honest opinion as of now, however, I want to hear what you guys have to say about this topic.",19,0,False,self,,,,,

I have been in Seoul for 2 months but haven't got the chance to go to k-pop concerts, because it's almost impossible for me to try to buy tickets via this Gmarket and Interpark sites. Firstly, I can't use my credit card for purchasing and secondly, they need me to provide my Korean number, which I have, but is not available for using during internet registration. 

So the saddest thing is, I really wanted to buy 2NE1 AON Seoul ticket, which was happening 2 days after I would come to Seoul, but had no luck whatsoever. Couldn't even buy re-sold tickets from Japanese auctioneers. This made my sadder than I had ever imagined.
So now YG family concert is coming up. I'm not only a Blackjack, but I love all of YG's artists. This is the thing I'm looking forward to most of all, during my stay in Korea. 

If I'm not able to go to that concert, I don't know what I'll do. At least I'll try to get as close to the arena as possible, just to get the glimpse of what YG family might be performing :s

The kind of songs I'm looking for are in [this vein](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNV_PWEO_18).  I absolutely love the pacing, the intricate layers . . . and 's voice can't hurt.

Thing is, I'm already a fan of Clazziquai but I think this song is a little more intricately layered.  I'm kicking myself for not really checking out the ""underground"" scene while living in Seoul (it's pretty much bubblegum pop 24-7 unless you actively look).  But I'm looking for suggestions.

Thanks in advance!
