64,2015-9-2,2015,9,2,4,3j9ep9,Selling my kpop collection.,Dauthi,1441137153,"~~**EDIT I am going to sleep now, Just message me and I will get back to you tomorrow morning.~~


**EDIT 2 I'm wake. I will be going to the post office today at 3:30 est if anyone wants some CDs if you pay before then I can ship them today. Also I would prefer to just ship to the US shipping will be expensive for outside the US since I'd rather use boxes to help protect the item than the poly-bags and bubble wrap that most sellers in Korea use, its cheaper but also might cause some damage when shipping overseas. They really are not a good idea especially for expensive items.

**Edit 3 Since its died down with the messages, I'm going to be putting stuff on ebay tomorrow. Thanks to everyone who bought something. I'm sorry to the people outside the US. Still going to be answering messages if people send them but some stuff that is not reserved might be on ebay. Thanks again everyone.

Hello I am going to be selling almost all of my kpop CD collection(just keeping my aoa stuff). Before I put things on ebay I thought I would post on here first.

Here is a spreadsheet to the albums with prices, also everything has been opened and played once.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iHvO8JRBuWuFOzAeyKygUpwU7gK9mOdO2YVc5TfiaMs/edit?usp=sharing


**Shipping**

I am located in the United States, so I am going to use USPS for shipping.

I am going to be using 3 different types packaging depending on the item(s). 

[Bubble mailer](http://i.imgur.com/qfLmlH9.jpg) - Which I will most likely use when someone wants just 1 CD. This will be the cheapest of all the shipping options.

[A normal box](http://i.imgur.com/RhuVvx2.jpg) - Which I will use when people buy 2-3 CDs or if CD has some thickness to it like Taeyeon ver of I got a boy. I will also try to use this for more expensive CDs.

[A medium flat rate shipping box](http://i.imgur.com/NpQMYZQ.jpg) - This option will be used when the shipping cost of a normal box is greater than the cost of this shipping box which is $12.65 for any weight.


There are a few CDs which are larger than the boxes I have. So It might be a while before I'm able to sell/ship those

* Hyosung - Top Secret Special Edition

* Secret - Poison

* Sistar19 - The First Single Album - Gone Not Around Any Longer just fits in a bubble mailer Can send a picture of it in one if you want.

* Stellar - Marionette

CDs will be bubble wrapped before boxing them.

If you are buying one autographed CD or a more expensive CD like Crayon Pop - Bar bar bar and you just want one CD please choose if you want it shipped in bubble mailer or box. The box will be a little bit more expensive.

Most single CD sales will be bubble wrapped and put in a bubble mailer

**Payment**

I only accept paypal.

Message me on reddit or leave a comment will what CD(s) you want and your zip code, I will message you with the total price of CDs + shipping cost + photos of the CD(s). Then if you still want the items you will message me back with your name, address and paypal email. I will then send you a paypal invoice which you have 3 days to pay. After it has been paid I will then ship the items out within 1-3 Days and message you back with the tracking number.
If you do not message me back within 2 days with your name, address and paypal email the item will go to someone else.

If you pay before 3:30PM est I will try to ship out the package the same day.

I've already sold and shipped 2 CDs to a person on reddit and waiting for another to pay the invoice I sent them.

^Note: ^The ^respective ^weekly ^charts ^have ^slighty ^different ^cut-off ^times ^\(ichart: ^08/24-08/30, ^Melon: ^08/24-08/30, ^Gaon: ^08/23-08/29)

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of eight major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?serviceGbn=ALL&amp;termGbn=week&amp;hitYear=2015&amp;targetTime=34&amp;nationGbn=K)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",4,16

They debuted with [10  10](https://youtu.be/uF-BiiaeU68) and have been running ever since with 9 full albums across Korea and Japan, over 100 concerts, 3 solo music debuts, and 5 solo acting careers.

They wouldn't have gotten to where they are today without the hard work of the 6 members Jun.K, Nichkhun, Taecyeon, Wooyoung, Junho, Chansung, and their former member, Jay Park.

To commemorate the occasion, fans put up banners at the JYPE building that read, [""You, me, we can't break up. (Wooyoung's line from I'll Be Back) / At this point, we're already a family, so we refuse to be refused!""](https://twitter.com/2pmalways/status/639427504722210816?s=09)

343,2015-9-7,2015,9,7,3,3jvo94,Why do companies upload 1080i or horribly compressed 1080p videos onto YouTube?,Shatteringblue,1441562828,"Example:

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZwmFvB_9U

Those horrible horizontal lines are the result of it being originally in 1080i which YouTube specifically warns to not do

2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJYGddE0vHc

The quality is honestly really shitty. The full size comes out to be close to ~200MB for the entire clip, whereas the Bugs! version is approx 570MB and much better.

---

This isn't Japan or anything where you rely on selling BDs of their albums to get the MV instead of the PV...

---

If you want an example of the Bugs! ver., PM me and I'll give you the think. You can thank me later",20,5

So yesterday (Sunday 6th of Sept PST) current Lip Service members BiPa and Anna shared pictures on SNS of them with a female wearing a similar outfit. BiPa also [tweeted ""Long time no see from LSV"".](https://twitter.com/yesuri88/status/640886369372389376) She and Anna shared the same set of photos on their respective Instagram accounts as well.

BiPa's Instagram posts:

Anna's Instagram post:

[Imgur album of photos and corresponding SNS links](http://imgur.com/a/vYbfI)

The ""new member"" has also [posted on her Instagram a selfie with BiPa in the background wearing similar outfits](https://instagram.com/p/69cOIOlJBw/) and a [video of her singing along with ""Yum Yum Yum""](https://instagram.com/p/7VMdpVFJIi/)

Hopefully we'll get confirmation from Sony Music Korea with a statement or official images soon.

If you're wondering what former member Cora is up to, from her posts on her Instagram she seems to be working, but not sure if in the music industry. Her last music related post was a [quick clip of her dancing to ""Kitty Kat"" by Beyonce](https://instagram.com/p/5B2kYyAI9J/)",12,31

Other optional things you could share:

* Why you chose those songs
* A bit about the members
* Brief history of the group / notable events
* Why do you like this group?
* Fanclub name/colour?
* Any fandom in-jokes?
* Any good variety shows/diary shows/interviews/behind-the-scenes/dance rehearsals etc?
* Any live performances worthy of a particular mention?

It doesn't matter how well-known or unknown an act is - if you want to post about them, go for it!

 It's the day of and I still don't know what or who to expect tbh. I already know Mino (I'm still holding a sliver of hope for a miracle anyways) and Zico won't be attending and I've seen that Lil Boi, Sik-K, Geegooin, and Sanchez will also be there tonight. 

Pretty hyped in general for it all but man am I a little bummed I won't get to see Okey Dokey or Tough Cookie live....I am hoping they somehow do Turtle Ship, , More Than a TV Star cause those were some of my favorites from the show. And GXNZI which I presume Basick will perform?

But in any case, everyone on the lineup is quite good and can't wait to have a lot of fun tonight no matter what songs they all end up doing :-)

But on that note, does anyone know what they all performed at the SMTM concert in Seoul??

On September 4, I was considered unsuitable for active service and discharged 11 months earlier from my military duty.

For several years since I was a child, I received psychiatric treatment for my diagnosed OCD, trauma, stress, major depressive disorder and mood swings.

The symptoms of such conditions were apparent during times of stress. Despite my compliance to the medications I took in the army, I would get stuck in a constant cycle of depression and joy.

As my mental conditions worsened,my medications doses were increased which consequently resulted in more adverse effects, which forced me to sleep most of my days for several months. As a result, I left the military due to being unsuitable for active service.

For the remaining 11 months, I plan to focus on my treatment and will not be active in the entertainment scene. Thank you for understanding. See you next year.

674,2015-9-12,2015,9,12,2,3kkbtk,(NB)'The Fact' gets an exclusive interview with Seo Jisoo's 'victim',camelliaunderthemoon,1441991450,"Article: [The Fact Investigation - Seo Jisoo Controversy] What is the truth behind the dropped lawsuit of the 'Seo Jisoo' rumors?

Source: The Fact via Nate

'The Fact' sat down for an exclusive interview with the 'victim D' behind the rumors who claimed to have dated Seo Jisoo in the past. 'D' provided evidence of their relationship and Seo Jisoo's abuse through recorded files and letters/text messages exchanged. She also provided details on why the lawsuit was dropped and the various threats she received from Woollim as they told the public something different from what actually happened in court.

13. [+67, -3] A summary of what's going on:
1. Various victims involved in the case become threatened with being outed, sexual harassment, and the spreading of false information
2. The victims post the actual truth on the internet to clear their name and reveal Seo Jisoo and Woollim's lies but get fined for defamation. Woollim takes this to media play saying people were caught for spreading false information and fined and netizens believe it, calling the victims liars and psychologically ill. Seo Jisoo also cosplays as a victim saying she's getting treatment in the hospital while preparing for debut.
3. As it turns out, the victim had requested a formal trial to reveal the truth once and for all but Woollim drops the lawsuit and meets with the victim the threaten her and prohibit her from ever talking about Seo Jisoo in any interview or online.
4. In the process, the victim's identity has been revealed to the people she knows and she's currently unable to function in society while living in scrutiny and pain while Seo Jisoo prepares for her own debut.

Siwon recently put out a set of tweets in both English and Korean on twitter to explain his actions. English tweets are a paraphrasing of his Korean tweets, so I'll wait for someone with more knowledge of the Korean language to translate.

&gt; ***Other INFO to take note:***

&gt; * **I made a thread about an unintentional tracklist reveal on their live Daily DIA Afreeca stream a few days ago, but it appears that that wasn't the final version.  For this reason, I decided to delete the previous thread, so that I can create a whole new one with all the latest updates.** 

&gt; * As you may have noticed, MBK has changed the [English title of '' back to 'Somehow' from 'I Gotta Feeling'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iddnNVooXv8&amp;feature=youtu.be).  I made a mistake thinking 'Somehow' was meant to be used for their 2nd title track, but I just now realized that it was actually a literal translation of ''.  I still don't understand why they made the change to 'I Gotta Feeling' in the first place though.  

&gt; * *""DIA album has songs composed by Shinsadong Tiger, Monster Factory, YG producer BIGTONE, Hyunwoo. Seunghee/Cathy also involved in production.""* via [*@nathaniel*](https://twitter.com/n_athaniel); [***Soompi Article.***](http://www.soompi.com/2015/09/10/mbks-new-girl-group-dia-to-debut-with-full-length-studio-album/)

&gt; * Seunghee is a former 5Dolls member and is now the leader of DIA.  

&gt; * DIA () translates to ""Diamond"" in Korean, and is pronounced as ""Da-ee-ah / Daiya"".  Their group name is also an English acronym for ""Do It Amazing"".

&gt; * ***Update:*** *Album release date has been pushed back to Sept. 15 00:00 AM (KST).*  *Debut showcase will continue as planned; scheduled for tomorrow at 06:20 PM (KST).*",10,26

Also I'd like to mention that this is based just off my personal experience there and I tried mostly to just enjoy the show so sorry if I forgot to add something :3

**TL;DR** *I drove 17 hours from Seattle for SMTM and THE SHOW WAS AWESOME AND WELL WORTH IT. Management of the event was pretty good. Place was pretty packed. No Mino, Blacknut, Innovator even though it was advertised as Top 4 in attendance. Basick was killlllller though and enough for me (and I'm a huge Mino fan). San E. had the most stage presence imo. Sean took off his shirt for Tell Me One More Time. Paloalto had a really long set. He performed Turtle Ship!!!!! Tablo only sang 1.5 songs. Team AOMG was really cool. I loved being able to see everyone do Respect. Sanchez &amp; Verbal Jint together are amazing.*

For starters, I got there around 4pm (doors were at 7pm, show 8pm) and there were approximately ~100 people already there I would guess but it seemed like a relatively small amount. For the event, they allowed hi-touch for the first 100 P2 ticketholders which was really cool but since they moved venues and all, the ticket numbers changed and everyone was a little confused since P3 was changed to Floor 2 and nobody really clarified about that until people had already been waiting around so some people waited early and didn't even get to do hi-touch /: 

Once it was 7pm, people were escorted in pretty quickly. We had to go through metal detectors and do bag checks. I was thinking ahead of time that it would be pretty empty since it felt that way but once everyone was all in the place was pretty well packed. The whole bottom floor was mostly full and I presume the balcony was as well but I couldn't see it so I would say a total of maybe ~1,500-1,900 people? It's really just an estimate from me though but in any case, it was a good amount crowded and if you look at videos from the stage, it looks crazy. Though being back there, it definitely could have been more packed but I'm not complaining. Everyone had some breathing room. There was also some poor organization inside about giving out wristbands for upgrades on the bottom floor but that's probably venue stuff so I'll just skip talking about it.

Before the actual concert started, they played their own music lol. (Tomorrow - Tablo, You Don't Know - Loco, Joah - Jay Park, Fear - Mino, etc.) I've never been to a concert that does that but it helped build a little bit of hype and get people talking. I was discussing with a couple girls next to me and I felt bad cause I was the first one to tell her that Mino and Blacknut wouldn't be attending! Which is in itself really upsetting since they advertised that the top 4 would be there but alas... what can you do. Mino is promoting in Japan for WINNER and I'm not really sure what Blacknut or Innovator is up to.

The concert started a little late but not too much. There was a [beginning intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZR70o_ddUs) that was super hype and then each artist had an intro video which was dope and then there was a little clip of the contestants that was soooo fun.  

# **Here's a recap of the performances: (in order of appearance and with a fancam link if I could find them)**

**Basick**

* [GXNZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffan80gsr_M)
* [Stand Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtZO48AZec)
* [Survivor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpoOj5e7bRk)

Of course, Basick came out to open the show. He seems so nice and really chill and his performances were really good. Watching the show performances and then getting to see it live was.......incredible to say the least. He talked about how he was able to live his dream now and that these were the happiest days of his lives and I felt so happy for him!

**Jinusean**

* [Oppa's Car + Phone Number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkZtpHHpHOc)
* [A-Yo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cboIXAliI40)
* [Tell Me One More Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EUO4aSNJXY)

I'm not going to lie, I really only know their new release which was a LOOOT of fun to listen to performed but their other two performances were pretty good despite not knowing them. I didn't know Jinu was from LA either! Right after Basick, there was little in between time where they immediately played a Jinusean intro video and THEY CAME OUT WITH OPPACHA AND IT WAS SO AMAZING IT'S MY FAV I WISH THEY DID MORE OF THE SONG. Also.. Sean was built. (omg)

**Team AOMG (Jay Park, Loco, Lil Boi, David Kim, Sik-K, Geegooin, DJ Pumkin**

* [We Up There 2 (High(?)) + No More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PnVH3f4loE)
* [My](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvPT9IjvpZk)
* [Mommae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmIEbhxtD4w)
* David Kim, Geegooin, Sik-K, [Lil Boi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phei1rrgS1s) came out with their own little individual pieces, I only recognized Better Life - Sik-K
* [Respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl0Mgf0D794)
* [On It + Bo$$](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvVODGGYTA)

* [full set video (minus On It/Bo$$)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNuHo8iCw2o)

Team AOMG was really really awesome first off for just all being there. I've been a huge fan of Jay Park and Loco and I really liked Lil Boi on the show and Sik-K's new music so this was a treat. Respect was especially cool since they all got to do their own bit. Their set was really what I was expecting from all the teams: a mix of their individual songs + the songs from the show. Someone threw their panties up at Jay Park &amp; Loco lmao. Same. 

**Tablo**

* [Born Hater + Light it Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fm48y4Yf9c)
* [Eyes, Nose, Lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-IzX3MUMCQ)

He started off complaining about how team AOMG left a mess on the stage from throwing all the water and he started cleaning it up lol. He also talked about how lonely he was being abroad without Epik High. During Light it Up, he took a fan's phone and did a video, it was cute. I saw Epik High a month ago and he also did Eyes, Nose, Lips and it's always so great. I really really really with he performed some of his solo stuff...it was a really short set :-( 

**Paloalto ( + special guest G2)** 

* [No Love + Forrest Gump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY9DK4sLIaE)
* [Celebrate + Seoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgDHEsbXySM)
* [Turtle Ship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-P5GbgOSUY)
* [Yaga + Space Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Y0RNnyNh0)

For me Paloalto's felt like the longest set (perhaps to make up for the lack of Zico and Mino???) I don't know G2 so those parts were a little less fun but I thought Paloalto did an AMAZING job. I love Forrest Gump. I am also really glad they did Turtle Ship at all because I got super hyped on the way to the concert with that song and got a little nervous they wouldn't do it but IT WAS TURN UP #1. (He kept asking if we were ready to turn up lol) For Yaga, they brought out Jay Park and Dumbfoundead! 

**San E.**

* [Just Another Rapper + M.I.L.E. + Body Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAdVCtCdiyc)
* Tasty San
* [full set video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsJiO5xBlUI)

He did a new song he's coming out with at the beginning and then really short covers after Body Language (Straight Outta Compton, California Lovin') and then Tasty San was a lot of fun, especially him doing those little dance moves was great. I honestly didn't have any particular feelings towards San E. before the concert but his set was a lot of fun, he interacted with the crowd and really got everybody going. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would and I will definitely be checking out more from him. A little sad again about Black Nut but at least we got some M.I.L.E. 

**Verbal Jint (+ special guest Sanchez)**

* [The Power of Positive Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9HGjskwPJw)
* [Good Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRKlBU6deBs)
* [You Look Good (end part of this video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjrMZIz0NdU)
* [Good Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI0bFHxUweo)

Verbal Jint was also an awesome set. I was so sososososo excited they did Good Morning. They both interacted with the crowd a lot and were great doing it... Sanchez is so cute in person and it was funny how he kept talking about his brother (Microdot) and how he wasn't even on SMTM. They did a great job and I didn't know the song before but I really liked Good Times!

**Finale (San E., Verbal Jint, Basick)**

* Right before they went on, they played a little clip of the contestants, doing their photoshoot and some behind the scenes. There was a lot of Mino being adorable, which I guess was again to help make up for his absence. I haven't been able to find a link but I'm sure it'll pop up somewhere. 
* [My Zone + I'm the Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjOJFZeq0zM)

It of course makes sense for Basick to end the show, and I really liked all his performances on the show so this one was great. I'm the Man sounds waaaaaaaay better live than in studio if you ask me, probably cause it's more hype and everything too. The lyrics on the back screen helped make the set look really cool. Basick talked a bit about the end and really just thanked us and it was really touching :^) They didn't have everyone come out or anything though... which I was really really expecting and was so disappointed that it didn't happen. And no encore? Not sure how that would work but I was low-key still kind of expecting one.... 

Overall, it was an incredible concert and I had a really good time. I'm still bummed about no Mino and Zico because Okey Dokey and moneyflow are such great concert performance songs as well as I would have loved I'm Him, Fear and Tough Cookie but....it was still worth anyways. I really thought coming in that for sure Loco/Jay Park would be my favorite producer set but everyone was so awesome, I don't think I could possibly choose. I have so many more things to say probably but this is about all for this post, if anyone actually made it this far, hope you enjoyed. Lol.

824,2015-9-14,2015,9,14,13,3kve5t,"What are your opinions on the Lovelyz ""Seo Ji Soo"" scandal?",OriginalPromise,1442206133,"Ji Soo's name is everyone at the moment on Korean portal sites like Naver. 
In case you missed it, the scandal began last year around at April. 
http://www.koreaboo.com/featured/lovelyz-jisoo-accused-of-sexual-abuse-rape-assault-and-more/

She was accused of being a lesbian (nothing wrong with being gay. gay marriage is legal.), and that she sexually abused her partner during the time they were dating. She was also accused of being a bully on top of that. 
Now, it was summarized up to this point: 
http://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/09/the-fact-interviews-d-another-one-of-seo-ji-soo-s-alleged-victims (Read THIS!!)
http://www.koreaboo.com/news/fact-summarizes-lovelyzs-jisoos-scandal-replies-fan-group/

However, another bystander named ""D"" has acquired the alleged recording between JisooLuv (who has accused Jisoo on Twitter), herself, and Woollim. **She claims that Woollim shut JisooLuv up by threatening to sue her for damages, but also acknowledged that Ji Soo's actions were wrong.**

***""The Woollim rep said, ""Seo Ji Soo actually did tell us. I probably was the first one she talked to when the situation happened. She said, 'I was really lonely and exhausted then. I don't know what emotions I treated them with back then, but I don't understand why things are becoming so negative."" However, on the sexually harassing remarks Seo Ji Soo made, the Woollim rep did admit, ""Those comments and expressions are in fact sexually harassing, and it is true those actions themselves are morally problematic.""""***

 I tried to do some digging, but I couldn't find the recordings myself, sadly. If you read the Korean reports on ""The Fact"", ""D"" mentions that hers and JisooLuv's lives were ruined by Jisoo. (JisooLuv had to ""come out"" (In Korea, homosexuality is still frowned upon) thus making her daily life a challenge) Even if ""D"" wasn't directly approached by Woollim, she found JisooLuv through a portal site, and stayed by her side to let her know that she is not the only person who suffered through Ji Soo's antics. Furthermore, ""D"" mentions that JisooLuv suffered tremendous emotional hardships. JisooLuv reportedly went to the emergency room for dehydration because she cried too much, and even attempted suicide. 

If this is true, I would be really disappointed on Jisoo and Woollim in general but we don't know for sure at the moment. What are your thoughts on this topic? I'm just concerned about Lovelyz members' careers because their ""innocent and pure"" image they were going after looks like its ruined by the scandal. 

Please note that I'm not putting blame on anyone right now. Lets keep it clean below and not create a fanwar!

&gt; **Reposting the following comment I made in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3kx0uu/dia%EB%8B%A4%EC%9D%B4%EC%95%84_%EC%99%A0%EC%A7%80_somehow_mv/):** *""[I would like to apologize for a small mistake I made regarding the 2nd title track.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3kx0uu/dia%EB%8B%A4%EC%9D%B4%EC%95%84_%EC%99%A0%EC%A7%80_somehow_mv/cv19w8p) I just went on the Korean music sites and they did in fact debut with double title tracks. The 2nd title track for their debut album 'Do It Amazing' is 'Lean On Me'. You can listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bb_JSb32Qs).  Was pretty confused... To be fair, most of the fans who were following them during their pre-debut phase were given the impression that ['   '](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdMzazwxhBQ) was going to be their 2nd title track. There were even articles (?) coming out that claimed the song was going to have a sexy theme, and the fancam provided further support for these claims. In any case, seeing how they have actual choreography and what seems to be a finished song, it is very likely that it was reserved for a repackaged album or a future release.""*

1290,2015-9-22,2015,9,22,8,3lv7nq,What if Wonder Girls never went to the States?,hk0125,1442876486,"I always wondered about this. When Wonder Girls first came out, they were such a huge hit. 

SNSD who?

Back then SNSD was basically non-existant compared to WG. Seriously every song WG came out became an instant hit. They were basically the first girl group idol in the second generation and they paved the way. But JYP decided to take the group over states which I thought was a horrible idea. I would rather live life as a king in a small country than a peasant in a big country. WG never achieved success in the states. If you ask your non-kpop American friends, I'm pretty sure most if not all of them know who they are. 

As they spent more time overseas, other girl groups got more popular and bigger such as SNSD and Kara. Overtime fans began to lose interest in WG and they fell off from the top 3 (when the top 3 was WG, SNSD, and Kara). They had member changes and different members leaving the group.

So I wonder... what if WG never went to US and kept on promoting in South Korea. Would the group be big as SNSD right now and would they have the same five members when they started? ",8,0

1370,2015-9-23,2015,9,23,13,3m0zew,So the BTS Highlight Tour in San Francisco is going on right now and apparently it's kind of disaster.,tgmwatudoin,1442981681,"For those who don't know, BTS are currently touring North America under the ""Highlight Tour"" banner. I follow a few kpop accounts on twitter and right now Im constantly hearing from the people that went to the event in SF that the entire thing was disappointing at best and a disaster at worst. It also seems that everyone is attributing the blame to TGM events, who organized the whole tour in the first place. Here's just a few things that I've gathered so far:

-There were a LOT of technical issues surrounding the ticket purchases prior to the concert.

-Just days before the event, ticketholders were told not to arrive early to line up at the venue, otherwise security would cancel their passes. This forced many attendees to change their plans last minute. (https://twitter.com/tgm_events/status/645475231549624320)

-In addition, ticket holders were also informed that seats would be automatically assigned. This was cause for concern since many people would be arriving to the concert in groups, and there was a large chance that these groups would not be able to sit together. (see above link)

-Once people got into the venue, however, seating assignment was seemingly not enforced, and people with general admission often found themselves with better seats than those with VIP tickets.

-The concert itself was about an hour long, with BTS only being onstage about half that time. They performed a grand total of four songs.

-After the concert, people waited outside in the cold to get their Hi-Touch and Photo Op. Apparently they didn't check to see if anyone was a VIP ticket holder, so people with general admission got to Hi-Touch BTS earlier than VIPs without even paying for it.

-Also, apparently photo ops contained 25 fans per photo instead of 8, which from what I hear was what was initially promised.

-It appears that many fans did not have positive experiences with security. Skimming through my timeline people have recounted more than three separate instances of security being rude and impolite to them. One attendee even experienced downright racism from the guards (""ching chong ling long"" type of thing).

If any of you on this subreddit actually went to this event, Im sure many people on this sub would love to hear your story. Honestly, from where Im standing this seems like grounds for a mass refund or a class-action lawsuit or something.

UPDATE: TGM has posted [an official response to this whole debacle on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/tgmeventsglobal/posts/526195714201766)

1458,2015-9-24,2015,9,24,19,3m6ojx,Calling all K-hiphop enthusiasts: What are crews?,Hyperion98,1443092346,"Only just recently got in to k-hiphop scene (I know that I'm pretty late) and just wanted to understand it more. I find it fascinating (not sure SMTM shines an accurate light on the way the entire underground system works and the Korean hiphop culture; think they purport it in a way to make it more controversial).

Just came across the existence of 'crews' in the hip-hop scene and just had several questions that I hope more experienced hip-hop devotees can explain to me:

What are crews in Korean hip-hop?
Are there conflicts between different crews?
Which are the most prevalent?

Additionally, I find it interesting that different artists in a crew seem to be signed on to entirely different agencies. I know the big hip-hop agencies include AOMN, Brave New, Amoeba, Illionaire.
How does being in a 'crew' correspond with the agency you are signed with?
Do artists tend to congregate among their crews or to their agencies?
Like, are divisions in the scene related to which agency you are signed to or which crew you are in?

Similarly, recently read about the little diss battle that went on between E-Sens, Simon D, Swings some time ago.
Are there really such strong divisions between artists in the scene?
As much as there is in, say, American hip-hop?

Thanks to anyone willing to enlighten me about this :)",6,4

1461,2015-9-24,2015,9,24,21,3m6w0l,My University School Project In Korea About Korean Fans / Intl Fans :) In The Korean Music Industry,EyOhEmGi,1443097369,"Hello Everyone! I've been living in South Korea for almost 2 years now in Hongdae/Hongik University. And I've always been curious about what's the different between Koreans and INTL fans when it comes to korean music!. 

So these past few months i started a project for my university and the topic was ""Difference Between Us And You"" which u could choose any topic you wanted. some took cultures, behaviour etc. and i choose to take Korean Music.

So as a korean growing up in Sweden i didn't actually know that there was a HUGE different between intl fans and fans in korea when it comes to K-Pop/K-Hip-Hop or just korean music overall.

So i started as a BIGBANG fan in late 2007/early 2008. and then just grew in naturally in K-Pop and loved K-Pop so much. From what i've seen on youtube or other sites INTL fans no matter AGE loves K-Pop even tho you wouldn't understand it or just might as well do cause so many INTL people now are studying Korean because of K-POP/DRAMAS. 

in 2013 i i came to Korea and i made a few friends that i still hang out with today. Telling them i love K-Pop and they're shocked? why? today im 22 INTL age, and they told me when i was 20 ""aren't you to old for K-Pop?"" i was like why? then i just thought (oh these people might not like their own music maybe they're more into american music) but the more time i spent in korea i felt like K-Pop was only loved by koreans at 5 years old to 15. by at the time passed my love for K-Pop went from 100 to 0 real quick. You might ask me why? cause i started to listen to what they play in clubs or what is more ""respected in korea"" as koreans say especially for my AGE and that was K-Hip Hop/R&amp;B.

anyways let's jump over to my project.

So i went to Hongdae exit 8 (there's many students and peope in all ages there, clubs/resturants 24/7) i handled out some papers and asked them to answer my questions. after doing this project for almost 2 months in different areas like Gangnam, apgujeong rodeo, itaewon ( where most foriegners are) insadong, sinsa-dong, ehwa etc i noticed how koreans over 18+ really hates K-Pop so when u see the k-netz talking to you or dropping hate comments or anything they're 15 years old AVERAGE. anyways here's the TOP 10 artist that koreans loved the most

Do You Feel Different with what koreans listen to in Your age ? who's your favorite artist?/song, where are you from? gender and what's your age :)? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*UPDATE: 
I've seen many comments about how people are curious about why Koreans doesn't love K-Pop after being older so i would like to share with you a few comments they gave me of why before i'll upload my Youtube video of our project which has not been fully edited yet as it's my first time making a video :). So i got all the answers in Korean ofc so ill translate it for you :).
*NOTICE: Age is counted in Korean Age System

Q: K-Pop it's big all over the world and there's various of fans no matter of age, but in Korea K-Pop it's not that popular when you're becoming an older, why is that?

1. First of all i am really thankful for foreigners to love music that is coming from Korea, i have a lot of foreign friends that came to korea because of K-Pop, but honestly i think there's much more to see of Korea than just K-Pop and many of them doesn't even know or understand korean and just liking the sound which makes me think that its really awesome of them. But if they start to understand korean &amp; K-Pop lyrics i think their mind will change, It's sounds kind of cheesy?. Male,23 (Cheongdam-Dong) (Likes Coldplay, Oasis)

2. I don't love k-pop and i don't hate K-Pop, there's is actually a few K-Pop songs on my playlist, but mostly K-Pop songs are very childish?. For example do you know EXO ? They have a song called   (Wolf) and if you have heard the lyrics it's really really bad. I don't understand actually why foreigners &amp; and some koreans like those kind of songs. Female, 27 (Hapjeong) (Likes Neon Bunny, Calvin Harris)

3. I don't think age matter when it comes to K-Pop there's a lot of older and young people that hates K-Pop and loves K-Pop, but personally i don't like K-Pop, The lyrics it's not very well written and i think a lot of K-Pop bands/songs doesn't have their own sound? Male.25, (Hongik University) (Likes Tablo &amp; Beenzino)

4. I actually think that foreigners would feel exactly the same like us if they had boybands in their own country with make-ups singing cute songs, having this fake image and having the same topic when it comes to lyrics. Female 21 (Sadang) (Likes Beenzino &amp; Crush)

5. Ahh... Idols.... K-Pop for me it's like cartoons, once you grow older you leave that behind cause it's to corny..... Male,23 (Dongdaemun) (Likes Jay Park, B-Free)

6. K-Pop to us it's like no very well made music? and sometimes they use akward english which doesn't make sense with the korean language they mix with. male 27, female 26 (Insadong) (Likes Beenzino, Swings, Giriboy, Primary)

7. I think the reasons koreans don't like K-Pop in my age it's because K-Pop it's focusing more to the younger audience? And it's not that appealing to us korean in my age. Female,29 (Gangnam-Gu) (Likes Loco, Amy Winehouse)

8. It amazed me that foreigners loves K-Pop even without speaking a word of korean. But please visit our country loving our culture,food and other things instead of coming here becuase of K-Pop! I would say the reason i don't like K-Pop it's becuase there's better korean music? Male, 23 (Anguk) (Likes Dynamic Duo, Zion.T)

9. It's a funny question, i heard many non-koreans K-Pop fans comes to K-Pop becuase american music it's bad? and Koreans hate's K-Pop becuase we think Western music it's more awesome and very well made. Female 24 (Itaewon) (Likes Chris Brown, Jay Park)

10. Korean not loving K-Pop when it comes to an such of age has nothing to do with it. I think it's kind of hard to explain? it's just lame... but to all your foreigners that is coming to korea i think your love of K-Pop will change when you visit here and learn korean. Male, 24 (Yaksu) (Likes The Beatles, Nirvana)

My Youtube Video Will Be Up Next Week. So I'll Post It Here Then. I Have To Sub A 24 Min Video And Edit Everything Myself. So Please Wait ^^

[This thread roots from this article here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3m7swc/article_netizens_rave_over_selfmade_choreography/)

I've noticed that a lot of their dances seemed to be influenced from crews that have participated in ABDC.

Examples:

[This section](https://youtu.be/_E3xrZUZCqU?t=12s) is similar [to D-trix &amp; Co's dance](https://youtu.be/lV3TiOLaIM0?t=1m10s),

[The hand in through the arms](https://youtu.be/_gDYkYIApNQ?t=19s) is similar to [Mike Song's move in his ABDC perf.](https://youtu.be/SVDa_ua9BRQ?t=1m37s)

And in general, their dancestyle is very similar to Kinjaz, Mos Wanted, Quest and the general beat hitting style. I'm not saying that it's a direct copy nor are they not allowed to have the same style of dancing as others out there, but to call it all self-made imo seems kinda sketchy. Biting someone else's moves is pretty bad in the dance community and people get shunned for that. Of course, this is only from a glance from two of their videos, and they are pretty new so I guess I'll have to see what happens from here on out.

Once again, I'm not hating. I just thought I'd put this out there. What's everybody else's opinions on this?",13,0

1567,2015-9-27,2015,9,27,1,3mhb2u,"Proposing ""Throwback Thursdays""",JessiTee,1443285535,"Hey /r/kpop,

While some members of the subreddit are certainly enjoying this latest wave of ""Throwback"" posts, the mods are a little wary of having the front page flooded with older MVs. It's gotten to the point where some users were reporting the throwback posts in annoyance and complaining to the mods about it.

To compromise, I'd like to propose that we do Throwback Thursdays, where a sticked thread is posted every Thursday for people to talk about their favorite older K-pop songs and groups. That way we can still have a place to have that discussion and feel the nostalgia without bumping down newer, more relevant content off the front page.

If an older song or performance has never been posted before and you'd like to share it outside of the throwback thread, you can still do so, just flair it with [MV]. [Audio], [Live] as necessary and include the date at the end of the title if you'd like to clarify that it's an older music video or song.

I'd like to get feedback from you all before implementing this, so please let me know your thoughts. Thanks!",99,225

There was posts of even people standing in the rain and not be seated for the show, turning away alot of people and forcing them to go home. I wish good luck for Toronto's show, even though nothing is going to improve.

1594,2015-9-27,2015,9,27,13,3mjlst,Highlight Tour Atlanta,k4zoo,1443327136,"I wanted to get this out before I fell asleep and everything is clear in my mind.  This post isn't about how amazing the boys were on stage or anything like that, it's simply my experience dealing with staff, other concert-goers, and how everything went.

I arrived at 1pm to the venue where there was a long line that everyone was in to get wristbands and shirts.  Including VIP, autograph, photo-op.  This was already a bad idea because the line was very long so it took a long time to process everyone.  I feel from the very beginning there should have been two lines: VIP and everyone else.  As it got later and later, staff finally decided to cull everyone higher up in the tiers from the line.  Too bad this started at like 3pm when some tier perks were suppose to start at 5.  So sure enough, it's getting closer and closer to 5pm there are still VIPs etc not checked in with wristbands.

I blame the staff for not starting this culling earlier but I also blame some VIPs.  On three occasions, a person that had been standing in line with the rest of us general admission folks would ask after standing there for like 45 minutes to an hour were they in the VIP line.  You spent $300 and you won't even speak up for yourself,  The first thing I would have done if I were VIP were to walk right up to that main door and let staff know that I was VIP and where should I go.  This was AFTER the culling, mind you.  So you're just standing in line with general admission, and you could have just asked anyone where to go, but no, everyone's afraid to speak up?

You know the staff for this event has been terrible, so you must know that you have to be on that ass so YOU get right.  I witnessed a VIP standing in line with general admission while the autograph session was going on with a deer in the headlights look on her face when we finally discovered she was VIP and that she needed to go up to the main door NOW and get checked in.  This was after 5pm which I believe was the posted time for autograph sessions on the TGM facebook so why wouldn't you know this???

from what little I did see of the autograph table, everything moved extremely quickly but I didn't see anyone run out of posters? Hopefully autographs went well, I wasn't there to witness all of it.

checking in was strange since everything was done on paper? but if it works, it works, I guess.  Apparently this bad press on TGM has sent out the big guns (lol).  A woman was working the check in table who claimed to be a financial advisor for TGM that was sent in to help out with this mess.  sooo yay? 

Another thing, the woman that they had announcing information at the door really needed to speak up or had a megaphone or something because she was spewing important info that you couldn't even hear unless you were right next to her.  Which is unfortunate, because I would say she was trying to do a good job.  They had her out in that rain with no umbrella for HOURS and she was still pleasant I had no problems with her other than she was speaking way to low.

Concert started a bit late but I wasn't checking on my clock.  Didn't seem to start too late to me, but some young ins in the audience were getting testy.  There were a few audio problems but eh, it was fine.  I couldn't even hear the singing over the deafening sound of the crowd. ARMYs go hard I guess!

The Boys: I've been reading everywhere that they look tired and skinny and exhausted.  They do look tired, but otherwise they look fine to me.  They only have one more stop on the tour, they seemed happy to be performing this random ass tour to the best of their abilities, and they were very polite to everyone despite all the stuff they are going through.  I have to keep remembering, they are a relatively new group.  This does suck what they are going through, but over the years in kpop, I've read about a lot worse than a 4 city tour where they get a day or two between appearances.  I'm not saying we have to accept it, because things do have to change, but that's just how it is right now.  I do appreciate that I got to see them in person though.

now, onto what I just found out on the way home: around 100 people were not let into the venue at all due to TGM over selling tickets so they missed the concert.  Instead they were only able to do the hi touch and photo op but they were getting a refund as well.  That's just...horrible and I feel so bad for those people.  Ugh, what a shit show.

Well, in conclusion, there were fuck ups on both sides, mostly TGM though. I feel reports of how terrible this whole thing was were exaggerated on social media, but the whole situation is still bad.

I said I would post my experience when I went so here it is.  Feel free to add anything that I may have forgotten, I'm only seeing this from the POV of a general admission goer that had a great time, met a lot of cool people in line, and was just happy to be able to have this chance to see and touch BTS.  No complaints here.  Well, ok, small complaint: the shirts ran a bit big, a medium is huuuuge I should have got a small.  However, I like the material the shirt is made out of, so that's ok.

So I thought I'd answer any questions for future participants!",En_D,1443420524,"Overall, it was a really good experience for me! I still don't know if I passed the first round or anything, but I thought it was fun regardless!

Ask away!

Edit 1: 

You go into the audition room in groups of 5, and there was one judge, that was a relief for me lol (but you don't talk to her and she doesn't talk to you, no introductions) I do not know if she's from JYP or if she's just sitting there to give instructions. If you are singing, which I was doing, you just stand on the ""T"" on the floor and just look at the camera and start singing. Sing to the camera not the judge. 

Biggest tip I have for everyone is to just relax and get comfortable before going in. I saw a lot of people leaving the audition room crying. Even if you make a mistake, own it and just keeping going! I think that'll make you stand out despite the mistake! And make sure you look like you're having fun! You're there to get your big break, look like you want to be there!

There was diverse group of people there, mostly Asians, but a lot of African Americans as well. There is a picture on the JYP audition facebook group. (https://www.facebook.com/jypaudition)

I have not heard back yet and I don't know when I will hear back from them. But I will keep you guys updated when I do get the results!

And for those of you guys interested in my singing level or what not, here is my youtube channel! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvPF4yNRK6ShIWHZMhLVClQ

You don't have to subscribe, but I would really love some constructive feedback. 

Thanks guys!

Edit 2: 

Someone else brought up another good question. You can only audition for one category. Either it be singing or dancing. You can only pick one. 

As for POCs auditioning, I told someone down below:

""I feel like POC are disadvantaged, but there needs to be a change... So I think people like you going to the auditions and killing it would induce great change! Big companies need to realize that KPOP is a global phenomenon. The only way it can continue to grow is to diversify it!""

I've never recorded a video for Youtube before, and all I had was my computer's built in web cam, but it's not too bad in terms of quality.

I don't think I have the heart to give my full opinion of all the songs, but I am really enjoying the album for first impressions of all the songs. It is so clear to me in these songs that GOT7 has developed a lot musically. I love it and hope they get the recognition they deserve. My favorite tracks so far though are Feels Good and If You Do. I am glad that Raise Your Hand wasn't the title track. ",18,46

I'm selling one Bigbang MADE Tour in LA (Staples Center) for October 3, 2015.
One of my friends can't go so we actually have an extra one and we're desperately looking for someone to buy it.

It's a GA Floor Ticket and we bought it for $227. We got the printed one and had it shipped to us so it's an actual ticket.
It would be awesome if you could pay full price but if not, let me know how much you're willing to pay.

Me and two of my friends are still going and we're actually planning to camp out from like 12nn so we could just meet there then I could give you the ticket and you could pay me in person so I don't have to worry about not being paid. Also, you don't have to worry that the ticket is not legit.

I live in San Diego so if you live near the area we can just meet up beforehand if you want!
PM me if you're interested. Kamsahamnida!

(Also, checked the rules, i don't know if there's anything against posting something like this but if there's an appropriate thread for it let me know!)",3,0

A new update came out for PS4 which enabled communities within PSN for people to discover others with similar interests and passions. I naturally had to create one for KPOP and wanted to let everyone know it's named ""KPOP Fans Unite!"". You have to select a ""primary game"" for the community so I just selected Destiny since it's the big hit right now.

I'm not entirely sure they set up an adequate search function yet, so if you want to join just search for me online (PSN: snoopypup248) and the community should be at the bottom of my profile. I'll get it spruced up and everything when I come home from class in an hour.

&lt;3

EDIT: Apparently it's easier to find them under the actual game tab, so check under the Destiny tab and it should be there!",5,13
