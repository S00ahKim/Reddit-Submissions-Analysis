The Town Hall is an opportunity for the mods to make announcements and propose changes, while also getting feedback from you guys about those changes and the current state of the subreddit.  Please feel free to comment about any issues that have been bothering you, and provide any suggestions you may have to make r/kpop a more enjoyable place.

&amp;nbsp;

---

**Agenda**

1.  March Town Hall Follow-up
2.  What is K-Pop?
3.  Love it or hate it?
3.  New Business     

---

&amp;nbsp;

#### March Town Hall Follow-up

Thanks for everyone's feedback last month.  It seems like you guys are pretty happy with the way things are regarding group shows and former K-Pop idols, so we won't make any changes there.  When awards season comes around this year, we will allow collab stages and song cover stages to have their own posts so you won't miss any unique special stages.  Sound good?

&amp;nbsp;

#### What is K-Pop?

There was a lot of discussion about what exactly qualifies as ""K-Pop"" during and after [this recent thread about Korean/American drag queen Soju](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/84slgx/korean_drag_queen_sojus_minialbum_to_address_the/).  We do not currently have a strict definition of K-Pop and often allow a wide range of Korean pop-ish music.  As we said during that thread, while we don't want to become r/kindie or r/koreanmusic, we understand that our users occasionally like to explore music outside the core K-Pop idol industry so we allow some of that.  We don't want the sub flooded with K-indie music, but we don't want to shut it out entirely either.  That said, if you guys demanded it, we could pin down a more strict definition of K-Pop and remove everything that doesn't fit it.  However, we are worried that may cause some unintended consequences because not every artist fits in a neat little K-Pop box.  You can scan down the list of [recent audio releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/search?q=flair%3Aaudio&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) and spot many unfamiliar artists that aren't part of the idol system or signed to a major Korean entertainment company.  Do you guys want to get rid of these fuzzy edges, or do you like to keep them around to discover new music?

&amp;nbsp;

#### Love it or hate it?

Since this is a short Town Hall, we thought it would be fun to get a little more direct feedback on what you love and don't love about r/kpop.  In the comments, let us know what's the one thing you **LOVE MOST** about r/kpop and/or what's the one thing that you **HATE MOST** about it?  We'll do our best to expand the things that you love and fix the things that you hate.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",120,44

[Sofia] (https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg5XlzdjMr0/?taken-by=sonysonny03): 
  
&gt;I'm sorry to inform you about this, but from this day on our team will no longer exist. Because of disagreements with the company, this time we decided to split (but this doesnt mean that each of us will stop our creative activities, so you can continue to watch us.) I'm sorry for not meeting your expectations this time, we also really wanted to release the album, but because of the the current situation with our company it became impossible. :( It would be great if you continued to follow each of the members. Thank you very much

&gt;Hi there, this is Sanha/Sarang.
  
&gt;Omaju has left the company and Sanha, Seo Sarang, and Sofia decided to go their own way.
  
&gt;I posted a short notice in the official cafe. I'm sorry I cannot tell you a lot about big and small things. The fans who waited for O My Jewels comeback, and those who have always been cheering more positively than us, we are so thankful that we can't express everything.
  
&gt;I am so sick of telling you disappointing news.
  
&gt;Please look out for the Sanhas, Sarangs and Sofias individual activities.
  
&gt;Thank you so much for a great year and a great love.
  
  
[Update from Sofia] (https://www.instagram.com/p/BhGCtpDDWiu/?taken-by=sonysonny03): 
&gt;Hmm... many asked me to tell you all what I will do next... I can say that as for the career of being a singer in Korea, I will not refuse and very soon you will be waiting for some interesting news ~ As for the mini fan-meeting...We just have to decide where and when.
   
[Update from Seo Sarang] (https://www.instagram.com/p/BhBUFYQhkKT/?taken-by=s__sarang): 
  
&gt;Thank you very much for cheering me up. Although it is still difficult and burdensome, please take care of your heart.
  
&gt;I'll grow to be a more mature and beautiful adult. Please keep an eye on Sarang's activities. I'll keep you posted.
  
&gt;April is a great month. I love all you Jewels, please dont be sick, stay healthy and happy.
   
*****
I cant say that Im surprised by this considering Frientree demoted Blity back to trainee status without a word (and I think they all left the company too) but its unfortunate. Im glad they did have a lot of support considering that people were actually rooting for them to fail, and Im even happier knowing that they will continue to pursue their entertainment careers. 
  
Edit: I just wanted to add, this is Sanha and Sarang's third group to disband. I've been following theme since SUS4 and I really feel bad both as a fan and just in general. I hope they all find success at some point.",12,127

As you know, korean fansites have been said by intl fans to whitewash idols and make them look pale. While intl fans tend to edit/choose photos that showcase these idols looking tan

I have noticed that intl fans tend to hype up photos of idols looking tan (same skintone as SEAsians etc.).

Is that an ok attitude tho to really hype up these ""tan idols""? Or are we just acting like these Korean fansites obsessing over their skin color?

What are your thoughts on ppl worldwide's obsession with skin color?

The other obvious big one would be 2NE1's ""I Am The Best"" soundtracking Microsoft's biggest ad campaign of 2014 (stretching into 2015 and even 2016, if I'm not mistaken). You could probably also count Louis Vuitton's $80 million USD investment in YG around the same time, too. And then there are smaller examples, like YSL's makeup brand hiring Ga-in to star in an online ad campaign that featured her song ""Paradise Lost"" in 2016.

Also, thanks to everyone who participated next week! I went into last weeks thread with the intention of making it shitpost-esque, so I didnt know how people would react but all of yall who participated played along and it was really, really funny reading all your comments! Youre totally allowed to be funny and extra in any of your reviews and/or comments: as long as youre not inflammatory, respectful of the artist and only criticize the song, you are free to say whatever you want. 

Read the Other Business section! Theres a lot of important info in there this week.

Thanks for participating, good luck with guessing this weeks theme, and hope you have a great weekend and a good week! Enjoy listening to the songs I picked out this week :)",41,23

631,2018-04-08,2018,4,8,9,8amcmy,Request Kpop Videos for translation (Week 19),ThisGuyKpops,1523146739,"Hi, my name is JOJO owner of thisguykpops on youtube. I usually translate kpop song, but decided to try something different this time.  I will be translating kpop video clips that doesnt have translation.  First time doing kpop video rather than kpop song, so I will update on rules as I go but as of now...

1. Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word. 

2. Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. Word for word if it is necessary. 

3. Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes. 

3. The most upvoted video, Ill translate...within .....decent length....

4. I dont know how many videos Ill get..so I can only promise first top 5 will definitely be done, and others will be...based on time constraint

5. Leave a link and what you would like to get out of it. 
BAD EXAMPLE: can you find a clip and translate where Idol XXX was talking about this?  (uuhh NOPE)
GOOD EXAMPLE: This clip (with link), i am curious to what XXX is saying in general

6. If possible, a official clip is preferred. Mostly because I can definitely hear better.

Think thats about it...i know kpop song is fine in this sub, but not sure about kpop videos. If its inapporiate, almight lord sirbuckeye will remove it. 

Be back in 48 hours. Good luck!",12,28

---------

[Full Explanation on how Thai military enlistment works](https://twitter.com/GOT7NOW/status/978565060300759040)

BamBam's odds at the start of the draw were rumoured to be 4 red cards out of approximately 314 cards (some individuals did not pass the health check): 

* Saimai district's quota for today was ~90
* 600 were part of today's selection
* 200 individuals had deferred
* 74 have volunteered 
* BamBam was given the number 577 for the selection process

---------

Clarification: BamBam did not have to draw any card. The Thai military had initially asked BamBam to come forward to demonstrate how the draw would work, but shortly after revealed that there would not be any draw selection today as all 74 red cards were voluntarily taken, meaning everyone else ""received"" a black card.

---------

[Update](http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=421&amp;aid=0003307497): JYP confirms BamBam has been exempt and will not need to draw, due to district meeting the quota for enlistment through volunteers.

Personally in terms of music I hope we have less tropical pop than last year but keep the fun bright MV vibe that comes with that genre usually.            
Realistically I think we'll get a lot of trap-esque boy group beats similar to [BTS' Fire](https://youtu.be/ALj5MKjy2BU) and more western styled songs like [Mamamoo's Starry Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjUXm0Zy_dk).              
Overall it seems like lately tropical house has fizzled out, so we can only pray we don't get tropically bombarded like last summer!               
*Considering Summer music starts generally mid-late May to June, this is a great time to guess what trends we'll be seeing especially since the prep-time for a well-produced song and promotional cycle can take a long time!",45,44

973,2018-04-12,2018,4,12,3,8bj5t2,Which genres would you like to see incorporated more into Kpop?,weiss244,1523469716,"Inspired by recent news of Hyoyeon's upcoming album, I've noticed Kpop in recent times has drawn a lot of its influences from a variety of EDM genres like house (and its' variants), trap and dubstep but I'm curious to see what certain styles/genres you would like to hear more in Kpop? 


For example, I'd like to hear more hardstyle incorporated into Kpop. A.C.E. have demonstrated that it does work (surprisingly) and has a place in Kpop with their title tracks Cactus and Callin'. You can hear some of the genre's elements in both tracks such as the signature 4x4 kicks and pitched screeches



Some examples:  [Faye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtYDvqJgQqo),  [Imaginary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9I-9Sj4sKs) and my personal favorite [Zombie-e-e-e](https://youtube.com/watch?v=8ga_tSyiRvQ)


I used EDM as my focus because I listen to a lot of it outside of Kpop but I encourage everyone to think outside of the box so surprise me!

I picture the stage design would be super bright and loud, and instead of Hyuna having backup dancers as she normally does, EXID would do the choreo with her, and Hyuna would obviously kill EXID's choreo too. At the end the stage goes dark and you see five silhouettes, and you'd think it's 4 EXID + Hyuna but it's actually, drumroll please, all 5 of EXID, and then Hyuna comes back out to join them for the big group ending. (I'm hyping myself up way too much for a fictional stage rip). Also Hyuna and LE on the same stage would be instantly amazing.

If your dream collab mashup song hasn't been made you can answer with two songs that you think would work! (And be creative with stage ideas since this should be more than a mashup rec thread :)

More recently, I've noticed that BG fans will only claim to like Blackpink and maybe Red Velvet. They will say ""GGs are too cute for me"" or similar excuses. I just don't get it. It just doesn't make sense when there are girl groups experimenting with every concept under the sun for people to say they don't like ggs because of cute concepts. I honestly think the reason they don't like girl groups is underlying misogyny. I don't think they or anyone mean any harm by it, but it still sucks. What's your take on this?

EDIT: I sincerely do not mean to imply that ALL boy group fans HATE girl groups or anything of that nature, and I also didn't mean to make it seem like girl group fans can't be the same way towards bgs. I've just encountered it this way WAAAYYY more often in my 9+ years of being a fan of kpop, and I just feel like I am alone in my way of thinking. ",94,0

Basics: For my own sanity, I'm trying to keep it to albums that sold over 5K in the month, but I know that there are a lot of groups (especially nugus) that you guys are interested in (and I don't follow every group out there to know who is or isn't releasing something and when). If there is a group who had an album come out in **March** that isn't listed in the chart and you'd like me to see if there is a number available for them, please request in the comments with the group and album name.

If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

__ TAPAS __

&gt; Four distinct vocal flavors served over an electric guitar with a spicy Latin twist. Comes with a side of our famous mind- blowing harmonies!

__ FIRST COURSE __  
  
*[NCT U  Baby Dont Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DqRstCgj4)*  
&gt; Hot with a sizzling taste, using the finest peppers and a subtle earthy flavor given by Chef Taeyong's raps

*[BoA - One Shot Two Shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg_4tbLnIOc)*  
&gt; Catchy ear worm from the Queen of Kpop, which will leave you singing and dancing and wishing it never ended

__ ENTREE __

*[SEVENTEEN - Habit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co34EipkpYY)*  
&gt; Emotional yet strangely catchy ballad-y song by Seventeen's first class vocal unit, perfect for emo car rides with the windows down.

*[LOO 1/3  Sonatine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6JmCdDs_GM)*  
&gt; The sweet-savory combination! Classic French flavors with some Chinese influences as well. Melodies and harmonies served *only* well-done!

__ DESSERT __
   
*[Stray Kids  Third Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJacppNh3NU)*  
&gt; Served in a clear mason jar topped with liquid nitrogen; everything is on display but you're too mesmerized to eat it or do anything else 

*[Uhm JungHwa  Ending Credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-5jAM0Zt4w)*  
&gt; A bittersweet finisher to your meal, leaving you with a sense of nostalgia and melancholy, with a side of electric blue velvet.

I randomly decided to look up what the song was and turns out it was  [Troye Sivan's Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAghEq5Lfw). Ever since, the song has been near the top of my most-played list! I doubt I would have listened to it without the influence of Hobi/Jimin because Troye was never really on my radar. And now look, a new favourite song!

Have you discovered any songs thanks to K-pop that you might not have noticed otherwise?",105,110

1313,2018-04-16,2018,4,16,5,8chzt9,EXO's Chen makes racist remark in a recent V-Live and the subs ''hide'' this remark.,Junscommahair,1523824279,"(There hasn't been an official news article yet, but I was shocked how many people where defending and denying this on twitter. I do not find it accaptable that this could be sweeped under the rug because the VLive subs show something different.)   

In EXO-CBX's recent VLive, Chen compared his overdrawn lips to those of the black fictional character [Kunta Kinte] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunta_Kinte). But weirdly enough the [english subs] (https://twitter.com/yungbrittbrat/status/985601065117716481) show that he said ''my lips look too plump''. This isn't a right translation,  because the korean subs show [this] (https://twitter.com/search?f=images&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=kunta%20kinte&amp;src=typd). Everyone who can read hangul can clearly see that the second word is 'Kunta Kinte'. And you can also hear him saying the word ''Kunta Kinte''. But instead of calling Chen out, fans are defending him on twitter and dragging other idols into this mess. 

I decided to make this post because it is 2018 and we need to start calling all idols out if they do or say something racist. Hopefully this post isn't against the guidlines op r/kpop . ",536,841

However, I'm a lonely cheeseball who likes seeing people be deeply close with each other, so can y'all provide what you believe to be some good hardy platonic/familial dynamics?

# Intro &amp; History
JBJ () is a six-member group under Fave Entertainment. In the first half of 2017, the members participated in Produce 101 Season 2, where they were all eliminated after episode 10. After the show ended in June, fans started grouping Kenta, Yongguk, Sanggyun, and Taedong together as a potential debut group. Fans later added Taehyun, Donghan, and Hyunbin, and they named the group JBJ, short for Just Be Joyful (and also as a reference to I.B.I, a debuted group of eliminated Produce 101 Season 1 contestants). Other interpretations of JBJ include   (psychotic zone, because they were close to the finals), and    (please give us screentime). [The members](https://www.instagram.com/p/BV6iBtrAbmW/?taken-by=roh_taehyun&amp;hl=en) were receptive to the idea of debuting together, and six of the members companies and Fave agreed on a seven-month contract with the option for extension. However, Taedongs conflict with his company prevented him from joining the group.

JBJ debuted on October 18, 2017 with the mini-album Fantasy and the title track Fantasy. They held a sold-out debut showcase on the same day. Their first comeback was on January 17, 2018 with the mini-album True Colors and the title track  (My Flower). My Flower got JBJ their first win, on the January 26, 2018 episode of Music Bank. They held their first two-day concert on February 3-4, called Really Desirable Concert. The members companies and Fave started discussing a contract extension until December 2018, but eventually it was confirmed that JBJ would disband at the end of April. Their last comeback will be on April 17, 2018 with the repackage album New Moon and the title track  (Call Your Name). Their final concert will be on April 21-22, called Really Desirable Concert [Epilogue].

JBJs fandom name is Joyful, and their colors are [\#787FFF](http://www.color-hex.com/color/787fff) and [\#FFF787](http://www.color-hex.com/color/fff787).

# Shows

### Reality/Variety Shows

**[Just Be Joyful](http://www.vlive.tv/video/42973?channelCode=D864D9)**: This is their first reality show, which has 6 episodes. Episodes 1-2 split the group into pairs and each pair has a mission, episodes 3-4 involve them traveling to Japan, episode 5 has them doing missions throughout Seoul, and episode 6 shows them putting together their debut. Its a good start if youre new to JBJ, and youll get the group dynamics really quickly.

**[JBJ Reality Talk Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFMNxzfr24)**: Technically this is episode 0 of Just Be Joyful, but its getting its own paragraph. Its like most scripted VLives, except its in a bathhouse, and its JBJ, so it gets wild.

**[JBJs Drinking Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjRYQboWyoM)**: Honestly you cant really tell their drunk because theyre also like that when theyre sober.

**[JBJ Private Life Season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLOuuIS-EFU)**: This is more of a sit-down, playing games kind of show, so youd think theyd be calmer, but they really arent. These episodes are *long*, but the games they play are hilarious.

**[JBJ Private Life Season 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEZMzGISUkg)**: JBJ was so great the first time around that HeyoTV gave them another season for more shenanigans!

**[Prinsix Private Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMp0XQElzys)**: This was between PD101 and JBJs debut, and theres only four JBJ members (Kenta, Sanggyun, Hyunbin, Donghan) with two other PD101 contestants (Yoo Seonho and Lee Gunhee). Their chemistry is great, and theyre really funny. Yongguk also did a [Private Life series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6p0NC9ZwpY) with Kim Shihyun, Woo Jinyoung, and Park Woodam.

**[Honbab/Eating Alone](http://www.vlive.tv/video/54662/playlist/55726)**: Either Sanggyun or Donghan go out and eat alone, and they talk throughout the whole process. They actually get pretty deep sometimes because theyre by themselves, but the show does make you hungry.

**[Weekly Idol (with Samuel, MXM, Jeong Sewoon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Bgdhmg7Nk)**: A PD101 reunion episode! Honestly, this is worth watching just for [Taehyun krumping to Mr. Chu](https://youtu.be/s8Bgdhmg7Nk?t=1646).

**[JBJ X LieV](http://www.vlive.tv/video/44013?channelCode=D864D9)**: Theyre supposed to make you fall asleep, but they just end up roasting each other.

**[#7179_787](http://www.vlive.tv/video/44376?channelCode=D864D9)**: A series of behind-the-scenes tidbits.

How do you guys feel about these really chill videos w/ idols?             
I personally like to see the more candid chill videos like these that aren't super formal interviews but rather like a relaxed environment where the idols discuss their favorite cosmetics or casually talk to the makeup artists and such. It's also pretty nice to see the ""real"" aspect of what goes into becoming a stage-ready idol.",1,15

Also, on the flip side, were there songs that you appreciated more once you realized their lyrical masterpiece that you never who have understood if you didn't speak Korean? (e.g. witty lyrics, puns)",95,100

1485,2018-04-18,2018,4,18,0,8cxln6,Most explorative/out there lyrics/performances by groups you love?,monashah626,1523980495,"We always laugh about the cringe inducing lyrics like ""Ill take you in one mouthful like cheese"" and ""not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good, u kno"" in posts and for good reason too, but even the most meaningful and sexual lyrics for love songs tend to stay safely within vanilla realm which is understandable in a country like Korea. So what are some of the most interesting, sexually explorative lyrics a group has put out or a member has written? Additionally even performances that show different aspects would be great. 

Some lyrics I can think of on top of my head are:

 NCT's lyrics tend to be a bit sexual ~~kinky~~
Taeyong's verse in Baby don't like it:

*You should be afraid of me, thats what I want*

*I want you to hit and kick me, ruin me*


*Cosplay Snow White*

*I like it, Ill be the hobbit*

*Be meaner to me, I feel it babe*
 
and Whiplash is pretty obvious with the:

*Wake me with your whipping*

*My baby you are like (Ill take you) Palazzo Rocco*

There are some other ones but most of these lyrics are the ones Taeyong wrote ~~lowkey BDSM~~ so it makes me wonder what others are there that deviate from the usual lovey, sweet ones.

I was also very taken back with Momo's [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rpY57eJqfM&amp;index=37&amp;list=PLhGrzSWZsYMHaNvfDRlP_tbBF9PEYCJxa&amp;t=0s) in Hit the Stage because I never expected to see two girls in love, much less in a obsessive, destructive relationship especially from a more bubblegum group like Twice and I was blown away.

I'm not too familiar with Vixx but I think Chained up as a concept deviates from the traditional norm but as they are known for their concepts, I don't know to what extant they had creative control over what they were performing. 

Sorry if this offends anyone. I'm a huge NCT fan and when I was listening to the album, I was reading the lyrics and realized that I've never seen lyrics like this before in kpop (at least as far as I'm aware, although there could be a ton and I just never realized) and I though that would be an interesting discussion post.

So how long should I wait for the email?

I do this because it helps me discover new songs and I like helping out the kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is unsatisfactory, leave a link and ill Check if it warrants a new translation.

Be back in 48 hours to check",8,10

Obviously it  isn't difficult to figure this out from such a brilliant song but this got me curious about kpop songs that musically veils itself.

Other songs that I can think of so far which somewhat does this are AOA's [Miniskirt](https://youtu.be/q6f-LLM1H6U) which clearly has a sexy-sultry vibe but carries undertones of sadness from not feeling validated &amp; NCT 127's [Limitless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmUn7V6uuZM) which is overall hard-edged sounding with trap influenced breakbeats but  [hints](https://youtu.be/zmUn7V6uuZM?t=36s) &amp; [reveals](https://youtu.be/zmUn7V6uuZM?t=2m) then [expresses](https://youtu.be/zmUn7V6uuZM?t=2m49s) a romantic R&amp;B side within the song.

An example of this is to [VIXX LR -Beautiful Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55I7BIcysFQ).

The whole song talks about Leo wanting to leave the girl so she could have a better life, even though it hurts him and Ravi trying to convince himself that it's not worth it and they both love each other and need each other, and near the end, it shows Leo killing Ravi(the side not willing to let go), to let the girl they love go. And the lyrics change from *""I'm a beautiful liar""*, to ***""No, I'm a cowardly liar""***

TLDR; the song is saying I will suffer for your sake but in the end, he's just a coward for not being able to let go.",24,63

Now, to be clear, I know of the groups that have debuted since then and have them all on my list of ""groups to look into"" (I've just been really busy! haha), but I'm not exactly sure how well this or that group is currently doing in the KPop sphere... make sense? 

So, I thought it would be helpful/fun to have a discussion about what the current ""standings"" are (as in more objective facts than personal biases). I am excluding any groups from the Big 3 though, since I think it's rather impossible as a KPop fan to not know where they stand.

And... go! lol Here's some questions people can answer if they don't feel like just talking freely:

1. Which newly debuted groups had the most impact in 2015? 2016? 2017? Has their ""standing"" changed since then? How so? 

2. Which groups that debuted between 2015 and now have done the best? The worst (in regards to groups you thought would do well)? Who's working their way up? Who seems to be ""losing steam""? 

3. Who won the most awards? Who gained the biggest fandom? Who's been the biggest surprise? 

Stuff like that. 

As always: be respectful and have fun! This discussion isn't meant to be some definitive thing, just something to given people like me a general idea on who's where in KPopland. ",35,1

Not to be confused with JYPs Baek A-yeon, this A-yeon is a female drummer who is a member of the Korean girl band Bebop, which has been active since 2013.

Not much has been written about the group in English, but the group is signed to Loen Entertainment. While Im not certain, the groups debut single was [I Am The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ_f0MiDx6c)"", although they featured on Hummingbird Urban Stereos track [Maem Maem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-sDFUXskgU)"" a year prior.

The group has an active [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bebopofficial/), while A-yeon also have an active [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdld7SHk9IyYSkNrHA9B6Dw) channel where she posts her drum covers.

I havent been able to find much else about him in English.

**[NTB Debut Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_ntb_01/)**

* Date Project Ends: April 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is NTB?

Not to be confused with the other (now defunct?) boy group N.T.B., NTB is a six-member boy group signed to OneWorld Entertainment.

While not confirmed on their Makestar, it seems NTB stands for **N**augh**t**y **B**oys.

The group has been promoting in a Japan from what seems to be late 2017 but are finally ready to debut in Korea.

While not much has been written about them in English, the group does have an active [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ntbstagram/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4L4rdgE0L-GyCDdJcNHujA) page.

Also, fancams of their Japan promos make it seem that NTBs debut song is going to be called [L.O.V.E.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXeVqt6GP8U).


**[24K Photobook Mini Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_24k_03/)**

* Date Project Ends: May 10, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is 24K?

24K is a six (active) member boy group signed to Choeun Entertainment. The group is decently known on the sub, but Ill still do a quick and dirt summary of the group.

The group debuted in 2012 with the song [Hurry Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEd0qhNNmk0), though they started to slowly break out of nugudom with the 2015 single [Super Fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnmLjdvTeCE). Their most recent comeback was in 2017 with the song [Addiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPOvNE6y3CE).

The group has run two successful Makestar campaigns in the past for two [album](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_24k_2?locale=en) [releases](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_24k).

While the group has had some success in Europe and the US, theyve stayed firmly in nugu territory in Korea. Theyve also gone through a ton of lineup changes since their debut which no doubt made things difficult as well. At this time, seventh member Sungoh is completing his military service so hes technically considered an inactive member of the group right now.

The group recently appeared on YGs *MIXNINE* where the members described their experiences and struggles to continue staying as a group. Jinhong and Changseon were the only two members to make it past the audition rounds. Jinhong withdrew from the show before Episode 8 aired, with Chouen [stating](https://twitter.com/boysofmix9/status/941261077274415104?lang=en) that he did it to better focus on 24K activities. Changseon was eliminated in episode 7.

Jinhon's most notable performance was on Team KkoJjing performing a cover of BToB's ""[It's Okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtxjgInXRXE)"". Changseon's most notable performance was on Team Just8 performing a cover of Jason Derulo's ""[Kiss The Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVt0F1QqlhI)"".

You can read more about the group [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24K_(band\))


**[4Ten Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_4ten_01/)**

* Date Project Ends: May 17, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is 4Ten?

4Ten is a 3-member girl group signed to Jungle Entertainment. Initially a four member group, the group debuted in 2014 with the song [Tornado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCqUQxikvuI). 

However, the group has been marred with lineup changes pretty much every year since their debut to now. About a year after debut, two original members (TEM and Eujin) left the group. Heeo, Yun and Hajeong were added soon after, when the group also underwent a (brief) name change to POTEN. Hajeong left the group about 6 months later, and the group has since reverted back to using 4Ten. Yun left the group in 2017, though her departure wasnt announced until the group participated on YGs *MIXNINE* and saw trainee Jisoo performing with them. Jisoo was initially announced by Jungle Ent. to be the newest member of 4Ten, but it seems plans did not pan out as she was not included as a member on this Makestar.

The group hasnt has a proper comeback since 2016, where they released the song [Severely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxpOCMH3NeQ). On *MIXNINE*, Hyejin and Heeo were the only two to make it past the audition rounds, but both were eliminated in Episode 8. Heeos most notable performance was on the Auh~! Team performing [Puss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=978AqPbMZI8) and Hyejins most notable performance was on the Mix Nice team performing [Knock Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?=2&amp;v=9OI1oG1em0U).

The group has an active [twitter](https://twitter.com/4TEN_Official) page.


**[MxM Photobook Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_mxm_01/)**

* Date Project Ends: May 10, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

MxM needs no introduction since theyre decently known on the sub, but Ill a quick bio anyway.

MxM is a sub-unit that consists of Lim Youngmin and Kim Donghyun, two members that will eventually be included in Brand New Musics upcoming boy group (tentatively titled Brand New Boys).

The seemingly odd reason for Brand New promoting a subunit before the group actually debuts? Broduce 101.

All four confirmed members of Brand New Boys (Youngmin, Donhyun, Lee Daehwi, and Park Woojin) participated in Produce 101s second season.

At the end of the show, Daehwi and Woojin made it into the temporary group Wanna One, while Youngmin placed 15th and Donghyun placed 28th. Due to the nature of Wanna One members contracts with YMC, they cannot promote with their home labels while promoting as Wanna One. Thus, Daehwi and Woojin will not be able to join Brand New Boys until January 2019 so MxM was born to keep hype train rolling.

MxM officially debuted September 6, 2017 with the song [Im the One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3NfHbc9UU), and released their second mini album in January 2018. They are currently promoting as part of project group YDPP, which is a collab between Starship and Brand New. The members are MxM, Jeong Sewoon, and Lee Gwanghyun. All four were close friends on Broduce, to the point where fans nicknamed their group YoungDongPoPang (aka YDPP for short).

The name came from:

* **Young**min
* **Dong**hyun
* **Po**nyo (Sewoons nickname)
* **Pang** (Gwanghyuns nickname)

In order to keep the acronym, the group stated that the groups name comes from **Y**outh **D**ream **P**assion **P**urity. The group debuted on April 5, 2018 with the song [Love it Live It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdGzuQqoWo4).


**[DJ Aster Single Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/producer_djaster_01/)**

* Date Project Ends: May 21, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is DJ Aster?

So I havent been able to find too much about him in English, but based on his Makestar, he is signed to Leanon Entertainment.

Based on his Makestar stats, hes been active as a DJ since 2015, and focuses on EDM music. From what I can tell on his Makestar, it looks like he wants to go the David Guetta route and produce his own songs...maybe? Any people who read Korean/who knows anything more about him, feel free to post it in the thread so I can update things here.

I was able to find a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNUUmdaSRFw) of one of his setlists, though (some cursing is included in the mix, so be warned).


**[Favorite Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_favorite/)**

* Date Project Ends: May 25, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Favorite?

Favorite is a six-member girl group signed to Astory Entertainment.

The group debuted on July 4, 2017 with the song [Party Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8kGYosDhPE). Prior to their debut, the group did pre-debut promotions under the name Astory Girls.

Besides general stats about the members, not much else has been written about them in English.

They do have an active [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/officialFavorite/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpJTTbU6UUbaujM3wvm_4EA) channel though.

The project was initially slated to end April 30, but got a month extension.

**[MyTeen Fanmeeting project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_myteen_02/)** 

* Date Project Ends: May 27, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is MyTeen?

MyTenn is a seven-member boy group signed to The Music Works (the home of former 2NE1 member Minzy). The group debuted in July 2017 with the song [Amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI4_7iaJU6M).

The group hasnt had a comeback since then, but members Chunjin, Eunsu, Xiheon, Junseob and Yuvin did participate in YGs *MIXNINE*. Chunjin, Xiheon and Junseob were the only ones to pass the audition rounds, though. Chunjin was eliminated in episode 7 while Junseob was eliminated in episode 10. Xiheon placed 18th in the 13th episode.

Chunjins most notable performance was on Team One Way performing One Directions [What Makes You Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgJpcobW31k), Junseobs most notable performance was on Team Mazinger performing 2PMs [My House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIRi1j5MZbM)"", and Xiheons was on Team Gangnam Station performing Future Bounces [Super Freak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbWxa7u98Y)"".

The group also ran a [very successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_myteen?locale=en) for their debut album.

**[Voisper Official Album Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_voisper/)**

* Date Project Ends: May 31, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Voisper?

Voisper is a four-member vocal group signed to Evermore Music.

The groups name comes from the meshing of **voi**ce and whi**sper**. The groups origins are actually kind of cool. So, all the members were actually close friends in high school, where they decided to become a vocal group in their 2nd year. They auditioned for the sixth season of *Superstar K* in 2014 under the name North Incheon Nineteen. From what I could see on Wikipedia, the group didnt make it to the finals though. However, they signed to Evermore in 2015, where they changed their name to Voisper.

The group officially debuted in February 2016 with the song [In Your Voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcDIOpnJkes). In 2017, they made a splash in the ballad scene, performing on *Immortal Songs* a total of seven times that year. They had their first win on the show with their performance of Kim Kwang Suks [Letter to a Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf9lVwKr7Jk).

If youre a ballad person, I highly recommend you check their *Immortal Song* performances. I personally am a big fan of their performance of Park Hyo Shins [Snow Flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sgvkIaA2FM). I really wish theyd do more ballad because their vocals + harmonies are amazing.

Their most recent comeback was a digital single in early 2018 named [Missing U]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R4wdqRcWRI).

**[Astro (2nd) Photobook Project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_astro_02/)**

* Date Project Ends: May 31, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Astro?

Astro is very well known on this sub, so please check out their [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_(South_Korean_band\)) page for more thorough info on the group.

So quick summary time. Astro is a six-member group signed to Fantagio Music.

Before debut, the group trained together under the name iTeen Boys, which was Fantagios name for their male trainees. The group debuted in 2016 with the song [Hide &amp; Seek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEgSjGQEZnM).

While the group has a decent international following, they are still not that well known in Korea. The group is not in nugu territory by any means, but member Eunwoo is still pretty much the member most people can name immediately/know on sight.

On a brighter note, Id say in the past year or so, theyre slowly making their way into the bottom edges of B-tier dom. Their album sales have varied kinda wildly (on Gaon), but their best selling release was 2017s *Dream Part 1*, which sold 81,000+ copies via Gaon. 

The group also notably became known as the first aerobic boy band because of their double-gold medal wins two years in a row for their performances on Idol Star Athletic Championships. Their winning performances were [Pirates of the Caribbean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDG5a1fVEww) and [Elvis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKJYsUzTm1w&amp;t=223s) themed.

Theyve yet to have a title track chart on the Gaon charts, but their most recent single [CrazySexyCool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeUx0AN2kCA)"" charted at #11 on the US World charts.

There was some talk of the group being in danger once Fantagios new overlords took over recently, but I think things are looking up for them so I wouldnt count them out yet.

They also ran a successful Makestar for their [first photobook project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_astro/) in 2016.",11,51

1815,2018-04-21,2018,4,21,8,8drvtk,Interesting examples of text painting in kpop?,FineAppleDice,1524266156,"From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_painting):

&gt; Word painting (also known as tone painting or text painting) is the musical technique of composing music that reflects the literal meaning of a song's lyrics. 
&gt; For example, ascending scales would accompany lyrics about going up; slow, dark music would accompany lyrics about death.


Here are some that I noticed:

* **Gugudan - The Boots:**  Song builds up to sound more [vibrant &amp; flashier](https://youtu.be/y3KSD5sI0OM?t=45s) when the lyrics talk about become bolder and self-assured.

* **OMG - Windy Day:**
 This whole song is built from so much text painting &amp; associative imagery of varying wind levels to varying styles and tempo. E.g. the song slows down and soften just before the prechorus ^[1](https://youtu.be/AJqhKWo89FQ?t=21s), ^[2](https://youtu.be/AJqhKWo89FQ?t=1m45s) which matches the gentleness of the lyrics.



* **JJ Project - Icarus:** Poetically evoking Icarus' fall from flight (that is associated with pressures of failure &amp; refusal to give up) within this literal [beat drop](https://youtu.be/886u398k7AQ?t=40s).

* **SNSD - Express 999:** Very much like Windy Day with the level of imagery in the song. For example   the [ sudden style shifts of music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h5K6LbngJ0) conveys the ambivalent but shifting romantic feelings described in the lyrics.

* **IU- JamJam:** Maybe I'm super reaching with this one but Jam Jam (there is so much to say about this...) literally ends abruptly  with something that sounds like [a jar lid being closed after disrupting the lyrics](https://youtu.be/mHUPGYFRwxk?t=3m19s) *""Cover it up, spill it on top, once again""*. Wow.



I find this musical technique intriguing and I'm very curious what else others have found in their kpop adventures.

To Whom it May Concern,

The following is a colorful feature for those who wish to participate, put forth by the curators of Jukebox, both myself and the submitters whose songs have been chosen. The following songs were chosen from the visual sensation that the color evoked. 

""When I have found the relationship of all the tones the result must be a living harmony of tones, a harmony not unlike that of a musical composition.

Let us hope that the following songs indeed recall the harmonic space that music occupies in our rather dull lives.

To participate in this matter, please listen to one, two, or up to all seven of the following colors: 

   &gt; N! _[A freaking palette of colors because the song sounds colorful because of the light vocals/rap mixed with the deep electronic sounds!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uexk7jWXYmU)_ (RGB)

   &gt; Two. _[Red like a rose, exuding a bright, attractive energy that contrasts with its sharp, angry lyrics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpZj1vDoV5s)_ (CMYK)

  &gt; three. _[a soft, soothing blue. just like a calm sky, the song takes any stress away, relaxes and lulls the listener.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7cuMxmon8I)_ (WHITE)

  &gt; Four you, _[I'm thinking of pink and orange hues, just like the afternoon {which is fitting since this song's meant to represent the 'noon}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSm1eRvS_k0)_ (RGB)

  &gt; f i v e . _[F a d e d light blue. It's a sad song about not b e i n g with someone but still hopeful that s o m e d a y, you'll find a way to be with him/her.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1gpjO-JYs)
)_ (RGB)

  &gt; __S__I**X**. _[BlackandWhite, just like a barcode.The song makesyou relive both thegood and thebad,but pushes you to keep your chin up and move on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDeewpPQOK0)
)_ (GRAYSCALE)

  &gt; SeeN. _[A ViViD mixture of colors because she created the { UiVeRsE } y'all she wanted more color and she did just that!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FCYE87P5L0)_ (RGB)

Should you choose to participate, after listening to all seven colors, let your own creative colorful words form a review for the song, along with a score for it between 1 and 10. 

Thank you for your time and effort, and we hope to see further participation from you in the future.

Best of luck,

  Daisy

7. [LOO/HeeJin - ViViD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FCYE87P5L0)

As always, after youre done listening to a song or songs, leave a review as a reply to the comment with the song and title. Feel free to listen to all the songs or none of them at all. This week, instead of having one where you can review the MV, I decided that any of the songs that come with an MV can have the optional MV review as well  again, totally optional. The soft deadline for your reviews is 8:00 PM PST this Friday; since even sometimes I cannot hold myself to this deadline, its pretty flexible, just try to have them in before then!

Once again, I really apologize that this is being posted so late! I've had a busy day today so I've only gotten the chance to post this now. I really tried to post this earlier but stuff just coming up today, so I really am sorry if you were waiting for it to be on time. Sorry if I kept you waiting! Read the Other Business section! (when it gets posted FML) There's an apology gift for being tardy the past couple of weeks there. 

Really, really huge thank you to everyone who submitted! It was more submissions than I was expecting and I didn't realize so many people would submit songs, thank you so much! I had a ton of fun listening to all the songs you suggested and reading the blurbs/write-ups you all made. If I didn't choose your song, please don't be offended or sad! I really tried to have as much musical diversity/colorfulness on Jukebox this week and I really tried to have as much variety today as I could. Each submission was wonderful, so thank you all for taking the time to submit! 

Thanks for reviewing, have fun listening, and remember  life is more fun if you live it with some color :) ",36,38

1965,2018-04-23,2018,4,23,12,8e8nsj,Live stage background screens aren't more important than the idols/artists who are performing.,Wolf_Puppy,1524455510,"This is something that you probably have seen before: Often K-Pop live stages have those giant screens in the background playing animated graphics, and they take up all the allotted details the video compression algorithm can use, and the actual idols/artists end up just a smeary/blurry mess. This happens because the video compression is trying to retain the details of each of those giant visible pixels/LED dots on those background screens, thus using up all the allotted details for each frame, while in comparison the people have less distinct sharp edges like all those pixels/dots, so they get less priority in the compression.

Any time when live stages don't use those background screens (for example, using props or a simpler background instead), the video is much cleaner and contains far more detail.

I have grown to hate live stages with those background screens. I wish they'd stop using them altogether. But that's never going to happen, and the cameraman has to set the camera's aperture small enough so those animated graphics can be seen clearly, which then will show every single one of those giant pixels/LED dots, requiring them to be rendered by the video compression algorithm.

I have to wonder if the S. Korean broadcasting networks are aware of this problem, and if so, do they care? What can be done to remedy this problem? ",33,156

As such, might as well kick off the hype train with my DREAMCATCHER ALBUM GIVEAWAY EXTRAVAGANZA! 
_______________________________________________________________

**If you read any of my previous giveaway posts, this section is all the same, so feel free to skip it**

Before I get into the giveaway, a little backstory into why I am doing this giveaway:

I have always been someone who strongly believes in supporting the groups you love financially.  As such, in the past, I have purchased a number of albums from my favorite groups whenever they have a comeback.  I buy even more albums from rookie groups because I believe they could use the most support.  

The only ""problem"" with this is that I end up with a ton of copies of albums that just take up space.  I have given the albums I have purchased in the past away to people, but it turns out that shipping is REALLY expensive, especially if its going international.  The solution I have found to all of this is to just give away brand new albums.  I get to support my favorite groups and give away albums without having to pay for double shipping.  I will keep one album for my collection and give the rest away via a random draw.  I have given up collecting PCs, so thats not a problem either.  Enjoy your free PCs!

____________________________________________________

**New info starts here, start reading again!**

Now, to get to the giveaway.  This is how things will work:

I will be giving away **20** brand new, unopened Dreamcather ""To be named later"" albums.  The albums will be shipped to you from the distributor, I will never touch them.

To enter into the giveaway, all you have to do is post a comment below stating two things:

*As the version info has not been released yet, I will just ask the winners what version they would like after the drawing*

1.  What is your favorite Dreamcatcher song so far and why?

2. What is your favorite Dreamcatcher cover and why?

I WILL be checking the profiles of the winners to make sure they are not brand new accounts or people who dont regularly contribute to r/kpop.  This helps me weed out potential scammers.  If you are not super active, thats okay.  If you have an account that is decently old and you do contribute to the sub at times, you will be eligible. 

I will leave the entries open for a few weeks and draw the winners near the release date.  Winners will be drawn randomly with no consideration given to your bias or why you like the group.  

If you win, I will contact you via PM asking for your name and address.  Obviously, you must be willing to provide this information.  If you are not comfortable doing so, please do not enter.  Your private info will not be shared and no one will see it but me.
________________________________________________________

And now for the real talk.

Please understand this is a giveaway, winners are literally getting free, brand new albums.  If there is a problem with shipping, a delay, lost package, or anything else, it is YOUR responsibility to contact me letting me know there is an issue.  I will then follow up with the website.  If you dont tell me there is a problem, I cant help you.  If there is an issue with shipping, thats on either the shipping merchant or your country's customs.  In the unfortunate situation that an album gets lost in the mail, I am so sorry, but I will not be replacing it.

If this giveaway goes smoothly, I will do more in the future for other groups I plan to buy albums for.  Ways to keep this from happening are winners being rude should a problem arise.  If there is a delay in purchase, shipping, or anything else, I promise you you will get your album at some point.  If you are rude about anything that goes wrong, its a great way to prevent giveaways like this in the future.  Remember, you are getting free merch, I am not obligated to give anything away.  Please respect that.

While there is no way for me to enforce this but, **PLEASE do NOT enter this giveaway if you are planning to purchase this album anyways**.  That defeats the whole purpose of the giveaway.  This giveaway is not designed to make your album collecting cheaper.  Ideally, winners should be people who were not planning on buying the album in the first place, whether they do not have the funds for it, or they are undecided if they want to commit that much to the group.  

This is also not a giveaway so you can re-sell the album for profit.  Trust me, its a lot of work for you for very little gain, so please just dont even try.  Please let the albums go to people who really want them.

**NEW RULES**

DO NOT link this giveaway on Twitter just so people who dont contribute to /r/kpop can try and get free albums.  This happened with the Stray Kids giveaway and to be 100% transparent, some people did get drawn with new accounts and next to no post history, and their slot was redrawn.  This giveaway is for the /r/kpop community and is not a free handout to people who dont contribute here.

*As an aside to my normal post, I just want to say that all my giveaways so far have gone very smoothly and the winners have all been very kind and gracious, so I would like to thank each and every one of them for that!*
________________________________________

There are currently no restrictions on entry.  I will ship to anywhere in the world for this giveaway.  Should I experience problems with a particular country's customs, I may change this policy for future giveaways.

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.  Have fun!

**I am not restricting the giveaways for those who have won any giveaways in the past.  As such, feel free to enter even if you have already won a giveaway.  The reason I am not restricting the contests is because I dont want people to have to pick and choose which groups contests they enter for fear of winning a contest now and not being able to win another specific contest later.  And just so people know I am not kidding, I can confirm there is one person who has already won 2 giveaways.**

*Lastly, I really really hate to do this because I think asking for upvotes is in really bad taste, but since this is a 20 album giveaway, I really would like as many people to have a shot at it as possible.  If you could make sure to upvote this post at least enough to get on the front page of /r/kpop for visibility, I would greatly appreciate it!  We had some struggles in this area with the Stray Kids giveaway.*",187,206
2025,2018-04-24,2018,4,24,1,8ecvn6,What do you think of the new artists and girl groups formed post-IOI disbandment?,thestormkraken,1524501799,"It's been a while since the nation's girl group disbanded and recently, all 11 members had a reunion. I'm not sure if this is still a sensitive topic among IOI fans in this sub but I was wondering what you guys think of the individual and their respective group's future after the disbandment.

Personally, I think everyone who thought that some members would be a flop after IOI is wrong. I'd like to point out Mina for example, although she is presumably living under Sejeong's shadows just like all the other gugudan members, she's surprisingly doing well as a music show MC and in terms of brand reputation, her rank nowadays even beats Sejeong's. She will also star in a drama alongside a popular boy group member as I recall. This is considering how she was perceived by many as the least popular member of IOI during the course of their last promotions. WJSN's Yeonjung is doing well in her group as well, although not too much may be associated to her individual activities, it's still a relief that the name WJSN seems to have a brighter future ahead. Meanwhile, Pristin's Nayoung and Jieqiong, even being the leader and the visual respectively, did not receive too much recognition while in IOI as compared to the recognition they got after debuting as Pristin. The group won rookie of the year, with Jieqiong being a mentor in China's Idol Producer. I think Nayoung also became a cover for a magazine not too long ago. As a group, I personally think Pristin would be most successful musically, not only because their songs are self-produced by the members, but also because their type of music is well suited to the new generation. This also goes for Weki Meki, although both their name and gugudan's throw off some new prospective listeners, Weki Meki's music is surprisingly good. I also think that the other WeMe members are interesting enough that it would not be much of a hard carry for Yoojung and Doyeon for their part, as much as Sejeong sadly does with gugudan. Doyeon and Yoojung seems to have the most stable and friendlier fanbase that does not alienate other members may it be from IOI or Weki Meki. Their individual activites are also doing well, especially Doyeon who recently collaborated with another singer as far as I remember. As for Chungha, I think she is the most successful so far in terms of music releases. She is well-supported with good management, her songs ranks high digitally, and her activites as a radio DJ as well as being constantly invited to TV shows and such marks her current relevance. I think she will definitely reach a peak though, where we will all be in awe at how popular she's become. I think I need not go into detail on the individual success Chaeyeon and Sejeong got even after IOI, although both their respective groups are still struggling musically to be known. Both have several CFs, and a promising future for an acting career. Sejeong is still a variety cheat key, now working with Yoo Jae Suk. I still can't even believe Sejeong collaborated for a Station in SM. She is really walking the flowery path way ahead. I think gugudan has a potential to rise sometime, just with a proper song. However, DIA's name in my opinion, would be remembered, but will really struggle to become relevant in the industry as a group. As for Sohye and Somi, I feel like Sohye's success is already pre-determined, and I don't think she needed fame that much to succeed any further. It would be an exaggeration to say that her mere existence still makes her relevant, but I also think that for some reason its really true. She will definitely not be forgotten even if she does not pursue the idol career. I still doubt Somi's career though, if JYP chooses not to debut her in an idol group soon. Although the girl is widely loved by the public and her visuals as well as talent is no joke, I just feel uncertain of her future. Nevertheless, I think she would be popular, given the proper circumstances, and I'm 90% sure she could even surpass the fame she had during IOI, something that I am still in doubt happening to the other girl's groups during the long run. More or less, I think it was better for them individually when IOI disbanded, as they were each given the promotion and spotlight simultaneously. Yeonjung, however for me, stood out more individually in IOI, albeit the controversies she faced during their promotions compared to her standing in WJSN right now.

I'm sorry for the long post and the bad english. I also want to hear the thoughts on this sub as well.

TLDR; Members post-IOI was not that tragic as everyone thought it would be, I think their future standing will make IOI look like the Avengers soon.",6,0

Hello, and welcome to the Snuper Artist Spotlight!


&amp;nbsp;

In honor of their comeback, Ive decided to make this spotlight post all about Snuper. I was inspired by the other great ones Ive seen around, so I wanted to make my own for my ultimate bias group. Ive seen quite a few people around r/kpop that enjoy their discography, but know nothing about the members, so this post aims to change that. Snuper is a group of really fun, hardworking, and dorky guys that you won't regret following!

#**INTRO**  

[**Snuper**](https://imgur.com/a/RHHUq) is a six-member boy group from **Widmay Entertainment** that debuted in November **2015**. They are the first and only idol group to come from Widmay, a company that houses actors (Lee Kiwoo, Hong Jonghyun, etc.). Snuper consists of six members, Taewoong, Suhyun, Sangil, Woosung, Sangho, and Sebin. Their group name means being something much greater than super and their goal to become supermen in the lives of their fans. Their greeting is Higher than super!. Snupers fans are called **Swings** (S + wings), because the fans are what allow them to soar. Theyve experienced steady growth since their debut, with their first mini album selling less than 1,000 copies, to their most recent Korean album selling well over 20,000. They've also promoted in Japan, beginning in 2016 with the Japanese repackage of Compass.

#**DISCOGRAPHY:**

Snuper is known for a distinct retro sound, thanks to their repeat partnership with Sweetune.
Ive listed all of their releases in order. With each song Ive linked the music video, dance practice, and a stage of my choice. Ive also linked the B-Sides! All of their B-sides are great, but my personal favorites are Please Don't and My Girl's Fox! Their new release, Tulips, is from a different producer, and shows a new side of them!

#**VIDEOS:**

I tried to include as many of their appearances as I could remember and find! I compiled this Spotlight totally on my own, so please forgive me if there is anything missing (also lmk so I can add it ^^). There are likely more out there though! As a fan, I'd suggest rooting through their VLIVE, as well as checking out the selection I have at the very bottom of this post.

&amp;nbsp;

###**VLIVE**  

Their [official VLIVE](http://channels.vlive.tv/F141BD/video) has all of Snuper's own videos starting from the Compass era. Quite a few of the videos have English subtitles, but not all of them. Snuper goes live only occasionally, but when they do it's usually the members playing games, goofing around, eating, or just chatting with fans. The majority of their uploads mirror those on Snuper's YouTube channel.

&amp;nbsp;

**Snuper Film:**

[Snuper Film](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF-xQoc-h7z44jfmwrG6gt-cu_D-kZaz-) follows Snuper as they go through promotions! It appears that this series is the conglomerate and successor of their former video 'types', combining vlogs, behind the scenes, and more structured videos under one name. The first season ended last month.
The more recent episodes are now getting English subs from Widmay on their YouTube channel. The subs usually appear within a week of posting.


&amp;nbsp;

**Snuper Self Cam:** 

This ongoing series is vlog style and follows the members during their promotions! There are 5 seasons so far, each filmed during one comeback cycle. A full YouTube playlist can be found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF-xQoc-h7z6g7xBZjMReRIH5uX2iArC2). Episodes from season 1 and 2 are unsubbed, since Snuper got a VLive account after these were already filmed.  
Season 3 and onwards have English subtitles, all on their [official VLive](http://channels.vlive.tv/F141BD/video)! 

&amp;nbsp;

**Snuper's Real V**

This show was hosted shortly after the Shall We? promotions ended on the IDOL X IDOL VLIVE channel, before Snuper got a VLIVE of their own.  
Episodes: [ [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S64hr0zoUw) | [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=330rnCRK08E) | [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyLTcGmNFK0) | [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st50q0vrIxI) ] 
     
&amp;nbsp;

**Snuper Project**

This show was hosted by MBC and revolves around granting the fans' wishes! They also carry out different games and missions.  
Episodes: RAW[ [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwJ5fUIv6qw) | [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQpt9a-REW0) | [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgdepOYb-Es) | [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTCip_a1kU) | [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vemyv7a33k0) ]    

&amp;nbsp;

**K-RUSH**  
This episode follows Snuper to beautiful Paju, where they take charming photos, take a scenic bike ride, visit the set of drama Descendants of the Sun, and more!

Wu has starred in films includingXxX: Return of Xander Cage, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, andJourney to the West: The Demons Strike Back. Hes set to appear in Wong Kar\-wais upcoming filmBlossoms.

In making the announcement, Grainge said, Kris is an incredibly talented recording artist, songwriter, actor and entrepreneur. Im thrilled that Kris is joining the UMG family and honored that we will have the opportunity to build upon his remarkably successful career.

Kris Wu said,Its my pleasure to be part of this collaboration with Universal Music Group. Im enjoying the time to share creative and vision of my music.

Chang said, We are thrilled to partner with Kris and our sister companies to launch new global hit songs from Kris, who is a genuine musical talent. As one of the industrys top producers and singer\-songwriters, Kris has global ambitions and hes fluent in Mandarin, English and Korean, allowing him to uniquely overcome any language barrier. As China grows into one of the worlds biggest music markets, Universal Music China will continue to develop Kris Wu as well as the very best Chinese talent and position its artists for success both in the local market and across the globe.

2326,2018-04-26,2018,4,26,21,8f2dnz,Kard concert in Melbourne,Nemrodd,1524747031,"Tonight Kard was doing a concert in Melbourne and I was there with my glorious category 3 ticket (/s). I feel like retelling the concert for those of you interested by my fan account.
The MCs were SBS Pop Asia Kevin and Andy.

I'll just retell it as I write up the setlist:

* [Into You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX91IS9c86k) ; a really good first song imo, it gave me goosebumps, I was admittedly really excited about the concert since it's my first time attending a kpop concert!
* [You And Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz23WFb8HM0) ; that I [poorly recorded](https://youtu.be/VyKFTxS-bmU) if you're interested.
* [Trust Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADfFxRvup0c) (the four of them together)
* [Don't Recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Dp7Q-SM1Y)
* [Rumor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LPjJ1p4dYs)

Q&amp;A time. They all picked one question in a bowl and either read it (BM), funnily attempted to read it (J.Seph) or passed it to BM for reading and translating (Somin). After that Somin and J.Seph went backstage to prepare for their solos and BM and Jiwoo had a few more questions. I don't remember most of them, only one that BM read:
 ""When you top the music charts and win on music shows for two weeks in a row, what will you do to celebrate?"" to which he answered ""I didn't think that far..."" haha.

* Somin solo cover of [Taeyeon's Fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHXUM-6a3dU)
* J.Seph's solo cover of some hiphop song I didn't know (sorry)
* Jiwoo's solo cover of [Winner's Really Really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tBnF46ybZk)
* BM's solo cover of some hiphop song I again didn't know. 
* Somin &amp; Jiwoo cover of [Ariana Grande's Side to Side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXiSVQZLje8), joined after the first chorus by BM and J.Seph for the rest of the song. I recorded it (poorly again) but it's still uploading.
* Group cover of [Bruno Mars' 24K Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqyT8IEBkvY)

At that point (or was it after the solos?) they made four fans (selected by seat number before the concert) come up on stage and ""play a game"" to get rewards from Kard. They had to choose a member and then roll a giant inflated dice and get a gift from the selected member based on the number they rolled. 

* The first girl got a signed album handed to her by BM (+ a quick hug). 
* The second one chose Jiwoo and won a chance to take a polaroid picture with her right then. She ended up taking the picture with all four members. 
* The 3rd guy got a recorded wakeup message by Somin. He asked for her to say ""Hello sexy"" or something like that but she ended up recording ""Hello sweetie, have a nice day oppa!"" amongst the shouts of the public on the words ""sweetie"" and ""oppa"" (he also had a quick hug).
* Finally, the 4th girl got a serenade sung to her by J.Seph while he held her hand (+ a quick hug yet again)

Last part of the concert:

* [Push and Pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-apYbGYNBk)
* [Hola Hola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USx4WyrkfU4)
* [Oh NaNa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPTcKSVAEvA) (encore)
* [Living Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRVTV7688sw)

It was a really cool first kpop concert and I enjoyed it a lot. They were all really good, especially BM and Somin imo. Somin's live singing was incredible and BM was just so energetic and confident for interacting with the public!

2490,2018-04-29,2018,4,29,1,8fkt0l,The first /r/kpop Banner Bonanza 2018,alleybetwixt,1524931422,"Hello, /r/kpop!

We'd like to try something new around here in regards to our subreddit's visuals. Three times a year (every four months) we will hold a Banner Bonanza. 

Our Master of Headers /u/AnOddName has less time to dedicate to banner business, which is what happens when one has a life. I, /u/alleybetwixt, don't really have a life. Thusly, I will be committing myself to this project. Aesthetic beauty and iconography in music videos are central to our experience of Kpop, so we want our subreddit to reflect that. We could have a few dedicated users make *all* the headers, but I think it's way more fun to give everyone a chance to participate and contribute their ideas.

A new banner shows each time you refresh the subreddit. We have space for roughly 25 banners to be in continuous rotation at any given time. We are looking to get 10-15... more or less during this round. We'll see how it goes!

**How to participate!**

**A. Make a banner with the following considerations:** 

* Ideal dimensions: **1920px wide** by **223px tall** (minimum height)
* Hitting that 1920px width is more important than the height. I can help adjust or crop your banner to our exact needs.
* We prefer using shots from music videos that *don't* include people or recognizable faces. We get the most positive feedback for the headers with bright colors, interesting set designs, or artsy/iconic scenes.
* What **NOT** to submit: Group shots of idols standing around: [[1](http://i.imgur.com/yVly5ew.jpg)], [[2](http://i.imgur.com/h6yYqG9.jpg)], [[3](http://i.imgur.com/K5uUPET.jpg)].
* Use our [Master List](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/headerimages) (linked in the sidebar at the bottom of Features) for inspiration and reference. Please check to make sure we have not already made a banner from the same shot as the one you wish to submit.
* We would prefer imagery from recent music videos (within the last few months), but you are welcome to choose something older. Keep in mind the quality of much older videos won't look as crisp as newer videos. Again use the Master List for reference.

**B. Suggest a music video you think would make a great header**

* Provide a screenshot or link with an exact timestamp to the relevant image. Remember the dimensions are very long and narrow. Something that looks great in a full screenshot may look very strange when it has been cropped.
* We can create the banner for you if it looks promising and you will be credited in the master list. (I will peruse comments and help do this, but others are also welcome to help out their fellow redditors if you think they have a good idea.  Helpers may also be credited for putting that work in.)

**C. Comment, upvote, and give feedback!**

* Do you like a banner someone submitted? Show your support with upvotes and compliments.
* Is there a banner we already have in rotation you want us to keep?
* Is there a banner we have in rotation you can't stand? (Be respectful to the user who created it, please!)

Hopefully we can get a new set of headers more frequently with this system so we can keep things fresh!

**Last notes:**

* [The PSY banner](https://i.imgur.com/icemB03.jpg) is probably going to stick around. I feel strange saying this because I'm the one who created it ages ago, but a number of redditors and members of the mod team have expressed a desire to keep it. \\\_()_/
* Do you think doing this three times a year is a good idea? Too frequent? Not frequent enough?
* **AT ANY TIME**  /r/kpop users are welcome to PM me with their headers. Instructions and a link to message me are provided at the bottom of the [Master List](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/headerimages). Or you can save up your banners for the next Banner Bonanza!

**Happy header-ing!**",95,121

Hello, and welcome to this weeks special edition of Jukebox! Instead of me choosing the songs or the songs being randomly chosen, u/araw_anim has gotten the opportunity to choose seven songs for everyone to listen to this Jukebox instead. If you are wondering why  for the 30th edition, which was a special theme, the person who could guess the theme would get to pick the songs for this Jukebox, and u/araw_anim indeed guessed the theme correctly  Eeveelutions!

Here are the songs chosen this week!

1. [DAY6 - I Need Somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87a47NhL8VM) 
2. [LOONA/Gowon &amp; Chuu - Seesaw (feat. Kim Lip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XrQKK7z7DU)
3. [NUEST - Look (a starlight night)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy-95NwncgM) 
4. [JBJ - On My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6IPAlXuD6E) 
5. [Red Velvet - Kingdom Come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJEAMow2A4o) 
6. [EXO - The Eve ( ())](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZt1Nt2vWXM) 
7. [BTS - Whalien 52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5x3vQZjalM)

As always, listen to each song, and then leave a review of the song as a reply to the comment with the songs artist and title. Along with your review, please leave a score between 1 and 10. Since all the songs are B-sides this week, instead of an MV review for a song, were going to do something special; if one of the songs listed here has a comeback stage or dance practice associated with it, youre allowed to review that as well and keep that in mind with your review. I would encourage you to focus on the song, but youre free to talk about those topics as well, since theres no MV for anything this week and I still want to give you all the chance to talk as much about the visual experience with the auditory experience that the music comes with.

If you were wondering about why theres no wiki update this week: I unfortunately have been really busy this week and I dont have time to update it, and Im out of town this weekend (hence why Im posting this now, since its the only time I can actually post this). Sorry if this much-earlier-than-posting threw you off!

I think I'm fairy okay at dancing? I've been dancing since I was young, so I can move my body? Lol.

My singing is average too, although I like doing more of ""opera like singing"". Haha. 

If I go I would probably sign up for dancing. Although I'm scared since SM requires you to freestyle. o.o

Is anyone else planning on attending? :D",22,71

Sweet DreMs cracks me up (I just about held it together when the gang first showed up, but lost my shit entirely when Soo Geun appears!)

Can anyone tell me what theyre saying in the acting bits - havent been able to find this out. Specifically Id like to know:


Sweet Dreams:

1) What do the text messages say?

2) What are Ho Dong and the others saying when Heechul wakes up in the classroom?

3) What is written on the desk (I can hazard a guess but still...)


Falling Blossoms:

1) The beginning scene with Heechul, Kyung Hoon and Mi-Sun (before the song starts) and the scene in the middle when Heechul comes home after being attacked.

Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.
Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. Word for word if it is necessary.
Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. The most upvoted video, Ill translate...within .....decent length....

2. I dont know how many videos Ill get..so I can only promise first top 5 will definitely be done, and others will be...based on time constraint

3. Leave a link and what you would like to get out of it. BAD EXAMPLE: can you find a clip and translate where Idol XXX was talking about this?  (uuhh NOPE!) GOOD EXAMPLE: This clip (with link), i am curious to what XXX is saying in general

4. If possible, a official clip is preferred. Mostly because I can definitely hear better.

5. One request per person please.
