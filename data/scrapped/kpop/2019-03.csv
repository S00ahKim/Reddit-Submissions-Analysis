I've picked out a few songs to try this year, but none of them are as suited to my voice as ""Lie"" was.  I've tried searching for songs in the same key, but I don't really know that much about how keys work so I'm sort of guessing. If I could have suggestions of other singers with a similar range to Jimin, or other songs in a key close to ""Lie"" (which I think is F major) that would be really helpful. 

So far I've been looking at songs by Park Won, Gaho, and Wheesung.

#### New Mod Applications

It's that time of the year. Spring is around the corner and around this time we normally add more people to the moderator team. We could really use some extra help.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for:

* **Experienced with reddit and /r/kpop**: We are looking for experienced redditors with an account that is at least 1 year old. We also prefer users who have contributed productively to this community whether that be with submissions or just thoughtful comments.

* **A firm interest in K-Pop and the subreddit**: We want people that are knowledgeable and interested, so obviously you need to be a fan of K-Pop.  You should also have a desire to make r/kpop a better subreddit and be engaged in discussions like Town Hall.

* **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators**: You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our discord, modmail, and backroom sub, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members.

* **Free time**: You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to carry out moderating duties.

* **Thick skin**: K-Pop fans love to promote and discuss their favs. When they are not allowed to do so because of our rules they can get rather salty.  So be prepared to shrug that off.

* **BONUS POINTS**: We need extra help between the hours of 10AM - 6PM UTC (7PM - 3AM KST). If you are available and have access to moderate from a PC during those hours, please apply.  It not required that you have these hours available to get accepted, but anyone who does will be given an extra close look. We are also looking for an individual that is fluent in the Korean language to help with some of our projects. This individual should be able to converse in an informal and formal situation in Korean.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of the responsibilities of being a mod include:

* Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
* Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
* Enforce the subreddit rules.

&amp;nbsp;

##### [APPLY HERE](https://goo.gl/forms/zyR216lI5AuLBxmo2)

&amp;nbsp;

The application has several open-ended questions.  Take the time to answer them.  As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered.  You don't need to write an essay, but you'll need to put some effort into them.  None of the answers will disqualify you, so please be honest and accurate with your responses.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Time-stamping issue for album discussions and audio submissions

We are going to ban the usage of full album links hosted on YouTube for album discussion threads and audio-only submissions to the subreddit. For the following submissions, sometimes it's convenient for the OP to use a Youtube video with the whole album (full, mini, or single) compiled into one video. They make their links to each track with time-stamps, which advance you to the relevant starting point of each song on the album.

&amp;nbsp;

The reasons as to why we would like to remove these links:

* We want to avoid situations if the video is taken down and the subject of the album discussion is gone. Therefore, making the submission unusable.
* We want to remove time-stamping to link to individual songs within the album video.
* We want to avoid a situation for people with bad/slow connections that have to load the whole album video to listen to an individual track.
* The time-stamping method does not work for every platform or app, which makes these links tricky or impossible to navigate for some users of this subreddit.

&amp;nbsp;

For these reasons (and a few other related frustrations), we ask that all album discussion posts and audio-only single track posts use Youtube links that only contain one track each. Any future incidences of using the time-stamping method will be removed.

We have already started enforcing this with removals or asking for replacement links. We're grateful to those users who have complied ahead of this Town Hall.

&amp;nbsp;

#### User Flairs and an expansion on Link Flairs

User flairs are a privilege. If you misuse user flairs, we will force you to re-flair. And if you change your flair back after being re-flaired, that could be grounds for further action such as being banned from the subreddit.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the subreddit has 21 link flairs. We would like to float the idea of expanding the Teaser flair from being an all encompassing flair that covers image and video teasers to two flairs designating the type of teaser it is.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Teaser -&gt; Image Teaser | Video Teaser

&amp;nbsp;

We are also open to adding new link flairs to help with categorizing content better.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Quality translations

We want to stress the existence of Rule 2.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Include English Translations - Articles that are entirely in Korean must include a full English translation or detailed summary in the comments. Single-line or Twitter translations are not sufficient. Machine translations (Google, Bing, Naver, etc.) are not permitted. Please complete the translation before posting and add it immediately to avoid the submission being removed. If you are unable to translate yourself, please submit an English-language article instead.

There have been instances this past month in which the translation provided in a submission is using machine translation (i.e. Google) or an incomplete translation from Twitter. Rule 2 stresses that if a proper/complete translation is not available, the user should submit an English-language article.

To hopefully combat the possibility of bad translations in user submitted content, we want to establish a translation task force. The task force would be using Reddit chat which would include translators and subreddit moderators. If the task force finds a mistranslated article, they can tell the moderators that it's a wrong translation. And if the subreddit moderators want clarification in regards to a translation posted in a user submission, we can ask the task force if it's correct.

The translation task force is essentially a hotline for subreddit moderators and users who are fluent in Korean to help us keep the quality of submissions on the subreddit to a higher standard.
&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.

Im planning on hosting a group order for European blinks when blackpink releases their full album (because we never/rarely get any group orders for smaller countries here ;-;). Since EMS will be dependent on the number of people and the album will be a standard cost, I want to lower shipping cost from my country to blinks as much as possible. So I wanted to know what others experience with these go since I usually order after the song is released and by then all the group orders are closed. 

Is 25-27 total cost (album + korea to eu + eu to blink) okay? Is that too much? Albums I pay for with shipping total at 20 but if I can get my album in less than 2 weeks instead of 3-4 weeks and with my choice of photocards then the extra 5/7 doesnt seems bad? Idk sorry i dont have a lot of experience with this stuff ;-; i just want to help my girlies and I dont want any fans to experience anything bad because of me",1,1

Every once in a while I stumble across some performance that I was crazy about when it first came out, but eventually just sort of forgot about. Finding them again is always a delight, but I know there are so many out there that I missed entirely.

Note - I'm not really looking for ""iconic"" performances here, and especially not looking for music show performances no matter how great they were. I'm looking for those special stages, covers with a unique twists, powerful solo stages, things that were only done once.

Examples:

* [Ryeowook -   on Immortal Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyhQyNxnKHA) choreographed by Shindong

* [Onew and Luna - Because I'm a girl on Idol Star Trot Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWLD-7TUR1o)

111,2019-03-02,2019,3,2,15,awenyz,"Fans of older kpop groups, are you jealous of younger groups and their popularity?",Kittaem,1551506779,"Now let me preface this saying that I know popularity is not the most important factor in an artist's career. There are so many more important things worth praising and although older groups may lose the fanatic popularity they once had when they were younger, they gain stability, more creative control, and overall recognition. 

However, when I'm a fan of a group, I always wish the best for them. Music show awards, high MV views, public recognition, great sales, etc. So sometimes I can't help but feel disappointed when the popularity of veterin idols begin to decline, or at least it seems to when in comparison to younger, trendier groups. Obviously there are other factors that can lead to the disparity in numbers and recognition, but it's also not a reach to say that young fans naturally gravitate towards groups they perceive to be closer to their age.

So fans of 1st to 2nd gen idols, I'd like to hear your stories. Did you ever experience such ""jealousy""? How did you overcome it?",140,63

That is insane! I thought most idols were rich, never thought of it this way.

Someone in the thread then explained that it's probably for business connections/collabs etc. Which makes a look of sense now. 


Jun dropped a Chinese solo a couple months ago. That was very unexpected, especially seeing as this wasn't like a special presentation during a concert or something, it was just a digital single and again, he was definitely not the member people would've thought of when thinking of dropping a solo suddenly.

The Reddit post must get less than 10 comments, not including replies

The artist must've debuted in 2017 or later

They must be unknown on this sub. Many people are widely known by r/kpop but people just don't care about them. I will only include artists without a lot of buzz or awareness.

Also, I have started describing the concepts of the songs to hopefully help people find something they're looking for. If you think my description is inaccurate, let me know what you think would be better.

If you are a fan of any of these artists, share your knowledge. Post other songs people should check out or variety clips. This spotlight is supposed to get these groups more fans, so if you can, help out with that.

Finally, if there was a release that I've missed comment or DM me and I will add it.

Enjoy these new releases.

I discovered Kpop is 2010, when I was seven years old. From the age of eight to sixteen, Kpop was my life. I loved listening to the music, watching the music videos, and learning more about Korean culture. I never reached a point where I wanted to learn Korean or move to Korea like I saw so many of my fellow Kpop fans do, but the effect Kpop had on my life was astounding. I never realized that I felt such deep feelings towards Kpop until January 2019. I read news that one of my favorite idols, whom I shipped with a group member, was dating the idol that I hated the most. I had an anxiety attack and had heart palpitations for over two weeks. This incident is laughable now, and you might even think my life is pathetic for this. But then, at the moment, I felt so many emotions and was so strongly affected by something that had no real effect on my actual life that it was clear to me that I was time to end this obsession. Prior to this incident, there were some other events that hinted to me that my love for Kpop was getting out of hand. I felt like I was superior to fans who had started listening to Kpop in like 2016 because of BTS and even started to disassociate myself with Kpop fans who were crazy when I was just like them. My best friend, who was Korean (a coincidence, I swear), would tell me how uncomfortable she felt when people would start speaking to her in Korean, calling her unnie, and asking her about Kpop. While I had never done any of those things and had always hidden my obsession with Kpop (even when I had first started listening to Shinee, SNSD, and Bigbang around 2010-11), I felt embarrassed that I and so many others had such strong reactions to Kpop. At that point (around 2016), I had started to distance myself from major Kpop groups and friends who were fans. I started listening to underrated artists and appreciate music for what it was, an art. Even then, I felt superior to those who were fans of popular and overrated artists, such as TWICE, BLACKPINK, and BTS. As I have grown as a person and matured, I have learned that Kpop isnt for me. The fandom culture, the drama, and obsession simply does not have a place in my life anymore.

I have reached points where I have become so obsessed and hateful towards idols and fans that it has scared me. I never went to the internet to write hateful things about anyone, but it was so internalized that everytime I would see a certain idol and their group, I would feel so annoyed and it would affect me for hours. I truly believed that a certain ship was real and thought of them as a real couple; I followed accounts that supported them, read fanfictions about them, and watched fancams from concerts and reality tv shows showing them being romantic towards one another. When I first read the news, I was truly heartbroken. I felt like someone had broken up with me and cried for hours on end. I knew it was wrong for me to feel this way, because these idols had their own lives and should not have to think about what they do. During this incident, I read proof from other shippers and fans that the relationship was not real and that this person had sacrificed themself for the sake of their real relationship. I know, saying that now makes me realize how crazy I was being lol. I had even reached a point when I felt hopeless because my favorite company was not doing as well as they were before. I felt like I wasnt a good fan and felt so much hatred towards other groups/companies that did not have to work hard but got everything handed to them. Yes, there are people in the Kpop industry who are not appreciated enough despite their talent, hard work, and charisma. That being said, those who are successful are not to be blamed for this. The Kpop Industry has flaws, some that are obvious (colorism, body positivity) and some that are not so obvious (the impact of brand name  companies, looks &gt; talent). Im not here to criticize the industry and its fans though; Im simply saying that I have grown up with Kpop and decided to leave that part of me behind.

I stopped listening to Kpop for two weeks after this incident and deactivated my Instagram that was dedicated to Kpop. I started discovering music that I truly loved listening to and art that I appreciated. Kpop has this amazing power to bring people together and heal people, but it can also hurt and divide people. I have grown and left this part of my life behind, but that doesnt mean that everyone has to. I just hope that my opinion and history might help someone who is in the same place I was and is considering leaving the Kpop fandom.",9,0

Almost like every bit of their personality gets treated like they are some sort of alien specie who needs to be put under a magnificent glass to analyse every little detail of them. It makes me uncomfortable how much they talk about certain idols, everyday they tweet about how much they miss certain idol even though they frequently post at fancafes and social media accounts. People started to analyse every bit of idol faces with the new ""anatomy of x"" too which feels really creepy to me. Idols are humans just like rest of us so what's the reason people feel like they have to obsess too much over them even though most of their personality bits and facial/body features are pretty regular human like? 

I'm not talking about people who are fans of groups/idols just the ones that can't stop talking about their idols every hour and carry thousands of gifs/pictures of them.",23,0

And sometimes it seems like ppl are almost scared to say they are army or blinks for example why you care so much about the fandom and it's reputation? We all could just like whatever we want and be proud of it. Just because there are some stupid ppl in the fandom it doesn't mean the whole fandom is bad. These popular groups just have more of them bc they have the most intrest and ppl know that by mentioning these groups they know they will get clout. Everyone knows that when i say something bad about BTS armys will attack and i will get lot of clicks. That behaviour is toxic and we should stop doing that but i guess ppl are such stupid bc we all love that one minute of fame in the end",4,0

I also hated SNSD's early Japanese releases like Mr. Taxi and Paparazzi at the same and found the videos tacky but I just listened to them recently and now they're among my favorite of their discography.

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Anything else is fair game, no matter how trivial or silly.  Remember, you can ask your K-pop questions any day of the week over at r/kpophelp.

Intro: Singularity - BTS
The Lullaby - Roy Kim
Hug - Seventeen 
With You - The Rose
The Snowman - Jung Seung Hwan
The Voice - Jung Seung Hwan
The Weight - Sam Kim

What is special about these song choices is that they never 'peak'; the music and vocals never crescendo or get too loud. ('The Snowman' is my one exception). For the most part, the songs stay soft and even throughout. Perfect for falling asleep to.

The main thing you all need to know is that I, and the majority of the crowd, paid less than $40 for this concert. Forgive me if I forget/mix up details as usual, but... my god.

I've stanned SNSD since 2014 (when I spiraled into this realm) and they're one of the main reasons why I am the way I am today, listening to k-pop everyday and now sharing Fan Accounts like these for the world to see. I sorta cooled off with my GG stanning over time since new groups were coming in and GG weren't as active in recent years as before. When Tiffany announced she was touring and coming here, I was pretty excited, but skeptical given how many songs she had at the time. Then I saw the price and was all in. Grabbed 2 tickets the day they went on sale (also luckily grabbed that 2nd one before they sold out because my friend slept in and I learned not to buy tickets separately ever) and was prepared for this day to come.

#Prior to concert
Friend and I met up at Union station, we went on a good ol walk to Korean Grill House for some kbbq (run by Chinese people). Basically played chef's role for the 1st round before my friendtook the reins in the 2nd round. After that, we grabbed some bubble tea from a place literally a minute away and decided to walk around Eaton Centre to walk off all the meat. Around 6:30 is when we left and took the streetcar to get to Mod Club. When we got there, the line was already **long**. We literally had to go to the end of the block to line up and the cold was not nice to have for so long. Along the way, I saw people had banners which I thought were gonna be given to everyone, but it was actually an independent thing run by soshified so only early birds got it for the concert (I did manage to [get one](https://imgur.com/lpFV7aC) after the concert since there was literally a stack chilling on the seats). Eventually we got in, my friend got a shirt from the merchandise, and we situated outselves on the right side of the floor where they had an elevated platform with benches along the side in case you needed to sit. Friend really needed it since she's on the shorter end of the spectrum. 

#Main Setlist
**The Flower** - This woman. She comes out looking like a **SUPERSTAR**. I was really taken aback with how absolutely stunning she looked. If you think Tiffany Young doesn't work with blonde hair, **YOU'RE WRONG**. She had young lady gaga vibes all over her with the blonde hair and outfit she had... in the immortal words of Chungha, it was a wow wow thing. Her vocals don't lie. It is real and it is stellar. Tiffany is my flower. Tiffany was Toronto's flower for this night.

**I Just Wanna Dance/Express Yourself (Madonna cover)** - When she started this song, I yelled ""OH MY GOD"" hard because I did not expect her korean content to come out. Then the band started going and out comes this jazzy version of IJWD and it is absolute insanity. It's kinda ruined the studio version for me honestly. It's that good live. Her voice fits in with the r&amp;b/jazz sound so nicely. The crowd was going hard for the chorus (""DANCE. THE NIGHT AWAY""). All the sudden, she says ""Now that you're dancing, are you ready to express yourself?"" and transitions to Madonna's Express Yourself which she nailed.

**Over My Skin** - She prefaced this song going about how proud she is to be a woman and this song made her feel empowered. woman Woman *WOMAN* WOMAN **WO MAN** (more like whoa man). You're gonna hear this a lot in this FA, but this song is so amazing to hear live. Imagine the CD... that's what you're getting x10. Tiffany don't play around.

**FOOL/Talk Talk(Girls Generation song)** - Pulling out more from the Korean side. She performed FOOL which I hadn't heard in so long, but damn it sounded nice live. She then transitioned to Talk Talk by SNSD for a bit which I recall being a song she was personally fond of so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised this came up, but still it was nice to hear out of her.

**Peppermint** - I actually had never heard this song until this night because I somehow just skipped over it. So when I heard this, I thought it was a cover. However, once I heard the red green red green part, I thought of Christmas, and it clicked that this song existed. Honestly, even though this is a christmas-esque song, it's such a chill song to hear that it could work as a late-night commute song. Tiffany's gaze + moves on this song were actually killer.

**Teach You** - My 2nd favourite song from hers. The crowd was into this song and I became a stupid stupid (fan)boy. I never realized how simplistic this song was compared to her other songs, but this really showcases her vocals well since it's a lot of simple beats and synths. The live version with the band cranked it up to have drums and guitars which was damn good.

**Not Barbie** - For this song, she brought out a few fans onstage (who were picked out at some point previously) and talked about staying strong and loving your differences no matter who tells you what. During the song, she threw out a middle finger and a ""fuck"" somewhere going headstrong af for this one. Every now and then, she tries to pass the mic over to the fans who were always taken by surprise (probably still taking in the reality of the situation) 

**Gone (*NSYNC cover)** - Tiffany talked about how she grew up with \*NSYNC as it personally affected her, missing someone in her life at that point in time. It was a beautiful cover and her emotions were all out on this song which was moving.

**Runaway** - Keeping things on the slow side, she went onto this song which another great song to hear live. Got my head bopping good on this one.

**Lips on Lips** - ""These Lips on Lips they go like this (they go they go they go they go)"" always got my whole body bopping like a silly hyped boy. Once again, the band cranks up their game to make this memorable and the crowd was all into it too.

**Born Again** - My favourite song from her solo material and she delivers it straight from the CD to the stage. Unbelievable. Sang along the whole time and I have no regrets.

**Freedom! '90** - Honestly had never heard of this song until tonight so I can't say too much on it. However, this was the last song and it was a solid cover to end things off. 

Sidenote, I left out other talk segments that she did in between songs, but it was mostly about her talking about woman empowerment (but still always explicitly stated her love for both genders) and self-motivation type speeches relating to the songs she performed.

Afterwards, we gave mad props to the band (who as you can tell from my recollections so far, have been fantastic) and she left for a bit to ""look real good"" for us (even though she looked hella good the way she was). Gave us a break to breathe and just take in everything we watched. People around me were just as dumbfounded as me over the incredible performance Tiffany just put out for the last hour. My friend and I were shook as all hell. Tiffany eventually came back out (same outfit and all) to do the next part of the concert.

#Q&amp;A
So as her way of getting more intimate with us, she took some questions on twitter and answered them on stage for us (other cities, you can still tweet questions at her [here](https://twitter.com/tiffanyyoung/status/1101889696127365132). I don't actually remember all of the questions off the top of my head but I can remember some of them along with certain moments (I'll fill in the rest when I have time to watch the fancam of the full Q&amp;A):
* **Q**: ""What are you most excited to check out in Toronto since it's your first time here?""

**Tiffany's answer**: ""Seeing all of you here at the mod club""
Subsequently, people just yelled ketchup chips and poutine. She talked about how she went to a bachelor party and she said that poutine has correlation to lots of drinking on her end.

* **Q**: ""What do you do when you find yourself missing Prince and Princess?""

**Tiffany's answer**: ""I always ask my aunt to send me pictures and every now and then I facetime her and I have to *gestures her to move aside*"". Before she gave her answer, somebody passed over some artwork of Prince and Princess, both of which looked damn good. Her response, ""Well now I have these to look at""
* Someone got a moose in Tiffany's name to which she named Queen
* **Q**: ""What canadian stereotypes have you found to true and untrue?""

**Tiffany's answer** (and I swear this is true): ""It's cold. It's **fucking** cold.""

* Tiffany felt bad for us having to constantly deal with the cold and felt she had to buy hot chocolate for us (bless her motherly heart)
* Someone with the twitter name ""ironmansenpai"" (yes seriously) didn't ask a question, but instead said how proud they were of Tiffany and her progression as an artist to which Tiffany exclaimed, ""WHERE ARE YOU IRON MAN SENPAI?"". You can't write this stuff.
* **Q**: ""Do you watch Gossip Girl?""

**Tiffany's answer**: ""Yes I do"" and then somebody yelled something about team blair or team serena to which Tiffany said ""Honestly, I'm Team Serena"" (don't watch gossip girl myself so this flew over my head, but of course Tiffany watches a show whose acronym is GG)

After she got through the list of questions, she took questions from the audience and pretty much half of them were SNSD song requests which Tiffany was happy to fufill (at least until near the end when she really wanted to answer actual questions). 

**Songs briefly sung included**: Mr. Mr., Into The New World, Twinkle, Genie (with a ""Toronto, put it back on"" included), All Night, Bittersweet Memory

The crowd sang the absolute fuck out of these songs especially ITNW. If you wanna hear how hard we went for ITNW, [just listen for yourself](https://twitter.com/sonexjinro/status/1102405921643352064). My heart is so happy that all this happened. After ITNW, she thanked us for remembering the moments SNSD shared and that they will create new ones. """"GG Forever"". *wakanda pose*

After ITNW, a scary moment occurred where someone in the crowd actually fainted to which all of Tiffany's alarms went off asking ""Is he okay? Is he okay? You need water?"" and said she would check up on him after. Security helped the poor dude out and I didn't really see him, so hopefully he's feeling all right now. After that, Tiffany asked if we were all still okay to continue with the Q&amp;A which we all were okay with. Vibe was a little off for a bit after, but it re-balanced pretty quickly. So she went on with more questions which I only remember a couple for now:
* **Q**: ""Could you your introduction from when you first started music?""

**Tiffany's answer**: She did both her SNSD Korean introduction which was so bubbly and cute and her American introduction where she just full-on flipped a switch and her charisma seeped out with the intention to take over the world.
* **Q**: There was a girl who wanted to pursue art as a major post-high school and was asking Tiffany for advice since she was hiding it from her parents and was scared.

**Tiffany's answer**: ""As long as you don't do anything wrong and dedicate yourself to the craft. Putting in hundreds of hours develops you as an artist which would make your parents proud. It's not just for you, but for the people around you.""
* **Q**: How does it feel to an asian female artist in NA?

**Tiffany's answer**: ""Growing up, I had trouble identifying with people who looked like her (somewhat the story behind Not Barbie). I'm lucky and honoured to go on this journey and give my all for you guys. So give me your all since this journey is together"".

Sidenote, some blockhead (probably a spy from Dispatch) had the audicity to yell out a question involving Jessica which Tiffany, **thankfully**, did not hear and other people in the crowd were not okay with. Luckily, it wasn't persistent so things didn't get as bad as it could've been. Once all the questions were done with, she took a group photo with everyone and demanded to see everyone's faces, literally saying, ""Put down your phones, I wanna see your faces"". She thanked us for a wonderful show saying, ""this is the beginning"" and left with a roaring crowd behind her.

#Post-concert
Grabbed a banner from the stack like I mentioned before, sat down for a bit while the crowd walked out while simultaneously just trying to take it all in. Then, a bit of a funny event happened. If you guys aren't aware of [@SonexStella](https://twitter.com/SonexStella) on Twitter, she runs a big SNSD fanpage on Twitter who actively posts translations and other GG-related content. Later come to find out that she is from Toronto herself and was at the concert tonight (in fact, she asked the first question in the Q&amp;A and has been posting a lot from the concert). I was talking to my friend about her and her page as we were walking towards coat check and then this asian girl stared at me before this exchange happened:

**Me**: ""You're her aren't you?""

**@SonexStella**: ""Yep"" 

And that's how I met the girl behind the fanpage I've followed for so long.

After my friend got her coat from coat-check, took the same route back to Union station, went our separate ways, and now I am home just soaking in the reality of what I paid to watch. Also I woke up at 7AM this morning because I guess I don't need sleep anymore.

Overall, this concert gets a **2014** out of 10. I felt like it was 2014 again and I was fresh off the SNSD stanning ship and I cannot fathom the fact that I paid less than $40 for **that** experience. Her American-artist presence was jaw-dropping yet I caught all the features that made her stand out in SNSD (THE EYE SMILE). Other cities, be ready to be blown away and get your money's worth + so much more because Tiffany is on the road to world domination and this was just the beginning of it.

**TL;DR**: It was the best self-motivation musical performance I've ever seen.",25,105

With the news of Takahashi Juri graduating AKB48 and joining Woollim Entertainment (Top 10 Anime plot twist am I right? haha) and the news of Takeuchi Miyu planning to sign with a Korean agency which hasn't been revealed yet, is Produce 48 becoming a long term Win or Loss for the Japanese idol industry?

From what I know and having conversations with a Jpop fan I know, Produce 48 has been a REVOLUTIONARY show in Japan. Majority of schoolers in Japan has been talking about among friends and has been getting serious coverage in Japan. With the recent news of Takahashi Juri going to Korea, reactions on Yahoo Japan was quite positive and people were really supporting her decision. Takeuchi Miyu is also planning to join a Korean agency pretty soon too. We just have to wait a bit (please let it be Antenna...) Moreover, IZ\*ONE seems to be quite par the 48 groups in terms of popularity in Japan even with having only 12 members compared to... (I really don't know much how many there are, it's a culture shock for me). Not to mention that they've only debuted for only 5-6 MONTHS! Honda Hitomi really had her life turned around with this program and now she has international fans as well as both Japanese and Korean fans.

Takahashi Juri also said that going to Korea will have her take to the next level. I heard from many Japanese livestreams in the past few months that Produce 48 really brought out the potential among Japanese trainees and had them excited that they are going to the next level. Considering that the news of her going to Woollim is trending in Korea AND Japan, there is going to be a lot of speculations among the Japanese participants, that's for sure. I feel as if some Japanese people view Korea as the country with higher standardized idol-music industry now.

I wouldn't be surprised if Sakura, Nako or Hitomi joins a Korean company after expiration of IZ\*ONE.

My question for you is... will Produce 48 hurt the Japanese idol industry in the long term?",38,63

OMG I AM SO EMBARRASSED. 

Ok i have been into kpop for 3 or 4 years now and i just realized something that made me cringe so much i died. 

So i have been a fan of Jessie for a while, but i didnt get introduced to her from her rapping. I was watching a K-Drama and one of the songs in the soundtrack was ""My Romeo"" which was her singing. (If you haven't heard it , 15/10 would recommend). Anyway, i knew her when she had black or dark hair. She was always kinda tan but the black hair madenher look a little lighter. 
So end if backstory, heres the cringe:

I love to watch choreography. I  watch Matt steffanina, Phil Wright, FEFE, and most importantly, 1Million dance studios. 1Mill was dancing to Gucci from jessie, which i loved. But, i hadnt seen the music video yet or seen jessie in a while. In the video , one of the dancers was tan and blonde and she was in the middle and I was intrigued. I look at her face and i see that her foundation was NOT ONLY like 5 shades lighter than her body but not blended down her neck. So there was just this line at her jaw that made her look like a geisha. I know the korean makeup trend but i still even if you have lighter foundation, blend it down your neck. 

Dont worry im almost finished.

So...... I commented ""Girl in the middle look like queeb Elizabeth with a chinstrap of cocaine."" And i let that shit simmer. A few weeks later I watched the music video (had already forgotten about the girl 8n the choreo video)  and was like ""yas queen, you DID that! Looking like a goddess with the blonde hair."" And made NO connection

Fast forward to yesterday, IT FUCKING HIT ME. I went to the choreo video and sure enough i finally realized  
IT WAS JESSIE IN THE VIDEO!
I HAD JUST INSULTED THE QUEEN OF KOREAN RAP!
I didn't make the connection because i didnt expect an Idol to come to some random dance studio. It would be like if Ariana grade just decided to come to your yoga class at 24 hr fitness. So i didnt think it would be her dancing to her own song at this studio. 

The shitty part is, no one flamed me in the comments, not a single person commented "" hey bitch, thats jessie your talkin about."" HOW? I said one joke about RM from BTS being sexually frustrated for writing ""expensive girl"" and almost immediately i was  harassed and insulted for my joke. But i straight out talk shit about the QUEEN, and no jessie stans said anything. Im disappointed, and im discusted at myself. It cringe everytime. Im so sorry Jessie, you are beautiful and dont let anyone say otherwise.

But in my defense sweetie, you really needed to blend that shit down your neck. You looked kinda like slenderman.

But some companies have a special touch. For example: 

**SM**

* groups have STRONG vocals 

* have some of the best dancers signed to them

* the singers are trained to have a clear, ...""straight""(idk a better word but i just mean they dont do a whole lot of rolls and if they do its very clear what notes theyre using.....singing experts help me out here) singing style

* their dances are always complex and take alot of skill (and energy) to execute. Very focused on sharp execution. Watching EXO or SHINee dance will show my point, but its like that for the whole company haha

**YG**

* started off as a haven for hip hop and rnb and soul(?) Artists

* marketing strategy seems to be to make fans desperate, lol

* used to ""not care"" about visuals a whole lot but recently changed

* singing style is very soulful and rnb-esque

* dance technique? What dance technique?

* i personally felt like YG trained his artists to have really good stage prescence and not be uncomfortable getting the crown engaged

**JYP**

* the dances to their songs tell the story of the song, if that makes sense. Watch twice or 2pm dance and youll get my point

* singing style is ""breathy""....smh i sound like a fool trying to describe these but listen to Miss A or Twice songs (ESP Likey, during the bridge) and youll see my point

**CUBE**

* they make some pretty great ""girl crush"" groups, i mean i could be dead wrong but i cqnt recall any cute concept girl groups from there. 

Im interested to see the similarities in training for  BTS and TXT. Its cool to me, its like a lil family coat of arms ",99,134

566,2019-03-06,2019,3,6,5,axq2pw,Stone music ent audition experience,Astronawtttt,1551819195,"So I auditioned for Stone Music Entertainment this past weekend and I wanted to share my experience and urge others who auditioned to share their story if they are comfortable enough to do so! :)) 


Im a male in my early twenties and thought it could be a cool experience + ngl, wanted tomdo it with the possibility of getting on the next season of broduce but considering they started filmimg already... ahh idk LOL. Ive auditioned for SM before and because of their reputation there were obviously lots of attendees so I just assumed this was going to attract fewer people so I decided to arrive later around 4pm(the time they were auditining was between 1-6pm). I got there and basically waited 2 and a half hours... because unlike SM auditions, where 10 people enter the room at once and they start their audition without any introductions. 

When it came time for me to do my audition, I went in and there were three judges. At least two of them spoke English. I gave them my audition form and the lady in the middle said stand on the X so I can take your picture first. After that they asked what I prepared and I said a song and my song choice was Like Im Gonna Lose You by Meghan Trainor. I figured its a catchy, swingy song with a nice hook. I tried to focus more on making a song my own rather than doing vocal acrobatics because even though they are nice when executed correctly, nerves and everything but prevent you from doing what you want so its high risk high reward I guess. I just decided to show them the timbre of my voice and after i sang and realized how cheesy the lyrics were I had a uwu moment and kind of retreated into a ball and giggled and the judges seemed to find it funny or endearing I guess(I hope LOL). One of the coordinators said they would contact anyone theyre interested in withinntwo months but I know that for other companies if theyre interested they ask you to stay and re-audition you on the spot. Not sure if its the same procedure but overall it was really fun and for the first time ever I was able to be in the moment and chill and not have heart palpitations(mainly due to how nice the judges were). Anywho, let me know if you have any questions about the process or if share your experience too, I would love to know how everyone did :) there were many talented dancers I must say at my city and majority was girls(80/20 ratio)",16,211

So this concert was two nights ago and I feel like I'm still on a post concert high. It's taken me a lot longer than I thought to write this up,but there was really so much I wanted to say! KNK were absolutely \*amazing\* live and kings of fan interaction. They were so comfortable on stage with each other and with fans. Kudos to you if you decide to read all this, because it is going to get LONG.

I am a relatively new Tink who only seriously got into the group through Lonely Night, but I fell in love with them extremely fast. When they announced their US tour, I bought tickets immediately to the NYC show. MMT released a special VIP package in addition to the concert tickets called Closer (like ACEs higher choice) for $200. I managed to snag one before they sold out. The package included a full merch package, Q&amp;A session, personal signing, and solo photo with the group.  


**CONCERT LOGISTICS**

The KNK venue was Warsaw in Brooklyn. It was an interesting choice of venue, as it is a part of a Polish community center and usually hosts indie bands. I think KNK was the first kpop group to perform there. The venue is pretty intimate - it is on the smaller side and holds \~800 people. The concert ran for 2 hours (although it felt like 5 minutes long).

One thing to note with MMT concerts: when they give out numbered wristbands for GA, the top 10 tastemakers always get #1-20 (as they get 2 free vip tickets). If there is a special VIP event (higher choice/closer), the VIP ticket holders with the event will get in before all other VIP ticket holders (for KNK, Closer VIP ticketholders were #21-41). Since I was VIP + Closer, I didn't line up. I got to the venue a little after noon to go straight to the closer event.

# CLOSER EVENT

**INTRO**

I was pretty nervous for Closer, as I had never done anything like a fansign before (only hi touch). They brought us into this small bar area of the venue, and where KNK were already seated at a table. There were I think 5 rows of 5 chairs and I was in the 4th row. KNK waved and said hi to all of us as we walked in. They looked tired but happy to see us! Overall, the Closer event was a lot of fun and definitely worth the $200. KNK have such a great relationship and played around with/teased each other throughout the whole event. They were also so comfortable with us, waving and sending hearts whenever they had a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q&amp;A** 

MMT had us all submit three questions prior to the event, and they chose one of each of our questions to read and translate to the group. Overall, the Q&amp;A went pretty quickly (which was the most unfortunate part of the event). None of the members were fluent with English (although they tried!), so the translators and staff moved it along pretty quickly. I don't remember all of the questions from this, but here are the ones I have:

* My question was: if you could switch bodies with any of the members for a day, who would you choose? Inseong immediately said Heejun. Heejun --&gt; Inseong. Dongwon --&gt; Heejun. Jihun --&gt; Inseong. Seoham --&gt;Jihun
* Someone asked Heejun if he was still in touch with anyone from MixNine, and he said no one. And then Seoham just straight up said he hated mixnine(same). Heejun went back and said he still talked to one of the Romeo members, but that that everything else on the show was shallow/insincere (I think the question was directed towards new people they hadn't met before, versus people they were friends with before the show).
* Dongwon was asked who the most affectionate member towards him was and he said Inseong
* Another question for Heejun - 'If you had yaja time, who would you talk down to first?' All the members said that they always talked informally, so it was always yaja time. Heejun said it wouldn't be fun otherwise
* What would the members be if they weren't idols? The ones I remember --&gt; Heejun said soccer player and Dongwon said penguin trainer
* The members were asked to describe the person sitting next to them. Unfortunately I only remember what Dongwon said about Heejun - ""Heejun knows he's sexy on stage""

&amp;#x200B;

**SIGNING + PHOTO**

I brought my album for them to sign, but there were a variety of items there. The staff didn't rush people along which was really nice! The order was Heejun --&gt; Dongwon --&gt; Seoham --&gt; Jihun --&gt; Inseong. I had the same sticky note for all of the members asking them to draw a cat.

They were all so sweet and tried their best to converse in English. Dongwon is ridiculously handsome in person (although they all are). He loves getting close, making eye contact and complimenting something about you. Seoham is the biggest sweetheart and gives you 1000% his attention.

&gt;For those interested in their cat drawings: [Heejun](https://i.imgur.com/mgpk8VK.jpg) | [Dongwon](https://i.imgur.com/aLcXBFZ.jpg) | [Seoham](https://i.imgur.com/HVVGAMc.jpg)  | [Inseong](https://i.imgur.com/zK4uyAb.jpg) | Jihun (no drawing as I had him sign something to a friend for her birthday)

For the photo op, the staff took the photos with our phones and we were allowed to choose our own poses (only rule being no skinship that would make them uncomfortable). I did a pretty basic 'arms around the shoulder/back' pose between Seoham and Jihun! It was a pretty cute photo, minus Seoham casually choking himself with a balloon that he had tied around his neck lol. After photos were finished, that was the end of the Closer event. The members waved goodbye to all of us and left the room. We got our merch packages, and went back outside to get in line for wristbands.

&amp;#x200B;

**FUNNY MOMENTS**

* Every time the crowd awwed or made a lot of noise, Seoham would politely say thank you
* Seoham wandered to the bar at one point and pointed at all the bottles. He made a drinking motion and asked us if we wanted to drink
* During one fan's photo op, Seoham saw she had an ACE phone case and jokingly took the phone going ""no ACE, no ACE!!"" And Inseong was like ""No no no don't worry we love ACE""
* Seoham playing around with Dongwon's arms and making him hit himself in the head

# THE CONCERT

Man, the concert. If you ever have a chance to see KNK live, *please* do. They are absolutely amazing performers. Their live vocals were flawless and so was their dancing. I absolutely adore Inseong's vocals, and hearing him live was a whole new experience. He was so stable and strong the entire show. I was also really impressed by Dongwon. He had to learn the choreo/lyrics for all the songs and he did so well! He was super intense on stage during the serious songs and a giant softie during the more laid back ones.  


There were 21 performances total (including 2 encore songs) - 17 KNK songs and 3 cover stages. Aside from the amazing performances, KNK are insanely good with fan service. The members are constantly making eye contact/interacting with fans. Seoham especially - I feel like he was looking at a fan at any given point in a performance.  


I originally wanted to write a little about each performance, but it would honestly get super repetitive and make this 10x longer than this already is. So I'll put the set list below with some random thoughts and fancams. Also, I really don't remember the order of the talks/ments so I may be confused as to when things were said. They did have a translator during all the talks as the members weren't super comfortable with English.

&amp;#x200B;

**SETLIST**

1. **Lonely Night:** They started the show off immediately with Lonely Night and the crowd went wild. The fanchants were so loud!
2. [**Feel So Good**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15ZxFHd_GWHisHck43VO0FGOqdxYt-t_9)**:** They went right into their second song, Feel So Good, which is my FAVORITE b-side. They had so much fun with this song and their energy was really infectious! 
3. *\[Introductions\]*
4. [**Rain**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18B9nDUsI_nnaDe0oTexaigbMf33WmjyU)**:** Rain is my absolute FAVORITE KNK song and I teared up seeing it live. It's a shame they didn't do the original umbrella choreography, but it was still amazing. Inseong blew me away with his vocals (as he did with every performance). Boy has some pipes.
5. **Day By Day**
6. **What Do You Think**
7. *\[Talk\]* 
8. **Sun Moon Star:** My second favorite song after Rain. ~~Teared up pt. 2~~
9. **Propose**
10. **Gone:** One of the songs I was least familiar with going into the show, but it was such a great performance. \[Insert 10000th comment about Inseong's vocals here\]
11. [**Back Again**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qdtFpphFnFHdqsttUFbADhgq4dc1F4E0)**:** Back Again is such a good and catchy song. All I can say is, Dongwon was INTENSE during this song, it was scary.
12. *\[Talk\]* They talked about preparations for the US tour. Inseong said they didn't have much time to prepare for the US tour, but they did prepare a few special stages. Heejun teased the crowd saying ""It seems like you guys don't really want to see it yet?"" *\[Cue screaming crowd\]*
13. [**The Eve**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2rsz7o2znyp2cpx/20190303_194333.mp4?dl=0) (full group dance cover): I had seen countless fancams of this performance from previous stops and thought I was ready. And I was not ready at all. Heejun is an absolute force on stage. Dongwon was right at the Q&amp;A session when he said Heejun knows he's sexy on stage. His facial expressions and moves all ooze confidence
14. [**As Long As You Love Me**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e1el43HJi-tHfweH4K46ppr3jIEaMSQd) (cover by Inseong, Dongwon and Heejun): I could talk about Inseong's vocals all day. Heejun also has a wonderfully sweet voice. Their tones matched nicely with each other, along with Dongwon's rap. Dongwon absolutely KILLED it and the crowd was hyping him up so much.
15. [**I'll Show You**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1du1UP4MQBDA7ttSUTAEfO-_UevOgL8hp) (Jihun dance solo): I refused to spoil myself to this stage and it was absolutely worth it. He was so sweet and bowed before he started. I think that Jihun is such a talented and underrated dancer - it was a really beautiful performance. As soon he he finished and the crowd went wild, he got shy again and made a big heart for the crowd
16. *\[Prize Time\]* Random fans got signed Polaroids based on ticket numbers
17. *\[KNK Anniversary surprise\]* The Tinkerbells in NYC fan project helped organize a surprise event for KNK's third anniversary! During the intro of Beauty, the staff cut the music/lights, leading to a very confused KNK. They continued singing and dancing for a few seconds until the staff brought out the cake and they realized what happened. [Here is a good video of the surprise](https://twitter.com/fullkun/status/1102396407288381440?s=09)! KNK were super touched by the cake and so excited! It was such a sweet moment.
18. [**Beauty**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tttJHLmOHr8QhkXnyej5P12EQRS2d_ON)**:** My second favorite b-side. It is such a feel good song, and they had so much fun with it.
19. [**U**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13WdZYm_CBGFyu4fklRvI0OQnv1MRahIc)**:** Like Gone and Back Again, U is such a classic and dramatic song. I love the footwork and really the whole choreo.
20. *\[Talk\]* I think this was when they talked about what they did the previous day after landing in NYC. Dongwon and Seoham were the only ones who went out. They spent time with Seoham's family (he had an aunt who lives there), and went to a rooftop bar in Times Square for drinks. The rest of the members just slept/stayed in the hotel. It was their last stop, so they must have been exhausted. Heejun said that they only had upbeat/energetic songs left and to be prepared.
21. **Love You**
22. **Day N Night** 
23. [**Tonight**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1elzKTMuNQYY016Nwu4sxq_VnAa_2fZzJ)**:** True to Heejun's word, these three songs were all super fun and upbeat. They took headbands/toys/props from fans during these performances and just had a blast on stage. Someone gave Heejun a bi flag at some point!
24. \[*Final Talk\]* All the members made their last ments. I don't remember much of it anymore, but one thing that did stand out was one of Inseong's comments. He said that he was really touched because even when he looked out at the very back of the crowd, he could see all the fans singing along.
25. **Angel:** The concert honestly passed by in a flash and Angel had me all emotional. Such a sweet song to end the show on.
26. **I Remember + Think About You** (Encore): The encore felt really intimate? They were so sweet with the crowd and really tried to make contact with every fan/camera.

&amp;#x200B;

**POST CONCERT: HI-TOUCH**

After the concert ended, I had to wait around for the hi-touch. The staff had a bit of trouble getting everyone to line up properly so it took awhile. I honestly don't have a lot to say about the hi-touch as it was pretty standard. The line was SUPER long but went fairly fast. They were all super attentive and thanked every fan!

&amp;#x200B;

**THE END**

You are a trooper if you made it to the end of this rambling mess. This was really one of the best concerts I've been too, and I am so happy I decided to go. Like I said before - if you get a chance to see KNK, please do! You won't regret it.",8,65

I was watching the recent eye contact version of Alligator dance practice and in the comments, someone linked ""Be my Friend"" and watching that made me feel like it's probably nice to watch over Jooheon as a son?

Like he just looks like one of those kids that grow up big and strong and you're happy and grateful for that and love them to bits. 

And Dino, while not being my fave in SVT, is someone who appears to have his shit together. I think that's really cool. He knows what he wants and works for it, despite being the youngest. He doesn't seem too scared to try new things -recently he held a vlive which was mostly him perfecting a choreo. Idk but watching him repeat it again and again made me think about how this was a visualization of ""it's okay not to get things right the first time. It's okay to keep trying and aiming for a beautiful result."" Honestly to me, he's so admirable.",8,19

I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation.  This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. Good luck!

p.s: my next video on youtube should be coming up in next week. Motion Graphics are super hard to learn TT\_TT, but it should be better than my first one. Stay tuned!",2,20

I just learned from someone on twitter that Park Bom's Spring album is being shipped on Amazon. It says that the seller is  D-Nation (her label). Also, it says in the description that the sales from there will count towards Hanteo &amp; Gaon chart. Is this legit? I followed Bom and D-Nation on twitter and instagram, but they didn't include Amazon as place to purchase the album. They only mentioned places such as Yes24, hot Tracks, Interpark, Aladdin, Van D &amp; Rooney to purchase the album. If we buy from these sites, will the sales count towards the charts anyway? I just don't understand D-Nation doesn't have a website where we can just purchase it directly from them.",2,6

Id love to hear everyone elses examples and see if I can pick out the specific voices as well.

I feel like this happens in really often in NCT Dream songs:

 MFAL: Haechan 

We Young: the so what, we hot, we young is very obviously just Chenle

Go: you can clearly pick out a higher pitched voice during the chorus but Im not sure if its Renjun or Chenle

We Go Up: Renjun

Trigger the Fever: The high notes are Haechan and the Oh Oh Oh Ohs are Chenle 

My Page: is basically a Renjun solo

Some I can think of: 

- [Fresh Adventure by Laboum ](https://youtu.be/m0o7fbNKhpM). The start especially reminds of music from then.

Music is not sexually-oriented, and K-Pop is not exclusive to just woman and gay men, it is for everybody, and the same goes for all types of music. K-Pop is too amazing to be tailored to only certain types of people. You dont have to question your sexuality if you like K-Pop either. To the people putting straight men down for liking K-Pop, please just sit down for a few hours and question what you are doing with your life. It is completely unacceptable to call a straight man gay or ask them if they really are straight just because they like K-Pop. What are you trying to achieve with saying these things to a straight man just because of a certain type of music they like, are you just trying to feel better about yourself?

Like a lot of people that listen to Kpop, I'm not fluent in Korean, so when I first heard a song, I generally try to deduce the meaning of the song by the general vibe it gives off, the bits of English sprinkled in, and the little Korean that's sprinkled in. 


And sometimes I'm just off the mark.

Eg. Seventeen's Fast Pace and JamJam. 

Fast Pace sound like a sexy song...it's about a relationship going through a rough patch, with the guy feeling like there's no use for him to walk at the girls Pace. 

JamJam. Going by the initial English lyrics of ""baby play with me"", I was actually pretty surprised to read the lyrics...if you take out the ""baby"" I think it could pass as *Just Do It*'s jock younger brother. ",124,52

The results have been updated on this [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/kpoproduce).

It's voting time again. Just like last past weeks, each redditor has up to SEVEN votes each. You have to choose 11 idols each time.

Head [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO_xSGVuVdzdNCKW48jtNSW3eFG6y7gFyFGrW-2txd0UtQ-w/viewform?usp=sf_link for the weekly voting. Take note, that voting has been reset and all previous votes are now discarded. The next elimination will be revealed in Week 7 after 3 weeks of voting plus position ""evaluation"" votes and benefits.

Just like the show, I'm also having the redditors vote for which idol suits which concept song the best. You are to choose one idol for each of the 5 songs and you cannot vote for an idol for more than one songs. You have 7 times to vote for this also. The Top 12 idols for each song will be considered as a group. If an idol makes it to the top 12 of more than one song, the song with more votes will be assigned to the idol. If the votes are tied, it will be randomised. Head [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6Uiw2aTL_qWs7ewla6Rdv94Sd0U14nJnl8iT8AqOIJQ0uRA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to vote!

It's also time for the position ""evaluation"". The idols has been assigned into the teams according to the positions profile that I linked on Week 1. If there are more than one position listed, it will be randomised. Based on the elimination ranking, I've assigned them into groups. If a group is filled up, then no more idols will be assigned to that group. Each idol with the most votes in the groups will get 75 benefit votes. Each idol who has the most votes in each position: vocal, dance and rap, will get an additional 100 benefit votes. I know some idols might be more of one position than others but since I don't know too much of every group, I just follow the one on the profiles and randomised it. Please don't harp on someone who should be in one position than the one assigned as this is just for fun anyway!

You have until 14/03/2019, 6 AM EST to vote!",32,47

862,2019-03-08,2019,3,8,4,aygkj6,Discussion on TXT and their future,JasonTheMoron,1551986824,Sooo how do I start. First of all let me tell you about my thoughts before their debut. As someone that was a huge bts fan back in the day I was pretty intrested in TXT. I was hoping they would be my new bts. No hate on them btw. I still listen to their songs but I somehow grew apart from most of the members. But this isn't about them. So I watched some of their teaser image but I decided to go in fully blind. So didn't new any names. My first listen to their title track was ok. I'm not the type of guy who likes energetic boyish stuff. But I grew to like the song especially the choreo. I think the mv was why I didn't like the song so much. I think it's pretty unstructured an fast paced contrasting to the song. After some listens to their mini album I had mixed feelings. I loved songs like our summer or dogs and cats but the others weren't my cup of tea. Nevertheless I found it to be a very successful debut. I won't Stan for now though. After that I though about all the other groups that will debut this year and was wondering how TXT will do. First of all they didn't  do that well digitaly in Korea. I don't know about the album sales though. Their views on their mv was impressive but I think most of them are from international stans. Many of them were writing rookie of the year but I don't think they will get that title. Mnet will give it to their new group. Itzy will win a ton. And Treasure 13 which I am rooting  for. Of course we have to see how they debut but survival show always build up hype and with the new 5 year contract thing of mnet will get people intrested. I didn't feel the uniqness of TXT. They hadn't any outstanding vocals or rappers. I don't really care about visuals. Their dance was phenomenal though. What I am triying to say is that I don't think they will be that successful like many international fans see them. But what are your opinions. This is a discussion after all. Feel free to write them down.,4,0

https://www.koreaboo.com/news/burning-sun-employee-fired-drug-report-aena/

A Summary :
This Aena alledgy sell and did drugs at the Club she was a Chinese ilegal inmigrant in Korea who worked as a promoter for Chinese clients. Her clients always were super rich. 
Other thing is that everybody knew she was doing drugs according to the insider. Another promoter said that thew saw her doing drugs but not selling them. 
Former employees reported Aena and two other employees that worked with her (Alice and Yang Yang) to the police back in September of 2018 for the use and distribution of drugs but the police DID NOTHING (as always lol) 
The police said that she quickly admitted her crime and that she was a ilegal alien but she dissmised the orders and made a lawsuit. 
The employees who reported Aena were fired. The reason? ""This is Seungri's club so if you report of drugs we may close down. So hurry up and cancel your report and leave Burning Sun today""

I believe it's kpop, hence why I thought this would be the best place to ask. or maybe it's even an anime ost.
Bubbly but soft sounding song, girl singing, rhythm repeats a few times. 
I wanna say it's a soloist, but I could be wrong. it's kind of in the style of gfriend, or maybe iu? Probably closer between 2011-2017. Its light and cutesy, not something you'd hear in a club or something. Calm and quiet, almost whispery if I remember correctly.

He debuted and I was so captivated by him (not romantically) I just really admired his personality and musical style and yes let me be honest I did come to care about him. Later he left his group and I supported him through that and through all the hate he got. But as I noticed, the newer music and the newer image he got just slowly started being not my type at all. I stayed with him because I felt like i couldnt leave him after all this time. But seriously since 2017 I just dont feel the same way anymore. I mean his music is just not my type. The shows he goes on are not entertaining to me. His new image is.. disappointing... I expected more. And I feel so bad. Because he was truly my world at one point when I was enamored with kpop. I feel so stupid because I mean its kpop. Im one of the main stans on twitter and I have a whole group of friends and I always tweet about him and get attention. But really most of it is just out of boredom. My admiration for him has faded and now Im just.. meh. Thats how I feel about him. I think Im only there for the routine. I buy his music but never listen to it. I buy albums and calendars to fulfill my duty as a fan but I dont even look at them. I give him views on YouTube and like his ig to but boost the numbers and sales and all that but I just do it because I feel like I have to. Im just so done with being his fan.... and I feel so guilty. I just dont have the same love for kpop that I did 6 years ago. Anyone ever been through this? ",9,0

My favourites:

Now that Key has enlisted, I am gonna say his story is pretty awesome. I am quoting the [Soompi Article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1271907wpp/shinees-key-reveals-stood-sm-audition) from two months ago.

**1.SHINees Key Reveals How He Stood Out At His SM Audition:**

&gt;The singer recalled, When I was 15 years old, I came \[to Seoul\] from Daegu and repeatedly auditioned for SM Entertainment. SM Entertainment was the only agency that I auditioned for, but I kept getting rejected. I think I auditioned four or five times.  
&gt;  
&gt;When Yoo Hee Yeol asked how he had managed to finally pass his auditions and get into SM Entertainment, Key replied, I asked one of the agency employees at the time. She told me that \[SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo Man\] had said simply, with no further comment, This kid is one of ours.'  
&gt;  
&gt;Yoo Hee Yeol wondered aloud, What could have made him say that? Key exclaimed, Exactly, I dont know either! Im not sure what he saw \[in me\] that made him say that.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, Key went on to speculate that it was his unusual style that had caught the agencys attention.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the dead of winter at the time, but I wore white cargo pants and a sleeveless top with a hoodie over it, he explained. And I went to the audition wearing makeup that one of my female friends from a different middle school had applied for me.  
&gt;  
&gt;The judge at the audition looked at my style and seemed to be thinking, Who is this kid?'

2. **Girls' Generation Members consoled Red Velvet's Seulgi after her audition:**

Seulgi gave her second audition in front of Girls' Generation Members when she was 12, Seulgi said she was so nervous and scared during her audition that after she had finished it, she went to the restroom and cried. Sooyoung of SNSD approached Seulgi and complimented her on her performance by saying ""You did fine, you're really good at singing"".

Seulgi also said she sang Lee Ji Hoons Doll for her audition. [Seulgi singing her audition song on Let's eat together](https://youtu.be/qss9i_cuxQs?t=167).

1044,2019-03-09,2019,3,9,10,ayy8ll,Do you think BIGBANG is going to disband after the military?,ilovescandals,1552096003,"I always thought that since 2015 T.O.P didn't want to continue as an idol and now after the scandal he had I doubt it much more that he wants to continue.

And now we have Seungri's scandal that I think is the worst scandal that Bigbang had like the drugs and the drink driving thing it was bad but not like this. I think it is because in Korea people has less consciousness about being on the road. 
And drugs most of the famous people in the world do drugs.

Also Seungri's scandal is looking very bad to him everyday are coming out news that are proving wrong Vip and YG speech about this matter. If more important people are involved like politics and the investigation team comes closer to them I think they are going to sacrifice Seungri and put all the blame on him even if he is guilty of everything or not on a big extend.

GD's scandal is a big deal too, Korean people takes very seriously the army and what he is doing I don't understand it like???? Why do you go to active service on the military when you have an ankle injury like that? Why not going to public service? Also when he entered he was in very bad shape, he was too thin I don't how he passed the phisical test lol I think is because in that unit he could do everything he wanted without consequences? And that's why he went there?

I think this scandals sorrunding YG, Seungri and GD might be a kind of revenge of someone with a lot of power that was fucked by Seungri or YG (or both) lol but that doesn't mean they are not true.

So with all these being said I think that is very likely to BIGBANG going to disband after the military and more if things for Seungri get worse.

I remember hearing on song being posted on a kpop artist's instagram page for a car ad where he's singing a song which I believe is written specifically for the ad. I don't think the song was ever released or at least it wasn't when I first saw it being posted. From what I remember, I'm thinking it might be Zion T, but I looked through all his posts and I can't seem to find it (maybe he deleted it if it was him?). If anyone knows who the artist is or the song that was being played, please let me know! I've been searching for it for the past few hours and I can't seem to find it at all!

I feel like people don't complain nearly as much about bgs doing similar concepts as they do ggs. I have never seen the terms cute, sexy, and girl crush used in conjunction with anything as much as kpop ggs. Like nobody goes around saying Beyonce does sexy concept, Carly Rae Jepson does cute concept, and Little Mix does girl crush.

First off, there is nothing wrong with doing cute, sexy, or girl crush concepts. No two ggs are the exact same; each gg brings a different style, hence why we have a range of cute, sexy, girl crush. For example, I consider Blackpink's [DDDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHNzOHi8sJs) and Itzy's [Dalla Dalla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNfTK39k55U) to both be classic girl crush (even then they're different) while G-Idle's [Latata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mQk7Evt6Vs) is a chill girl crush to Gugudan's spunky [Not That Type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QTZCB2Ujr8).

Next off, I feel some people think that ggs do the same concept for the rest of their lives and just label that group as cute or sexy or girl crush forever. It's very common for ggs to debut with a brighter concept and go more mature as they get older. Ofc, some groups stay consistently with the same concept, but a lot of ggs also change concepts over time. For example, a lot of people think Gfriend only do cute concepts because they got big with it but they've done reminescent concepts like [TFTMN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XyBa8QsVQU) and [Sunrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iciFwCnsyY4) and those don't fit into any of the three boxes.

Thirdly, as I just exemplified with Gfriend, there are a lot of ggs who do concepts that can't be fit into cute, sexy, or girl crush like Loona, Mamamoo, Dreamcatcher, RV, CLC, etc. Like where even do you put Mamamoo's melancholic [Wind Flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8NCOA2bK6k) or RV's quirky, creepy [Peekaboo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uJf2IT2Zh8) in terms of cute, sexy, or girl crush?

Not to mention there so many amazing soloists who give us such unique music and concepts like Chungha, Sunmi, Taeyeon, Heize, duos like Davichi, Bol4, and ESPECIALLY acts like Celeb Five .

Can we appreciate that Korean female artists bring a lot of diversity and quality to the world and are equally amazing no matter what concept they do? So if you read it all,

1. drop an MV to a gg (or solo) that did a concept that's not cute, sexy or girl crush (ex: Oh My Girl's [Remember Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrvdjyIL0fA)) OR
2. drop MVs to two different groups that have the same concept but show how it can be different. (April's [Oh! My Mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2MhwXZ8IgM) vs Twice's [DTNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm5iP0S1z9w))

1064,2019-03-09,2019,3,9,16,az105n,Fan Account: Tiffany Young Lips on Lips Chicago [080318],jadia20,1552116605,"# Pre-Concert

I got there a little after 4:00PM and the line was pretty short. I ended up standing behind people who were playing SNSD trivia games like guess the song in 2 seconds, based on the high note, etc. In my head I was participating but I'm not really one to invite myself into people's discussions/games. I only had a GA ticket and VIP people were checked in and let inside around 6:00PM. Before the VIP people were allowed to step out of line, the line stretched a good block down the alley and reached a building separate from Lincoln Hall. Even when the VIP people left the line was still crazy long. When doors opened, they separated the line into last names A-M and N-Z. People with N-Z last names went over to another door and were checked in at the same time as the first group. This irked me and some people around me because we had been standing for 3 hours just for people at the end of the line to get in earlier based on their last name. I was irritated at first but I still got really close to the stage so I got over it pretty quickly. The show started almost promptly at 8:00PM. Soshified staff handed out [banners](https://i.imgur.com/u6AbkSj.jpg) that were going to be held up during ""Teach You.""

# The Concert

[Tiffany's outfit](https://i.imgur.com/F8XRud3.jpg) was beautiful and I love how she wears something different each time. All red looks good on her for sure. She performed with a live band and they were amazing from the guitarist to the backup singer. In fact, while we were waiting for Tiffany outside, we saw the guitarist come out and we all cheered for him and told him great job. He honestly killed it and that entire band deserves some recognition. The setlist was the same as the other performances with the exception of Peppermint. I was surprised she didn't perform it considering it was part of her setlists for New York and Toronto but after Talk Talk she went straight to Teach You. For Not Barbie, she brought 2 fans up on stage to sing with her though they were probably too nervous to sing. I know I would have been. During the intermission she talked about things such as International Women's day and the inspiration for her album. While she focused on uplifting women, she didn't forget about the guys either. At one point I felt like I was back at baptist church when she told the audience to turn to a women next to them and tell her she's beautiful. Overall Tiffany's voice was in mint condition. Her singing style when performing Korean songs vs English songs is very different and it's easy to see why she gets mixed opinions. I much prefer when she sings in English and her voice was amazing tonight.

# Q&amp;A

I initially thought this part wouldn't happen because she finished the concert and then left the stage. When she promised to come back I assumed it was for an encore but that's when the Q&amp;A session started. While unfortunately my question wasn't chosen, she did choose a lot of great ones. She admitted that she was nervous about the questions the staff had chosen for her but they were all great questions. 

**Most interesting parts:**

1. One of the usernames she read was @taengmother and Tiffany told Taeyeon happy birthday and mentioned that they had talked.
2. She didn't know where the bean or sky deck were and had only ever seen the bean in a movie.
3. She forgot the lyrics to Baby Steps.
4. Her favorite flower is the Lotus due to its resilience in harsh places.
5. She had to tell fans to calm down because they started arguing about which place had the best pizza.
6. Someone suggested she try Harold's Chicken and I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. Going to school in Indiana made me realize how good I had it.
7. She's hoping to have an Asia tour by the end of the summer.
8. Her favorite dance is Genie and she performed a bit of the chorus. Her favorite choreographer is Rino Nakasone who has done several of their dances and set up some of their tours.
9. Her definition of success is ""to love and be loved in return."" She believes she is a success when people love the performances that she gives.
10. She sang Into the New World, Baby Steps (barely lol), Whisper, and Genie.

# Post Concert

I'm broke so I didn't buy any merch after the concert. Overall, I got the closest I've ever been to a stage for only $36. I would have loved the VIP experience but the tickets sold out too quickly. Next time she has a North America tour I'll be sure to get a VIP ticket so that I can meet her. She seems like a very genuine person and is really friendly and affectionate with fans. I was also surprised at how good of a performer she is. I thought it would be awkward/difficult for her to perform more free-form when she had only done choreographed performances for 12 years. She owned the stage and was really lively and fun to watch. Tiffany has always been one of my favorite SNSD members and I'm so happy I got the chance to see her.

Skillwise- 

Of course there are the Mains who everyone knows that they Excel in certain areas - dance, rap and vocals. But are there people whose styles -while they may be non-conventional- you've come to appreciate?

Otherwise too. Anyone who you just appreciate as a human? And why? 

I honestly just appreciate Donyeom from SVT in this aspect. Sure he's the main vocal, but his personality - he tries. He just keeps trying and I'm actually really glad he's with SVT because they seem to be a solid support system for each other. He is really a pure soul, and has sadly, easily be duped cuz of his naivety (but I feel like he's learning with age). He also accepts being the butt of jokes  

One of my first few vids of SVT was him graciously accepting being called Jeonghan's Fool while smiling and Dino **rejected** being Jeonghan's baby. That somehow really touched me. It was like - oof. He's a _friend_. 


Also Monsta X's Minhyuk. Ugh. I just like his personality period.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a lot of previous threads on this topic but they're old so apologies if it's annoying for me to post about it again.

&amp;#x200B;

I always buy my signed Kpop albums from Mwave, YesAsia, Kpop Town etc. but I was wondering if there were other legitimate websites that re-sell signed Kpop albums?

&amp;#x200B;

For example there are a few signed albums on Mwave that I've missed over the years and I'd like to buy them but of course, they're all sold out. I was looking for something like an Mwave re-selling page etc. that people might have created in order to sell on their signed albums?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to rely on places like Twitter / Ebay etc. to buy them because I never really know if they're legitimate and you can't always trust people so I was wondering if there were official re-selling websites and places where I could buy them.

&amp;#x200B;

If not, where are some legitimate places (websites) to buy signed albums / merch etc. that people are selling, and how do you know they're real?",5,4

If you had to pick two groups which would have to switch concepts for four months (with 2 comebacks guaranteed, at the very least), which groups would you switch and which concepts would you choose as the concepts to be switched?

In my case, I'd love to see NCT with EXO's concept, with three title tracks, vocal line would have Universe as their title track and I'd love NCT Dream (or NCT U) with Lucky One and 127 with Monster.
EXO would get Boss as their title track, then maybe Limitless? CBX would get Yestoday or Timeless, probably.
Seventeen with Energetic and Wanna One with Boom Boom or Oh My could possibly be great as well.

For girl groups, I'd love to see Pristin V with maybe G-IDLE's concept (especially Senorita and La Ta Ta) while G-IDLE would get both Get It and Spotlight as title tracks. Red Velvet would get some of Oh My Girl's songs / concepts, such as Windy Day and Remember Me / Twilight (double title tracks), while Oh My Girl would probably get Russian Roulette and Peek-A-Boo.

I'd love to see Loona 1/3 with Gfriend's concept (Navillera, Time For The Moon Night) and Gfriend would get both Love &amp; Live and Sonatine as their title tracks.

I'd love to see CLC try Dreamcatcher's concept, especially Fly High and Diamond maybe? Dreamcatcher would probably get something like Show and Where Are You, maybe? (As special clips or B-Sides tbh.)

APink trying something like Wonder Girls' later concepts (Why So Lonely, I Feel You / One Black Night), while Wonder Girls' getting songs like Eung Eung and I'm so sick could possibly be really cool.

Loona yyxy with IZ*ONE's concepts could also be quite cool (imagine Suki To Iwasetai with Chuu / Gowon or LVER with Olivia / Yves as centres. Damn.), and IZ*ONE could try something like love4eva or Rendezvous 18.6y. 

The groups that I'd probably want to see switch concepts temporarily most would probably be Gfriend &amp; Loona 1/3 or Oh My Girl &amp; Red Velvet.

What about you? What groups would you like to have a temporary concept switch? On the other hand, which groups do you think will never switch concepts / their signature style?",35,44

#Seungri Has Announced his Retirement from the Entertainment Industry

&gt;This is Seungri.

&gt;At this point, I think it would be best if I retire from the entertainment industry. I decided on retiring from the entertainment industry as the issues that I caused a societal disturbance with are too major. Regarding the issues that are being investigated, I will be investigated diligently and reveal all the suspicions.

&gt;Receiving criticism and hate from the public for the past month and a half and with the situation of all the investigative agencies in the country currently investigating me, I am even being cornered as a traitor of the nation. I personally cannot tolerate causing harm to everyone around me in order to save myself.

&gt;I sincerely thank all of the fans in and outside of Korea who have given me lots of love for the past 10 years, and I think this is where I stop even if its at least [to protect] the honor of YG and BIGBANG.

&gt;Again, I am sorry and apologize once again.

&gt;I have been thankful to everyone until now.

I have been thinking this for a while now, this Seungri thing is big and it totally seems YG is also in it, so, what if the idols want to go out YG? Can the do that?

Also, the parents of all the idols inside YG, what do you think will do? I mean, if my son/daughter is in a company that may be involved in prostitution, I will totally make them go out.

They are adults of course, and can do whatever they want, but parent pressure is always a thing, and this is not something light.

The last time I ever remember this happening was back in summer 2017 with winners love me love me and island coming out together. So why does this not happen anymore, I thought big groups would do this more now since kpop is getting more popular.

As we know it now, pretty much a white invention (Beach Boys lead the way my dudes).  Wear certain clothes?  How DARE you appropriate a culture like that!?

The Town Hall is an opportunity for the mods to make announcements and propose changes, while also getting feedback from you guys about those changes and the current state of the subreddit.  Please feel free to comment about any issues that have been bothering you, and give any suggestions you may have to make r/kpop a more enjoyable place.

&amp;nbsp;

---

**Agenda**

1. New Moderators
2. Translation Task Force
3. Proposal for new Flairs
4. Discussion Rules #7
5. New Report Reason
6. New Business

---

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Moderators

Earlier this month, we opened applications for new mods. We had a great response with lots of good applications submitted. Everyone who applied seemed like they'd be great mods, and we really appreciate the time you took to tell us about yourselves. If you didn't get selected, we hope that you'll apply again if we need additional help in the future.

At this time, we'd like to welcome new members to the /r/kpop mod team:

- /u/GeekScientist
- /u/LineArk_
- /u/chineseouchie
- /u/Juicysteak117
- /u/NishinosanTV

Please make them feel welcome!

&amp;nbsp;

#### Translation Task Force

In the last Town Hall, we mentioned that we would be opening up a Translation Task Force as a hotline for subreddit moderators and users who are fluent in Korean to help us keep the quality of submissions on the subreddit to a higher standard.

We now have an application for those interested being part of the Translation Task Force. The application will have you translating an article. We also want to stress that this is a volunteer position.

##### [APPLY HERE](https://goo.gl/forms/oggQK1G40TMT2TX83)

&amp;nbsp;

#### Proposal for new Flairs

We are proposing the addition of the following as new link flairs for the subreddit:

```[Misc News]```

```[Tour News]```

```[CF]```

```[Audio Teaser]```

```[Image Teaser]```

```[Video Teaser]```

```[Misc Teaser]```

```[Variety - Subbed]```

```[Behind - Subbed]```

When these new flairs launch on the subreddit, everything but the subbed flairs will be available at submission. 

The instructions on how to activate the subbed flairs ```[Variety - Subbed]``` and ```[Behind - Subbed]```, the submission first has to be submitted and then flaired as ```[Variety]``` or ```[Behind-the-Scenes]```. The submitter then must make a comment in their submission with the following ```!varietysubbed``` or ```!behindsubbed```. It will then change the flair to the subbed version of the flair.

We just want to reiterate these flairs are not active yet. We are asking the subreddit for input in regards to specifics for when these flairs are in use or problems that may be encountered when they are in use.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New version of Discussion Rule #7

The new version of Discussion Rule #7, the rule that dictates Album Discussion posts is now **LIVE**.

&gt; Album discussion threads should include a chart containing links to all tracks on the album as well as credits for lyrics, production, and composition whenever available. Links should point to official channels when possible or unofficial links on YouTube if no official links are available. Threads that are missing tracks, links, credits, or use time-stamped videos will be removed. 

Our reasoning for the change on Discussion Rule #7 can be found in the [previous Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/aw2zk3/town_hall_march_2019/).

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Report Reason

Previously, one of the report reasons for the subreddit was:

```No Translation```

We have now expanded this report reason to further encompass [Rule 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules) for the subreddit.

```Has no or incorrect translation, or is using a disallowed source```

[A screenshot of which report reasons you should see if you report a post on the subreddit.](https://i.imgur.com/iPIm4S6.png)

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.

|:-|:-|:-|
|Lawful Neutral|True Neutral|Chaotic Neutral|
|Lawful Evil|Neutral Evil|Chaotic Evil|

[This site](http://easydamus.com/alignment.html) explains it in full, but to summarize their take on Good vs. Evil and Law vs. Chaos:

* Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent life, whether for fun or profit. People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed to others by personal relationships.
* Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties. Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if they feel like it. Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a normal respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor a compulsion to rebel. They are honest but can be tempted into lying or deceiving others.

For example, I would argue that 15&amp; Jimin Park is Neutral Good-- she's a kind person and cares, but isn't afraid to call people out even if they're authority figures ^(coughs) *^(jyp i need to SING)*. 

I'd also argue that Big Bang T.O.P is Chaotic Neutral, although you could argue Chaotic Good too-- he seems to do what he wants and believes in sort of on a whim (ex: the Instagram posts). 

However, the same person can fall into different categories based on how you interpret them. Likewise, people who seem vastly different can have the same alignment depending on their motivations and actions. 

So, which idols fall into which alignments?",147,133

1527,2019-03-13,2019,3,13,9,b0fpxa,"What are your thoughts on xenophobia in international kpop fandom, especially in regards to the tendency to dismiss Korean people and ignore cultural context in the face of scandal?",sylvan1s,1552438566,"With the recent scandal(s), there's been a lot of talk about the xenophobia international kpop fans express when talking about Koreans and South Korean culture. One of the main lines parroted by Seungri fans over the last few weeks is that this is something trivial being overblown by the uptight and conservative Korean culture, even going so far as to frame Korean media and general response to Seungri's crimes as ""backwards."" South Korean media has been covering the international reaction to all this (for example noting the difference between comments left in Korean and those in other languages) and its been eye opening to witness how deeply this notion runs throughout the fandom.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, I think its fair to call out Korean media and knetz. Ironically, one of the few times you'll see kpop fans suddenly switch to saying ""its South Korean culture that's how it is you're just being xenophobic"" is in defense of an idol who has done something racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. But in these cases what's being argued isn't an issue of relative morality, bigotry is still bigotry even within an environment where it is common/acceptable. In these cases criticism of the culture itself is warranted. However, even if these cases, in my opinion it is still better to listen to those criticisms coming from someone within that culture itself, or else you risk barging in blindly and denouncing everything you see, deteriorating into xenophobia.

&amp;#x200B;

However....for many kpop fans the default state seems to be to declare that South Koreans (usually they'll actually use the word ""Knetz"" as a substitute because it sounds better, but it means the same thing) are uptight and wrong for feeling a certain way, willfully ignoring cultural context even when people try to explain it to them. For example, take the case with Seungri and Sejung, when basically his entire fandom ignored or straight up laughed at the  Koreans trying to explain to them that what Seungri did was insulting to Sejung because its associated with prostitution (oh the irony). Even in cases that seem totally ridiculous, there's often context that international fans miss. Did you know, for example, that a big part of the reason people were so mad about that one case in which Wanna One didn't know they were on camera, was because many felt that the way they were talking so casually and not using proper honorifics in front of older staff  was inappropriate? It wasn't so much about what they said but HOW they were saying it. Again, you're free to disagree with the reaction (I sure do, and in this case I saw many Koreans saying they had done nothing wrong and that it was blown out of proportion) but see how suddenly the outrage makes slightly more sense? Context matters.

&amp;#x200B;

Other common examples  of this I see are scandals of dodging military enlistment , or especially drugs. In both these cases (especially dodging enlistment), there is DEEP cultural meaning behind why these scandals cause so much outrage. Respectful disagreement is fine, but to completely tear down the cultural roots of these issues, or even worse to claim and act as if you are ""above"" them, is DEEPLY xenophobic. Anyways, I'm sorry for this being so long, but I have a lot of things to say on this topic and recent events have only added to them. I'm really curious to see what everyone else thinks about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, this is YG Entertainment.

Starting with the assault case at the club that Seungri participated in, various suspicions and controversies have continuously arisen. We bow our heads and express deep apologies for causing trouble to many people including fans.

On March 12, following the [**announcement**](https://www.soompi.com/article/1309402wpp/breaking-seungri-announces-retirement-from-the-entertainment-industry) of Seungris retirement, YG agreed to Seungris request and decided to terminate his exclusive contract.

YG acknowledges that as a management company, we were not able to manage thoroughly, and we are deeply reflecting.

Lastly, YG realizesthe need for extensive reform and promises toput in our full effort into achieving this together with all of our staff.

He/She sent me an e-mail. (He/She said) in light of the Burning Sun incident that has been spreading, there was data that contained information on the misdeeds of people related to the incident. (He/She) wanted to reveal it to the world and realize justice but he/she couldnt find a way to. He/She asked me to do it.  
**Park Jung Hyun**

Park revealed that the chatroom data, which took place for 8 months in 2015, was extensive. Jung Joon Young had sent the hidden cam sex videos in the chatroom of 8 people including Seungri, another chatroom and 1:1 chatrooms as well.

Park also empathized with the source, who was reluctant to reveal the data. This was because there was content that suggested ties to the police and so it was only natural for the source to be scared.

&gt;They dont talk about any names (in the chatroom) directly but they mention a specific position. Simply put, one person said things like, I saw the text with the person. I contacted him/her. Its done. An unspeakable incident had occurred. In terms of the problems that arose, they said, Its done, or Its covered up, and one person even said, I received a message from a police congratulating my birthday. I cannot speak conclusively. It must be revealed through investigations.  
**Park Jung Hyun**

Ties to the police had apparently referred to one specific person who, according to Park, was a very high-level official. The persons rank far surpasses any district chief.

&gt;There is one influential person. He is mentioned numerous times. Theyre not all connected and there was only relations to the biggest one but isnt it a structure that trickles down? (Hes) not at the level of a district chief. (Hes) above that.  
**Park Jung Hyun**

Park added that there were crimes other than sexual assault mentioned in the chatroom and hoped that everything would be revealed through the investigations.

&gt;Its not related to sex. Its a completely different (crime). There are numerous similar cases being investigated in relation to the Burning Sun incident. Theres another case thats similar to one of them. I hope it will be clearly revealed through investigations.

#Seungri Has Announced his Retirement from the Entertainment Industry

&gt;This is Seungri.

&gt;At this point, I think it would be best if I retire from the entertainment industry. I decided on retiring from the entertainment industry as the issues that I caused a societal disturbance with are too major. Regarding the issues that are being investigated, I will be investigated diligently and reveal all the suspicions.

&gt;Receiving criticism and hate from the public for the past month and a half and with the situation of all the investigative agencies in the country currently investigating me, I am even being cornered as a traitor of the nation. I personally cannot tolerate causing harm to everyone around me in order to save myself.

&gt;I sincerely thank all of the fans in and outside of Korea who have given me lots of love for the past 10 years, and I think this is where I stop even if its at least [to protect] the honor of YG and BIGBANG.

&gt;Again, I am sorry and apologize once again.

&gt;I have been thankful to everyone until now.

People do stupid shit. Trying to portray them as perfect human beings who can do no wrong. 
In my experience, if something seems perfect, in reality it can't be. Never is. Ofc there is prostitution in k pop world, ofc there is drugs and whole nine yards. That's how things work in real world, even in ""perfect"" korea. 
As soon as those singers get a little freedom, who were micromanaged their whole life, the most natural thing to do is run around like a dog off chain. Suddenly they can make their own decisions, and surprise surprise, they make mistakes. 
Most of us regular people do all this shit while young, and have no press on our backs, so we can do stupid shit in privacy of our own lives, but those celebrities don't have that kind of privilage. I love it how everybody suddenly acts like they never sent nudes, did drugs or had sex, but when somebody slightly famous does it it's branded as ""scandal"".

Only a year ago, I fell down the BTS rabbit hole and then promptly discovered Big Bang, Block B, Exo, all incarnations of NCT, Blackpink, Pentagon, and many more. I feel very let down and I have been feeling more and more disillusioned. E'Dawn was my ultimate bias, and I love Hyuna too. That debacle was a major disappointment, and it hurt Pentagon as well. I hated the hipocracy of Cube entertainment, and how they mishandled the situation. I've read a lot about how SM mistreats their idols, who I feel are massively talented. I've watched BTS break down and cry when they recieve awards and talk about what a hard road it's been for them, and how they almost quit, even though they were at the top. There's the scandal with Kai and Jenny. Now Zico seems to have known about the ""golden phone"" and casually laughed about it on tv a few years ago. G-Dragon has been accused of getting special treatment in the military, and especially all the other horrible scandals coming to light now. I'm crushed. It seems like it's all a lie, everything. If anything happens with Taeyang or Mino, I'm done.
I know we are all sold this illusion, and I guess I knew all along it wasn't real, but I  have believed for awhile that a lot of the idols have been victimized by the industry. And now we are finding out that many idols are just as bad, it's just so disappointing.",0,0

Since we have moved from 2nd generation to 3rd to current I have noticed that the concepts for groups are more ambiguous than open instead of siloed. For example, with girl groups there were two main concept umbrellas: girl crush and cute.

* [Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AfuuRbgGo) vs [Lollipop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIRW_elc-rY)
* [Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY) vs. [Heart to Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h97jt1XtnGQ)
* [Hobgoblin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9OxRFab6o4) vs. [No Oh Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBGTgR1RyV8)

As we moved into the new generation you see these two concepts merging into sexy cute crush with [Blackpink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwmSjveL3Lc), [Itzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNfTK39k55U), and [gugudan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQxtwvLUByM).

Another thing I noticed was that the mature concept usually meant black outfits ([Abracadabra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwFr8o8p0Y) and [Run Devil Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gfD3nvh-8)) and now the mature concept is ""adult sexy in color"" like [Starry Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FB2EoKTK_Q) or 

Even the concepts of commercial songs have changed greatly. [Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWjKLjwtlc) vs. [NCT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwMngvoyYMw). The first is a song that is obviously an advertisement whereas the second is the song is meant for an advertisement but is actually a song that can stand on its own (see also  [Everyday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbWt67vVNgc).

I stayed up all night tonight and havent slept obsessing over Asians and am going to take benzos to go to sleep since Ive been up self harming all night and now my hands hurt and Im crying. So anyways Im obsessed with Asians. I dont want to be one I want to be Iranian or Arab, but I would take being an Asian over being white. I would prefer to be raped and beaten with a sledgehammer and stabbed 87 times and then set on fire and then my burnt corpse to be anally raped than be white. I consider it a crime against humanity to have white children and think it should be outlawed under the Geneva convention as a form of torture. I believe white people should be legally barred from marrying other white people and forced to procreate with people of color to produce mixed children and white children should be aborted or euthanized. I know way too many people who are part Asian with Asian moms and white dads and desperately wish my dad had an Asian fetish like every other white man so he would have cummed in an Asian woman and I could be Asian. My professor is white and married to an Asian and for months I stalked him and his family online and pretended to want to learn piano just to be closer to him and his family. For a while I was trying to get his son to fall in love with me. I would read his Facebook profile all night and sob and cut myself. This was the first family I saw that ever loved each other and one day I was so triggered by them I attempted to jump off a bridge. Asians have everything. They have amazing food and music and tv and movies everyone loves. They have beautiful features. What hurts me most is Asians are a group and white people arent. Theres no white solidarity. You cant feel good about yourself for being white but you can feel proud of being an Asian. Youre entitled to feel good about yourself just for being born. White people are just evil and as a white person if you kill yourself you are doing a favor to the world.

I'm directing this towards the newer/unaware fans. Mb I should say fans who are blinded by their biases in some cases to be more accurate.

Anw, here it goes... At least the short version of it, I'll be more than happy to discuss on comments on this thread.

Kpop as a whole is selling personas. Idols are ""assigned"" to personify certain traits or even personalities when they are on-cam or interacting with public. Rarely do we actually see the real and raw personalities of these idols as who they actually are IRL. At the very least, we're seeing a blend of idols' real and personified personalities. This would even probably extend to inter-group members interactions. Some are real, some are scripted/fake. We're flippin' far to actually know who these idols are. Not a chance. Take everything you see and hear during on-camera/idols work setting context with a grain of salt.

I ain't saying that being a Kpop stan is a taboo or sth, it's just more over the fact that we gotta be more intelligent in choosing how we're their fans. Don't completely fall for them, esp. since they (as idols) aren't exactly the real them in the 1st place. This scheme is the reason why some Kpop fans are toxic/fanatic/cringey; why an idol found to be dating is a huge blow to the said idol's career and many other reasons Kpop is the odd way it is for non-fans.

Moreover, I think it's also much more important to devote your resources to do sth that'll make you in a better spot. Fanboy/fangirl reasonably and accordingly! Take care of yourself and your loved ones 1st! In light of yourself and your loved ones, your biases aren't worth shit, honestly.",1,0

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what I'm planning to do is to buy what I want and add in a bit more to sell. Gmarket has nice prices if you buy a lot of albums. So I can get my personal use products for cheaper and I can also make a little profit by reselling the items I bought at a cheaper price than what most stores offer here in the Philippines since I am based here. I'm currently thinking about preordering BTS' comeback album for my sister and also ordering a bit more to resell.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm really trying to find out is how hassle is all of this is? Especially here in the Philippines where customs is a chore. How much of a hassle is it all really? I would love to hear some feedback about the experiences of resellers and how they deal with customs, suppliers, etc. no matter how big or small you may have been.

I'm not in any way trying to make light of the situation but just want to have a break and hear some positive experiences others have had!

With every update getting worse and worse, I find myself mentally exhausted and and in a state of constant disbelief. Its so heartbreaking when I think of the women who have suffered and its really easy to be angry and resentful of the situation. So taking a step back to a lighter note while still in the subreddit, tell me what about k-pop makes you happy? Did it positively benefit you in any way? Do you find yourself picking up any silly quirks from your years of following k-pop? Do you think of a funny joke your idol said that makes you randomly burst out laughing? Did you meet your best friend due to k-pop? Or share pics of something you find adorable or inspiring!


I think for me, I was never really a big music person growing up. When I was at parties or hanging out with friends, I always heard music in the background but I never focused on it and it wasn't a big deal to me. I never sought out a new playlist to follow or got excited to discover new artists or anything like that. When people asked me what my favorite songs were, I would just list out whatever was on the radio or some popular song despite not really caring for it simply because I didn't really any any. It was always just in the background for me. 

In 2016, one night I was a little drunk and in my dorm trying to do some work when I couldn't focus at all. I tried followed k-pop a little bit because some of my friends were into it and I saw a song in my recommended. I don't know what it was but listening to that song honestly felt like a life-altering experience (not to be so dramatic lol). It was that ah-ha moment in my head and something just clicked. That moment felt transcendental in so many ways and I found myself focusing on all the background instrumental noises and the choruses and the meaning behind the lyrics and way the beat changed and the emotions in the vocals and it was just everything that was missing before for me. I ended up diving a lot deeper in not just k-pop but all sorts of music with a new appreciation and a sense of excitement. 

I think that is strongest memory I associate with k-pop because it quite literally opened for me enjoying music a whole lot more and having a sense of connection with a song that I can always think back on!",87,116

I mean the American industry is more exposed and we still have problems but its not as under wraps and shady as kpop. America we all know they be snorting coke and wild. These Korean men have fame money and power. Of course theyre corrupt. Sure not all are. But majority of the industry Im sure is involved in some way. Like all the ceos, Jesus I cant imagine what they have done to get where they are now. Its a lot of power. And theyre gonna try to sweep it under the rug. Everybody is deleting the evidence now. Companies locking down on all the idols. Dark time for kpop. Im 2nd gen and its such a fucking shame, like my childhood getting demolished. ",1,0

 Other idols who i'd allow to cradle me to bed with their voices would consist of;

Now with all the shit that happened, he left senguri for wolves and I don't think he even cares what happens to him. If it was other member, he might have atleast have sticked to them but with senguri I think he won't even think twice. I think he was mostly tolerating senguri because VIP's made so much fuz about it else I don't think he even cares. At one point he even unfollowed senguri in instagram but because VIP's made a huge issue about it he followed back.

For example, Im no fan of instrumental choruses. However, iKons Killing Me has such a fun instrumental chorus imo, and it never gets boring.

Personally not a fan of constant drum / bass patterns that hits parallell with the bars/measures, but in Oh My Girls Windy Day it just works for me in the chorus. 

Too much repetition in a chorus is a no-no for me, but in Red Velvets Rookie I just love it. Half the fun of that song now lies in the way too repetitve chorus imo.

I dont like it when songs take full stops / lacks transition since I like nice transitions between parts, but in Mamamoos My Star from their new album, the stop before the chorus adds so much tension and makes the hardhitting chorus so much better.",11,41

If you get offended, I probably did something right.  

If you laugh, I probably did something right too.  

1. Only support groups from the BIG-3 and BTS. PLEDIS? What's that, a plate? Infinite? Dreamcatcher? Never heard of them. I oNlY kNoW bLaCkPiNk and Sha Sha Sha  
2. Diss old-timers and groups. Uhm Jung Hwa? KNK? Wonder Girls? SNS? MOVE OVER IT'S TIME FOR SHA SHA SHA NO ONE LISTENS TO THEM OLD HAGS ANYMORE (seriously, I saw comments on Uhm Jung Hwa's performance like that)  
3. Be delulu. JeNnIe Is JuSt TiReD. SEUNGRI OPPA DID NOTHING WRONG (seriously, how?) and most common of all: assuming every group member can sing/dance/idol. 
4. Complain about your English. Seriously, what a better way to gain attention and sympathy by sharing how apparently bad your English is! So many posts and comments end with 'Sorry for my bad English'. COME ON IT'S NOT THAT BAD. WE CAN READ AND UNDERSTAND. IT'S NOT TERRIBLE AT ALL.  
5. The most important thing: NEVER BUY ANYTHING ORIGINAL. The only k-pop products you buy are bootleg stuff on online warehouses and you illegally download their music. Oh I'm sorry you're probably a 15 year old in a third world country (refer to no. 4) that can't afford your meals anyway. And you wonder why your favourite groups never win 1st place.

Did I miss any stars past or present? I couldn't find an official account for Tzuyu

Honestly, I'm a little surprised that Victoria has the most followers. Didn't know she was that popular in China.

Group like SNSD who basically divide the girls into vocal line and dance line are easier to decide. But other group not so much, because some of the members are just there to be cute and funny.

Example, I just spent 2-3 hours on youtube and had some bizarre streak of watching interviews/gossip videos that I am still trying to comprehend...e.q.:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Jeon Soyeon saying she is ugly...lol no comment
2. Dara saying she is fan of some random foreigner (Samm Hammington, google him maybe), his reaction was non-chalent ""really...""
3. Red Velvet go to europe and get super flirty with some random foreigner who didn't even know who they are
4. This one was actually sad:

Aereum from T-ARA having felt low enough to be contestant on some american-idol like show where Hyuna was supposed to be her mentor/judge. I thought it's weird for idol from former top group to be judged by another idol hoping to 'pass the singing'.

This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",31,27

I know about no trainee debt because they are considered investments but how does being a part of the big 3 almost guarantee sucess. Maybe they have more money to promote and have better production? I'm asking cause when I talked to a friend about Itzys win streak they mention it's the power of JYP. Is it cause the big 3 have fans that are loyal to the company? Do they also have better ways to promote than smaller companies? I'm from US and get most of my kpop info from Reddit so any new group that debuts i think jm exposed to them but Is it different in Korea? Would these groups from smaller companies be considered indie groups since they aren't as mainstream as the big 3?,1,1

2073,2019-03-17,2019,3,17,0,b1tiw7,"How my wife turned me, a metal-loving music fan into a kpop fan",Alaskan_Lost,1552749566,"I grew up listening to anything metal/rock. I spent 20 years listening to the same 50 songs over and over and as time went on I would stop turning on the radio. I was getting tired of the same songs on rotation for years upon years. When she started to listen to kpop I rolled my eyes wouldn't even give it a chance. As time went on I would find that kpop songs were stuck in my head and I found it annoying. You're not going to hit me with that Du-dudu-du-du. I'm too much of a man for that.

That's when she started explaining things like ""bias's"" to me and she forced me to pick one. I chose Wendy from Red Velvet cause, cute. About two weeks later I was singing Ice Cream Cake in my head. Then it was TT by Twice. Then I heard Black Pink and I was like wow. The beats are amazing. The way the songs were arranged was amazing. But what I noticed is, I had a new love of music. I have never heard anything like that before and was finding myself reading about the bands online and looking up songs. I must have listened to CLC - I like it 500 times in two weeks. I was hooked. But I was too ashamed to play it in the car with the windows down for fear of looking like less of a man. That soon changed.

Look, I'm not good at saying what I feel the correct way. I know this post is in terrible format but the point is that now I love kpop. I love the fans. I love the fact that I can enjoy music again and have this huge catalog of new songs (new to me anyway) that I can enjoy. I no longer get annoyed by whats on the radio because it's now usually a kpop song I haven't heard. I roll down the windows and blast Very, very, very. I crank up CLC - No. I love me some Twice. And I've started to like boy bands in kpop because they don't mess around. They just shred those lyrics. 

So, thank you kpop for giving me my love of music back. Thank you for welcoming a metal loving guy into the fold. And thank you, Wendy for being awesome. I'm now just a music lover not a metal/rock lover. I found out that no matter how old I am I still can learn something new. And I'm excited for US tours of bands because WENDY SIGN MY SHIRT!!  

And mostly, thank you to my wonderful wife for opening my eyes and sharing something she loves with her husband. It's helped our relationship grow because we have more to share with each other. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. ",4,11

I dont know if this is the correct subreddit to post this, although i did read the rules on discussions, i it isnt please remove it, thanks! 

With the Burning Molka scandal going on right now and more and more kpop celebrities being accused and incriminated in this, what do you think should be the correct line of action when it comes to discontinuing your support for the groups some of the suspects are from( eg. CN BLUE, HIGHLIGHT, BIg BANG, FT ISLAND, etc) ? 

I, personally 100% condemn anyone who has had part in this scandal and think they are awful people for doing this, but Ive been debating if I should completely stop listening to the groups music even though only one member was involved.
This debate began for me when Lee Jonghyun (CN BLUE)  was found to have participated in the group chats. 
I have close to 100 songs of CN BLUEs on my phone, and they owere one of the first groups ive listened to when i begun to like Kpop. Deleting all of them and never listening to them again would break my heart because they are a part of my childhood, but on the other hand i feel like this is the morally correct thing to do. 

I would like to hear others thoughts on this. What will you do about this?

2091,2019-03-17,2019,3,17,3,b1vlun,"Who is the best leader in k-pop in your opinion, and why?",sleepydvamain,1552761199,"Im always interested to see peoples take on this. I have a habit of biasing leaders in groups (GD, Leeteuk, Suho.. the list goes on) and I just wanna know what you guys think as to who holds the group together the best and why you think theyre a good leader? 

For me, I would have to say SHINees Onew and Super Juniors Leeteuk. 

Onew because hes kept the boys together over the last year, in most cases with some groups if something happened like what happened to them they almost certainly wouldve disbanded. But he kept them together and they made some amazing music last summer because of it. 

Leeteuk, I think because he himself has been through so much himself, with all the things that have happened between the members which they are very vocal about that they have disagreements and fights sometimes and that its okay. Hes pulled them from almost disbanding countless times, gone through so many scandals and kept them together. I always get teary eyed when I remember how when their car crash happened he made sure everyone else was taken care of before himself. I just have so much unending respect for him, he is such a strong person and he has done so much for his members and they all talk about him with such love and admiration and you can just tell that they really see eachother as brothers and have a bond not a lot of groups have. 

Sorry for the ramble! But I pass the question to you guys: Do you agree? Who is the best leader in your opinion? ",1,1

Not based on popularity, but who has been able to keep the group together through hardships and such the best and who is the best at taking care of their members? 

In my opinion, its either Leeteuk of Super Junior or Onew of SHINee. 

Onew has done so much for them in spite of everything that happened. I believe he is such a strong person for being there for the other boys through the last couple years and making sure they stick together. 

Leeteuk I feel the same, SuJu have been through so much together and you can really tell that they love eachother like brothers and family. Leeteuk has given so much for the rest of the group and the way that they talk about and admire him gets me so emotional. I have unending respect for how much strength he has as a person, and I wish more people would acknowledge him for that.

2134,2019-03-17,2019,3,17,17,b233df,190316 VIP EXPERIENCE SUNMI TORONTO TOUR 2019,OG_etherealbangtan,1552810787,"#**PRE-CONCERT**

**SUNMI WORLD TOUR 2019**

-	To provide background info, basically this concert was really important that I end up buying 3 tickets and sell 2 tickets to get a front row seat

-	The last seat i had was Row A Section 17 and let me tell you how vast the difference was during the concert.

#CONCERT

-	Since the venue was held in Toronto and I live hours away. I decided to commute approximately 4 hours before the show starts to give me some time

-	somehow my imbecile ass decides to go to quick route and solely trust on google maps cause you know..commuting life.

-	I somehow ended in the airport and dont even ask me how I got to that point bc I dont know it for myself. I decided to uber to the venue bc I was really desperate to be not late since I have a good seat.

-	When going to the venue, lines were organized and they were not hostile compare to the other concert which is great. Got a wristband and banner in the entrance. Also i feel like the process is so smooth for VIP since it is seated. (Idk tbh if that makes difference)

-	Honestly when the music starts to blare loudly and intro vcr starts playing, everyone lost their composure and I literally lost my shit like idk what to do

-	Everyone just started screaming her name and when she just walk in the stage for entrance she dominated it! Every step and little turn and actions she did is literally captivating because her presence is overwhelming.

-	I was just awe in the whole time that I didnt how to react like a proper human and start malfunctioning and screamed like a little girl (its so embarrassing) but seeing sunmi makes you feel to let loose of everything.

-	Im not even kidding of how much fan service front row get. Now i know why people are so dedicated to getting it and I have underestimated it three times. First, i interacted with her by giving her finger heart and she responded with a finger heart back. I literally died and melted in the ground.

-	Secondly during recording fancams the amount of eye contact you get is intense. She was literally so near my phone and she almost winked directly. I should have fainted but I need to watch the rest of the concert.

-	Secondly, I said small things continuously since everyone started doing it. I shouted really beautiful and also when she was drinking water bottle she asked the audience if they were thirsty and hot. I said Sunmi youre hot and she responded back with thank you.

-	What I really like about this concert is she spent a lot of time talking to fans (directly in the front row), you just feel so connected with her and feel her genuine reaction that she loves her fans

-	I remember some girl said in korean that she doesnt have the sunmi sticker like her teaser. She responded with just draw on your face (lmao queen  )

-	Beside that she also said she was sick and had cold and drink (5 energy/medicine bottles to get cured). Tbh i hope she gets rest during tours and enjoy the place too

-	idk why but every performance she did, her energy just keeps growing and growing like it never runs out. I thought it was the opposite but I commend her for putting every ounce of her effort and energy at every performance.

-	Its so different seeing her dance at a really close view especially mine. Her movements are so fluid and she is so expressive at every actions she execute. She masters her expression so well that she ends up being cute and hot at the same time.

-	During the intermissions, I really appreciate her trying to say English to connect with her fans. It was so amazing how in the break, she is so adorable and goofy but in performance, she is so dominant and charismatic

-	Tbh i feel really bad if you were beside me and I couldnt help singing horribly and shouting like a little girl. It was really amazing to experience a performer in close proximity. Distance do really make a lot of difference. Im taking this time to apologize if i ruin your concert experience lol.

#After-Performance

-	tbh it was messy since there was 4 lines and going to different routes every time but I managed to just follow the flow since I was really satisfied on how this concert was handled. Along with great performance from background dancers ( You guys rock for making Sunmi dance more cohesive and captivating! Thank you so much for your dancing efforts)

-	During the high five it was finally my turn but the high-five was done within 1 second for most people.

-	When it was my turn, she put on an angelic smile and i did the finger hearts again and she responded back the same.

-	The embarrassing part is imagine a 511 guy running and squealing like a little girl. Im pretty sure she makes everyone feel that on inside but I always lose my composure around her. Her presence is so overwhelming that you just want to stare at her for a long time and see her perform. This kind of ability is amazing!!!!

2165,2019-03-17,2019,3,17,22,b2585r,Rant about the Korean music industry,ISawTheAkma,1552829825,"Before I start let me say that the opinions I have are completely personal. I am a Korean-American dual citizen that lived in Korea for about 12 years during my childhood and the rest of my life in the States. I have grown up listening to kpop and idol music was the first introduction to mainstream music in any kind (the first song I remember hearing is ""How to avoid the sun"" so you can guess how old I am by that). 

While I grew up listening to rain, tvxq, wonder girls and snsd, I started to dislike and distance myself from idols as I grew older and was exposed to western mainstream music around middle school. This was because idol music just sounded like tacky remakes of western style pop. Because of this I stopped listening to Korean music completely. It wasnt until I entered high school that I started to listen to Korean music again and it was by pure accident. An old Korean friend of mine that I haven't talked to since my elementary school days found me on kakao and we started catching up. The subject moved on to music and he said he discovered this old music duo called vibe and was listening to them non stop. He recommended me the song ""alchohol"", and like that I got hooked on Korean ballads. I started to listen to Vibe, Park Hyoshin, Lim Changjung and later on artists such as Jung Seunghwan, Lee hi, Isu, Monday Kiz. I loved the lyrics that were so touching, so poetic, that I feel only the Korean language can properly convey, I loved the build up that ballads had, that perfect high note that gives the emotional climax leaving you with ecstasy. This was the Korean music I listened to and loved. ""Breathe"" was the song that got me through my grandpa's death and still makes me well up during hard times.

However, as you know this is not the Korean music that non koreans are familiar with. When most westerners think of Korean music they think of BTS, Big Bang and Blackpink. They think that Korean music solely consists of Kpop and idols. A whole country's music industry has been stereotyped to be a single genre. It's fine that idols are popular and I understand why they're popular, the idols are attractive, they dance well and the songs they put out are catchy and trendy. I am not ok with the fact that idols dominate the music industry. In Korea, a-list idols are simply too big to fail. They will always be in the top charts because their fandom will stream a group's song night and day regardless of the quality of the song with out really listening to it(I feel like this is horribly unethical). This means that non-idol singers who do not have a dedicated fandom cannot breakthrough to the charts unless the song is abnormally good(gift, melomance), related to a famous celebrity(like it, Yoon Jong shin) or in the case of Nilo doing exactly what the idol fandoms do, but apparently it's not ok when you pay the guys to stream it, non-stop streaming is a-okay if the motive is blind fanatical love. Same goes for YouTube views. This isnt to say that there aren't genuinely good idol groups out there, Big Bang and BTS have great songs and stand out from other groups with their unique take on kpop. Zico gave me appreciation for Korean idol rap same with Bobby and Mino. I am saying that the idol groups have oversaturated the music industry and as result the industry as a whole is affected

This domination of music charts by idols have a adverse effect to the whole industry. First it decreases the quality of the music that comes out and makes the songs more or less the same. Because why try to be different when the quality of the song dont necessarily matter only that it brings more into the fandom. Second the idol dominated industry encourages physical beauty than actual musical talent. Let's be real, kpop would not have as big as it is if it wasn't for the beauty of idols. The ent. companies care more about how a singer look while he/she performs rather than the songs themselves. This also give pressure to trainees to go through extensive surgery and psychological pain to become beautiful. When was the last time that you saw a ugly artist in Korean music that wasnt already a veteran in the field. Third, in the current culture surrounding the ent. companies especially the smaller ones is heavily based around sexual exploitation of the idols and trainees. While large ent. companies are rich and influential enough to not need to use their idols to sexually entertain business partners smaller companies are not so. It's even evident in Seungri gate that sexual entertainment of business partners are a part of Korean business culture. And ent. companies with large pools of vulnerable, exploitable, attractive women are prime places for sex trafficking to take place.

My hope is that Seungri gate will effect the industry enough that it affects the big ent. companies and Korean music can take on a more diverse identity than pretty people dancing prettily to catchy music.",4,0

My favorite example is the EXID Hani solo song [Milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UGXcPKOKk). She's talking about needing milk but it sounds like she's saying ""ooh you"" which also completely works within the meaning of the song.

I'm sure it was intentional in the case of this song, but I'll accept accidental examples as well.",55,77

A lot of people call NCT weird and not public friendly which i think just means they arent cutesy. For some odd reason its like a meme to hate the song Regular by them which I think is one of their best songs! Is it that theyre weird in the context of kpop? Because truth be told, no group in SM is as experimental to me as f(x). I dont know if its a matter of taste or what, but personally I dont think NCT is wayyyy out there and SOOO SUPER EXPERIMENTAL that it turns off hella people from listening. 7th sense just sounds like a hip hop song. Without you is just....a type of rock. Come Back is pretty catchy, wtf about it is experimental?? 

I know i have focused mainly on NCT here but whatever i said already can apply to RV as well. Im just not sure what everyones talking about and I might be the dumb one here if the majority is able to pick this up and not me",13,0

My first thought was Treasure, because they are set to debut this year, in the midst of YGs decline. Will their debut even happen? (YG has a history of cancelling debuts- Mixnine) If they debut, will they even be successful?

My next thought was Blackpink. Theyre doing really well internationally, but this scandal is causing investors that they brought in (Louis Vuitton) to withdraw their support for the company. Will Blackpink keep seeing success if the company is losing the investors? (especially the ones they brought in)

Even Winner and iKon, who have been steadily growing in popularity for the last few years may be affected heavily by YGs controversy. 

How do you think YG artists will be affected by this controversy?",13,0

**Before The Concert**

I live several hours away from Toronto, but my parents live on the outskirts of the Toronto area, so I travelled there the day before the concert. It was so warm that day that I only brought a light jacket with me. The day of the concert though it was cold again and snowing, so like the idiot I am I still went and stood in line outside and braved the frost bite because we knew the concert merch would be gone quickly once the doors opened (this was true!!) as well as some people giving away/selling fangoods in line. The organizers of the fan project were out there running around and working hard giving out banner slogans. The ticket-checking going into the venue was very organized and fast. In the end I didnt end up getting the concert shirt because Im trying to save up for other things, but I got the socks because I love socks and my feetsies are nice and warm wrapped in socks that say MIYAYEAH as I type this up.

I was chatting with the person next to me in line. Hes been a diehard fan of Wonder Girls since 2008. He brought his official WG fanlight!! This thing you cannot find for sale ANYWHERE now (Ive looked). I asked if I could hold it and he said of course. I just had to take a [picture](https://imgur.com/a/sOkHVf6) of myself holding the fanlight because I really doubt Ill be able to find one ever so its probably not going to happen again haha.

Id never been to a show at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre before, so I had no idea what the seats would be like. In two words: VERY squishy. I managed to get a central seat, but that required me to pull a [Bugs Bunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys4JFRFRkpY) to get to it since I went to my seat just before the show started and most other people were in their seats already oops lol. I was only about 5 or 6 rows from the stage though!! The lack of foot-room didnt matter much as soon as the concert started and people started standing up.

**The Concert**

* After a short video, Sunmi came on and the first song was 24 Hours, just to make sure you were aware that she is *the* queen of stage presence. 
* Curve () was next and I was so mesmerized that all I remember was she had this lacy black blindfold thing on killed us all when she ripped it off in the last part of the song.
* WHO AM I!!! I hadnt looked at the setlist before the show and Who Am I is my favourite song of hers and I just wasnt expecting it and Im still not over it. I didnt record a lot but this is the one song that I recorded semi-well enough to upload as a fancam (link below).
* Before the show the fan project team gave out slips of blue, pink, and purple coloured paper to hold over our phone flashlights during Black Pearl. It looked like she really loved this, after the song she said something like I have all you beautiful pearls \[gesturing to us\] Im rich!.
* She talked and interacted with the crowd a lot. I was surprised there was no translator as I know shes not fully comfortable with English (and I remember seeing KpopMe put out a call for translators for a number of the dates on the tour?), but she did so well without one and the crowd was generally patient when she paused to think of what to say.
* She introduced Borderline as a song she wrote herself. When we cheered when she announced it, she asked You know Borderline? \[cheers\] Really? \[cheers\] because its not out yet. \[.sheepish cheers\]
* The crowd yelling/singing along to Noir seemed to even startle her a bit. I think she said something like wow, my ears exploded afterwards haha
* Full Moon, I dont have anything else to say except I cant believe I saw Full Moon performed live and she did the rap part herself and sounded great!!
* During Addict, we were instructed by the fan project team to hold up the reverse side of the banners they gave out that said Canadian fans will be with you forever. I was holding mine up but most of the people in front of me were filming and didnt, so I hope more people behind me did  She did point out the banners eventually but not during that song.
* For Gashina I was so absorbed I dont remember anything other than it being awesome.
* There was another break after this where she talked with us. I think it was during this time at some point a chant of Lee-Sun-Mi! started, and she giggled and eventually started kind of dancing to the beat of the chant before making us stop haha.
* She was so funny. I cant 100% remember how this started, but I think this is it. She had us sing the lines of the chorus of Gashina with her again afterwards. She pointed out one person near the front who wasnt moving their mouth at all during this. She looked kind of sly and asked him if he was not having fun, and then asked if he knew her name.  She teased him for a bit but made sure to say Joking! Im joking! Not serious\~ after she made him blush.
* She said she was going to sing a couple of songs from the 80s. I was born in 1992 Im old she giggled before.
* Georgy Porgy and Im Not In Love, oh my word. I need a specifically 80s concept from her as a solo artist now, she is so good with them.
* Heroine was around the time some really tall guy saw this relatively nice empty space in front of me that gave me a nice field of view and stood in it with his phone held up high. Thanks, dude!! Heroine slayed though.
* Hey You sounds so cool and I cant wait for her next album!!
* Burn, holy crap, however hard I was expecting that to go, it went even harder. Lights flashing, bass thumping, she and the dancers had us jumping up and down. Definitely the most fun moment of the night to me.
* She had one last, LONG talking bit before Siren. She was joking around some more, and eventually said I should be a stand-up comedian. (She could do it, I believe in her). She said in Korea she feels more boring, but in North America she feels like a fun person.
* Siren was so fun, Im pretty sure she saw me doing the dance in the chorus part and smiled at me ;\~;
* At the end of the show she had the dancers all come back on and introduced them. They were all amazing and Im kind of fans of them now but I didnt catch all their names! D:
* Someone gave them all flowers and it was so sweet! Sunmi got teared up while thanking everyone and the crowd and she just kind of looked at the crowd for a moment to take it all in.
* The encore was so fun, Gashina again but this time the male and female dancers switched roles. The well-built manly dancers giggling shyly while dancing beside her were so cute.

**Post-Concert (Hi-Touch)**

After the concert there was some minor confusion about how to lineup for the hi-touch just because there were so many of us and not a lot of room. Once they got the line sorted out it went really smoothly. It went so fast. I wanted to say a full sentence to her but they were really hurrying people along and also in her presence you just cant help but have your brain melt so all I managed was a thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou as I high fived her and she looked at me like aww thank you!!

That's all I can manage! **TL;DR:** She was amazing, stage presence was out of this world, she was so kind, she deserves the world, please stream Noir on Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, and iTunes. &lt;3

I often find myself really interested in particular members from groups I dont stan or dont really follow that closely.

Some of mine would be Dahyun from Twice. Ive always thought her looks were super unique and pretty, and the way she can spot a camera from like a mile away is hilarious.

Chuu from Loona is also just plain adorable, and shes got an amazing voice as well! I remember finally watching Heart Attack m/v a few months before Loonas official debut as a group and shes got so much charisma and charm, even in just the m/v.

Also Mark Lee from NCT. I just find his way of talking/overall personality really cute (I know hes sometimes clowned for it lmao), but also hes got some crazy work ethic and talent. I think back to SM live last year when he was doing 8 different stages as a part of NCT 127, NCT U, and NCT dream. He still somehow manages to keep all the dances/lyrics straight and has such a bright personality through all of it. major props to that kid.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First here's the schedule of the event:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*12pm\*\*: Doors open

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*1pm\*\*: Tournament starts

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*5pm\*\*: Finalists are announced

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*6pm\*\*: Panel decision with NINJA and iKON

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*6:20pm\*\*: Finals begin

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*7:10pm\*\*: iKON performs

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*7:45pm\*\*: NINJA meet and greet

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*8pm\*\*: Event ends

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*8am\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

So I arrived to Samsung 837. The doors open at 12pm. There were people who camped at like 3pm on the day before which was insane. So I arrived and around the door, there wasn't even a line. It was more of like a jumble of people. A line did start to form out of it along the side. So there was probably like 70 people or so in front of me? I heard that there was a second line that formed on the other side of the building but was told it was the wrong on so they got fuck over and had to go to the back of the line I was in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that it's like 20 to 30 degrees out here.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*10am\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The employees come out and start to organize the line into 2. The first is the line where people who register to play in the tournament. The second is for the spectators which the majority of people here are. It was never stated that gamers get first priority to enter the building before anyone else. So the people who camped that didn't register into the tournament were screwed. Now you didn't have to actually play in the tournament and some ikonics were smart to enter so they could get in first (even if they didn't camp). There was about 40 people who were actually gonna play in the tournament.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*11:30pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the line is very long at this point. About 100 people in front of me because of the gamer line and Probably 200 people behind me so the spectator line grew very fast in a couple of hours. During this, we notice a huge black bus start turning the corner. As it passes in front of us, we noticed that the boys were in it!!! I saw Song very clearly and I couldn't tell who was in front of him but he had a brown coat. Everyone screamed like hell and it honestly made us feel alot more better about being in the cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right before 12pm hits, Bobby comes out of no where, shows up to the front door, right in front of the line, and runs in. It was so random and I think he was teasing us lmaoo.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*12pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

They slowly start letting people in. The gamer line goes first in groups of 10ish.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*12:30pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I finally get let in. The building has 3 floors: the ground floor (2nd floor), the stage floor (1st floor) and the 3rd floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically this is where all my complaints are. The 1st floor is where iKON and NINJA will appear to battle the finalists and the performance (this has a seated section). It also has the Korean BBQ on this floor. The 2nd is for some activities (basically where everyone is). The 3rd is for food and gamers. 

&amp;#x200B;

2nd and 3rd floors are all balcony standing. This is not a concert venue, it's a store with a small ""stage"". Here's a \[picture\]([http://wonder-wall.com/static-data/assets/4/a5a349c360c5744c2feed9a42ddd89a49dfe45b6\_q90/W1601\_15alltop\_B5A3703.jpg](http://wonder-wall.com/static-data/assets/4/a5a349c360c5744c2feed9a42ddd89a49dfe45b6_q90/W1601_15alltop_B5A3703.jpg)) of the floors to give you an idea.

&amp;#x200B;

First off to even get in the seated section/1st floor, you need to have registered in the tournament. So remember all the people who camped for a good spot and didn't register? They are screwed. Also the kbbq is also only for gamers, which was never stated ANYWHERE. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 3rd floor has the bathrooms and a small cafe. Everyone can use the bathrooms and order from the cafe but the balconies on that floor are only for gamers. Again, never stated anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically if you didn't register for the tournament and you weren't let in first, there was no way in hell anyone was gonna see anything on that stage on the 2nd floor. There was just way too many people and I don't think they expected to have so many people. (Which I don't get because this is a kpop group and kpop fans are wild so expect alot lmao)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Already 2 hours in and the line outside is still long as hell. I have no idea if they stopped letting people in or they slowly are but it was really getting full in here. About 300 or more inside. We secured our spot on the 2nd floor behind a girl who was nice enough to let us see a bit since me and my 2 friends are very short but it wasn't that great. There is no seating anywhere except on the 1st floor. So I have basically been standing since 8am. We sit on the floor and about 10 mins later we were told not to sit. Alot of the girls around me snapped at the employee. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now before, in order to go upstairs, you can ask an employee to go up to the bathrooms and they will let you normally. At this time they all of sudden starting checking if people were gamers and stopped letting other non gamers up. This is complete bullshit because the bathrooms and cafe is up there which is open to everyone??? So in order to go up, the girl in front of us let me use her gamer wrist band to go up to the floor to get food with my friend (who doesn't have a wrist band) for everyone. They didn't check my friend so ???? we were let up anyway. It's super confusing and annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

As we are on the 3rd floor, the balcony up here has alot of space left because most of the people are focusing on playing. So we are waiting in line at the cafe and I had an idea. I wanted to see if I could still enter the tournament and get access to this balcony. I looked it up and I entered in under a minute (it was free to enter btw). Literally 2 hours after the tournament started. IT WAS THAT EASY. I gave my friend the wrist band, told her to wait in line still to see if I actually pulled it off so that she can do it too. I stepped out of line and entered the line for registration. I went up to the guy, he checked my confirmation email, gave me my lanyard badge, a food voucher, and off I went. Instantly had access to the tournament area/balcony. I couldn't believe that's all I had to do. They didn't give me a wrist band tho and said they ran out of them which is fine because the badge is really what you need right now. I went to my friend (she had already gotten the food) and told her to enter right away. Went back down and told my other friend and everyone else I made friends with to enter so we can get upstairs.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3:30pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I got access to the first floor. Now I cant sit here because everything is full so. But I did get access to the kbbq! That's what the food voucher was for. You get to pick whatever you wanted in your bowl and a drink. Completely free.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back up to the 3rd floor to secure a spot for everyone. It's sorta far up, but it's honestly better than looking between people's heads as a 5 foot shorty lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we just wait till 6pm for iKON.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*6:10pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

They finally show up right after NINJA comes out. Let me tell you they are STUNNING!!!! Bobby and DK were all smiles. Hanbin and Jinhwan did seem a bit tired. Junhoe and Song were quiet mostly. Chanwoo took that center because it was basically his event since the Fortnite skin was based off of him. It was a beautiful sight to see lmaoo. 

&amp;#x200B;

DK and Bobby spoke most of the time. Hanbin did speak a bit. When I noticed that Song wasn't getting much attention, me and my friend decided to call his name and see if he notices us. So we did and he instantly looked up at us and waved!! I was absolutely SCREAMING! After a bit, the boys leave the stage. Bobby did trip over one of the lights on the ground but he's completely fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*6:30pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The finalists come out and take their seats to play. NINJA walks out followed by DK, Chanwoo, and Hanbin. They go to a small platform at the center and there was podium where the phones are set up. As they were waiting to play, me and my friends called out DK's name and he looked up and pointed at us &lt;3. Everything was now ready and the finals began. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was probably the most excited I've ever been over a Fortnite match lmao. Their phone screens were broadcasted on this bigger screen behind them. DK and Hanbin were racking up about 2 to 3 kills while Chanwoo wasn't doing so hot :(. Every once in a while, Hanbin would look like his neck is in pain. The podium must have been too short for him or something else. I hope he's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't remember who won exactly but I think I remember the boys winning against NINJA. They definitely looked like they had fun! The whole room kept chanting DK! DK! DK! So he definitely felt all the love and hype &lt;3 Hanbin did look at me briefly in between a match. &lt;3 They leave the stage. The Little platform in the center gets dissembled to prepare for the mini concert.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*7:20pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

All the boys come out and they perform Love Scenario. Everyone goes absolutely INSANE. The fanchants and singing along just rocked that place. After the song ends they introduce themselves, talk for a bit and all of them leave the stage except for Hanbin. 

&amp;#x200B;

To our surprise, he then begins to perform his solo songs, One And Only and BE I. The hype in this room was unreal! So his solo stage ends, leaves, and Bobby comes out. 

&amp;#x200B;

He then performs UP and HOLUP.  Now HOLUP is my hype anthem and it was a dream of mine to hear it live. So you best believe I cried happy tears over this. He splashed water on the front row and slipped over the water on the stage. That boy walked it off like it was nothing. He was ok thank god. Bobby absolutely LOVED looking up at the top floor for some reason so he briefly looked at me during this &lt;3. He probably saw my ugly crying ass so I'm so sorry Bobby lmaoo. 

&amp;#x200B;

So his stage ends and the rest of the boys come out. They perform Bling Bling and Rhythm Ta. They didn't do the choreo but just had fun and interacted with the crowd. DK and Hanbin both walked up the stairs leading to the 2nd floor and touched everyone's hands there. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*7:50pm\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The performance ends. They boys say their goodbyes and walk off. Everyone then starts to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Overall\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

It started off a huge mess and almost became unworth it. If I hadn't tried to enter the tournament, I would have not been able to see even a glimpse of the boys. I'm so happy this event was free because of 2 things. 1, because of how unorganized it was. 2, because I got to see a YG group for free (even if it was short), which is completely unheard of! The boys did amazing so I was completely happy in the end. &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

The whole event was livestreamed on \[twitch\]([https://www.twitch.tv/videos/396470602](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/396470602)) including the boys playing and their performance.

Also here's my \[thread\]([https://twitter.com/soapybebe/status/1106934009450426368?s=21](https://twitter.com/soapybebe/status/1106934009450426368?s=21)) on Twitter of my interactions/videos I took during the event. &lt;3",4,41

##YGE is saying that Seungri's actions are outside theirs, and may be planning a 4 member version of BIGBANG.

I've been a fan of kpop for longer than I've identified as bisexual, and initially I didn't interact much with other kpop fans. But once I started talking to other kpop fans in person and online, I've noticed that it seems like a large percentage of them, at least in America, are LGBT+, despite the fact kpop has very few openly LGBT+ idols and the ones that exist aren't incredibly popular. 

I'm not sure if LGBT+ people are actually more likely to be interested in kpop or if there just happened to be a lot of memes about gay idols because of how skinship is in Korea. Or perhaps it has to do with male idols representing a different type of masculinity than what is typically represented in the west. I've just never personally thought my sexuality had anything to do with my music tastes, although who knows, maybe it's just subconscious lol.",51,26

[Suho on Grazia April issue cover](https://i.redd.it/5uslpdn31vm21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Q: The photoshoot started in the afternoon. What did you do before getting to the venue?**JM: Because I got up too early, I went to play basketball, had lunch, and even went to an oriental clinic, which was quite diligent of me.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Then the swelling (tn: that youd have after waking up in the morning) must have disappeared by now? (laugh)**JM: Ive been starting a new diet that matches my body. I usually would eat meat but they said it wasnt right for my type of body (tn: probably metabolism). They said that I should plan my diet primarily based on seafood and white rice now. Ive been eating carbs, which I wouldnt usually eat before, so my body is a bit swollen.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: In one of your previous interviews, you said that one of your mottos is to be present at the moment. What side of yourself do you want to present in todays interview?**JM: I need to be present at the moment but I probably worked out too hard in the morning, my eyes cant be all shiny now (laugh). But fortunately I think my current state matches the concept of todays photoshoot too, so I guess it did my body some good relaxing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You recently attended Bvlgaris B.zero1 20th anniversary event in Rome as Koreas representative.**JM: It doesnt happen everyday that you are invited to attend an overseas event. So it was an experience full of amazement and fun for me. It was also the first time I ever went to Italy so I took the opportunity to enjoy Rome to the fullest before coming back (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Youre also known as one of the humorous members within your team. I feel like I know what that means now.**JM: I havent even started though? Im talking in all seriousness right now (laugh)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Do you normally wear jewelry too?**JM: I have great interest in fashion, but I wasnt that acquainted with jewelry. There was one time when I accidentally had a scratch on my neck during a dance session, so I became more careful after that. But then thanks to this event, I got to wear rings and necklace(s), and they seemed to look nice on me. Hahaha  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Yeah I watched that live broadcast where you showed your ring too (laugh).**JM: It kinda matched the look that I went for that day so I wanted to brag a little bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You did some travelling with your friend after finishing the schedule, normally its not easy for you to travel around, isnt it?**JM: I do travel once in a while. Ive been planning my vacations ever since the 4th year after my debut. I personally love travelling, so I took the time to form a group with my friends and travel every year. But still, this was the first proper Europe trip with a friend.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Not only Rome, you took your time to travel every corner of Venice too. Whats your travelling type?**JM: I wasnt the type who would plan my itinerary so thoroughly in the past. That resulted in me belatedly knowing that the place I just came back from was a very famous place, or there was a god restaurant near my hotel that I passed by without knowing. It was kinda upsetting and such a pity. (Because) When would I ever get the chance to visit that city again. Its really true that you only feel and see as much as you know. That was when I started to plan my travels and do my research diligently before going somewhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Where was the most memorable place from this trip?**JM: My favorite spot was Colosseum. We unintentionally went there 3 times, but if it makes you go Wow\~ looking from the outside, once you get inside, it gives you this unexplainable vibe. I didnt have my expectations high but once I was inside, the scenes from the movies , , the series came to mind one by one and matched with what I saw, so it was a very interesting experience. It felt so incredible, the fact that thousands of people from the B.C times would come to this huge building, sit here and cheer as they watched the matches.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats your next destination?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Im thinking Paris. Ive been there once but I just travelled around without a guide, so its a shame that I couldnt feel much. This time I plan to go on a guided tour and also visit the nearby city where Van Gogh, my favorite artist, used to live before he passed away. And to view his artworks too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: You put Su-hwak-haeng in your instagram profile. Whats your trivial happiness these days? (tn: su-hwak-haeng is a wordplay with so-hwak-haeng, which stands for the guaranteed happiness that comes from small/trivial things)**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think I just feel happy after having a day a little well-spent. When I lie on my bed before sleep, watching Netflix, after spending time well. That really is the moment of happiness, isnt it? (laugh)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats Suhos typical well-spent day like?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I do a lot of sports, including fitness. Also for my lyrics composing, whenever I come up with something, I write it down. I meet my friends, we watch movies and share our stories, too. Or if theres someone in the group with an audition coming up, we would help him with script reading too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Throughout the interview, I kept thinking that you reminded me of someone, then I realized that your voice or your vibe really resembles your close friend, Byun Yohans. Do you grow to be alike as much as you are close?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: My brother said the same thing too A few people said something similar too. Is it because I do script readings with him frequently (laugh)? But as you get to know us, we always have big differences.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Is there something youre into these days?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: These days its basketball. My goal is to work hard and level up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats at the center of Suhos life at the moment? Have you ever thought about that?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I have my personal ambition regarding acting so Ive been participating in musical and movie works, but the fact that Im EXOs Suho before anything else doesnt change. Also during this Italy trip, I got recognized by many people, I think it was because Im EXO Suho, and the invitation that I got to attend an event overseas was also thanks to my EXO title. Thats why its only natural that I always keep EXO at my center.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: We all know that you call yourself the funniest member in EXO. How would you define your gag code?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Our fans call it the gag pristine area. That its the kind of gag where I dont devalue and hurt any certain person, but only make fun of myself. I personally thins such a innocently funny thing. In itself, its a kind of heavens-helped gag (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Do you know that the very fact that you are explaining it right now is funny too?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Sometimes there are people like that too. They say that whatever I do is just funny. When we did the photoshoot sometime ago too, it seems I was quite interesting. The photographer said that I was interesting even when I just stood still.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Arent you proud of yourself at times like that?**JM: Of course Im happy (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Who has the best understanding of this gag dimension of yours?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Sehunnie really likes it. Our codes really match well.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Then whos the most incompatible member?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think its Chanyeol. Chen used to not match either but now hes come to understand my code (laugh). But Chanyeolie seems to never get it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: I think its not an overstatement to say that the relationships among EXO members now are like a family. When are the times when you are reminded oh so well that As expected, we are one team.?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Recently we got the chance to gather all the members after 2 weeks. It was such a happy and interesting time. Of course we ended up playing games that time too, and I dont know why but I ended up last place.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Was it because the members kept tackling you?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think eventualy its because I take it well. And my reaction is good too. You know there are also people who pull a stern face and hate it when you joke around. But as for me, I dont act like that as long as it doesnt go too far. I think they tend to especially act like that more because they want to see my reaction.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Dont you ever think I want to get down from the leader position now?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I dont know if its because of the years weve been working, but now be it the members or the company, they always come to discuss with me first. But these days Ive been thinking, that even if I werent the leader, they wouldve done that same. Its tiring at times, but at the same time its rewarding too, that So Ive lived a good life. I dont think the situation would change much even if I were to retreat from the leader position now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: If theres something you wish from the members as the leader?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: We play games a lot, but I wish they started to learn how to lose now. You know people say losing is actually winning. To be honest, there were many times when I intentionally lost. More that feeling happy from winning in a game, I would hate it more to see the members who have strong desire for winning being upset from losing. Rather than I need to win even if I have to die, it feels more at ease to just let others win (laugh).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: I guess its the leaders consideration.**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think its just my personality. Ive been like that ever since I was small. Even when we played games where we bet a jjajjangmyeon, my friends would fight and end up injuring themselves. So I never joined (such games).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whos the EXO member with a particularly strong desire for winning?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Its Chanyeol (laugh). As for me and Kyungsoo, we have no desire to win, nor are we interested. Anyways, my hope is that they would learn the happiness when you lose intentionally for others sake. Haha.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Just 1 year after you challenged yourself in the musical field with in 2017, you ascended to star in . You even won yourself many newcomer awards. It must mean that you got your recognition now, right?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I think to some people, Im forever an acting idol who came from an idol group. Thats all the more reason I feel thankful being awarded. Because it means that I got recognized a little as a musical actor. I know very well that with every award comes the responsibility and pressure, so I need to work even harder in the future. Because Im a new actor who just starts now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Youd hinted a few times that you wanted to work with seniors. Now that it finally came true, what did you learn from them personally?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: Ive learned so many things. Jung Sunah nuna especially pointed things out and helped me meticulously. She would make precise comments like You was slower than the beat in here. Even in the middle of the actual show too (laugh). I learned a lot from observing how the seniors did it, and all the process of working together together with them became such great energy to me. I was able to learn from watching carefully every move of Park Hyoshin hyung as he did it. Haha. I think I worked hard to try to catch up through that process of watching them for reference, then reinterpreting it in my own way.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: 2018 was a year that you worked hard not only in EXOs activities but also as an individual. What kind of plan do you have for this year?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: So far theres no exactly finalized plan. Its just that I really want to work on a movie or a drama, and a musical is a good idea too. EXO also has plans to show various sides of us.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: If you could choose, what kind of face would you want to meet the viewers with?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I dont particularly look for a certain character. But I do hope that its not one that is too stiff. I want to act someone whos flexible, mischievious, and shows their emotions well. But I dont want it to be another cool character again. Because its kinda burdensome. Haha.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats the picture that Suhos visualizing for the future to come?**JM: I want to become someone of positive influence, who sets a precedent. So that I can become a senior who starts and paves the way for my junior colleagues, and is of help to them. For instance I can be of positive influence to my fans or others just by donating or making a volunteer organization. Also, if in the past, when you say you want to be awarded at Cannes or the Oscars, it would be common for people to tell you to stop dreaming, but now, that thought is gradually becoming something realizable, not a dream without any hope. I believe that someday a Korean will make it. And the junior actors who see that will be able to dream bigger dreams.

&gt;**Q: If you could choose, what kind of face would you want to meet the viewers with?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I dont particularly look for a certain character. But I do hope that its not one that is too stiff. I want to act someone whos flexible, mischievious, and shows their emotions well. But I dont want it to be another cool character again. Because its kinda burdensome. Haha.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Whats the picture that Suhos visualizing for the future to come?**  
&gt;  
&gt;JM: I want to become someone of positive influence, who sets a precedent. So that I can become a senior who starts and paves the way for my junior colleagues, and is of help to them. For instance I can be of positive influence to my fans or others just by donating or making a volunteer organization. Also, if in the past, when you say you want to be awarded at Cannes or the Oscars, it would be common for people to tell you to stop dreaming, but now, that thought is gradually becoming something realizable, not a dream without any hope. I believe that someday a Korean will make it. And the junior actors who see that will be able to dream bigger dreams.

**Who are your favorite rappers, and what makes them so good?**

**What are cool things about them?**

**What are styles of rap you enjoy hearing?**

This is the place to monologue about your favorite rappers and point things out about them. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

(Funnily, prior to kpop, I never really appreciated rap that much. Now, it's one of the main ways I gauge a group's sound by.)

&amp;#x200B;

For me, with the above background:

\- BTS rapline: I think they're interesting because they don't really have assigned roles like high tone rappers or low tones, but everyone kinda agrees they're BTS' backbone. I especially love their variety: Suga's laidback drawls, J-Hope's energetic raps, RM's deep musings.

\- SVT rap unit: With the huge number of members, they never really stood out to me as a baby carat, but now they're such highlights of each song. Interesting thing (to me): they straight up sing more than any other rap line I'm aware of. And they all have similar pitches, but you can still differentiate them?",60,50

Personally, I wish that Jin had a solo album. I want to hear some ballads and maybe even a sexy concept song with him. 

Leeteuk I want to hear maybe just a single or two of him doing his own song. I love his singing voice so much I would love to hear it.

Theres hardly any filler between tracks.  
Ive had this idea in mind and Ive even talked about it on here before. I think RV would make a great concept album. Their lyrics would be about the duality of our emotions and the faces we put on and Id love for Yeri to write a ton for this. I imagine something like After Laughter by Paramore. Sweet poppy Red tracks with darker underlying themes followed by dark Velvet tracks with underlying romantic themes. So contrasting sounds versus lyrics. I imagine 11 tracks. A short intro track, 4 Red tracks, a trippy interlude, 4 Velvet tracks, and a short outro track reminscent of the intro, making the album feel like an infinite loop. It would probably be called Bittersweet or something and they would promote double title tracks ( la ICC and Automatic).  
I love kpop but I dont really dig that we dont get that many huge epic albums. I guess thats what we get for wanting so much content ASAP haha. Im guilty of that as well. I know SHINee, EXO, and BTS and many more have released some epic albums though.

Noir has 3.0k upvotes meanwhile Crown only has 1.9k upvotes as of today. And when you look at the top music videos of the sub almost all of them are gg songs. The most upvotes that a boy group MV has had was I think 4.0k. And NCT's newest song is only sitting at around 500-ish upvotes.

* Brown Eyed Girls, anything by them is killer but [Hot Shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBaHGDm6YKQ) is on a whole other level of owning the stage. The whole set up of them in suits, dancing with the ladies, and then when Miryo enters with male dancers backing up, and their totally self-confident almost cocky attitude. The song doesn't even seem well known by i-fans but I love it and how they chose to perform it. This is one of my all time favourite stages.

* [I'll Be Damned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3pCV4SFXrU) by ALi. Her vocals amaze me, so powerful and unique sounding.

* Younha, especially when performing Run [like here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWWxDIhprPw). Her vocals are just so beautiful and seem so effortless even in songs like [ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdCCXU7NvrI) where it seems like she never gets a chance to breathe.

2355,2019-03-19,2019,3,19,9,b2qdya,Review of two different Kpop buying services for TicketBay: KoreanBuddy and Wonderful (Ask Ajumma),Betulaceae,1552955111,"[DISCLAIMER ABOUT BUYING SCALPED TICKETS AND MY FINANCIAL SITUATION]

Before my review, I want to forward with saying I get that scalpers suck, and buying scalped ticket prices probably supports them and they'll continue to scalp tickets. Tickets were originally 33,000 won each, and I paid well over 10x that. But I didn't want to fly all the way to Korea and not go to all days of Caratland. So I either had to trust people on twitter not to scam me, or use a verified buying service like Ticketbay, Stubhub, or Viagogo. Ticketbay + buying service is definitely the cheapest/safest out of those for good seats. 

Also in terms of my finances, I was able to fly for free so I basically put what would have been plane ticket money, back in to buying tickets, I understand these prices were high, but if you're a Carat you know what Caratland means to the fandom, and my seats were good for each day I bought scalped tickets so overall I was happy with the end results.

[END DISCLAIMER]

This will hopefully be a short review to help people understand how to get concert tickets in Korea from a the biggest resale website, TicketBay. Also to compare the prices of the two services I used.  This was for Seventeen's Fanmeeting Caratland. I had gotten one ticket during presale, but it was kinda far away and we were limited to only one ticket for all three shows during presale, and it basically sold out during presale. I wanted to go all 3 days so to scalper land I go......

**Korean Buddy**

I have used KoreanBuddy in the past for clothes/skincare, but this was my first time to use them for concert tickets. They charge a flat 20% of total purchase price for TicketBay. This kinda sucks because the more expensive the tickets you choose, the more of a fee you pay (ahemm at myself). 

I picked a ticket that was 449,000 won, their 20% meant the total was 538,000 won. KoreanBuddy received a commission of 89,000 won. I paid in USD, with the PayPal fee I ended up paying $503.27. I also elected to have the ticket sent to my US home address for another $20, which in hindsight I probably could have had it sent to my hotel like I did with Wonderful lol but it was nice to be holding one ticket as I boarded the plane.

So the good with KoreanBuddy is the flat rate. Lots of things can go wrong with TicketBay, sellers can cancel your purchase with no penalty so it happens. If something did go wrong, KoreanBuddy would work with me to fix it and find new tickets, and then charge their same 20% rate on that ticket. They would have refunded my original $503.27 in full. It fortunately did not happen to me in this case, so I just paid what I paid and got my tickets. I did ask lots fo questions like if hotel or home was better, if the seller cancelled or not, and generally made sure I got a little bit of moneys worth of the fee.  I point this out in comparison to wonderful, which charges by the minute

**Wonderful AKA Ask Ajumma**

So for my next ticket I decided to try Wonderful, which charges by the minute of service. You deposit 4 hours of time, which I guess they have a discount right now for 600 won per minute instead of 800 won, so it was 144,000 won or $128.59 USD. Now the thing with Wonderful is all by the minute, so I was trying really hard to be speedy and short with my usage of the service to save money.

 I found a ticket that was 485,000 won (prices were going up!!). They charge an 8.5% processing fee for credit cards which I was little skeeved about but ticket prices were going up so I was little desperate to get moving.  My total was 526,225 won for the ticket price, which was $469.92 USD. I elected to have my ticket sent to my hotel this time.  After all was said and done, I ended up with 1hour and 5 minutes of work done which is 39,000 won or ~34.43 USD. 

Total ended up being $501.35 USD, very close to KoreanBuddy but remember that this ticket was 36,000 won ($31.79 USD) more expensive. 

**SUMMARY** (someone check my math, also I'm just googling the won conversions it may have been different the day I purchased)

*Korean Buddy*

*Ticket Price: ~$396.00 USD

*Fees:  ~$107.27 USD

*(shipping to my home: $20 lol just send to your hotel)

TOTAL: $503.27

*Wonderful*

*Ticket Price: ~$428.00 USD

*Fees: ~$73.35

TOTAL: $501.35


From my experience, Wonderful looks a lot cheaper, but worrying about being charged for asking questions was a little annoying. Also if anything went wrong, like if the seller cancelled the ticket and we had to find a new one, my total fees could have shot up. 

Which would I use again? I think for expensive concert tickets I would gamble on Wonderful and hope everything works out to avoid KoreanBuddy's flat fee. If the tickets were cheaper, maybe I would use KoreanBuddy for the more extensive service. Honestly I'm hoping not to have to deal with TicketBay again because it was really stupid expensive. I wish I had a good Korean friend I could ask to pay over 400k won for me and be able to pay them back but I would feel bad. I like using a service so I don't have to worry about my friend having enough money in her account, or making them sign up for PayPal (lol).

I hope this post doesnt get flagged or deleted as just some shallow fan theory or not deep enough of a discussion, but que sera, sera. Im not going to mention theories on why these things might have occured, but you guys definitely can if you want. I will just be stating what definitely happened and some sprinkles of my thoughts here and there. [I'll cite this video as my source].(https://youtu.be/HwNpMzJSzd8)Im pretty sure that if i had simply posted it as a vid its against the rules that way. But i really want to discuss this, so lets do it. 

Now as i have mentioned before, im not a stan/casual fan/regular follower of LOONA so I have still have an outsiders perspective of things still. I did find it a little weird that they were sooooo popular and trendy but the hype died down and they didnt win anything, but at the time i didnt think much of it and chalked it up to their fanbase only being intl fans and there werent enough GP fans to vote for them, etc. Now im not too sure. 

* so as the story goes, BBC hired Kakao M to be the distributor of all their content. Album sales, all that. Everything that can be bought from LOONA. However, despite knowing LOONA sold 50k albums for their previous promotions, Kakao ran out of albums (or just didnt make enough) and then said they would be back on a specific date with more in stock. When that day finally came, they said they were out of stock for limited edition and that theyd be back with more of *those*. Then when THAT day came, they did their thing and said they wouldnt be making any more albums. 


* When the album first dropped it was available on Itunes. But soon after LOONA started topping charts, Kakao M stopped Itunes from selling the album as an album and instead restricted them to making the album be sold in singles (), which in turn made the album in totality way more expensive AND stopping the album from charting as an album. 

* Kakao M uploaded LOONAs album on a totally new spotify account instead of the one they already had with thousands of followers. This might be explainable. 

* When LOONA did their debut showcase and went on M countdown, they were trending on Naver(!!!!!) BUT it was a lost opportunity to get recognized seeing as Mnet didnt upload their videos for 3 whole hours, as potential new fans searched for their performance. They kept uploading other groups and artists videos from that days show. By the time Mnet uploaded the videos, LOONA had stopped trending. 

* Entertainment Tonight tweeted about LOONA but deleted it a little later.

* A fan documented all of the struggles LOONA was having with their sales on wikipedia, only to have that information deleted, over and over. 

* For 18 years, the Seoul Music Awards has had 3 awards possible for the Rookie category. But the year LOONA had a chance to win something, a good chance at that, they had only 2 categories available. 

**UNVERIFIED:**

* Mnet only allowed 12 Orbits inside for the LOONA comeback performance. I can sorta expain this one but it is still kinda weird.

This is all reminding me of early BTS days and i think it would do BBC well to start doing things for themselves, if they can manage to do so. For example when BTS was getting clowned and made fun of on variety shows, Daddy Bang said ""lol so thats how youre gonna roll? K"" and made BTS their OWN show. I dont know everything about their distributors and sales but i at least know a lot of companies(cje and m.)  are probably fuming that they had a comeup independent of the usual. I dont want to write 5 more paragraphs of my own thoughts here though so yea lets discuss",2,0

I hope this post doesnt get flagged or deleted as just some shallow fan theory or not deep enough of a discussion, but que sera, sera. Im using LOONA as an example because theyre who i know the most about. Im not going to mention theories on why these things might have occured, but you guys definitely can if you want.

2498,2019-03-20,2019,3,20,2,b30hjj,What was the comeback that made you realize you were fully into Kpop?,WendellAngelo,1553017722,"I remember distinctly that I started listening to kpop in April of 2013. SNSD's I Got A Boy was the first ever MV that I've watched.

Easy to say my life hasn't been the same since. 

I remember getting hooked on so fast and wanting to know every member, who they were, what they liked, etc. Started watching variety shows from 09' that they were in lol 

But I mostly kept to SNSD and didn't pay much attention to the comebacks of other groups. I listened to other groups  but I didn't know really the impact of a comeback yet, the live performances at the shows and the victories, etc. I didn't understand that at the time. 

So what I consider my first one and that I realized that was no turning back on this world was when SNSD came out with Mr.Mr in early 2014.

 I watched every teaser, saw every image, watched the MV the day that came out and listened to the whole album when it was released. And watched every show they were in performing and promoting that concept. And that to me was when I knew I was forever going to be a part of this crazy world lol 

Every kpop fan has that moment with their favorite group/artist and I want to know what was yours ",131,88

I am simply wondering if people have found kpop to be a positive resource or even a useful resource in their life and how it influences them in their lives.

For example, I work in a school in Spain (like a teaching assistant thing) and the kids like to get rowdy and not pay attention to the teacher. Out of an emergency, I decided to put [Oh My Girls Liar Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNZKqhXCv5c) and make the kids copy what I was doing. It worked! And they even like using the Liar Liar action, because they find it fun.

How about you? How has kpop become useful or a positive outlet in life?",49,69

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/sb4pd/how_much_do_kpop_idols_make/c4cscbq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  from an older question about how much idols make. That post also uses an example of 97,425$ split between four members for the calculations. But if the group has, say, 13 members, that drops their income into single digits. Is this why this fansite tradition started? And also, does any fansite just simply give their idol the cash? ",14,10

I am a 20 year old music producer, who is interested in KPOP production. I've produced music for around 6 years, and for the past few months I've started to shift my style more towards KPOP. I am looking for a community with focus on kpop production and songwriting, where we can give critique and potentially work together, so everyone can become better.
People with all levels of experience are welcome. If you're not a producer/songwriter, but still interested in the process, your feedback as a kpop listener is also welcome, so please feel free to join. 
Hopefully there are other people out there like me, who would like to join this community I've just started.

Basically as the title says-- there's an alignment chart (well, triangle) based off of [a John Mulaney bit in The Comeback Kid](https://youtu.be/PTf3gqDcaM0) where he mentions how, as a child, he and others started chanting ""MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S!"" in the back seat of a car, so his father pulled into the drive-through, ordered one black coffee, and left.

This has been turned into an [alignment triangle](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://media0dk-a.akamaihd.net/23/87/c6054e02fda878a23306a480bd6cdc77.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.dorkly.com/post/85747/the-mcdonalds-alignment-chart-meme-is-taking-over-the-internet&amp;docid=sipPC9eRwrbpBM&amp;tbnid=AENzuPZz7SJpqM:&amp;vet=1&amp;w=1280&amp;h=1271&amp;source=sh/x/im) (i don't know how to imgur, so pardon the google image link) where the given situation is that there are children yelling ""MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S!"" and the three responses are:

* ""MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S!""
* \*pulls into drive-through as children cheer\* \*orders a single black coffee and leaves\*
* ""We have food at home""

It's a bit of a sliding scale, so people can be at any one of the corners of the triangle or they can be a mix of any of the three options.

I'll do Stray Kids:

* Hyunjin, Jisung, Felix, Changbin, sometimes Chan and Jeongin: ""MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S! MCDONALD'S!""
* Seungmin, Minho, sometimes Jeongin: \*pulls into drive-through as children cheer\* \*orders a single black coffee and leaves\*
* Woojin, sometimes Chan: ""We have food at home""

I figure this because they're all pretty playful at heart but Woojin and Chan seem like they'd be comparatively more responsible. Minho and Seungmin seem comparatively more likely to order the coffee. Jeongin sways depending on his mood.

I actually really want to run an ""Idols as John Mulaney quotes"" discussion, but I don't know if it's too silly to be allowed-- I'm actually going to send a modmail later, haha. Otherwise, mods, if you're reading this, would it be okay?

So, who is which McDonald's alignment?

An example **does not** include YG Treasure Box, PRODUCE X101, the new girl group from A Team (VAV's company) or Brand New Music Boys (MXM).

I'm personally looking forward to the debuts of 2 girl groups.

1. RBW's new girl group. Na Goeun was my No.2 pick in PRODUCE48, and I had to check out their trainees via [365 Practice](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCor8nQnEdMs4eBcU-uVBQ8g), and I instantly fell in love with Jieun (PRODUCE 48 contestant), Yuki, Yesol, Eunseong and Soojin! Their vocal game is no joke and [their cover of Valkyrie by ONEUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s_XcXYBJu0) was SUPERBLY DONE. Not to mention, their vocals are very good, as expected from RBW. I'm just waiting for RBW to drop the announcement of them debuting soon and follow them along.
2. Mystic's first ever girl group. (I know that Brown Eyed Girls are in Mystic, but they were formed under NEGA network.) I've watched [A-TEEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwHgjmRoNc4), for a little bit and loved Yeo Boram in the drama, which turned out to be Mystic's trainee, Kim Suhyun! I then checked out Suhyun in Mix9 and her friend Hwang Jimin. I then checked out their [busking videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/welcomeMYSTIC89) that they do once or twice per month and just was in pure awe. Moreover, Lee Soomin, the 2nd place among females in MixNine and former Produce 101 &amp; Kpopstar season 6 contestant, actually joined Mystic and started training there too! I got to know Doyoon from that company who is just sweet. Moreover, TAKEUCHI MIYU IS ACTUALLY A PART OF MYSTIC HOLY HELL. I don't know if they debut as a group or separate solos' but I'll support all of them regardless. But, IF they debuted as a group... I will stan them SO HARD OMG.

So my question is... what group of trainees from what company are you looking forward to their debut?",43,35

It was pulled from Girl's Day's official YouTube page mid-listen yesterday and I need your help.

&amp;#x200B;

Whistling is the I can do considering I don't know Korean and I don't sing well.

[https://youtu.be/bgBa9zIFFvU](https://youtu.be/bgBa9zIFFvU)

&amp;#x200B;

I made a previous post on Girl's Day's page and I can summarize it here:

The song has some ascending numerical lyric chorus.. The song is clearly in Korean but the main chorus has English words spoken in an ascending pattern .. ""1,2...3 to the 4 and...""

""5,6..."" My memory may fail me and maybe they only said 2-3 numbers and not list them out exactly like I did but that is what I remember)..

Assuming quarter note =120bpm 

The ascending line goes like (1,rest, 3,rest, 1, dotted eight +sixteenth, 3, 4) repeat all this x2

After these lyrics of ascending numbers you get a 2x repeat of a descending line ((dotted eight + sixteenth) x4)

I know that is oddly specific but any help would be very much appreciated!",2,1

Hey Everyone!

I'm working on a project for my South Florida Lpop community women's month fan meet next week and I was wondering if I could get a hand from the reddit community in researching this topic? I was pretty disheartened that i could not easily find this kind of information in a compilation of sorts. It's also been a challenge to find sources outside of wiki's for groups or idols i dont follow.

  
For the presentation I am creating a sort of 30 minute retrospect on kpop girl groups/soloist who  have made big strides and accomplishments for women in the industry, their outside businesses, or philanthropy.   
I've got a spread sheet going that I am editing which lists each soloist, and group by generation. It's a bit of an overwhelming task for me at the moment because I have a week to be ready.    


I would greatly appreciate anyone who could lend me a hand by simply posting relevant info in a comment here or pm me to access the spreadsheet document.   


Thanks! ",1,2
2916,2019-03-23,2019,3,23,0,b46lxq,UPDATE: r/kpop Sings 'Fantastic Baby' Cover Cancelled,dunechka,1553269494,"Hi all,

In light of Seungri's crimes and the effect this investigation is having in Korea and internationally, we at r/kpop Sings have decided it's in everyone's best interests to cancel the upcoming cover of Fantastic Baby that we [announced at the beginning of the year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ajrkv7/wow_rkpop_sings_is_covering_fantastic_baby/) 

We're extremely thankful to everyone who submitted vocals and supported the project, and we want to extend a sincere apology to the community and especially the participants for having to make this decision. It's very much not our intent to lump the rest of the Big Bang members in with Seungri, but we think it would be in poor taste to release anything he had a part in creating (no matter how small) with the evidence piling up against him. Even if we completely edited him out of the video, that's still more time looking at his face than I can personally handle, so hopefully you'd at least not wish that on *me*.

We've decided to completely drop the song instead of postponing it due to the gravity of his crimes, but we'll be getting started on the next theme in early April (a nice, friendly theme that is unlikely to blow up in our face). 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


Please look forward to our future covers, and again, we extend our deepest apologies to the participants and community members looking forward to this release.

See yall in early April, and as always, thanks to the community, the mods, and our team for your patience and understanding.

Now I dont really mean this strictly in a look-sense, as that would be too easy to point out. 

Two of the most prominent examples to me: 

- Jaejoong(JYJ) and Taeyong(NCT). [Heres ](https://imgur.com/cfxrYfa) a picture for comparison. It doesnt stop at looks, theyre both multi-talented and could 100% be entirely solo artists. 

- G-Dragon/Jiyong(BIGBANG) and Mino(WINNER). [Pic for comparison ](https://imgur.com/9sR3Tzi). Theyre both the main rapper of their group and they have the same smile ?? and half the time they get the same hair styles.

I'm a hip-hop fanatic so I can appreciate a good rap in kpop when it's a song that fits this specific genre and the person rapping has a nice flow. 

But after awhile it gets pretty tiresome when 90% of the songs has a rap break in it and most of the time... it's not needed to make a great song.

I think the industry may have got to caught up in that aspect and I just wish there was a more natural and organic relationship with hip-hop.

Use it when it will add to the song, not because it's required.

What are some of other kpop tropes you think you can leave it behind you? ",284,206

My name is Terra and I'm a grade 12 student at the Bishop Strachan School in Toronto. Im a Chinese Canadian immersed in the world of Kpop. I am currently enrolled in the Advanced Placement research course, where over the course of the school year, students tackle their own research questions through first-hand research methods, ending with a paper and oral presentation for the AP college board.

I have chosen to explore how the popularization of Kpop in Western culture in the 21st century promotes (or not) the embracement of ones own race and culture for Eastern Asians living in Canada. Kpop has really helped me find and accept my identity as an Eastern Asian and I want to know if this was the same for you! My study group is Eastern Asian Canadians.

The purpose of this project is to understand the relationship and connection between the involvement of Kpop and ones perception of their own Eastern Asian heritage. This survey is totally voluntary. The data collected will be used to fill the research gap in my research. Specific quotes or trends observed from what you say may be used, though you will remain anonymous.

Thank you so much for your time!

I would like if they really showed off what each album/era had to offer, by releasing more than one title track and also performing the song on stages as well. Just to keep comebacks exciting. I feel like the most exciting part of a comeback is the MV release and maybe the first week of performance, then its just repetitive seeing them perform (and also get slowly tired) over the next 4 weeks so I would change that.

I also think it would be a good way to get non-fans to hear the B-sided that fans always swear by, and its true, often the title track isnt the best song on the album and releasing other tracks and promoting them before moving onto the next comeback can actually be a way to gain new fans. Itll also take out the factory style feel that k-pop can often have.

(Bonus thing I would change: I would get rid of the roles like visuals, dancer, etc, the company can have it in mind what roles they want for each member, but I think having it so explicit who does what is pretty off to me and I cant explain why, but I dont like it!)

So whats your one thing you would change about k-pop if you had the power to do so :)

He was in a few korean viral videos, but this is his first MV that really showcases his talents. He is also known as Byung Un of Balming Tiger, but I feel personally that the hip hop genre of music doesnt do him justice sometimes. Anyway, hope you can check him out and say hello before he leaves for the military!! Thank you!

This is more of a rough draft of a Red Velvet final concert setlist, but Id want it to be something like this:

1) Happiness (debut !!!)
2) Ice Cream Cake
3) Bad Dracula
4) Russian Roulette
5) Blue Lemonade
6) Power Up
7) Red Flavor
8) Rookie
9) Dumb Dumb
10) Cool World
11) You Better Know
(then the stage gets dark and the girls come out wearing all dark outfits and makeup and everything)
12) Bad Boy
13) Kingdom Come
14) So Good
15) RBB
16) Look
17) Automatic
18) Peek-A-Boo
19) I Just
20) Body Talk

I would want the concert to be like half-Red, half-Velvet, with a mix of their biggest title tracks and fan-favorite b-sides. The only thing is, idk where Id put or if Id even include the ballads

So what would ur final setlist be, and what is the reasoning behind it?",60,77

I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. Good luck!

I was just randomly thinking today about why I like to listen to K-pop so much, and I realized its because of two reasons:

1) I feel like watching idols interact with each other and having fun with each other somehow allows me to kind of forget about the fact that I have negative 2 friends in real life. I feel like I can trick myself into thinking that I'm a part of a friend group when I look up those videos and pretend to make memories that I have never actually had in my entire life. Its kinda sad, but it sometimes is a nice way to kind of make memories for myself that I would otherwise never have in real life.

2) The music is just fun! I have been listening to so much sad western music that hearing songs like Roly Poly by T-ARA or Bang! by After School just makes me feel so happy walking to class. Since I understand Korean, its sometimes a nice change of pace to be able to listen to something that is just different from everything else around me if that makes any sense. 

Anyways, mods can take this down if its not an appropriate place to put this. I just was not feeling good today and just realized that I found myself finding a lot of k-pop related stuff to keep myself occupied in my free time and to not make me feel sad and alone. ",7,9

All I can remember is the music video. It is a video where a man was looking for his daughter throughout the city. He ended finding his daughter in a back room of a gambling parlor. When he found his daughter, his duaghter was dead. So, he carried his duaghter back to a hotel room and clean her and put her in a luggage. After that, he had went to sea and say his final goodbyes and release to the luggage to the sea with his duaghter in it. And the music video ended with him sitting in the sand as she watches the luagge float away.

The singer was a female singer.

I hope someone know this music video. Thank you!",7,0

He went into the prostitution business and was close friends with people who did worse things. At that its too late to return to normal, people know of your business before it was public so its not like he can quit because he accepted money from investors. He aligned himself with the wrong people and didn't become a leader of his own business, thats the real error. Prostitution is fine, the whole drugging and raping isn't. Seungri could only tell JJY to stop once because he can't tell on him either, because it would backlash at him. 

I've been a VIP since their Debut, I still support the 5 of them. There's a difference between someone who couldn't get things together and feels regretful vs someone who is a d\*\*\*head, and it's sad to me that several people are judging seungri like he's a d\*\*\*head. 

Picture Seungri as your long term friend, You'd want to know his side, not just base on what media and everyone thinks. You'd be disappointed in him sure, but to abandon him because he did something wrong? what kind of friend/fans are you? We as VIP, and human beings should be about bettering someone, all everyone is doing is saying the obvious about things he's done, over and over again.

I just want to see all of your opinions on this topic.**

I saw a tweet on twitter which had me thinking, Why do people look down on singers that do not participate in their own music? This isnt a topic limited solely to kpop, but I think its more common in kpop to have idols that arent directly involved in their music.

While Im pretty sure all of them have *slight* inputs in the song producing, many idols are uncredited in the producing/writing aspect of their songs. We dont necessarily know all of the reasons why most idols arent able to produce their own songs, but its normal for idols to perform songs that they didnt produce themselves. But is it wrong for them to be held in high regard as other singers that do produce?

Im really curious on what you all think about this. Should they be looked down upon and seen as beneath other idols? Please comment, I want to see what you all think about this.

Pop groups are still achieving success in the UK and have had a steady presence in their music scene since the 90s, the UK is clearly receptive to that kind of music and performance I think in a bigger way than the US market is. There are plenty of groups that only achieved success in the UK but were still extremely successful, your average Brit in their twenties or thirties now could probably name you a surprisingly long list of native pop groups, and that continued from the 90s through the 2000s and 2010s in a golden era similar to the Hallyu Wave even when pop groups had overwhelmingly faded from the American scene and definitely long stopped dominated there.

UK pop groups also resemble the kpop model a lot more. Many of those acts that made up the Hallyu Wave and 2000s UK pop could have easily been put into the same show lineup without giving you whiplash. Now the charts are dominated by other genres, and groups are either broken up or dormant, there's a hole that could be filled by the correctly marketed kpop group with the correct sound.

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**GeeGu Comeback Support Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_geegu_01/)

* Date Project Ends: March 25, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is GeeGu?

GeeGu, formerly Gate9, is a six member girl group from Star Entertainment.

As Gate9, the then nine member group debuted  with the mini album *Gate 1: Paperwhite* in October 2017 under NOS Entertainment. Their debut song ""[Chemical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuWCvrIBr3w)"" was the title track off the album.

From looking into things, it looks like they didn't have a comeback since, making this project their first comeback since debut. Besides the rebrand, three members ended up leaving (Yun, Vivian, Kady) prior to this, so GeeGu is now promoting as a six-member group.

Not too much is known about the members, but kind of a cool fact is Haeyeon actually was in Ye-A with IZ\*ONE's Kwon Eunbi (Kazoo), under the name Pier.

Who is ASTIN?

ASTIN is seven member boy group signed to KINGTOP Entertainment.

Honestly? I haven't been able to find much of anything about this group in English. So if anyone knows more about that, please feel free to contribute!

From what I could find, it seems that the group has done [a lot](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=astin+kpop) of K-Pop pre-debut busking/promos though.

[**NC.A Special Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_nca_03/)

* Date Project Ends: April 10, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is NC.A?

NC.A (which stands for **N**ew **C**reative **A**rtist) is a soloist signed to J Planet Entertainment. She debuted in August 2013 with the song ""[My Student Teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpLG8oiWpR8)"", which notably starred Girl's Day's Hyeri in the lead role in the MV.

She also has dabbled in acting as well, most notably having a minor role in *Reply 1994.*

She is most popularly known for appearing on the KBS survival show *The Unit*. She placed 3rd in the final episode and became a member of the female project group Uni.T. The group promoted from May to October 2018, with their final single being the Brave Bros produced ""[I Mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bY64rtP0wk)"".

This Makestar project is for her first comeback since the disbandment of Uni.T.  She has also run a [successful](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_nca/updates/o/1#tab) Makestar in the past, having raised 190.8% over the initial goal.

[**HOT PLACE NEW Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hotplace_01/)

* Date Project Ends: April 18, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Hot Place?

Hot Place (formerly BADKIZ) is a four member girl group signed to Zoo Entertainment. As BADKIZ, the group debuted with five members in March 2014 with ""[Ear Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH85ejAtB0E)"". Since then, the group has had a revolving door of member changes, with 15 former members as of 2019. Funnily enough, no one from the original lineup is in the group anymore (as the final original member Monika left the group in 2018), so a name change kind of makes sense.

In any case, the group's most recent comeback (and last under the name BADKIZ) was in 2018 with the song ""[Just One Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVmrBQJi-18)"". This project is for the group's first comeback as Hot Place.

As BADKIZ, the group has previously run two successful Makestar projects, earning [126.9%](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_badkiz?locale=en) and [115.9%](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_badkiz2?locale=en), respectively.

Who is DONGKIZ?

DONGKIZ is a five member boy group signed to Dongyo Entertainment. 

While the group has not officially debuted, they released a pre-debut single in November 2018 titled ""[NOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM033D-A7fc)"". The group was initially slated to debut in February 2019, but that got pushed back. This project is for their debut album.

There's not anything really notable about the group outside of the standard idol stats, but they did most notably feature in a [CF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzlnYclsg3w) with Chungha for LG in February 2019 and were the only pre-debut group to perform at the most recent HEC KOREA Thailand concert.

* Date Project Ends: April 30, 2019

Who is Girl Crush?

Girl Crush is a four member girl group signed to DAMent. Originally a hip-hop dance team (promoting under the same name), the group has decided to try their hand at being an actual girl group. Based on the last upload from their [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Aj9B9scmM5r9PNaNjy2jw), the group started promoting as a dance team in March 2018.

Due to their name being what it is, I wasn't able to find too much else about them in English, though if anyone knows anything else about them, please let me know!

If you'd like to see more of their dance stuff, check out their YouTube channel that I linked above!

Who is 1THE9?

1THE9 is a nine member male project group formed by MBC survival show *Under Nineteen.* The show was pretty well followed on the sub, so I won't get too much into the group, but the group is slated to promote for a year, with this project being for their debut album.

Though the group has not officially debuted, the group performed on music shows in February to promote their pre-debut single ""[Like A Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI2BYoIVvg)"".

If you'd like to read more about the group, please feel free to check out their [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1the9)!

3133,2019-03-25,2019,3,25,8,b53dnw,What was the moment you fell in love with your ult group/bias?,sleepydvamain,1553471488,"In light of all the stuff thats been happening the last couple weeks, its been stressful for us k-pop fans. I could really use a pick me up, and thought some people would too, so i thought it would be a good idea to share some good memories instead of sad ones.

So, tell me: What was the moment you fell in love with your ult groups/biases? Was it a moment that they showed real and raw emotion and you felt connected to them from then on? Was it a stunning preformance that made you fall in love? Or something different? 

For me:

- My first UB was G-Dragon. I remember listening to BB in my bedroom one night and I felt this overwhelming wave of calm come over me. Something about Jiyongs voice lulled me oh so softly and I remember feeling so connected to him ever since. He had always been my bias, but that was the moment I knew. Ive ulted him since 2013, and havent looked back since. 

- Leeteuk was more recent for me, at the beginning of this year. I was getting into super junior this summer, and i really struggled with picking a bias as i love all of the members so much individually, but i remember a few months ago i was watching videos of them and hearing leeteuk talk about his struggles as a leader and in general made me wanna protect him so bad. That was when I decided that he was another one of my ults.

- Seokjin was another recent one for me. I had fallen out with kpop after 2014 and when i came back, the first re-introduced i got was Dope by BTS. I remember watching the video and screenshotting Jins part and sending it to my friend, immediately asking what his name was and to know more about him. I remember that night after marathoning their music videos, falling back into love with k-pop, and seeing his sweet and goofy personality I fell so in love with him. Also his angelic voice really solidified it for me.

Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

I'm at a bit of a loss and I'm going alone with limited Japanese skills, so want to try read up about it as much as I can beforehand. 

I just got my seat allocation and it looks a bit far away, I've read somewhere that people bring binoculars to the concert, is that recommended?

Mine: I can't get into BTS no matter how hard I try.  I like Suga a lot and Spring day is superior song,but everything about them as a group feels so safe and calculated. I can't blame the boys thb and only wish them success. 

It's tiring and boring that there is no competition when it comes to Awards ceremonies. It's basically the battle between same groups every year.

I've never liked BIGBANG or any big YG artist (except Daesung ,he is the best ) they are always

Last night something someone said to me regarding these things triggered an anxiety attack, the worst one yet, so I was in my room in the dark looking at my career plan, just feeling the anxiety atack coming, feeling how I was just about to break down and cry desperately. 

But then I got this super random text from my cousin, with a screenshot from Twice's What is Love video, and he was saying how thanks to me he end up watching these things and with a couple of comments about it, so I end up replying to him, also talking about the video, the talent, the editing etc. I also sent him Itzy's Dalla Dalla live performance, which he really enjoyed too, and the next thing I know I'm just in my room, talking about this little thing that I just really enjoy, like nothing happened, calm and with the video on the background.

It may not be much, but today I feel really grateful for getting into kpop, it really helped me last night, and it makes me appreciate more the artists and the industry a little more.",2,33

The best example for me (because I recently started stanning them) is Eunwoo from Astro. Whenever people talk about him, no one is talking about how nice of a person he is or how soothing he is. The first thing people normally talk to him about, is his handsome face. And honestly, it annoys me because, he's also human, he's also a talented vocal, and he is incredibly nice, so why does everyone only talk about how handsome he is?

I've seen this with a few male and female kpop idols but this is the only one I can clearly remember.

And what idol would you like see in a Drama?,WendellAngelo,1553631602,"It's almost a given that an Idol will venture into acting and do a Drama at a point in their career. That's something I think it's very underrated about kpop, the way that they can collide these two worlds.

On that topic, which Idol has impressed you the most in a drama? 

For me there's 3 that are at the top:

1 D.O. in ""It's Okay, That's Love"" what a powerful performance with so much nuance and energy at the same time

2 Eunji in ""Reply 1997"" how can you not love Shiwon? It's impossible lol 

3 Hyeri in ""Reply 1988"" what can I say? Her talent jumped off the screen for me and it's one of the best characters I've ever seen in a drama. 

And the follow-up question: what Idol that hasn't done a drama yet that you want to see/think would do well? 

For me is Hobi himself lol I don't know why, I think he would be great in a romantic comedy. Or maybe because he's my bias and I want to see more of him and I think a role like that would fit him very well. 

Give me your picks

3460,2019-03-27,2019,3,27,17,b61qky,Top non big-3 girl groups?,wisely1300,1553674056,"We all know how much of an advantage debuting under a Big-3 afford. So I was just wondering what people think are the top non big-3 girl groups of all time, based on musical sales, popularity (both the whole group and member-wise), peak/length of peak, music quality, CFs, other ventures, etc. Here are mine (with reasonings why):

1. Sistar: the Queens of Summer need no explanations. Their physical sales might be lacking, but at their peak, they arguably rival SSND and 2NE1 for the title of the most popular kpop girl group, pumping out hits after hits such as: ""I Like That"", ""Alone"", ""Touch My Body"", etc.  Individually, they're each carving their own paths in solo music (hyorin) and/or acting (Bora, Dasom), and are all v popular (w the possible exception of Dasom). Probably the banner-bearer for the sexy concept for girl groups.
2. APINK: the longevity alone (8+ years and still promoting and pumping out music) in such a ephemeral and cutthroat industry elevates their status. At their peak, circa mid 2013-2015, they were on fire, going from ""No No No"" to ""Mr. Chu"" to ""LUV"", and probably placing either the bottom of the top-tier girl groups or in the top of the next tier. Individually, Eunji has found great success as both a solo artist and an actress (Reply 1997 anyone?), while Na-eun and Bo-mi also dabbled in acting and doing variety. 
3. Girl's Day: Everyday Girl's Day! Famously took them forever to find their footings, but once ""Expectations"" gain them more widespread recognition, they took off on brilliant streak, following up with ""Female President"" (which net them their first win), ""Something"", and ""Darling"". At this peak, 2013-end of 2015 or so, they were mostly placed in either the bottom of the top-tier girl groups or at the top of the next tier. Individually, they probably have the most success of anyone here, with Hyeri (Reply 1988 is arguably one of the most iconic kdrama of all time) landing lead roles after lead roles, Minah (Beautiful Gong-Shim averages double digit ratings for its run) making her inprints in acting, and Yura MC-ing shows after shows. 
4. T-ARA/GFriend: 
   1. T-ARA: Before their 2012 bullying scandal that massively took down their popularity, T-ARA was a rocket on a trajectory for historical status. Rising in popularity with ""Bo Peep Bo Peep"" and  ""Neo Ttaemune Michyeo"", they broke to the top with the iconic ""Roly Poly"". For the next year and a half to mid-2012 when the controversy broke, T-ARA was undisputably among the top girl groups. Sadly, they have not come even close to the same level of success since. 
   2. GFriend: (I don't follow third-gen as closely so please correct me here if I'm wrong on anything): GFriend experienced a meteoric rise to the top in 2015-2016 with ""Me Gustas Tu"" and ""Rough"", becoming the new darlings of the kpop world. ""Navillera"" continued that success trend, albeit on a smaller scale. Since then, they have not had the same amount of success as they had earlier in their career.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Before anyone comes for my head, I didn't put in KARA because I don't considered them to be non big-3. From what I know, when they debuted, DSP was still one of the big-3 companies before YG overtook them when Big Bang exploded. Feel free to correct me.

How come she hasn't released anything since Seoulite? All of her singles were big hits which is impressive given that she tends to have a R&amp;B/Jazz sound yet she hasn't released much since then, aside from the Japanese album. Her label is making a huge mistake. 

Hyolyn has struggled since Sistar disbanded. She has released a few singles which got some publicity over the racy music videos but the songs don't do that well. She's one of SK's best singers and I'd love to see her come out with a huge hit. 

Ailee is stuck in K-drama ballads. What happened to that new LP she was about to release last year? ",84,95

3558,2019-03-28,2019,3,28,8,b6bp9s,When Idols Call Each Other Out on Broadcast...,seraphcentered,1553730638,"By now, Im sure weve all seen the OMG, G-Dragon was a fortune teller and a prophet video compilations on here or our YT recommendations post-Burning Molka. Clickbait, sure, but in such a manufactured and controlled pop landscape, its amazing that BBs warnings to Senguri were not just passing jokes mashed into out of context videos nowThey were sincere, authentic expressions of concern... on Radio Star.

I think we can all ageee that these variety shows and appearances are super scripted, so knowing that GD knew how public and polished things were and STILL slipped in a call out made me wonder...

And I remembered that it wasnt the first time that Ive seen something like this play out so purposely in public, that later turned out to be super serious and not an off handed remark for entertainment at all.

During SHINee promotions, especially for 1 of 1, Minho called out Onew for drinking excessively all the time. Minho isnt the most graceful speaker to begin with, but Keys role on Drinking Solo made these pointed comments all the more awkward and obvious. They were pitiful, unflattering anecdotes that the other members tried to laugh off, and Minho was relentless in bringing it up (on Blue Night, on stages and special VLive broadcasts, etc...)

Exhibit A: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hmH4u14Jo9w

Obviously, public scandal later validated Minhos concerns, and then some.

Q: Have your idols done these on broadcast, way-too-real for fake entertainment call-outs before? Have you been suspicious thats whats happening based on everyone elses reaction but watched the comment get lost in the upbeat mood of the show?

And then... Why? We all know were not supposed to know our idols real life and authentic selves. We all know how much control agencies have over their idols images, even on something as private as social media. So why are idols using programs like Weekly Idol or Knowing Brother to instigate these conversations? Since so much is kept private, on purpose, these public call-outs feel purposeful, too. But why? Is this allowed? Or is it something idols have to sneak into their answers and get away with? Is the intent to use viewer reactions as a shaming tool? Idk! I cant remember a non-reality star from the West whos ever done anything like this. I get it everywhere else, but as a K-Pop fam... its confusing.",10,48

They have been announcing the members every few weeks, and when Sehoon was announced, his past wrong-doings were posted on twitter, which included things like sexual harassment, bullying, etc.

  
Fans of C9boyz are protesting to kick him out of the group before debut, but he has not been confirmed to be kicked out yet.

If you search #  on twitter, it will provide more information about him.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your opinions? He should be kicked out? Or should he be given a chance?

Yesterday while walking home at night I was listening to music. The path I passed through was residential so not many people were out and I felt okay enough to sing out loud (at that point I was unironically listening to HSM2 Bet On It). 

Then as I pass by this guy and lady, the lady pushes him and walks away and honestly he's probably a really nice guy in real life but I'm suddenly on guard. Taemin's press your number starts playing and I started to belt out bits of it and walk really fast to leave the area quickly. I was loud (not too loud but yeah, louder than normal), that was sort of Out of Character for me and I guess I was a bit adrenaline filled (_and_ paranoid because I looked back and duh the guy wasn't following me or anything)

With groups, I find it a bit difficult to choose only because they are all truly products of their environment.

Over 100 idols were evaluated and the top 64 were seeded into a tournament bracket. Stars from groups which have been disbanded for a long time were not considered (so no 2ne1, After School, AoA, Kara, or Sistar members). I'm using AnimeBracket to do the whole tournament - it's super easy to use and all you need is a Reddit account.

&amp;#x200B;

Its time for r/kpop to decide once and for all, who is our ultimate bias?!

&amp;#x200B;

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your \*\*favorite\*\* idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  whether you like their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

&amp;#x200B;

# [Vote Here!!](https://animebracket.com/vote/-r-kpop-ultimate-bias-tournament/)

&amp;#x200B;

# [Full Bracket Here!!](https://animebracket.com/results/-r-kpop-ultimate-bias-tournament?group=1)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For inevitable questions about seeding, I ran into some difficulties with AnimeBracket since it assumes there's going to be an elimination phase and seeds after that. Basically, I seeded the stars into different ""pools"" and then the site randomly seeds them within those pools. The top eight stars are split into pairs, so Tzuyu and Irene will be the top seeds in either group, Lisa and Taeyeon will be the #2 seeds etc From seed 9 onward the stars are split into groups of 4, meaning that a #9 seed could be seeded anywhere between #9-12, but no lower or higher. As for questions about the actual rankings which determine seeding, I tried to balance between stars popularity, overall appeal, and my own personal judgement to give a fairly neutral bracket which will still have the potential for upsets. The seeding heavily favors girls from popular groups in the ranking and tries to stay consistent with stars popularity within their group. Regardless of seeding, what matters is how the users of r/kpop vote! So if you dont like my rankings, please voice your displeasure in the comments and try to persuade others to vote your ultimate bias to the finals!

&amp;#x200B;

Have fun voting!

&amp;#x200B;

# Voting for Round 1 of Group B begins in 24 hours, at 7:00 PM EST!

This will be a 'competition' between various girl group B-sides, with only one winner and with multiple rounds of voting, so you'll be more motivated to vote for your faves.

For this round, you will be able to vote for YOUR top 12 girl group B-sides of all time. Co-ed groups are included as well, so keep that in mind. Any song from any era is allowed, as long as you follow the rules.

This round will be open for three days, and each user is allowed to vote TWO times for their Top 12. After the three days end, each song that has gotten at least one vote will be entered in another poll, and from then on the songs will start to be eliminated, in small (or big, depending on the number of songs) groups. So, go vote now, if you want your favorite B-side (old or new, underrated or popular) to have a chance at being the winner.

If you try to vote for more than 12 songs / batch, your vote will be completely nullified. Remember, you can only vote for 12 songs / 2 times (during the three day period), not for 24 songs at once.

&amp;#x200B;

Go on, vote, have fun, and have a nice day!

**Preliminary / First Round Overview**

I didnt even realise, but there have been plenty of songs voted for this first round. The total amount of songs voted per group is as follows:

\- Red Velvet: 38 songs

\- Twice: 25 songs

\- Loona: 19 songs

\- Girls Generation (SNSD): 18 songs

\- GFriend: 17 songs

\- Mamamoo: 15 songs

\- CLC: 14 songs

\- Dreamcatcher &amp; Oh My Girl: 13 songs each

\- APink &amp; f(x): 12 songs each

\- (G)I-DLE: 9 songs

\- WJSN, Wonder Girls &amp; fromis\_9: 7 songs each

\- EXID: 6 songs

\- GWSN, Pristin, Sistar &amp; IZ\*ONE: 5 songs each

\- AOA, Lovelyz &amp; 4Minute: 4 songs each

\- Blackpink, Orange Caramel, Triple H, 2NE1 &amp; Secret: 3 songs each

\- Weki Meki, IOI, Nine Muses, KARD, Miss A, T-ARA: 2 songs each

\- Everglow, Girls Day, Berry Good, Kara, Momoland, GD, TOP &amp; BOM, 4Ten, Fiestar, Brown Eyed Girls, BOL4, DIA, After School, Trouble Maker, Bob Girls: 1 song each

The most voted song has been Red Velvets Kingdom Come, with 19 votes, while Loonas Stylish (10 votes) and (G)I-DLEs $$$ (10 votes) came in second place. The third place was shared between Red Velvets I Just and Sassy Me (each got 9 votes). Thank you for your voting and I really am sorry for cutting it short, however, picking between more than the already big number of 305 songs would be a struggle for both me and you. 

Now, the first official voting round commences. In this round, youll have to vote for your top 30 favorite songs out of the entire bulk of 305 songs. You can vote 3 times in total, and for this round, given the large amount of songs, there will be plenty of eliminated songs. Whichever song doesn't reach at least five cumulative votes will be eliminated. So, if the song reaches four points, it might stay, but if it's anything below five votes, it'll get eliminated. So, choose wisely, because your vote truly matters. I might do a soloist / boy group version for this once this first war (with only Girl Group B-Sides) ends up with about 100 songs left, but, until then, this is my priority.

Remember, you have to vote 30 songs, and you can ONLY vote thrice. Youll have to vote your favorite songs, so they can get more points and not be eliminated. (1 Vote = 1 Point.)

Now go on, vote, but make sure you choose wisely! Unless any disturbances appear, this round should be over in three days. Im not quite settled on the exact hour, but you will NOT be able to vote any later than the date specified.

P.S.: Please dont hate on me if you dont like the songs picked, these were all the valid votes of the community, I did not influence them in any way.

You can find the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJOQBRIX4RvWJHyuXOXRDdaOg3tcbCCbBukUgQ_CpXK7EzGA/viewform), if there are any issues with it, please let me know.

You should find a playlist with all of the songs in this round attached here, soon enough. Once I finish making the playlist, I will add it onto the post, so you can listen to any of the songs that you havent listened to yet.

Have a nice day and make sure to vote for your favorites!",40,32

all I remember from the video was that at the beginning there were several girls standing around (or sitting next to) one girl. I think they were looking at her phone and then someone says something like ""Namjarul manda baya hae"" (Something like ""You have to meet this man""). This is iirc before the actual song starts.

&amp;#x200B;

**ATTENTION: I'm moving the bracket post to noon U.S EST, that way most users will wake up to the last round's results and new brackets voting, rather than splitting on voting on 2 sides of 1 day. This means voting for this round will only span 17 hours.**

&amp;#x200B;

# RULES

\* In each matchup, vote for your favorite idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.

\* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!

\* Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also \[[kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com)\]([kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com)) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

# [Full Bracket Here!!](https://animebracket.com/results/-r-kpop-ultimate-bias-tournament/)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

An additional note on seeding since many people were asking: popularity (both for the group and individual member) was heavily weighted in ranking since it is the most objective measure, there was also a bias towards relatively newer groups (debuts in last 5 years). However there were a couple discrepancies between the rankings and some groups' popularity polls. The egregious examples are EXID's Jeongwha being in the bracket but not Hani, and 4 Izone members making the bracket but not Minju. That is an error in my judgement/research but unfortunately it can't be changed.

The [animebracket.com](https://animebracket.com) site does allow for an elimination phase where users vote on who should make the tournament and seeding will be based on how many votes members received in the elimination round. The main benefit of this would've been that seeding would've been more fair since it would've been determined by multiple users rather than just myself. The reason I did not do this was because 

A. I didn't know how much interest there would be for the tournament and felt the elimination round would be clunky and bloated and not really build excitement.

B. If idols are seeded directly by users voting, and matches are determined by users voting, it makes the first rounds fairly redundant as the userbase has already determined the more popular idols in seeding.

All in all, I think it would have been better to have done public seeding, but I don't believe it would change many of the picks in the bracket. I hope people can still enjoy the bracket even if some of their favorites didn't make it. Also as was in the last post, I could only control seeding generally, so I did not choose any of the matchups.

&amp;#x200B;

Have fun voting!

If so, why?",kween_of_Pettys,1553900748,"I read someones reply in a thread the other day that it made them upset that idols accept gifts from fans. I thought about it a little more and i dont remember where i saw it now, but i wondered why that person felt that way. Is it the fact that the gifts are high value or something? If theres anyone that shares that viewpoint then please share why you feel that way. Personally i dont see why its morally wrong for idols to accept gifts from fans.....i mean seriously after years of training and bs everyday with my label (including: being broke for years) id be snatching those gucci bags with gratitude haha. I never thought about how accepting expensive gifts was wrong except maybe its excessive and against minimalism or something....


I know BTS stopped accepting gifts. Im not sure about the exact reason why but i think it was partly culture and they felt.like thwy were taking from their fans or their fans were being excessive, that type of thing. If anyone could explain that too itd be great.


I at least know that in Korean culture since gift giving is part of their culture its somewhat frowned upon to give a lavish gift since the person reciprocating would feel pressured to give something of equal value and its a type of shameless flex in a way.

3906,2019-03-30,2019,3,30,21,b7akeu,The case against KARD not being diverse enough,HistoriaWong,1553947785,"This seems to be the general consensus among fans and average listeners alike, at least from what I've seen online. I've always looked at it as Hola Hola, their first album, being like a road map, a good sampling of the two sides of KARD, with songs like Don't Recall being representative of their more serious songs and songs like, well, Hola Hola itself being representative of their lighter side. The more serious side was then explored in-depth with You &amp; I, their second album, while Ride on the Wind did the same with their lighter side. And now that that's all over with, we get the more experimental Bomb Bomb, with J.Seph and BM being given the main vocal duties for a change among other things. 

Part of what I'm saying is that it's not all the same. It seems like there was a conscious effort put in to make KARD diverse. And while it is true that a lot of their choreography involves body rolls and hiding a member behind another member before revealing them (like a deck of cards, no?), and they use simple, catchy hooks, those are all just signatures to me. I'd prefer to stan a group that has their own niche sound cornered and easily identifiable like that. They're still diverse, though. You &amp; Me goes so heavy and personal in a way that's distinct from everything else, for example. BM makes a declaration in Trust Me like the one in Living Good, but not at all about the same thing. And while Moonlight starts off similar to Living Good, it just elevates to a peaceful, dreamlike ambience that isn't present on that first album because that's the sound of Ride on the Wind as a whole.

And yes, I do think the song quality for all of their songs is great too, and doesn't let the diversity down at all. ",1,2

First up, I'm sorry for the misunderstandings and confusions I've caused with the timing of the rounds, I've been dumb and impatient and have, sadly, rendered some people unable to submit their top 12 B-Sides due to the short amount of time when submissions were allowed. This is going to be a inconvenience, probably, but I swear the upcoming rounds will be more pleasant and just better in general.

&amp;#x200B;

To try and rectify my mistakes, I'm going to open a so-called part two of the Top 12 submissions. You will be able to submit your top 12 favorite girl group B-sides, of ALL time, twice. So, overall, you will be able to nominate 24 total songs, 12 at once ONLY. The submission period will last TWO DAYS, so hopefully people will have more time to nominate. 

The ongoing Round One of TBSW (The B-Side Wars) will also end in TWO DAYS, so make sure to vote on that as well if you haven't yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The planned timeline is:

\- Round One ends in TWO DAYS

\- The Apology Round also ends in TWO DAYS

\- When the results for The Apology Round are all gathered, there will be a new post with the so-called other half of Round One, for the songs newly nominated. The system will follow that of Round One; whichever song doesn't reach 25 cumulative points (votes), will be eliminated. 

The rest of the Rounds will be discussed later, however, to try and completely clarify this Apology Round, this is dedicated to everyone who hasn't been able to submit their initial Top 12 Favorite B-Sides.

&amp;#x200B;

You can find the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOTbBx-6YVnVFaG5QAjvKQmWf7C5-eJ4IBWewSQ2JmUGX0ig/viewform) and remember, you can ONLY vote twice, 12 songs at a time. The voting will last TWO DAYS.

&amp;#x200B;

Have fun voting!

# RULES

* In each matchup, vote for your **favorite** idol. This means whatever you want it to mean  their looks, their voice, their dancing ability, their personality, how much you enjoy watching them perform- all of these and more can help you decide.
* Dont worry about the criteria you use for voting. This tournament, at heart, is a popularity contest, vote for whatever idol you like the most for whatever reason!
*  Convince other users to vote for the idols you want to win, or even to vote against the idols you want to hate. Sick of Blinks and are a huge Red Velvet stan? Write an essay about why Irene winning over the blink plague is Gods will. Go nuts, preferably with as much salt as possible.

Oh, and you don't have to vote in every matchup if you don't want to. Consider abstaining if you can't decide between two stars, or if you don't know one of them well enough to make an educated decision. Also [kprofiles.com](https://kprofiles.com) is a great resource to acquaint yourself with stars you're unfamiliar with!

I dont understand that out of all the remaining members of GG, she is the only one who seems in the dark. And it seems SM has no plansin promoting her as a singer. I would love to hear her voice more because she sounds so good during OT5 comeback.

Another one is **D.O**. For me, kyungsoo's voice defines EXO music and it is outrageous from SM that he only has 4 songs which last song was release in 2014. Man, it seems like SM is wasting his singing talents. I also heard rumors that SM has been cockblocking his singing opportunities. I hope that sooner/later we will heard news about him getting a solo album or at the very least a one fucking song because he deserve it as one of the main vocalist.",54,31

And many groups have claimed they have the best dancers in the group. But among all the new girl group, who do you think are the top 3 dancers for this generation?

&amp;#x200B;

here are the categories that i think a god tier dancer should have:

\- Dance moves fluidity - dance moves doesn't feel like it danced part by part. And does the moves so sweet like         

wavees.

\- Concept chameleon - whether a cute, sexy, powerful, chic. She can immediately grasp the concept given to them.

\- has a good control - when she is a group, she doesn't really stand out much as her own. but rather be a compliment  

for the group. 

&amp;#x200B;

so here are **my** top 3 dancers for the 3rd and 4th Gen(with no particular order)

&amp;#x200B;

Iz\*one Lee Chaeyeon

Kim Chungha 

OMG'S Yooa

&amp;#x200B;

the reason that i chose these girls is because they always give me that ""Ohhh!"" factor when they are dancing. 

&amp;#x200B;

my runnerups:

BP- Lisa

RV- Seulgi

Twice- Momo

&amp;#x200B;

Just to be clear you cannot add the 1st and 2nd gen kpop legends such as snsd, boa, girls day, kara etc. the 3rd gen starts at 2013 and up debuts. 

&amp;#x200B;

so who are your top picks for the dancers? 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that very few Kpop vocalists/songs are able to portray what feels like genuine, singing-from-the-heart emotions that cause you to feel moved when you hear them. I think that they often also convey a feeling of being very cinematic and larger than life. 

Ive noticed that for me, the songs that I recognise as fitting into this category the most are those that either feel exceedingly raw, sad and almost broken, and those that feel full of youth, freedom, and hope (and sometimes, perhaps even both at the same time?)

My Choices (there are a lot - Ive been collecting a bit of a list so that people can receive exactly the feeling I mean):

* Love Bomb by Fromis-9
* Ugly by 2NE1
* Way To Go by SNSD
* Time Lapse by Taeyeon
* Make Me Love You by Taeyeon
* SIMPLE by Seventeen (Woozi)
* Healing by Seventeen
* The Truth Untold by BTS (ft. Steve Aoki)
* Crooked by G Dragon
* Be The Light by Block B
* Whats Happening? By B1A4
* A Lie by B1A4
* Letting Go by Day6
