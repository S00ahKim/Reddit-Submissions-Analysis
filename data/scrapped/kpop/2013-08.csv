It seems we are not exactly representative of what the overall kpop world thinks, feels, and loves. This has much to do with our demographics being mostly male from North America and Europe. Also, the fact Reddit is structured in a unique fashion compared to other forums and blog sites, it generally attracts certain types of people. 

What are the things you have noticed to be different?

Are there other reasons why? 

Is it a good or bad thing we are different?

Is this topic even worth discussing?",91,47

193,2013-8-7,2013,8,7,5,1ju3um,Weekly 8090 Artist - Kim Gunmo,[deleted],1375821667,"Hey all!  

After getting permission from the mods, I am starting a new weekly series of Korean artists from the '80s and '90s. Over the years, I have met a handful of both old and new K-Pop lovers who have been enthusiastic about discovering and learning about older general Korean music and about hearing music that everyday Koreans know and enjoy.    

Hopefully, at least another handful of the K-Poppers in the reddit community will also find these spotlights enjoyable.  

I've decided to start off with an artist with whom many of you may already know, a singer who still remains relevant today, a true icon of the '90s K-Pop scene -- Kim Gunmo.  

Musically diverse and vocally talented, the prolific hit-maker Kim released his debut album in 1992. The hit song [""First Love,""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8GSXBHLa5w) one of his most famous tracks and a prime example of his style and color, is still well-known today. Another representative song from the album is [""Raining On A Sleepless Night.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9CIPoQCy34)  

In 1993, Kim made a hit out of [""Excuse""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-1KIqs3qJg); then came his dance-disco mega-hit [""Wrongful Meeting""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDKBuynxXfM) in 1995, which spawned a fad of memorizing the fast rap at the beginning of the song among young Koreans. The track also solidified Kim as one of the most beloved singers in Korean music.  

Some of his best songs are his ballads, including 1995's [""Beautiful Goodbye,""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oBfZAgBZJA) 1996's [""Lingering Feeling,""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBX6fHyXbec) and 2001's [""I'm Sorry.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdtxDyVx74)  

In 1997, another dance song, [""Love Is Leaving,""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Xoj9Ff31g) swept the charts. In 2001, Kim dropped [""Woman In Rain,""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugx9tBeVU-8) another hit reminiscent of ""Wrongful Meeting.""  

He continues to make music; here is the jazzy [""Moon of Seoul""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hG_I8USKIc) from his 2005 album Be Like..., one of my favorite songs of all time.   

I hope you guys enjoyed this first 8090 artist! I'll be back next week with more. ^^",10,29

I just don't understand the appeal. I mean, their songs are mildly catchy but so are most K-pop songs. The group as a whole can't sing (as far as I can hear), can't dance (their choreography seem to be popular though) and their rapping is beyond cringeworthy. The group isn't even good looking (and those helmets in Bar Bar Bar made the group look a little stupid)!

I've watched all their MVs and they're quite forgettable. So, you know, could a Crayon Pop fan explain how and why they've become reasonably popular? Someone a while ago said that they remind him of early Kara or other groups that are popular but don't otherwise have a lot going for them. That they have the underdog factor. I'm not buying it. 

Maybe you can change my mind?",26,0

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Started 4 years ago ""areia remix"" is a k-pop remix/remake brand that with the help of our 27,000 fans became the most popular of its kind. After 120+ releases ""areia remix"" now includes a workforce of almost every Youtube k-pop remixer under the production guidance of Jun Areia. Moreover the brand caught the attention of several entertainment companies giving us the chance to boost the brand with official remixes like last year's ""Love Is Energy"" and ""Hypnotize"". With many more official remixes in the works and income coming in ""areia remix"", what was some Youtuber's fan-work was transformed into an actual paid job for a whole team. Except ""areia remix"" the production team has worked on original k-pop songs such as Andamiro's Waiting.

That incredible fan response and external investment from people that believed in what we are doing, gave us the courage and opportunity to attempt something that a few years ago would be a silly dream: since last May areiacreations is officially a label/entertainment company and we are preparing to debut our first two artists in early 2014! Unlike most traditional business models it's the fan support that made any of these possible so we would love to engage with you, answer your questions, chat about your thoughts and listen to your suggestions!

This may be a little too much information, but I'm turning eighteen very soon and I've been putting in a LOT of thought about getting a tattoo of one of Tablo's quotes/lyrics as my first tattoo. So I need a help with a few things:  
  
1) What are some of your favorite or popular, deep quotes/lyrics by Tablo?  
  
2) Should I get my tattoo in hangul? Or in English? (I'm definitely leaning towards hangul, but would still love some opinions!)  
  
  
  
  
I love Tablo. He truly has a deep, beautiful mind that I can't help but fall in love with. What really made me drawn to him was his album Fever's End. Most of the songs were so dark, calming, heartbreaking yet beautiful all at the same time. You can clearly tell while making the album he was hurting. And let's be honest, we all hurt. Maybe not all the same kind of hurt, but most of us definitely know what it's like to be in the dark. And I've been in the dark for more than couple years. But I'm slowly coming to terms that I may not be as alone as I think. Tablo helped me see that. My all-time favorites from Tablo have to be **ALL** of Fever's End (Part 1).  
  
But if I had to choose a top four they would be:

I'm a college student in the midwest of America (in the state of Iowa) and I'm pretty into Kpop. 
I thoroughly enjoy the songs, but what I really want to do is learn the dances or at least talk to someone about kpop.
None of my friends really like it, my school doesn't have any clubs related to it, and my school is very ""country.""
My question is, how did you make your friends who also like kpop?
Do you have any advice for someone who would want to learn the dances but doesn't have any resources to do so?
Any sort of advice would be super helpful, thank you!

Her signature high-toned, powerful voice solidified her as a leading singer alongside other female solo singers such as Nami, Kim Wansun and Lee Sunhee. She picked up numerous top awards during her '80s peak.  

Jung's hit songs include both ballads and pop; her most-loved song is perhaps the upbeat and addictive ""Joy,"" which swept the charts in 1988.

(more discussion [here](http://onehallyu.com/index.php?/topic/17946-so-sm-and-mnet-are-fighting-again/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1kev1w/m_countdown_performances_130815/cbo7x9c))

[People are speculating](http://koreanelite.tumblr.com/post/58375517549/sm-vs-mnet-beef) that since it seems SM is upset with Mnet, this could impact EXO, f(x), and Henry's performance at KCON, who's concert is hosting M!Countdown.

This fear was intensified recently, when the [official KCON store was opened](http://shop.kconusa.com/index.php/all-apparel/official-2013-kcon-usa-event-t-shirt-pink.html) and the [**concert shirt didn't list EXO and f\(x\) on the back**](http://i.imgur.com/y6bV4QI.png) as performers. (Henry probably wouldn't have been on it anyways because he's listed as a Special Guest and not an artist) A couple comments on the [KCON facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kconusa?hc_location=stream) from fans say that leaving them off was just a mistake and kcon plans to fix it soon, but I have been unable to find an official source stating that. ^(It seems hard to believe that they would just forget to include the names of 2 of their most anticipated performers.) People also said that the reason they aren't on the shirts is because SM is bringing their own merchandise, but yet again, no official word.

Both [EXO and f\(x\)'s schedule's still show that they're attending the concert](http://krispy-byuns.tumblr.com/post/58381489590/about-the-rumors-of-exo-f-x-and-henry-might-not-going), but with how little notice they gave before dropping the M!Countdown performance, things could still change.

Tomorrow is KCON's last livechat before the concert so people are hoping everything can be cleared up then.

I'm honestly hoping that SM realizes how big this concert is for international fans and can work through their disagreement in a civil manner that won't disrupt the con. (However as a Cassie and seeing as this is SM, I don't have high hopes.) I'm honestly terrified of what will happen if they don't go. With the amount of people that are going just for those two groups, this could be devastating.

I will try to update this post as new information comes out.

**Edit 5:45 PST: Hoon just said via the live chat that the reason that SM artists aren't on the shirt is because SM doesn't allow 3rd party merchandise. He says it's no cause for worry.**

Edit 2: This was just shared on the FB Page
&gt;
&gt;    Shirt does not have full line up because of licensing policy. EXO and f(x), apart of SM, is an example of why they are not on the shirt. Please do not fret!!

The 1985 album, titled ""Deulgukhwa,"" remains one of the most important records in the history of Korean music. In 2007, Kyunghyang newspaper and a group of industry professionals [ranked the album No. 1](http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?mode=view&amp;artid=200708231025551&amp;code=900313) in a list of the 100 Greatest Korean Albums.  

Deulgukhwa's first album, lauded as ""the beginning of the renaissance of Korean music in the mid-to-late '80s,"" carries these beloved hits:  

* [March](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByFPlUo2q84)  
* [Only That Is My World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aomt_cCNXO0)  
* [Every Day With You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11BxN-yaPT0)  

(If you have the time, give the entire album a listen. It's well worth the while.)  

In 1986, the band released its sophomore album ""Deulgukhwa 2,"" which, though not as explosive as its first attempt, left behind a timeless cry of a song, still popularly covered by many artists today:  

* [Please](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbSIdHFjjWE)  

In 1988, the band's vocalist, Jeon Inkwon, released ""Jeon Inkwon."" Despite it being a solo record, it is closely tied to Deulgukhwa and its music; the album, a huge hit, was voted No. 95 on the aforementioned list. The song ""After Love"" is a remake of Al Stewart's ""The Palace of Versailles"" and remains one of Jeon's representative pieces.

I love Jayesslee's cover and was wondering if there were any other KPop songs that sound like it in terms of style. A kinda chill, ""simple"" sounding song. Minimal instruments. Duets/great harmonies definite plus.  

I'm not sure if this style would fall under the KPop genre... but any help would be appreciated.

Her favorite idol is Super Junior's Eunhyuk and right now, I would really like to help her out by seeing if Eunhyuk can leave a personal message for her. Due to this sickness, I believe this is her 3rd or 4th time being in the hospital. She went to go get it check last weekend (not this past weekend) and ended up staying at the hospital after that. They told her it'll only be a weekend treatment but this time, the doctors have been telling her it's going to get better only to say they need to do more test. First it was Monday she would go home, then they pushed it to Thursday, then the following Monday (this past monday) and then another test on Thursday, and now she just got news that it'll take a little longer and she can't go home yet. The hospital is 1hr away from her home and her family and friends rarely get the chance to come visit her so she's been feeling really down because she can't go home yet. She feels like a burden and hates that her parents has to go through this. I really don't want her to shed anymore tears and it pains me to hear that she hasn't left the hospital yet. So what i'm asking from you guys is, is there a way to ask Eunhyuk-sunbaenim to give my friend Maria some hope and wish her to get better?  I was thinking something along the lines of Vine or something like that. It'd really make her day and give her hope and cheer her up so she wouldn't feel so down laying in the hospital bed. One of her messages just now was, ""im just worried what will happen in future..if ill be able to travel and so on.."" I was thinking of twitter but I'm pretty sure he gets plenty of messages and mine would get passed up. Well, that's pretty much it. Thanks for taking the time to read.

tl;dr

Friend is diagnosed with [Sclerosis Multiplex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis) and is still in the hospital getting treated with no date of when she'll be ok and released. Would really appreciate it if there was a way to contact her favorite idol SuJu's Eunhyuk to get him to wish her a personal message for her to get better so she can not feel so down being sick and have more of a fighting spirit to get through this part of her life.",11,11

&gt;    An important message from 4NIA JAPAN to all club members

&gt;Thank you for always encouraging 4Minute. This is sudden, but we have an important announcement for the club members.
The contract between 4Minute and Universal Music Ltd, UM360 division's Japanese management will soon end. With the contract end, the official fan club ""4NIA JAPAN"" will also close at the end of August. We apologize deeply for both the sudden announcement, as well as for inconveniencing all of the club members who had supported us since the fan club was created.
4Minute plans to continue to be active in Japan, so please continue your unwavering support for them.
In addition, the fan club site will continue to be open to the public until the last day of September. We will also stop accepting inquiries at that time.
It was a short time, but thank you for all of your support.

But for me it has to be [Lipstick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-d8EYwmdWA) by Orange Caramel. It's so cute and fun, you can tell that a lot of heart and soul went into making that MV. There's even an understandable story arc to it. I like to imagine if Wes Anderson ever traveled to Korea and directed a Kpop music video, this would be it. I've been watching it a lot recently and prompted me to do this post. What's your favorite MV?

EDIT: WOW! Awesome videos, you guys! So many feels. I just wanted to say, I wasn't trying to be pretentious with this post. I just wanted to see if there were any videos out there that got lost in the shuffle of things but that still conveys a great story or visual evokes a felling. I appreciate these videos as much as I do any video with just highly choreographed dancing in them.",42,32

845,2013-8-28,2013,8,28,2,1l7991,The general public's perception K-Pop.,Bleac,1377626052,"Lately I have been paying attention to the comments below K-Pop related articles on websites that are not targeted at K-Pop fans. I've been left with the impression that a lot of people hate K-Pop and I think part of it is because they didn't even bother to get more interested into it.

Like this article - http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/17/girls-generation-psy-gangnam-k-pop.

Some of the comments are:

""No thanks.
If you think the state of mainstream music in the UK is bad, wait until you see how manufactured K Pop and J Pop are""

""Please stop reporting on K-Pop. It is entirely manufactured nonsense. Yes the girls are pretty, but music is for listening. Other than a stupid novelty record Korea has nothing to offer the world in music (yes i know its popular through out Asia)""

""Guardian, stop it. Please just stop it. This lot make Steps sound like Tom Waits. There is no reason to import this shallow, plastic, soulless shite. There is already more than enough to go round now.""

It leaves me with really bad feeling that general western audiences don't even bother to understand K-Pop. For me, K-Pop is something fresh and unique compared to western pop music. 

My question is what do your friends who don't listen to K-Pop think of it? Why do they not like it? What kind of music do they like? 

Check this comment ""The saddest part is that they are exactly the same kind of bad pop music we already have over here.""

Really? I would like to know about this bad pop music ""we"" have ""here"", because I can't compare anything western to artists/bands like 4Minute, SNSD, IU and G-Dragon for example.

Why do you think people hate K-Pop? I hope I've expressed myself well enough to start a discussion.",84,52

852,2013-8-28,2013,8,28,7,1l7vxq,Weekly 80/90 Artist - Lee Sunhee,[deleted],1377642074,"Lee Sunhee was just 20 years old when she burst onto the Korean music scene with her perennial hit ""To J"" in 1984 by winning the grand prize at one of the nation's top music festivals. Tiny in stature but possessing a powerful, ringing voice, Lee took the rest of that year by storm. ""To J"" spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the charts, and she swept the awards.  

* [To J](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpCaz7zjKk)  

In 1985, Lee released her first album, ""Ah! The Past,"" which would go on to top the charts once more. It would not be an exaggeration to state that Lee was at the top of the game as the singular most standout singer of the late '80s. Her records became consecutive hits, one after the other, leaving behind immortal songs. Selections from her first album:  

* [Ah! The Past](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSPSv9xn71k)  
* [Conflict](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nm5FEc2rrY)  
* [Prayer of a Girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8hP0nnqFUI)  

Later that year, her sophomore album, ""West Wind,"" became another No. 1 hit.  

* [West Wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRLcfC4AWDg)  
* [It's All Right](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpr5xRYp8_0)  
* [Tears of Lovers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHplNJyZsX8)  

Her third album ""I Want To Know"" came out in 1986.  

* [I Want To Know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7E-m8G_n68)  
* [Naught](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqoFWKsnKIU)  

Lee released her fourth album, ""This Place Where Love Falls,"" in 1988. Again, it spent five weeks at the No. 1 spot and brought her numerous awards. Standout sonsg in particular are ""Beautiful Mountains and Rivers,"" which was a remake of a song by Shin Joonghyun, the Korean father of rock, and ""I Always You,"" which has become one of Lee's most loved songs to date.  

* [Beautiful Mountains and Rivers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIUDziHW1zA)  
* [I Always You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K87L83gcX7I)  
* [This Place Where Love Falls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwjawdf-2mI)  

The following year, Lee released her fifth album, ""With A Short Laugh.""  

* [My Street](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb9u0eTWd_4)  
* [With A Short Laugh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0B_ASXHt_Y)  

Her successful career continued into the '90s and still does in the '00s, but her most memorable hits remain those from her earliest years. Lee has released 14 albums to date and is still considered one of Korea's top vocalists.

In one scene the singer (the girl) is sewing while the guy is tied up. IIRC both were wearing  black clothes. Not a slow song at all. Saw it on Channel V probably in 2011. Maybe the song's name was Going crazy but it's not the one by Song Ji Eun.

Can the people of this sub help?",0,1
