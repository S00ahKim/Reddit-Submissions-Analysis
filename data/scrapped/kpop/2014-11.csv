If my girlfriend didn't hold me back, I'd probably be in jail for self protection or trying to protect my girlfriend.

Will answer any questions.

---

Answer 1

&gt;My girlfriend were waiting for kyungsoo's Cart premier conference and we were doing nothing wrong. We were just standing there by the line barrier waiting and these fuckin bitches have the nerve to grab us and yank us back so they could get better photos.

&gt;And they're all yelling at us in korean and saying ""we are fansite we have the right to take more picture than you"" and they almost made my friend drop her camera so I told them to fuck off and I said if they touch me again I will literally knock them the fuck out.....except their English sucks so they just stared and tried to reply .

&gt;And literally I shit you not, every damn ""fansite master"" almost got all of us in trouble cause they weren't the ones listening to security. And even then SECURITY had the damn nerve to actually grab my arm and push my head....I was about to knock a bitch out.

&gt;And then when he started to pull my girlfriend back, he had his hand on her chest instead of somewhere else.

---

Typing everything out here:

It was not worth it.....and in the end the damn girls wouldn't listen so they canceled the even for Kyungsoo's safety....and when people started leaving THATS when KYUNGSOO walked out and waved and then all hell broke loose

The security is retarded....they attack the ones who aren't doing anything but totally ignore the ones trying to jump the barricade.

Both my friend and I have scratches from the girl *and the security guard* everywhere.  Also, the fans kept swinging their cameras around and we have hella bruises everywhere. 

**All of this was just for Kyungsoo. Imagine if it were for the whole group**

---

My friend and I were also some of the youngest. We were pushed around by a bunch of 30 - 40 year olds too. We're 17 and 18 so we aren't even considered adults yet.

Picture of the place three hours before: https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t34.0-12/10485845_10204907377105415_6444346185379864272_n.jpg?oh=bc26d0eff0782f803fd7ec8a27defe1c&amp;oe=5459B853&amp;__gda__=1415162940_c41c899fa6d988f24a532a67cf192eda

We were in the 4th row but because there weren't tickets, its not like it mattered anywhere.

---

Literally was about to break their fucking cameras and shit if they didn't stop clawing and pushing/pulling us around. I didn't want to do what they were doing since I know the people are biased against foreigners and I really don't want to end up in jail as an exchange student for violence &gt;.&gt; Anyone know what's legal to do in this situation?",10,0

It's a relatively short survey with only a couple of dozen questions. Feel free to skip any questions that you can't answer. I'm fully aware that this isn't the best survey... so.. yeah.

Consent Form
My research consists of finding out the reasons to why the Korean culture is able to globalize itself. I will be trying to answer this question by giving out my self-made surveys to various people around the Internet who are aware of this globalization. By participating in my survey on Korean globalization, you are fully aware that whatever you may answer will be used as statistics and data for research. These statistics and data will then be used to come to a conclusion as to why the Korean culture is able to globalize so successfully and if people are accepting this foreign culture being integrated into their own as well. All of your answers will be kept confidential. If you have any questions about my research, feel free to send me an email at david.tran.pl@hotmail.com.

280,2014-11-8,2014,11,8,1,2llcfx,Is Luhan even relevant to KPOP anymore? [x-over post from /r/rkpopslumberparty,[deleted],1415379133,"So, I'm just wondering, is it even appropriate for me to post things relevant to Luhan here and over in /r/kpopslumberparty anymore? He's no longer apart of EXO and I sort of highly doubt he'll be making Korean music anymore, so I'm questioning whether he can even be relevantly posted about in these subreddits. 

And if he's *not* something people want to see in this subreddit, can you point me to one where people would be more receptive to it? I was wondering about /r/cpop but they've got a rule to not post anything that's too idol-centric; it seems to be a purely music sharing space and Luhan's currently not even doing that.

I just don't want to bother anyone with these posts if they're irrelevant or don't make sense to make in these places. I've created /r/xiaolu recently for those that do want to talk about Luhan, but as it's brand new there are very few people in there and I'm currently the only poster. Any feedback would be appreciated.",4,0

I figured I'd do test run to gauge best times/actual will participate interest in a simulcast event.

So, without further ado:

Check out https://hallyunoona.com/kpopslumberparty/ for my first (and hopefully not last) music video and chat 'slumber party'.

(I know it starts during the day for America but I was trying to pick a good start time to please as many people as possible, we can always move the time in future occasions if people enjoy it)

I picked SM artists this week as a pretty much random theme but I can throw together pretty much any theme you guys would like for future events.

If this dies a death I promise to drop it and let it die, but I (like some others here) think being able to chat Kpop with some people would be quite fun.

NB translated it!

This [Pann post](http://pann.nate.com/talk/324751631) has been trending in the top 10 all day, accumalated 231,080 views with more than 1000 comments. The views and comments are really large for a trending article on Pann, it will grow further in numbers.

Post talks about B.I's father being charged for embezzlement of 4.2 billion won (equivalent to 10.7% of the company's capital) and is summoned to court for a trail. The journalist who added B.I's name in the article published during 28th Oct has taken the article down but cache exists. No info provided by how this was discovered.

In short, victims of the embezzlement aren't ok with B.I debuting because hey, guilty by association (rme), lots of netizens think B.I's fashionable goods come from his dad's embezzlement money (wtf, they're sponsored) + telling YG stans to stop shielding him since the victims have a harder time than a trainee who lives fashioanbly and has a big company to provide for him etc. Some are comparing this to Han Hyo Joo's scandal where her brother was involved in beating up killing a soldier (?).

So yeah, this may or may not affect IKON's debut or B.I's promo for the time being.

Don't expect YG to address this issue, despite it blowing up.

---

Edit : [NB translated it](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/bis-father-caught-embezzling-24-billion.html)

Pann: BI's father embezzled 2.4 billion won from his company

1. [+346, -20] It's not Kim Hanbin that I feel sorry for but all of the victims involved.

2. [+275, -9] Knowing how hard BI worked for his dream, it's upsetting to hear this... but  from the perspective of the victims, I'd cry too if I had to watch the son of someone who ruined my life doing fine on TV like that;;

3. [+224, -10] (Paste of a blog post of BI's neighbor who wrote about how his father paid for all of the expenses for their vacation to Macau including a yacht trip)

4. [+169, -11] As expected, look at the YG fans shielding this already. I do feel bad that he's getting hate just for the association but YG fans have no right to demand that these articles be taken down when Han Hyo Joo is getting just as much hate for her association with her dongseng. 

5. [+157, -91] If you have any brains at all, you wouldn't feel bad for BI. You feel bad for him because he trained for 5 years? It's not like he focused entirely and only on music. Who do you think paid for all of the expensive snapbacks, clothes, and shoes that he wore? That all came from the money his father embezzled out of innocent people, you idiots. Over 300 are victims in this scandal, it'll be a miracle if nobody commits suicide at the end of all this. Over 18.1 billion won has been lost in this scandal... money that was used by BI's family to take their neighbors out on vacation with. Be honest with yourselves. You're not feeling sorry for him, you're scared that you won't be able to see BI anymore on TV. 

6. [+151, -15] I can't believe people are sympathetic with BI. You really think you can shield that?  Don't hate on him just because it's his parent's fault and not his? With that logic, you should go and defend the descendants of war criminals too. 

7. [+129, -14] As if BI isn't involved with this... who do you think paid for all of the luxury stuff he buys? Think of the victims, not your fangirling.

8. [+122, -3] I can't believe fans are shielding Hanbin saying he didn't do anything... Sure, he didn't do anything directly involved with the case but why do you think Han Hyo Joo gets hate? Why do you think descendants of war criminals get hate? 

9. [+111, -64] I don't give a crap about iKON or Kim Hanbin but that Kim Sung Joo guy is utter trash. He merged a company that was doing just fine on its own and sucked out all of its funds... You think he only embezzled 2.4 billion? There's probably money that hasn't even been accounted for and probably distributed amongst others involved with him. He's rich, though, so he'll probably get a few years in jail at most while his son becomes a top star... what a bargain deal for him.

10. [+109, -0] If I was a victim, I'd never want to see that man's son out on TV singing and dancing while my own family's living on the streets... BI, you have too many enemies now. Find strength. 

11. [+109, -3] No point in defending BI. Embezzling is a huge crime and there are so many bictims involved. If you're a real fan, just shut up and stay quiet instead of going around saying BI has no involvement with it.

-

Source: Naver

1. [+98, -2] If BI's father has any consideration for his son at all, he better pay the price of his crime... BI's got his debut soon too, what does he expect him to do now

2. [+45, -1] Wow, if you search BI's father, all results are banned and every comment left about it has disappeared...

3. [+8, -0] Wow, poor BI all because of his father... I feel so bad for him and the victims..

For the folks who have no idea what this is, Jombly is a streaming radio webapp for K-Pop! It is free, has no ads, unlimited skips, and updates its song list daily with the top songs from Korean music charts. [Check it out!](http://www.jombly.com/)

I received a ton of great feedback from everyone, so first of all - THANK YOU! I'm glad this is a useful tool for many of you. I never thought this would become as large as it has, so bear with me while I try to get through bug fixes and feature requests!

So that I'm not spamming /r/kpop with updates and such, please forward all future  feedback, requests, etc. to me at /r/jombly.

**Tonight's update includes the following:**

*If anything isn't working, clear your browser cache and cookies for Jombly!*

1. Volume control (iOS prevents this from working, but physical buttons work fine)
2. Bug fixes for song history tracker (sometimes songs would play repeatedly, when they shouldn't have)
3. Huge update to metadata error finder. There will always be some problems that slip through, but this should fix quite a few of the more flagrant errors.
4. There is now a button to show the current top song list, your recently played history, and the songs you have thumbs-downed.

EDIT: 4:00pm PST 11/10/14

**Update just pushed out that should fix any stuttering/pausing of playback!**

Remove any cached data or cookies for Jombly for the changes to take effect. If there are any more problems, please let me know [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jombly/comments/2luhzw/bug_songs_stop_playing/)

Thanks guys, you're all the best! :D",16,61

It's terrible and scary to recall those days. We were lovers and she always asked me to have sex with her. And she wanted to take photographs too. If I turned her down, she got angry, saying ""Don't you love me?"" She sexually harassed me. She said ""Don't you want it? Yours looks so pretty. Let me fuck you.""

She filmed me with a hidden camera when we were having sex. And she spread that throughout my company. All the people saw my body underneath my clothes, and I was treated like a hooker. I quit the company and couldn't even left my home for a fairly long time.

She was involved in school violence and has been cruel to animals. She enjoyed raw sexual remarks about Kpop stars such as VIXX's N, Leo, and Hongbin, Girls' Generation, IU, iKON's B.I and Bobby, f(x)'s Sulli, EXO's D.O and Baekhyun, Infinite, and 4minute's Hyuna.

Actually, she is not a lesbian. She just pretends to be. When she was dating two girls at the same time, she was dating her boyfriend too.

I talked to her agency about all of these stories. But, the agency just ignored me. Since 2 years ago, I've written posts about the matter on the Internet sites. However, the posts are started to be deleted by somebody. The agency knows everything about her.

The harmony between soulful vocalist Lee Hi and pure musician Suhyun along with the added power of rapper Bobby garnered much love and support from the general public. The sub-unit has a lot of potential and their hard work has not gone unnoticed as YG hinted at their **future plans for HI SUHYUN.**
  
YG Entertainment revealed that they did not really expect that the sub-unit would receive so much love and garner such a positive result. They said, ""It is exceeding all of our expectations. **If the response of HI SUHYUN continues to be positive, we are thinking of promoting them on a continual basis.""**

There have been many Kpop singers who were called ""prince of ballad"" or ""king of ballad"", such as Shin Seung Hoon, Cho Sung Mo, and Sung Si Kyung. Through his first solo album Kyuhyun proved that he has more than enough talent as a ballad singer to succeed his competent senior ballad singers. I can say it's a rediscovery of Kyuhyun.

Actually, there are three requirements for ""price of ballad"". Those are singing ability, expressiveness, and characteristic voice tone. Ballad singers, who usually stand still and sing lyrical songs on stage, have to appeal to the public mind only with their singing ability and expressiveness. However, there are not a few Korean singer who meet these two requirements. Among them, those who have characteristic and attractive voice tone can achieve recognition as a ""prince of ballad"", just like Shin Seung Hoon, Cho Sung Mo, Sung Si Kyung, and Kyuhyun.

The title track is 'At Gwanghwamun'.(Actually, the song was originally composed for Super Junior-K.R.Y's new album)

Gwanghwamun is the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul, while the gate has gone through multiple periods of destruction and disrepair as a landmark and symbol of Seoul's long history as the capital city during the Joseon Dynasty. Anyway, the gate is a popular place where lovers come on dates in Korea, and the song is about parting and memories.

The song is a typical ballad music, but it's not prosaic at all. With his sweet voice and competent singing skill, Kyuhyun expresses lyrical mood of the song well. His vocal performance is very impressive because he maintains optimum level of his emotions throughout the song.

677,2014-11-16,2014,11,16,14,2mfyzx,SM USA MONTHLY AUDITION EXPERIENCE/Q&amp;A,[deleted],1416114495,"!

So today, I attended the SM Monthly Audition in LA, USA!!!

And I will now share my experience with you guys :D

My memory is SUPER CLEAR so you guys can trust everything I say below :)



So first, I got to the building like at 1:54 p.m. (on the 3rd floor) and the door opens at 2:00 p.m. so I waited for 6 minutes and there was already 4 people waiting outside. Then the lady, who will be the judge in the audition room, came and open the door for us. On the counter will be a stack of registration papers. You just take one and a pen and fill in all the info, when you are done you just give it to the lady (remember to sign at the signature blank xD) and she'll tell you to wait until she calls you. I was the first one the turned the paper in (shame on me -_-) so after about 15 minutes she called me in with 4 other people as the first group. And the TV playing SM music was too loud -_- so I couldn't warm up (quietly) properly :(. By when I was called in there was already 20 people in the waiting room! My group was me, two other girls who is older than me -_- and two tall - really tall dudes. The lady lead us inside the waiting room, it looks like a practice room -- mirrors on three walls and posters in the back wall. We lined up along the blue tape against the posters wall. The camera was those small rectangular ones - which I find interesting xD, it is set up on the table the lady sits. Firstly, the lady will call your name and give you a sticker number and then might ask several questions to some certain people to clear up what might be vague in the form. Next, she will ask if anyone had attend an SM audition before. She will then explain how the audition will works:

1. Introduce Yourself - You say your NAME, AGE, and then YOUR STICKER NUMBER. Next will be your SCHOOL and GRADE (If Not In College Yet) and state your TALENT (sing/dance/rap)

2. Show Your Talent - If you are singing or rapping then you will recite the chorus or highlight of a song (there will be a rare chance of you being ask to sing a different song) If you are dancing then it will be free-styling to a random song played (you will be instructed how to not cross a certain boundary so the camera can get a hold of you ^^)

Something was different this time. In other experience blogs I read about said that you will have to stand in front of a seperate tape near to the camera. This time we just stay where we are and the lady will just position the camera towards you. I was first in line (the order goes from left to right) so I went first. I introduced myself after the lady gave a cue (a really weird cue lol) and sing a song (you can stop whenever you want-but don't sing the whole song lol). After I finished the lady fixed the camera to the next person in line and gave him a cue and so on. After everyone finished we did the rhythm test to Britney Spears's ""3"". We were instructed to clap to the beat or just freestyle (staying in one spot because there isn't even space xD). Luckily, I knew the song so well (A Britney Spears Hardcore Fan) so I knew the beat and how it goes and clap proudly ^^. So if you know the song, in the beginning there will be claps at the beat -- very easy anyone can do this. The guy next to me start freestyle clapping and did unnecessary but impressive claps to the beat. Everyone else including me just clapped to the simple beat :) After that the lady explained to us how it will take 2 months for a response if you pass the audition (and how they even text you now xD) and if you didn't get any response you are welcome to come back and audition again. She also told us about an incident that happened at KCON -- that there was a man, white and Caucasian, his name is &gt;&lt; I can't remember well but it is like Bernie or something and he is DISGUISING AS AN SM SCOUTING PERSON AT KCON - And unfortunately was kidnapping girls...They have reported him but haven't caught him yet :3 Yeah...So just something to warn ya

SO IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK ME FOR THE UPDATED AND TRUE INFO :D

If by chance you are learning Korean, here's how to do it with K-pop your favorite genre!
I'm from the site K-pop to K-talk, and I'd like to introduce our new web series that will help you learn Korean using commonly used words found in K-pop songs.

Check out our first video and learn what  means using fun K-pop songs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itVGINw6KL0
You'll find songs from BTS, Got7, EXO, and more! 

Our main goal is for you to learn. We would LOVE your feedback for any points where we weren't clear enough or weird explanations. We want to learn how to make this better for you! So remember to check it out and have a sweet day~!
(( Every other week, we will release a new commonly used word within K-pop, along with some examples of the different usages from other popular K-pop songs! ))
Happy Studying!",8,19

Hello! I have a class project where I will be teaching my classmates for 50 minutes, so I want to talk about KPOP and some of the issues in it (I LOVE KPOP, but every genre has it's flaws) , with a focus on misappropriation of African-Americans (but I will sneak in stuff with other races as well).

I will use this in a presentation but it will be anonymous with your username NOT being told so feel free to voice your opinions! I MIGHT respond to some but I will not try to argue or cause trouble!

Do you think that KPOP takes a lot of its ideas from African-American culture and/or African-American unfortunate stereotypes?


Do you think that African-Americans should complain when something related to KPOP offends them?

Do you think that African-Americans shouldnt complain because KPOP is not for them?

Should African-Americans be allowed to become KPOP talent?

Should ANY race be allowed to become KPOP talent that is not Korean/Asian?

Do you fear that KPOP is going to no longer be mainly Korean if it becomes more open to foreign musicians?

What do you think of African-American KPOP fans in terms of attitude?
 
Do you think that when a KPOP star does something that offends African-Americans (or really, any race), they do not know they are being offensive or is it that they dont care?

Why do people get mad when KPOP stars want to date? I mean , we want KPOP stars to make love songs but not try to find love? It sounds unfair to me.

I have noticed this with countless KPOP stars and it's just wrong. I feel like people would not be angry if they accepted the fact that a KPOP star can love their fans, but that does not mean they will be romantic with one. Even if they date/marry a fan, it's just that ONE fan.

Plus, I think we can admit that even though we will enjoy KPOP for a very long time (and maybe FOREVER :D  ) , we won't always be super obsessed with attractive bands. Eventually when we decide to date, we will be more focused on our significant others than a KPOP star. So why should they have to stay lonely forever while we move on?

Also, why is everyone upset that Jin from BTS had condoms? Even though I think that people should wait awhile before doing the deed, he is YEARS past legal age, he has a job (in case he accidentally gets a girl pregnant) and I think he feels like the time is right. I don't think that they came from a fan (although a fan most likely gave them condoms at different times). I think it was HIS own condoms.

The show was FANTASTIC!!!

Did anyone else enjoy the show? Pics? Video?
There was definitely a crowd at the bottom of the stage. Anyone get some good shots from there? Would love to see them!

Can't believe they weren't selling any merch either! One lucky girl got a tour shirt, right off the back of one of the band members! (see album for my potato shots of this)

A++ show! (Extra + for taking off their shirts a few times! ;P)

This is an compacted version of some of the questions I asked. The questions are :

Is appropriation of black people In KPOP A Problem? 

Is there even ANY appropriation of black people in KPOP in your opinion? 

And now, it's time for the fun, fun disclaimers!  :

1) In my presentation,. you will be quoted anonymously.

2) This is a semi-informal disclaimer. I am worried that a lot of redditors who frequent this section think I am ""Anti-KPOP"", that I hate their favorite groups or I am trying to cause trouble. But that is not the case :

I LOVE KPOP. I enjoy many KPOP star's music such as Exo, Got7, BTS, Lee Michelle , Crayon POP , Tiny-G ,etc... I even have super small , semi-crazy KPOP dreams. But just because you love something does not mean you should never mention it's flaws.

You can love a KPOP star's work and/or think they are the hottest thing since the sun, but still let them know politely if they are being offensive and if they continue to be offensive, call them out on it. Trust me, a KPOP star would rather have rational fans than ill rational fans who think they are GODS when they are regular human beings. ",32,0

921,2014-11-21,2014,11,21,12,2my5gd,Pandagram apologizes for Pritz's armband controversy + reveals they will not be making any modifications,gr1zzlybear,1416540324,"Back on November 18, entertainment agency Pandagram confessed that the company was in a state of confusion regarding Pritz's armband issue. On November 20, Pandagram apologized for the controversy, in which their girl group Pritz's armbands were likened to that of the Nazi armband, but revealed that they will not be making changes.

Pandagram representatives explained through an official statement, ""We used the armband to express Pritz's ambition and strong willpower. The meaning of the 'X' symbol and the arrows is that they are branching out in every direction in terms of communication and unity.""

Pandagram apologized for the miscommunication, saying, ""We apologize that it conjured the image of the Hakenkreuz symbol for many people. However, there is no reason for us to support the Nazi Party with the Nazi symbol. We, too, dislike them.""

However, they continued to state that they would not be modifying the Pritz logo and the armbands; ""We believe that modifying [the armband] would seem as if we're saying that we did this for noisemarketing [when that was not our intention], and we believe that [to modify the armband] would mean to break off our willpower and ambition.""

Pandagram concluded with, ""We will show you Pritz's intention and will to resolve the misunderstanding regarding the armbands, and through more and more activities we will make it known that Pritz is not a 'Nazi Group'.""

Netizens expressed their thoughts regarding the agency's response with the top comments reading, ""Even before they started they failed... Just pack your bags"", ""Even in Germany, anyone who does anything related to the Nazi symbol can get arrested; in our country, which is still hurting from events in history as well, is there no one around you who could point this out or advise you about this?"", ""Just stop giving them attention, that's the answer"", and more.

I happen to be in Korea studying abroad, and got a few chances to go to bigger concerts, but this was the first solo concert I went to. Today was Akdong Musician's second concert in Seoul. Two of my friends and I went to the concert. Fangoods opened up at 4 PM KST, and they had a pretty cool selection of goods. My friends and I only bought lightsticks and a sweater, but they had some stickers, phonecases and other things.

Disclaimer: I have a really bad memory and I'm not 100% familiar with all of Akdong Musician's songs, so I'll only mention what I remember, but I'll try to be detailed.

The concert started at 6 PM, and it started with Give Love and 200%, which were beyond my expectations. They then had a short talk, before they went into a few more songs. The talks were so good, and AkMu was definitely a lot more charismatic than I thought they would be. I was already a pretty big fan before, but I'm definitely a fan of them now that I went to the concert.

I'd heard beforehand that a few guests showed up on the first night, and the guests that showed up the first night showed up for today as well! At this point, Soohyun left the stage and let Chanhyuk do a bit of a solo. Now this was hilarious, because he ""transformed"" into  aka ""the god of music"" and became a ""different"" person. Putting in perspective, he descended from the skies as Jesus. I wish I could show everyone that moment, but it was accompanied by a video and everything. Absolutely perfect. After his solo dance/song, he announced a special guest, and everyone already had heard that it was IU.

IU.

IU then came out and performed a song with him, before performing  , The Meaning of you. IU quickly left the stage (she was so gorgeous), and then Soohyun got a chance to do her solo, which was a dance to NoNoNo, and then switch to Darling.

They then went back to their normal songs, and stopped doing choreography for a few songs, notably Melted, before Soohyun got a chance to do her duet with Lee Hi for I'm Different. Bobby didn't show up, but Chanhyuk decided to pop up and pretend to be Bobby for a while. Lee Hi then performed 1,2,3,4 and was absolutely amazing live.

A bit out of order, I will say that   (Foreigner's Confession) and Little Star were two of the most amazing performances they did, but I can't for the life of me remember when they did the sets. They also at some point brought two random audience members up and magically made ramen for them. I wish I were joking about randomly, but they did a magic trick on stage which was pretty cool. 

The ending was really cool, ending with . After they left the stage, the crowd probably cheered ""Encore"" for what felt like a solid five minutes. When they finally came on, they started with Time and Fallen Leaves (I was waiting for this and it was gorgeous live). They then changed, and did an AMAZING cover of I Am The Best, before finishing with Crescendo.

I can try to answer more questions if anyone has any about Korea in general for concerts, but I figured someone should hear about the experience. I'll add pics and videos soon!

EDIT:
Also, YG had two different interview things set up where they interviewed concert attendees after the show to show Akdong Musician. I hope they don't upload it to youtube, because if that's the case we're going to get really a awkward video of like four Americans talking to the camera. ",12,59

I'm not talking about people who have redebuted in another group, like Hyunseung or Mino, and found success. 

Prominent ones I can think of are [May Doni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zW2TcVEFcc), former YG trainee who was supposed to debut with Minzy, [CCM girl group](http://www.karaholic.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=17436), which Youngji of KARA was part of, Jino, the guy in SM the Ballad, and [G-Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVoRIHdk1ZI), a JYP trainee who was supposed to debut in the US along with Min. If G-Soul debuts he will have been a trainee for 13/14 years. ",45,24

1060,2014-11-24,2014,11,24,21,2n9agj,Kpop Album Review: APink Takes the Initiative with its 90s-Style Kpop Girl Group Music,bluesea2327,1416831838,"APink released its new album 'Pink LUV' on November 24, while the album has a total of 5 songs including the title track 'LUV'. Have you listened to the album? As soon as being released, 'LUV' topped various online music charts, and APink absolutely proved its dominance in the world of Kpop.

Well, there are some reasons for APink's success. Pretty and lovely looks of the members? Yes, of course. But, I mean, in terms of music, APink has some unique characteristics.

You may have heard of some of legendary Kpop girl groups' names such as SES and Fin.K.L. SES and Fin.K.L are called first generation Kpop girl groups, while the girl groups were hugely popular in the 90s. You can say that the groups are the roots of second and third generation Kpop girl groups such as Girls' Generation, 2NE1, Wonder Girls, f(x), Girl's Day, and APink because lots of Kpop agencies followed the example of SES and Fin.K.L in producing new girl groups.

For the last 20 years, there have been so many Kpop girl groups, and the musical styles of the girl groups gradually changed too. Actually, idol music goes out of date very, very quickly these days.

However, APink's new song 'LUV' goes against the trend. The song reminds people of Kpop girl groups' music in the 90s, while the song's melody progresses in a similar way to SES or Fin.K.L's old hits. As you can see in the case of APink's another song 'NoNoNo' too, the girl group has been sticking to this strategy for years. Because of this, yes, there sometimes has been a plagiarism controversy over APink's album. But I think it's quite a smart strategy. Why?

The repetitive chorus of 'LUV' including the lyrics ""L.O.V.E LUV"" is very very catchy, and the rhythm and melody of the song are easy to learn, while Korean music fans who are familiar to 90s-style kpop girl group music, may feel like they've listened to the song before. These days, there's very few Kpop girl groups who release songs that have a simple, retro-style melody just like APink. In this way, APink was able to differentiate it from other girl groups, and took the initiative in the world of Kpop.

1122,2014-11-26,2014,11,26,1,2ndsqw,Megan Lee files lawsuit requesting nullification of contract + Soul Shop Entertainment responds,[deleted],1416932566,"Megan Lee has filed a lawsuit requesting a nullification of her contract against her label Soul Shop Entertainment.

Megan Lee's side said, ""*The singer was burdened because the label used their higher position to express unfair control on most clauses such as the penalty fee on breaking the contract. Also, she had overseas schedules agreed on by the label, but they signed a contract with the musical* ***'All Shook Up'*** *without her consent even though they knew this. When signing the musical contract, they used Megan Lee's seal that was provided to create a bank account for her without her permission.*""

It's also been reported that Gilgun, also under the same label, had also filed a lawsuit. They explained, ""*While Gilgun was a part of the label for the past 1 year and 4 months, she had no single song or schedule. When the label found out she wanted to nullify her contract, the label sent a certification of contents telling her to leave after paying 2 times the contract fee. We have not replied to that yet.*""

Soul Shop Entertainment responded through an official statement and said,

&gt;1. The contract's length, as specified in the contract, was signed to be 5 years from her debut date. Compared to the 7 years marked by the Fair Trade Commission, this is shorter.   
2. Excluding her song and album sales, all of her profits after the expenses are taken out, the [label and Megan Lee] split the profits 50% to 50%, and we would like to state that this is not at all unfair to the rookie Megan Lee even when compared to other artists.   
3. The label getting the monopolistic rights to management is not different from the standard contract specified by the Fair Trade Commission.   
4. Megan Lee's mother Lee Hee Jung did not notify the label and emailed the musical company King and I Company on November 21, 2014, by herself saying that [Megan] will not be attending practice or the performance. This was 7 days before the performance.   

&gt;The core of this situation is as below.

&gt;On May 11, 2014, an American entertainment agency asked Megan Lee to audition, and the label sent Megan Lee's audition video to the USA, but until 4 months later on September 2014, the label received nothing about the audition.
Soul Shop received a request [for Megan] to audition for the musical 'All Shook Up', and she auditioned publicly on September 1, 2014, and signed the contract on appearing in the musical on September 12, 2014.   
Afterwards, on October 21, 2014, Soul Shop Entertainment was told from the American agency that she will be participating in the final audition for a USA drama without conferring the label.   
After, Megan Lee sent a one-sided notification to the label on November 16, 2014, went to the United States, and was accepted in the final audition, which conflicted with her musical schedule. On November 19, 2014, Megan Lee came back to Korea, did not notify the label, and continued her participation in the musical practice.   
 During this time, Megan's mother didn't tell our company, but instead, the musical production company through a one-sided email telling them that she will not be attending practice, the performance, and of the lawsuit. Because of this, the musical producers, the musical participants, and our label found ourselves in a helpless situation that we could not respond to.   
As a label in the public entertainment business, we are very sorry to relay another bad news. The label will do our best in the following lawsuit.
Once again, Soul Shop Entertainment apologizes for worrying everyone.

1132,2014-11-26,2014,11,26,5,2neksk,[Fan Account] Vixx Hex Sign in Chicago Concert + High Touch,ihateredmonkeys,1416946132,"Three of my friends and I flew from Dallas, Texas up to Chicago to see our all time top group, VIXX! Two of my friends were able to see them last year when they stopped in Dallas for their Milkyway tour, but my other friend and I got to experience our first kpop concert in all the glory that is VIXX! 

It was a roller coaster of a emotions and and unforgettable experience. I'll try to break down the whole process without being excessive. 

**Arriving at the venue:**
My friends and I arrived at the venue at around 2:30pm. We expected the doors to open at 5 and the show to start at 7. When we arrived there were only a dozen or so people hanging out in the breezeway of the entrance. Everyone was dressed up and many people were cosplaying. There were a cute set of sisters with full On and On costumes (picture in album) as well as a ton of people with hand made fan costumes and variations of VIXX inspired makeup. There were even a few groups doing dance covers while there was still room. The three friends I was with and I were all part of a VOODOO cover dance we did last semester so we went ahead and danced that for everyone on the spot. We were pretty glad we were some of the first people there, within an hour the whole breezeway was full and a crowd started forming outside. We were scrunched together like sardines and ended up standing there together until they finally let us in around 6:30pm.

**The Q&amp;A board:** At 6:00pm they announced they were running a little behind schedule. A few staff members brought out a table, a large board, and a bunch of sticky note pads. They asked us to pass around the sticky notes and write down any questions we had for VIXX! I was really impressed by the cooperation of everyone and the orderly manner everyone passed things around and got the board covered (in the shape of a heart!) with the notes!

**The Lobby:** Imagine black Friday, but worse. Again, I am super thankful my group was one of the first through the doors because we were able to get to the merch table quickly. The merch table had a lot more items than I was expecting! They had black beanies with the Rovix logo for $25, black snapbacks with the logo for $25, black snapbacks with just VIXX on it for $25, foam thunder sticks with tons of light options for $15, and hoodies either black or white with the Rovix logo for $45. Some girls there mentioned they were shocked at the prices, because with their experiences before at a BTS concert hoodies had been $95. I bought a thunder stick and Rovix snap back, everything was super high quality and definitely worth the price!

**The Show:**
The show finally started about 7:20pm. I can not fully express to you the feeling I experienced once it finally began. The entire first half of the first song I stood with my jaw dropped because of the unreal-ness of it all. It was an out of body experience. My friends, on the other hand, seemed to all lose their minds in a very vocal way. There. Was. So. Much. Screaming. We made the effort of learning fan chants, but as expected, most American fans don't know fan chants and the crowd was more or less just singing along or screaming at the top of their lungs. 

They started off with Error surprisingly. Seeing them dance live was surreal. It is SO different than just watching a recording. Their stage presence is super powerful and they are beyond talented and skilled. Unfortunately security was super tight and it was pretty hard to get pictures or video without being yelled at. That being said, there are still TONS of pictures and video out there. 

**The Q&amp;A and Host:** Ugh, I could rant about the translator/host lady for days. She was really nervous and wasn't doing a good job translating at all. Her English was pretty poor, and she would sometimes just flat out just acknowledge what the members said and not translate it for the crowd. Other times she would get flustered and gesture too much without holding he mic up to her face. When she did manage to get something out I could tell she was only relaying half of the message, even with my minimal knowledge of the Korean language. Leader N was getting really fed up with the translator at some points and even had moment where he would say something and she would flat out not say anything afterward in attempts to translate (when she was off stage). N would wait a few moments and after hearing nothing, (looking frustrated) would just continue to say whatever he had to say. The crowd would very happily respond to whatever they had to say in unison, despite that maybe less than half the crowd really knew what he was saying, haha. 

When it was time for the Q&amp;A readings and break, the lady was so flustered and took such a long time trying to talk and pick questions that we ended up only being able to do 2 in total. The first question was chosen by Hyuk and it read ""Can you please wink at me? - Mindy"" That Mindy was quick to stand out in the crowd and successfully received a wink from Hyukkie! It was super adorable! The second question was picked by Ravi and read ""What is your favorite American food?"" this question was actually written by my friend I was with, so that was very exciting! After thinking for a bit Ravi replied ""Steak!"" and Ken, next to him, very cutely added ""Pizzzzaaa!"" 

The host asked a question to the group as a whole in very broken English, something along the lines of, ""What do you think your fans love so much about you?"" Ravi answered with, ""Concept, vocal, image, and-"" after standing up from his seat, extending a leg, and gesturing at himself ""-body?"" Of course the crowd lost it. Pretty sure I heard about 50 ovaries burst. It was fantastic. 

After the host cut them off after 2 questions she said it was her turn to get ""her wish"" which was to *hug all of the members*! This of course pretty much started a riot in the audience. Everyone was screaming NO NO NO NO and making X's. Even most of VIXX was saying ""noooo"" and looked very concerned. After a bunch of dicking around (for an amount of time where at least 2 more questions could have been asked and answered) Hyuk, taking one for the team, volunteered to give her a hug. It was awkward and cringey. No one was happy. 

Moving on..

The rest of the show was astounding and beautiful. God bless the costume designers and their choice for the tight white pants. God bless them. 

Some highlights I loved:

* The white pants
* Leo's stage presence, holy balls, that boy is something
* Ravi's hands were trembling after the first few dances, I could feel his adrenaline!
* Hyuk is quickly leaving his boyhood behind and becoming the man none of us were prepared for.
* Ken commented in English ""Chicago is very... HOT!"" and then shivered, hahahahaha. We all burst out laughing. Pretty sure he just got hot and cold mixed up.
* N's dancing is RIDICULOUS. It looks effortless
* Hongbin's 5'oclock shadow of only a mustache
* Leo's mic going out during a non-dancing song and having to steal everyone else's
* Again, those white pants

**The High Touch:**

This was not something I was spiritually prepared for. We walked down the aisle in the blink of an eye and before I had a moment to think, Hongbin's soul crushing dimples were right in front of me. I was so in shock I'm pretty sure I just looked like a deer in headlights  for the first three and only managed to shakily say ""kamsahamnida"" to the last three, even though I had originally planned on making kissy faces at Ken and saying '""ottokaji."" All of that pretty much went out the window.

Honestly it went by so quickly and I was in such shock I have a hard time recalling most of it. 

* Hongbin: His eyes lit up when he first looked at me, which I'm pretty sure is what set me up for failure for the rest of the time. I can not explain how freaking FLAWLESS this boys are in person. No photograph will ever show you what you see when you have them right in front of you. They are GORGEOUS. I could have drowned in his dimples and his eyes could light up the deepest pits of hell. No exaggeration. 

* Hyuk: Fucking HELL that boy is a MAN now! He looks so composed and refined and all of his mannerisms were just so gentle and careful. He was my original favorite when I started with VIXX and he's always pulled at my heartstrings. 

* Ken: I was doomed from the start with Hongbin, but to be followed by my Hyuk and Ken I was in complete la-la land before I made it to Leo. Once I had Ken in front of me I knew I wanted to make a kissy face at him in hopes he might do it back, but a part of me was just too humbled that I felt it almost would have been.. disrespectful? I noticed Ken just looked tired throughout most of the performance, despite his grins and playful attitude. He's been super busy with his sitcom and other promotions so I'm sure he's feeling overwhelmed. 

* N: I'm honestly not sure if it was N or Leo first, like I said, I was in shock. N just looked genuinely happy. His hands were, as rumor says, the softest (all though they were all like touching clouds of heaven). He held all the dignity of a leader and the love of a mother proud of her children.

* Leo: I've never been a huge Leo fan, but damn he really impressed me. I won't ever believe the things some people say about him being shy or self-concious. That boy is 100% aware of every move he makes and every word that comes out of his mouth. I feel like he plays everyone like puppets, and has everyone wrapped around his little finger. His gaze was striking but almost flirtatious. That little lion has a lot going on in that quiet head of his. 

* Ravi: Ravi looked particularly tired as well, but he was very dignified and respectful. He gave me a little nod and a smile after I said thank you but otherwise was pretty timid. 

10/10 would touch again.

The security was almost a little overboard.. a BUNCH of really intimidating huge guys towered over you while you walked between them and VIXX for the high touch. I think that kind of dampened the mood a bit, but it's understandable. 

Overall it was super fun and worth it. The experience was unreal and I feel did alter my opinion about k-pop culture as a whole.

These are songs I personally like very much and decided to share since I had nothing better to do this evening, and I know how many people just don't bother listening to whole albums ""because of the amount of bad songs"". There are just ~80 songs right now. Will add more whenever I have time.

&gt; Comment: *I suppose I can temporarily take over the weekly music performance threads since /u/sangtoms might be busy. I will normally order the performances based on alphabetical order of the Artist names. Most of the links will be updated to the respective Official Youtube channel. If in the event the Official channels are not updated in due time, I will more than likely use other users uploading their direct feed rips.*

&gt; *If I made any mistakes, feel free to point them out and I will promptly edit them.*",24,52
