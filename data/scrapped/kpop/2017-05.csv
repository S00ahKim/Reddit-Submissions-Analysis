    Mod Application

As our community continues to grow, keeping up with new posts and managing the features we run takes a lot of time.  With several of our older mods still on indefinite hiatus, we'd like to send out a call for new mods.  If you're interested in helping out, shaping our community, and contributing to the subreddit, please apply.  You'll have to make difficult decisions, sometimes piss people off, and take some abuse, but if you like being a leader and have a thick skin, it's a rewarding job.  The mod application is linked here:

https://goo.gl/forms/UVpEyDtyoJxhbOs92

Please fill it out as soon as possible.  We'll be looking to bring on one or two new mods.  Bonus points if you live in Europe or Asia, as we are looking for more mod support when US mods are asleep.  But don't be discouraged if you live in the US.  We could use always more helpful people.

&amp;nbsp;

    Spotify Links

We currently have an amazing section of the subreddit behind the [Upcoming K-Pop Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/upcoming-releases/2017/may) button on the sidebar.  This section contains all of the upcoming releases and is updated with links to the Music Video and the Spotify page almost as soon as they are released.  As such, direct links to Spotify are redundant and will be removed **unless** it's not covered by this page.  Let us know if you have any thoughts about this policy.

&amp;nbsp;

    Idols Who Left Korea

Recently, we've seen new releases from idols who have left Korea and gone to China or elsewhere like Luhan, Meng Jia, Kris, etc.  When, if ever, should these artists no longer be considered relevant to KPop?  This includes both news items and music releases.  If the community wants to continue following their careers, we have no issues with that, but we'd like to hear your feedback.  Should there be a time limit on it, like a year?  Should we just allow them and let the votes decide?  These submissions don't happen often, but let us know if you'd like to craft a rule, or just let them go.

&amp;nbsp;

    First Win Ever

A group's first ever win on a music show is one of the most treasured and memorable moments in Kpop.  As such, we'd like to add first ever wins as an exception to the Music Show rule.  We've already been allowing them, but it wasn't formally written into the rules.  We don't think this change will be controversial, but we like to run all rules changes past the community.  Let us know if you feel strongly against this change.

&amp;nbsp;

    New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",49,46,False,self,,,,,

Those of us that are at the far end of the bell curve, I think, have a different perspective on Kpop.  Especially those of us that became fans well into our adult years.  When I became a fan of kpop in my late 20's I was already in the work force working 50 hours a week.  I was married (going through divorce proceedings currently, it's a good, happy thing, I promise), I was a home owner with a mortgage, and a car loan, and blah blah blah adult stuff.  I was teased for my Kpop interest but it never bothered me.  But what I did find a bit bothersome was finding a kpop/life balance.  Kpop led to Kdrama, which is super time consuming if you're binge watching a series.  My bills took precedent over buying albums.  Surgeries for my pets ensured I never even contemplated buying concert tickets.  And so on.

Nowadays, in my early 30's Kpop is woven into my daily routine.  I listen to it on my drive to work and am lucky enough to have a cool job where I can listen to it on my headphones when I want to at my desk.  However, buying albums are very rare and I've still to this day never been able to afford to go to a concert.  I'm not super bummed because concerts aren't really my thing to begin with.  However, in the beginning it felt almost heartbreaking to miss out on those things, until I found a better kpop/life balance.

Have any of you found ways to work in the more expensive aspects of the Kpop world?  Do you go to concerts a lot?  If you have children, how do they feel about it?  Do you spend money on Kpop when you want to or are you more frugal?  What dictates this kpop/life balance for you, what external factors (work, school, family, etc)?",63,97,False,self,,,,,

INSTEAD OF JUST WESTERN, I MEANT ANY OTHER GENRE OTHER THAN KPOP, MUSIC OUTSIDE THE KPOP SPHERE OF SORTS. MY BAD.**




I'm simply curious to see if people who like kpop on this sub-reddit have similar taste in music, or the complete opposite, or in between... 




So comment your favorite non kpop artists and see is you can find connections to kpop groups you stan. And comment on others to see if there's a pattern arising!




An example: Although there is nothing truly like *stanning* a kpop group, I'm a big fan of 70s rock, funk, synth pop, any pop, folk music and hip hop. Obviously all over the map. Which is maybe why I like kpop, because of the fusion of so many genres within one song/album. 



Then there are artists who I can directly see a relation with kpop like [Grimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOwhuTlxE54) or [Kero Kero Bonito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qmwsg2pyEc). Grimes cited kpop as an influence to her most recent album Art Angels, and that led me to discovering kpop. If you haven't checked out either of these acts, I highly recommend.",73,28,False,self,,,,,

But, I feel like if I watch SR again, it'll probably trump SMTM. I think the voting system for School Rapper was much more effective and not as biased, and the rappers were more likeable and the editing was much less annoying.

She then tops it off by gloating about a friend of hers stealing Kasper's boyfriend, and says if she sees her on SMTM, she should pick her to battle.

Kasper [fired back](https://soundcloud.com/officialkasper/cievri77w2b4) by calling Jucy a failed idol who needs to worry about her own future, and that if she knew the concert appearance was originally for her, she'd have asked for more money. She also comes for Jucy by saying that she wants to be on UPRS so badly, but can't make the cut. She accuses Jucy of just trying to start some shit to make it to SMTM and get more screentime. And she also mentions she had already broken up with the guy, so Jucy's friend being with him doesn't bother her at all.

Andrew from Truly Daebak here, and this is episode 17 of the DaebakCast.

[
\[Click here to watch\]](https://youtu.be/qdFG9PYE5yg)

In this episode, we made the daunting task of listening to every song (with an MV) released in the month of April. Shoutouts to the mod team here at /r/kpop for organizing the fancy spreadsheet that makes our lives much easier.

We listened to every good song, and every bad song (and boy are there a lot of bad songs), so enjoy our thoughts on them.

Feel free to leave any feedback, start a discussion, or let us know how we can improve the show.

VIPs, EXO-L, and ARMYs come to top of mind as I thought about this. I'm sure you could think of a few more. But I don't think I've ever seen people go as hard for a group....or any person really.

But if we've learned anything from Spiderman, it's that ""...with great power comes great responsibility"" 

I know these groups see the great lengths (many times overextended efforts imho) their fandoms go to all in the name of ""supporting"" them. But is it sometimes too much? 

Do you think these groups feel pressured to accomplish more and make more sacrifices so that their fans will be happy? Whether it be putting out more records, more touring, extended promotions, etc. 

I've seen many groups who already work like robots say they feel like they let down their fans of something doesn't go right, or they see the reactions fans have when something doesn't go their way.

Since its release, I've used [Speed's Pain The Love of Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUwJxKkhNo&amp;spfreload=10) instrumental. The first 30 seconds are perfect for a ringtone! I love the 8-bit sound (as I tend to love most Bravesound stuff).

Before that, I used [Teen Top's To You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn4R8Y-hRfY&amp;spfreload=10) which, yeah, came first and sounds very similar to Speed's song. Guess my taste isn't as original. :) 

What do you all use as your ringtone? Why that song? Bonus points if it's not a title track! 

And yes, before someone says it, we all have had Ring Ding Dong as our ringtone at some point. (Also, if this is better suited for r/kpopslumberparty, I apologize. I just know we've had this kind of thread here before.)",144,64,False,self,,,,,

1. [Onew being Onew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V1_UBKffTk). What the hell happened at that concert? Where's the longer version of the fancam? It seems like this one does not exist; only 11-second versions pop up when I search for it.

Seeing the different fandoms vote like crazy for BTS in the BMAs makes me feel warm inside. K-pop is a whole industry and we were able to all support eachother. Even though stupid fan wars happen all the time, it's normal but we all want the same thing. The idols that pump out these incredible songs, work so hard for us. They are more engaging with their fans than western artists are. It honestly gave me confidence to be more outgoing watching these idols embarrass them selves on TV. I swear kpop idols are the kings/queens of fan service. But kpop has been such a big part of my life for so long. I remember hearing Super Junior's Mr. Simple for the first time and regardless of not understanding a word, it got stuck in my head for a while. That started my dark journey down the kpop hole and now I can't get out. But hey, I ain't complaining.

This is where I am torn, it's their channel and they can do whatever they want, we get to see them for free so we can't bitch if they want to earn some side revenue. And to add on to this, if my favorite idols are earning some money off of it then supporting them this way is also nice. While the prices for individual Ch+ ain't much it stacks up if you want to support various idol groups and it also doesn't include their VLive+ packages.

You can also use this thread to argue that it's just your bias showing through (but reminder that you can also love someone so much but not really enjoy their music or enjoy just a couple of songs).

For me, the answer is yes with two folks:

SHINee's **Jonghyun** has never made a bad song but specifically, his R&amp;B work is my favorite. He just gets the genre and its purpose (which isn't always sexy ""baby-making"" music), and in general I notice his songs never have a weird pause or weird additives; space is filled purposefully and each song flows well with each part of the song being essential or at least valuable to the song's meaning.

**LE** is another where I just...I really have no idea what song of hers I don't like other than ""L.I.E"", but she understands EXID's dynamic vocal-wise and each member's strengths and she works with them rather than not. She also pays attention to EXID's overall sound and type of music that works with them rather than stuff that sounds good to the public or is trendy.

Explain - is it down to the colour scheme? The acting? The aesthetics? The camera work? The lyrics? The meaning/message behind the song? etc. etc.

I'll start off with [WINNER(Taehyun)'s I'm Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P79G22cJe74). The song was written and composed by Taehyun, based on real events that he had experienced. The lyrics are beautiful and so is the song. Taehyun also features in the MV, and his acting is really really good, probably down to the fact that he has personally experienced the scenario which he has written in the song. The lyrics are portrayed well in the MV and don't think I can fault the MV at all. The [killer part](https://youtu.be/P79G22cJe74) is when the ring drops and the water spills...it makes me sad everytime as I see it as a symbol for Taehyun leaving WINNER.

how do you deal with not having any fellow kpop fan pals irl? i really wish i could find people that also liked and were interested in kpop in person. i live in a small town basically on the border of oklahoma and kansas so the kpop fans i find are few and far between and unfortunately they're all more koreaboos than fans (obsessed with asian men to the point of fetishizing strangers in a grocery store just bc they /might/ be korean and sprinkling random korean in sentences) and i tried to get my friends into it but they're not interested and have preconceived notions about it (idols are basically made in a factory and are completely artificial, everyone has plastic surgery and wants to be white, boy groups are too feminine, girl groups infantalize themselves for grown men who are probably pedophiles etc etc)
and that really sucks. i am so envious of groups of friends who can get excited about comebacks and go to concerts together and im sitting here reading it all on reddit, twitter and tumblr

im getting a bit off track but if you don't have any irl kpop friends do you wish you did? if you do how did you find each other? is finding kpop friends worth wading through the constant streams of koreaboos?",24,1,False,self,,,,,

It got me thinking what style of MV do you tend to like best? 

I feel like a lot of full dance MV's like [EXO's Overdose](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=TI0DGvqKZTI) (well technically there's a bit of story at the beginning and end) for example are done really well, but lack some of the fun and entertainment you can get from a really well directed MVs. BTS's [I Need U](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NMdTd9e-LEI) and [Run](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=5Wn85Ge22FQ) had really cool story lines, but I feel like they lost a lot because they excluded the really cool choreo those songs had. Striking a balance is hard too, [Dreamcatcher's Good Night](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Lxfl8LRab_I) had super cool choreo at the beginning that got cut out of the MV along with other cool parts in favor of more ""story"" type stuff. I feel like [I.O.I's Whatta Man](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fOn5tSagerY) struck a good balance between choreo and story. They kept all the best parts of the choreo, but also kept a fun storyline in it.

So what do you think is the best balance for an MV? Is there any you wish had more story or more choreography? Any you thought struck a good balance? Which kind do you prefer?",28,29,False,self,,,,,

I am asking this because I've been thinking about why I personally like the groups I like. It's interesting to analyze what is it that I got so hooked onto them? So I will kind of go through all of my bias.    



Twice - Life is hard guys, and I think I got into Twice because their music/MV are so uplifting. They are all so happy and really radiate positivity. So I really think I started stanning them because every time I see them or watch their shows/twice TV, it's like a light-hearted treat at the end of the day to unwind (you know, since life is stressful &amp; hard). And Twice members &amp; their personality are just so warm &amp; welcoming. It's like an escape from all the real life negative things.    
 

SISTAR - I have been listening to Sistar for a while now and I totally fell in love with ""Gone not around any longer"". Anyway, I think they have such a healthy image so ultimately Hyolyn and Bora just became WCE. Body goals, dance goals, and voice goals for sure! So I will always follow their music and see what they have next :)     

AOA - I got into AOA recently, and other than them being WCE too, I actually really like their music. Their music is super catchy and always put me in a good mood. I also really like Jimin because from a few unpretty rapstar clips, she is super talented! In this group, I also like that everyone kinda stands out a lot in their own way. I think at this point, I can say that kpop has a pretty big influence on my mood and helps a lot with making me feel better.     


CLC - Some of the reasons why I stan them is also pretty personal. Elkie is from my hometown Hong Kong so I gotta support! Also, with the start of PRODUSORN, I like them even more. They are so personable and it's really nice to be able to see how hard they work. I know all idols work hard, but that's not always transparent. When idols come out to talk about their lives kinda off the mainstream TV media/camera, it really show us that idols are just... regular people that are around you and me. Like, I feel like I could totally chill with CLC. haha     

Does anyone feel the same way about these groups above? How do yall feel about your own biases?

1. **Lucia -  6** This is a not so popular song, but I can listen this song for hours on loop, or even days. Even the [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKLnvBrydgE) is pretty good.
2. **Girls Generation - [Gee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ)** Listen boy, My first love story *Start crying of happiness*. Yes, I fanboy every single time this song plays.
3. **Song Ji Eun - [Twenty-Five(  25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT9MPZRzQn8)** I discover this song through my music service, and can't help but fall in love with it.
4. **Red Velvet - [7 7 (One Of These Nights)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xWiro_tS1k)** This song just hit me so hard. The main reason because I stan Red Velvet was because of this song, is just so beautiful.
5. **I.O.I - [ - (Very Very Very)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1hxg1rY17I)** Girls Generation meets Red Velvet. I just can't live without this song.

On our [Kpop podcast](https://soundcloud.com/beyondkpop/the-kpop-dis-tew-much-episode) this week we talked a little about the frequency of Kpop concerts popping up in America. Since Jan, we've had close to 10-12 concerts happen back to back (got7, b1a4, b.a.p, jessi, dean, bts, exo, sxsw, etc) and there are MORE coming this summer (kcon, monsta x, GD, M-fact, etc). So, there are a few parts for this question, (1) Do you think these concerts are happening too frequently, why or why not? (2) How do you plan financially for all these shows back to back? (3) Do you feel like you're missing out because you don't have proper planning time to make arrangements for the acts you want to see?

929,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-5-13,2017,5,13,2,6aspea,self.kpop,"I wrote this over in r/music. ""Psy is underrated because of Gangnam Style.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6aspea/i_wrote_this_over_in_rmusic_psy_is_underrated/,treytakzona,1494609991,"I decided to do a little write up on Psy because I feel like people think Gangnam Style defines him, and I think it's very shallow to say the least. Psy is so much more than one viral MV on YouTube. In fact, Gangnam Style is probably the one song by Psy that has become too popular for its own good. 

I am not here to persuade you to like Psy and his music. In fact, I have been disappointed with some of his American tracks (i.e. Hangover). I'm just to give a little more depth to the character that is Psy: not just a fun-loving, chubby Korean with a yearning for dancing and soju, but a man with a keen love for music. 

&gt;Psy: A South Korean singer, rapper, record producer, and songwriter. 

He was born Park Jae Sang in 1977 in the affluent neighborhoods of Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea. He was inspired at a young age to pursue his dream of music after watching Queen perform Bohemian Rhapsody on TV. 

In 1996, Psy enrolled at Boston University as a business administration major, preparing to take over his father's business. However, against his father's wishes, he spent most of his tuition on musical instruments and electronic equipment. He dropped out of BU and decided to enroll at Berklee College of Music instead, where he took various lessons (i.e. music synthesis) before returning to South Korea to pursue his career as a singer.

In January 2001, Psy released his debut kpop/rap album *Psy from the Psycho World!*, for which he was fined by the government for highly suggestive and controversial lyrics. Keep in mind, South Korea is an extremely conservative country even today, and was even more so 16 years ago. To give you a bit of an idea of what Psy released in this album, one of his songs is entitled **""I Love Sex""**.  

But don't let ""I Love Sex"" steer you away from the fact that this debut album was chock full of meaningful and thoughtful tracks. He was only one of a few who challenged Korean cultural and societal norms and led a revolution in the Korean music industry, which up to that point was highly conservative. 

Psy came into the Korean music scene right when it needed him and vice versa. Korean culture in those times was just beginning to open up and embrace new things, especially in social media and entertainment, so it was a match made in heaven. The Korean music scene was dying for something less conventional, more dynamic, and provoking, and Psy provided these in spades. His rap influences at this time were Eminem, Dr. Dre, 2Pac, and Jay Z. 

Psy has since released 7 albums, including his 8th multi-genre album entitled *4 x 2= 8*, which was released two days ago. 

Note: it's called 4 x 2 = 8 because it's the 8th album and in Korean, the word Psy sounds like 4 x 2. 

Some highlights from the 8th album: 

[New Face MV ft. Naeun]
(https://youtu.be/OwJPPaEyqhI)
This is a high energy dance track, like Gangnam Style. 

[I Luv U]
(https://youtu.be/Xvjnoagk6GU) 
I Luv U hasn't really grown on me yet, but it's a decent track. 

[Auto Reverse ft. Tablo]
(https://youtu.be/GHECvj1splk)
Auto Reverse is probably one of my favorite tracks on the whole album. It features my favorite rapper of all time, Tablo (but that's another story for later). For old school hip hop lovers, you'll probably like this one. 

[Refuge ()]
(https://youtu.be/coiOZVNrToQ)
 directly translates to: A Place Where I can Lean On, so it's based on the premises of Bill Withers' Lean On Me. It's a soothing, calming melody to lean on after a long day.  

Some other noteworthy Psy tracks over the years: 

[Father]
(https://youtu.be/ig8AaFSzzGI)
Right in the feels. 

[It's Art]
(https://youtu.be/O7ohKqL_OPU)

[Champion] 
(https://youtu.be/8FiMA-BXAmY)
This was the jam back in the day. 

I hope people can give him a chance. I know he has had his fair share of controversies, but Psy is a much better musician than people give him credit for.
 
Thanks for reading everyone, have a great day.

Is this how every year is?

They announced that they were postponing EXID literally a day before the convention started, then KARD nearly had to cancel tonight because of all the technical difficulties, most likely caused by the convention organizers not giving them the accommodation they needed. 

I thought KARD did an absolutely amazing job and I would definitely see them again, but if this is how TKC usually is, I don't think I'll be coming back or even supporting a convention that's inviting these groups and then not supporting them correctly. It looks so bad on TKC and gives a bad impression of Canada..

1023,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-5-14,2017,5,14,7,6b0k0i,self.kpop,Very late fanaccount of Jonghyun's Inspiration concerts,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6b0k0i/very_late_fanaccount_of_jonghyuns_inspiration/,L-autrichienne,1494714007,"I know there was already a fanaccount posted of this, but I figured I'd throw this out just in case anyone was particularly interested in my POV haha.


So I did Global Package for the whole thing to guarantee good seats and merch. I ended up with standing the first concert, a fairly central seat second concert, and a side seat third concert (both of those first row so excellent seats all around). For Global Package this round all we did was have our pictures professionally taken at SM with a giant pic of Jonghyun. It was awkward as fuck and those shots will NEVER see the light of day again. Also the dessert said Jonghyun. All in all rather underwhelming compared to the backstage tour for SWC5.


So I'm going to just go throughout the nights willy-nilly. Like some moments from each. Most will come from the first and last concerts though because they were the best seats and I had some really excellent moments during those.


So its time. I have to make a decision, wear a coat to the venue or not. I choose to not wear a coat, which resulted in me being very cold in a tiny dress in the standing line. But my gamble paid off once in standing. Due to the nature of the stage standing was totally enclosed by the stage. For GP I had drawn one of the farthest standing ticket which just mean that out of 350 I went in 335. My friend went in 80th but you can obviously just go wherever once you're there so I glomped onto the spot my friend chose. And fucking hell she chose well.


So there we are, in standing, mere feet from the stage. I mean I was CLOSE. There was a giant glowing red X over the outer stage and two moons hanging from the ceiling of the main stage... and a track. I immediately knew that that asshole was going to be chained to a fucking X flying over me. And goddamn he did not disappoint me. 


So the usual concert filler played, which this time was all of the songs that Jonghyun has written. So there was Lim Kim and IU and all of the many songs he's written for SHINee and all of his stuff playing as we found our spots. Suddenly the volume changed and ""Tell Me What To Do"" started. We all started losing our shit naturally and singing along, getting our lightsticks and kazoos and handbells ready. Everything was innocent and we were still pure. Then the song finished.


The lights dimmed fully, our beautiful ocean was quivering in anticipation. Then the opening VCR came on. And we all immediately died. 


So Shawols are old ok. We have really good control of ourselves and are poised and shit right. No. When that VCR came on we just went to shit. The dance involves Jonghyun just covered in a pile of men with sparkly tight black full face masks on. Shirtless. All shirtless. And Jonghyun is like trying to get up but they're pulling him back down. Then there are white girls. And they're projecting ""Be Quiet"" onto his pecs. And the eyeliner, MY GOD THE EYELINER. We were just in the pit choking on our feelings. Like breaking friends finger bones and slapping the shit out of strangers. Some chick pulled my hair in distress. I have no idea who nor do I blame her. Then suddenly everyone screamed and we turned around to see Jonghyun suspended above us, the glowing X moving over the crowd. Him shirtless and chained. I didn't think shit could get anymore real but somehow it did. Screams became gutteral, whimpering more desperate, and girl on girl violence escalated. The standing pit was a den of sin and I was dead center, just as wild and overcome as the rest. 


Since this FA is hella late, I'm sure Yall have seen plenty of fancams, but I'll just say those opening songs were enough to kill us, sending us all to early Graves. The choice I made to not wear a coat and just freeze outside had paid off. When Jonghyun was onstage body rolling in ways I didn't know were possible with those aerialists behind him during Moon, I was on fire. Everyone was. The energy in standing was just insane, it was alive. And Jonghyun knew it too and was just loving picking one girl out at a time to destroy. Constant eye contact with fans and extended ones at times. Every time he looked at me my knees full on gave out, but I was packed against the stage so my fellow ladies kept me upright. 


Due to the nature of the stage, in standing you couldn't see certain dances well, and I had no interest in joining the washing machine in the center of the pit and risk losing my awesome spot. I ended up going to all five nights including the two Busan stops so missing choreography wasn't an issue. 


Third night, I happened to be at the perfect side angle to see the part in Cocktail where they all take their belts off and dance with them. I could perfectly see the moment that Jonghyun dragged the belt behind him and proceed to pop his own ass with the belt. I made some seriously unholy noises. 


There was a bit of hilarity involving the Suit Up vcr too. While me friends and I in standing were dying in standing (seriously, it almost got more crazy during that when he was getting undressed with a girl than when he'd been half naked 5 ft away. We were all shouting NO NO AN DWAE, a girl next to me let out a battle scream and it seemed pretty reasonable in the moment, anyhow) my friends in seating were shifting uncomfortably in their seats because the girl in the video looked alarmingly like me. I didn't notice until the second night but she kinda did. Didn't make the vcr any less distressing. 


Random thoughts: Orbit live was life. The backup dancers killed it and just everything about that stage added to the sexiness of the song. Monodrama was as excessively dramatic as I wanted. There were a lot of mirrors involved in that dance and I remember thinking a) how shitty they were (they needed to be light so fair) and b) how I could see myself whenever he was being all dramatic, made me giggle a bit. 


The instrument this time was the hand bell. It was super noisy and he kept on being like shhh. We didn't do too horribly learning the song (IU Gloomy Clock I believe) but no one wanted to put it away so Jonghyun was like Handbell Annyeong! , and it worked like magic. It's amusing when I see him use tactics with us that I used to use with my kindy students. Jonghyun would definitely be the best kindergarten teacher out of SHINee. 


Another highlight was White T Shirt. In Seoul he went around on a cart. The third night I was in seating really close and got some excellent prolonged eye contact as he passed. The energy was great during this. Every time he'd sing it's all about you you you you you you you you The Shawols Would scream It too but while point our lightsticks at him. It was so cute. 


The concert came to an end and we waited for the encore. Got our little banners out. First night, my standing night, they said something like together let's make it 408since his birthday is 4/08. That banner was so accurate. 


He came out killing a bass to Crazy. Cue fucking dead Again. There were a shit ton of pyrotechnics during this song so indeed it was 408 degrees in standing at least. We were screaming so hard and the fire was so hot and Jonghyun was even hotter. 


This is the moment I want to give a shout out to the sweet young security guy. Unlike most security he didn't push or yell at us. He kept a bunch of cups and a jug of water and kept us hydrated. He was the best and Jjong thanked him for looking out for us at the end too. Lovely guy. 


So when the concert did end, especially after the first night, I was wrung out like a fucking rag. The exhaustion was super fucking real. But it was one of the most intense concert experiences I've had. The energy was absolutely primal at certain parts. Wild wild. 


So Ive not fallen out of fandom, still only love SHINee, just busy with life these days. I wrote the first half of this just after the concerts and the second half this morning. So second half is weak. I apologize, if you are curious about anything concerning the Inspiration concerts that I didn't mention just ask. I went to all five nights. 

The username thread kinda warmed my heart and I went to find and finish this account for Yall. 


Tl;dr: Jonghyun's Inspiration concerts were actually a seminar about getting in touch with your inner animal.

I mean, I don't personally think it would be a good thing, I'm very neutral about it. 
But I'm just wondering why companies only cast asian idols, when western-looking ones could appeal to western fandoms more (maybe). There are some mixed-raced ones like Somi and Vernon who are popular, so maybe totally western idols would be a good idea buisness wise ?

I totally get that casting a black or white idol for the sake of diversity or novelty would be questionable, but why do the companies limit themselves to asian idols when there certainly are many talented young people everywhere in the world ?

I mean in the US we don't have many asian artists so I don't mind if kpop stays ""asian idols only"", I'm just genuinely curious about why most companies never thought it would be a good idea.",57,0,False,self,,,,,

This is also my first time writing one of these so bear with me.

So, to start I am a fan of Jay Park and AOMG, I went to his show last year at the Showbox in Seattle (I'm from Olympia), my mom is also a fan, so as a Mother's Day present to her I paid for our tickets to Upstream Music Fest and we stayed the day/night in Seattle. The day started off horribly at our hotel (another story), and we decided to head to the festival early to see who else was playing and what else was going on. We heard some great artists, Snarky Puppy, Cosmos to name a few. We enjoyed them and met some great people. We got to the festival about 2 hours before Jay was set to perform so we were happy to wait.

Now comes the time for Jay Park...

First off, I don't mind listening to new music, you never know what you will like. But I do feel like we got a bit duped. I originally thought I was paying for Jay Park, not Jay Park and Friends since he was introducing his label mates from H1gher Music. But okay, I'll roll with it because Jay was so amazing the last time I saw him and it was some mother/daughter time. And really for all I know they will be great and I'll have found new artists to listen to.

So we're waiting for it to start sitting down (I have a hip problem from old swimmers injuries) and then walks by a bunch of people and Jay Park! He walked right by my mother and I, we said hi but that was it. I didn't want to take a photo, he looked incredibly nervous. Another 15 minutes and Cha Cha Malone with Sik K came by too, again we said hi and a few other girls ran over and took photos with them. Right around five minutes before he was set to perform they all came by. He had changed clothes and went on stage. We went towards the back of the group at the main stage to watch, in case I needed to leave to sit down. 

He started off with Aquaman, which he turned into a PG-13 version, it was good and he clearly needed to warm up (he was a little flat, but I appreciate I could tell he was singing live) but he got more comfortable as the song went on and sounded better. He and his dancers were amazing as always. Next he did Me Like Yuh in english, which was great. My mom and I were having a great time, we were surrounded by Jay's crew and his brother since we were at the back. He then introduced some of AOM and they all did some B Boy dancing (so did Cha Cha), then he did All I Wanna Do with Hoody and danced during Loco's part. Let me just say, I do not appreciate Hoody enough! She was AMAZING! She sounded perfect live!

Hoody performed a song, which was actually the best part and my mom was impressed. He then did a song with Raz Simmone, Only One, it was okay. Jay was good and so was Raz, just not my favorite song. Unfortunately we had to leave (my hip was getting really bad) so this is an incomplete record of everything. But the crowd was small, maybe 100 people were there, I could be wrong. But the crowd was small, more people came to the performance at the Showbox a year ago. 

Do I feel like I got my money's worth? No. I don't. The whole festival wasn't great, it was also its first year. 
Would I pay to see Jay Park again? Probably, but only if he properly advertised from the beginning who was with him, instead of feeling like he snuck them in. But my mom and I had a good time together, and that is what mattered.",6,19,False,self,,,,,

more than i used to, i see a lot of talk about line distribution in songs/albums when there's a new release, especially now i see a lot of charts and even videos tracking exactly how much time each member sings for. i didn't really think it was an issue until i realised how common the comments about it, so i wanted to see other people's opinions about what 'fair' distribution is to see some different views. 

personally i don't mind uneven distribution when everyone at least gets a couple lines. it's harder when there's maybe 7+ members and not all are great singers, but i don't like someone getting stuck with 3 words. on the other hand, i wouldn't expect the worst dancer to get more solo/difficult dancing parts, so i don't expect the worst singer to get the same or more parts as everyone else. i see 'fair' being referred to as being each member of an 8 member group getting roughly 1/8 of the lines, is this the most common preference for assigning lines?",25,0,False,self,,,,,

It's by somebody who is Korean who finds it bad that I'm white and I like kpop.  Like I said, I don't see the problem with it but I wanted to know if anybody else sees problem in this situation.

What is your choice?

Hi it's Choa!

I had a long break for the first time since debut. I'm a bit surprised that many people were concerned about it. Thank you very much for thinking about me even when I'm not around ^^ .

I had an agreement with the company since filming the Excuse Me MV back in December 2016 and that was mixed up with rumors of my disappearances. Before taking a break, I wanted to talk with the people who've been waiting for me but I didn't want to announce it as I want to have a personal break.

The manager team suggested to me that I not use SNS during the break.
I
 felt uneasy, but I followed the suggestion.

I feel like I should've explained it more to those who have waited for me, but I was too relaxed. I sincerely apologize to you who've supported and waited for me. Because of the delayed announcement, there are many bad guesses spreading around and it seems to be causing some rumors. I'm just taking a break which was already arranged before, so I hope there will be no more wrong assumptions spread around.

To those who posted baseless opinions! It hurts a lot to those who are concerned, so please delete it.

It is the end of my statement,

Once again I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart to those who have supported me. I will try hard to show you a better appearance.

Thank you.

Well, I'm glad that she clarified things and everything's okay. Hope you enjoy the rest of your break Choa!",56,443,False,self,,,,,

It is easy to feel overwhelmed sometimes because new idol groups are always debuting, and new songs are constantly being released. K-pop agencies sometimes resort to using marketing gimmicks to help their idol groups stand out from the crowd.

In her [recent interview with Kpopalypse](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/65ie0u/interview_kpopalypse_interviews_melanie_lee_from/), ex-ChoColat member Melanie revealed that her former company's boss was obsessed with debuting an all-biracial K-pop girl group. He thought the girls' mixed heritage would drum up hype for their debut. While there was some initial interest in the members' racial backgrounds, it just wasn't enough.

Other marketing gimmicks are meme-worthy or have largely fallen by the wayside. For example, Crayon Pop donned helmets, while the members of AOA were given angel names. Neither of these ploys are used extensively today, but they played a part in differentiating Crayon Pop and AOA from other groups.

**Do you think marketing gimmicks work in K-pop? Have you ever gained interest in a group because of its gimmick? What are some of the lamest or most awful ones?**",39,54,False,self,,,,,

Although I'm super happy for its success, I can't enjoy that song so much. RR is still my favorite from the group.

In case you haven't noticed, the subscriber number over there on your right has gone a bit crazy, and **/r/kpop has now officially surpassed 100,000 subscribers!**  Not only that, but we reached this milestone only five days after hitting 80,000!  Thank you to everyone who makes this a great community!  Whether you contribute, comment, or just lurk, we love having you and sharing our passion for KPOP!  We can't thank you all enough!  If you're one of these new members, welcome!  And don't forget to [read the rules!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules)

#### So What Happened?

For the past few months, our growth has been very steady at just about 100 new subscribers per day, give or take a few.  Then suddenly, on May 10th, that number jumped to **3000 new subscribers**, and it didn't go down!  We've averaged [approximately 3000 new subs every day since May 10th.](http://i.imgur.com/HLZK7uh.jpg)  How can this be possible?  What kind of sajaegi BS is going on?  We didn't know either.  So we sent messages to Reddit's admins to try and find out what was happening.  Are these users real?  Are they bots?  The answer that we got was unexpected.  Yes, the users are real and they are coming from a new ""onboarding"" process in the Reddit mobile app.  When someone creates a new Reddit account in the official mobile app, they are now asked to pick several categories that interest them, then they are subscribed to several subreddits based on those preferences.  Well, /r/kpop is listed under the Music category!  That means that anyone who selects Music as an interest automatically gets sub'd to /r/kpop, making us kind of a pseudo-default subreddit!  Needless to say, this is HUGE!

#### Great! Now What?

This means that we have a lot of new subscribers who are new to KPOP or may not even like KPOP. 
 Because of that, we need to be extra helpful to users who have questions.  This is a great chance to expose a lot of people to the wonderful world of KPOP!  Use that chance to spread the love!  It also means that unless we get removed from the Music group, we can expect this growth to continue indefinitely.  At the current pace, we will gain approximately **100,000 new subs per month!**  It took us 8 years to hit 100k and now we expect to hit 200k by the end of June!  Plus, this onboarding process could eventually come to the desktop website which would see another huge spike in subs.  If this continues, it is not unreasonable to project that **we may hit 1 MILLION SUBS by the end of 2017!**  So basically, hold onto your butts!  [This party is just getting started!](https://youtu.be/HQzu7NYlZNQ?t=18)

As a long time Jiyoon/4minute fan I had to go even if it was going to be really terrible (I had no idea what she would do/how it would be) so I made plans to go/drag my aunt with me (since she would be walking around with me at the time)

The concert ended up way better than I expected, so I figured I'd post about it to drive others to her concert next time she has one... I went to the 3pm show on Saturday and I expected it to be sold out by the time we got there, but it was surprisingly empty. Probably 45 people max in the venue, which was kind of sad, and she mentioned more people showed up than Friday (despite it being super rainy) which was even more sad. The show was so good and there were so few people that I decided I was going to go again at 8, when luckily more people showed up.

Now for the concert itself:
From what I can remember she performed:

I do

Magnet

Cliche

This Ain't Me

BoA - [Moon and Sunrise](https://youtu.be/wyHbrLm7Bco)

Iggy Izelia - Fancy

Elle Varner - I Only Wanna Give it to You

Ariana Grande - Best Mistake

I expected my favorite of the night would be Magnet (as I listen to it the most) but I ended up liking This Ain't Me the best, mostly because of the energy and fan interactions. She tried to get my aunt to sing the ""this is, this is"" part at one point, but she had no idea what the lyrics were so she moved the mic to me and I got to sing in the first show. I actually liked the second she even better where she tried to get a bunch of Japanese people to sing ""   "" to varying degrees of success. It was pretty funny and she looked like she was having a lot of fun with it. In fact the only part that I wasn't completely amazed by was Magnet (she did part of the dance instead of singing the guy's rap part, which I'd have liked her to do. Not that I can stay mad about the butt shake dance)

The show ended up running for ~90 minutes, which included a Q/A session where she answered pre-written fan questions, a handwritten letter reading,  and also played a really fun take on Rock Paper Scissors where she throws and then within .5 seconds you have to [throw the losing one](https://youtu.be/ffKOpNsTR8Y). If she wins you get a signed cliche CD. It was surprisingly difficult to purposely lose. (at least for me, I went to throw the winning one on accident both times, then panicked) above is a poorly filmed clip of it.

The fan questions were also surprisingly good with few exceptions. 3 people in the first concert asked what her favorite Japanese food was (the 2nd and 3rd time she read the question she jokingly pretended to pause and really consider it before answering the same thing, which kind of saved the awkwardness) but a couple of people at the 8pm concert had some questions that had me like ""for real!?"" From what I can remember there was a ""where's Gayoon?"" a ""what did you think of 4minute?"" and a ""why don't you perform 4minute songs?"" (the last one someone asked here and the answer was ""because there's be giant holes without any of the members there"" (she didn't even do most of her duo songs)",8,86,False,self,,,,,

As a big fan of hip hop, I find it's a genre that many people could and do call trash, specifically trash musically. The biggest criticisms it tends to receive come in the form of  ""It's just some black dudes talking fast about having cars, money n hoes bro"". 

Throughout the years however, enough pieces of quality music with real artistic value have been released within the genre, pieces such as [Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly](https://youtu.be/qTmHuavOXNg) or [2Pac's 2Pacalypse now](https://youtu.be/S6s_0vTF1Bk) that if anyone were to actually say that, I could point them to these albums and tell them that Rap has legitimate arguments to defend itself that prove it's a musical style deserving of respect.

With regards to K-POP, it has been said that it is one of the only branches of music were music isn't the main focus, which could be argued is true. However do you personally believe that, like rap, K-Pop can stand up for itself as a legitimate form of music, art and expression, or are we just part of some mass scale commercial project devoid of any soul? Do you think it actually matters is all of this unnecessary for a genre many people adore and makes them happier?

I'd love to know.",34,23,False,self,,,,,

Since KNK are coming back on the 25th with *GRAVITY*, we as mods of /r/kNk decided to move over to /r/keunakeun

####Why are you moving to /r/keunakeun?

/r/KNK is capitalized as /r/kNk, so we used CSS to change everything within the subreddit to KNK but there's not much to be done for the URL. I messaged the mod of /r/keunakeun a few months ago to see if a merge was possible since it was private the whole time and I got a response in about February. So we waited when a comeback was near to announce our move

For those that don't know, KNK is five-member boy group under YNB Entertainment that debuted on March 3, 2016 with [Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYVDIZcb6Og) and had 2 subsequent comebacks with [Back Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp34Lfv3OLc) and [U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8sfxDj9OJ4). They will also be releasing a MV teaser within a few hours for their new title track *,, (Sun, Moon, Star)*.

Firstly we are AkMuTeam Vietnam from Akdong Musician Vietnam Fanpage (AMVF). By chance Vietnamese fans discovered a Vietnamese OST which uses 100% of the beat from the song  Give love - Akdong Musician which was released in album PLAY (2014) without credit and permission. Moreover, this plagiarizing song was also used for commercial purposes such as using in webdrama ( many episodes) and in an online dance game (Audition Vietnam), selling online and many more. We - Akdong Musician's Vietnamese Fans think that it violates the Copyright Law. Please take a look at the video from the link below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUFkFRLFcwk 

The admin of AMVF has contacted with Bc Xu TV (the Youtube Chanel that uploaded the video) and has received a reply from them that they just did a cover of the song. After being reminded, they have changed the descriptions and the title of the video. However, seeing that they are using this song for business purposes, Vietnamese fans know that Bc Xu TV were trying to cover all the wrong things that they had done. 

**We know that we have to take actions now and we need your help and support to prevent the plagiarism. Please spread this news to all the Kpop fans and please take action with us by reporting that video with Youtube and YG Entertainment.** 

Please click on the pictures to see more information, evidences and the translation for every picture.

Sincerely,

AkMuTeam Vietnam.

i just love SM's album covers so much that i could post all 5 of them here but i tried not to, i'll try to keep mine varied as possible.

edit: wow i just got back and some of you guys describe the album covers really well, as an op i feel bad for leaving the links without describe about how i really feel and why i like them lol ok im gonna make an attempt despite my terrible english i hope you will get the gist of it, so here we go:

the album cover screams ""SUMMER!"" for me, yes thats what you're gonna get an album full of dance and uplifting songs that will make you smile like an idiot the whole time you listen to them. This album never failed to uplift my mood whenever i have a shitty day just like their bright, colorful and playful front cover, the tracks in the album are just as the same as the cover potrays, thank you B.A.P!!!

This is one of those covers that ""you dont know who the hell the singer is but makes you want to listen to the whole album"" moment. This was when they were still a nugu, i was browsing a site and i liked the cover the first time i looked at it. It looks soothing and you can feel the breeze flowing through the cover, makes me feel sentimental so i decided to take a listen to the album and liked it.

[Ninaian - For A Little Cruise](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/770x0/8b55f8e6df7b45b089ae6c0585013c06.jpg)

This album is a shoegaze/post-rock masterpiece im so glad i discovered it. The tracks in the album sound hauntingly beautiful which matched this sorrowful and greenly depressive cover. Sometimes i'd stare at the cover while i listen to the album.

[Red Velvet - Russian Roulette](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/770x0/a362547fcd2a14d93f6b023391a5c139.jpg)

I love the aesthetic, SM is really good at designing cover in the recent years. This cover looks creepy and somewhat cute at the same time. I disliked the [main cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Russian_Roulette%2C_Red_Velvet_album.png) of this album, as soon as i found out they have an alt cover (which is the cover i post above) i changed to it right away.

With how successful BTS is, they have enough resources to promote BTS to their full extent and beyond, all while debuting a new group.

'Idol School' is the first Korean girl group education institute established by Mnet. Entrants to the ""Idol School"" will complete the 11-week full-time course, and the best students who pass the graduation exam will immediately make their debut as a girl group at the same time as graduating in the second half of 2017. 

Kim Hee-chul, who was appointed as a teacher of 'Idol School', will give realistic experience to the students as a member of veteran idol group Super Junior who will be in the thirteenth year of his debut this year. Kim Hee-chul is expected to play a pivotal role as a teacher of the 'Idol School' who has a special point to the girl group and nurtures a new girl group. 

Kim Hee-chul, takes on the role of guardian, director, and dream supporter of students with practical tips to grow into an idol. It is expected to be a real running mate of students who set their career paths as idol. 

Kim Hee-chul, who was appointed as a teacher at the 'Idol School', said, ""I will be a true supporter with a mother's mindset in guiding students to the right path."" 

The crew of the 'Idol School' said, ""I am expecting the role of a homeroom teacher, sometimes a friend, and a senior who can rely on realistic experiences from inside and outside the stage.
I hope Kim Hee-chul will be a spiritual support for students who are not evaluators.""

On the other hand, 'Idol School' is scheduled to be aired in July as an idol training project. Participants will take a systematic curriculum for 11 weeks. In order to minimize the time it takes to start from the trainee to the debut, the vocals and dances of the Korean idol group will be joined by actual staff members to conduct ""short-term focused and customized classes"".

Description from [MelOn](http://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=10064541):

&gt; The mini-album [Foreigner] is for all the outsiders, whether in your own community or another. As an Asian-American a.k.a. - 'gyopo' I never knew where I belonged. I had two identities, neither one being fully accepting. Even when I visited Korea my home country I felt like a ""foreigner"", not fully understanding the language but still I had people who had followed my music and embraced me. In the current world so divided, its hard for anyone to feel like they belong anywhere. This mini-album is my first project ever distributed in Korea and I wanted to flip the word ""Foreigner"" (which is used in a negative way usually) into something positive. This mini-album is one of three total mini-albums that will be released in 2017.

The filming is in progress. 

According to the broadcasting station on May 24, Jung Hyung Don and Song Min Ho are filming in the Dongtan area in Gyeonggi province from this afternoon. They will go along with Lee Kyung-kyu and Kang Ho-dong to meet local residents and ask for a warm meal. 

The combination of guests is rather surprising, since there is no connection between Jung Hyung Don and Song Minho. However, expectations are high because of the influential guests.

* are in YG ent, which kinda guarantees you a moderate popularity from just the label name

* have been exposed to the public since 2013 with survival programs 'WIN: Who Is Next' and 'Mix &amp; Match'

* have gained lots of popularity through solo activities as well, (SMTM 3, Bobby and B.I featuring in number of songs)

* Just a solid group in general, with powerhouse rappers/vocals/dancers


 I am REALLY surprised at how quick they have fallen from the charts, after only 2 days since release. Their new songs werent even that bad, I was definitely jamming to them and the response was generally positive (at least better than Signal). I'm Korean, but I still don't get why they aren't doing at least half-decently as Winner or other YG artists. I dont know WHAT is the problem with IKON right now, is it YG's fault for not promoting them enough? Or am I just fan-blind and they are actually just bad..",104,67,False,self,,,,,

BTS - Rap Monster's [bell boy?](http://k-popped.com/kpopped2012/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BTS-Rap-Monster-Dope-Sick-2.jpg) outfit in Dope. It's just so memorable to me.

Got7 - Jackson's [striped suit](https://i2.wp.com/33.media.tumblr.com/0d90c41ee87b6350bb6bbf9519b6ee64/tumblr_nv19hdT95l1toro8yo3_400.gif) in If You Do. The boy needs to wear more suits I swear.

Monsta X - Jooheon's [pinned jacket](http://pa1.narvii.com/6409/278d71b36b70094ced3aa44dc76fc69e988d57b5_hq.gif) in Beautiful. I also liked his long jacket with the tigers on it but I can't seem to find a picture that shows it off well.

iKON/WINNER - Bobby and Mino are both my bias in their respective groups so I choose the [black suits](http://68.media.tumblr.com/edc909ac987bb5b819363165696eb0d0/tumblr_od712haP641r76b9fo4_540.gif) they wore in Full House. Classic.

Block B - Zico all [tatted up with a black fur coat](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RAQRa_TY95w/UkwDl5mCIyI/AAAAAAAAHAo/Zwbc3L9h6zk/s1600/block_b_very_good_zico_2.jpg) in Very Good. Idk about y'all but I love seeing Zico look like a mad man. Lol 

Big Bang - Taeyang's [metal arm piece](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d5/98/50/d598504344759803f3688b7ccad0a00f.gif) in Fantastic Baby. I actually want to recreate that arm piece because it's just so cool looking.

EXO - Lastly, Sehun's [long white coat](http://68.media.tumblr.com/d17db85e2382ffca67e0083c03d384ec/tumblr_nr08554YSh1u5i897o6_250.gif) in Overdose.

- How much do these things usually cost? I'm guessing around $100 AUD??
- Can you get merch such as light sticks at the venue or is that an official fan club member thing? 
- Any G-Dragon fans in Perth who'd be interested in making a trip out of it with me? I've been checking out flights and they're pretty cheap at the moment, like $240 return...

I got to the park around 9 am and there was already a line for everyone waiting. The ticket office wasn't opening until noon so everyone was just chilling. We heard Red Velvet's rehearsal and I kept sitting down. After a while we heard NCT do their intro and we all ran towards these stairs to watch the rehearsal. We were doing the fanchants. Yeah. Hi. That's us. They rehearsed Firetruck, Once Again, Good Thing, and Limitless. So the usual songs. 

After that we went back to sitting until they told us to  line up from where we bought tickets or if we already have tickets to wait in the line for wristbands. So we sprinted again. After my friend and I got our wristbands we went and waited to go into the venue for another hour. 

After we got in, we waited for a long time. Both of the first two DJs were really good. After the second set Dindin came on. He was hilarious. He was interacting with the crowd and was really animated. He told us what he wanted the crowd to sing for him and then explained it in English for the foreigners. His response after we all went ""woah"" was great. I'm from Canada. He brought out his producer friend to help with two songs. He also was drinking beer and we kept screaming. 

After Dindin was Red Velvet and ahhhhhhh!!!!! Irene wasn't there because she was sick. Joy was super close to me and I got a few pictures. But Wendy. Ahhh Wendy!!!! This goddess!!!! I love her so much. I have no shame about that. But Joy!!!! She's so cute. Security was cracking down on fansites and one guard even jumped over to stop her from taking pictures. It was ridiculous. 

After Red Velvet was another dj combination and this was when the crowd started to push. And they wouldn't stop pushing. When the boys came out I basically was pushed up against a girl who was pushed up against a fansite. There was no winners with this. I felt like I was in a sea of Cassies and EXO-Ls combined. They played Mr. Brightside and I was singing it so loud people were looking at me. Hey. I'm an American. This song is a national anthem back home. 

The boys came out and did Firetruck and boy the fanchants. I'm never gonna get sick of that song since it's 127's debut song but can we please just get an OT9 version one day??? Doyoung and Johnny were backstage and we could see them dancing around. They were out of breathe after it. I could hear them panting for breath. 

After Firetruck was Once Again and it's another classic. After the finished that, Johnny and Doyoung joined to do the introduction. Of course I screamed for all of them, but especially for  Johnny. I held my sign up high before I was hit by someone to put it down. Aish. 

Good Thing is such a good song and Johnny's one very short line gets me every time. Please SM give him, Yuta, and Winwin more lines. Before the song started, Taeyong took off his hat to fix his hair. He's out to destroy your bias lists for this comeback. 

After they finished Good Thing, they said a few more words and said it was their last song. Aka Limitless. Fanchants once again on point while everyone is being pushed around. That song. It makes me emotional for many reasons. Maybe because it was the first song that Johnny was part of in the group. Maybe it's because it's the song that made me realize that NCT is my UB group. Who really knows??? They finished Limitless and waved to us as they left.

Right after they left, Hyuna came on. A lot of people were trying to leave but couldn't. My friend and I were able to leave before she started her third song. The front was where people kept pushing but the back was very understanding. Oh these people are leaving. Let's clear a path. 

I'm low key glad that all the boys wore something over their arms cause I was not ready to see any of them sleeveless. I wasn't really able to focus on each member individually All of them looked so good. Haechan is growing! He's gonna be as tall as Johnny. Maybe even taller. Mark looked so good. And Taeyong. Gah. Why am I always so drawn to him??? But Johnny. Oh Johnny. Oh, oh Johnny. Words cannot even explain what I feel when I see him. 

It's been 4 months since I last saw them perform and I am so happy. I am so ready for this comeback to happen. But first, I have Dream Concert with both 127 and Dream!

It's why I sometimes tend to love sometimes more compositionally experimental tunes like Twice's [Signal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQtonf1fv_s) -- but I don't necessarily think that song is the best example. I'd say the ultimate example is when [Tiffany really takes us there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E#t=2m00s) in Girls' Generation's ""I Got A Boy"". 





I actually very much disliked this somewhat commonplace style of mid-song genre switch when I first got into kpop. Down the line, I grew to love it. I think it was probably SHINee's [Lucifer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dww9UjJ4Dt8) that did the trick - although one could argue that it doesn't switch genres, it feels disjointed and goes to a lot of different sonic places, pretty spastically.

Here's a couple that I've noticed recently:

**Mixing HQ and LQ video** -- I'm seeing more videos where shots will go from very clear high quality video to 'VHS quality', with deliberate noise or video corruption. Some examples include [NCT's Limitless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW8iyJcmve4) and [GOT7's My Swagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMDfR_PJ7ss). Also related, **90's fashion** is lowkey making a comeback in kpop, so this stylistic choice is probably also used to evoke a 90s VHS tape.

**Individual shots in wildly different environments** -- Basically, a very large portion of the video will be focused on individual shots, where each member is in a completely different set than the last member. This is a trend I'm especially noticing in girl group MVs. I think this technique helps in establishing individual 'personalities' for each member, and a viewer is more able to remember someone if they remember their respective set/environment. Most famous example are TWICE's [Cheer Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7rCyll5AeY) (though most of their vids use this), other examples include [Pristin's Wee Woo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLfHuClrQdI) and [Gugudan's A Girl Like Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQxtwvLUByM).

This could be long, but it's just what I think of everything.

**The ""Big 3""**

* [Allkpop](http://www.allkpop.com/) - Undoubtedly still the largest, they also come with the worst reputation of the ""Big 3"". They are generally the fastest when it comes to ""minor"" stories such as what idols did on TV Show that could interest their fans who aren't able to follow them 24/7 (think idols telling stories on Radio or Varieties). They are also very well known for having click-bait titles and carrying mis-translated works. They've also taken a big hit with the removal of their forums, and also the Ailee scandal. Allkpop also doesn't necessarily take into account the reader's visual senses when writing articles, sometimes leaving them either very short or adding pictures that are very small or low quality.

* [Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/) - Personally I think Soompi is the best of the ""Big 3"". Their articles are almost always translated correctly and they are generally up to date with content. Their articles end up being very text based, which could turn some people away but personally I don't feel like that's a problem. Other people might think so though. Their website imo, is the worst of the ""Big 3"". It's much more difficult for the average reader to look through all of their headlines to see what they want to read, compared to Allkpop or Koreaboo.

* [Koreaboo](http://www.koreaboo.com/) - Koreaboo's made a lot of changes recently, namely to their website layout and their new article style. Recently, they've been the fastest of the Big 3 to break some of the biggest news (Kim Woo Bin's cancer, Sistar's disbandment, Kim Tae Hee and Rain's child, to name a few.) which makes me think they've also discovered a new article writing system? Either way, the drawback with Koreaboo is that sometimes they're late on article topics (think over 36 hours since the event happened) and that some of their articles don't have anything to do with Korean culture at all. They've also had issues with mis-translations, similar to Allkpop.

**Fan-Submitted**

* OneHallyu - [Can't actually link the site] OneHallyu's Korean Celebrity News &amp; Gossip section can be a great place to keep track of news. However, it is all fan submitted, but the users generally will submit at least the source link. Debatable if it's 100% useful, since most of the content comes from Twitter anyway. Usually won't have a translation attached with it. It's a good place if you want to see the reaction of English speaking fans though. They can get very... emotional about their artists. Largest active international K-Pop forum by far.

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/) - Hello Reddit. Casual fans will like Reddit since it usually isn't filled with all of the fluff that the major sites add. The addition of the new rule of requiring at least a summary of the major points of the article helps the reader understand what's going on. Not exactly suited for hardcore stans who want to know everything about their favorite artist.

* [Omonatheydidnt](http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/) - Another fan submitted section. Nothing really too big honestly. They have their own userbase.

**Twitter**

* [OH_mes](https://twitter.com/OH_mes) - myself heh. I dunno why I started spamming out news tweets to be honest, but I guess people liked them enough to follow me. Anyway, I just try to get whatever I find interesting out for people to see, hence you'll sometimes see drama, non-K-Pop (ballad, R&amp;B, etc.) and even Korean politics come from me. If necessary (which is usually always), I'll add multiple tweets of follow-up and also mention whether the agency has confirmed or denied anything that was an insider report. I'd also like to think I'm pretty quick at this stuff (LOL) and that fans will definitely find things out faster from myself or another Twitter source than from a newsite like the Big 3. This is definitely not a self-promotion.

* [/u/Balloon_wanted](https://twitter.com/balloon_wanted) - B_W is much more well known on Reddit but did you know they've got a Twitter too? Generally B_W posts on Reddit first (from what I've seen) and then will upload a picture of their article summary to Twitter. But B_W is still a good source for information, when they're posting articles xD

* [Girlgroupzone](https://twitter.com/girlgroupzone) - GGZ is usually really quick with anything girl group related. My only issue with them is that they never add a source, which (personally), casts a slight shadow of doubt. But they've been around for so long that everyone (including myself) knows that their stuff is based off an article.

* [TheSeoulStory](https://twitter.com/theseoulstory) - Another big Twitter source, TSS posts mainly news about bigger groups. They do it quick too. Good stuff.

Other

* [Netizenbuzz](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/) (and similar sites) - Never a place where you will find the breaking news. Instead, on NB and other netizen comment sites, you'll see all the Korean's reactions to some of the biggest events around. NB tends to lean towards the negative comments (uses Nate more often than Naver) but she'll still use Naver comments (which are generally 5-10x more) in some of the biggest news. They're interesting reads if anything.

* [Asianjunkie](http://www.asianjunkie.com/) - Opinionated but interesting reads. AJ covers some of the smaller events that other sites may not think are worth covering. Also I like some of their article titles.

We've had a lot of new subscribers recently and I thought it would be nice to work as a community to create a playlist to link to newcomers easily where they can just shuffle it, and do a spin on the many 'favourite' song questions.  
  
It can also work for other listeners of kpop where you can just shuffle the playlist and be surprised what songs you come across. 
  
What I'd like you each to do, is choose **your one favourite song**. Not two, not three. Just your one favourite song.  
  
I'll then compile it into a YT playlist in a few days and a Spotify playlist minus the region locked songs.  
  
Let's begin!

Part of the reason was because my school had a high Asian population, so all of the other girls where into it. I was also really into Japanese stuff at the time so I thought Japanese music was superior to Kpop. And I wasn't that into the MV and fashion styles that was popular circa 2009. But after being constantly surrounded by people who adore kpop it eventually wore me down. While I resisted, I occasionally indulged myself by listening to a song or two from Big Bang or Ailee. Before I knew it, I started watching Korean variety shows and this lead to me being more open to listening to more kpop. So long story short, I'm kind of obsessed now and I spend way too much time thinking about kpop. ",40,40,False,self,,,,,

Someone hosted a live audio stream on Mixlr.

[The opening video for SISTAR was a compilation of their wins over the years](https://twitter.com/kkkkkching/status/868801153500192771).

[SISTAR revealed their last single will contain 2 songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV9hLWFww7U). Their title track Lonely and their fan song.

Soyou sounded like she was choking up or crying at one point.

MooMoo's stayed until the very end of the concert even though MAMAMOO had already left. [They even turned their lightsticks to pink when SISTAR was performing](https://twitter.com/HyolynUpdates/status/868770352008056833). They were chanting ""SISTAR saranghae"" at one point. 

KSTAR1's created some [4,500 slogans](http://imgur.com/a/6UWzU) saying [""I'll remember you SISTAR.""](https://twitter.com/HyolynUpdates/status/868741126664077312) Starship discontinued official lightsticks and cheer towels.

On V-LIVE afterwards, MAMAMOO was [jamming out](https://twitter.com/comaniie/status/868770033584951296) to [SISTAR](https://twitter.com/2younggirls/status/868783812829786112).

[FXXK IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIPH8LFYFRk) and [Not Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DwzBICPhdM) helped me get some negative feelings out and tell my anxiety it wouldn't win today. Then, [Are You Hungry?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKcUadgT4qM) and [Blue Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeJAee3m3Ik) helped me come down cause both are fun, upbeat songs. 

For non K-Pop, [Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIi57zhDl78)) and [The Illest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxpMk3pvz44) help because they have such a dirty beat that when I am blasting the bass in my car I can block out the negative thoughts.

In the past couple of days I've been working on a massive timeline of 2nd generation girl groups. In the wake of Sistar's disbandment, plus more girl groups going inactive and disbanding, I wanted to see what, chronologically, all this actually looks like. Originally it was going to be simple, but one thing led to another and, lo and behold, multiple timelines, charts, and other various things were made!

A couple of things:

* _Defining 2nd Gen Girl Group._ For the purposes of this discussion and/or timeline, a 2nd gen girl group is considered a group that debuted from 2006^1 up to 2010. So, for the purposes of this timeline, any girl group that debuted from Brown Eyed Girls to miss A is considered a second gen group.

* _A note on ""classic"" or ""popular"" songs:_ these terms are entirely subjective. Again, SUBJECTIVE. Some are pretty obvious (i.e. Nobody, Gee), but some are more disputable. Please do not feel offended if I didn't choose a song that's a ""classic"" or if you think I designated a song ""popular"" when you don't feel like it was. These were entirely my choices, and obviously while I can try to be objective, I'm only one person; of course there will be some subjectivity to my choices.

* _On the timeline itself:_ Please keep in mind that it's not entirely comprehensive. I made this because I was interested in 2nd gen girl groups, not because I know every single thing about them. I don't pretend to know everything about all of them. This was based on my own searches, knowledge, and interpretation of events. Please do not be upset if I did not include something in this timeline; this timeline is already wayyyyy too big as it is and it's not going to serve anyone any good if I keep making it bigger.

*Disclaimer:* __THIS TIMELINE DOES NOT COVER JAPANESE RELEASES.__ Too many groups have released too many Japanese albums. I was going to try to, but after seeing how massive KARA's is, I decided I don't want to do that. It would've been too cumbersome to put every single Japanese release in here. So, for this timeline, it only considers Korean releases/achievements, and some American achievements. 

All that said, here it is! [The very large timeline of 2nd generation girl groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h1Fy_rXHSfYa6AZKYPwNyEjQJSdKwcMofWlDg6TfMjI/edit#gid=0), from 2006 to present. (Note: this is best viewed on your computer, on your phone this will be very hard to understand)

If you're also curious about other things, here's some more data, timelines, and charts!

Here's the [masterpost](https://kpopfoodforthought.tumblr.com/post/161211937290/in-case-you-cant-see-the-graphs-charts-or) with all the aforementioned charts, timelines, and links, for your viewing. If you wanna read how I did it/analyses, it's in the links below:

* [Overall Timeline of Activity of 2nd Gen Girl Groups](http://i.imgur.com/BhxrP1A.png), and some [proposed alternative timelines](https://kpopfoodforthought.tumblr.com/post/161211610155/what-will-happen-to-the-2nd-generation-of-girl) (this some Doctor Who kinda shit)
* [A Timeline Just for the Year 2016](http://i.imgur.com/G6Nnu1m.jpg), and [my own take on that](https://kpopfoodforthought.tumblr.com/post/161211613090/year-2016-the-critical-hit)
* Update: [Physical album sales](https://kpopfoodforthought.tumblr.com/post/161213860130/update-album-sales-corrected-for-to-include) to include SNSD's sales for Party
* Update: If you're interested in all the numbers, [here they are](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14VW6o4c-APS-uuHoEk-VKvBcBrmjbjMmTUpg4QFKEnA/edit?usp=sharing)

So, yeah, that's everything! I hope you enjoy going through the timeline, I hope you enjoy all the graphs/charts/other timelines, and I hope this was something that interested you along the way! Thanks for reading everything. Hope you enjoy!

&gt; According to a number of broadcasters, Seventeen will be filming for MBC Every1 Weekly Idol on May 31. It will be aired mid-June. 

&gt; Seventeen has been concentrating on music broadcasts since their comeback on May 22. After ten days of comeback week, Seventeen will appear for the first time alone on Weekly Idol.

&gt; Seventeen will be back on Weekly Idol after about a year and seven months since their last appearance in October 2015. They appeared as rookies at the time, but is now returning to Weekly idol because of their position as a major group. 

&gt; Seventeen, who has been popular since debut, have appeared in MBC 'My Little TV' and MBC music 'One Fine Day for Seventeen'. This is why anticipation is high for their free-spirited performance that Seventeen will show in ""Weekly Idol.""

Happy guessing!

Edit: This has been so fun! Looks like the comments are slowing down so might as well reveal my top 5. (I'm on mobile, no links. Sorry!)

1. BTS - They were doing a behind the scenes video for a photoshoot. J-Hope told a pretty bad joke and V looked at him sternly, saying ""Do you still want my respect?"" 

2. SNSD - They've a habit of doing this! Lol during press events a reporter would go up to a member to answer questions and the member would naturally point to another member, directing the reporter to ask the other members instead. They are hilarious.

3. EXO - Baekhyun's famous ""Kkaebsong"" quote. It was especially emphasized during their Exo Showtime! Broadcast. 

4. f(x) - Krystal saying this to Amber when Amber kept on annoying her with the ""What are you doing?"" question. 

5. Monsta X - Monsta X played this game with BTOB (also a top group from me) on their show X-Ray (Episode 4) where they have to sing this song from low to high pitch. Song goes: ""Hi, Cleopatra. The world's best potato chips."" Hilarity ensues, and I think this was definitely the video that made me fall hard for these idiots. ",293,65,False,self,,,,,

Like how chocolat just pretty much disappeared from the scene, what are they doing now? And other groups or soloists. 
But what I also want to know is if companies recycle idols. Like if there was a group that disbanded, do any of them get put into a new group or anything? Or would idols that failed with another company after a debut, however long after (months to years after), would they go be able to a new company and debut with another group?
I've never heard of any of the happening, the most I hear is that they go solo if they were in a group,or live a normal life or something, but I also dont really pay much attention to that stuff unless its groups I've followed for a while.

I was a kpop fan back when Super Junior, SNSD, Big Bang, 2NE1, and SHINee were the main focus. I wasn't too into it then at first but I loved the music. Then the second half of highschool came rolling in and I just became so busy that I just stopped paying attention to the kpop scene. College was no different too. So now I just recently got back on to the scene. During my 3rd year of college (basically 3 months ago lol), I was looking on twitter and I saw 'NOT TODAY' trending. I clicked it and saw all these fans freaking out over this MV that BTS just dropped (and how Jin barely got any screen time lol). Now see, I was aware of BTS even during my break and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Basically the song blew my mind. Made me wonder what the hell I've been missing. Looked up videos of ""Kpop hits of (insert years I missed here)"". Discovered more groups and now i'm more into kpop than I was when I first started. The talent is real y'all.

Tl;dr - Long time kpop fan. Took a huge break. BTS got me back in the game. Now I'm more obsessed than I was.",48,64,False,self,,,,,
