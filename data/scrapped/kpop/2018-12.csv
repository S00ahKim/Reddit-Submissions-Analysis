The Town Hall is an opportunity for the mods to make announcements and propose changes, while also getting feedback from you guys about those changes and the current state of the subreddit.  Please feel free to comment about any issues that have been bothering you, and provide any suggestions you may have to make r/kpop a more enjoyable place.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Toxic Environment

[Last Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9bznvb/town_hall_september_2018/) we discussed hostile comments and the steps that mods would take to limit and fight against them.  We have been hard at work removing hostile comments as well as handing out warnings and bans.  However, we still have issues in threads that we need to discuss and try to correct.

One thing we've noticed is that ""anti-anti"" comments are becoming more common.  This is when a few negative comments or downvotes prompts a user to post a long and passionate rebuke against the ""haters"", and makes it seem like the world, or at least the subreddit, is against their favs.  They usually get a lot of upvotes, are pushed to the top, and completely derail the discussion thread.  These comments are just as toxic, if not more so, than the negative ones.  It also invites more ""haters"" to enter the thread and argue about the topic.  Instead of discussing the artist or the music, the entire thread becomes a meta-discussion about antis and hate which is toxic in itself.

If someone posts hateful comments, just downvote and report them.  Mods will remove the comment.  If you believe a user is a troll who's just out to argue and be toxic, please send us a modmail.  We'll review the situation and ban them if necessary.  The worst thing you can do is engage or ""call them out"".  All that does is breed more hostility and derail the discussion thread.  Remember, criticism and expressing dislike is not hateful.  Do not downvote or report users just because you disagree with them or don't like their opinion.  That just creates noise and makes it more difficult for us to weed out the actual problem users.

We will continue to fight against hostile comments and fanwars.  If you're here to argue with fans of a group you don't like, leave or get banned.  That's not the purpose of r/kpop.  If you think some fans need to be ""called out"" for whatever reason, just shut up.  Go call them out on Twitter or some other forum.  You aren't welcome here.  Our subreddit is a place where fans of all groups can come together to enjoy what we love about K-Pop. Please help us keep it that way.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Locking Removed Threads

Starting immediately, mods will begin locking all threads that are removed both by human mods and automod.  All appeals or questions about a mod action need to be sent to Modmail.  You will no longer be able to reply to the removal reason, and we will no longer discuss moderation decisions in comment threads.  We are making this change to ensure that your appeals and questions are answered more quickly and thoughtfully.  Oftentimes, a mod is pulled away or goes to sleep and doesn't see your reply to a removal reason for several hours and other mods are unaware.  Directing all appeals and questions about mod decisions to Modmail will ensure that multiple mods see it more quickly and can act more quickly.

This change has a couple of side-effects both good and bad.  On the good side, it will stop toxic comment chains in threads that have been removed.  On the bad side, it will also halt any remaining good discussion in the thread by users who were there before it was removed.  This is unfortunate, but we feel the positive effects of this change outweigh the drawbacks.

&amp;nbsp;

#### Movie Trailers

Under the [Content Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_content_rules), one of the post types forbidden on r/kpop is ""webshorts, television, and movie clips containing idols"".  Should there be an exception to this rule for official movie trailers?  LOTS of idols and former idols appear in movies, so we don't want to open the floodgates to every small clip they might appear in.  However, if they are a star and appear in the official trailer, maybe that should be allowed?  We're not sure exactly how many posts fit this criteria, but it could be a significant number.  Do you want to see official movie trailers containing idols on r/kpop, or should they stay in the group subs?


&amp;nbsp;

#### Records and Accomplishments

Are there too many records and accomplishment threads?  Do you like seeing threads about breaking a record for most wins in X time, or being number one on the most country iTunes charts, or number of unique listeners, or whatever other somewhat obscure record might be broken next?  Should we limit records to sales and YouTube views only or some other limit?  Let us know how you feel about these posts in the comments below.

&amp;nbsp;

#### YouTube Premiere

YouTube has a new feature that allows channel owners to put up a countdown before their video goes live.  This allows them to spread the link several hours before the actual release to build hype and make its way through social media.  For r/kpop, these links fall under our rules for ""Jumping the Gun"".  Please do not submit countdown links, or any MV links, until the video is actually live and viewable for all users.  Links submitted early will be removed.

&amp;nbsp;

#### New Business

Now is your chance to post any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop.  How do you like things lately?  Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  Any changes you want to see?  The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",387,1,False,self,,,,,

It was my first ever concert, and thus of course, my first time meeting/seeing any kpop idols!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to the generosity of a lovely redditor, I was able to get a ""Higher Choice"" and VIP ticket. The ""Higher Choice"" part included a q&amp;a session, signing, photo with the boys, and merch; the VIP ticket let me stand really close to the stage (literally right next to the barrier on the left side) and got me into the hi-touch.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with the ""Higher Choice"" part since it happened first! There were maybe 20-25 people in the room, so it was quite intimate. Each person took turns asking one question and A.C.E. answered. They had a translator present, but the boys made a really effort to answer in English when they could (especially for short/silly questions). BK seemed to often understand what was being asked before it was translated and spoke the most English. ...actually I think he just spoke the most in general, but I wasn't complaining at all since he's my bias! Chan and Jun spoke second most in general, both making an effort to speak in English when possible. I can't get Chan's ""I'M BAD BOY"" out of my head, haha. Wow and Donghun were the quietest, especially Donghun. I will say I believe it was Donghun who said that if he could pick a fandom colour for Choice, he would pick a rainbow--and then today A.C.E. posted a picture of a rainbow in S.F. since it rained last night, which I thought was really cute! 

&amp;#x200B;

In general, during the q&amp;a, I thought the boys had great chemistry with each other (i.e. seemed to really enjoy laughing/messing around with each other), and seemed just generally happy to be there. I'm sure they were exhausted since they're already halfway through the tour. BK/Jun kept apologizing when they sang little bits saying they had just woke up and it was still early for them, and at one BK said (in English): ""we just got up three years ago"" and then facepalmed and was like ""wait no no, hours!"" It was really cute, and I honestly thought they all sound pretty darn good randomly singing bits of songs even if they weren't vocally warmed up. Random aside, BK has this kinda aggressive way of saying ""ok!"" even when he's not trying to, I've noticed it with a couple of other kpop idols (in videos I've seen). Not sure why it comes out that way. It's cute on BK though (\_I'm biased\_, ok?)

&amp;#x200B;

In general, fans asked pretty respectful/interesting questions. There were a couple of...very fanservicey questions, I felt like? But the boys took it in stride and didn't seem at all bothered by any of it, so good for them. Well, at least BK took it in stride. He really stole the show for me during the q&amp;a part and I think this is less me being biased and more just how much he talked. For what it's worth, I was super unprepared for the Higher Choice part since I only found out I was going like an hour before it happened. I ended up asking them what would make them happiest in 2019 and how fans could help achieve that, and they said they wanted to put out more music, especially a full album, and have it do well/have fans like it. 

&amp;#x200B;

During the signing part, I brought my \_Adventures in Wonderland\_ album to be signed. I think most people brought albums; a couple of people might have brought banners? Wow has a really funny signature, stands out the most of the boys. I actually talked super briefly to BK during the signing, but I was mostly just thanking him/A.C.E. for being awesome and don't completely remember the exchange. I think I told him I was really happy to be there and he thanked me for coming. Jun has a super nice, warm smile in person. Donghun seems really shy. Chan seemed enthusiastic and also had a really full smile haha. In general, I thought the boys were lovely about it, it of course had to go by pretty fast but they didn't make it feel rushed or like they just wanted to get it over with or anything (probably helped that they only had to sign \~25 things at most).

&amp;#x200B;

For the picture part, a staff member (of the venue) took one photo for each of us on our phones. Each person got to pick the pose/who to stand next to. I was still trying to process everything that happened when I came up for the photo, so I probably seemed a bit uncertain. I think they were going to do the hearts thing, but BK noticed that I seemed a little lost and was like ""what do \_you\_ want?"" in English. So I just ended up taking a kinda regular, all arms around each photo, with me in-between Jun and BK. Honestly was how I felt most comfortable doing it (felt the most natural to me), and I really appreciate BK noticing that I was unsure and asking me what I wanted!

&amp;#x200B;

Staff handed out merch (there was a LOT), and that concluded the Higher Choice portion. I went and hung out in SF for a few hours before returning the venue around \~5:35 PM or so. They let VIP people in shortly after 6, which let me get a really good spot next to the barrier on the left hand side of the stage. Honestly, I was so close to the stage it was kinda hard to believe, and the members kept coming over, smiling, waving, bending down and singing at us, etc. A.C.E. definitely knows how to work the stage!

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, the concert itself was incredible. A.C.E. prepared a bunch of covers for us, since they don't have a ton of their own songs yet. (My dream is now to attend an A.C.E. concert once they have enough songs for a full setlist of their own). I seriously underestimated what a great vocalist Donghun is, he killed every song he said, I think he even ad-libbed some high notes at some point. It really wowed me. Chan and Jun are also strong vocalists live, and BK and Wow are great rappers/singers live, but I have to admit it was Donghun who I had really underestimated prior to the concert. No more. He's a seriously crazy talented vocalist, wow. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the performances were amazing, A.C.E. have fantastic stage presence and I couldn't take my eyes off them. They honestly might be one of the best groups out there in terms of dance right now. BK and Wow especially--again, \_wow. But don't underestimate the other 3 boys either. They did several dance covers to close out the concert, including of a Skrillex song (that one that goes 'call 911 now!') and it was \_absolutely insane\_ especially considering they were already drenched in sweat from performing at that point. Same to their Big Bang dance covers. They also had some super emotional performances, including covers of Western pop songs like See You Again that they basically dedicated to fans. They had a translator for all the talking portions. I didn't hear 100% of what was said (because even when they spoke, there was some screaming going on...) but I know they discussed how hard concerts are for them, physically and mentally, but that the fans make it all worth it. The last performance they did of Take Me Higher, where they got out the selfie cam and were kinda just messing around on stage, trying to film themselves/the crowd, was amazing. There was this energy in the room--as everyone sang along--that was just...hard to describe in words. It was a special experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the concert ended, I waited around for the hi-touch. As expected, it was very brief; the boys must have been absolutely exhausted, and there were a \_lot\_ of VIP people. Despite that, they actually shook hands and said ""thank you"" rather than just high fiving! BK actually held my hand for a lot longer than I expected because we both said ""thank you so much"" to each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, it was a really incredible evening. 10/10, would absolutely go to an A.C.E. concert again. A.C.E. is a group to watch, mark my words. They're charming yet goofy, have great chemistry as a group--on stage and off, are excellent performers, insanely hard workers, talented vocalists/rappers/dancers, and basically just deserve the world. If you have any questions about the experience, let me know!

I am not explaining the terms on purpose to not influence the answer, but I think a lot of people should consider understanding if one or other bias they have are actually an Idol or a Singer.

In time, I think a lot of well established **singers** in Korea are treated like an Idol, and demanded to behave and act like one, by far too many ""fans"", while the opposite is almost all too common to mention: No, *Idols* don't need to do lives with perfect vocals.

My estimate would be that the vast majority (90%+) either don't know the difference between these terms and carers, or don't know if their bias is one or the other, and the main reason is unfortunately because its easier to just label all of them as Idols and move on.",6,1,False,self,,,,,

So auto moderator dont take down this post! Lol.

So the last girl group to win artist of the year at MAMA was Girls Generation in 2011. Holy freaking cow thats a long time! I just wanted to pose a question to you all: when do you think a girl group will win AOTY again? Has the astronomical number of albums top boy groups sell these days make them untouchable?

These are some of my thoughts on the top 3 girl groups who most people probably think of. 

Red Velvet:

Pros: They are in the top agency in Korea and SM has a long history of producing legendary groups. They are the most versatile group imo going from cute to girl crush so easily.

Cons: With that history it puts immense pressure on the newer SM groups to establish themselves. Right now SM is mainly concerned with NCT so I dont know if RV will get the attention they deserve.


Blackpink:

Pros: They are without a doubt the most popular girl group worldwide (Kpop that is). All the songs have mind blowing numbers of streams and their MVs on YouTube rack up views like popcorn. 

Cons: YG lol 


Twice:

Pros: All of their title tracks have been mega hits and theyve been at the top of the game from debut to now. They can match top boy groups like GOT7, Seventeen, NCT in physical album sales and their digitals are remarkable. They have mass appeal and are very marketable.

Cons: The hate from people on their vocal line and the notion they are just a group of visuals. Also they dont have quite the mass appeal internationally as Blackpink or BTS does. Also I know their music appeals to the masses of idol fans, but Im not sure if appeals to people of all backgrounds. ",158,1,False,self,,,,,

So this fan account is going to be about the standard non-VIP bits, along with some musical/technical reviews in between. So let's get this show on the road!  


Before I get into the nitty gritty of the review, a few answers to questions I know people want answered:

* **Do the hot pants and crop tops make an appearance?** Nope. Wow is the only one who wore semi hot-pants during the finale.
* **So was there any sort of fanservice since the crop tops and hot pants didn't make an appearance?** Yup, we got biceps galore, semi-sheer tops, ab flashes, and some fanservicey dance moves.
* **They have a short discography, how in the world did they have a concert?** Besides all their original songs, the group did a mix of solo, unit, vocal, and dance stages to pad the runtime.
* **Did they perform the songs from their survival show auditions?:** No Gashina, but they did perform a 5 member version of ""Make It Nasty"".
* **How long was the concert?** Expect it to run about two hours.
* **Can I see the setlist?** Sure. You can see it by clicking [here.](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/ace/2018/the-fonda-theatre-los-angeles-ca-1b972170.html)

**The Review:**

So the show was held at August Hall, which is a pretty intimate venue. One of the upsides of this is that even if you had GA tickets, you could still see the stage relatively clearly with no major issues. I was near the back of the floor area, and I could still see all the boys' faces super clearly.

In terms of entrance time, plan to get there a bit early before doors open or soon after they do if you want merchandise. Even though I got to the venue 30 minutes before the show started, I cut it super close since I decided to get merch. Since there was only one person manning the booth, I literally got on the floor 2 minutes before the show started. So plan accordingly.

A few things about the merch in case you're planning on going to one of their upcoming shows.

* No lightsticks are available for sale. If you want one, you'll have to import it from Korea. But those were rare as hell too during their Seoul tour so it may be difficult to snag one.
* The black t-shirt sold is the same one the A.C.E members wore during the finale of the show. I'm assuming it'll be the same across all shows. So if that's your thing, buy that shirt.
* No albums are available for sale. So no luck to those hunting for Cactus or Callin' albums.

So any case, once the show started, things started off with a bang since the group started with their heaviest hitting songs: ""Cactus"" and ""Callin'"". From there, the setlist alternated between solo/unit stages and group stages.

Besides their group songs (which are all stellar), other performance highlights included:

* Black and Blue unit stage (June and Wow)
* Desert unit stage (Byeongkwan and Donghun w/ remaining three members joining in during the finale chorus)
* The dance cover medleys (both unit and group stages)
* See You Again / Love Me Like You Do cover

In terms of the ments, there was about three or four during the show. Mostly, it was done to give other members time to change or prepare for unit/solo stages. Yes, you read that right, they have four costume changes during the concert. It was pretty cool since it's something you wouldn't expect from a group with such a small discography.

In terms of English speaking ability (based on the ments), it seemed like the fluency of the members went like this:

* Chan
* Byeongkwan
* Jun
* Wow
* Donghun

However, there was a translator off-stage, so no worries if you don't understand Korean. The ments were pretty nice, and the members really came across as genuine and thankful for the opportunity to perform overseas. But man...Chan needs to get on variety, stat. Dude is like 4D Sunmi levels of extra and I love it. He was so hilarious!

Now in regards to their overall performance/artistry, I'm going to have to be real here.

Overall, I do think that they are one of the few groups from the third gen to accurately be named as a successor to SHINee. Their synchronization in their dancing, stage presence, and overall artistry is no joke. For being rookies, they are very polished in these regards.

That said, the only thing that is still a bit rough around the edges are their vocals. Poor Donghun, especially. Based on this setlist, he struggled the most with the high notes in the covers and high harmonization bits throughout various songs. He was even insanely flat at some points. I don't know the reason behind his vocal struggles, but based on what I saw, it seems like he's getting ""Tiffany-ied"".

What I mean by that is that in many of the songs throughout the concert, it seems like due to keys many of the songs were in, he was forced to sing slightly (or very) out of his vocal range. Thus, he strained very badly in an attempt to hit those notes. Unfortunately, this caused things to be bit messy vocally at times, most apparently during their harmonies on group songs. It's a shame, because his voice is stellar when utilized properly (see his performances on MIXNINE). Hopefully, this gets rectified soon, as I would hate to lose Donghun due to vocal nodules or some other vocal related issue.

In any case, outside of that minor quibble, the show was phenomenal. They did so much to keep the audience engaged, both with their song choices and stage presence, and really gave 100%. Hopefully, they come back in the future with a more robust setlist because they were great.

Also a few other notes:

* The venue will give you some sort of paper/ticket with a number. **IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP THIS.** During the show, the group will pick ten winners (5 VIP and 5 GA) to receive a signed poster or photocard. That paper/ticket with the number is your ""raffle ticket"" for these prizes. So don't lose it.
* Lightsticks and banners are allowed, so no worries if you want to bring those.
* Didn't see any fansite masters, though that could be due to the venue seemingly being strict on bringing DSR cameras in the venue.
* If you're short...you might have some issues seeing since ***so.many.people.had.their.cell phones.up.*** My one pet peeve about the show was that due to how the GA floor was set up (all flat), it took some maneuvering to find a spot where a cell phone wasn't blocking the view. I swear some people literally watched the whole show through their phones. So be warned.
* The hi-touch for VIPs is after the show. The Higher Choice event in much earlier in the day, so make sure if you have any of those, double check the times and plan things accordingly.

So to wrap things up, overall it was a great show (even though they had some vocal quibbles). This group is definitely one to look out for, and I'm hoping they get a stronger domestic fanbase because if they keep improving, they could easily be on the level of SHINee.

**Final Score: 9.5/10**

https://i.redd.it/o5501ezg9s121.png

Groups like Red Velvet and Blackpink are particular in that their group names describe the dual concept styles they pursue in their music. Red Velvet have their 'Red' side (predominantly brighter, energetic and upbeat pop music - ie: Dumb Dumb, Russian Roulette, Red Flavor, Power Up) and their 'Velvet' side (smoother, laid-back and/or R&amp;B-based tracks - ie: One of These Nights, Automatic, Bad Boy). With Blackpink, their 'Black' side tends to be closer to a heavier girl crush concept (ie: Whistle, Boombayah), while their 'Pink' side is said to be a lighter and cuter style (ie: As if It's Your Last). I find it especially interesting that these two groups used conceptually contrasting colors to describe the differences in their musical/visual concepts throughout their albums.

Thinking about this made me wonder, if I had the chance to come up with a similar explanation to describe different signature styles and concepts other groups/artists have pursued through their music, how would I do so?

For me, one possibility that I've thought about is DAY6's Every DAY6 Project. For anyone who doesn't know, for this project, DAY6 released a single and a b-side song every month throughout an entire year in 2017. They compiled all of these songs into two full albums; the Sunrise album for all the songs they released in the first half of the year, and the Moonrise album for all the songs they released in the second half of the year. When my friend and I discussed these albums before, we came up with a personal liking of separating them into 'Day' and 'Night' songs - 'Day' songs being those that are more hard-hitting in pace and/or brighter in concept and reminiscent of the day (the majority of these were compiled in the Sunrise album - ie: I'm Serious, Dance Dance, Man in a Movie, I Smile), and 'Night' songs being darker and often more mellow or softer than 'Day' songs (most of these were from the Moonrise album - ie: I Loved You, I Need Somebody, When You Love Someone, All Alone, I'll Try). Of course, their music styles are much more diverse than these two categories, and quite a few songs fell in a in-between category where they possessed elements of both styles and also other concepts (but that's a different discussion that I won't go into here lol) - and that holds true for any artist. However, I thought that a division of songs into 'Day vs. Night' concepts might be an interesting way to categorize DAY6's music styles in the same way it has been done for Red Velvet and Blackpink.

If you also had the opportunity to explain a group's signature concepts, and/or any significant duality in the predominant musical styles they've shown, how would you want to do so? If applicable, are there are any ways you would want to name your bias group's (or any group's) most signature musical concepts in this way, and what would you want to propose? Perhaps it might not be just dual concepts, but *several* that have had a significant presence in their discography throughout the years. It could be contrasts between alternating individual albums/eras (like with Red Velvet), a contrast between title tracks and b-side songs (for instance, some groups tend to focus on more mainstream pop styles for title tracks, while showing a flair for certain different music styles in their sidetracks, such as hip-hop, ballads, etc.), or just a significant shift in music style they've shown over the years or before/after a certain period in time. The names you want to propose don't necessarily need to coincide with the group's name (like with Red Velvet and Blackpink), but perhaps the group's name could also provide some interesting ideas and possibilities for concepts they could pursue to fit that name!",21,1,False,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/hvV8QUrLvIJh9H3Me5__0gMf8i3BdWH4uGIZtRyz0fc.jpg,,,,,

I noticed Key has a 'clippy' way of singing, as in, he doesn't elongate his words often).

For me, I would describe Seulgi's voice as having an archness that somehow makes her sound like an emotionally mature woman. On the other hand, she can also sound quite peppy and perky in Red songs. 

Would appreciateciate it someone would take a stab at Doyoung from NCT (a lot say he and Taeil sound identical, but I think there is a difference - I just can't put it in words) and Ryeowook from SJ! My other fav voices. ",133,1,False,self,,,,,

Part two

I was busy and I didn't have time to write this but today I have some time :)
Where we stopped? On Wednesday 24th. In the morning I went to buy an albums in order to attend a April's fansign on Saturday. The shop was opening at 11am I was there before opening time and I thought I will be first person to buy albums but some ahjussi fan was first. I originally planned to buy 3 albums, but that ahjussi bought 3, so I decided to go with 4 albums XD And the funny thing is that person behind me bought 5 albums XD

Honestly April wasn't a group which I follow like Dreamcatcher or WJSN. I pretty much kinda neglected them and you what? Now I'm regret it. I had like 4 chances to starting like them more before 2018. First was when I received a signed album from KBS during my first trip to Korea. I liked Tinkerbell but  after some time other groups released others songs, and I forget about them :( Then I heard about Chaekyung and Rachel being added to April. I liked Chaekyung since I was watching God of Music 2, so I was happy because of it. And after second time the situation became the same. In 2017 I was in October in Korea and April was promoting ""Take My Hand"". I wanted to go to music shows and fansigns but I didn't know how to do it. I managed only to attend to The Show with Korea Tourism Organization and I had luck to take a photo of Rachel before Music Bank. And that's pretty much all for 2017. I guess that time I started to liking April but they wasn't at the top for me. In March 2018 April released The Blue Bird I liked  the song and that pretty much all. And now I will write what happened that I starting to like April much much more, no really now April is a group which is on 2nd place in my ranking. First is obviously Dreamcatcher XD

Back to story :) Since I had an albums I could attend music shows again. Those 3 days without live music on programs was a hard time for me.  First program was MCountdown. I didn't bring my camera because I knew you can't enter with it and It's pretty crowded there. And you know what? Elris Sohee had a mini fan meeting after pre recordings and all I had was my smartphone camera. Yeah... I wanted to use a toilet and brush my teeth after lunch so I thought that the toilet in the building where Mcountdown is recorded will be quiet because all the fans will be outside of the toilet. And when I was entering to the toilet wild boy group appeared. Fangirls went wild. I just wanted to brush my teeth alone XD The boy group was Ateez. I didn't know what to do XD But then I was like I don't care. They can brush teeth in the toilet so do I. After I do what I had to do I wanted to exit  the toilet but I know there will be a crowd of fangirls with DSLRs and a big mess in front of enter. I left the toilet after Ateez XD I don't understand one thing. Why would you take a photo of your favourite group while they are entering or leaving toilet? 

And now it's time line check with April. I didn't know how April fan manager is looking but I remembered one fan which was a fan both of Dreamcatcher and April, so I was able to localize April's fans. After checking the attendance I received an attendance booklet and a photocard of Naeun. Then after some time fan managers started to play a paper stone scissors with each other to set and order of entering to the hall. April was 3rd or or 4th, basically in front. Like last time there were some tourists which were entering before fans. Luckily for me, I was standing near the stage. Before the performance of Ateez some fans of the group asked some of those tourist if they can switch places with them for Ateez stage. Those tourist ""didn't know English"". And then I switched my place with those fans. They were very thankful.  Then we had a April stage and it was fun. When I was going to music show with Dreamcatcher, I've noticed that April during final of music program wave to fans for short period of time and stand in the back and then leave stage quietly after ending. This time it was the same. I was like ok. 

Then we have Music Bank. Unfortunately it was raining since morning so I didn't go to take photos like I wanted and I arrived 1 hour before of line check for April. There was planned a WJSN mini fanmeeting, but It was cancelled because of the weather. I wanted to sign up for it, but I've chosen April XD. After line check with April you recive a sticker to a booklet and photocard. Normally those things are distributed by fan manager but this time it was 2 members from April which was doing it and its called fan manager event. This time it was Yena and Jinsol.  It was my first contact with April that close. This time I was pretty chilled out. I've took some photos and in my opinion the lighting was great so Yena and Jinsol was looking very pretty. Unfortunately that time I had a poor number so I wasn't able to attend Music Bank. That was the only time when I wasn't on music program :( So it was pretty rough start of being an fan of April... Here are the album of Yena and Jinsol: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/albums/72157702843232705

On Saturday I was busy because before Music Core April had a mini fanmeeting and after Music Core I was going to fansign :) Like always I arrived early for the line check place. I know there will be a lot of people because around 90 people registered for it. Checking the line took some time and after it we were lined up in 15 people rows. After short time April arrived. It was very cold but all members was wearing something warm. It was fun but it was short and I've took some photos. After mini fanmeeting everyone received a cookie and some beverage. I've ordered some hot hibiscus tea because it was cold. Then I rushed to a meeting place before Music Core. I wanted to stand during live show but unfortunately there wasn't a free spot for it :( But luckily I was able to attend Music Core :) Here are photos from mini fanmeeting: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/albums/72157672806000807

And now the fansign. It was my first fansign of April and second in total. I had no idea what to expect from April since I didn't liked them so much as I like them right now. One week took me and April from being not that much of fan to a dedicated one :p Back to the fansign. I arrived to the hall like 1 hour before time when they let people in. There were 2 ways to enter the lobby in front of hall. I was wondering why the doors I closed. I later found out, that I was standing in wrong place but I found a correct place. Before entering the everyone had to draw a seat number. I had number 55. I thought I will be in the center, but I wasn't. It was kinda bad spot if you wanted to take photos of all members, but awesome for taking photos of Naeun. The fansign began with blackout and some Halloween songs. Then April arrived and after some greetings talk the fansign begins. I was kinda stressed because of my camera and light condition. I'm overly ambitious and I didn't had good mood  because of it. I was waiting for my turn to go to the table and I was kinda calm before it. But then I totally blanked out. Luckily I remember something. Like Rachel and Yena grabbed my hand, and Chaewon was asking me if it's my first fansign. Ah and Yena even wrote oppa beside my name, it's sweet. Before ending of fansign everyone received a glowing halloween themed lollipop. Honestly I was more stressed at the April fansign than on Dreamcatcher one. Here are the photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/albums/72157702755470174

At Sunday I wake up early I went to Inkigayo pre recordings. I had to wake up at 5:30 am to be on time before line check. Honestly I couldn't sleep well that night and after wake up I was asking myself do I really want to see April? It was a crisis. Rain outside wasn't helping but I've made decision. I don't care, I'm going to Inkigayo! Luckily it stopped raining but I arrived half asleep to the line check meeting spot. After checking attendance it was starting to rain again. I had umbrella and I wore long padding so I didn't care about weather :) I was fully conscious when April was performing but I wasn't fanchant as loud as for Dreamcatcher because I was afraid of my throat so I was giving like 50%of what I could do. After pre recordings I ate something in convenience store and was waiting for line check before live show. From a lot of people only around 1/3 left. Seating before music programs are limited and you what? In the beginning there wasnt a seat for 5 fans of April which includes me but somehow fan manager was able to find additional tickets. Yes, I've entered the Inkigayo for the third time in row. I was very happy! 

Then we had a Monday. You can ask what music program is on Monday? It's pre recordings for Simply K-pop. I was before meeting time for Arirang. I've become a friend with someone from overseas. I remember that I told him that I'm not shouting fan that because I'm afraid about my throat. The seating is very close to the stage and is on the sides of it. If a performing groups had a revealing clothes you could will feel very uncomfortable. April had a 2 stages in a row and haven't changed outfits like other teams. And they were first to perform. It was fun but too short :( 

On Tuesday I went to The Show for the second time during this trip. I originally planned to go to Dreamcatcher performance in Pyeongtaek but I've made some research and it wasn't worth it. The problem with that event it was for students. Traveling 2 hours to Pyeongtaek and not being able to see Dreamcatcher was a bad idea during my last week in Korea. So after I read that there is fan manager event with April before The Show, I knew what I have to do :) It's started casually with pre recordings. There were some mess because they let people which are above 170 cm to the standing area because there were a lot of Monsta X fans which were seating. But camera director decided that this wasn't a good idea so they moved us to the seating. This time I was shouting fancahnt at about 70%. After pre recordings we had the fan manager event just like before Music Bank last time. This time members which greeted fans were Chaekyung and Rachel. I had number 6 so I was in a first row very close and I had tele lens and 35mm with me. I took some photos which I like and after the event we had some spare time just to eat something. After eating I've met in a cafe a friend which is also a April's fan. The cafe is in the SBS Prism Tower building. I've ordered green tea latte, received it and just talk with my friend. Then out of nowhere Yoojung and Suyeon from Weki Meki appeared. I was like OMG. But I wasn't doing anything special because well idols are people too. I will not bother them. Even if your bias in a group is standing behind you XD My friend and me just continue our conversation.  After this we had a line check for live show. Only 13 fans of April was able to enter.  And now something interesting. Normally other fandoms shouting fanchant for their favourite group even if the stage on tv is pre-recorded, because the artist are performing on the stage in the studio. But I've heard that it's quite quiet during April stage so I started shouting fanchant for April on like 120% XD I think I was the only person which done this. I haven't learned the fanchant fully and it was hard for me to shout out everything and during my pauses I couldnt hear fans. And after that I saw that April members started noticing me more :) This was a turning point.  Here are photos from that event:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/albums/72157701459126761

And now it's time for Halloween and last time I saw Dreamcatcher this year. Day started calmly and I was meeting my friend in Gangnam at 12 am for lunch. After the meeting I went to Sinchon where I was staying and where there was a busking event with Dreamcatcher. I arrived to Sinchon around 4:00 pm because I had to buy some stuff from Etude House for my friend back in Poland. The shop was near the place where there will be a busking event. I saw that there people are gathering. I've bought what my friend asked me and I rushed to my stay for camera. It was like 5 minutes by foot. I was at the busking event at around 4:30 pm. I asked other fans when they arrived and some of them were there since 11 am. I also asked about that Pyeongtaek event if they took any photos from Dreamcatcher's performance. They took photos only during commute. I knew it wasn't worth it to go to Pyeongtaek . Time passed quickly and Dreamcatcher appeared. Everyone went nuts. Dreamcatcher performed all of the title songs. During Good night audio ended in the middle of a song but fans were continue singing it and Dreamcatcher was able to finish the song. After the event Dreamcatcher were giving a candies to the audience. The event was awesome and I've took a lot of photos. Later I found that someone made a gif from a moment when Handong is posing me for a photo. I'm talking about [this](https://gfycat.com/terribleorangeindianrhinoceros) gif and [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/45600633372/in/album-72157672940881297/) is a photo which I took. I'm also very happy from this photo of Handong. It was the last time before my return flight to Poland when I was able to see them and Handong was waving good bye for me :) She is very nice. I don't know why she is that underrated. I like all of Dreamcatcher members but Handong slightly more XD 
Here are the photos from a Halloween busking event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/albums/72157672940881297 

Back to April. This time before M Countdown Chaewon from April was filming for MOMO x  in a cafe in Seoul. Before that event on the fancafe was a info where we need to gather. The problem was address and name of the cafe didn't matched on maps both Daum, Naver and Google. I decided to go for the place where the name is matched. I even drag my friend there. I was there first and imagine my shock when I found out it was a bad place. Then a get a notification from a twitter where is the right place to meet. I met my friend during running for bus which took us to the right place. We were around 5 minutes before line check. After checking attendance we wait for a bit and Chaewon arrived. Fans were entering to the cafe in order of numbers. I was number [11](http://blog.colourfulrebel.com/en/files/2017/11/img_7698.jpg). Inside Chaewon was preparing beverages to the fans. There were 3 options: Americano, Orange Aid and Choco-Shake. I decided for Choco-Shake. I drank it for the first time and it was very tasty. The cup holders where signed by Chaewon :) When all gathered fans received their drinks lucky few had an opportunity to take a selfie with Chaewon. She selected numbers herself and give a reason why. It was 1st November and I had number [11](http://blog.colourfulrebel.com/en/files/2017/11/img_7698.jpg) and I was selected!!! Here it is: https://www.instagram.com/p/BpslCEEFIb_/ This photo is kinda sharp, the second one is blurry. Filming took almost 2 hours and after it I was able to eat something and hide my camera in a coin locker in MBC. This time before M Countdown I was praying not meet any idol near toilet especially April. It will very awkward XD Like last time I had good spot but this time it was very crowded. Behind me were a fans of boysband. When they favorite artist was performing I crouched because I didn't want to block a view. Later thanked me :) When fromis_9 were preparing for their stage, they make a formation and Hayoung was looking straight at me. She smiled to me so I smiled back. Then there was a April stage. This time I was prepared for shouting because I've bought a cough drop. I gave all what I had XD That scream in the of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnzFeWT47U) video is mine XD After April's stage I retreated to back of the standing area because it will be hard to stand during finale. Before the end when April members were noticing and were about to wave back to me Monsta X members stand in front of them. Theyve blocked April XD After finale I was able to wave to April without any problem and they waved back :)  Here are the photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/albums/72157701531037501 

Also here is a MOMO x episode with Chaewon: https://www.vlive.tv/video/97895 

On Friday it was Music Bank. I didn't had time to take some photos before the show because I was packing my luggage and had something important to do.  I was afraid I will be not on time for line check before Music Bank but I somehow arrived to KBS 30 minutes before meeting time. I've runned into a friend who works there and we had small talk because I was busy XD This time a had pretty good number so I was able to enter for live show. I was very concerned about it because EXO had a comeback on Music Bank and it could be packed. We had a seats in a last row but it wasn't that bad. On Music Bank artist line up before their stage like 2-3 songs before theirs. You can have a nice interactions with them. So when I noticed April I started to wave normally but then I don't if it was me or Jinsol started doing silly stuff like sending air arrows or goofy waving. Others members joined and it was fun. Based on April reaction they liked it too XD Other fans didn't went nuts like me. This happened when Fromis_9 and Weki Meki were performing on stage. It was like a combo with 3 songs which I liked the most during music shows and it finished with ""Oh My Mistake"". During April stage I was shouting like theres no tomorrow. Before finale interaction with April continued XD  When they were entering stage April rushed to a place where April fans were nearest. I had great fun and what more important April had great fun too :) And now something which I didn't like. That time Monsta X won 1st place and when they started to saying goodbye non Monsta X fans were starting to leaving Music Bank. It was very rude towards Monsta X. So I was just waiting for them to finish the thanks. Because there weren't that much people, I come closer to Monsta X and with few members I exchanged that male ""thank you"" gaze. You know what I mean?  During that Music Bank I spent very awesome time.

And now the last day of my trip to Korea this year. I found out at fancafe that there is a mini fanmeeting event with April before Music Core so I set up my schedule to fit it. I wasn't planning to go for a live show because I was meeting my friend. Like always I was way before line check time. When fan manager was checking attendance next to the place where April where going to have a mini fanmeeting, IZ*ONE fans were starting to gather. IZ*ONE mini fanmeeting started around 12:15 pm and I was meeting my friend at 1:00 pm. Can you feel the tension? After some unplanned delay April mini fanmeeting started at 1:10 pm. But before start every fan received fishcake and tteokbokki. I don't like tteokbokki that much, so I asked a fan manager if is it what it is look like. She confirmed that it's tteokbokki and say that just try it maybe it will be not that spicy XD I ate it and it was very tasty. After eating I told the fan manager that tteokbokki which I ate were tasty. After short while April arrived and mini fanmeeting started. Luckily my friend came late and she was watching mini fanmeeting. Later she told me that Rachel is the prettiest. During fan meeting there were a competition for April to gather  photocards of themselves from fans. Later those photocards were signed. And you know what? My photocards where on shelf near my bed. But I don't mind. It was the last time when I was seeing April before return to Poland :( After mini fanmeeting I say goodbye to my friends who's like April and also to the fan manager. April's fan manager was very kind and very friendly person. Big thanks to her.  After this event I've met my friend and I went to me other friend XD And this how it ended.  Here are the photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/134924840@N03/albums/72157703235460415

In summary I spent a great in Korea mainly because of Dreamcatcher and April. After it I'm refreshed and my self-esteem skyrocketed. Honestly I was planning to give up on photography but somehow it didn't happened and now I have others ideas for it :) If you have any question just ask in the comments. Thank you :)

Other bridges like in no particular order:
1) Don't wanna cry-Seventeen 
I love love love Wonwoo's voice in the bridge, the song was skewing very much into Chainsmokers territory but that bridge saved the song I think, it was so Seventeen.

2) Almost every NCT 127 song- Limitless, Chain, Simon Says, Touch
Now I almost expect God tier bridges every cb from them, they've really spoilt me

3) What is love? by Twice
Jihyo's voice is so good, it always gives me chills

4) Red Light- F(x)
Spectacular, gold standard really imo

5) Red Flavor- Red Velvet 
Almost all of Korea and the world jammed to 'Geuroni malhae', that's all..

Reasons doesn't have to be limited to just preferring the demo's musical choices. Share some links if you can!

Personal favOriTes for different (reasons):

* A top youtube comment for EXO's [Call Me Baby Demo](https://youtu.be/6zu28Kec2bA?t=26)  cannot sum it up more aptly: *""I guess [call me baby](https://youtu.be/yWfsla_Uh80) is the kidz bop version""* (for hilarity)  


* It doesn't have the fizzy charm &amp; cool sonic details of the [finalized track] (https://youtu.be/B9fXtJswxno?t=179) but those simple yet emotionally charged chords &amp; layered vocal arrangements in [LOONA's Stylish demo] (https://streamable.com/lysna) just sounds so magical. (love the musical direction)

* Not sure what went down behind the scenes &amp; how it got passed around  but I'm glad they didn't change [***that pre-chorus***](https://youtu.be/uQEga8Ot9q0?t=40) in the [finalized version](https://youtu.be/mj0uWajFhTo?t=42) of La Vie En Rose. This being a CLC demo makes alot of sense since its graceful vibe doesn't align with GG debut music trends which usually sound bombastic,cutesy or both in some way. (Based on what I've heard anyway.)

Have you heard E'dawn's new song? The lyrics are quite painful really:

You and me on top of the worldWhy is that we can only walk one path

Will flower bloom amongst the hazy road?

Or will they be trampled on while it's still a bud?

Seemingly forgotten, my name and my heart

If I look behind me while longing for them

 Trash, they say youre trash, they say Im trash (oh god)

Why, mom why, dad why , why is it like this?

 Enough of this shitty consolation

Please leave me alone so I can go crazy dance floor

If love is what's being locked up

I'd rather you kill me and lock me up instead

 Time please don't go on.

Your months will soon surpass you

It's obviously the end though since they will cut all the way through you always.

So what are some more **recent** k-pop songs (like, around or after 2014, but really anything 3rd gen) that you think seem incredibly difficult or challenging to perform? A song that you would see someone cover and think ""wow, that song seems so difficult, I'm impressed!""

Note that when I say ""perform"" I don't just mean dance - imagine this song being covered live in front of a stage audience or by a busker/group on the street. Dancing, singing/rapping, stage presence, crowd interaction, etc. The whole package.

(Especially stage presence. I've noticed a lot of songs are relatively easy to replicate, but not so much when it comes to the attitude and stage presence of the original performer.)",65,1,False,self,,,,,

One was in Gangnam (COEX Mall) the other was in Euljiro 1ga (Ferrum Tower).

The first was one of those open fansigns where the surrounding people who were not part of the sign were able to mill around and watch. I was running a bit late as I was coming from Hongdae (where I live) and the train journey is almost one hour. I got there and got my number for the sign - I was number 4. I screamed internally as it meant I was one of the first people to go up and meet Sam as well as being right at the front. Death!

He came out to various screams and cheers and performed two songs - Make Up and , and then after the fansign began. The Saturday one I was actually getting a sign for my best friend in the UK as a Christmas present/early birthday present. Conversation went something like this:

Sam: Hey!  
Me: Hey fam, hows it going? \[I sit down\] Oh by the way, my name isn't XXX, it's XXX. But I am getting this for my best friend.  
Sam: Oh? How come?  
Me: She was the one who introduced me to you when No  first came out. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here in the first place. So I am getting this as a gift for her!  
Sam: That's so amazing! I'm thankful to her... so her name is XXX right?  
Me: Yep! Oh, also, I got you this notebook... nothing much but it has an inspirational quote in here that I hope will motivate you in the future.  
Sam: \[eyes widening\] I love things like these! I use quotes to inspire me to write more every single day. It's important to keep ourselves going. I will definitely use this in the future!  
Me: It means a lot... you are such an inspiration as a foreigner living here in Korea. I only wish you success and happiness in the future.  
Sam: \[huge grin\] Thank you so much! I promise that I will read your letter too!

I died. Like, it was so easy to talk to him, especially as for once I could just casually speak in English but inside I was a mess. The entire fansign went in a flash and I observed what was happening around me. There was a lot of male fans there, including a really cute couple who went together. Sam hugged all the male fans and at the end, there was a special polaroid event where five lucky fans were able to have a picture with me. I wasn't picked. I was sad, [but then he came down to have a group picture and plonked himself right next to me!!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq18IqYnJpD/) (I was front and centre in terms of the actual fansign itself so that was uber lucky!)

Sunday I got into as well. I went out clubbing the night before so I was feeling a bit rough but managed to drag myself down there. There were less people than the previous day (mainly because you had to buy the album in Nowon and that is far on the east of Seoul). This time I decided to be entertaining and do a little impromptu ""Mans Not Hot"" with Sam -  [you can watch the video here of the mess xD](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq6F7H5lWRm/) A few of us felt bad that there were not as many fans there but we needn't of have worried. After his performances (It's You and an acoustic version of ) we were treated to a special Selca Day where we were able to have solo pictures with Sam!

All in all, it was an amazing weekend. I have been a fan of his for a long time now so to be able to meet and talk to him was an honour! If you haven't already, do check out his most recent releases: [Make Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1iFxWW_WjY) (ft Crush), [It's You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uyl_ifBiLE) (ft Zico) and [When You Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xYEOPAGImo) (ft Chai).

This event consists of hours of high-five events and other fan interactions. The schedule announced puts this event as at least 6h per day, but its not unusual for these events to go over 12h as theres no limit on how many times you can enter.  
This event takes place only days after NUEST Ws Seoul concerts December 15-16, shortly after promotions and in the middle of Award- and Year-End shows season.  
LOVEs immediately took to the fancafe and twitter to protest Pledis decision. The hashtag \#__ was trending in Korea. With NUESTs past bad experiences during Japanese promotions in mind, many LOVEs are opposing the event.  
This is NUEST Ws first Japanese event since Produce. They have not had any concerts or past events there as NUEST W, that could justify this decision in any way.

I thought maybe it was because girl groups dont have enough fans, but even boy groups that arent super well known come and tour here in America. It just seems too bizarre to stay away from a potential big source of income. Like groups such as BTS,GOT7,NCT, must make a lot of money from touring.

Anyways, I am just curious for the people who are fans of each style, what is it about that style that makes you prefer it? For example, I prefer cute concept because it cheers me up when I'm sad. ""Cheer Up"" by Twice never fails to make me smile when I'm sad. Or when I'm in a good mood it makes my mood better or has a calming effect like Gfriend's ""Love Whisper"". So that's why I prefer it. 

In contrast, songs that are more edgy,edm,w/e make me feel more serious. So I tend not to prefer them. BUT when I'm lacking confidence sometimes songs like ""DDU-DU DDU-DU"" by Blackpink will leave me feeling like I'm a bad \*itch and can conquer the world.",26,1,False,self,,,,,

As a big BTS fan i honestly find myself not liking some of their recent comebacks (at least not the titletrack) but sort of forcing myself to learn to love it/get into it. I think I set expectations based on what a group has formerly done, and if they then experiment with a new sound it can feel off-putting. I love when groups make comebacks obviously, because it means both new music, but also new concepts, new styling and of course new performances, but if the titletrack just isn't sitting right with me it can be hard to get through it sometimes. So I'm basically wondering how you guys cope with unfulfilling comebacks or just a comeback that isn't in your personal taste. ",87,1,False,self,,,,,

You don't have the knowledge of any of your favourite group's 2018 releases, you know their music up to 2017. Someone plays a playlist of all songs released in 2018 by all groups, if you have to pick a song that it is by your favourite group which song would it be? and why?

For example, I would immediately recognise [Sassy Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvjO_sw4r4I) to be Red Velvet's song. It has all the Red Velvet elements, funky instrumentals, weirdness of Attaboy, amazing vocals, harmonies, great bridge, a high note by Wendy. Sassy me is either a NCT or a Red Velvet track, since it has female vocals therefore it is RV's.

Sorry to fans of groups who debuted in 2018, you guys can create your own rules and try. Like for Gidle you only have knowledge of their debut title track 'LATATA' then guess from there.",12,1,False,self,,,,,

Or it could be a song that would instantly lighten your mood once you hear it?

First off, I always tell myself I'm fine not getting married lmao! But I'm certainly not closing my doors... However, last night, I suddenly wanted to get married after hearing Jae's Better Man. LIKE ASDGFJSKSISJSBD??? Then and there I wanted to hire Jae as my wedding singer!! Or he could be my groom if destiny allows (jk). If only I'm filthy rich then I'm certainly inviting any of my faves to sing on my wedding.

The second one has been a classic favorite of mine  Super Junior's No Other. I even tell my friends that if someone did something from the MV to me, then he's the one (not really but has a higher chance, you get my point).

Other than that, kpop has always saved me, and inspired me to continue my hobbies (e.g. writing and art).

What about you? I'd love to hear your stories! :)",1,1,False,self,,,,,

**Basically, what I mean by this topic is...What's one of the best/funniest/heart-warming things that really made you thinking ""Wow, I really love this group, and I feel really happy/proud to be their fan!"" It could be something as simple as how a thank you speech or ment was touching/meaningful or something bigger.** 

This post was inspired because I am an ARMY aka a fan of BTS. There have been COUNTLESS moments that I could describe, but I wanted to highlight a recent one. 

Yesterday was Jin's birthday in South Korea, and for the celebration, ARMYs on Twitter became a part of the Jin clan having the same profile picture on Jin in white sunglasses (it's a Bangtan Bomb/Episode reference where he was joking that it should be his birthday picture or something lol). It was just supposed to be a fandom thing along with the usual ""ugly"" pictures that BTS members post of the member too, but THEN, someone from BTS (I have my money on Jin himself since this is the guy who has planned his own birthday party before and is the guy known for stealing fan edits haha...i.e. the Jin ""scream"" picture) [changed the layout](https://preview.redd.it/6u78xq5d85221.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=914e4b23ce2edf0fad22261d1a94cd9508e9b0bc) of the BTS Twitter page to the Jin pictures that fans had also too. It was so surprising to see the official account being a part of the fun! :)

It was actually a fan edit, but it was such a cute and funny moment because we all realized BTS and ARMYs truly just share one braincell together, and it was really heart-warming because we were just having fun with such a small thing. But yeah, yesterday was awesomeeven with Jins handwritten letter and him having a V Live to play games with the fans :( &lt;3 

Things as simple as this really solidify why I love themmusic, personalities, relationship with the fans, and all.

So this is the official light band for day6 that my friend wants for Christmas. Idk anything about kpop or where to buy merch, all ik is that she wants it. It's kinda expensive and i'm wondering if there's another place i can buy it online? I understand also that since its the official site then any other place would be fake and/or not supporting the band so I get it if there's no other good option, but if there's anything I'm all ears.

-----
Hello, i'm your friendly argumentative user nomoreiloveyous here with a completely free-to-you giveaway of 5 RBB albums. I am doing what i am going to call a Flash Giveaway. I normally do giveaways for SHINee on the r/SHINee sub and allow for a few days - a week for the application period. However to shake things up i will be doing a 24 hour blink-and-you-miss-it entry period. So 24 hours after this has been posted is when i will stop taking applications. **That is, this closes at 5PM CST on 12/05/2018**. 

-----

RULES:

* I apologize in advance but **this is only open to USA-ians** (those that reside in the USA). I want these sales to count directly on Billboard. Additionally, for the cost of buying and shipping internationally 1 album i can instead buy and ship 2-3 albums domestically through Amazon. Moneys tight yo.
* You must provide your full name (first and last) and a full address (street (building/apartment number if necessary), city, zip code, and state) to me by **11PM CST 12/05/2018**. I will be drawing winners immediately after closing the giveaway and notifying winning participants right after through PM. If you do not respond by the cut-off i will select a new winner. Also, please make sure you are old enough to receive packages from internet strangers and not have to try and hide it from mom and dad.
* This is for the r/kpop community so please do not link to other platforms. As such, while winners are chosen randomly, i will throw out any brand new accounts that apply. If you want to apply on behalf of someone else that is totally cool, but you must give me either your or their full information just the same. If you've won one of my prior giveaways you can still enter here. 
* You must answer every question, and i cant force you to but please answer with more than one word to make for a more interesting read for me. It doesnt have to be an essay (though if you want to, go for it) but id like to know why. 

-----

To enter the giveaway all you need to do is answer all 5 (one for each album being given away) of the following questions in a comment below. 

1. What is your favorite song on RBB and why?
1. What is your favorite thing (anything at all, just be positive please) about your least favorite song on RBB and why?
1. What is your favorite Red Velvet live stage this calendar year and why?
1. What new genre would you like Red Velvet to try next and why?
1. What is your favorite household appliance or power tool and why?

So with it being about 7 months since Produce 48 first began airing, and with 2018 almost behind us, I thought it would be nice for people who followed the show/specific girls (especially the JP contestants) to have an update on what the participants have been up to and what's in store for them in 2019!

First thing to note, due the nature of a lot of pre-debut stuff kept under rumor/wraps, anything not official confirmed via a label/contestant is either speculation or rumor and will be marked with an ""\*"" to note that.

***NOTE:*** I know that some kerfuffle arose about Sakura and Nako attending HKT48's 8th Anniversary concert. However, as OTR has clarified that it is a sanctioned individual schedule done as members of IZ\*ONE (and not as HKT members), their status in HKT is still officially ""on hiatus.""

If you happen to see an update on a contestant that I missed, please feel free to let me know and I'll update the OP.

Also, for my own piece of mind and interest, I'll be doing an update post for both the contestants for PD101 Season 1 and Season 2 in the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for that.

**Additional Things/Rumors to Note:**

* ASX made the most recent AKB48 single PD48 themed, with three songs (one A-side and two coupling songs) featuring the Japanese contestants of PD48. The contestants were broken out as such:  
\- Rank #1-20: participated on ""No Way Man"" (unranked contestant Tanaka Miku also participated on this track)  
\- Rank #21-52: sang on ""[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8AX1hzaCzc)"" as members of a specially made PD48 senbatsu  
\- Rank #59-91: sang on ""!"" as members of the specially made ""Team Nice Fight"" senbatsu
* Lee Chaeyeon was [introduced](https://www.kpopmap.com/ggumnamu-kpop-profile/) in Dec 2017 as a member of [ggumnamu](https://www.instagram.com/wm_ggumnamu/?hl=en), which is  a group of WM female trainees in contention to be in the lineup for WM's upcoming girl group. It is unknown if Chaeyeon is still in contention for the group due to the length of her IZ\*ONE contract (though it's likely she is). Both Seunghyeon and Yeongin were also introduced as members of ggumnamu.
* Han Chowon is slated to be a member of CUBE's future girl group with Lee Joohyeon (who participated in *The Unit*). The group is rumored to debut in 2020 or 2021, likely some time after CUBE's planned boy group with Lai Guanlin and Yoo Seonho debuts.
* Pledis and Stone Music are rumored to be collaborating to form a group slated to debut in 2019. The rumored lineup is Lee Gaeun, Heo Yunjin, Lee Haein, Lee Sian, Natty, Bae Eunyoung, Bin Haneul (Sky). Supposedly, an unnamed Japanese trainee will also be included in the lineup (either as an additional member or replacing one of the girls listed above). No word on if it's a JP PD48 contestant or a normal trainee.
* Banana Culture has been promoting a group of female trainees including Kim Nayoung on their official trainee [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRBwshEPlFs). It is assumed that these trainees will be members of Banana Culture's upcoming girl group. As Kim Dahye has not been featured in any trainee video after the completion of PD48, it is assumed that she has left the label.
* RBW has been heavily pushing a group of five female trainees (including Na Goeun and Park Jieun) on their official trainee [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCor8nQnEdMs4eBcU-uVBQ8g/videos) The five featured girls are assumed to be part of a future RBW girl group.
* HOW Entertainment specially put an audition notice on an August 2018 [instragram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm4SuF0B-T-/) of the HOW PD48 trio, indicating that a debut might be in the works.
* CNC has been posting videos of the PD48 CNC girls (Kim Dayeon, Yoon Eunbin, Lee Yujeong, Hong Yeji, and Kim Yubin) on their official CNC School [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn0RmYnniJI/). It is assumed that the girls featured in these videos will be part of a future CNC group.
* The MND17 girls (Park Minji, Park Chanju, and Lee Chaejeong) jointly said in a September 2018 [interview](https://twitter.com/parkminjipics/status/1041118878691196928) that a group debut was ""coming soon"". It is unknown if any additional members will be added to this lineup.
* As Cho Ahyeong was not included in the final lineup of Cherry Bullet, it is rumored she left FNC after the conclusion of PD48.",78,1,False,self,,,,,

I know this is a general K-Pop forum, but I thought this was important enough to post. My names Kevan and we may have interacted before as I usually pay r/kpop a visit before k-pop artists stop by my other shows like Billboard, BUILD series of FanPage but tomorrow, Monsta X will be my guest on MTV's TRL. This is big for a lot of reasons. They're the first ever K-Pop group to appear. TRL is on national television here in the United States and a strong showing of fan engagemnet + viewership would send a big message to MTV to have more K-Pop acts on as guests in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

The official TRL twitter is currently taking fan questions (including video submissions) we'll ask the guys on the show tomorrow. If you're  a fan or full on monbebe - take a minute and submit a question, shoot TRL a retweet and help spread the message if you'd like.

For those of you who don't know this feature, you can go to https://spotifywrapped.com/ and get your personalized recap showing statistics such as top 5 artist/song/genres and more. 

My personal recap: https://imgur.com/a/OgKud3z (since I'm german, the recap is also in german but the categories should be obvious)
This year I started getting into K Pop probably around the release of 'Fake Love'. Before that I knew K Pop existed, but expect for the occasional reaction videos from the fine brothers I didn't really have any contact with the genre. I started listening to more and more BTS songs and suddenly I found myself stanning them, watching every kind of content out there. Through r/bangtan I came across this sub and started to explore the depths of the genre more instead of solely listening to BTS. Ultimately this led to me falling in love with K Pop and recently I don't really listen to anything else as you can guess from my spotify recap. :D",154,1,False,self,,,,,

Any KPop historians or google machine wizards know of any children of former KPop Idols who are following their parents who trailblazed the way to the KPop we empty our wallets on?

obviously neither group retain their previous status (as in % of their fans in the whole kpop fandom has fallen as kpop manages to reach a much wider audience), but their group careers are still pretty solid. tvxq sold over 1m tickets for a single japan tour this year, and their latest korean album managed to sell \~150k. super junior's latest korean EP also sold \~150k, while their last korean album sold \~500k, and their recently completed concert tour had an audience of \~330k.  

tvxq debuted earlier (2003) than super junior (2005), but the super junior members are older. yunho is 32 while changmin is 30, but the oldest super junior members are already 35. both groups are performance-focused groups though, so i wonder how long they can continue releasing dance tracks regularly... will their musical style have to change? or will they just promote less often?

and do you think your biases' current model/concept/style is one that can be sustained as they grow older?",54,1,False,self,,,,,

813,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-12-7,2018,12,7,18,a3ya9w,self.kpop,What's everyone's opinions on fans and/or haters having and/or faking concern for idols?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a3ya9w/whats_everyones_opinions_on_fans_andor_haters/,teenytokki,1544174157,"Sorry this is my first post on this reddit, I don't think it violates the rules nor have I seen it being discussed but if it does I'll gladly take it down.

I was listening to IU's Bbibbi whilst reading the comments, and was pretty surprised that many people assumed the song was about all her haters, saesangs, etc. which it yes could be about as well. From a lot of the lyrics however I was guessing it was about anyone invading her personal boundaries, INCLUDING fans. This is probably (?) not that new but has been increasingly harder to ignore lately; in every comment section you'll find people speculating on the mental health of an idol or talking about how they're ""concerned"". Weight in particular seems to be a favourite for everyone to comment on, but it can really be anything like a 5 second shot of your fav idol not smiling. 

I get that people care for their idols and I find comments that come out of genuine concern and love pretty sweet. But a lot of comments also read, personally to me, as pretty condescending, and I find excessive concern over little issues to be pretty annoying too. Go into the comment section of any video related to a ""scandal"" and you'll find loads of comments infantilizing idols who are like 10 years their senior and digging themselves five layers deep into assumptions. The mental illness theories as well are also super uncomfortable to read ;;

Admittedly ""haters"" use concern as a thin veil to criticize idols so that doesn't help the issue either. This ""fake concern"" thing has become imo more of an issue just in general for anyone who's a public figure so I suppose it comes with the gig. 

Has it always been like this and I'm just noticing it now, or is it getting worse? I also know a lot of people defend having concern for their idols (which I agree with when not in excess) and I'm curious to hear from both sides. 

Examples are: Red Velvet Wendy's weight fluctuations (this is what comes to my mind primarily), BLACKPINK Jennie's ""lack of enthusiasm"" as of late, insert-popular-worry-creating-boy-group-topic-here (sorry I don't follow boy groups that much). ",7,1,False,self,,,,,

And then the other three said that streaming a song won't count until the downloaded song wasn't deleted. I then said that it'll count as long as it's not the mp3 file playing. You only need to clear the music player and then play the song that's not on the download music folder so the song will count as a stream. But the other four insisted that it needs to be deleted and just download the song multiple times. Now I'm very confused. I could've sworn that many of the Melon guidelines I read are the same as mine. So I checked the recent ones and not much specify about the downloads. I only managed to find an FB of a BTS explicitly saying no stream will ever count as long as the downloaded file is not deleted. So what's exactly the correct process?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

857,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-12-8,2018,12,8,2,a41v4j,self.kpop,Why does sexual harassment usually get brushed off as cute or funny when its between members of the same group?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a41v4j/why_does_sexual_harassment_usually_get_brushed/,bruisedlove,1544202659,"First of all, I know this is a heavy subject, and that sexual harassment shouldnt be said too lightly, but I honestly dont know what else to call it.

So many times have I seen idols force skinship onto their fellow members, even when its clearly unwanted. One example could be a girl randomly grabbing another girls boobs and butt, or a guy insistently getting all up in another guys personal space and touching him intimately. 

Usually the members reaction is a chill this happens all the time and it doesnt bother me kind, maybe even reciprocating it with some touching of their own, in which case thats obviously fine. Theyre both in on it, whatever. Other times however, its really obvious that the passive member is surprised, uncomfortable, annoyed and even downright angry at the intrusive contact. A lot of idols have even voiced this discomfort, to no avail.

Its never taken seriously, neither by the surounding people nor the fans. In fact, fans seem to love that shit. It makes them scream their lungs out at concerts, write a bunch of fanfics and make cute ship videos about how tsundere the uncomfortable person is, or how sad the poor initiator must feel to constantly have their advances rejected. 

Im pretty damn sure a lot more people would take issue with this if it was between a man and a woman. Actually, I can think of several instances where celebrities (both male and female) have been accused of harassment just for breathing around the opposite sex, which is of course complete horseshit. The forced intimacy between same gender group members on the other hand would absolutely be considered sexual harassment in any other situation, so its just weird that Ive never seen any critical discussions about it. 

I understand that the members are probably coerced by their own company and management to do a lot of those things, so in a way they are victims too and shouldnt take all the blame, but I still think its worthy of criticism. 

Any thoughts?",54,1,False,self,,,,,

Pledis was [deleting](https://twitter.com/jHollywoodstar/status/1068891310508118017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1068891310508118017&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fonehallyu.com%2Ftopic%2F747570-pledis-in-hot-water-with-three-of-their-groups-fandoms-this-weeks%2F) fancafe comments asking about a comeback for the group, they have yet to address the status of one of the members and are letting rumors float about the situation without doing much about it.       

Next we had the NU'EST W Japanese hi-touch event problem. The reason whyL.O..Es were so against it was apparently because it was supposed to last for seven hours and NU'EST attended such events in the past and had allegedly gotten mistreated there by the fans in attendance. Fans were allowed to touch them however they want them, pose them to their liking, and NU'EST couldn't even complain about it.

L.O..Es trended ""Pledis protect your artists"" [protest](https://twitter.com/BeenziMino/status/1069925432319852544) and asked for the cancellation of said hi-touch and they stuck post-it notes to the company's building and then came to clean them off once Pledis confirmed it would be cancelled. Instead of changing the rules of the event, they cancelled it and now the Japanese fandom is rightfully upset as well, they waited to see and meet their faves for a long time and they were so close to doing it, only for it to be cancelled last minute. for more info about this mess you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a2qa6x/loves_protest_pledis_sudden_announcement_of/)

Another issue was in regards to SEVENTEEN's extreme sasaeng situation, and how Pledis isn't doing enough or anything at all to deal with the problem, which is the truth. There have been so many reports of sasaengs following the members to private outings, events, airpots, unannounced schedules, following them around in cars, not allowing them any privacy whatsoever and yet the company is still letting it slide, and Carats are rightfully upset about it.

This is a [thread](https://twitter.com/getoutsasaeng_/status/1065976434131296256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1065976434131296256&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fonehallyu.com%2Ftopic%2F747570-pledis-in-hot-water-with-three-of-their-groups-fandoms-this-weeks%2F) talking about one particular stalking incident in which a member of the group, Hoshi, even came out of the restaurant he was dining in to address the sasaengs and their behavior and ask them to stop following them around.

But the biggest mess, or the one that caused most outrage, happened most recently, and it's the channel merging situation that Pledis has gotten themselves into. They have created an [event](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtkQNF2UcAAHcwC.jpg) asking fans to subscribe to their official account in exchange for signed polaroids of their artists. They started releasing teasers on the company channel, instead of individual artists channels.

Fans fear that the channels of their groups will not be used in the same way anymore, which really upset Carats in particular, because SVT's channel has 3 million subscribers due to their own hard work and effort and their fans have a lot of love for it, since it has been used and cherished for many years. The official channel for all artists has less subscribers than the one belonging to the group.

The biggest fear is that the views will be even more divided than they already are, since Pledis uploads all of SEVENTEEN's videos to the group's channel, and the videos are also uploaded to 1theK. I've seen no proof that the individual artists channel will be deleted or messed with, this seems like a move to garner more subscribers to their PLEDIS ENTERTAINMENT channel gone wrong.

Fans seemed to have assumed too much and jumped the gun on this one. Being upset that the company is using their artists, who they manage, to promote themselves and boost the popularity of their channel isn't invalid, but I also don't think it's worth trending multiple angry hashtags over the situation assuming only the worst (but the worst isn't impossible, considering that it's Pledis that we're talking about, so I get where people are coming from). They didn't do this to SEVENTEEN, they used NU'EST W teasers for the promotion andL.O..Es weren't that upset at the situation, but Carats made the situation about their faves somehow.

887,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-12-8,2018,12,8,13,a47pon,self.kpop,December 2018 Town Hall Follow-up - Rule Changes,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a47pon/december_2018_town_hall_followup_rule_changes/,SirBuckeye,1544244224,"Welcome to the Town Hall follow-up post for December 2018. Thank you to everyone who [participated in the thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a23l6m/town_hall_december_2018/)  Thanks to your feedback, we'd like to announce a few changes and decisions that resulted from it. These changes are effective immediately.

#### 1. Charts and Achievements will move to a weekly thread.

You guys came through loud and clear that there are too many achievement posts.  Beginning next Friday there will now be a weekly ""Charts and Achievements"" post that will compile all of the achievements and chart placings for the previous week.  If we miss some, you will be able to add your faves' achievements to the thread as well.  

The primary result of this change is that **most chart and achievement posts are now banned**.

* YouTube MV view milestones - **BANNED**
* Certified All-Kills and PAKs - **BANNED**
* Physical sales milestones - **BANNED**
* Brand reputation rankings - **BANNED**
* All broken records for views, sales, streaming, charting, etc. - **BANNED**

However, there are **some exceptions that will still be allowed.**

* The first win on a Music Show for each song. - **ALLOWED**
* A new highest ranking for an *artist* on the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200, US iTunes Top 100, UK Singles Chart, UK Album Chart - **ALLOWED**
* GaOn Triple Crown (First time for an artist only) - **ALLOWED**
* RIAJ Certifications (First time for an artist only) - **ALLOWED**
* Other awards given to artists, songs, or companies such as ""Rookie of the Year"", ""Song of the Year"", Award Nominations, YouTube Play Buttons, etc. - **ALLOWED**

Two things to keep in mind.  First, the banned stuff isn't going away entirely.  You can still find that information and discuss it in the new weekly ""Chart and Achievements"" thread that will be posted on Fridays.  Second, we feel that these exceptions are still newsworthy enough on their own that they should get their own thread.  Basically, if an artist gets an actual award for something, it's okay to post, but if it's just some arbitrary number that they've crossed, it's not, even if it's a new record.

Why are we making this change?  The first reason is that there are too many achievement threads.  You guys are tired of seeing them and so are we.  The second reason is that the comments are either ""YASS My Faves Did THAT!"" or a flamewar with anti-fans.  This is predictable, boring, and unhealthy.  We hope that banning these thread will help further our goal of reducing toxicity and hostility on the subreddit as well as keeping the front page fresh with the content you want to see.

#### 2. OP can answer their own question in a comment.

We will now allow posters to provide answers to their own question in a comment instead of the parent post.  This will help generate more discussion about OPs answers instead of just having them ignored.   **Submitters must still answer their own question** either in the parent or in a comment or the thread will be removed.  If you don't have an answer for your own question, then you should probably post it in r/kpophelp.  We don't want the subreddit to become /r/AskReddit or get flooded with low-effort questions.  We want discussion posts to be interesting and engaging and deliver more in-depth discussion than other forums or social media.  Please help us achieve that by submitting thoughtful topics that are unique and interesting.

#### 3. Movie trailers with idols are still banned.

Feedback in the Town Hall was mixed on this issue and mods don't want to open a door that may have more behind it than we're anticipating.  There are a lot of idols and former idols appearing in movies and webdramas and they could all have multiple trailers.  We still allow the news that an idol will be appearing in a movie to be posted, so if one of your faves lands a movie role, you'll know about it here.  If you want to follow the movie more closely, you can do so in the group subreddit or r/kdrama.  In the end, this is a music subreddit, not a movie subreddit.  **One exception** to this is if the movie is about the actual group or idol such as the recent BTS and TWICE movies as well as any future documentaries or biopics about the industry or artists.  These will be allowed.

**There are no other rule changes at this time.**  You can view the [complete subreddit rules here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules)  Thank you again for your feedback.  The next Town Hall will be on March 1st, 2019.  If you would like to give feedback before then, you can [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop) to us any time.

It seems that most people here are against San E regarding his recent actions. The guy has done some stupid &amp; questionable things in the past (e.g. Irene incident), and if his song was truly satire, his execution was poor. I'm not writing this to assert my views on you, I just wish people would stop immediately jumping on the train and conform to the popular opinions here without looking at what happened and thinking for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

What I mean by this:

* /r/CronoDroid wrote a very nicely compiled summary of what happened. Point 7 of the comment talks about San E's explanation post to his song ""Feminist"", but also adds ""Nobody buys it"". While /r/CronoDroid's views &amp; opinions are to be respected, I fear that comments like ""Nobody buys it"" discourages people from actually reading San E's explanation and judging it for themselves. I wish people would read through the lyrics, the explanation, and think about the contradictions to judge what views San E holds, rather than just buying someone else's opinion. That being said, if you read through the lyrics, explanation, thought about it and decided on a view, your views and opinions should be respected and I respect that. If it's different from what San E intended it to be, that's his fault for poor execution.  
* SBS recently reported news that clearly intentionally framed him. They took an excerpt of San E calling out extreme feminists, and reported to make it sound like San E was calling out feminists. This is just wrong from SBS, but **I worry that this isn't exclusive to just SBS**. There are a lot of criticisms of San E speaking out at the Brand New concert, but from this concert footage you can see that many fans were clearly behaving extremely, throwing things at him, inappropriate messages, verbal sexual harassment, etc.. 

Whatever views you form or have are to be respected, but I wish it was one that you formed after looking at things yourself, rather than just immediately conforming to the popular opinion (which often, is from someone no smarter than yourself). This was particularly a big issue during the previous presidential election, many people were frustrated by it, and it frustrates me that many people blindly repeat it.If anyone has any thoughts other on this, I'd appreciate a respectful &amp; civilized discussion.Thank you for reading my long post.. hope you have a good day today. :)

&amp;#x200B;

\----

Also, another thing I want to mention related to this is that it's important to distinguish between extreme feminism and feminism in Korea. These extreme feminists are often referred to as Womad / Megal (short for Megalia). While these extreme feminists refer to themselves as feminists, their views often misalign with what we consider feminism to be. I wanted to mention this in case there were any misunderstandings about criticism towards extreme feminism in Korea.",27,1,False,self,,,,,

First of all the level there was surprisingly low? I think I skipped a part but I only thought 2 dance groups actually danced impressively, the rest were butchering moves and doing them out of sync or too slowly and it was just not pretty. It wasn't even entertaining enough that I'd like to keep watching.

So those two groups I liked were Russia and Vietnam and they didn't win? There was like, I don't remember, a European girl group who got 3rd place, which is cool they were pretty good, and 2nd place went to Nigeria?? Like I'm sorry but they were 1# at butchering the dance. They could do flips but I know the dance for fire and I couldn't even tell the moves, they were just not good enough at dancing. I don't exaggerate when I say their dancing was absolutely not worth a stage. (And I'm sorry for being harsh, I know they're actual people who worked hard for it. The level just isn't enough imo)

So I'm really confused. Does anybody else feel that way? Does anybody know what makes the judges make such odd choices?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Groups with an asterisk have not been officially confirmed as disbanded by their companies, but it's pretty safe to assume they're dead. Also, if I missed anything, please feel free to comment them below and I'll try to add them in?

&amp;#x200B;

What disbandment are you most sad about? I'm both sad and happy about Stellar, they were a great group with great music but their company was terrible to them so I'm glad the members have been able to escape that. Who do you predict will be next in 2019? I'm thinking we'll see the end of T-ara, as sad as it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Which groups do you think had so much more potential? I think Fiestar could've been great at a larger company with better management.

I made a similar post to this last year, outlining the disbandments throughout 2017. It did really well, so I thought I'd make a follow up post for 2018!

Groups with an asterisk have not been officially confirmed as disbanded by their companies, but it's pretty safe to assume they're dead. Also, if I missed anything, please feel free to comment them below and I'll try to add them in?

What disbandment are you most sad about? I'm both sad and happy about Stellar, they were a great group with great music but their company was terrible to them so I'm glad the members have been able to escape that. Who do you predict will be next in 2019? I'm thinking we'll see the end of T-ara, as sad as it is.

Which groups do you think had so much more potential? I think Fiestar could've been great at a larger company with better management.

I wanted to compile a list of songs that I'd personally forgotten existed until I found them again and remembered how much I loved them!  I feel like these songs still really hold up today even by today's standards.  Most if not all of these songs are more upbeat since that's what I'm personally a fan of.

#[Son Dam Bi - Dripping Tears](https://youtu.be/rNIxcEgxfB8)

I was obsessed with this song (that piano tho) when it came out, and I loved the choreography in the chorus (where she simulates the tear dripping down her face).

#[Kan Mi Youn - Paparazzi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI83vv_-H74)

Super catchy!  I linked the dance version of the music video since it seemed much better quality (plus I love the dance).  This one might be more popular than the others in this list.

#[CHI-CHI - Longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A27or-uqPiA)

I may have a soft spot for slightly sad songs with a beat.  This gives me the same feelings as the Son Dam Bi song, wistful with longing.

#[Narsha - Bbi-Ri-Bop-A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FxBcxQ34Yw)

Ugh, what a good song.  I love the video too, the sets are all great and the atmosphere is so creepy but awesome.  I wish Narsha released more songs like this (or just more songs in general ).

#[NS Yoon-G - Reason To Become a Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysnUHXksic8)

This song is so fun.  That pop-rock chorus is everything (also she's gorgeous ugh).  I love the mix of slightly-orchestral ah's in the background with the guitar wailing away.

#[Seung Yeon - Guilty](https://youtu.be/2_WIuI5VZKA)

You all may remember her from KARA, and I love this rock-y orchestra-y slightly melancholy number she put out!  I love the scenery in the video as well.

#[EvoL - We are a bit different](https://youtu.be/187oF0LI5QQ)

People labeled them as ""another 2NE1"" because of their more ""badass"" rather than ""girly"" aesthetic when they first came out I think, but I wish they got more support because this song is so good.

#[KAHI - Come Back, You Bad Person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s5Q_aln1zQ)

Again, loving the piano on top of the harder synths and beat.  If I recall this was Kahi's first release after leaving After School (please correct me if I'm wrong)!  I love the ""HEY!"" section right before the second chorus.
___

There are tons I left out, so here's a couple more:

[Jewelry - Hot &amp; Cold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp75Xs4wSx0)

[Rania - Just Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCVU4lR-Gsk)

[Andamiro - Hypnotize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGigcMweiaE)

They have fewer lovey dovey songs on the whole, and some kick-ass breakup ""I don't need you"" songs (Back 2 U, 100). They also have some pretty nuanced, introspective, personal songs about regret (Yestoday) or the drill of daily life (My Van).

I don't follow NCT Dream as much, but I like how many of theirs are about youth (Go, We Young, We Go Up). 

So do your groups have notable patterns/themes in their lyrics? I'm especially interested in girl groups, since I don't like how many of their lyrics revolve around another person or talking to a hypothetical male listener, even if it's supposed to be a badass sorta song. Keep in mind that I might be biased, since I don't always look up lyrics if I hear a lot of indicators that it's another love song. ",80,1,False,self,,,,,

Theres one MV where someone ruffles her bangs and theres some slight forehead exposure, but otherwise her hair has never changed. I like the bangs on her a lot thoughshe pulls them off so well.

Some idols like Jinyoung and D.O. are known for refusing to dye their hair, so no matter what weird colors their groupmates get, theyre always black haired. Similarly, some idols like Taeyong and Jinsoul are known for always keeping their hair in a dyed color.

I also dont know anything about makeup, but is it just me or does LE always have heavy eye makeup on? She definitely has some kind of look that makes her look unique.",188,1,False,self,,,,,

As we know in the West, the #metoo movement picked off after Harvey Weinstein was outed and successfully removed from his position. 

Naturally, for celebs being right in the centre of the Entertainment industry, and with more companies being exposed, we know see more and more it's really about power and control behind the scenes of what we don't see, the really dark side instead of the rainbows and ageyo they portray. 

Image sells, and this is what the Korean public (in actual fact, the world) consumes. One stark contrast is that it's really jarring to me that there is such a stark opposite between the reality (that we may never know) of what they face and the pure, cute, wholesome image and the bubbly songs these artistes are made to perform.

I saw 2016's wasn't good so maybe the sudden level jump was this year is why it's so unnoticed for its level.

It's like Eurovision except for Kpop cover groups. The best 12 representatives from different countries all around the world (out of 90 participating countries in 2018) get chosen to compete in Kpop dancing/singing, and some of it is incredible. Big recommend, especially for this group in the pics called East2West who danced BTS as girls to show that girls can do strong dances and dang killed it (1:06:00 on the youtube full show)

There's a national competition in each country and the winner there goes on and competes internationally against all the other countries' winners. Then, the top 12 country representatives get chosen to perform in the big event. It's exciting because it's not easy even to get there, and if you have, your country's name is out there as one of the top countries as for Kpop cover groups.

Basically if you like dance covers or world competitions (I like the multicultural interaction) I recommend this, it was an exciting watch.

A short introduction for those who dont know me: u/jolaurence is the name and NCT is the group I pretty much actively follow. I live and work in Seoul and have been doing NCT promotions for almost two years now. [Next month marks 2 years of this long ass ride] The bias is of course Johnny and I only really know how SM does their Prerecs. But now even the groups are starting to differentiate how they do Prerecs. It is an interesting time my friends. Also forgive me for I am on mobile and there could be typos. 

This fan account will be different as it will be more so a play by play of how long you sometimes wait for a music show and what happens inside a music show. Each group/company has a different method from what I understand still. Since I only follow NCT, I can only say the from my own experience.

SM does not have fan cafes. Instead, each group has a notice board. The notice went up around noon when I was at work for Saturdays Prerec. I had made dinner plans for that night so I knew I would be at the notice later than I normally do. I followed the List Girls twitter for the day and stayed up to date with the numbers given out. 

With SM, we have a tier system. My tier is N1. To be N1 you need the follow: your ID, the Cherry Bomb and Regular fan cards, a NCT lightstick, and the Regulate album. Each tier has different requirements and mine is the highest one. Theres two check in processes.

The first one was Saturday morning at 7:30 on the freezing cold. My check in number was lower than I expected. We all got in our lines, showed them our phones, and then froze to death. The official check in with support started at 8:30 but you really shouldnt leave the area due to not knowing when support will arrive. Since there are many groups that gather for MuCore, each group has their own spot to meet at. Sometimes a few groups are lucky and get to have their check in at the MBC Building. Luck was not on the Seasonies side. Yet. 

After a while, support came and we took out our stuffs. My phone died it was so cold. It died folks. We were freezing. As more support staff arrived, they started giving us our tiers and then decided to give numbers right away because it was so cold. When the support lady got to my row and gave me my number, I was legit shocked. 

Theres one major theory going around over why not so many of us tried this weekend: the cold. It really was cold. But for this time, for the second time ever for me with MuCore, I would be N1 standing. Being able to do standing for MuCore is very rare for me. And to be able to do it for the goodbye stage for Simon Says, it was a blessing. 

Around 9:10, we all gathered again and got into our tier lines. For this Prerec, all N1 would be standing. Super, super rare occasion. Also, I found out the capacity for MuCore and standing is around 150-160. After they signed our fan card, and we waited in the cold, they announced to us that they would be bringing us inside to watch a Prerec for two other groups. Usually they do this to make the audience more full for filming and also to help support the artists. 

Some artists dont have that many fans. Those who were N2 and down were slowly brought in to watch a Prerec before the N1 standings were brought in so I dont know who it was. After that Prerec was finished, they brought us in. We were told no lightsticks in as we would be watching Laboum. Their fans were all standing in the front and I want to say it was around 20 or 30 people but Im not even sure. The number was really low. We clapped for them each time they finished a take. [Side note: ZN though. Shes beautiful. Really beautiful. Please, send help. I fell in love.]

After Laboum ended, their fans left standing and we all moved up while the rest of N1 was brought in. It was finally time for Simon Says. 

The boys did one rehearsal and two takes. Honestly, they looked really, really tired. They have been working so hard lately and its been showing. SM really needs them to rest but sadly they wont. Theres the year end shows coming up as well as 127s Japan tour. 

Before the first official take, when Mark went on stage he kept chanting Yo or something so we responded back. Before the second take, Taeyong decided to start with his arm exposed. We screamed. Who are you and wha have you done to Taeyong even though I really cannot complain. 

I actually ended up standing next to one of my friends during Prerec. Shes Haechan biased. So we kept screaming when our boys came on while doing the fanchants. We also both kept being broken over by Doyoung. 

The boys hardly ever make mistakes so they usually finish their Prerecs pretty quick. Im sure if you watched MuCore clips, you saw how they did. 

Now, for this comeback let me just say this: Johnny nailed it. First of all, Center parts. Just. Center. Parts. Also, from my overall consensus from seeing the stage 3 times, everyone loves Haechan. Everyone. He always shines with Dreamies but this time, there was more. I cannot complain. Kid deserves everything.

At the end of the Prerec, they all thanked us. Taeyong said that it was sad it was the last stage for Simon Says. I was sad too. It went by so fast. They said their greeting and we all waved goodbye to that, knowing it was the last time we would see Simon Says unless they do it for a year end show. 

My friend and I left with the rest of standing and then waited outside for the rest of our friends. 

Now, what I am going to tell you all is very important. Very, very important. And it is honestly a huge shock for people. There arent that many English speaking foreigners who support NCT over here in Korea with promotions. Concerts and festivals are different from promotions as are fansigns because promotions include music shows. From my own experience, promotions are generally music shows and fansigns, with sometimes festivals or events out of the country happening around that same time of promotions. 

Like I have said, I have been doing this for almost 2 years. Over that time, only a few of us have been doing it since Limitless era. Im friends with all of them. While we have gained more English speaking foreigner fans over here since Empathy era, most are just here for exchange for a few months and arent here long term. It feels strange knowing that is there reality when they are getting bigger globally, slowly. But there truly arent that many English speaking foreigner fans here. 

This is of course an open invitation that if you do stan NCT and will be here in Korea, you can contact me about how to do promotions. However, I will be very honest with you on how it all works. 

Anyway, enough about that. Its been great seeing the growth of 127 since Limitless and Im excited to see their future. Farewell Simon Says era. ",12,1,False,self,,,,,

**Leaving aside if idols are acting all the time or not or if everything is scripted behind the camera**; do you think you really don't know the real person behind the idol you like? I strongly believe a big reason many idols are beloved by many for a long time is because they're honest to their fans (as much as they can), not necessarily that you can get to know them truly as you can with a person IRL.

For example, seems like **Binnie and Jiho from Oh My Girl** hardly interact with each other, doesn't seem like they have the same vibe or humor and it seems they're just in good terms as members of the same group and nothing more. BUT they have 2 of the funniest vlive streams of the group, they have such a great chemistry there and yet they have only shared time in those two streams alone. After the second one where Jiho applies some exuberant makeup to Binnie, I started thinking there's so much more I don't know about them, even though I've watched like 98% of the content they have released (streams, sketchbook, behind the camera, making of, etc etc)

And it seems to me like it's getting worse with each passing year.

For example, here are some plaigarism aaccusations I've seen gain traction online just in the past week alone:  (keep in mind that I'm an Army and tend not to stray outside of that fandom online outside of this sub, this isn't meant to target anyone in particular it's just what I happened to see).

- a shot from a photoshoot in which a member of Bts is sitting in front a car with the license plate next to his head, which is apparently similar to a shot from Kokobop in which a license plate also appears.

- A tweet with tens of thousands of likes and retweets claiming that Bts plaigarized Exo's Olympics performance at the MMA's because they both drew from traditional Korean influences. Because apparently being Korean is just a concept and only one group can do it at a time lol

- people getting angry at someone for ""copying"" and making an edit of Bts in a Fenty ad because apparently Kai was involved with Fenty somehow? This is the one that prompted me to make this post, it was just so ridiculous but still somehow managed to get traction and thousands of retweets.

- This isn't even mentioning the wider trend of Bts being falsely accused of plaigarism basically throughout their entire career, and often for reasons even more stupid than those I've listed above.


And yet, when ACTUAL potential plagairism is brought up (not gonna use any example here I don't want this to turn into an argument) people will fight tooth and nail about it not being true. Art or music being lifted, almost wholesale in some cases, from other artists is generally not treated very seriously. This baffles me considering how so many kpop fans will scream plaigarism because of shit like hair color. Why is this a thing so prevalent in kpop fandom?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

I certainly wouldn't dedicate a K-Pop song to a girl I was going out with for example, however if I knew that she wouldn't see it as weird and would be open to it I'd like to dedicate her [Super Junior - Lovely Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygeO7S7tk9w).

&amp;#x200B;

**What 3rd gen songs (2011-present) would you have loved to see performed by 1st gen (1992-2003) and 2nd gen (2003-2010) idols (including sub-units and soloists)?**

&amp;#x200B;

I regularly daydream about what it would be like if my favorite 3rd gen tracks were produced for my 1st &amp; 2nd gen faves.

For example, I recently re-watched G-IDLE's [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wMEY_CWkdQ) of Lee Hyori's U Go Girl, and it got me thinking... I can only imagine how blown away I would be if the almighty Lee Hyori performed HANN- I can just picture her coy, villainous, femme fatale vibes (circa [Bad Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9wQhuxs5fA)) blending seamlessly with the powerful and solemn femininity of [HANN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arQ0kVtfC48). I feel that it would be extremely entertaining and cohesive, despite not being her usual style.

Examples of impossible performances that would make me melt if they happened:

&amp;#x200B;

***4Minute*** *version of* ***Black Dress*** *by CLC, or* ***Get It*** *by PRISTIN V*

***SNSD*** *debut lineup version of*  ***Remember Me*** *by Oh My Girl, or* ***Not That Type*** *by Gugudan*

***SHINee*** *version of* ***BABY*** *by Astro, or* ***Take Me Higher*** *by A.C.E*

***Infinite*** *version of Energetic by Wanna One, or* ***Blood Sweat and Tears*** *by BTS*

***T-ARA*** *version of* ***Crush*** *by Weki Meki, or* ***I Mean*** *by UNI.T*

***9 Muses*** *debut lineup version of* ***La Vie en Rose*** *by IZ\*ONE, or* ***The Boots*** *by Gugudan*

*SISTAR version of* ***Oh! My Mistake*** *by April, or* ***Between Us*** *by Laboum*

***Brown Eyed Girls*** *version of* ***I Knew It*** *by SONAMOO, or* ***I Love You*** *by EXID*

***2NE1*** *version of* ***Wind Flower*** *by Mamamoo, or* ***You're My Girl?*** *by KHAN*

***f(x)*** *version of* ***honestly anything at this point*** *(jokes aside, I fantasize about Amber rapping Irene's part in* ***Red Flavor****)*

I start to think about this because I have seen a lot of people saying EXO is in the end of the second generation or is in the start of the third. And a lot of people now is saying that the third is ending.

However, the Wannable told her to deliver it to Wanna One's Jisung. Hyunjin, now looking flustered and embarrassed, gave the flower to LOONA's Jinsoul who later went to give the flower to Jisung.

There is a hashtag going around but Orbits are a small fandom so it probably won't get much attention.

Please don't use other Artists like that, Hyunjin looked really happy to receive a flower.

The '**2018 Mnet Asian Artist Awards**'is under fire for unfairness.

On December 10, **the '2018 MAMA Premiere in Korea'** took place at DDP in Seoul. At the event, the project girl group **IZ\*ONE** from Mnet's '**Produce 48**' won the '**Best New Female Artist**.'

However, on the online votes for 'Best New Female Artist',**Cube Entertainment** girl group**(G)I-DLE**took 1st place by taking over 50% of the votes. Meanwhile, IZ\*ONE only gained 17.64% of the votes.

&amp;#x200B;

The online vote is not the only factor that determines the winner. Multiple factors includingthe expert evaluation, album sales, MV views, live broadcast votes, and more aretaken into consideration. However, **netizens believe** (G)I-DLE still should'vebeen the winneras they had a major lead in the online votes.

To this, a rep from Mnet stated,*""It's true that (G)I-DLE gained many votes online,but they fell behind in album sales.""*The rep emphasized,*""There were no manipulation or (unfair) intervention in the awards.""*",69,1,False,self,,,,,

Ive always noticed a difference in music styles between the Big 3 but I couldnt quite put my finger on it. Im hoping you people way smarter than me on this Kpop subreddit can explain it :) 

But here are my observations/guesses:

SM

I think SM by far has the best vocalists and that shines through in their title tracks. Ex: Universe by EXO, Timeless by Jaehyun,Doyoung, and Taeil, Really Bad Boy by Red Velvet (at least it seems to me that it shows their voices pretty well lol)

YG

YG artists are really strong in rap. Across the board BB,iKon,Winner,BP all have strong rap parts in their title tracks. 

JYP

I dont think JYP artists are the strongest vocalists or rappers but I would dare to say their songs are really memorable and catchy. Anything by Twice and some GOT7 songs, older groups like Wonder Girls and Miss A.",96,1,False,self,,,,,

Yesterday I was downstairs in my hostel and there was this guy having problems communicating the lady on duty (I'm an international student in Ukraine and I've been here for a while but he seems new) and when I looked at him I was shook.

I kid you not I was looking at someone that could pass as Hyungwon's Indian cousin.

Like skinny. Yeah. Hyungwons priminent facial features? Yeah. Not as tall, but that slow-ish/laid back way/demeanor (don't mean this in a bad way) Hyungwon has? Yes.

I was staring like an idiot. Tried helping at a point and butchered my numbers in Russian (where I live, a lot of people speak russian and that's what I learnt) while trying to talk to the lady - though that might not have been due to my stunned state but my rusty language skills. BUT STILL! I was so taken aback! Lol

So in line with the topic I'll drop 2 other instances - both happened on the bus. I heard this non kpop song - idk the name but it's used to depict weird sexy moods in varieties etc. I think Carats will be more familiar with it, the lyrics go ""all that I have is all that you give me~"" smth like that. The first time was on the radio and the second it was someones phone ringing and im virtually wired to laugh when I hear the song cuz its played when some weird thing is happening. And there I am smiling like an idiot again on the bus, with no one to relate to.

I was hoping one of you guys on here would recognize what the song is.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember the music video starts with a female showing up to school late and having to write something on the chalk board. She proceeds to get into a fight with other females in school and ends up throwing a chair through the classroom window. While all of this is happening, her admirer watches on and he is clearly in a different cliche than her.

&amp;#x200B;

He gets picked on by gang type students and the female he admires stops them (they clearly know her). They go on date eating food and whatnot. The gang type students beat the admirer up because he's hanging out with their girl. The girl decides not to hang out with the admirer anymore for his safety. The video ends with the admirer going to the gang's hangout at a pool hall and  he proceeds to fight three or four of them for the honor of the girl he likes. The gang overpowers him and as he is about to hit him, he says in Korean something to the effect ""Do it!"". The gang decides to just leave him in his humility.

&amp;#x200B;

The video ends with the girl and the admirer smiling.

While I've been enjoying their songs, I've started to notice some things about the fandoms which sort of annoy me.

 - There are a lot of comments on Youtube under music videos telling the fanbase to stream and to achieve certain goals by the end of the year or month. I heard streaming is to help boost the MVs recognition and presence, but don't know how much it has actually helped groups become known in the western world. This probably happens to some extent in western music, but the amount of emphasis of streaming is quite shocking really.

- The amount of attention idols get themselves instead of their works. I know artists and groups get a lot of attention themselves as people, but I don't see as much appreciation of their music than their personal looks. If I look at the reaction videos of fans, I see quite a few freaking out at the sight of their bias, while people who aren't into kpop as much focus on the music. There's more ""he/she is so hot"" and ""&lt;3[insert bias]"" than ""the beat drop is sick"" or ""this line gave me chills"". There's like more focus on the idol than the music, which I don't think is exactly the best way to appreciate them for what they do.

- The mentality that people can't criticize kpop artists/groups' works just because they put hard work into it. There's always going to be people who enjoy the music and those who don't. People saying that that certain groups' songs are good doesn't mean they are attacking the group. They just don't like it. Sure, people put a lot of work into things, and they deserve some appreciation for their hard work, but it doesn't necessarily mean that their songs are actually good. I'm sure many of you worked hard for things that you wanted, but just didn't end up getting it. If you verbalise your distaste in a song, the fandom will come rip you apart. Some people can be pretty aggressive.

This post is in no way directed at every one of you kpop fans out there, it's more of a general impression I got after browsing through Youtube for some time. I appreciate kpop artists for their works, and there are quite a few that I can really jam too. I just feel like there is a toxic mentality and attitude coming from certain fanbases out there.

So for those who have been around for a long time, what are your impressions of the kpop fanbase? Are the types of people I mentioned just a small part of the community who just so happens to be a lot more active?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Since we're coming to the end of the year Spotify has released their ""2018 wrapped"" thing along with providing everyone, or me at least, with a Playlist made by Spotify called ""tastebreakers"". I put it on and went back to browsing reddit, when the song ""no jam by Soul One, featuring Evo"" came on, and before a single word was said, I could just _tell_ that is was a Korean song based on the way the very first part of song was sung.

I am, in no way, trying to start a fan war. 

There is no point using brand ranking as a statistic when it is just about whoever has activity in that month. Obviously, if a group has a comeback in a month, they would have a higher brand ranking due to all the activities that they would have. 

Sure, I-DLE may have done better digitally, but IZ*One also outsold them physically by a huge margin. 

Although I-DLE won the votes by a large margin, voting isn't everything when it comes to deciding who wins. 

Keep in mind that compared to IZ*One, I-DLE's debut had less hype (imo). It's only natural that I-DLE has less albums sold. This is why I believe that the awards weren't as rigged as many put it. The ""Best of Next"" award is basically the equivalent of a ""Rising Star"" award. With K/DA and other projects, I-DLE obviously has had a lot of time to gain more and more hype throughout the year as well as fans. I'm sure their next comeback will do much much better than I am did, both physically and digitally.

Do feel free to correct me if you do not agree with any of my points.

This is in response to the growing disaster that seems to be the U.S OMG tour and the promoter JSJ entertainment. I mostly wanted to ask what were some of your experiences with JSJs previous tour that they ran with BAP and if have any words of warning/advice?

Ive heard a first hand account of someone getting screwed out of an expensive hi-Touch on the BAP tour because the promoter decided to cancel with no refunds given.  She commented that pre and post show were a chaotic mess. 

Also, just in the rollout of the OMG tour the following has happened: 
1. Meet &amp; greet tickets go on sale but reports of transactions not completing yet cards still being charged.
2. OMG reveals the dates and venues yet no on sale date for other three cities despite the California dates being on sale already
3. The Houston gig venue has no idea about the show being finalized. This is from a second hand account unlike the hi-Touch story above but according to a good source Stereo Live has no idea about the show, who Oh My Girl is or if anyone has even contacted them nevermind actually booked a date.
4. First California date went on sale with some implied  VIP benefit for the top ticket tiers which turns out not to be true. Any VIP packages must be purchased separately. This means nearly $400 for a close seat and m&amp;g for a smaller group. Worth it for some but deal killer for filling seats for a lesser known group.

While it's not my favorite RV title track (literally nothing has been able to top Red Flavor), I do like it. However, one thing that makes the song a little hard to listen to is the fact that they're singing so high. I'm not just talking about the screams, but it sounds like Wendy and Seulgi are singing higher than necessary in the chorus. I'm also not a fan of Seulgi's voice, but I don't mind so much when she sings low. When she sings high it's kind of grating to me--I'm not trying to attack her singing ability; I'm just stating my personal, subjective opinion. I think if the key to RBB were lowered, I would like the song even more. And maybe one fewer scream would be nice too lol.

I love Happy by WJSN, but there's just this one part that happens a few times where whoever's singing the ""Wae"" (I can't remember lol but I'm sure y'all know what I'm talking about) gets bombarded with squeaky autotune or some other effects, and that one part just really annoys me. Cut it, please.

Random English monologues are pretty hit or miss with me, but sometimes they're just lol. Did Yoona really have to say ""I like to party!"" in All Night? Was Mina's segment in Yes or Yess truly necessary? We can't forget Tiffany's English intros either--although iconic and legendary, also hilarious.

So first off, I want to thank everyone for their support of my previous [where are they now PD48 thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a366ik/where_are_they_now_produce_48_edition_a_status/)

As mentioned in that thread, I'll be doing these for both Season 1 and Season 2 of Produce 101 to complete the trilogy (and to hype up the 4th season slated for 2019!)

So first things, it's been over ***2 years*** since the first season of Produce 101 finished airing (the finale aired in April 2016). It's crazy to think how big the Produce brand has gotten and changed the landscape of K-pop.

With that said, let's get an update on our girls who participated on the first season of the show.

As in my PD48 thread, anything not official confirmed via a label/contestant is either speculation or rumor and will be marked with  an ""\*"" to note that.

If y'all see an update about a contestant or something I missed, please feel free to let me know and I'll update the OP!

**Additional Things/Rumors to Note:**

* IBI was a project group formed under LOEN Entertainment with five contestants who placed in the Top 22 after the completion of *Produce 101*. The members were Lee Haein, Kim Sohee,  Yoon Chaekyoung, Lee Suhyun, and Han Hyeri. The group was de facto disbanded in 2017.
* Yoon Chaekyoung and Cho Shiyoon initially debuted in 2012 as a member of Puretty, though they competed on PD101 as trainees due to the group disbanding in 2014.
* Lee Suhyun was slated to debut in HYWY's five member girl group DayDay in 2017 with The Ark alum Kim Minju. However, shortly after releasing teasers for the group, HYWY abruptly [cancelled the debut.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/77mua9/hywy_entertainment_announces_girl_group_dayday/) No news/rumors have come out about her leaving the label after the group's cancellation so her label is noted as officially being HYWY.
* Ng Sze Kai (Shin) originally debuted as part of Canto-pop group [As One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_One_(Hong_Kong_band)) in 2012. She went on hiatus during the filming of PD101 and later returned to the group fulltime once she was eliminated.
* Heo Chanmi originally debuted in 2010 as a member of Co-Ed School. However, she competed in PD101 as a trainee due to the group getting disbanded in 2012. She recently was slated to debut in High Color after MIXNINE concluded in 2017, but the debut was [abruptly cancelled](https://www.allkpop.com/forum/threads/high-color-debut-when-heo-chanmi.165006/) after teaser photos were released.
* Hwang Insun has been active as a soloist since 2014.

1241,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-12-12,2018,12,12,8,a5ckn5,self.kpop,"San-E Controversy and this subreddit: Before downvoting, hear me out: Playing the devils advocate as a Korean Male",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a5ckn5/sane_controversy_and_this_subreddit_before/,brip2002,1544572581,"First and foremost, I think the most important aspect to understanding this controversy is understanding Korean culture. 

This video by DKDKTV summarizes it pretty well I think: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvrwpBRatho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvrwpBRatho)

But, just to sum things up a bit more:

\- In fact, Korean men and women are largely supporting San E for two main reasons: lashing out against Womad and radical feminism, and lashing out against fake, trashy media. 

\-&gt; Womad has been on the forefront of discussion for the past few weeks, if not months. They're essentially a group of extremely radical feminists (they post about wanting to kill guys, they post about a guy who had surgery and say they're sad he didn't die, they say men should be killed, etc) that are really tainting the image of feminism in Korea. 

\-&gt; Fake media has also been present since ages and San E's most recent song, Trash Journalist, sums up Korean public view pretty well.

* The opening quote is from a movie where the speaker is talking about the media and journalists, and how its fine to publish stuff, even if false or controversial, because the citizens are ""dogs and pigs"" and will eventually forget about it. 
* Journalists are bribed by entertainment companies to overly publicize their artists or criticize others.
* As clickbait, these trash journalists often take things way out of their context like they did with San E. 

&amp;#x200B;

So first, his concert. 

A lot of y'all are saying that his concert behavior and songs were what got him ""dropped"" from his label, but it isn't. 

His contract with his label was set to expire already and the concert was essentially a Goodbye stage for San E. 

In the concert, a lot of people held placards saying ""San E trash"", ""San E 6.9cm"" ""San E you're disgusting"" and even dolls thrown at him telling him to kill himself. 

In the concert, he said ""Womad, Feminist No, You're Ppl with mental illnesses"" calling these radical feminists as being ""crazy"". However, SBS and Korean media cropped out this footage and changed it to ""Feminists, you're ppl with mental illnesses"" which made it seem like San E was hating on feminism - what I think most ppl on this subreddit are saying. 

After, in his personal Youtube channel, he clarified this up and claimed that the media have tried to defame him and he gained lots more support from the Korean public, who's accustomed to the trash journalism a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing about Jerry K. 

I agree with the points he made in his song, but I don't think he is very qualified to talk about this issue judging from his past. A rapper named Don Malik was in Jerry K's label, and he was forced to apologize for assaulting an underage women. However, police investigations and security cameras showed that Don Malik was innocent, and that Jerry K forced him to apologize, take the blame, and leave the industry without fully investigating the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about the controversy about  San E and Korean opinion. Like before, the vast majority of women and men are supporting San E. 

San - E song also presents typical Korean men's comments. 

\- TBH, when I lived in Korea (I'm a teenager), I didn't really experience any discrimination or sexism. Girls were given equal opportunities and had the same chances for everything I did. 

\- There is increasingly more favoritism for women and viewing women as needing to be protected --&gt; women not going to third world countries for company work (overseas) and sending the men. 

\- This is why I think the general public is accepting of the pay gap - which is also in my opinion, not completely reliable. We have to consider the fact that in Korea, not many women take difficult positions (construction, mining, etc), increasing male workers. Similarly, like mentioned before, the companies don't send them to difficult overseas positions in dangerous countries (even in the government jobs this occurs) In my uncle's job at a Korean company with an overseas branch in Europe, there are two males and the rest are females. In south america, however, all are males with zero women working. 

\- This is also why women don't go to the military, but men have to. 

\- There used to be an employment bonus for men who have gone to the military, but this was abolished because of these feminist movements which have deemed to to be unfair. Now, however, there are great employment bonuses for women who have children.

Thank you to everyone who [participated in the follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a47pon/december_2018_town_hall_followup_rule_changes/) as well as [the original Town Hall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a23l6m/town_hall_december_2018/)

We got a lot of great feedback to the changes, and the follow-up thread [went really well.](https://i.imgur.com/1PZDwr7.gifv)  Mods were a bit surprised by the sudden reversal of opinion from the original thread.  It seems we may have gotten a little overzealous in our efforts to clean up achievement posts and moved too many things to the weekly thread.  Hopefully, we can find a middle-ground that will make more of you happy with the changes.  Here is our current proposal:

#### 1. More Achievements added to exceptions.

The following achievements will be added to the achievement exception list and will get their own thread.

* Perfect All-Kills - **ALLOWED**
* Physical Sales Milestones (First time for an artist only) - **ALLOWED**
* RIAJ **and RIAA** Certifications - **ALLOWED**
* A new highest ranking or for an *artist* **or reaching #1** on the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200, US iTunes Top 100, UK Singles Chart, UK Album Chart - **ALLOWED**  

Plus the ones that were already stated.  

* The first win on a Music Show for each song. - **ALLOWED**
* GaOn Triple Crown &amp; Certifications (First time for an artist only) - **ALLOWED**
* Other awards given to artists, songs, or companies such as ""Rookie of the Year"", ""Song of the Year"", Award Nominations, YouTube Play Buttons, etc. - **ALLOWED**

The following topics will be restricted to the weekly ""Charts and Achievements"" post.

* YouTube MV view milestones - **BANNED**
* Certified All-Kills - **BANNED**
* Brand reputation rankings - **BANNED**
* All broken records for views, sales, streaming, charting, etc. - **BANNED**
 
We realize this still won't please everyone, but pleasing everyone is not a realistic goal.  The goal is to reduce the number of trivial achievement posts that only serve as dick-measuring contests or an invitation for a fanwar.  We feel the majority of these stem from threads regarding some record being broken, so those will stay restricted to the weekly thread.  Mods will make an exception if an especially monumental record gets broken (like most albums sold ever), but otherwise new records will stay in the compilation thread.  

Remember that other charts and achievements will be posted in that thread so if you want more numbers about K-Pop, please tune in on Friday.  Stat geeks should also check out the [Two Weeks Later threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/search?q=title%3A%22Two+Weeks+Later%22&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;sort=new) which are always stuffed full of data and metrics.  You can also make your own ""Two Weeks Later"" discussion thread for your faves 13-17 days after their release.  Check out the existing threads for what kind of info you should include and let us know if you have any questions or need help.

We hope that users who were upset at the removal of some of these achievements will be happy to see them return, and we also hope that users who were sick of seeing achievement posts will be happy with what we have removed.  We will continue to monitor feedback and make changes in the future if warranted.  The next Town Hall will be on March 1st, 2019.  If you would like to give feedback before then, you can [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop) to us any time.

I know it's a holiday song but honestly views are really shocking to me video was uploaded 9 hours ago and has only 11k views. It's almost like they are a new nugu group from an unknown company.

After 2 years they are back as a group with almost zero attention. It feels like fans forgot about them as well. I have had this feeling for a while now - that Polaris don't really care about them too much. Their solos were pretty underrated as well.

2 years of not being active as a group is a big deal in kpop and only big names can do that.
I thought fans will be more hyped to see them again. I know many people who don't spend a lot of time on social media probably don't even know about their comeback. That's why good promotion is needed.

I don't really know what to think anymore about their situation. I feel like in the last 2 years they needed at least 3 comebacks badly just so they don't get forgotten. Solos didn't really give LC too much attention. 

I feel really sad for them because they are one of the best singers for me. They have Sojung who could probably be a well known soloist with the right promotion.

Do you feel like their company is kinda giving up on them? And that 2 years of being non active as a group made them lose fans or at least made them kinda forgotten in the kpop world? Especially now when we have so much new groups, people find other active groups and forget about groups that are not that active.

A way of changing it up for both the performers and the fans. 

TWICE, for example, performing their songs (I'm using them as an example because I just finished watching their stage, I know there are others) today (tonight?) did some form of rearrangement with everything. DTNA gutted the second verse and had a different beat for the last chorus. What is Love? was similar, but had different girls singing different parts. Yes or Yes had the dance intro. A while ago when they were promoting Signal, they did like a Jazz remix version (that is honestly WAY better, and I like Signal).

I know everything there is to know and I won't be changing my mind.)

I have been an EXO-L since the hiatus between MAMA and XOXO. I've seen the members leave and I know what a member leaving or slowly phasing out looks like. 

I'm not mad at Lay for having a solo career because I support Kyungsoo as an actor and the other members doing things. I feel like Lay just has no interest in being in EXO anymore and should stop making excuses for not participating in their group comebacks. 

EXO have been presented to us as 8 for two years now and they never say that they're missing a member. (Yes, they've talked about Lay but not as an EXO member.) They seem to purposely say all members in reference to there only being eight of them. They never say ""all members except Lay."" It seems to me that they have accepted he doesn't want to be with them as a group anymore. 

I think the only reason Lay continues to say he is a member is because of his contract with SME and also because he would rather not rock the boat until he can quietly leave the group (as in, wait for contract to expire and leave.) I don't think he wants to leave the company, just EXO, but he can't because of contracts.

I mean they are the signatures of the awards shows. what is an award show without YG, JYP and SM groups?  
However, After watching the MAMA Japan and MMA I can say that the Big 3 groups are easily replaceable(at least this gen group). I thought the awards shows would be underwhelming, but it exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed those award season so much because I noticed groups that I didn't pay attention before or groups I never noticed were THIS talented. I'm not the only one too even Knetz noticed too. This MAMA was definitely diverse and everybody had a fair amount of performance time. Everyone had enough time to shine.

Just because I love an idol's voice, doesn't mean everyone else will like them too. And just because I don't like an idol's voice, doesn't mean everyone else will dislike them, either. Preferences are subjective, and disliking a voice doesn't necessarily mean that the singer has bad technique; it just means that that's not what you like.

I know this is probably sacrilegious as an EXO fan, but I really do not like Baekhyun's voice. I personally think that he sounds too boisterous, and I don't know why but something about his tone is off-putting. But do I think he's a terrible singer? Of course not; I'm not stupid. I respect him for his ability, but I also don't listen to solo stuff for a reason. It's also part of the reason why I only listen to the Chinese versions of Mama and What Is Love; Chen has one of my favorite voices in Kpop, so I prefer hearing him instead.

Nasally singers are hit or miss for me--I don't mind it with Jessica or Tiffany but do with Ros--and for the longest time, Seulgi swung back and forth between hit and miss. But after Bad Boy, I don't know what happened but I decided her voice was a miss. She sounds nice when she sings low like in Heart Stop with Taemin, but up high in RBB? Not for me. I will say though that I enjoy RV's overall blend; they're all kinda nasal but their different tones sound really nice together.

Anyway, there's a lot more, but those two are the only I can think of off the top of my head. I like them as people and respect them for their craft, so don't misinterpret me as being mean. So be honest and don't be afraid to share your own opinions.",17,1,False,self,,,,,

I mean this looks pretty well prepared.

I recall reading a few comments about how 2017 would've probably been a wonderful year for Seventeen but then Broduce/WannaOne happened (no shade is intended on WannaOne at all, I mean to say that their growth was so exponential and no one could've seen it coming)

 I feel like it mightve been written a while ago but kept to be performed close to the year end at MAMA to make a bigger impact. Unlike Boom boom in 2016, they performed what appears to be the full song, no?  Not to mention the huge change in OT13 concept. It was impactful. 

 Sort of like a strike while the iron is hot strategy. 
Lots of exposure, plus comebacks are rounding up (correct me if I'm wrong) 

It's left an imprint on people's minds.

Especially if they promote it or have a repackaged mini before their tour. 

What are some good/smart marketing strategies you've seen/would advice in the kpop industry and for what groups?

On a sidenote, seeing that SVT and Pristin are from the same company, I can't help but be amazed. ",14,1,False,self,,,,,

Anyways, I was hoping to get thoughts from my fellow Kpoppers (is that a term?) about what company they think has a good chance to have a standout 2019.

I live and die by JYP so Im pretty biased towards them. But I realize that Twice carries a lot of the burden of whether JYP has success or failure. So my pick is YG.

Blackpink really blew up this year with D4 and now with Jennies solo and the upcoming (hopefully) solo releases from the other members. I thought they were strong contenders for SOTY. I know Youtube views arent everything but the fact their MVs rack up so many views shows to me they have mass appeal worldwide and maybe that could translate to higher album sales,tours,etc if they get on a more regular comeback schedule

Sorry to Winner fans but I dont really know too much about the group lol. But I thought Everyday was a pretty solid comeback and Mino has had a really successful solo release. Im anticipating their upcoming comeback and world tour(they are coming to my city, Seattle!)

I dont really need to say much about iKon because everybody already knows they owned 2018. If they keep having years like this I think they could really be a force to be reckoned with because even though they are a BG, their digital performance rivals that of even the best GGs. At least Love Scenario that is. Well see how their next releases are

This post is going to discuss my viewpoint on Kpop and Korean culture that I have become to love over the past year. It is going to be long so if you read it thanks :D if you don't i understand completely

---

I am writing this for a reference for myself to look back on years later and see what I enjoyed.

---------

**Background:** I am a white 20 year old male Accounting student living in Southern California, I have lived in California my whole life and have never been to Korea. My music taste before listening ot Kpop consisted of EDM (Excision, 12th Planet, Zomboy) and rap (Logic, Kendrick, NF). My journey into Kpop started last December (2017)  and since then it has become a huge part of my daily life. I was also able to attend Kcon and the latest TwiceLand movie.

**Beginning:** I cant recall exactly how i started to find videos but I do remember that the first video that got me into Kpop was **[John Park - Thought of you] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLmOezNMPnY)** and to this day is still one of my favorite songs. Something about his voice brought me to love the song and ultimately made me look up more songs. The next big song that I landed on was **[BLACKPINK - Playing with Fire] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pdj4iJD08s)** and since then my love for the genre has grown daily.

---

***My Bias Groups***

+ **BLACKPINK**: BLACKPINK became the first group that i started to follow which was perfect at the time (Dec-Jan) because of the content that they would be uploading (BLACKPINK house) weekly which would keep me engaged in the group, let alone Lisa being Lisa. BLACKPINK was all i knew in the Kpop world for about the first month of me listening to korean music because I was so entrapped in all the content that I had missed and all the learning I had to do about the group. That ultimately was the downfall for me stepping away from the group though, the lack of content. Because of this i started searching for other music/groups within the industry.

+ **Twice**: After BLACKPINK came twice and since then Twice has taken over my life. Anyone Once who is reading this understands why they are so likable and adorable.  Since January I have been able to watch all their shows, variety show appearances, youtube videos, and most of their vlives since the beginning. I have also been able to collect all of their albums and alot of the magazine covers that they have been on. Twice has been a huge part in me being interested in Kpop and has one of the nicest fanbases that I have been apart of. Twice is still the only group that I ""Fanboy"" today and I think it will stay that way for a long time. 

---

***Music***

Kpop has allowed me to explore different types of music and different sounds than I would normally listen to and it has been eye opening to see what my preferences in music were in a language that I do not understand. 

The top 10 songs in order that I have found within the 1 year I have been listening are:

1.  [Kim Lip - Eclipse] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qJEoSa3Ie0)
2. [Exo - Monster] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSH-FVVtTf0)
3.  [NCT127 - Touch] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sHIq41sI-w)
4. [Pristin V - Get it] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z3iyydFevQ)
5. [Gugudan - The Boots] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3KSD5sI0OM )
6. [Twice - One in a Million] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYU5DS_2xcM)
7. [Dean - Instagram] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKyMIrBClYw )
8. [Sejeong - Flower Road] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKLKDJ1QsLs)
9. [Shine - Our Page] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psl-x_nw7TI )
10. [Eric Nam x Somi - You Who] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaG575r_Dyo )

[My Full Playlist in order most of when i found an artist or song] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtI8rwmFCp8PJaunnVPc9QepZmeL0sCzg)

I have come to like 246 songs accross 50~ artists as of December 15, 2018

---

***Korean Culture***

This is something that has been very interesting for me to experience over the course of a year. Seeing fan interactions and ""rules"" that the community or society has for the idols. 

+ Something that I will never understand is why there are very vocal fans that feel the need to put someone else down for their choice of music to listen to. This is something that you see a lot in the Kpop industry and i'm not sure if it is due to the amount of young teenagers that are the vocal majority on social media or if that is just how the industry has always been. When it comes to social media and voicing my opinion on artists, if it is negative I just don't say it. Nothing positive comes from it yet a majority of comments left anywhere are from another fanbase trying to degrade the work or accomplishment that another group has achieved. 

+ The other thing that I have found to be really interesting about the Kpop industry is the amount of authority or ""rules"" that have been made up by the fans that are ridiculous.  The main few that pop out as i'm typing this at 2AM are ""Dating scandals"" and ""they are being overworked"". The fans of this industry seem to feel like they own their favorite artist and as a collective think they can dictate how those artists should live their lives. It is actually disgusting the amount of shit that fans come up with when they don't like something. It is pretty much at the point to where if a fanbase doesn't like how an artists nails are painted, that that artist will get their contract terminated due to backlash, it is incredible. I have never seen anything like this. Yet again this could be due to the immaturity of the majority of consumers that the Kpop industry seems to attract. 

---

***Variety Shows***

+ Variety shows are a godsend to this community for the opportunity it gives groups to appeal and interact with their audiences and I think we should be thankful for that. Living in the United States the closest thing we have to this would be an artist going on the tonight show or something similar and having a 5 minute clip, but for the Kpop industry you typically get 2+ hours of content from a group for every comeback they might do (YG artists = 0 hours since they never come back). This content has been gold for me since i thrive for more content. 

My Favorite shows 

+ Knowing Brothers
+ Hello Counselor
+ Village Survival
+ The Genius - HIGHLY RECOMMEND

With my personalities being

+ Kim Hee-chul
+ Lee Soo-geun
+ Lee Sang-Min

---

***Closing***

+ Overall Kpop has let me join a world of music and entertainment that I never imagined I would be able to like due to language barrier and American social standards. As someone who is always lurking in the background of social media and never interacting it has shown me how ignorant and immature the fanbases of some of the most popular groups are which has been sad. I am looking forward to what music next year brings and what great things Kpop can achieve.

---

Yet again these are my own personal likes and thoughts that I wanted to put into writing to come back to in the future. I am sharing them to see how they compare to what others think and what others have experienced and to hopefully learn about some new groups and or shows that I have yet to listen to.

**WARNING: LONG TEXT POST AHEAD!!**

**Introduction**

Hello r/kpop! It has been about two months since I [last attended]( https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9pw0pe/fan_account_181020_red_velvet_redmare_in/) a K-pop concert at the Star Theatre :o Like before, I will attempt to recreate my experience in full prose. Thank you for reading!

Event date: Sat, 15 Dec 2018 (6pm)  
Venue: The Star Theatre, Singapore

*****

**Before the Concert**

The Singapore stop was announced sometime in September; ticket sales opened on 13 October. I got myself a Cat 3 ticket which cost SGD192 (= USD140 = GBP110), towards the back in the middle section of Circle 1, the theatre's lower circle. (Fun fact: This seat was right next to the one which I had for Redmare. Life is strange...)

For this concert, all three floors of the theatre were opened for a grand total of 5,000 seats! The stalls sold out within the first few hours of sales, while the second floor (that'd be Circle 1!) sold out within the first week. The third floor (Circle 2) sold out about two weeks prior to concert day. Seats with restricted view were made available soon afterwards, but I am unsure if they were eventually sold out too.

Sometime in October, we got both a [handwritten memo]( https://www.facebook.com/OneProductionSingapore/photos/a.166182410148917/1515419308558547/?type=3&amp;permPage=1) and a [video message]( https://www.facebook.com/OneProductionSingapore/videos/1001400666699075/) from IU!! This was when I knew that I would be called a Singaena (Singapore loves IU), heh.

*****

**Concert Day**

There were no merchandise sales :( Doors would be opened at 5pm, with the concert starting at 6pm. I arrived at the venue around five minutes past 4 to try and get a fancy [transparent fan]( https://www.facebook.com/sgheartiu/photos/a.365052393670181/1151813101660769/?type=3&amp;permPage=1) from Singapore Heart IU, the local fan union, but alas I was too late :( So I wound up with neither official goods nor fanmade goods. Well, I suppose it isn't a huge problem...
After a light dinner, I started queuing to enter the venue around 5.35pm; I got to my seat around ten minutes later.

**SETLIST**

[Thanks for compiling this, IUteamstarcandy!](https://twitter.com/IUteamstarcandy/status/1073923940324528128) (I'll just post this link for brevity's sake now, but I may convert this into text form later. We'll see.)

Notes:

* VCRs were played before the following songs: The Red Shoes (the concert's opening), Between the Lips (50cm), Twenty-Three, Marshmallow, and Through the Night. Of course there were outfit changes too! (I don't think I've missed anything here, but please let me know if I have...)
* Talk segments occurred before the following songs: dlwlrma, Good Day, Friday, Love, Gloomy Clock, The Story Only I Didn't Know, BBIBBI, Palette, Merry Christmas in Advance, You and I, Dear Name (part of encore 1), The Shower (part of encore 2), Heart (part of encore 2). (Same thing here; I apologise in advance if I've made any mistakes!)

*****

**The Concert**

The concert began at 6.05pm, right after they finished screening the MV for BBIBBI (which was part of pre-concert hype)! I will attempt to highlight things which I thought were out of the ordinary; I likely will not discuss the VCRs at length.

IU first appeared with a dark purple microphone in the outfit which she'd been wearing in the opening VCR, which I'd say excelled in how tongue-in-cheek it was! (Well, the VCR did tell us to ""prepare [our] lightsticks"", but majority of us made do with the finger lights given by the local fan union, as there were no merchandise sales. I don't think concerts outside Korea have lightstick synchronisation, anyway... I did spot a number of official lightsticks in the stalls, though.) I always felt that The Red Shoes was one of IU's more easily-overlooked lead singles, so I was really glad that it was given some spotlight here.

IU promised to make this concert an exciting event for us! She prefaced dlwlrma with a request for us, the audience, to listen to her story, or her 10-year journey as presented in a movie-like form through this concert. She didn't do very much of the choreography, but that was perfectly fine by me because she delivered this song (and all the others, really) flawlessly!

Before we proceed, I need to say that IU did her talking segments all in *English* for at least the first half of the concert, after which she began to mix in Korean (partly so we could prolong the duration of the concert, ha). I really have no other adjective besides 'cute' to describe the way she speaks! You get the sense that she's still learning - of course, there was the occasional grammatical error - but she was completely understandable throughout!! Alas, I couldn't really place where I'd heard her accent before :P People would cheer to encourage her and whenever she drank water (lol). Back to the songs...

IU remarked that the song she was going to perform - Good Day - was really famous; perhaps it would be one of Singaenas' favourite songs? The people in my section didn't seem too keen on waving their finger lights throughout the concert, but they did for the more well-known songs like this. IU actually did the acclaimed three high notes!! I never thought I'd get to hear that live, but well, it was an *experience*.

IU had us sing along for Friday and The Meaning of You: ""I want to hear Singaenas' voice!"" After these songs, she said she had goosebumps from how well we sang in Korean and acknowledged the difficulty of singing songs in a foreign language, following which she performed Love, a Chinese-language song. According to her, it had been a while since she'd last sung that live, but she thought it'd be a nice gift to us Singaena. (For context, ethnic Chinese form a giant percentage of Singapore's population; Mandarin, then, is a pretty dominant second language.) At some point there was some loud feedback from the microphone and IU jumped from the shock (LOL), and then she switched to her turquoise microphone.

IU then said that the next song was not originally in her planned set-list, but she had been thinking about singing it for some time. She dedicated it to ""the person whom [she misses]."" Orange lights shone down upon her, and she launched into... Gloomy Clock, with Jonghyun's vocals. This was the one time when I actually shed tears at the concert. Looking back, I'm not sure what exactly I was feeling then - it was probably sadness, mixed in with surprise? - but I suppose I managed to swallow it quickly enough enjoy the rest of one of my favourite songs.

IU remarked that she had grown up from the time when she had released these sad songs (The Story Only I Didn't Know, and Mia). The performances for these were complete with visuals of dark skies and lightning in the background, along with powerful vocals, of course. I think it's awesome how IU has performed these songs from about a decade ago on this special anniversary tour!

The VCR before Twenty-Three was *wild*; it pretty much featured IU Team (from manager Hanteo-oppa to the band and dancers, and the like) badmouthing their diva, in jest. ""IU is too slow, I wish she could come out of her house faster... The concerts go on for too long, the scores are this thick... Last time, she wanted to perform this song which wasn't planned (Love of B) suddenly. It was difficult to play on guitar and we tried our best, but screwed up :( We've waited over ten hours to film this VCR... IU made fun of my acting during the last tour!!""

IU wore round glasses throughout Glasses and Zeze! Later on, she said that she wrote BBIBBI with her relationship with Uaenas in mind - ""I hope we'll never have to give each other yellow cards?"" - following which she did the Super Stunning Choreography with her dancers, in its entirety!! Afterwards, she said she used to focus on negativity earlier in her career, but has since grown into a person who can now focus on the love from the people around her and fans, and who likes herself as she is. She also remarked that she was really surprised by all the love While she did not perform the choreography for Palette, she did pull off the rap perfectly! This was accompanied by a VCR highlighting moments from different album campaigns (and the occasional acting project, such as My Mister, which I believe you should watch should you have the time) throughout the last ten years. 

IU brought out her marshmallow friends!! Some of them even went to engage fans sitting along the aisles in the stalls. They weren't wearing plump body suits, but they were already cute enough :P After Boo, IU noted that this would be the last tour when she'd perform songs such as Marshmallow and Boo, as she thought it was time for her to leave these songs with a ""cute image"" behind. ""Aww, don't be sad, everyone!!"" Some of the marshmallows were acting sad, and IU essentially told them to get a hold of themselves, LOL. They bade us goodbye soon after :(

The dancers reappeared in Christmas costumes for the final few songs before the encore. I think I'll be able to have a Merry Christmas this holiday indeed. Also, Last Night Story is really so much fun! And one huge highlight was definitely having IU hear us shout ""IU cham-chotda!"" (""I really like IU!"") during You and I, the final song for the main concert.

The VCR for the first encore featured a younger IU, played by child actress Kim Gyu-ri (who is so cute!), browsing quite a number of cassette tapes (including one titled ""dlwlrma"" featuring this IU concert, lol) in a shop called ""Violet Video"". IU came out in a fancy white dress and performed Through the Night to a sea of firefly-like green finger lights. ""Ah, those lights really looked like fireflies... Is this the event that you'd prepared for me?""

The [actual fan event](https://www.facebook.com/sgheartiu/photos/a.365045247004229/1156821994493213/?type=3&amp;permPage=1) was actually for Dear Name, LOL! We continued waving our finger lights, but unlike before, we raised the banners that Singapore Heart IU had prepared for us. (At this point, I'd like to thank Singapore Heart IU for preparing all these, especially the finger lights; it felt nice to wave along to IU's songs even without a lightstick.) The VCR at the back showed the trees featured on the artwork of IU's debut album coming into full (violet) bloom. Right after this, IU waved goodbye and left for the backstage with her band. The ending credits, featuring snippets from various episodes of IU TV, then started rolling. Some people started leaving the theatre at this point, eek.

Honestly I wasn't sure if IU would do her famous second encore (or re-encore, or en-encore) for this particular tour stop, but wow, she never disappoints :'D She came out in casual wear - that graphic tee looked really familiar, did she wear it recently? - and told us that she would not be able to stay for very long, as all of IU Team had to catch their flight to Bangkok for their concert there tomorrow (wow)... She then asked us, ""What would you all like to hear? I don't really know what songs Singaena like in particular..."" She also told the security that we were all free to record and/or photograph her for this particular segment, as it was technically not part of the show, ha.

She eventually performed The Shower, with part of the reason being that someone in the front rows of the stalls had been yelling for it. She also did consider Rain Drop, but ultimately went with Heart (an equally superb choice, considering how it has had a place pretty much every one of IU's encores since 2015, when it was first released). She and her band then bade us a final goodbye, close to 9pm ;___;

At certain points throughout the concert's second half, she expressed her surprised at all the love she was receiving from Singaena - ""I never knew that I could do a concert here... I'm sorry I couldn't come here earlier!"" and also praised the on-site translator (whom she'd not done a prior rehearsal with, heh) for doing a great job. The translator thanked her too :P

*****

**Conclusion**

How would I describe IU's performance? Look up ""perfect"" and all its synonyms; there you have it! I truly don't know what else I can say, possibly other than she surpasses herself on her various studio recordings because she hits every note just right, all live. Her crystal-clear voice also transcends the enemy that is a less-than-stellar sound system; from my seat, I did find the sound at the Star Theatre lacking at times...

I really, really hope IU makes good on her promise to come back again in future! (She also said that she'd bring her family here for a holiday, hehe!) I'd be so excited to watch her surpass herself on her next tour, and offer my love as a fan alongside my fellow Singaena.

Thank you for reading this if youve gotten this far! I may edit this for coherency, work on formatting and field questions as best as possible. I could also try and add photos later, though I doubt they add very much in the grand scheme of things. (The only time I'd taken out my phone was during the second encore, and even then my ""fancam"" is of relatively poor quality...) Fellow concertgoers, please feel free to correct me where I've gotten something wrong/unclear and write about any notable moment during the concert that I might have missed. Many thanks again!",8,1,False,self,,,,,

I tried downloading shows on Netflix to my iPad, watching the in flight movies, playing my Switch, etc. while these could entertain me, nothing took away my anxiety; Until, YouTube Music. On YT Music you can download music videos for offline viewing later. The amount of calmness and okay I feel when flying and watching Kpop is honestly something Ive NEVER experienced before. I dont freak out in intense turbulence anymore and it has really made me okay with traveling. I just wanted to share that with you guys and maybe help someone if they have some anxiety as well.

And I know that birth rates play a major role in a countrys economic health. And that they occur in intervals (baby boom vs bust every few decades). More births means more people in the workforce in the future. Less births means less people in the workforce. The babies of today are the entrepreneurs, scientists, and doctors of the far future.

 SO, my question is:
Because South Korea has the lowest birth rates and highest amount of abortions in the world, how will this effect the KPop industry in the future? Will there be less idols? Will the KPop industry cool down? Will it be less profitable? How will the future of KPop look?

In addition,  YG ent has allowed its artists to do solo activities on the side, or have recruited a few of them. Such as GD, Taeyang, Seungri, CL, and Lee Hi. (and now Mino, Bobby, and Jennie)

JYP also has a decent run with soloists. Some of the 2PM members, Baek Ahyeon, and Suzy. (and now Fei and Jackson)

Later on, Taemin, Jonghyun, Taeyeon, have also tapped into the solo market and made some massive achievements. Since then, SM has been far more open with giving their idols solos. Especially the SNSD and SHINee members. Sometimes they give out SMStation solos. 

And ever since Produce 101, quite a lot of trainees have debuted as soloists (either initially, eventually, or on the side): Chungha, Jieqiong (in China), Sejeong, Insun, Soyeon (before G-idle), Juna, Sira, Samuel, Sewoon, Donghan, Moonbok, Yongguk, and Seonho.

Loona has been introduced to the public by each member eventually revealed with their own solo EP. 

And now, some of the hottest KPop hits are by soloists. Move, Gashina, Solo, Dally, Lip&amp;Hip, Touch. 

So, will we continue seeing a rise in soloists? I think so because KPop fans are so used to loving groups and might want something new. And because fan loyalty is at an all-time high, theyre willing to support their faves whether they go solo or not.",29,1,False,self,,,,,

most of my argument goes for bts. i know that bts isnt the whole kpop community/fanbase, but im specifically keeping bts in mind. 

im a korean boy who generally loves all types of music. my mother grew up in korea and she agrees with me that its great that korea, a small place is getting hugely recognized. however, theres a problem. there are people out there who are oversexualizing these people, shipping them together and making very disgusting indepth fan fictions about them. i personally dont have anything against korean music, i do not listen to it though because of fanbase giving them a bad rep. the fact that we also have a huge beauty standard for the women in kpop is also disgusting, but i guess thats been normalized over the years. 

anyways, if you want to add onto my argument or rebuttal against me, feel free to do so. im using my freedom of speech. . thank you. 

TLDR; kpop fans are bad because they oversexualize my culture. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I have three questions, the first is referrenced in the title. 

So I've been into kpop for only a couple of years and am mostly into third generation groups. I would like to know how kpop has changed with reguards to : 
- idol appearances on variety shows.
- age of the maknaes of groups
- number of comebacks a year
- management (if this info is available) have there been changes in the way idols are managed eg. How their managers work with them. 
I think some changes are obvious eg the huge amount of debuts and the hypersaturation of the industry. What other changes have long-term/more knowledgeable fans noticed? 

2 - What are your top 3 favorite concept changes fro groups (could be different groups and groups you don't stan). 

And lastly do you think its possible to have a ""type"" when it comes to biases? I realized my two main biases are both awesome dancers and have very cute laughs but I biased them both due to somewhat underdog(?) bits of their life. ",39,1,False,self,,,,,

[2](https://twitter.com/JAYBUMAOM/status/1074313419149303808):

&gt; most of the fans probably not gonna like the rap project... lol its like suuuuper duper hip hop but I had to do it!! lyrical content wise prolly my one of my more personal projects. out of 16 songs theres not one love song lol.  this is why I'm unpopular 

[3](https://twitter.com/JAYBUMAOM/status/1074313774453026817):

&gt; also I know most of you are KPOP fans but if u listened to my music or followed my career I'm pretty distant from the KPOP world right now.  and its not like I dislike it or tried to distance myself but it just sort of happened naturally cause I'm in a different lane.

[4](https://twitter.com/JAYBUMAOM/status/1074314386741719040):

&gt; SOO therefore u prolly won't see a collab with me and the idols u guys speak of.  But hey never say never right? I know a lot of these guy's look up to me whether they like to admit it or not but I am honored and appreciative of the acknowledgement

[5](https://twitter.com/JAYBUMAOM/status/1074315634454913024):

&gt; Also a lot the industry probably doesn't like my existence cause I went against the grain and succeeded doing things my own way. by doing that It give's other artist's courage and show's them there is a way to do this the unconventional way which is a big headache for the system

Everyone knows that fangirls make up the bulk of male group fans and fanboys make up a large share of girl group fans. But do you think they like them for the same reasons? Do you think one focuses on visuals more than the other? Or do they both kind of have similar motives for lack of a better word. My initial guess, and correct me if this seems totally wrong, is that fangirls do take visuals into account but they have a deeper admiration for the idols beyond their looks. That would definitely explain why boy groups have more longevity than girl groups.

On the other hand, and this is my opinion, but it seems like fanboys take visuals as the most important reason. Hence the way that girl groups are dressed up. I know boy groups are also sexualized, but like its appalling what some of the things they make these female idols wear.

I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan or anything, but I genuinely like this new style of music.

However, since this is uncharted territory, I have some issues that I've come across. A big one is about choosing a bias and whether I should even have one. I'm a straight (18M) guy, and I find BLACKPINK's Jennie and TWICE's Tzuyu and Nayeon to be my biases (it's so hard to choose Tzuyu or Nayeon, I wanna say Tzuyu but ahhh!). The problem is that I feel like I shouldn't have a bias because it leaves out the rest of the group. Because I like the groups as a whole. Also I feel that it's kinda weird to focus on a celebrity (granted, I've never really had a major celebrity crush before, and I see that having a bias is a big part of the kpop culture).

Another problem that I've had (and may reflect all of my interests in general) is how I've gotten interested in interviews and ""funny moments"" videos of BTS and TWICE. It may sound harmless, but I'm not sure if I should continue to watch stuff like that on YouTube or go the extra mile and start watching variety shows. I feel like this with a lot of my interests that involve celebrities. I guess it reminds me of those people who love reality TV shows like *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*. I feel like it'll mean that I'm becoming obsessed, and I don't think that's good. 

I don't want to stop loving kpop, but these are some things that I think about and that I'd like to talk about with you guys. Also please forgive me for this WALL of text.",10,1,False,self,,,,,

Example 2: the other side of example is that I thought that fandoms support each other since Kpop is so niche, that people try to make Kpop more normal since it isn't really ""accepted"" in the west, but the hate some individuals and groups spread is just unreal (some Army -&gt; Momoland for example).

Example 3: more of a controversial one, so please don't hate me. Before I listened to Twice, I always read that twice can't sing and I believed it, I even was dumb enough to listen to MR removed videos. Later, when I got into them I realized that some of the members have beautiful voices and everyone can sing to some degree.

For instance, I remember being pleasantly surprised by Twice's Chaeyoung's rapping skills during Sixteen but none of the group's title tracks really allowed her to showcase them. So I do think that if the group had gone for a music style which would have allowed for a strong rap, Chaeyoung would've been more popular, considering that there's definitely still room for good female idol rappers in the industry.

And while I don't really follow Winner nowadays, I feel like if Winner had gone to more variety shows, Seunghoon could've shined more due to his variety skills.

The song seems to exist in an in-between place that isn't seen in most songs. It's a song that happens once in a lifetime. It's just very genuine, all the elements are vital and full of emotion, and the different emotions that come from the different parts mix together into this cocktail of really interesting depth. For example, the way the songs transforms when Kid Milli comes in without losing focus is genius. The lyrics are great and serve the song, and the song serves the lyrics. And that memorable hook is so powerful and unique, not to mention the depth and nuances Palo has in his voice. This song is so unique and feels more specific to Korean scene than anything out of America, it's literally a song that could only exist in k-pop.

Anyone watching it? Want to discuss the past few episodes? I just binged the last 4 eps. 

**Thoughts:**

* I'm honestly shocked by the variety of celebrities that came on the show! So cool! Lol Didn't think BTS Jimin would show up since BTS has been quite busy this year plus there were quite a few actresses too which was cool because they don't normally associate themselves with the music side of the industry! 
* I like the show format. You can request people you don't know too. It's like talking about your favorite songs except you bring the artist out to compete. 
* Park So Hyun was hilarious. It feels like she represented the Kpop fandom. LOL She comes home and watched idol videos/fancams and catches up on variety shows haha. 
* (Don't hate me) I wasn't a big fan of Hwang Yeji's performance (Junho's recommendation + JYP trainee) but maybe she'll do better. 

**My favorite singers/perfomances:**

1. [BIBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd0vTW7bJls) \- Really love the way she sang! I'm glad Yoon Mirae and Tiger JK brought her out! I also really like her rendition of [Peek A Boo by Red Velvet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wNI4ZNqN2c)!
2. [Twelve has such an awesome voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rrlOezNE0k). Reminds me a little of G.Soul
3. Loved [Yura's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KRbeQKPU_o)!! I just discovered that it has a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgWWNNwc7RE)! &lt;- Totally recommend listening. It's super catchy!",18,1,False,self,,,,,

I still dunno but then again maybe not. My bias is Hoshi.

But then it occured to me that maybe I was paying more attention to Wonwoo because he's the member I relate with the most. 

Like based on his personality, I'd probably talk to him if we went to the same school. And we'd probably talk about stuff some other people find weird but we've both come across (he reads a lor and though I don't read so much anymore, I did a lot back in the day).

The funny thing is there's this boy tha reminds me of Hoshi sometimes just his explosive loudness and energy. But we dont talk much. Maybe we would if we constantly have to see each other in a group/class but not voluntarily we wouldn't.  I mean he's a pleasant person but not the type of person I'd normally gel with. But someone like wonwoo on the other hand, though it might take a while to approach him, I'd probably do so and enjoy talking to him.

So I guess I'd never talk to Hoshi in real life if we knew each other then? (Lowkey crying hamster tears here but then again, isn't that similar to my situation now? Lol)

For example I'll use Jackson from GOT7 and Lay from EXO. 

Jackson has been able to be a part of promotions for all Korean albums up to this point. I know he did a lot of variety and promotions at some point in Japan and didn't participate in their Japanese promotions. I'm not sure if thay was due to conflicts with his scheduling in China or if it was some other political issue. 

Lay hasn't been part of promotions in Korea in awhile. I know he's recently been doing his own thing and even has a studio in China. It's been stated a few times that he is still part of Exo but why isn't he able to promote with them? 

I've seen a few other Chinese idols run into the same thing and I'm honestly just so confused because some idols aren't affected and some are. If anyone can explain I'd be so greatful. 

I hope this is okay to post, I read the rules and it seems like this would be okay but if it's not I can take it down.

I think shes being abused by YG (the man). 

Fans or haters can chalk her behavior up to fame getting into her head or something...but I genuinely worry shes just getting used by that old creep. The favoritism...be it clothes, solo and perks over other members might not just mean he likes her more, but that hes trying to compensate for something.

Just my 2 cents. I hope shes okay, because this is extremely heavy. Maybe she has lost all joy in life because of abuse. At this point...her attitude is depressing and I think theres something horribly, horribly wrong.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

These are all my opinion and I welcome yours as well. I mainly only listen to GG so i'm biased there. Also I love many more songs that came out this year, but these came into my mind first.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Hwasa - Be calm**: Beautiful, personal, intimate and Hwasa has a beautiful voice. This was perfect and one of my few 10s this year.
2. **Taeyeon - Circus**: Beautiful singing in this one. The background singing part may take a bit to get used to, but it's a special track. Also a very interesting meaning. It was popular enough that an official English lyric video was released. I can't wait for more of her music.
3. **Red Velvet - Bad Boy**: One of those songs that I couldn't stop listening to. Had a very good beat, choreography, and the singing was excellent. Everything just flowed well vocally, as well the underlying beat.
4. **BLACKPINK - (DDU-DU DDU-DU)**: One of the catchiest songs of the year. I love this group and this song was pretty strong in all its drops and mixing and all. Excellent rapping, singing and choreography. Forever Young comes pretty close but that was more top 20-30 material for me.
5. **Sunmi - Siren**: Such a strong song. Sunmi is such an amazing singer too. I loved the old school sound of the backing track. It reminded me of when I started listening to kpop around late 2008 or so. Also has quite a good meaning in the song.
6. **Apink - I'm So Sick**: This song was such a departure from their usual cute style. I found it to be excellent though. I'm really hoping their January comeback is more this style. I listened to it nonstop for quite a while. Plus whoever did the backing track with the singing on it was genius.
7. **Mamamoo - Wind Flower**: Grew on me very quickly with a catchy beat, excellent vocals, and a strong message. Also some of the funnest choreography I saw this year.
8. **(G)i-dle - Hann**: After a very successful debut song the group floored me with this one. It really showed an excellent shift in their sound after what some may say was a safe debut song. So much good singing here and there is an excellent flow to the rhythm and sound. A group to look forward to in the future.
9. **fromis\_9 - Love Bomb**: This is actually one of the catchiest songs of the year. A cute message and honestly some relatively complicated singing. This one was stuck in my head so much after it came out I knew it was special. Another group i'm expecting bigger things from.
10. **Oh My Girl - Secret Garden**: A very pretty song. I love the meaning of it and I can just listen to it because it flows so well. Also the ladies this year had very improved vocals.

Just Missed: Twice - What is Love, EXID - I Love You, Twice - Yes or Yes, So many Mamamoo songs....

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus: A non kpop song that is a 10 from me is **Mitski - Nobody**. It resonated with me to an extreme degree and her whole CD is easily album of year material. ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

My original idea was to pick a song for each letter of the alphabet, but I quickly realized that some letters had half a dozen candidates and several had...none.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead, pick the three letters that have the most candidates for you and explain which one wins for you and why.

&amp;#x200B;

So is your B-track Red Velvet's Bad Boy or CLC's Black Dress? Maybe it's Red Velvet's Butterflies or Blue Lemonade? Maybe it's NCT U's Baby Don't Stop? 

&amp;#x200B;

For C, will you choose fromis\_9's Coloring or IZONE's Colors? 

&amp;#x200B;

DKDK or D4? Love Bomb or La Vie En Rose? Love4eva or La Ta Ta? Hi High or Hann?

&amp;#x200B;

Make your choices!

&amp;#x200B;

My letters are: B, H, and S.

&amp;#x200B;

B: So hard. Black Dress, Bad Boy, Butterflies, Blue Lemonade...

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can listen to Black Dress no matter what mood I'm in, so I think it has the most consistent appeal for me.

&amp;#x200B;

H: Torn between RV's Hit That Drum (that fucking high note), Loona's Heat (sensual), Loona's Hi High (never got old), and Hann (that rap).

&amp;#x200B;

Final choice is Hi High because I enjoyed the live stages so much.

&amp;#x200B;

S: RV's So Good (great but not as catchy as some choices) and maybe also Sassy Me, Sunmi's Siren, Loona's Stylish (vocals), and NCT 127's Simon Says (I don't even know, I die every time they say 'Bless me, achoo').

Long story short, I was talking with some friends and realized that this upcoming year is quite frankly going to kill me, because both my ultimate biases are almost certainly going to enlist, as well as some others I'm incredibly fond of (Leo, Xiumin, Jinho, Suho if the rumors are true). 

Obviously, it's duty and while I think forced conscription systems are cruel (for personal reasons), I understand the necessity right now in South Korea. I also understand that \*knocks wood\* the actual chance of engagement remains fairly low. But in less serious, purely practical industry terms, I'm a little concerned. Every boy group I seem to give a damn about, with the exception of Big Bang, has basically disbanded as soon as someone has gone to the military. Suju and Shinhwa are exceptions - but especially for a group like VIXX, on a smaller label, with a new boy group coming out to ""fill their shoes,"" I'm very scared. 

I don't want to sound like I'm more scared of disbandment than like, worried for their safety - but at the same time, from what I know of Korean politics, the chance of engagement is still relatively low, as I said, and the chance of disbandment seems very real. Is it a crapshoot for companies? Do they just figure well, they won't be making us money while they're in the army? HISTORY disbanded as soon as their eldest enlisted. SS501 swears they aren't disbanded, but between Kim Hyunjoong's general trashfire status and the absolutely idiotic idea of sending one member as one gets discharged, they're not getting back together. Hell, with NCT getting the bulk of SM's attention and promotion, I'm mildly concerned that even EXO isn't safe. And Pentagon is on CUBE, which we all know is worthless trash that doesn't give a good goddamn about anything but squeezing their artists for everything they have. Jellyfish seems to actually care about their artists' welfare, but still. 

I'm glad that I don't generally have to worry about anything actually happening to the majority of Korean soldiers, but at the same time, losing basically all three of my bias groups in a year would absolutely kill me. So any clarification or reassurance would be really, really welcome. And again, mods, apologies if this is in the wrong place; I'll move it elsewhere if there is a better spot - but I had to ask.

When I first got into Kpop, I learned group member names by choosing one member whose visuals I liked the most, and then trying to always recognize them. Eventually I learned all the others, too. Funnily enough, most of the initial standout members don't end up as my bias.

These days, it's definitely a lot easier to differentiate between faces, but the problem is that so many groups have 8+ members, and a lot of them get similar makeup and styling. So what I've found helpful is to watch a reality or variety show for the group, and then come up with some label that helps me remember who's who. 

For example: Recently, I got into The Boyz. I watched their Flower Snack show, and I would associate each member with another idol who looked similar to them or had the same vibe. Q looks like Doyoung, Younghoon looks like Kim Donghan, Sunwoo has the same eyes as Lucas, Eric had Yugyeom vibes, New has the same face shape as Luhan, and Jacob reminded me of SF9's Jaeyoon. Then I picked out certain facial features that stood out on the rest of the members--Sangyeon and Juyeon's noses, Hyunjae's voice, Haknyeon's shorter height. The only problem was that I still got Kevin and Hwall mixed up, but then I realized that Hwall's eyebrows make him look like an angrier version of Kevin lol. Also, is it just me or does Hwall lowkey look like Park Seojoon?

So what other tricks do you use to learn member names?",51,1,False,self,,,,,

As a fan of SHINee:

I guess this year, they had their Japanese concert tour early in the year. Then they released their 3 part album with 3 (title?) songs. Taemin's been off in Japan doing a long concert tour and released a Japanese album with a music video. Key recently debuted as a solo artist with his album Face w/ 2 music videos (one with Soyou and another with Crush) and Onew following his footsteps also released a solo album called Voice with title track called Blue. Minho focused on acting this year and was in a movie earlier in the year. Of course, Onew just enlisted in the military so he'll be MIA for a little bit but I'd say SHINee has been very active this year. (Feel free to add anything I'm missing\~)",125,1,False,self,,,,,

&gt; Title: To Tinkerbell..! 

&gt; Hello It is KNK's leader Jihun. The weather has become really cold right?? I have something important to tell Tinkerbells that have waited for a long time so I am writing this letter! Due to the long hiatus time both us and Tinkerbell have become tired but you have waited for us KNK and loved us so we are sincerely grateful, the reason we were able to get through was all because of Tinkerbells 

&gt; This year many things happened but the biggest would probably be Youjin Hyung not being able to be together with us. Of course the decision for Youjin Hyung leaving was one that required lots of discussion between Youjin Hyung, the company and the members and everyone thought that this would be the best decision. We still contact Youjin Hyung and we wish the best for him, Youjin Hyung is also supporting KNK too! I am still upset but please do not think negatively or sadly 

&gt; We thoroughly thought about how we could present a better image to Tinkerbells through this long hiatus time.. As we monitored out performances we felt that the space of being 5 members to becoming 4 members was bigger than we thought.. So we thought that we needed someone to fill in that place, as a result we have decided to have a new member. 

&gt; Through this long time we really wanted to show you a cool image and we really discussed for a long time.

&gt; Instead of getting to know through other media we thought it would be a good idea for us to tell you first so I am very carefully representing out team as the leader to write this letter..! 

&gt; To be honest we are worried but also excited as to Tinkerbell's reaction.. We would like it it you could trust and support our decision 

&gt; Our new member is someone that we have been close with even before our debut so everyone is close with them and we are getting along like family! 

&gt; In the future we would like it if you could love and support our new member as much as you love us!! 

&gt; Finally we, KNK are planning to work hard and will show you a good image as much as (we have made you wait) through the long hiatus 

&gt; We really thank Tinkerbells who have waited for such a long time and we (carefully) ask for support for KNK and our new member!!

&gt; Soon! We will come back with a good album and an improved image 

&gt; Thank you..!",17,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

A facet of KPOP that's unique to the genre is the concept of fixed ""positions"" in groups, such as the main vocalist, dancer, visual, etc. But often, there's members that also deserve acknowledgement for their skills that they don't necessarily get from those standings!

&amp;#x200B;

For example: Hyelin and Seulgi could easily be the main vocals of any other group (see: Hyelin covering Solji's high notes when she was sick and Seulgi's ""I Have Nothing"" cover)...However, they just happen to have the insane powerhouse vocalists Solji and Wendy in their groups who are pretty much impossible to top in that field. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is Joy, who is a top-class visual in her own right who just happens to get outranked in Red Velvet  because they have Irene, who is pretty much THE ideally beautiful Korean woman.

Not necessarily ""iconic"", but things that have definitely left an impression. 

Like bits of advice? Or an experience they had which you learnt from/ was eye opening to you. 
It doesn't have to be only heavy stuff, lighthearted stuff is nice too. 

A couple stand out to me: 

One time during a seventeen fansign I think (I read it online), where The8 asked a fan if she had a boyfriend. She said no and he asked why. She said that oppa (The8) was there and she didn't need one. He then told her not to live like that (not sure this isn't verbatim but he said something along those lines). She then asked if she should go get a boyfriend. He replied that the only role they (seventeen) could fill in her life was that of a guide/supporter (not very sure what word was used - if anyone has a link to the fan trans pls share) and that they can only cheer her on and support her in life. He basically encouraged her to *really* live life. I was really glad this advice was given. 

Another one was one time, Vernon said he was on his way home from work and met a fan at the bus stop. He had seen the same fan earlier at a seventeen-related event and he said that seeing the fan in that moment really made it stand out to him that before they're fan and artist they're both people. (Before this, I sort of used to look at him as an airhead and this made me start seeing him very differently). 

Hoshi - when he spoke about how his dad was in debt before he debuted, but after he debuted it gave his dad encouragement and he was able to get himself together and pay off. Hoshi also sent his family on a vacation. I honestly think this was the beginning of Hoshi being my bias. 

Also, when he mentioned that Seungkwan had been through a lot even though they didn't talk about it (Seungkwan was wiping his tears at the time) I think about this from time to time. 

(Same hoshi opening his mouth to say he would ""just keep working harder"" - or was it ""just keep going"" - when asked how many children he would like to have just had me smh lol)

Hearing BTS Suga talk about his shoulder injury so matter of factly. Idek how I felt. That accident was pretty dangerous. 

On the same vein, when he said he spoke about how fighting was natural (?Sorry Army I cant remember the exact thing he said  ) and even though his mom gave birth to him they've fought a lot - that made me chuckle, and its very true.

And to be honest I have no use for them. They're just sitting there uselessly in my book shelf and tight now I need the money so I thought why not sell them? 

For the Arrival Album:

I saw that on Amazon the ""Ever"" version was being sold for $39.90 (without poster) apparently the Never version is sold out or no one is selling it? Either way I was thinking of selling each album (with their poster) between $30-$35 because I did open them.  

For the Turbulence Album:
 Found it at Amazon for about $35 and on Barnes and noble for about $25 (not sure). I also own this along with its poster (rolled not folded). It has been opened, stickers have been used. Because of the fact it's been opened and the stickers have been used, I am willing to sell from between $13-$20.

I will try to ship from cheapest package delivery so I would also appreciate delivery fee (I will do a bit of research for fees and discuss that with you) 

If interested please DM me. I do have photos of everything if you would like proof that it's all in good condition.

I know that we've gotten glimpses through the years about how shitty kpop is and how, outside of a select few companies, idols are mostly just pretty faces used to bring in profits for their labels. A lot of this stuff terrifies me simply because of how nonchalantly it's discussed. Twice have been on vlives saying that they're grateful JYP made them starve themselves so that they could debut and connect with the fans, and a clip I saw of T-ara showed hosts laughing while taking about how a company forced Hyomin to starve herself. 

I dont get how this shit is allowed in a society. How are the Korean people ok knowing this shit is happening? Also, why don't idols talk about this more through their music or variety show appearances. I know some have made songs talking about their depression and stuff, but I've not seen anything directly criticizing the industry that's done these terrible things to them. Its good to bring up mental health, but at the end of the day, nothing's gonna change if the root problems aren't addressed. Furthermore, the whole fan culture has been bothering me for a long time. I see a lot of praise given about how hard-working Idols are, but at the end of the day, wasn't it Jonghyun who said in his suicide note that ""it was for you, I wanted it to be for me."" The whole culture of idols throwing everything into this industry and having nothing to fall back on I feel is a big part of the depression cycle we hear about, and they do so to please fans, most of whom would ditch them immediately after a dating rumors arise. 

Finally, the whole cute thing hasn't gotten any less cringey to watch the longer I've been in kpop. Neither has the forced sexy thing. Being forced to act a certain way probably only adds to the whole identity crisis idols talk about after their careers. I've always wondered how, in their 30s or 40s, Twice members are gonna feel looking back at how they acted when they were in their mid 20s. At the end of the day, I guess I'm just wondering that if so many idols talk about how unhappy they are with their lives or their careers (Blackpink talking about their lack of comebacks), why they just dont take control of their own lives. Bring the industry's problems to the spotlight through music or public appearances, transfer to another agency that will let you have creative control so that your next album and concept isnt just the whims of some 30 year old guys. There's just seems to be a lot problems and very few attempts by people inside and outside the industry to try and solve them.  ",92,1,False,self,,,,,

All the talk about how it's fate, destiny, how nothing is a coincidence seems like a guy who desperately wants to convince that they're meant to be together.

They used to basically only have BIGBANG and 2NE1 (the milking cows of the company) and even then the company's still lacking (can you believe 2NE1 only had two full albums and BIGBANG three full albums?). These days YG (YHS) always get flack of any issue sorrounding their idols but as far as I know, he's no longer the CEO and it's now his brother holding the title. So what is his current position anyways? And how much power does he have?

The music video was directed by the Japanese director Kyotaro Hayashi who already made his name known in the industry through his different collaborations with different artists Aimyon, Kenshi Yonezu, Mr.Children and so on.

In addition, those who will watch the MV, they will be able to meet the dance duo MIKUNANA who were featuring in the Japan version MV of Clean Bandits Solo song! They also made the choreography of SoRis comeback song, Im Ready.

In order to make her comeback SoRi also received support from her fans through the crowd funding platform Kickstarter! SoRis fans contributed to the project from countries such as USA, Japan, UK, Australia and other 10 countries.

The song is Popstars by K/DA. All the lines highlighted in grey are what I have translated and need review. I mostly used google + the limited knowledge that I have of the language. I am not necessarily looking for perfect grammar (because it is a song after all) but I want to make sure I am not saying something COMPLETELY silly.  70% has to be in Japanese for the competition; so I had to translate a little more than just the Korean parts only.

I have left the permissions open for anyone to comment so I am hoping that means anyone can suggest edits. You can suggest edits to the romaji and/or the actual Japanese, whatever you feel more comfortable with. The English at the end of each line is of course what I am trying to say.

I will appreciate ANY help I can get. Thank you sooo much!

Twice is my favorite group of all-time and I love the group to death. I am a proud ONCE and do not have intentions of demeaning any of the girls nor any of the JYP staff and whomever they may have hired in the process of making this song. It is simply a review and evaluation of the song in of itself.  
 

To start, I will say that personally, I dont like ballads at all. I see the appeal of them but my personal taste is more upbeat and something I can jam to. Opinions and biases aside, I will be reviewing/critiquing/evaluating/whateveryouwanttocallit-ing The Best Thing I Ever Did.  
 

The Best Thing I Ever Did is a very sweet and heartfelt ballad that suits Twices youthful and cute concept and also meshing nicely with the holidays. The song isnt emotionally driven and isnt a very powerful ballad. Rather it goes for a more laid back, relaxed feel that most ballads go for in their more mature, powerful and vocal focus. Twice doesnt suit the traditional ballad style which is what makes this song stand out. The more mature style of a traditional ballad would make it feel pretty awkward as a Twice song. I honestly cant think of a song of Twices that fits a more traditional ballad style. Be as ONE, Someone Like Me,  Turtle,   Jaljayo Good Night,  Ice Cream, One in a Million, Say Yes, and Like a Fool are their more ballad-like songs. They all have a very poppy element to them. And while that is a solid number of tracks, the only one that I can see really fitting a ballad style is Be as ONE with its very heavy ballad style. The opening piano, soft harmonic vocals, drawn out chorus, the whole shebang makes it feel very much like a traditional ballad, it lacks the bit hit in each chorus and only has one about 70% of the way through the song. And the buildup and end to it are quite poor in my opinion. Think Ailee How Could You Do This to Me for an example. She always hits with super strong vocals and the chorus is clearly the big part of the song and she shows the hurt that is explained in the song. Now I dont know the meaning of Be as ONE but it doesnt have that hitting element of a traditional ballad. I know I got off topic so I digress.  
 

Back to the original topic, Best Thing as Im going to dub it for now, doesnt fit that style at all and is more of a pop ballad. Pop ballads tend to have lighter instrumentals and have a deeper underlying meaning to the song, at least from what Ive heard. Best Thing has a very unique, minimalist instrumental with the piano, bells, literal sleigh bells, a soft drum set, and theres even shaker and tambourine if Im hearing it correctly. The song seems to start in F Major with a progression of I-iii-vi-IV (F-Am-Dm-Bb) with a V (C) chord sprinkled in at the beginning. The Bb chords 3rd is lowered from an E to and Eb making the chord Bb minor which isnt conventional, but isnt exactly unheard of either. Its a very subtle change and maybe Im not hearing it correctly. I dont have my keyboard nearby as Im out-of-town visiting family. Although they have a piano, its been at LEAST 20 years since its been tuned, and its kept in the hottest (or coldest depending on the time of day) part of the house. The Bridge changes to C minor with the same I-iii-vi-IV (C-Eb-Bb-F) progression which allows it to flow nicely back to the original key. Overall, I really like the instrumental and how well it flows. JYP never ceases to produce great songs and have a solid musical foundation to them.   
 

As for the vocals, theyre also very soft and well played out. Sana and Momo were the members that really stood out to me in this track. They seem to be more in their range compared to other songs where they seem to be in the higher register of their voice which causes strain on their vocal chords. Its specifically noticeable in Momos voice as she sounds a bit raspy and nasally more often than not. In this song her voice is super clear and crisp. Sanas vocal range in this song just sounds more natural. It seems as if shes always singing in almost a falsetto range in most of their title tracks and trying too hard to sound cute. The range of the vocals as a whole isnt that wide but it does modulate very nicely and fit the girls well. I wasnt blown away by the vocals but not necessarily impressed either. They seemed to be on par for what I expected. Nothing in the vocals stood out and had that WOW factor.  
 

Overall, the song is good. Great even. Giving my personal two cents, I like it and its one of my favorite pop-ballads. Im not a huge ballad fan, but I LOVE this song as it is. Its lighthearted, fun, and gives you that warm feeling that you might feel when cozy-ing up with a nice book on a cold winter night next to the crackling fireplace. I know thats specific but thats what I envision. What really gets me in this song is the instrumental. It drives the song by not having super drawn out piano or bells. Its always moving and thats what I love. It moves the song around and doesnt lull me to sleep like a lot of ballads.  
 

Ok. Im done. Im sure I would have more thoughts about the song if I had actually taken more time to go over the song and given it more time to develop but I wanted to get this out there while its still relevant. If you have any comments or suggestions, Id love to hear it and discuss further. Ill take any (constructive) criticism that you may have. Again, Im not trying to demean anyone, just doing a bit of a deeper dive into a song. I dont see much content like this and I thought it might be fun to experiment with the idea. Please let me know if youd like to see more content like this. Thanks! !",6,1,False,self,,,,,

- mino is better without winner

- i think jennie is better without bp, as you may all know about the issue about her being lazy and stuff on stage, and based on my observations she looks more energetic/happy when shes doing her solo promotions and she looks more lively when she's going out to do solo promotions

- nct should stop adding more members, yes, they are an experimental group but why do they keep adding members if they cant even treat old members correctly

- got7 is getting real boring, i stanned them since just right upto never ever, its just that their songs are sounding so generic and i just hope they can release like a song that can show off their talents more

- monsta x getting ://///// errr, idk how to explain thisss,, I've been a fan since 2016 ive seen them grow, this is my wish, i wished that monsta x will be big, they did but, they become too showy of their body?? idk its just when im scrolling thru their promotion vids, all i can see is wonho's abs or shownu's body, but i guess i just missed stuck era:(

- ""old kpop stans"" should shut up about their ""old kpop songs are better"" just accept it that skz, g-idle, etc..
are getting big this year

- i think f(x) stans should stop hoping for a comeback, sm sucks we all know that

- blackpink's new album is a dissapointment. their comebacks are getting longer and longer, and it's getting boring honestly 

- red velvet's music are getting stubborn, they look sooo bored and out of place in their promotional vids this era (rbb) i prefer red flavor days, pleasw give my girls a better music sm

- if you dont like the people commenting ""stan loona"" just dont interact with it, easy as that. that's even the reason why i got into loona

(clarification : if you're commenting stan loona on a sensitive or serious tweet please delete it)

- wendy is ignorant and not problematic. but pleaseee she should still apologize and reflect

- exo's rapper line are not good,,

- just because an idol is from the big 3 yall can shit on them that includes skz and nct, they're one of the most hard working people i know in this industry

- svt is falling down because of their fans, im not gonna elaborate even more

- infinite is holding up until hoya left

- jyp should've kept wonder girls but hey 

- kard's cool but if they keep doing tropical house genre its a byebye

So I recently heard about the CLC and IZ*One controversy with the song La Vie en Rose. I have mixed emotions about the whole thing. I feel bad   so for CLC. They deserve to have a time in the light, but I can understand the stance of the song may not have done as well with CLC because of their lack of Domestic fan base. Money wise, CLC doesnt make a lot unfortunately. Plus, with them being so underestimated and so unrepresented who knows if this song would have been as good or as well received. 

Do I believe they should have gotten a chance to sing this song? Absolutely. I cant blame IZ*One because its not like they said lets steal their song. But I think its more than just Cube saying we dont think we could promote the song well. We dont really know what happened between the time CLC teased this song as their comeback and the song being given to IZ*One , 

So thoughts? Im curious to know how you guys feel about this ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

A few months ago I started realizing I was far too attached to TWICE. It seemed like whenever I was alone, my life revolved around them and their lives. Keep in mind Ive never been interested in someone I know personally, let alone 9 girls who Ive never and will never meet. Compound that with the toxicity and childishness of stan culture, I decided to take a break from kpop to see if my feelings stayed the same. It was probably one of the best decisions Ive ever made. Becoming emotionally detached from them and just being a fan made me start treating everything differently. I stopped caring about charts and views altogether and I honestly can say I dont care one bit about what they do in their personal lives (this was the biggest reason I took a step back. I didnt feel comfortable being so invested in someone elses life). ",406,1,False,self,,,,,

I could be totally wrong but it seems like it was a pretty strong year in general for k-pop. For the girl group side you had the big 3 groups (Twice, Red Velvet, Blackpink) all have successful comebacks (or comeback in blackpink's case) and concerts. You had the rise of Momoland from relatively unknown to having one of the most popular songs of the year and G-Idle blowing away everyone's expectations. There was also some debuts from some groups that show a lot of promise (Loona, Fromis 9, Izone) and I feel like there was a lot of successful songs from solo artists (Chungha, Sunmi, IU). Not to mention Mamamoo, Apink, OMG, WJSN, Pristin V all releasing some great tracks (I'm sure I'm forgetting some).

For the boy groups I'll be the first to admit I don't really follow them but it's hard to ignore the level of success BTS has had this year, plus Pentagon - Shine might have been my favorite song of year. Maybe someone who follows boy groups can chime in on this. 

p.s. - I'm still a fairly new fan, so is there a general consensus for best year ( or years) for k-pop? If so I'm interested in knowing your opinion so I can check it out. ",34,1,False,self,,,,,

I also saw somewhat of a similarity ever since i saw their performance on MAMA. (some timestamps that i saw someone tweet out: :08, :30, :38, 1:01, 2:30)
i think pledis has been accused of copying sm concepts with get it and bad boy, but with seventeens usp being that they self-produce everything, im afraid that people will bash the performance unit.... (but hoshi has said that theyve (reluctantly) gotten more dependent on outside choreographers so... maybe that has something to do with it?)

i think its great that seventeen are branching out to do different concepts since theyve always been quite innovative and i dont want people to hate on such talented people, but this cb DID seem to be quite similar to nct.. just my thoughts.
as someone who stans both groups i dont want people to fight over that.... ugh I hate stan twitter

idk... i wanted other peoples opinions on it? 

sorry if this is against the guidelines; first time poster here, please feel free to remove it if it is!!

And this was after he broke up with Taeyeon, but i kept seeing EXO-Ls say she was terrible and fake and I didnt know anything about her or SNSD so I believed it. Then I kept seeing stuff on tumblr about the Jessica Jung Protection Squad or whatever they were called and those people were usually shitting on Taeyeon and sometimes Tiffany. So yeah, my thoughts on Taeyeon and SNSD werent so hot at first. I avoided everything by them like the plague, or if I did watch an SNSD video I wouldnt like Taeyeon because I had all these misconceptions.

And then one day I was watching some fan video and they played I in the background, which made me intrigued. I listened to the song, realized I liked Taeyeons voice a lot, and then I watched all her other MVs and fell in love. Then I realized that the only EXO fans who truly hate her are over-obsessive Baekhyun stans and a few overly bitter Jessica stans (you are never a real fan if you put down other artists), and since then my image of her has been cleared up a lot. Shes by far my favorite soloist and one of my top biases, and I cant believe it took me more than a year to come around.",124,1,False,self,,,,,

I have some ideas but I havent followed Kpop long enough nor am I familiar with enough groups to kind of make a conclusion. But here are my thoughts..

Pros:

Since their seniors sunbaes were really popular the groundwork has already been set in a way, as in there is a huge potential fan base for them to draw in. 

Cons:

There is the possibility they might live in the shadow of said group and not be able to draw that groups fanbase in. 

What do you think? Do you think having a popular group as a sunbae is more of a blessing or a curse? Maybe a little bit of both?",20,1,False,self,,,,,

So first off, I want to thank everyone for their support of my previous [PD48 thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a366ik/where_are_they_now_produce_48_edition_a_status/) and [PD101 (Season 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a5cjj0/where_are_they_now_produce_101_season_1_edition_a/) thread.

So first things, it's we're about to approach the 1.5 year mark since Broduce finished airing, and nearing the of Wanna One as a group. Crazy to think how time flies.

With that said, let's get an update on what's next for our boys coming into 2019, since Wanna One is ending their tenure in the K-pop industry and PD101 Season 4 is slated to begin in 2019!

Also, please note that on December 18, 2018, Swing [announced](https://www.soompi.com/article/1279701wpp/swing-entertainment-releases-official-statement-wanna-ones-contract-ending) that Wanna One will contractually be disbanded on December 31, 2018. However, all agencies came to an agreement that will allow all members to attend previously scheduled year-end shows and award ceremonies throughout January 2019. The group's final activity will be a concert (titled *Therefore*) held across four days, ending on January 27, 2019. They will then return to their respective agencies on January 28, 2019.

As in my other threads, anything not official confirmed via a label/contestant is either speculation or rumor and will be marked with an ""\*"" to note that.

If y'all see an update about a contestant or something I missed, please feel free to let me know and I'll update the OP!

Similarly, this caused fellow NU'EST members Kang Dongho, Kim Jonghyun, and Choi Minki (along with non-PD101 participant Kwak Aron) to promote as a subunit under NU'EST-W, effectively also going on hiatus from NU'EST until December 31, 2018.

The members were: Jin Longguo/Kim Yongguk (#21), Kwon Hyunbin (#22), Takada Kenta (#24), Roh Taehyun (#25), Kim Sanggyun (#26), and Kim Donghan (#29). Kim Taedong (#30) was slated to also be a member of JBJ, but due to a legal battle with his label at the time, he was unable to join the group.
* Jin Longguo/Kim Yongguk is currently in a pseudo hiatus since November 2018 due to [controversy](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/11/more-controversy-surrounding-kim-yong-guk-surfaces-including-derogatory-comments-about-jbj-promotions) stemming from posts on his private instagram account that got leaked to the general public and his [treatment](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/11/fans-are-more-concerned-about-kim-yong-guks-cat-lucy-than-his-dating-scandal-as-the-cat-was-recently-spotted-in-an-animal-shelter) of his [(now former)](https://www.soompi.com/article/1260901wpp/choon-entertainment-releases-official-statement-explaining-situation-longguos-cat-rcy) cat Rcy.
* Longguo &amp; Shihyun was a project unit created by Choon Entertainment. However, at this time both boys are n[ot confirmed](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/12/get-to-know-eson-jimyung-kyungheon-of-choon-entertainment-s-upcoming-boy-group-witz) to be part of Choon's upcoming five member boy group WITZ.
* Kwon Hyunbin is currently [co-managed](https://www.soompi.com/article/1132861wpp/jbjs-kwon-hyun-bin-jointly-managed-yg-entertainment-ygkplus) by both YG Entertainment and YGK+ as of February 2018.
* JBJ95 (which is made up of JBJ members Takada Kenta and Kim Sanggyun) was [confirmed](https://www.soompi.com/article/1196785wpp/kenta-kim-sang-gyun-debut-permanent-duo-taking-fan-ideas-group-names) in July 2018 to be a permanent group by both members.
* Kim Sanggyun originally debuted as a member of ToppDogg in 2014 and left the group prior to competing on PD101.
* Jang Moonbok originally [debuted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTkmHzA1yTM) as soloist in 2016.
* While not officially announcing a boy group/debut, ONO Entertainment [opened](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2018/12/03/ono-boyz-which-will-star-beautiful-boy-jang-moonbok-are-fucking-coming/) SNS accounts for ONO BOYZ in December 2018, which is made up of Jang Moonbok, Lee Hwichan (non PD101 participant), Yoon Heeseok (#46), and Seong Hyunwoo (#61). This indicates ONO is planning a boy group with at least these members.
* RAINZ was a project group created from contestants who placed did not place in the top 30. The members were: Seo Sunghyuk (#31), Hong Eunki (#38), Byun Hyunmin (#45), Kim Seongri (#47), Lee Kiwon (#53), Joo Wontak (#62), and Jang Daehyeon (#83).
* The East Light (Lee Woojin's group) were forcefully disbanded once two of the members (non PD101 participants Lee Seokcheol and Lee Eunsung) filed a lawsuit in October 2018 against the company [alleging](https://www.soompi.com/article/1247859wpp/east-lights-lee-seok-cheol-opens-recent-reports-abuse-take-legal-action) they received both mental and physical abuse from a producer and the CEO during their time in the company. The company [terminated](https://www.soompi.com/article/1249609wpp/the-east-light-agency-announces-termination-contracts-members) the contracts of the remaining members (including Woojin) soon after the allegations came to light.
* Park Woodam (#35), Woo Jinyoung (#40), and Jo Yonggeun (#93) initially debuted in June 2017 as part of Happyface Ent's pre-debut group HNB.
* Park Woodam  and Woo Jinyoung are two of the [currently ten members](https://onehallyu.com/topic/522404-%E2%AD%94-hnb-h-next-boys-%E2%80%A2-%E2%AD%94-support-kosuke-and-jungwoo-on-under19-%E2%AD%94-jinyoung-x-woodam-x-yoojun-you-are-beautiful-181202/) promoting as HNB. Due the pre-debut nature of the group, [no one](https://www.soompi.com/article/1236491wpp/happyface-entertainment-ceo-goals-behind-dreamcatchers-concept-plans-debut-boy-group-woo-jin-young) has been confirmed to be in the final lineup as of September 2018.
* Jeong Dongsu (#36) originally debuted in 2012 as a member of Offroad.
* Offroad seems to be de-facto on hiatus since at least 2017 as [two members](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8cznh3/threemember_boy_group_bnf_to_debut_on_april_20th/) (Jeong Dongsu and Kim Namhyun) are promoting as duo AA while the other three members are promoting as BNF. Offroad is not considered disbanded by S. How Entertainment, as their [official BNF twitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8cznh3/threemember_boy_group_bnf_to_debut_on_april_20th/) states that BNF is a subunit of Offroad while AA promotion schedules have been [posted on](http://cafe.daum.net/kairosoffroad) Offroad's official Daum cafe.
* GON Entertainment (Hong Eunki's label) [was merged](http://www.spotvnews.co.kr/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=163400) with CMH Entertainment in September 2017. The title of the article loosely translates to ""CMH merges with agency GON Entertainment (home of Hwang Bo and Hong Eunki). However, Eunki's official social media pages (and official YouTube channel) [do not](https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%99%8D%EC%9D%80%EA%B8%B0#fn-3) list any label - indicating that he might have left the label after the conclusion of RAINZ activities.
* Justin and Zhu Zhengting (JungJung) both participated in the Chinese ""knock-off"" Produce 101 series called *Idol Producer*, where they both made it into the final debuting group [Nine Percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Percent), placing 4th and 6th respectively. They will promote as part of Nine Percent for 1.5 years.
* While K-Tigers Zero technically debuted after the conclusion of ""[Shindong's Kick Service](https://www.soompi.com/article/1204179wpp/super-juniors-shindong-idols-participate-k-tigers-zeros-new-debut-project)"" reality show, no official updates about the group making a proper music debut has been announced. The [last update](https://www.youtube.com/user/Ktigerstkd/videos) about the group seems to be in September 2018.
* Kim Taewoo originally debuted in 2014 as a member of Rion Five.
* The status of Rion Five is [kind of up in the air](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/male_artist_profiles/r/rion-five-profile/). From what I could find, Narda Entertainment potentially no longer exists, and supposedly a message posted on their fancafe in August 2018 confirmed the group disbanded (but I haven't been able to find that message). However, footage of them performing in October 2018 surfaced so..I have no idea. Their Rion Five SNS hasn't been updated since 2017 at the latest and May 2018 at the earliest to promote T.E.N. and I don't have Weibo to check T.EN.'s status, so I haven't really been able to get updated information.
* T.E.N is a Chinese/Korean project group by Narda Entertainment and Ideal Media Group that includes Kim Taewoo and four other members of Rion Five (Narda) and five Chinese trainees (Ideal Media). The group debuted in May 2018.
* Kim Yongjin (#56) originally debuted as a member of Underdog, and left the group in 2016.
* Lee Insoo (#57) and Jeong Woncheol (#95) originally debuted as members of A6P in 2015, though the group disbanded in 2016.
* Kim Dongbin (#58) originally took a hiatus from Kiwi after being diagnosed with trauma induced depression. However, he [eventually rejoined](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/09/produce-101-season-2s-kim-dong-bin-heads-back-to-kiwi-media-group) the agency after seeking medical treatment and knowing Kiwi supporting him in treating his mental health.
* Ha Minho (#60) was [kicked off the show and had his contract terminated](https://www.soompi.com/article/982371wpp/produce-101-season-2-trainee-ha-min-ho-leaves-show-agency-ends-contract-following-controversy) by The Vibe Label/Major Nine in May 2017 due to allegations that he tried [to engage in sexual relationships with underage fans](https://www.soompi.com/2017/05/07/produce-101-season-2-contestant-ha-min-ho-allegedly-tries-engage-sexual-relationships-minors/)and[sexually harassed his ex-girlfriend in middle school](https://www.soompi.com/2017/05/07/produce-101-season-2-trainee-ha-min-ho-accused-bullying-sexually-harassing-ex-girlfriend/). His [official statement](https://www.soompi.com/article/1000435wpp/ha-min-ho-produce-101-season-2-posts-apology-sexual-harassment-controversy) confirmed that he did have ""inappropriate contact with fans"" but refutes the allegations that he tried to sleep with underage fans and that he sexually harassed his former girlfriend.
* Seong Hyunwoo (#61) has not technically debuted yet, but he [released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xer0eKW3cB8) his first song (as part of a collab with Jang Moonbok) in December 2017.
* A-Teen (Choi Dongha and Kim Chan's group) has yet to debut in Korea, and the group's current status is unknown. The group debuted in Japan in September 2018 with plans to debut in South Korea in 2019, but the [group's official SNS pages](https://www.allkpop.com/forum/threads/offical-debut-thread-ateen.209947/) haven't been updated since October 2018 and their official website is currently not accessible. So the group might potentially be disbanded.
* Jeong Joongji (#64) is...a hot ole mess since his time on Broduce. He was [accused](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/03/12/jung-joong-ji-of-produce-101-accused-of-sexual-harassment/) on sexual harassment in March 2017,  left WAYZ in May 2017 but *then* [accused](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/07/03/jung-joong-ji-of-produce-101-says-sexual-harassment-was-his-agencys-marketing-plan/) WAYZ of making up the allegations for ""noise marketing"", then got [sued](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/07/04/jung-joong-jis-agency-denies-fabricating-sexual-harassment-rumors-will-sue-him/) by WAYZ in July 2017 for defamation due to those claims, *then* after things seemed to cool down, decided to incur the wrath of Wannables in November 2017 (after he signed to a new label) by alleging that Jisung (of WO) [bullied](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2017/11/03/jung-joong-ji-of-produce-101-alleges-wanna-ones-yoon-ji-sung-bullied-him/) him throughout the recording of the show - something which was quickly refuted. I don't even know with this dude...
* ONEWE (Son Dongmyeong's band) originally debuted under the name M.A.S 0094 in 2015. The band (with the same members) went through a name change to ONEWE in 2018. The band [officially](https://kprofiles.com/onewe-members-profile/) began promoting as ONEWE in June 2018.
* Lee Seokyu (#69) was [added](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/seokyu-violently-beaten-group-members/) to Pure Boys in 2015, a year after the group debuted. The group temporarily disbanded later that year when 7 of the 10 members of Pure Boys left It Ent, forming their own company and group (called Naughty Boys). Lee Seokyu would later reveal that he was [the victim](https://www.soompi.com/article/971927wpp/produce-101-season-2-contestant-revealed-assaulted-group-members-last-year) of physical assault by three of the members in 2016 after the case was brought back to the news during the Broduce hype. The group would be rebooted near the end of 2015.
* While not officially confirmed, it seems likely that Choi Taewoong (#71) has left MMO in the time since Broduce concluded, as he does not list MMO on [his official instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm_SEi1Aevm/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1inh1996zw1jl), and has posted photos with non-MMO trainees in a practice room.
* Ha Minho (#74) debuted as a member of the rebooted Pure Boys in 2015.
* GNI Entertainment (Jeong Sihyun's company) [folded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broduce101/comments/676uk2/jeong_sihyun_is_without_a_company_after_gni_group/) in April 2017 due to fraud and embezzlement charges. This left Jeong Sihyun without a label by the time he was eliminated.
* I.ONE Entertainment (the home of Noir) changed their name to LUK Factory [sometime](https://onehallyu.com/topic/634318-concept-photos-from-upcoming-boygroup-noir-from-luk-factory/) after PD101 concluded.
* Choi Handon (#85) debuted as a member of JJCC in 2014. Kim Chanyul (#78) debuted as a member of JJCC when he was added the group's lineup in 2015. 
* Kim Jaehan (#81) originally debuted in 2015 as a member of duo OneVoices. However, the group disbanded in 2016. He re-debuted as a member of Spectrum in May 2018.
* Yoo Kyungmok (#84) originally debuted in 2011 in BoM (with Winner's Mino). The group disbanded in 2013 due to the company shutting down.
* It is unknown if Choi Junyoung (#90) is still with STL Ent., as he [does not](https://www.instagram.com/j_young1996/) list the label on his official instagram and is [not listed](http://www.stlent.co.kr/) as an artist on STL's website.
* Choi Junyoung debuted as a member of In4mal in 2015. He would later debut as a member of AFOS in 2016. though he would leave the group prior to competing on PD101.
* Park Heeseok (#86) and Kim Dohyun (#92) originally debuted in 2014 as duo X10. However, the group was disbanded before they competed in PD101.
* MY.st (Jeong Woncheol's group) [unofficially debuted](https://www.allkpop.com/forum/threads/upcoming-debut-my-st.157589/) in August 2018 in Japan, and have plans to eventually debut in South Korea.
* Choi Heeseo (#96) likely left LUK Factory prior to the debut of Noir as he was not included in the final lineup. His Korean wiki page lists his label as ""independent"" () and his [official instagram](https://www.instagram.com/he2_so0/) mentions no label.
* Lee Jihan (#98)'s label is currently unknown. His [unsourced](http://produce-101.wikia.com/wiki/Lee_Jihan) wikia page says he moved to WIDMAY, but his [Korean wiki](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%80%ED%95%9C) page has him still under Pan.
* Han Jongyeon (unranked) was put on a hiatus until he auditioned for MIXNINE due to a bullying controversy (which caused him to leave PD101). While Maroo [did confirm](https://www.soompi.com/article/962045wpp/han-jong-yeon-leave-produce-101-season-2-light-controversy-agency-explains) some of the bullying allegations, they denied the more ""heinous"" ones.",57,1,False,self,,,,,

2325,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2018-12-22,2018,12,22,7,a8evqx,self.kpop,"I love BTS, but I'm not ARMY",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a8evqx/i_love_bts_but_im_not_army/,LittleMissFischer,1545429660,"I love BTS, but I'm not an ARMY and this is my story about my journey through KPOP.

In the early spring of 2017 I discovered this wonderful thing called KPOP through my husband. He showed me an SNSD MV and I was drawn in by their synchronic dance moves and catchy songs. But what really got me hooked was when he showed me the boy groups. I fell in love with groups such as Super Junior and SHINee and I also liked Infinite's music and a bit of EXO. At first I only cared about the music and I didn't understand how people could learn all their names and all these facts about them. But as time moved on I got more interested in this community and I wanted to know more. I joined a Facebook group for KPOP fans and was looking forward to sharing this newfound hobby with someone and learn more about my favorite groups. But I soon found out I was several years too late in being a fan of SUJU and SHINee. The members of this Facebook group only talked about all these groups I'd never heard of and the most frequent group they mentioned was BTS. I even liked a few KPOP news forums on Facebook, but to my surprise, most articles were also about this BTS group.

So eventually I thought, why not sit down and give it a listen. Went on YouTube and chose the FIRE MV. I was blown away to be honest in a bad way. I did NOT like that music at all, they looked scary and weird to me, the MV was crazy and everything was just a big turn of for me. So I quickly turned it off and went back to my SUJU boys. 

Time passed by and I was slowly getting annoyed that all I got spammed with was these BTS boys, but then I came to learn that they had some sort of story time line and as a writer, that intrigued me a lot. So in one day I sat down and watched all the MV's to that timeline (released at that time) and I was so drawn in by the story. I was also shocked to hear songs as I NEED U, Butterfly and BST, which fitted my music genre much more. I started getting more and more drawn in, I learned their names faster than any other group and I soon found myself listening to them every day. I even listened to songs I didn't like such as their old stuff, FIRE, NOT TODAY and so on, because I told myself I would get used to it. And I did, after a while I could listen to any of their songs and I would say I liked it. I even listened to the Cyphers and as a person who've never liked rap, it was crazy to see how emerged I was in it.
I eventually learned of more groups and I became a huge multifandom but BTS were always my favorites. 

Then 2018 hit and as you all know, Burn The Stage series began and of course I had to watch it. But this was not a good thing for me. As a person who's suffered a lot from problems like stress, depression and anxiety, these small movies didn't do anything good for me. Seeing all their struggles being an idol made me feel guilty about being entertained by their struggles, how I enjoyed the music they was working so hard on, so hard it was draining their energy. I became sad, I became worried, worried about people I've never met before. Worried if they were sleeping enough? Drinking enough water? Getting enough to eat? As I saw I was getting into an unhealthy relationship with BTS I stopped watching the Burn The Stage series and haven't finished it and never will.

I felt so torn, so conflicted, I still watched everything BTS released but I wasn't happy, I kept worrying and I didn't enjoy listening to them or watching them like before. 

But then something happened. Day6 happened. Being on YouTube every day I sometimes just start a radio playlist and let YouTube chose what songs to listen to, and this kpop band? kept reappearing. I'd never heard of them before and didn't really care, but the song kinda grew on me and I eventually put the song ""Shoot Me"" on my playlist. I thought I should check out their other songs and I was blown away to be honest. In a good way. I was taken back to my younger days, to the music I used to listen to, and I felt like I had returned home. My playlist soon contained more and more Day6 and less and less BTS. I realized I'd been consumed by an obsession and I'd convinced myself that to be a fan of BTS I had to like EVERYTHING they made. I couldn't be critical of them, ever! And that was draining my energy alongside with my continuing worry for them. I started allowing myself to say which songs I liked and which songs I didn't, I allowed myself to see them as ""just a music group"" instead of idols or Gods. I started reminding myself that I don't know these people, even if there's millions of videos out there of them sharing their stories, we have no idea what they're really like. They show us what they want us to see, nothing more, nothing less. 

I have so many good people around me, so why was I obsessing over these Korean idols whom I would never met, when I could spend all my energy on those who truly love and know me. 

Now to the moral of this long story. BTS has done something amazing for me, they've broadened my music horizon, I still listen to the Cyphers and truly enjoy it, Suga is still my bias and I love when he raps, but I have lots of songs I'm not a fan of. I didn't like Fake Love that much, I did not like Idol at all and their old stuff is just not my cup of tea at all. I've come to realize that I'm not an ARMY. I will not give all my time and devotion to BTS when there are so many other artists out there who's music I like more, and I will not force myself to like whatever they release, I will allow myself to be critical. I will not watch all the videos of BTS giving intimate interviews or speeches as this leads me to worry about them and I do not want to spend my time worrying about people I will never met and will never have an influence on. I will listen to the music I like, watch the MV's I like, and view music like I used to, as something that can calm me when I want to relax, something that makes me want to dance, something that makes me happy, something that makes me cry, something I can enjoy without having all these rules about what to like and what not to like.

My answer:

Lack of English subs on videos/variety shows, it takes them 2-3 days to upload the English subs. Why can't they just release the episodes with English subs now that kpop has huge international following? It is really hard to avoid clips from the shows without subs on social media platforms.

The song is probably about love. (I don't understand Korean)

I remember that there was one band member playing the piano and one member playing the drums.

There is a scene that blossoms falling.

Most members wore white suits.

This band is consist of about four or five members.

The camera shook when the focus was on the member playing the drums.

The time of its releasing seems very close the time of the song ""not spring, love, or cherry blossoms"".

Examples:

Bang Yedam Theres Nothin Holdin Me Back
also Love Yourself

Park Jeong Woo When We Were Young 

Team Hui (Pentagon Maker) -See You Again

Team Kino (Pentagon Maker) -Sorry 

Kim Woojin-Lost Stars

Kim Seungmin-Stitches


These are just some of the examples from survival shows. Granted some of these the singer may not have chosen...but in general I notice a lot of English covers. Other than music from the west being popular, is there another reason? Do some of these English songs showcase vocal color more than others? I remember during a V Live Doyoung mentioned that he thought there was a certain color in English songs that Korean songs didnt have, but that he was changing his mind about it and now he preferred Korean songs.

I am doing some research and need some insights in the K-Pop industry :),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a8o0ds/hey_rkpop_i_am_doing_some_research_and_need_some/,RYU___,1545509492,"Hi my name is Luc and i recently started investing myself in Korean culture. I am fascinated by their entertainment industry format because it is so different from what i was used too. (general western, I'm from the EU)

I'm aspiring to become a journalist and share stories and different cultures with people unfamiliar to it. (i Will be starting my Bachelor in Journalism next year)

&amp;#x200B;

I would love it if some people and maybe natives from Korea can give me some insights on how the Entertainment Industry works and help me out in my research.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my main questions:

1. I heard that Production companies have try-outs and bootcamps before they debut a group, starting sometimes at a very young age. How does this work in general? is it like a 1D thing were Simon Cowell just put them together after their auditions for i think it was X-Factor?
2. I also heard many different stories about the freedom the ''idols'' have and that it sometimes is a bit limited... how does that work?
3. What is the most Important aspect in Kpop, the music, dance or video(visuals)? and Why is their such an heavy focus on the video's and choreography? 
4. Kpop fans are very different from fans of other genres. with their fandoms and all, how does this come to be?
5. Why do artists alwatys have multiple ''comebacks'' of mini albums and a video instead of releasing a full album every year or 2 with 1 or 2 music videos? for ex. BlackPink started in 2016 i believe...? and they have 9 original songs on their spotify right now. 
6. How much control do Production companies have over their artists? to what extend? i heard that some idols are not even allowed to date but idk if that is true haha.
7. What are the biggest Prod. Comps right now and what kind of good/bad reputations do they have?
8. If someone could tell me a bit about the style/fashion aspect of this subculture that would be nice, i'm not as invested in that but still interested.

Well that is it i guess, my biggest questions. i have more but i do not want to bore you guys with all my unknowingness.

The thought just occurred to me that if I were an idol, I would be very, very nice to staff on variety shows, just so that they would make me look good even when I put my foot in my mouth--as I probably would do very often.  And that got me thinking even further about it, like if I were a k-pop idol, I would probably be...

* the main vocalist (I can't sing, but in a kpop-au...probably?)
* probably the leader of the group (I have a tendency to be the oldest in any given friend group, and I know age isn't the only factor in being a leader but still)
* be known to fans as the clumsy one with a weird sense of humour (think a cross between BTS' Jin and SHINee Onew)
* either be a hit or miss on variety shows, depending on the energy of that particular shoot (have you seen CNBLUE on Weekly Idol? Think that...)
* never be pictured outside 'cause I would spend all my time at home when not working (Jung Yonghwa once said that and it has remained in my mind because same)
* very active on social media (because I'm less awkward online than in person)
* ~~make my love for SHINee known so that becomes one of my defining features~~

Casey Frey, a groundbreaking comedian and dancer who is well-known for his dance vines back in the days and his hilarious [can i sing 4 u?](https://youtu.be/M87XIDYFR-E) video, recently opened up in expressing his support for Yao MingMing, who will be participating on the second of the successful Chinese survival show, Idol Producer. 

Born in Shanxi, China, Yao MingMing is a former Pledis &amp; FNC GTC trainee and ex-member of the now disbanded group BLK. He also participated in YGs reality-talent survival show Mix Nine, finishing at rank 10 disrespectively. Later on he continued promoting as a member of BLK, making a heart-stopping appearance at KCON Japan. 

Back when he trained in Pledis, he was originally set to debut as a member of Seventeen, then he left in mid-2014, later opening an Instagram account. He trained at FNC GTC for a while then joined ByKing Entertainment, debuting with BLK. After undergoing many conflicts with their agency, it was later confirmed that BLK disbanded. 

Shortly afterwards, he signed with One Cool Jacso Entertainment, an agency based in Hong Kong (also where famous actor Louis Koo is from) and is set to compete in Idol Producer. 

What do you guys think?  Omg I think its so amazing that support for MingMing has grown immensely. It is such an honor to have someone like Casey Frey openly expressing his adoration for MingMing.  It means a LOT to me. Glad to see that folks from different walks of life are gathering together to support MingMing.  

After all hes been through these years, he really deserves the encouragement. Please remember to vote for Yao MingMing on Idol Producer S2!

If so, who are they?

For me, its Jung Sewoon, Kevin from tbz, and Eunwoo + Kyla from Pristin

 Jung Sewoon - 

he just gives off this real, authentic vibe. like a neighbor next door. I feel like hes very genuine &amp; humble and that's why I admire him. You dont see many ppl like him in kpop. many idols are the same old same old trying to show how ""cute"" or how ""sexy"" they are and blah blah. they're often put in a box and they stick to it. but sewoon is different. he knows what works best for him &amp; works independently. but at the same time he isn't afraid to try new things every once in a while and get outta his comfort zone. that's what makes him stand out. he can be a pop icon and he can be a humble boy-next-door at the same time. he's very calm and reassuring to the ones closest to him. he's always open to learning new things, and he's passionate about what he does. he radiates positive, optimistic energy

 Kevin from tbz -

Im not an avid follower or stan of tbz; but I really admire Kevin because hes quite outspoken and knows how to connect with his fans. Hes open about his love for beyonce and other pop music (like, omg same sis!!!) and he knows what goes on in twitter...I swear Im pretty sure he has a hidden fan account...he knows all the slang we use. Hes SUPER funny and down-to-earth. Im glad someone like him exists in kpop. Tbz in general have amazing songs and personalities lol. 

 Eunwoo and Kyla from Pristin

Eunwoo is super goofy and memey. She has a lovable personality. She also loves her fellow members a lot and seems more open about how she feels. And Kyla cuz she knows when to take the time off for herself and isnt afraid to be seen doing things others do. (working, going to carnivals, etc...) her siblings are quite off-putting to me but Kyla herself is chill and unbothered.

Personally, I think [Love In The Ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy0NCbE-9XA)  Mixnine performance was one of the best vocal renditions of the song.

Lately, I've been seeing a lot of kpop fans do ""make for make"" agreements where they'll sign each other's campaigns. And even though I think it's really nice to see everyone helping each other out I can't help but think how this won't actually be beneficial since it skews management's perception of how much interest there is in a certain location. There's people who sign them with no intention of wanting to see the artist, so I feel like for smaller groups it could end up being more of an expense. (Although if anyone has more knowledge or experience with MMT you can feel free to correct me!)

For me is SM rapping. Now hold up, I dont claim any of them as rappers or even that SM rapping is very good. I just think its decent, gets the job done and isnt worth all the venom and shade that gets flung its way. We all know SM is a vocals focused company. The raps in these songs are hardly ever the focus and shouldnt even be paid that much attention, other than it maybe being a short quick break in the song. They mostly just sound like quick feature parts. Nothing outstanding but not usually ever offensively bad. And when they are bad at least we get good long lasting memes. 

But I guess what Im saying is what probably puts me in the minority is that I would hate to see them removed from songs and filled with more vocals instead. ",143,1,False,self,,,,,

If you apply the 10% shipping coupon, it will take $13 off. There is no overall tax if you live in the US(?).

Depending on where you will be shipping to the final price will differ. You have two choices for shipping, Priority Mail or Flat Rate Priority Mail. There's a shipping calculator on the website and it asks for State, City and Zipcode. To give you a general idea of the shipping costs, I used the addresses of the venues:

Indio, CA  92203 

* Priority Mail: $9.85
* Flat Rate: Priority Mail: $18.90

San Jose, CA  95113 

* Priority Mail: $10.95 
* Flat Rate: Priority Mail: $18.90

Houston, TX  77057 

* Priority Mail: $18.70 
* Flat Rate: Priority Mail: $18.90

Atlanta, GA  30309 

* Priority Mail: $23.15
* Flat Rate: Priority Mail: $18.90

Chicago, IL  60614 

* Priority Mail: $20.65
* Flat Rate: Priority Mail: $18.65

So, for example, if you happened to live in Chicago at the zip code 60614 and you chose the Flat Rate Priority Mail for shipping, your total would look like this:

* Now, now before you all start attacking me, I want to clarify that I am not saying that they shouldnt have a relationship together. Because, I dont care, they can do whatever they want. 
* But we need to keep in mind that HyunA have been in the kpop industry ever since debuting in Wonder girls then when they disband she was talented enough to debut solo, and of course through promoting and being active she must have earned enough to have a sustainable life without being an idol. 
* However, thats not the case for her boyfriend who was in Pentagon, a group that debuted for only 2 years. A group that only got their big hit this year, which was going to kick start the group and really start earning money. But Edawn was kicked out before that could ever happen. 
* This is also unfair to the group that is now left behind and dealing with the aftermath of having one of their most popular member leave the group

1. Ikon shouldnt have made the song love scenario

* I love love scenario, it made me start listening to other ikon songs and really get deep into the group. 
* However, as we can see with EXOs Growl, their debut song that blew up overnight and made them the top boy group that they are. However EXO was always compared to their prime time which was their debut song. And it was definitely going to be more famous and popular than other songs. Other people said that they should made a song that is just as famous but it some situations it is almost impossible
* Ikon may gain a bit of popularity from love scenario but we can see that this popularity was very much short lived. Seeing their view count for all the MVs they released after love scenario. Yeah things doesnt seem to be doing well...i have some theories on that so if you want to hear it, please comment down below.

1. EXO should have had a comeback months ago

* Kpop this is year have become a really popular topic, many more groups are able to to perform on american stages and yet
* SM didnt take this opportunity for EXO. Maybe the members were busy doing individual things, such as the members acting career, which I must say, is really good. But to delay something so much so that almost no award shows are counting their comeback album in any of the category is very...disappointing. 
* Or maybe SM was too focused on red velvet comeback and NCTs comebacks (I can also talk about why Red velvet is probably not going to have a great year next year) Who knows. The biggest problem I have of this is that fans arent going to stay loyal. Especially the new international fans, they will always stick to the group that are the most active and entertaining. EXO has all the skills and talent but just a terrible entertainment to take care of them. 

1. NCT should not have new members for the time being

* There are 18 members in NCT as a fan for them since they debuted. It is still sometimes very confusing for me to know each of the names of the members and pretty much anything about them
* It may be because I dont always watch their videos but my situation with NCT is probably the same for a lot of other people who are still getting to know NCT
* Having members without fans truly understanding and cherishing the original members makes the whole concept of NCT having sub units and also a overall group that has strong bonds. 
* Having new members I think would just mean more chaos.

1. BTS shouldnt have had a world tour and also a comeback at the same time

* I literally predicted BTSs burn out last year. Becuase I feel like there is a saying in the kpop world where you might think your idol is taking a rest but actually they are working hard on other side projects, this statement is very much true in the contex of BTS who have been working every hour for the whole year
* Jins speech didnt suprise me because OF course they were going to be tired and mentally exhausted. This pressure and everything for BTS to further develop themselves and please fans is almost impossible to do.
* They had a comeback of answer but didnt expect to have any performances, but changed their minds because a lot of fans were disappointed.
* They worked so hard that they didnt realise that they were mentally exhausted until it was too severe. 
* I think BTS should take a long haitus and everyone should support them for it

1. Blackpink members should not be debuting solo

* Having debuted only for a short period of time, and all the members have unique voice and personality. This raises a question of if they are all so different how is a fan able to like all of the members. Which is why blackpink fandoms are always going to complaining about which member YG is being bias towards. Or which member is the most talented. 
* Not having a united fandome is a problem which easily causes instability
* And now they are going solo, which drives the members and fans even further away

1. American media should stop comparing every kpop group that goes to america to BTS

* The media need to understand BTS isnt the only kpop group just as no singer in america represent the whole american music culture 
* Maybe it is because they want their interview to get more attention by putting BTS into it. But to other fandoms it is just plain rude and undermines everything the kpop group that is getting interviewed have done.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

People can still be a fan even if they dont like one of the members. I usually have one because its just my habit (that I really hate) that I have to not like at least one person in a group


For me:
Siwon- I used to not like him because I got into super junior by heechul and it annoyed me when people said siwon was better looking than heechul( you know, when you dont find someone good looking but other people do so you start to think they are really ugly). Now, I like him as much as any other member. Super junior is the only group I Stan where I like all of the members equally.
Jae Hyun- I have tried so hard to like him because I want it to be like super junior where I like everyone but I just cant. His reason is like siwon except I always siwon was good looking just not better looking but Jaehyun, doesnt look anything special to me. People always talk about his visuals so much.
Top- he is probably the person in kpop I dislike the most. He is the same reason as Jae hyun but he also has another reason. To me, he just seems so arrogant. I was watching a clip of winner tv(I am a fan of g dragon and he was in the clip) and I noticed that Top was literally sitting on the couch wearing sunglasses and not speaking at all to any of the winner members. No one in the comment section even noticed that. I also dont like his kind of humor.

I know that if I met any of these people in real life, I wouldnt hate them and yada yada so guys dont take any of this seriously.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

I havent seen anyone do a post about it so I thought many army's would like to see this. Basically this youtube channel is coming up on many peoples recommended but when they click on the video it says unavailable, weird right.
Well what's even more strange was that it was created shortly after ly:her was released yet it didnt start to appear to fans on the recommended page until nowand when some fans search for the channel some cant find it. Idk it's strange, most people think it means bts' next concept will have something to do with speaking yourself and that means the un speech was a bug hint. But the channel art also included some + signs which does have some meaning but I can't remember the theories about that sorry.
well anyway here's the link incase you can't find it

I can't say that I ever noticed that one member's outfits were consistently better/prettier/more unique than everyone else's though there's definitely a trend with often dressing Hyoyeon in a generally more sporty/badass way and Yoona in a more traditionally feminine way 

Also with the Jenny controversy going on I noticed some comments stating that she gets outfits that make her stand out while the other members are styled similarly as if they are back dancers. While one video does support that argument I don't think any of their other performances really do. Again there's definitely a trend with Jenny and Lisa getting more weird/fashionable outfits (Jennie's bodysuit under a skirt, Lisa's pants inside pants) but I acn't say that I see a bias.

Have you noticed any bias in styling when it comes to your bias group? Or any trends?",130,1,False,self,,,,,

1. BTS
2. EXO
3. GOT7

Girl Groups :
1. Twice
2. BLACKPINK
3. Red Velvet

I know people will argue on Wanna One and I.O.I, but regardless of their success I think their status as a temporary group was detrimental to their overall impact. If they were permanent groups I think they would have won over GOT7 and Red Velvet, but unlike the latter two they were unable to showcase long term success due to the contract.

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**The Rose Special Photobook Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_therose_3/)

* Date Project Ends: December 25, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is The Rose?

The Rose is a 4 male rock band from J&amp;Star Entertainment. They debuted in August 2017 with the single ""[Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXcpLWB2eBA)"". According to OneHallyu, the group writes, composes, and arranges their own songs. The groups name is said to come from the idea that there are many different color roses, so the group wants to be like a rose and show off many different musical colors. The fandom name is Black Rose.

The group previously ran [two very successful Makestars](https://www.makestar.co/projects?brandIdx=9) to fund their previous albums, grossing 1305.1% and 618.9% respectively.

The Rose's most recent comeback was earlier this month, with the song ""[She's in the Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfucEdhdo8U)"" off their second mini-album *Dawn*. However, due to recent controversy over the use of SHINee's Jonghyun's personal instagram photos without getting permission caused the MV to be deleted, with J&amp;Star Ent offering an apology for the error.

While I couldnt verify the information, the info section of the groups OH thread says that Doojoon, Jaehyeong, and Hajoon met via busking (they started performing under the name Windfall), and Woosung was offered the chance to join by Doojoon due to hearing about his music skills via a mutual friend. Funnily enough, Woosung was a trainee at J&amp;Star preparing for a solo debut, but brought up the band concept to the labels CEO, and after a successful performance by the 4 members, the CEO signed the remaining 3 and formed The Rose.

* Date Project Ends: December 27, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Camila?

Camila is a three member girl group signed to C-C Entertainment.

The group's gimmick is being a group with ""no manager and no agency"", as C-C Ent. was started by group leader Han Choim. The group's name comes from the mythological character from Virgil's *Aeneid.* You can read more about the character's fascinating history by clicking [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_(mythology))

Both Choim and member Yu Been have had industry experience in the past, as both members were former members of LAYSHA, with Yu Been also being a member of the now disbanded 1NB under the name of Jung Yu.

Camila debuted in August 2018 with the song ""[Red Lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atgMIE_NCmM)"", and this project is for their follow up comeback.

* Date Project Ends: December 31, 2018

So if you'd like to know more about the group, you can check out their [wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIA_(band))

Member Ahra also participated on the final season of *Superstar K*, where she made it to the semi-finals before getting eliminated. Her most notable performance was with another *Mix Nine* contestant Lee Soomin, performing Jessie J's ""[Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riHBLS8NHyo)"".

They previously ran a [successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_favorite/) for their 2nd mini album *Love Loves To Love Love*, raising 215% above their goal. The title track off that album ""Where are you from?"" was their most recent comeback.

[**Newkidd's Debut Support Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_newkidd_01/)

* Date Project Ends: January 8, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Newkidd?

Newkidd is a six member boy group signed to J-Flo Entertainment.

While the group hasn't ""officially"" debuted, the group has released music under two different subunits. The first subunitto  debut, Newkidd - Lemme Spoil U (which consisted of Jinkwon, Ji Hansol, Yunmin, and Woochul), debuted on November 30, 2017 with the song ""[Will You Be Ma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxcB6PnDIls)"".

The group's second subunit, Newkidd02 (which consisted of Jinkwon, Ji Hansol, Yunmin, Woochul, Choi Jiann, and Hwi), debuted in July 2018 with the song ""[Shooting Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh_hrg_Djdo)"". This subunit actually includes Newkidd's debut lineup, so I'm unsure why they promoted as a subunit first when the final lineup is exactly the same...

In any case, both Ji Hansol and Choi Jiann are the most well known from the group, as Hansol was a long time SM rookie who left SM in 2017. He eventually competed in *The Unit,* where he placed 6th and ended up promoting as a member of project group UNB.

Choi Jiann, meanwhile, is a Produce 101 alum. He participated in the competition under his real name (Choi Jaewoo) representing Rainbow Bridge World. He placed 97th in the competition.

It doesn't necessarily have to be crazy, if you think that it's interesting, share it.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I came across this [Peek-A-Boo M/V theory](https://youtu.be/R5-CMGBzzIE?t=325) video on You Tube. The theory is that the girls are supernatural creatures who are not afraid of anything and are masters at tricking other people (pizza boys in this case) and killing them. They don't need to eat anything, that's why they are always playing with food (putting diamonds on pizzas, making pizza houses, shooting apples etc.). They hunt the delivery boys once a month when the full moon appears, they let him escape when he comes the first time because it is not a full moon as it can be seen from the window, they choose him as a victim. They casually train with dangerous weapons and make a plan to kill him the next time he arrives.

Wendy is the leader because she is the only one wearing odd coloured dress in the group.Finally, the pizza boy arrives at the house when the full moon is up, they trap and play psychological games with him (the one with the green jelly). In the end they make him believe that one of the members is helping him escape but Yeri ends up shooting him with the bow before he can contact anyone from the pay phone. They get rid of all the evidence and collect the pizza boy t shirt as a trophy.

It's really cool to see what takes people had initially, and how the opinion/legacy of a song transformed today. It makes me think of how songs that are released today are going to be viewed in a few years. For instance, here are some reactions to ""I Got a Boy"", which is typically highly lauded today as a classic kpop/SNSD song, when it came out 5 years ago:

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm so confused. ;\_\_; Like, it felt like 6 different bits of songs smashed together. Hot mess.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I feel like if I say I genuinely like the song, I'll just be written off as a blind sone who likes anything SNSD does

...but I really did like it ;\_;""

&amp;#x200B;

""Clusterfuck. Some parts of it could've made a good song, but there's actualy too LITTLE repetition. The backgroundmusic @ 2:05-2:52 is terrible to say the least.""

&amp;#x200B;

""SM fucked this one up badly.""

&amp;#x200B;

tend to be very negative, which is something that really surprises me. Just goes to show how with time styles and opinions can change!

What reactions do you find interesting/what do you think the videos/songs of today will be remembered for in 5-10 years?

The intro portion of the song can sound familiar due to the similarities in genre and guitar riffs, but the melody and chord progression are completely different [from Mi Mi Mi].
It seems that the misunderstanding arose from the fact that the bass line and 4-measure chord progression [used in the song] are common characteristics of the retro house and swing electronic genre."" 
What's your opinion on cases like this and producers denying that it is not a rip off.



[Sunmi - Heroine comparison with Cheryl Cole - Fight for this love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB514TZGuqk&amp;app=desktop). Teddy's production company The Black Label released a statement

""Heroine is 100 percent an original creative work with absolutely no reference to the song that has been named in the controversy.

What's your stance on this?

YG seems like the worst currently and 2NE1 going in on them shows their true nature. Doesn't help that Blackpink seems to be going the same path as 2NE1 but at an accelerated rate. 

  
JYP is the next worst I think. They have had a lot of controversy in the past. They seem to be getting slightly better while YG is getting worse. Currently though it seems TWICE is being worked to hell and back, but Stray Kids seem to be fine, granted they're pretty new.

SM I guess is the best? EXO and Red Velvet seem to be pretty content overall but we don't know if they're hiding behind a mask.

But thinking about it, I wonder if Momoland will ever be as famous as they were before baam and if gfriend will ever recover from the downhill ride since fingertip. 

And it settles on what it is exactly that each individual group has to do to stay on top of the game, and the differences for the things that worked for different groups. Like, for Blackpink it works that they have barely no songs, while Twice has a lot of them, and although they are ranked different between girl groups, they are top girl groups nonetheless, despite the incredibly different promotions approach.

For NCT people almost unanimously say Taeyong is their favorite visual. But for me I find Taeil the most handsome.

In EXO I feel like its between Sehun or Chanyeol. But I love me some Chen.

Seventeens most popular visual member is Mingyu but I like DK.

Almost everyone says Sana or Tzuyu for Twice but omg Jihyo is so beautiful to me.

I feel like people rank her last in Red Velvet but I find Wendy stunning.

Maybe I just have a thing for vocalists?? Haha. Im not saying any of these people are ugly. If they were walking around the street I would probably stop in my tracks and gaze at them in awe. But I feel like on the list of visuals for their groups they rank pretty low :/ ",487,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm curious to see what everyone's number one pick is, feel free to hit me with a top 5 or top 10 if you feel up to it. 

Some guidelines: 
1. Separate drafts for boy and girl idols.

2. Age matters! While someone like Irene (Red Velvet) would definitely be a solid choice, the fact that she's already 27 might cause some people to think about picking someone with more years ahead of them. (no hate)

3. For guys it's almost the opposite. Maybe it's worth it to pick an older idol who is done/almost done with enlistment versus someone you're going to lose for a few years down the road. 

4. Try to avoid soloists unless they're more known for their group work. Jennie counts, IU doesn't. Singers like Chungha are more of a grey area so I'll leave it up to you.

5. This is just for fun, there's no right or wrong answers. 

A few of my own choices would be -

Jennie (blackpink)
Age - 22
Pros - pretty popular, speaks english, good all-around talent (visual, vocal, rap)
Cons - the recent lazy dancing/lack of effort drama, associated with YG

Sejeong (ioi, gugudan)
Age - 22
Pros - amazing vocal (in my opinion), good at variety (go watch Busted! on netflix) leadership skills
Cons - it seems like some of the hype she had from ioi has cooled down a bit with gugudan not really taking off (i could be wrong)

Ill start:


1) I know this sub loves Red Velvet, so go easy on me. For me, I dont get the huge hype for Red Velvet. The only member thats interesting for me to watch is Seulgi. I cant get into their music and when I do, like with Bad Boy, it gets old very very quickly.

2) Kpop song writers should either stop adding English into the songs or hire someone who speaks English as a first language. A lot of the English phrases are just...bad. Im looking at you, Teddy.

3) YG purposely gives Blackpink no content or promotion because if he starves the fandom and then gives them a little material, even if its not the best quality, the fandom eats it up and goes insane over it. He knows how badly Blinks want BP content and hes taking advantage of the fact that he could release audio of Jennie calling everyone poor while Ros farts and it would dominate the charts. 

4) F(x) deserves better. Im assuming that SM is putting their focus for their unconventional songs to Red Velvet since RV is doing so well, but then where does that leave F(x)?

5) Twice WANT to have all of these comebacks. They constantly say it on V-live. 

6) I dont understand the Somi hype. Is it the childish voice? Is it that shes Canadian and has more western features? 

7) I hate the focus on how skinny idols have to be. 

8) Leave idols alone when theyre serving in the military. Have some respect. What happened to GD was disgusting.

9) Blackpink couldnt succeed in 2NE1s shadow if both groups were active at the same time.

10) Dreamcatcher is underrated.

11) I wish Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears blew up internationally instead of Fake Love. 

12) I really liked Signal. Sue me.

13) Like Ooh Ah is my favorite song from Twice. Sue me again.

14) 2019 is the year that stylists actually take into consideration that idols are dancing in these short ass uncomfortable outfits. Do better. 

15) CLC wouldnt have done as well with LVER than IZ*ONE. 

16) The rock version of I Dont Care by 2NE1 is better than the original.

17) Soyeon is the next CL. We stan a charismatic queen.

Taemin-14
IU-15
Sohyun-14

What are your thoughts? How do you think debuting so early on affected these idols and the trajectory of their careers? Were they just too talented to wait any longer?

The idol life is already harsh on anyone who chooses to embark on that journey, but I cant imagine what it looks to deal with that as a teenager. There is already so much going on with changes in your development and its already kind of an angsty time for a lot of us. But to add on the stress of being in the public eye and having millions and millions of eyes on you. Man I just cant even imagine.

As you know, idols can't really date without delusional k-fans getting their panties in a bunch, so they're forced to hide it or are banned from doing it at all, just because fans want to act like kpop idols are theirs when in reality their idol doesn't even know their name. People seem to forget that idols are normal human beings with normal human emotions, including attraction and love. Instead they just want their idols to keep singing, dancing and blow kisses to them from behind the camera. It really shouldn't be this way. And ik it's also the fault of the company for marketing idols in a certain way but honestly I just wish this would change so that idols wouldn't feel scared to admit to relationships and stuff.

Not only can he do impressions, he's also a fairly good rapper, dancer, and singer for the most part. He's also a pretty good songwriter in my opinion, one of them successfully getting an all-kill and receiving best rock song at the 9th MMAs (Sweet Dreams). He's also a half decent actor.

Honestly, if Heechul was to leave SM, I don't think he'd find problems with signing up with any agency he wants. He can do variety, he can write songs, sing, dance, act. I'd think he's worth quite alot and SM did a really good job at investing in him.",11,1,False,self,,,,,

1: I dont like Jennies solo debut.
             This is most likely because Im dissatisfied in her lines. I wish she used more Korean in solo because its called K-POP for a reason. No shade, I love Jennie, but I wish her company didnt give her such large amounts of English.

2: I dont understand why bts is so popular.
          Ok dont get me wrong, bts is FIRE (haha get it?) but I never understood why they are nationally the most popular K-POP group. This is because there are so many more talented groups that deserve way more attention than they are getting. Like bts is overshadowing them, and getting awards, while other groups are just as talented.

3: Momoland is NOT disrespectful.
           Ok so Im gonna spill the tea.... in my opinion only Nancy is disrespectful. Netizens are making it seem like momoland AS A GROUP have bad behavior. Nancy is the only one who needs to fix her act. (Sometimes JOOE can be, but her bubbly personality is hard to hold back.) yet again, dont get me wrong, Nancy is amazing! I just am underwhelmed by her behavior lately.

4: Sana should be the main vocal in twice.
      This is just based on my taste of vocal. In my opinion sana is the most diverse and unique singer, and I think she deserves more lines. Although Jihyos voice is Phenomenal, I still feel like Sana is more stable. (AND SANAS HIGH NOTES)

5: Nancy is not visual.
            Yes Nancy is STUNNING. But she doesnt meet Koreans beauty standards. I feel like just because she is gaining more success, MLD entertainment has given her more accomplishments or specialties to draw even more attention. I feel like yeonwoos visual deserves more attention. (Jeez I just wish MLD ENT. Would pay more attention to less popular members.)

Disclaimer: If this isn't allowed by the sub mods, I'll delete this asap.

How are the generations of kpop defined?
The first gen had groups such as HOT., Fin. K. L., S. E. S., etc., second gen had groups such as SNSD, Big Bang, WG, 2PM, etc., and 3rd gen had groups such as Twice, BTS, Exo, Red Velvet, etc. How were these generations defined, was it based on a couple of years only then you immediately move on to the next generation? Were they defined by the change in the music style? What was the explanation behind these generations? 

And one more question, has the fourth generation of kpop already started? Are the groups 'leading' it, groups such as (G)I-DLE, Loona, Stray Kids, NCT, etc.? Or are the mentioned groups still part of the third generation? 

Once again, if the mods are bothered by this, I'll remove it, but if anyone decides to answer to this, any explanation would be greatly appreciated. ",3,1,False,self,,,,,

Some great music overall though that has been released this year:

ATEEZ: Pirate King

NCT: Boss, Baby Dont Stop, Regular, Simon Says

SF9: Now Or Never

Cross Gene: the whole Zero album tbh

MONSTA X: Shoot Out, Jealousy

Park Bom, Eunjung too but none of the mentioned comes close in my opinion to the Chinese singer: Gem (google her if you don't know her). I have a feeling Kpop doesn't focus too much on singing abilities and rapping/dancing is the ever-growing main focus.

1. Kim Junkyu, he reminds me a lot of myself. I suffer from a lack of confidence as a result of getting harsh criticism in singing just like Junkyu did, so his ""backstory"" and him overcoming his anxiousness while performing better has really helped me realize that I can't be stuck in the mindset that I was in. He's also one of my favorite vocalists in YGTB, he seems genuinely happy performing, and he's such a meme I love him.

2. Choi Hyunsuk, I feel like he deserves to debut. He originally WAS supposed to debut in MIXNINE (but well... it's yg), he's one of my favorite rappers out of all the trainees, he is sometimes ""extra"" in performing, but I think that's better than being bland while performing. He also has a really nice personality, he's fun, caring and very amusing, he would do great in the spotlight. 

3. Yedam - I'm pretty sure 98% of the fans are rooting for him so i'll keep this one short, he's insanely talented (he's only a year older than me??) and has been kept in the YG dungeon too long. 

4. Mashiho - I honestly didn't really notice him much until the episode where he was up against Seunghun in the 1v1 battle. When I watched that, I CANT BELIEVE I SLEPT ON HIM. His vocals are amazing and his stage presence is no joke.

Then you will find this post really interesting who knows it might even help you solve your obsession problem.

There are a lot of crazy things that goes on in your brain it can be a good thought, a crazy thought, an amazing idea, stupid idea and also sometimes stuff which are truly offending to the human society(*you know what I mean!*). So our thoughts are the most important thing in our life, it literally decides our present future and everything else(*I know*)! So what I mean is obsessions are due to the the feelings that we have on somebody or something.We can never figure out an obsession in its early stages because usually small actions that are performed by individuals become a habit and later turns out to be an obsession, the heart breaking truth is that we can never figure out an obsession before it becomes an obsession.

Before jumping into depth of this article this is not related to any medical OCD kind of obsession or obsessions among people with disturbed mental state but normal obsession over a person or a thing among us commoners.According to my self realization there are so many ways you get into any obsession lets see about each of them and later on see if there are any solutions.Firstly one main reason for an obsession over an actor,single or a social personality can come from PROCRASTINATION!! *Yes you read it right*.Around 70 to 75% of today's population are suffering from procrastination syndrome where it can be a student who delays to complete his/her homework, project, preparing for a test or an exam and also for interviews.More about this can be seen in the below mentioned video where he talks about procrastination.

[Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)

So how is this related to obsessions?Yes, it is in order to delay the start of your work because you are very bored to do that work makes you watch videos, movies or series and also see popular music videos. In this thousands of thousands of videos, one or the other video catches your attention and then you listen/see it again until you are satisfied.....after some time you want to still procrastinate so you google about that video/song/actor/singer .After knowing more about that song or actor comes ally of most problems, PEOPLE'S BIGGEST ENEMY IN THEIR LIVES ""GOOGLE"" gives us recommendations where its either related to that song or other videos of that actor/singer or also may be similar videos.I cannot believe how technology can change the way we work, think and also things we do.Its like technology is controlling human's life and not the vice versa! OK, lets talk about that issue some other time.So, this is how procrastination can lead to obsession.

The next reason is because of your own interest but there is positivity in these kinds of obsession because its something you would do even without compulsion or influence and so it is not momentary it makes us discover many other genres under that interest, makes you define your future career so its called passion rather than obsession.There is a small line between obsession and passion.                                  How do you differentiate between these healthy and unhealthy obsession.We say its a healthy obsession if it helps us improve, makes us steady, makes us bold in difficult situation and also the most important one, rather than the other things motivating us for our daily lives it teaches you to self motivate ourselves makes our everyday and moment count.Obsessions which stops us from doing our daily jobs, even though there is no logic it makes us believe in things which just makes our feelings happy,(For example you would have broken up with your boyfriend or girlfriend watching somebody who is similar to your ex or a movie which is sort of similar to your life where your ex is ideal ) so it make you stick to that moment because you don't want to move on it make us get stuck at that moment so we don't think about future we cannot live without such obsessions, these kind of obsessions are extremely unhealthy.   There is also one more kind called fake obsession which is similar to social conformity where you agree with your group because everyone in the group agrees.In a fear of becoming an outcast, if your group is obsessed with a band it makes you also to get obsessed over that band .

What made me think so deeply about obsession is, me as a person who tries to understand everything around me,trying to find a logical reason about everything, was obsessed over a simple thing which didn't have any logical explanation which made me think about why people get obsessed to a point where they cannot live without it.You might find answers on wikihow on how to get over an obsession over a person or a thing but **what you won't find is about the obsession over a kpop artist**. Now let's dig in deep with the overrated obsession of people over actors/singers. Recently when I was going through my twitter and Instagram since I'm a music person so obviously I click on music genre while searching, what was so much like a blow/hit on my face kind of truth was it was flooded with kpop posts.Initially I was irritated to see so many of them and also only about them it wasn't something I was looking for...then I shut my phone off thinking it was of no use because they are trending everywhere which is something media calls a ""Korean wave"". Even though I didn't go through it in detail what grabbed my attention was the fan base that they had it was Global. Every country had a group of these crazy, most dedicated and determined fan base that I had never seen with other artists which made me think ""why are they so famous"" that they even spoke in UN general assembly in UN youth strategy2030 meet? you might have even guessed about which group I'm talking about.Well they are also worth $3.6 billion which is equal to the contribution of 26 mid-sized\[1\] companies .

[\[1\] k-pop's band worth.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/k-pops-bts-worth-3-6-billion-south-084730464.html)

And then I realized this....For starters I do agree that they work hard, talented bunch of people, but my main concern is that our youth are getting obsessed over idols rather than getting obsessed over ideals(ethics) which will help everybody improve in their own way(field). It might seem like an ethics lecture for you guys but aren't we making entertainment our obsessions? Which are the least of our concerns when there is so much more going on in this world which needs our attention. I'm not saying entertainment is not important, but these obsessions in the name of entertainment and happiness are going overboard. Moreover media shows all the stuff that they want their audience to see. It's more like quick sand the more you struggle the more you drown, the more audience go crazy the more they show only those stuff to gain popularity, it can be positive or negative only victims know the trouble of surviving it. The way they portray these people(band members) without any flaws wants me doubt even more about them. Don't you think it is too cliche to believe that they don't have any flaws, come on guys! that can't be true they are humans! please let that not be one of the reasons for your obsession. And lastly **I have to appreciate their marketing skills about how to make everything commercial(social media, technology, commercials and variety shows)** it makes you feel like you live with them talk to them in everyday life.That's a disaster you guys now you know why you are obsessed, more than you searching for them they attack you everywhere online this explains international fan base.

I would like to close this story saying don't get obsessed over something that doesn't take you anywhere, try to find some logic behind your obsession, try to find an obsession that makes you successful. Sometimes in order to do this make your feelings listen to your mind.Even though you are successful in whatever you do in everyday life along with the obsession you have over something else, remember it doesn't take you anywhere,find the limit of an obsession to keep it healthy.There are so many ways in which your country should change who knows you might be the one to change whether in positive or negative way is left for you to decide.

**Find a healthy passion rather than a unhealthy obsession**...",0,1,False,self,,,,,

It's hard to show one's passions to others especially if it's something completely different from what others like. Luckily, I had a pretty positive reception. Here's my experience if you're interested---

I'm a male teenager (also Vietnamese) who's a big fan of K-Pop. I dove into the rabbit hole starting with BTS around my sophomore year of high school. I got so into them in fact that I decided to do a dance cover of various BTS songs for the high school variety show (talent show basically). I only danced to certain parts of each song (usually the chorus) and combined them all into one  3 minute dance cover. I did Save Me, Not Today, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, and Dope. Then I got into more K-Pop groups later on and did another dance cover for my junior year. This time with parts of songs from various groups such as Got7 (You Are), MonstaX (Dramarama), Seventeen (Thanks), Vixx (Shangri-La), WannaOne (Energetic), Super Junior (Black Suit), NCT U (Boss), EXO (Power), and BTS (DNA). It made me so happy to see people enjoy the dances, even though they couldn't understand the song XD. Usually for the talent show there's a lot of singers, so being the only dancer made me stand out a bit more from the crowd and even more with the K-Pop music. But my classmates really liked the music and dances, and were a tad bit more interested in K-Pop. Now I'll be doing the dance covers one last time for my senior year and I still haven't decided which songs to choose from this amazing year. ",66,1,False,self,,,,,

I know its been awhile

I dont think...we got the Jukebox out...

*ooooooooooooooooh*

Hello, and welcome back to a feature that's been on a hiatus for awhile but is now back in business! Its been a bit since we last had this feature, but basically to sum it up - these threads serve as a purpose for you (yes, you! You who is reading this) to discuss seven somewhat randomly selected k-pop songs, and what better way to end off the c-r-a-z-y year that was 2018 than with a year-in-review of some of the songs this year? What songs are on Jukebox this week meant to be some of the more highlighted songs from this year? Lets find out! Heres the year-in-review songs:

1. [TWICE - What is Love?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0p1bmr0EmE)
2. [iKON - Love Scenario ( )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vecSVX1QYbQ)
3. [Heize - Jenga (feat. Gaeko)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw_HR9jIJww)
4. [EXO - Tempo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwd8N6K-sLk)
5. [Apink - Im so sick (1 )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4oHuML9U2A)
6. [Seulgi x SinB x Chungha x Soyeon - Wow Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR5CtMLuiqQ)
7. [MV] [J-hope - Daydream ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK3GJ0WIQ8)

Since its been awhile since weve had one of these threads, heres a summary of what to do! These seven songs are up for review, so you get to talk about them and leave any thoughts, be they praise or criticism, about the song! Just remember to keep your comments on the song, not the artists themselves. Alongside your review, please leave a score for the song between 1 and 10, with a score of 1 being the lowest (you REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY ~~BAD BOY~~ didnt like this song) and 10 being the highest (What is Love? This song apparently since you gave it a 10/10!). If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you may leave a review of the MV as well - totally optional and up to you! You can review either one or all seven songs, totally up to you! If you are still a bit confused/unclear as what to do, you can always [refer to the very first Jukebox thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/). 

Typically, I will leave reviews for songs open all week until the upcoming Friday at 11:59 PM PST. Thats not a strict deadline - it just makes it easier for me to calculate scores to reveal in the following Jukebox thread + wiki. Screenshots (and methodology) on how the songs were picked will be in the Other Business comment below.

Basically, what would be your song, album, and artist of the year if it was 100% based on your **personal** preference? (Hell, we know award shows are bias af so why can't we be for once amirite)

Check out last year's thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7ndxzf/your_daesangs_song_album_artist_of_2017/).

Announcing my Daesangs:

**[SONG: Roller Coaster - Kim Chungha]**

Was so close to splitting this category and having one song each for soloist, boy group, and girl group because I had the hardest time deciding between Chungha, **JBJ's 'My Flower'**, and **Red Velvet's 'Bad Boy'** but for me, Roller Coaster was just a tad more amazing than the other two amazing songs

**[ALBUM: 10 Stories - Kim Sung Kyu]**

Again, was going to split this category into three because I really loved Sunggyu's, **Red Velvet's 'The Perfect Red Velvet'**, and **iKON's 'Return'** albums but the soloists had my heart this year. Plus I have a soft-spot for Nell-esque/rock/band type songs and Sunggyu is practically the son of Nell haha

**[ARTIST: TWICE]**

Definitely between TWICE and **BTS** this year but I gave it to TWICE because I really saw them grow and blossom so gracefully this year, really setting themselves apart from the crowd and engraving the TWICE brand into everyone's hearts. (Plus their domination in Japan was no joke.) Not to say BTS didn't grow or dominate, but they have been dominating and probably will continue to lead the K-pop scene for years to come. They're lowkey going to be AOTY in our hearts for a lot of years to come.

By now, I assume you have watched the SBS Gayo stages and saw NCT's. I will help you understand how long it took between each one of Mark's Magic Jacket Changes. 

The notice went up on Saturday and I was encouraged by my friends to just go out for it even though I had work on Monday still. The prerec time wasn't that late at night so it was do-able. Sunday was madness. The allotment was for 1500 fans. We had around that number. However, because it was so many people, it took us a while to get in our lines. List girl moved our check in time up by 30 minutes since there were so many of us and I agreed with her reasoning. That was 11:30 am. Prerec was schedule for 5 pm. 

After I got checked in and froze, I went off to talk to my friends for a bit only to see one of fan support arrive. I then went back to my spot and waited to get checked in again. Staff actually had a few issues because we were suddenly using a fan card from early this year again. It hasn't been seen in a long while. Luckily, they figured it all out and we got our tier ranks and numbers. I ran off to grab food with my friends since we all had no idea when we would be finished. Around 3:00, we got back in line and checked in only for support to tell us that we had until 4:10 as a break time. Spent some more time with my friends just talking as the sun started going down and it started to get even colder.

Finally around 4:30, we started walking over to Sky Dome to wait to enter. As we were walking, I looked back and I mentioned to one of my friends that we look like an army walking to a battle. You know in Lord of the Rings during one of the battles and the camera pans out and you see all the soldiers? That was us only not as soldiers but as fan girls. 

We lined up and waited. Staff gave us balloons and went over the usual rules. We could hear the boys practicing Black on Black and everyone got excited. Around 5:15 or 5:30, we were finally let in. As I was walking in, I turned to my left and I saw Taeyong walking down the stairs to go to the backstage to finish getting ready. We were brought to where we were told to sit and all of us suddenly groaned. 

When we sat down, you could see nothing. We were literally under stage level since the stage was so high. We told staff and asked them to sit down. They did and went ""oh. I see."" The staff member then asked one of the SBS staff if we could stand up. The recording started and we tried to stand up only to be told to sit down. They were filming the intro for the stage and then the intro for Black on Black. Then, the SBS guy became our savior and told us we could stand up. We were super grateful for him and thanked him later on in the prerec.

The order went: 2018 intro, U, Dream, 127, 2018. It usually went around 4-5 takes each mainly to help with the transitions for the stages. For the intro, when they came up in the cages my first thought was Cell Block Tango. I was literally imagining Ten saying ""he ran into my knife."" To indicate who would be performing first, they had these lights flash for each cage and the last one was Taeyong.

We heard part of Boss start and then they stopped the recording. The members who were on the top layer had to get down. It took about 5 minutes before they started Boss. That was when we realized we weren't going to get full songs. After one of the Boss takes, Jungwoo was acting so cute. We were all dying. At the end of Boss, we heard We Go Up start and my section turned to the left and saw the Dreamies standing there. They motioned they were going to be going towards the center stage and that was when my section just lost it. 

The most popular NCT unit here in Korea is NCT Dream. We love the Dreamies and I mean we LOVE THEM. They always get the loudest fanchants, screams, everything from us Seasonies. As they did their recording by us, all of us started jumping up and down and waving while doing the chants. I was three rows from them for 20 seconds and it was glorious. Jisung was so happy seeing so many Seasonies in the audience. When they finished their last take, he gave us a double thumbs up.

Mark had to do a rap verse for Regular before it would transition to Jaehyun. He did that take a few times and then we waited for about 5 or so minutes for Regular to happen on the side right stage. The stage turned around and we saw 127 there wearing those beautiful velvet suits and I swear my heart was all a flutter. So even though with the editing it made it look like each song was done within a 2 minute span, it was more than that. Mark took a while to go over to the stage for Regular. He had to change his pants I believe.

After Regular ended, they announced that they were taking down the stage set for the intro so that they could do Black on Black. Instantly, all of us went on twitter during this 10-15 minute break and started posting what we could. Thankfully, a few fans knew how complicated it was to explain the staging for the intro and the songs, so they created a few diagrams. 

There was no song performed in full yet. So, we all hopped that Black on Black would save us. And save us it did. It was super hard to see the members from where I was. Only a few could stand out. One of them was Kun. He looked like a prince. I was spent. But Ten. Oh lord Ten. The screams for Ten were so loud. A few of my friends are hardcore 10velys (Ten stans) and kept messaging me if his dance solo was cut and what he was wearing. Ten's entire stage presence is beautiful. Of course we naturally messed up the Black on Black fanchants. For some reason, it's just so hard for us. 

A lot of us were super happy they changed the choreo for Black on Black. The last time we saw that performed was Dream Concert and it was super rainy that day. The stage conditions were bad. This time using a rising platform as well as back up dancers (Prepix Crew?), was a great choice and not as risky. The choreo for that song scares all of us in the room so much. Already with Haechan injured, no one wanted another injury. 

After it ended, they were giving us hearts and we were told to just head out. I went to find my friends and all us yelled over how We Go Up deserves better.

The grand total of that entire stage was around 5 minutes if I believe but we were in there for over an hour. It takes a lot of work and time to do these elaborate stages for music shows. I sometimes feel as if the production crews who put this on don't get the credit they deserve. Each week for the music show, they have to build a new set. The SBS Gayo is one of the bigger Gayos of the three. A good portion of the stages are pre-recorded and it's needed because of these sets. 

Side note: Mark Lee might have looked cool taking off the Boss jacket and then putting on the We Go Up jacket, but he had to put the Boss jacket on again to do a take again and he spent a minute trying to figure out which sleeve was the right one. We were awwwing but also laughing at him.

Anyway, that was the SBS Gayo for NCT. It takes a lot of your time waiting to go in and lots of time waiting just for a few minutes of a stage. But for me, it's entirely worth it. ",5,1,False,self,,,,,

In advance, if this post is troublesome, I do apologize.

I am currently a senior in high school taking a class known as ""AP Research."" I am collecting data over a topic of my choosing, which just so happens to be one of my favorite things in the world, K-Pop. Eventually, this collection of data would be written within my research paper. I'm hoping I would be able to get a lot of results from this. 

To explain, it is all objective data to be collected. The purpose of this survey is to confirm the data pattern from the previous Korean Wave (Hallyu). This pattern of specific ethnicities of the active consumers of K-Pop to be of Asian descent. This survey will determine if, by the new changes of the decade, that there has been a shift in the demographics of fans internationally. I'm just looking into the community. 

My survey shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. There is even a provided open-ended section that allows any questions or concerns to get across. Hopefully, you guys could help me out with this! Maybe even share it with other friends and of the sort!
