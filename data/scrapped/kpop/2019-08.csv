I've been hit and miss with K-Pop that entire span, taking sometimes a few year breaks in-between and I DO like a goodly number of newer groups/releases. However, as a past-time after work, I've decided to go back and listen to as many groups/songs from yesteryear as I can. I've found that I...kinda...like it better? Nothing wrong with the newer stuff, I just feel like new gen is all about the flash, colors and pzazz. There is something just...simple and clean about older stuff. Cheesy? Most definitely, but in a refreshing way. Maybe even awkward. As reference, I've been watching live videos of Deux and been quite entertained. They are literally dancing all over the place and tend to almost run into each other every couple seconds. Am I alone in this? Who do you remember watching and/or miss? Any memories? Recommendations?

In the summer before my junior year of college, I had reached my lowest point of depression. SHINee had already had a special place in my heart (my sister showed me Sherlock and my life had never been the same) but I didnt realize how much I needed a positive presence until 2015.

I had a playlist of songs that helped me walk around and feel happy for at least a little while. Your Number by SHINee was one of those songs, and I cant watch the MV without feeling grateful for helping me get through one of the toughest points of my life.

Being in a fandom or liking k-pop can be trivial to one person but so important to the next. I always turn to SHINee whenever I need to relax or reflect. I just need people to know that it can get better, and theres no shame in finding joy in a music group or even just one song. One little thing can improve your life, and I hope k-pop can help you all feel a little happier, because thats what it did to me. ",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Girls have it harder in kpop.

They have to be skinny, tall, perfect visuals, and very cute or sexy. Meanwhile, boys don't even have it half as bad.


Korean fans are worse than international fans.

It seems like Korean fans hate on idols for *everything*. From dating or for being fucking human, they have to make a big stink for everything.


Girl Crush / dark concepts are becoming*too* overdone.

As much as I love Girl crush, it seems now every group is doing it. It just feels so forced now.


Allkpop and other kpop news sites are Bullshitters who claim to hate fanwars all while create them for clout / clicks.


Music award shows have become too predictable.

For example, twice always gets SOTY, and BTS always wins whatever they are nominated for. It Also feels that ROTY seems to be predictable from debut. (Example, ITZY)


Streaming on YouTube is stupid and pointless.

Unless it's a world record for most viewed 24 hour video or most viewed MV, streaming gets you nothing. I always see people in commenting saying ""StrEaM ThIs"" or ""(fandom name here) SuPpORtinG (fandom name or group here)"". Like who TF cares where you come from like bitch just watch the video and goooooooo.

 i've been actively listening to k-pop since the beginning of 2016. i quickly fell in love with the feel of genuine thankfulness i could feel from every song. it gave me goosebumps and i loved it. the concept didn't really matter, the feel was always there. genuine but still classy.

 i honestly think music now isn't genuine nor classy. it feels blank to me most of the time. i feel like maybe it's because most of the idols right now are singers because it's kind of a trend now in korea to try and be one. most of the idols say ""i'm an idol because i saw bts performing at bbmas and i thought i want it too"" when asked why they bacame idols and i h-a-t-e this answer. i would love to be on bbmas' stage too, but i don't have the talent, the charisma nor the determination for this. (just an example) yes, these groups work hard but i really think every second idol right now doesn't now what to do so they decide to become ""singers"" with minimum to no actual talent. now it feels like if people in korea don't know what to do they just become idols. 

of course there are some exceptions like loona, dreamcatcher, nct and etc. (for me personally at least) but still, those groups are the smaller percent...

Do you think it is inappropriate for non-native Koreans to write music using the Korean language? Some have said it is appropriation, some have said that native Koreans are happy so long as their culture is spread elsewhere.  


Personally, I would hope that it is not, as I am learning the language and have always found its syllabic structure to work well with modern EDM.

Ive been wanting to audition to become a kpop idol for a while now, however, my parents are extremely against the idea.

Ive been told by many people I look very much like an idol, and Im 6 feet. I havent gotten any formal singing lessons, but I have an ear for pitch and harmonizing ( my singing is quite raw and not very good) and Ive never danced before except when I used to figure skate as a younger lad. Im completely aware of the difficulties of trainee life, but my heart
is completely set on doing this. Please, if you can, let me know as to how to convince my parents. Whenever I even bring up the idea I end up getting in trouble/ sent to my room to study and its quite annoying.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

Several Chinese K-pop idols and their affiliations had been severely affected by this, namely Lay, Jackson, Victoria, UNIQ, WayV-NCT, and many others. I feel like this was also the reason why agencies started to stir their artists towards Japanese market and (coincidentally also propelled by BTS' success) western/US market more.

Now I'm just wondering, if the hallyu ban never took place, i.e companies are still able to freely promote their groups in China, more collaborating projects with China's talents, etc, how do you think the K-pop industry would have had pan out now? In a parallel universe where THAAD dispute never happens and hallyu ban is non-existent, what would have happened to K-pop from 2016 until now?",41,88,False,self,,,,,

King Harald and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cln6oo/watching_monsta_x_at_a_private_concert_with_he/,NishinosanTV,1564862807,"Hi, I'm Sander, you might know me as one of the moderators here. 

When I'm not moderating Im usually working with Omona in Norway, we host various K-pop events like cons, dance workshops and event organizing. I'll try and get you my perspective on this event called Voyage to K-pop which was organized by the Korean Embassy in Norway.

My job, with Omona, was to promote Voyage to K-pop to both Norwegian and International fans.

""Voyage to K-pop"" was a concert that took place on the 11th of June in Oslo, Norway, as well as the *secret* concert that was held on the 12th of June.

The first section of this fan account will hop a little back and forth, but Im trying to show you my perspective on how things unfolded for me.

# Something's going to happen?

This all started back in April 2019, where we got a message from The Republic of Korea's Embassy in Norway. They said they wanted to invite us (Omona) for dinner where they wanted to discuss K-pop and culture in Norway. We didn't know what we had in store.

A few days before the dinner, our head chief at Omona had received a message from a Korean organizer (X) about a possible concert in Norway, and we were told to hold off a certain date. We were eagerly expecting to talk about this concert which was going to happen in Oslo, as the Ambassador would know about this?  
Weve previously eaten with the THEN Ambassador back in 2017 at the Korean Embassy in Norway. We were now invited to a great Korean restaurant in Oslo. [During the dinner](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxiURhRIwaE/?igshid=1wcpoz9v6bo6u) the embassy discussed the milestone which is the 60th anniversary of Norway-Korea diplomatic relations. They didn't specifically mention a concert, but we wanted to commemorate this historic milestone with something special, yet they didnt specifically mention what they wanted to do.

Early May we received a message from X that a free concert is taking place in Oslo - the artists are Monsta X, Momoland and Hyolyn. Omona's role with this event was promotion. We were also later informed by the Embassy that this X is one of the main organizers of the concert, but however, due to confidentiality, I am not able to say persons name. So- it was confirmed that there was a concert. However, we couldn't announce the concert just yet due to timing for artists and the Korean government had to have everything put into place. But we in Omona felt the need to make some official statement in public that ""something"" was happening, so that people could prepare to travel to Oslo on a short notice. In our closed Facebook group for Norwegian fans (Kpop Norge) we said: ""Hold off the 11th of June, something big is coming to Oslo""

Now since we are known for hosting Omona annually people immediately caught on and knew **something massive** was going to happen, so they started speculating artists. Some didn't think this *thing* would involve artists, so some people speculated that this would be an announcement for Omona tickets or some form of dance workshop.

Announcement of the concert came on the 21st of May, it was to be held at Sentrum Scene in Oslo which houses 1700 people. People didn't believe us when we announced the event, because the artist pages and schedule had no info about it. We had to tell them that we are the ones that are announcing it - but alas, people were sceptical. The tickets dropped on the 23rd of May and sold out in under 2 minutes. About 1700 tickets were sold out in record time. Many Norwegian fans received tickets and a whole bunch of international fans got tickets.

Our boss also said that we had to hold off the 12th as there was something going on in the Royal Opera. Two weeks before the concert we found out that President Moon Jae In and Madame First Lady were to come to Norway for a state visit and that they also would attend that something happening in the Royal Opera. We now knew what was going to happen. Monsta X were personally asked by President Moon Jae In to perform in the Royal Opera. My King, H.M. Harald V and Crown Prince Haakon was also set to attend this concert. This was kept a secret for the public until a few days before the concert in the Opera.

Sadly, towards the buildup to the concert on the 11th, Hyolyn had to cancel her appearance. In her stead we got Giant Pink (Unpretty Rapstar) and Jang Jane (SM Ent) to join the concert.

Our chief was in discussion with the organizer of the event. The organizers wanted a Random Dance Play outside the venue before the concert began as there was going to be some media coverage. We started working out who in the Omona crew would be responsible for the event, when luckily a dance group did a post on the event page saying that they would host one for free. 

We got in touch with them and they gladly approved to participate. This had to be scheduled right before the opening of the doors to get into the concert, as there was going to be Korean media as well as Norwegian press that was going to cover the concert as well as the RDP. A recap of this RDP and concert was to be shown the next day in front of the President and the King.

Now- the fun begins.

# Day 1 (190611) : ""Voyage to K-pop""

Day 1 of the biggest K-pop concert in Norway, ever. It felt weird taking the train into Oslo that day, as weve never had something SO big K-pop related happening in Oslo. 

We met up early outside the concert venue and started sharing some already made cutouts of Instagram frames which we wanted attendees to take pictures with so we could promote the event on social media. You can explore the [Voyage to Kpop](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/voyagetokpop/) \# on Instagram to see some photos.

Queue started very early, so we took the trip around and greeted the fans, we also met up with X who was very happy to see the Norwegian fans outside the venue. Some fans started doing Random Dance Plays before the real scheduled one and other fans joined in and had fun. The queuing was just smiles, which was very fortunate. 

Skipping forward, and the RDP started, Korean media were covering the event, our dear X was also there filming the dance. Everything recorded here by them was to be used during the performance the next day. The filming went fine, and the line was ready to enter the doors for the venue. Right before the doors opened X came to us and escorted us through the back entrance. We travelled from the back entrance to the inside part of the front entrance where the attendees walk in. We were handing out lightsticks, pre-bought by the Korean Embassy, which was to be given to every attendee. We helped there until everyone was inside and after that we went to the top floor and got ready for the concert.

First out was the Ambassador herself, she gave a speech commemorating our long friendship and was happy with the turn up of the event. We ended up doing a fanchant for the Ambassador too. She announced the first artist- Giant Pink. 

Giant Pink began her segment of the concert with a song that started slow but then had a massive bass drop in the middle of it. The cheer the room had when that bass hit was unreal. We added some new fanchants along the way just for Giant Pink and she felt incredibly touched by this. Jang Jane was also incredible, she ended up jumping down the stage to some of the fans during one of her songs to greet them. After that both artists shared a duet from a drama OST and were interviewed. During the interview they also learned how to say I Love You in Norwegian; Jeg Elsker Deg. 

Next up- Momoland. [Here's my fancam of their opening.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IiaGzBDWUQ) The FANCHANT during this song, was out of this world. I HIGHLY recommend you watching that fancam above, I cant describe it in words how amazing both the fans and their performance was. Heres also a link to Momoland also learning how to say [I love you in Norwegian](https://aminoapps.com/c/momoland1/page/blog/jeg-elsker-deg/D8kr_2Z6hPumRlPrqJgvz2WEQLMdJvQJ0V1)

Now Monsta X Norwegian K-pop fans has a majority of girl fans, so naturally, Norway loves boy groups more. I cant even begin to describe how loud the venue was when Monsta X started walking out. [Heres a fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0ZdiOL824c). To also comment on their dancing - they dont fuck around, Monsta X has some of the craziest choreographies Ive seen in K-pop. If you ever get a chance to see them near you, go for it. 

After Monsta X had finished performing the concert ended. Me and the rest of Omona met up outside, baffled, amazed and totally speechless. We had just witnessed, and help organize, the biggest K-pop concert ever in Norway.

But Its not over...

# DAY 2 (190612) : ""Voyage To Korea | Royal Opera""

Our crew were specifically asked to come to this concert as we were promoters for the concert yesterday. Other notable people attending excluding royal people were high-class citizens who had previously worked with / in Korea, Ambassadors, music writers for K-pop (Notable- Dsign Music) and various entertainers.

We were required to arrive early to the Royal Opera as we had to be personally frisked by many police officers so we didnt bring anything illegal. If there was one place in Oslo where you would feel safe on that day, there was going to be no other place than the Royal Opera. We are talking about a good amount of civil and uniformed guards patrolling both outside and inside the venue, armed and unarmed. And thats just the Norwegian guard, the President himself also had a bunch of guards as well who were patrolling the venue. 

We had to wait indoors near the reception before we were allowed to get to our seats. X came to us and told us we were going to sit on the first row inside. X also needed some assistance with tickets and queuing of the other guests attending, so I was asked to help out here along with my boss in Omona, the rest of Omona were free to enter the venue without us, and we would enter later. I received my access card from X which also gave me access to most of the venue.

We finished queuing the other guests, got in and sat down on the first row. We were informed right before the King and President walked in that we had to stand up and look at them when they were walking in. An announcer came out on stage and said Please rise for President Moon Jae In, and King Harald V And there they came This was naturally my first time seeing President Moon and Madame First Lady, but it was also my first time seeing my King and the Crown Prince too. We clapped as they walked in, President Moon and Madame First Lady was smiling as they walked in. 

We had to remain standing until they sat down at their seats. Some people snagged some pictures, but normal etiquette says that you should not do this. They sat down - we sat down. The foreign Minister of Korea came out and did a speech commemorating Norway and Koreas deep friendship and thanked Norway for our generosity during the Korean War. 

Next up was Monsta X. Now, I have to say again, I was front row- I was literally 1 meter away from being able to touch their feet. They performed Alligator first, I've seen some photos online where the President and King is smiling and clapping along to the song. It seems that this concert was a hit for both of them. I also was able to [snag a pic](https://www.instagram.com/p/BynxjqxiuGs/) while they did they speech in between Alligator and the next song - Dramarama. Both songs were amazing, the boys did really well. We got eye contact loads of times and we even did some fanchants, which surprised some of the boys and they smiled back at us! Also, Wonho has some massive thighs, what the hell. 

Jang Jane and Giant Pink also came to this concert. Jane did a cover of a famous Norwegian song, which was also written by a woman attending the concert, which shocked Jane. She was extremely grateful for having the opportunity to perform in front of the President and the King. Jane and Giant Pink also did their OST duet together. 

Next up was a very famous Norwegian soloist called Sissel Kyrkjeb. She's a very high regarded soprano who has created many all time classics in Norway (Some of you might know her from the Titanic OST). She also tried her hand at speaking hangul, which was met with applause from the Koreans who attended the concert. 

We had some Korean traditional music - ""Binari"" performed by Kim Yulhee as well as the amazing pianist Jung Jaeil who also did an amazing final segment of the concert. 

When Jaeil finished finished we stood up and the President and King left the room with their service folks. When they left some others also started walking out too, when a woman working for the Ambassador in Norway came up on stage and spoke in Korean. Sadly I don't understand any Korean (yet) but what she said made some of the Koreans gasp and made them start moving quicker out of the concert hall. I went to the one in Omona who speaks Korean, she told us that, if we are quick, we are able to greet the President. 

Naturally, we wanted to do this. We went out and a line was already forming, we went to the end of the line and we eventually heard gasps. The President was taking the rounds and greeting everyone. Slowly and steadily he was coming closer, shaking hands with everyone.

Now, one thing you gotta know with Norwegians, we really like a firm handshake. So, when the President came to handshake me, I grabbed and pressed his hand really hard, expecting him to do the same, but no, he had this soft handshake where he only holds with a few of his fingers instead of the whole hand. Really awkward, but he kept smiling, which I did too. I snagged a [picture right before we shook hands](https://www.instagram.com/p/BynxjqxiuGs/) (swipe), but I sadly have no picture of us shaking hands.

After the handshaking session the rest of the Omona crew decided they wanted to eat somewhere. We went to the local Friday's and sat down there and ate some burgers. While we were getting the food we saw some Koreans arrive into Fridays as well. We noticed from earlier that it was some of Monsta X's managers. We also noticed that one member from Monsta X was there too, notably the Starbucks Sipping Meme King - Hyungwon. He sat down at the table next to us and also ordered the same burger as me.  We didn't really engage in talks with him, we respected their privacy. But when he left with his managers right before we left he ended up bowing towards us, we bowed back, so he was aware of who we were.

# Aftermath

So, you might be wondering why I'm posting this now and not in June. 

A combination of a few things here, I finished my bachelors in December where I got a really good grade on my final paper, and Red Velvet was also touring North America. I'm a big fan of Red Velvet so I figured I'd celebrate myself with a trip to New York to see them live there. I got myself some tickets and travelled from Norway to New York and met up with some cool people who I met online through r/red_velvet.

Now, how's that relevant? Well, you see, ""X"" knew that I took the trip to New York to see them live, and that I was a big fan. ""X"" pulled a few strings, and I received a gift today, as a thank you for my hard work during the Voyage To K-pop concert.

Everyone... [Promotional ""RBB"" album personally signed by every member of Red Velvet](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0s4ps8i1ig/). This is super hard to get, and I'm really grateful and humbled. I can't thank ""X"" enough.

\- - -

Thank you all for reading! If you've got any questions I'm able to answer some, the fan account might be a little bit over the place, so if there's something that you find off here, don't hesitate to ask. However, everything related to ""X"" can't be answered, that's confidential. 

If you want to, I'm on Instagram, and I'm moving to Korea in a few weeks to study Hangul for a year. If you want to follow my trip, I'd be really happy if you [followed me](https://www.instagram.com/sanderbraekke/) on Instagram!",21,255,False,self,,,,,

And which do you think werent such a good option?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/clvcp9/what_kpop_group_names_do_you_think_were_the_best/,revluvly,1564918352,"I personally think names that are common with other casual things in the world or are popularized for other things are a bad option, because when you go to search it they arent the first that pop up unless the group becomes very popular. And sometimes even if the group is popular if something else with their name is more popular, then the group wont come up without typing Kpop next to it. For example Big Bang is super popular but they arent the first ones that pop up, Big Bang Theory will come up on google first. BTS was quite a headache at first because of the acronym and now they have become so famous u assume u r talking abt them when u use Behind The Scene. 

I dont Like difficult to type names like Gidle, its so unnecessary with the parenthesis and hyphen, u have to even remove that when hashtagging which is pointless naming them that. Also do not like abbreviations for GWSN and WJSN, I always mix it up and they arent the easiest alphabet put together to roll off your tongue if u get what I mean. First time I saw the name BlackPink I thought it was weird two colors together and its gonna be awkward but now its so iconic to me and their logo is pretty. 

I love quirky names like Weki Meki, its cute. Pristin was a good name too imo. I like Nuest and Orange Caramel. EXO is a good name also because of all the words you can combine with EXO, they have been very clever about it so far. Let me know Group names you thought were a great option and ones u thought were What were they thinking? ",249,129,False,self,,,,,

Now, don't get me wrong I have nothing against boy groups. My bias group is Shinee, but they are the only boy group that I can say I genuinely enjoy and follow.

There are boy group songs that I like alot including Beast and highlight old stuff like 'gotta go to work' or Wanna Ones 'energetic'  and some Vixx releases like dynomite. 

Needless to say I like fun, cute, light-hearted songs. I really like bright concepts or concepts that have to do with space. I also enjoy boyfriend concepts quite a bit. The stranger the concept and song, the better honestly. I really dislike hard concepts, or heavy rap concepts.

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ciz91a/nugu_roundup_4_i_am_groo_190728/). I had thought Pink Fantasy's comeback was scheduled before this week, but I suppose it's not, so we're going to go with another group as the big focus this week who recently had a comeback - Busters!  I'm also continuing the little snippet of groups that were gone too soon.  Have any suggestions for others that should be featured?  Let me know!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

 

**And now onto the show...**

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**Busters**

**Who are they?:**  Busters is a five member girl group created by Monstergram and co-managed with JTG Entertainment.  Created initially to promote an anime called 'Idol Ranger Power Busters' (though I can't seem to find any episodes or clips online, [here's the Power Busters Website](http://powerbusters.co.kr/)).

**Company:** Monstergram is an entertainment company involved in CF production, game soundtracks, OSTs, and animation.  JTG Entertainment is a Kpop company who's only current group is Berry Good, co-manages Busters with Monstergram, and is apparently working on a new boy group.

**Genre:** Cute Crush

**Vlogs:** [Busters YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtcx-hTMn16oAlUMzIncb1g/videos) (via Marbling).

**Trivia:**  Busters is one of the youngest Kpop idol groups (outside of specifically child groups).  Members Chaeyeon and Yeseo (as well as former member Minjung) were in the child idol group CutieL.  Super Junior's Shindong directed the MVs for Dream On and Lalala as well as the choreography video for Grapes.  Busters members used their own money to make box lunches for fans for a special fan meet event at the 2018 ISAC event, but only 11 fans showed, 5 of the no-shows were apparently actually fans of more well-known group and pretended to be Busters fans to skip the longer line.  Busters has toured in Brazil, and they have a rather large number of commenters on their videos in Portuguese and Spanish.

**D1CE**

**Who Are They:** A five member boy group under Happyface Entertainment/D1CE Company, Dreamcatcher's Brother group. 

**Genre:** R&amp;B/Hip-Hop/EDM

**MVs:** Wake Up ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj8mND7Q16Y))

**KProfiles:** [Info Link](https://kprofiles.com/d1ce-profile-facts/)

**Variety:** None Yet

**Vlogs:** [D1CE Day via the D1CE YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-oSDMufaaGNeQbNoLMU1ZQ/videos)

**Trivia:**  Apparently pronounced 'D-Once' despite looking like 'Dice' and having actual dice featured heavily in their debut MV.  Debuted a few days ago.  HappyFace set up a new sub-company called D1CE Company to promote the group similar to how they set up Dreamcatcher Company to promote Dreamcatcher.

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**High School**

**Who Are They:** A four member girl group under Richworld Entertainment

**Genre:** Sexy/EDM/Hip-Hop

**MVs:** High Class ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQHC1oRu3E)) Baby You're Mine ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVq79sKJVd4))

**KProfiles:** [Info Link](https://kprofiles.com/high-school-profile-facts/)

**Vlogs:** [High School Vlogs via Richworld Entertainment Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Richworldmusic/videos)

**Random stuff:** [Baby You're Mine Dance Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovnAfTE1xb8), [Baby You're Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bNaVrGHf1g) live on Simply Kpop.

**Trivia:** There's some confusion about whether this group has officially debuted or not - some sources are telling me they have and Baby You're Mine is their first official release, others are saying that both releases are pre-debut singles.  The girls have been wearing masks in all activities and performances thus far, with the apparent logic that their CEO wanted people to focus on their talents rather than their visuals (which seems odd in the context of some of their wardrobe choices)

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**BIBI**

**Who Is She:** A female soloist under FeelGhood Music.  Sometimes also credited as 'Naked Bibi'

**Genre:** R&amp;B/Soloist

**MVs:** Binu ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z9sq9e5iu4)), [Nabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3uzROnFGnA) (MV)

**Trivia:** Her first EP '[The Manual for People who want to Fall in Love](https://www.amazon.com/Manual-people-want-love-Explicit/dp/B07T97WPD7)' received praise from industry powerhouses Hyuna and Twice's Chaeyoung.  She speaks English, Korean, and Spanish.

**Special Feathre - In Memorium:**

**D.Holic**

**Who Were They:** A four (at one point five) member girl group from Star Road Entertainment

**Genre:** Sexy/Girl-Crush/EDM

**MVs:** 

* I Don't Know ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVp4_5pNARg))  This was their Debut MV
*  Without You ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsgSeyrSR0o)) A big change in style, much more innocent, a very pretty ballad
* Chewy ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-a8lPAphSE)) Back to the sex-appeal, complete with a rather suggestive liquid candy facial scene
* Murphy and Sally ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmUHSlRAWpk)) A more straightforward Girl Crush concept with some Minx-ish sass
* Color Me Rad ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAp6zeE2bMA)) My favorite of all of their songs, a sexy, sports, bad-ass, hard dance track.  Despite this being obviously low-budget compared to some of their previous releases, they sell it incredibly well.  

**KProfiles:** [Info Link](https://kprofiles.com/d-holic-members-profile/)

**Variety:** D.Holic [Rookie Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_c90fPq9u8) interview.

**Vlogs:** [D.Holic YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/tgplay2405/videos)

**Random stuff:** [Chewy Dance Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcaamKEmJjY), [Murphy and Sally Dance Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyK4_AaAUZM), [Let's Go To the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3iSHlDOTk) live at KDrama Fest,

**Active Between:** August 23, 2014 and July 2017

**Reason for Disbanding:** Rapid membership changes towards the end for reasons varying from health to wanting to pursue different career paths culminating in all but one member leaving the company, forcing a disbandment.

**Trivia:** The group is multi-ethnic with Korean, Chinese, and Japanese members.  Over time nine different girls were part of the group.  Member EJ, who joined near the end and always wore a mask to conceal her face is now pursuing a modeling career.  Member Hwajung debuted this year as a solo artist ([Solo Debut 'Heart' MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goNuh1Pib5s)). Original member Rena is rumored to be slated for Star Road Entertainment's next girl group.  Her last release I can find is a solo OST release for something that Google Translates to 'Flower Bloody Sunflower' with a song called [Do Not Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gq-RIgbE68).

If you're an /r/kpop veteran you might remember a series I did years ago where I shared songs that weren't posted on reddit previously that I believed were worth listening to. Turns out, it was incredibly time consuming, and once school started up again I simply couldn't keep up with the posts without sacrificing any hobby I had outside finding and digesting obscure Korean music.

Well, flash forward to now and I'm working a stable job where multitasking and listening to absurd amounts of music is a much more feasible endeavor for me to do regularly, and thus I decided to bring this back! Many songs I had discovered back then had remained some of my favorites to this day (shout out to [Rec by Farlaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk6dkryNqxM))

With all that said, the ground rules:

* Any song posted here will not be off an album posted on reddit, even if it had just 3 upvotes (shoutout to nugutown)
* The genre tagging is a mixture of what's officially listed, and my opinion. I'm no ethnomusicologist so forgive mis-tagging.
* Songs are listed in alphabetical order by artist

I hope you all enjoy this as much as I do! I listened to over 200 songs this week, for at least 3 hours each week day, and narrowed down a tight little playlist for you all.

Last week we had artists like BTS, ONF, Ben, and more that had songs on last week. Our highest rated song was **GFriend's Time For the Moon Night** with an overall score of **8.92**  congrats to GFriend!

This week's songs were chosen for ""sounding 90's"", ""sounding early 2000's"", or literally being products of their time! We might be 2000 and LATE I got you under my skin cuz we still talkin' and walkin'. Do you got that Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom? Are you not just hot, but SO Hot? What are you up to today? Ready to feel the heat? Or are you feeling more icy this week? Here's the songs for this week!

1. [MV] [Girls Generation - The Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pA_Tou-DPI)
2. [Wonder Girls - So Hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmun5PO54VE)
3. [ITZY - Icy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndvqTc4P9I)
4. [EXID - I Love You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAdmzjsFVQo)

7. [TVXQ - Mirotic ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJS32n6LNQ)

Want to participate in this week's Jukebox? Here's a quick guide! Each week you get the chance to review seven songs on Jukebox. Listen to the song(s) you want to review and then leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song(s) in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song is a big ""Uh oh!"" for you, and 10 being this song is SO HOT, it's got that BOOM! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can also use the MV to inform your overall score  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

You can keep reviewing songs until this Saturday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your reviews and comments in by then!

The video was similar to ""sound cloud"" rappers of the current era. If i remember correctly he has glass, kinda nerdy vibe, potentially had backpack in every video -- not sure about that last one. 

I think most information for you all, as fans, would be that my friend told me he is actually in a group but has started putting out solo music because he out shined them.

I used to (still do) use AirPods for listening to music both in the house and outside the house, just because they are small and don't feel as awkward as headphones. 

I want to use separate headphones when I am at home or traveling long distances, because from what I've seen, the AirPods quality is kinda bad, and you can't wear them comfortably when laying down in bed and whatnot.

Now there are many theories saying that she will end her contract with JYPE (which should be the LAST thing that ever happens).

I feel like Mina is going to take a long time to recover from her anxiety (probably until March 2020). But until then, I just hope that she takes a long break from TWICE and refrains from any activities that might worsen her condition.

Some people are talking about how this means Mina is leaving TWICE; no. Hiatus and departure are two different things. I want her to take a hiatus for the sake of her health, not leave TWICE (because that will literally be one of the worst things ever).

For example, 2NE1 basically starting the girl crush trend, APink and others bringing more girly concepts back into the spotlight, etc. Especially with the specific types of production that is used for many groups, a lot of groups remind me of other ones in the past or even now. 

For example, Seventeen using a lot of EDM in their titles reminds me a lot of many of KARA's title tracks back in the day, like Step and Mr. I don't know if this is a good comparison, but Taemin's solo work reminds me a lot of Rain's Rainism (and of course Michael Jackson). I know this has been mentioned before, but I felt it so much when reading that some people thought Superhuman by NCT127 was a SHINee-esque song (though of course it's the classic SM sound). ITZY is also reminding me a lot of Red Velvet's Red side while being very different, with unapologetically energetic title tracks so far.

While I love both ""Signal"" and ""Rookie"" (the songs) you can't deny how polarizing they were. Not only were they both polarizing they were THE most polarizing title tracks from both respective groups (at least I think so) and had really big hate trains behind them (""Signal"" has much less views than ""What Is Love?"", ""Likey"" and ""Heart Shaker"", songs that were released after it). Both of the mini albums however are literally legendary. The only song I don't like from ""Signal"" is ""Only You"", the rest are legendary meanwhile ""Rookie"" is flawless from start to finish.

Another title track I wasn't too keen on is ""Ride on the Wind"" by KARD. I love the verses, I love the prechorus but the instrumental chorus is just awful. I forced myself to like it but if I'm being objective, it's horrible, loud and grating. The album on the other hand is absolutely flawless, the 3 other songs have been some of my most played songs since release.

""EVERYD4Y"" by WINNER is an AMAZING album but I didn't really like the title track at first. It's grown on me quite a bit these days but I still can't over the fact that it's a flex song. Flex songs in general are just hella cringy.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. Good luck!

 P.S: I finished my 4th video on [I.O.I](https://youtu.be/WYualQj2YDA). Still needs more work, but i'm getting better! = D",7,21,False,self,,,,,

It comes across as biased when you apparently are ""levelling the playing field"" ( I say this with great skepticism). Would you rather fans of popular groups just not post here at all? 

The way you regulate content is heavily based on whether a group is successful enough to have had stuff posted many times. We don't care for it. Thus, do you want us to just not submit content here if its about these select groups you heavily moderate?

What NCT should do,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cmxokf/sm_sucks_what_nct_should_do/,imma-dragon-rawr,1565132841,"Hello, lately I have been very frustrated with SM's management of NCT. And I know there's a lot of other people who are also frustrated. So I am going to use reddit to rant about what SM should do with NCT at the group's current situation.

First, let me say I do not hate their ""limitless"" concept. I think it could work, IF SM knew what they were doing, which they obviously don't. Because of this, SM should just stop. NCT should not add any more members. It should stay as a 21 membered group. I've always thought the graduation system in Dream would fail, and it looks like I was right, but I'll talk about that later.

Make NCT a set group with 21, but also make 127, Dream, and WayV set too. Four out of the six dreamies are graduating soon, and we still haven't seen the new rookies. WHERE ARE THEY SM!? What's gonna happen to the graduated members? Haechan still has 127, and there's a chance Renjun could go to WayV, but what about Jaemin and Jeno? 127 is already a set unit so they can't go there! Are the new dreamies gonna have to due more mature concepts with their baby faces? Or are Chenle and Jisung going back to ""Chewing Gum"" like songs? Or is Dream just gonna be Chensung? WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING SM!? JUST MAKE DREAM A SET UNIT!!!

So NCT officially has 21 members and will not add any more. 127, Dream, and WayV will also not have any member changes. SM kicked Winwin out of 127 and didn't say anything about it. So what I am thinking, is that SM should come out and say Winwin is officially only promoting with WayV and not apart of 127. The same should also be said about Haechan, him only being in 127, to avoid a Dream-doesn't-have-a-comeback-for-ten-months situation, and so Haechan won't overwork himself.

This will leave each member to be apart of one set unit. 9 members in 127, 5 in Dream, and 7 in WayV. NCT U can be the unit to mix-and-match members. This could lead to some fun and interesting combinations and concepts. No offense to the members, but I'm highkey getting tired of the same four same people.

This is just my opinion. I highly doubt SM will ever do this. I don't even know how realistic it would be with ""WayV not being apart of NCT"" and such. This might be a little biased because I stan ot21 and was dreading when SM was going to add new members, but would accept it and grow to like the new members. But now I think SM has no idea what they're doing. 

TL;DR: SM sucks at managing NCT and should stop adding new members",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I think everyone should be warned to change their passwords if they used the same one as on allkpop. 

If you have an account on allkpop, you should reset your password. If you have purchased something from their store, be careful and watch out for anything. 

It's unethical for them NOT to disclose that they have been hacked. 

We cannot trust the hacker when they say 'NO ACCOUNTS WERE STOLEN'. What if someone else hacked allkpop prior to this? The vulnerability was there. They MUST DISCLOSE. 

Just a heads up to this community.

My girlfriend tho, shes Army, like crazy about BTS !! And this is where I need your help !

Her birthday is coming and, even if I have already bought something to her, I would like, her classmates, her sisters and I to offer her a gift related to BTS.

The problem is : I dont really know much about them, although I watch some videos of them sometimes, I cannot say I am Army.

Do you have any idea of what gift a BTS fan would really appreciate ?

For instance, it seems the Big 3 are at a critical junction. SME's unpredictable promotions and moves along with the issues surrounding LSM has brought them a lot of negative attention. YG is consistently under fire from scandals while dealing with the recent transfer of power to the new CEO, the postponement of Treasure13, uncertainty over iKon, new solo debuts, Blackpink's advancement, etc. JYP seems to be getting more and more successful with Stray Kids and Day6 gaining more success, Twice still extremely successful, GOT7 doing well, whatever they are planning with Boy Story and the other Chinese boy group, and the preparation for the Japanese girl group underway.

Beyond them, other companies are also experiencing their ups and downs: Big Hit has recently acquired Source Music, RBW is branching out into Vietnam with a boy group debut, the Produce series are most likely continuing, and several companies are going to have post-IZ*ONE and post-X1 groups within the next few years, some with both, and more groups are starting to attempt advancing into the US.

Suzy blew up unexpectedly in 2012 with Intro to Architecture (after getting a huge head start from miss A's successful smash debut in 2010 and then hit drama Dream High in 2011).

Third generation has spawned it girls - Irene, Jennie, Hwasa, etc. But no one that blew up and became national level the way Suzy did. Twice has some extremely popular girls as well but because JYP focuses on group rather than solo promotions I don't think any of them made it to Suzy level either. 

So now we have new rookies: IZONE, ITZY, Everglow, Rocketpunch, etc.

So my question to you guys is: who do you think has that potential to blow up and become The Next Suzy and all the national level fame that entails? Or are companies too focused on group promotions these days that it would make the rise of a new it girl of that magnitude impossible?",52,5,False,self,,,,,

Is Bts a virus in the Kpop industry or the industry was made to collapse the way it is right now? 
Was the foundation of Kpop this weak? 
For example Sm was used to this fan transfer system. The majority of their older groups fandom will most of the time will move to the next group. Some may disagree with this, but its a thing I noticed especially during exo early days. Like I was saying this transfer happen for years now, but for some reason it didnt work when NCT debuted. Some may argue that it was because of BTS while other think that SM technique of killing their older groups to promote the new ones was meant to fail.

WayV/NCT, EXO, and Taemins solos are doing just fine. However, I think seeing a mashup of members of these groups together will be a breath of fresh air while SHINee and EXO members are enlisting. 

While it may have been a better idea to let the artists from the groups undergoing enlistment start their own solo pursuits, I think SM going to new heights isnt such a bad idea.

WayV and NCT will get more promotion, and so will EXO and SHINee. If they are to have a US debut, Im sure it will catch the eyes of Americans and strengthen their original groups popularities in the states.

I feel like some people are lying to themselves. Who wouldnt be excited to see all these members performing together on stage? With their stage presence and talent, it sounds amazing.

However, I do think that it may be a bad idea in some way for NCT/WayV, as they are very actively promoting and this could take the members away from their original group. Im also concerned about NCT members especially being overworked.

Though, perhaps it isnt all doom and gloom. This could be a really good idea. Its workable.

I do not believe this is due to lack of resources as there are plenty of ways to learn and Ive seen many a guide passed around online and in person. And while fanchants do take some time to learn, I believe learning the choreography is just as difficult and Im sure there are more people who know how to dance to a song than those who know the fanchant for it.

So why do you think this part of the kpop fandom never really took off with international fans? Is it simply a difference of culture? 

Also, for those of you who have participated or will participate in kpop concerts, how do you feel about fanchants? Do you personally learn them and do them? Why or why not? Do you think there are reasons why people shouldnt do them?",56,0,False,self,,,,,

At that exact same time, Sunny Side Up was playing on my Spotify so I decided to mute the Crush MV (Sunny Side Up is a bop okay?)

However, I made a shocking discovery when i realised that the song and the MV that I was playing on YouTube started to sync up almost perfectly. They matched each other so well that the choreo parts of the Crush MV almost made it seem as if Weki Meki were dancing to SSU. 

So I was wondering if there are any other kpop songs and MVs that possess a similar effect to Crush/Sunny Side Up. Thank you so much.",1,3,False,self,,,,,

**Which fandom is the most toxic?**

The top comment was K-Pop.

As a fan for over 10 years, I'd say I am not surprised. I hate saying this as well, but this sub really shows that.

Anything you say that doesn't align with someone's interest or opinion is immediately downvoted to hell, like a swarm of bees just attacking one comment. There was one comment I saw that had around -50 downvotes, so I had to click to see what it said. I was expecting some harsh words, or anything involving sexism, racism, etc. But it was simply ""Curtai-phobia"". The comment was on the thread where Heechul said he closes his curtains for privacy. Like, where is the offensive part of that one word? That he's scared of curtains, as a joke? Makes absolutely no sense.

If you continue reading that thread about toxic fandom, a lot of the comments deal with BTS. I've seen countless comments on YouTube, Instagram, and on here where BTS fans will attack others for no reason.

One innocent commenter would say ""I do not support Seungri, but I still like Big Bang's music!"", and you would instantly get a hoard of BTS fans saying unnecessary stuff like ""Wow, you support trash, unlike BTS who are saints and can do no wrong. Continue supporting evil, which means you're a bad person yourself.""

Do these people actually believe BTS will be applauding them for attacking other random k-pop fans for liking other artists?

Also, while we're on the topic of Big Bang. What's with the comments bringing Taeyang into every post about Big Bang members? Isn't there a rule on this sub where you shouldn't name idols who aren't directly related to the scandal? Yet I see comments like ""tAeyaNg iSnT a goOd pErsoN bEcaUsE hE kNoWs whAts gOinG oN"". Or maybe wait till he gets in trouble himself before spewing accusations? That's toxic behavior in itself.

Do you all agree with the overall consensus that K-pop fans are the most toxic?

In my opinion, we really need to stop HEAVILY depending on PSY's entertainment company to make everything great.

Yes, PSY is an important figure in KPOP, having one of the most successful music videos, but we are making him look like he is the great, god that will make everything great. His company is still new, so any problems that his company may have will probably come up as his company progresses. I am not hating on PSY, but a lot of people have a dark side, no matter how good they look to the public, and that could include PSY. 

For an example, Seungri. Before his news, nobody besides BIGBANG themselves really speculated anything, and he was still the ""Great Gatsby of Korea"" at that time. I'm not saying the same will happen to PSY, but no one knows.

This might be a little bit weird but has anyone else experienced this?

First of all I want to clarify that Im not forcing them to listen to kpop. I just mention it from time, like when were chatting, I send them a dance practice video, or a song I know theyll enjoy saying something along the lines of he dances so well, I wish I could dance like that, or this song is similar to [insert song], I think you might like it. Basically not gushing, nor sending an extreme fangirly comment, you know what Im talking about.

 Their first reaction would be the typical ew, is that kpop? Thats f*cking gay. Im aware that they might be put off by the community (especially since they use Twitter a lot, and all what they see is the negative parts of each fandom). However, when I send them a girl group video, they will watch it despite not liking the song. We all know theyre all so gorgeous, and one cant help but appreciate their visuals despite not liking the song. 

Im not saying that my friends are ugly or anything, but I do think that they might feel insecure towards male idols. Females also sometimes experience insecurity when they come across with some celebrities, including myself, and I completely understand that. But what I dont get is that they go to the extent of insulting and bashing them. 

Of course, if they dont want to watch/listen, then I respect their opinion... but it just kinda sucks how youre trying to show them something cool and something you know theyd like, only to be completely put off because its kpop.",41,0,False,self,,,,,

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

1561,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-8-9,2019,8,9,22,co2h4g,self.kpop,SM is not helping NCT. This is what I think SM should do.,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/co2h4g/sm_is_not_helping_nct_this_is_what_i_think_sm/,imma-dragon-rawr,1565357800,"Hello, lately I have been very frustrated with SM's management of NCT. And I know there's a lot of other people who are also frustrated. So I am going to use reddit to rant about what SM should do with NCT at the group's current situation.

First, let me say I do not hate their ""limitless"" concept. I think it could work, IF SM knew what they were doing, which they obviously don't. Because of this, SM should just stop. NCT should not add any more members. It should stay as a 21 membered group. I've always thought the graduation system in Dream would fail, and it looks like I was right, but I'll talk about that later.

Make NCT a set group with 21, but also make 127, Dream, and WayV set too. Four out of the six dreamies are graduating soon, and we still haven't seen the new rookies. WHERE ARE THEY SM!? What's gonna happen to the graduated members? Haechan still has 127, and there's a chance Renjun could go to WayV, but what about Jaemin and Jeno? 127 is already a set unit so they can't go there! Are the new dreamies gonna have to due more mature concepts with their baby faces? Or are Chenle and Jisung going back to ""Chewing Gum"" like songs? Or is Dream just gonna be Chensung? WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING SM!? JUST MAKE DREAM A SET UNIT!!!

So NCT officially has 21 members and will not add any more. 127, Dream, and WayV will also not have any member changes. SM kicked Winwin out of 127 and didn't say anything about it. So what I am thinking, is that SM should come out and say Winwin is officially only promoting with WayV and not apart of 127. The same should also be said about Haechan, him only being in 127, to avoid a Dream-doesn't-have-a-comeback-for-ten-months situation, and so Haechan won't overwork himself.

This will leave each member to be apart of one set unit. 9 members in 127, 5 in Dream, and 7 in WayV. NCT U can be the unit to mix-and-match members. This could lead to some fun and interesting combinations and concepts. No offense to the members, but I'm highkey getting tired of the same four same people.

This is just my opinion. I highly doubt SM will ever do this. I don't even know how realistic it would be with ""WayV not being apart of NCT"" and such. This might be a little biased because I stan ot21 and was dreading when SM was going to add new members, but would accept it and grow to like the new members. But now I think SM has no idea what they're doing. 

TL;DR: SM sucks at managing NCT and should stop adding new members",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I grew up around kpop and am very much familiar with a lot of it. Through different phases, I went through a few groups I loved. Currently I am a huge fan of nct. Besides nct and other groups I also loved in the past, I am pretty indifferent about all the other groups.

Now, a friend of mine, who is a huge bts fan, messages me the other day asking if Ive heard about the bts movie. I say no, and he says we have to watch it. This guy and I are not even close enough for us to go watch a movie one-on-one without me feeling uncomfortable. On top of that, he knows I have no interest in bts. So I politely said I wasnt interested. 

If it ended here it wouldve been fine, but instead, this guy starts sending all these screenshots of how well the movie is doing, how its rated higher than lion king, how much the audience loved it, etc. I tell him, of course it does well, since the audience for the movie is largely the fan base. He argues back, trying to start a WHOLE DEBATE about why I should go watch this movie. 

Wow, this really made me have a certain feeling for bts for a second. Of course, Im not going to hold this feeling against them. But all of you crazy fans (of any kpop artists) out there, myself included, should realize that your efforts to making people love your artist might actually go against your intentions. Always be mindful/respectful while being a fan! End of my rant hahaha.",2,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm very curious as to what other kpoppies think of this, as it's a pretty touchy subject and often held against us by non - fans. Does it affect your love for an idol how much they love you back?

I'm trying to purchase some kpop merch and I'm very unfamiliar with purchasing merch from sites like Ktown4u, Kpoptown, CatchopCD etc. I normally go to eBay for kpop merch, but the sellers I normally purchase from are increasing their prices for the item I'm looking for, or, they don't have it listed. I was wondering what websites/sellers you'd recommend and ones you would avoid, and why. 

I've heard mixed reviews about Ktown4u and YesAsia, and then really bad reviews about Kpoptown (but I still see a lot of people purchasing from them, so I'm not sure who to trust haha). I've heard really good things about CatchopCD, but because of their limited catalogue, I'm not sure what site I should buy from. 

I normally go to eBay as I live in Australia, and if you live in Australia, you would probably be familiar with how expensive shipping things are from overseas. This is why I go to eBay so I can purchase a lot of albums without having to pay for shipping. Of course, most of the time I wouldn't get tracking numbers or really fast shipping, but I would much rather wait a few weeks then pay $100 just for 1 or 2 albums to arrive .

***For those wondering, here are the eBay sellers I normally buy from:***

**6tenshop** \-  [https://www.ebay.com/usr/6tenshop](https://www.ebay.com/usr/6tenshop) 

**goods-store07** \-  [https://www.ebay.com.au/usr/goods-store07?\_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2754](https://www.ebay.com.au/usr/goods-store07?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2754) 

I have also purchased from [this](https://www.ebay.com.au/usr/goodstuff_mall?_trksid=p2057872.m2748.l2754) seller, however, they got my address COMPLETELY wrong, and managed to send the albums to a city an hour's drive away from my own address. They did give me a full refund, however it took them a long time to respond when I sent them a message about my albums not arriving (I waited over two months for them to arrive before I sent a message).

The best example I can think of is when BTS were performing in Singapore where the stage is really slippery - Jimin falls over near the start of DNA and realises it would be too dangerous to perform the last part of the choreo, and starting from him, the message is spread between all the members in a matter of literal seconds with only a few small hand gestures between each person whilst they simulataneously perform the song, so by the end they manage to change their positioning and staging without ruining the performance, as seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Yem4uV75k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Yem4uV75k)

But then after i take a look at the long history of TVXQ! and compared them to the rest of 2nd generation idols, i can't help but think to myself, *aren't they just freaking amazing*??

I mean think about it, they lost **more than half (3/5)** of their original lines-up, their fandom and lublic supports were halved more than half, went on hiatus for years and **(they are still the unindisputable Kings of Kpop and the greatest 2nd generation idol ever** nowadays

Lets look at some of their impressive feats:

- They held a Nissan Stadium tour back in 2013 **after 10 years** in their career and were the best selling Korean artist of all times at the time (**They are the 2nd best selling Korean artist of all times as of now with 16 Million records, my bias BTS just recently surpassed them this year and it's a great honor for both ARMY and BTS**)

- They set and broke multiple records as foreign artist in Japan, **the 2nd biggest music industry** from 2011-till now which is incredible because they are way passed their 10 years mark.

- They still hold the record for the **highest-grossing tour of all tiem by Korean artist as of now with Begin Again Tour that grossed more than $200 Million USD**

- They held their 2nd concert in Nissan Stadium back in 2018 for 3 days and set a new record for foreign artist. They grossed $55 Million USD from tickets and merchandises. What makes this even more amazing than it alraedy is, is the fact that TVXQ! was **15 years old group** at the time. If that isn't the definition of epic, then idk what is. Especialy in a fast-paced industry like Kpop

- TVXQ! is still the highest grossing Korean artist of all times as of now with more than $2 Billion USD in revenue. They are *objectively speaking*, the most successful Korean artist of all times revenue and career wise.


Those are merely some of their amazing feats (**trust me, i have go over their fansites to see their records, impacts, and shit tons of other things and they are just stupidly amazing**)

Compared to all their peers, TVXQ! seems like they are on a league of their own. **I mean no offense in this, but to put it into perspective**, lets go over what happend to some of the major groups in 2nd generation idols and you will understand what i meant:

#SNSD

- Lost 1 member in 2014 when they were still a 7 years old group and then slowly start declining real fast. 

- By the time they reach their 10 years mark in 2017, they were alraedy overshadowed by 3rd Generation idols, particularly TWICE.

- Nowadays, SNSD is completely overshadow by 3rd Gen acts and they are only **12 years old**

#Bigbang

- They start to become popular and huge outside of Korea and particularly Asia in 2012 long after their debut, that's quiet long compared to other groups like TVXQ!, Super Junior or SS501 who paved the way for Kpop in Asia as early as 2005 - 2010 ish. Anyway, bigbang reached their peak in 2015-2016 ish and went on hiatus in 2017.

- By the time they reached their 10 years mark, their name is still quiet huge but not comparable to the rise of BTS, EXO, Twice and many other 3rd Gen acts

- Now in 2019, as a 13 years old group, Bigbang's fame, achievements and name have been completely surpassed and overhsadowed by alot of 3rd Gen acts, particularly BTS. Especially with the current scandals and all the horrible crimes that some of the members did, Bigbang's reputation in Korea has been tarnished and no longer the same as before.

#SUJU

- They are one of the earlier spearheads of Kpop in Asia back in 2000's along with DBSK, BoA etc.

- They reach their peak in 2010-2012 ish, wiining countless awards. By the time they reached their 10 years mark in 2015, their momentum began to decline

- They also lost some members but not comparable to TVXQ! whom have lost **more than half of their lines-up**

- Some of their members also committed scandals and put the group in the bad light.


I hope ya'll understand what i'm trying to deliver here, if you look at most 2nd Gen Idols and compared them to TVXQ!, the difference in their longetivity, long-lasing impacts, touring power, fame, and achievements differs greatly. I mean even now, when BTS is currently on the top of the world when it comes to music, they still **have not completely overshadow the greatness or legendary status of TVXQ! as opposed to the other 2nd Gen Idols who are completely overshadowed by BTS, TWICE, EXO and more**. 

They have that special feels that made them stands out and different than the others. To me, it was their contributions and long-lasting impacts that truly made them special and unindisputable among other 2nd Gen idols. Compared to others, we can **legitimately** credits TVXQ! for paving the way to Kpop and all their peers in Japan and Asia back in early 2000's - 2010 ish, no one can deny that. 

In fact, **as an Army myself** (*disclaimer: i'm not speaking on behalf of my fandom here, just myself alone*), if there's any senior group i'd acknowledged whom **legitimately** paved the way for BTS and **not just vaguely** , it would be TVXQ! themselves and none others. Their impacts and contributions are impossible to deny and till this day Asia and particularly Japan, is still the biggest market that Kpop as a whole industry generated their money and incomes from, which would trasnlated to economy in itself. That alone made TVXQ! the biggest contributor for Kpop industry in term of international expansion.

I may not be their fan, but i want to let people know that i have high respect for these men for what they have done. **Vaguely and indirectly, as an Army i can thank Seo Taiji, SUJU, Bigbang, Michael Jackson, Beethoven and even Mozart for paving the way for BTS because without Mozart, none of our faves would exists today. But in all seriousness and jokes aside, i want to thank TVXQ! for legtitimately and directly paving the way in Japan and Asia not only to BTS but the entire Kpop industry as a whole**


**I wish that someday, BTS will be remember in Kpop as the ones who paved the way in the US and the west, just like what TVXQ! did in Japan and Asia.**

As someone who is a fan of both Kpop and Vocaloid, it's always been interesting thinking of mixing the two.

For context, Vocaloid are vocal synthesizers. Basically, a music producer can input lyrics &amp; melody into a program and tweak it a little to create a voice that sings along to songs. I'm gonna be using the term interchangeably for other vocal synthesizers as well, like utauloid, synthv, etc

However, I think the mainstream idea is that Vocaloid live performances are weird/not that great at best. Most of you who've seen a video of vocaloid live (if you've ever even seen one before) would probably have seen a video dated around 2013-15, with a really stiff, unrealistic hologram and the idea of paying to see that doesn't seem like a great plan.

Recently I stumbled on [these two](https://youtu.be/C3E5fb39xcs) [recent videos](https://youtu.be/0USE9AMu8i8). Granted, it's still a stiff, but I see a lot of resemblence between the performance and a live Kpop idol performance. Putting aside the fact it's in English/Japanese, and is done by a hologram, there's the dancing, back up dancers, the songs are catchy as well- if you squint enough the movements almost look human.

So after looking into more videos, I discovered another (significantly older, 2012) video of the [Vocaloid SeeU](https://youtu.be/Sb8ZaXx0qQM) performing with the group GLAM. She's singing in the video, and the model and voice bank is really old, but it's not that bad.

And another example, albeit not actually vocaloids, is the [KDA stage with the AR models](https://youtu.be/p9oDlvOV3qs). They don't sing, but they're there, and they're enticing.

Theoretically, it makes sense. Kpop idols are expected to sing, dance and have the perfect personality, but they're human. That's their once vice, they can't physically be perfect.

But a virtual idol can.

They can sing with [almost lifelike emotions](https://youtu.be/yqzAgPmtPVM) and they can [dance convincingly](https://youtu.be/elfcprFRtZ8). We have [virtual youtubers](https://youtu.be/pU3iGpwKxKc) with millions of subscribers, [virtual instagram influencers](https://instagram.com/imma.gram?igshid=dju6w7u5kfyi) with thousands of followers...

Heck, we even had hologram Tupac.

I guess what I'm pitching is that technology is advancing so soon, it could potentially take over or even replace the Kpop wave we're experiencing right now. We're definitely not at that stage yet, but maybe some day.

Would you ever pay to see virtual idol perform? Would you ever stan a virtual/fictional idol? What are your thoughts on the whole idea?

Share your thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/colptg/redditors_of_rkpop_what_are_your_thoughts_about/,ZEROINDRA,1565461827,"....... For me, it's TVXQ!. I truly respect and acknowledge these guys

I'm just a casual listener/fan of 2nd and 3rd Gen idols in general and actually an ARMY myself. But then after i take a look at the long history of TVXQ! and compared them to the rest of 2nd generation idols, i can't help but think to myself, *aren't they just freaking amazing*??

I mean think about it, they lost **more than half (3/5)** of their original lines-up, their fandom and lublic supports were halved more than half, went on hiatus for years and **they are still the unindisputable Kings of Kpop and the greatest 2nd generation idol ever** nowadays

Lets look at some of their impressive feats:

- They held a Nissan Stadium tour back in 2013 **after 10 years** in their career and were the best selling Korean artist of all times at the time (**They are the 2nd best selling Korean artist of all times as of now with 16 Million records, my bias BTS just recently surpassed them this year and it's a great honor for both ARMY and BTS**)

- They set and broke multiple records as foreign artist in Japan, **the 2nd biggest music industry** from 2011-till now which is incredible because they are way passed their 10 years mark.

- They still hold the record for the **highest-grossing tour of all tiem by Korean artist as of now with Begin Again Tour that grossed more than $200 Million USD**

- They held their 2nd concert in Nissan Stadium back in 2018 for 3 days and set a new record for foreign artist. They grossed $55 Million USD from tickets and merchandises. What makes this even more amazing than it alraedy is, is the fact that TVXQ! was **15 years old group** at the time. If that isn't the definition of epic, then idk what is. Especialy in a fast-paced industry like Kpop

- TVXQ! is still the highest grossing Korean artist of all times as of now with more than $2 Billion USD in revenue. They are *objectively speaking*, the most successful Korean artist of all times revenue and career wise.


Those are merely some of their amazing feats (**trust me, i have go over their fansites to see their records, impacts, and shit tons of other things and they are just stupidly amazing**)

Compared to all their peers, TVXQ! seems like they are on a league of their own. **I mean no offense in this, but to put it into perspective**, lets go over what happend to some of the major groups in 2nd generation idols and you will understand what i meant:

#SNSD

- Lost 1 member in 2014 when they were still a 7 years old group and then slowly start declining real fast. 

- By the time they reach their 10 years mark in 2017, they were alraedy overshadowed by 3rd Generation idols, particularly TWICE.

- Nowadays, SNSD is completely overshadow by 3rd Gen acts and they are only **12 years old**

#Bigbang

- They start to become popular and huge outside of Korea and particularly Asia in 2012 long after their debut, that's quiet long compared to other groups like TVXQ!, Super Junior or SS501 who paved the way for Kpop in Asia as early as 2005 - 2010 ish. Anyway, bigbang reached their peak in 2015-2016 ish and went on hiatus in 2017.

- By the time they reached their 10 years mark, their name is still quiet huge but not comparable to the rise of BTS, EXO, Twice and many other 3rd Gen acts

- Now in 2019, as a 13 years old group, Bigbang's fame, achievements and name have been completely surpassed and overhsadowed by alot of 3rd Gen acts, particularly BTS. Especially with the current scandals and all the horrible crimes that some of the members did, Bigbang's reputation in Korea has been tarnished and no longer the same as before.

#SUJU

- They are one of the earlier spearheads of Kpop in Asia back in 2000's along with DBSK, BoA etc.

- They reach their peak in 2010-2012 ish, wiining countless awards. By the time they reached their 10 years mark in 2015, their momentum began to decline

- They also lost some members but not comparable to TVXQ! whom have lost **more than half of their lines-up**

- Some of their members also committed scandals and put the group in the bad light.


I hope ya'll understand what i'm trying to deliver here, if you look at most 2nd Gen Idols and compared them to TVXQ!, the difference in their longetivity, long-lasing impacts, touring power, fame, and achievements differs greatly. I mean even now, when BTS is currently on the top of the world when it comes to music, they still **have not completely overshadow the greatness or legendary status of TVXQ! as opposed to the other 2nd Gen Idols who are completely overshadowed by BTS, TWICE, EXO and more**. 

They have that special feels that made them stands out and different than the others. To me, it was their contributions and long-lasting impacts that truly made them special and unindisputable among other 2nd Gen idols. Compared to others, we can **legitimately** credits TVXQ! for paving the way to Kpop and all their peers in Japan and Asia back in early 2000's - 2010 ish, no one can deny that. 

In fact, **as an Army myself** (*disclaimer: i'm not speaking on behalf of my fandom here, just myself alone*), if there's any senior group i'd acknowledged whom **legitimately** paved the way for BTS and **not just vaguely** , it would be TVXQ! themselves and none others. Their impacts and contributions are impossible to deny and till this day Asia and particularly Japan, is still the biggest market that Kpop as a whole industry generated their money and incomes from, which would trasnlated to economy in itself. That alone made TVXQ! the biggest contributor for Kpop industry in term of international expansion.

I may not be their fan, but i want to let people know that i have high respect for these men for what they have done. **Vaguely and indirectly, as an Army i can thank Seo Taiji, SUJU, Bigbang, Michael Jackson, Beethoven and even Mozart for paving the way for BTS because without Mozart, none of our faves would exists today. But in all seriousness and jokes aside, i want to thank TVXQ! for legtitimately and directly paving the way in Japan and Asia not only to BTS but the entire Kpop industry as a whole**


**I wish that someday, BTS will be remember in Kpop as the ones who paved the way in the US and the west, just like what TVXQ! did in Japan and Asia.**

What are some examples you've seen of good or bad effort?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/corq8k/in_light_of_the_monsta_xfrench_montana_situation/,VariousPackage,1565493427,"If you are not aware of this, French Montana forgot his lines twice during [Monsta X's Jimmy Kimmel](https://youtu.be/umvIZMI6hSA) performance, he seemed disoriented throughout his 30 seconds performance. It showed lack of professionalism from his side which was embarrassing for all the parties involved and their fans.

Some of the good examples would be:

1. Halsey showed up at BTS' concert in Paris to perform BWL with them. She didn't have to come, it wasn't a tv show or studio performance, it was BTS' private concert. She came anyway and performed the song with them. 
2. Same thing happened with Blackpink and Dua Lipa in New York, when Dua made a surprise appearance at BP's concert and performed Kiss and Makeup with them.
3. Another good example would be John Legend and Red Velvet Wendy's collaboration. John Legend is a big name, he is the youngest EGOT winner (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony). He doesn't need K-Pop clout to stay relevant yet he collaborated with Wendy. He gave his time to SM, learned and recorded the song in the studio, went to another location to film the MV and teasers and even promoted the song on social media.

In my opinion, Kpop groups should only collaborate with artists who are genuinely interested in making music with them.  What do you think of this?

When I was around 5-8 years old I would dance to the song and music video. I always thought it was a Jpop song but turns out it was a Kpop song. Song probably came out in the early 2000's because that's around when I was born. It's been 10 years since I first saw that music video and I still remember parts vividly.

I'll write my best description, if anyone knows the band or song I'm talking about; please help.

It's a girl group, 4-6 members. The music video is very upbeat and happy and colorful but not trippy. I remember one girl having short hair and another having curls. They would dance in different decorated and colored rooms. The most specific part I remember is when they all go outside and have those weird cat paw gloves on. The toe beans are squishy and not fabric and they start to paint this big wall. They dip the toe beans (the pads on cat paws) into paint and put paw prints on the wall and they all have fun.

I believe they have another music video where they're making dessert and getting each other messy.

1816,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-8-12,2019,8,12,0,coxq43,self.kpop,Are there any Japanese K-pop MVs that you like more than the Korean version?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/coxq43/are_there_any_japanese_kpop_mvs_that_you_like/,hainelol,1565535604,"Hi, everyone! Recently, I've been in a Pentagon-related journey. I was surprised by how different the [Shine Japanese version MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR3Z_8r1LHE) is when compared to their [Korean one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu2yQ1zYDYU). In my opinion, the Japanese MV is so much more fun than the Korean one (I love the ""photo editing"" effects and the sheer chaos in some moments). The Japanese MV for Momoland's Bboom Bboom is also completely different from the Korean one. 

Usually, as far as I know, the MV tends to be the same for Japanese and Korean versions, with some minor differences (like GOT7's Just Right MV, that has some different shots. For example, when Youngjae shows up, he is sitting on top of the cereal box, while in the Korean version he's in the front of it). Or sometimes k-pop artists release Japanese MVs for previously released songs that didn't have a Korean MV. An example would be BTS's Airplane pt 2, which is a pretty nice MV. And, more often, the idols release a completely new song in Japanese, rather than making a version of their Korean songs for the MV (like GOT7's Love Loop, NCT 127's Wakey Wakey and the recent Twice's Japanese comeback).

So it surprised me that there are some songs with completely different MVs for their Korean and Japanese releases. So my proposed questions for this discussion are:

* Are there any K-pop MVs that you liked the Japanese version of the MV more than the Korean Version? And which they are and why?
* Can you think of examples of the Japanese MV being completely different from the Korean Version (as in Shine's and Bboom Bboom's case?)
* Or are there any Japanese Versions for K-pop MVs that you dislike or think are worse than the original Korean Version?

So, what do you think about Japanese MVs?",42,44,False,self,,,,,

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/clzy06/nugu_roundup_5_busting_out_190804/). While the full album hasn't dropped yet we do have a new MV (with several versions) from Pink Fantasy - so let's get to know them.

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Trivia:**  Pink Fantasy has one of the widest age ranges - a spread of 14 years from their youngest to their oldest member.  Their MVs for Iriwa and Fantasy have both been directed and produced by Super Junior's Shindong.  Pink Fantasy has a pre-debut member 'Rai' who appeared in the Iriwa MV, but who left and was replaced by Yubin pre-debut.  They're fans of Japanese trend-setting group Morning Musume.  They seem to have a large number of fans in Spanish-speaking nations by evidence of YouTube comments.  They've said they want to switch up concepts between comebacks.

**Active Between:** March 21st 2017 - May 24th 2019

**Reason for Disbanding:** A subject that still garners a lot of theories, but the root cause seems to be mismanagement by PLEDIS.  While Pristin debuted to great success, PLEDIS failed to promote the group and kept them dungeoned for extended periods of time leading to fans drifting away and members seeking out other opportunities.  

**Trivia:** Pristin featured six Produce alumni, including two I.O.I. members.  Pristin won Rookie of the Year during their debut year.  They also won awards for Best New Female Artist, Best New Artist, and Top 5 Global Rookies during their first year.  Their disbandment is one of the more shocking because they looked every bit like a group destined for huge success right out of the gate.  Fan theories include PLEDIS finding co-management profits for IZ\*ONE and Fromis\_9 easier ways to earn money than developing and promoting their own group.

I just wanted it to end so much! Its slowly going doing with the exception of couple of songs here and there. But right now the Noise market picking up trend I do not like. Songs that arent cohesive or follow standard structure, or just songs that sound like massive yelling Im not fond of right now. Example songs released recently are Zimzalabim, ICY,Stray kidz song Side Effects and then recently SVT new song is a bit noisy for my taste, like I could always rely on SVT songs and Im familiar with their sound but this was left field.  Those r the top that come to my mind. Maybe it will just take time for me to get used to this new sort of trend that sounds like songs from 2010 or something but at the moment Im not feeling it. 

Let me know trends of kpop you are currently tired of, can be fashion, music, video production, redundant touring locations etc. Plz dnt get ur feelings hurt these r just my opinions I like all the groups I mentioned I just am not feeling the Noise Trend",360,146,False,self,,,,,

Got what it takes to stand up to the evil adults of the world? Here's your mission! Each week you get the chance to review seven songs on Jukebox. Listen to the song(s) you want to review and then leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song(s) in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song is definitely not for YOU, and 10 being this song is a revolution! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can also use the MV to inform your overall score  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

You can keep reviewing songs until this Saturday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your reviews and comments in by then!

I'm working on a radio project for college, and was thinking about including some kpop in the mix of songs for the programming.

The rules for the radio project dictate that we can not include suggestive songs (so only pg13 stuff), nor artists involved in scandals with drugs, crimes, etc. We really have to focus on artists who could be viewed as role models for anybody.

As a second gen fan, a few of my favorite groups would have to be disconsidered 'cause of inadequate language, and drugs scandals, unfortunately.  :(

I was wondering if anyone could help me out with some family friendly groups and songs suggestions -specifically when it comes to newer artists.

I appreciate the attention and help. Hope you guys have a great day! ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1. One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.
2. for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.
4. Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

P.S: I finished my 4th video on [I.O.I](https://youtu.be/WYualQj2YDA). Still need more work on getting better. but i'm getting better! = D

Here are some of my ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

Dua Lipa covering Me &amp; You by EXID- I feel like Dua's voice could fit in really well with this kind of song and if she changed a little bit of the production a little bit, it could totally have been a song on her first album.

Lady Gaga covering Sixth Sense by Brown Eyed Girls- Although Gaga has kind of strayed into the folk/acoustic kind of music with A Star is Born and Joanne, I could see someone with her level of vocal ability killing this song solo. Also, I think she would be able to give a great theatrical performance to go along with this song.

Justin Timberlake covering Mirotic by TVXQ- I could definitely see ""Sexy Back"" era Justin Timberlake slaying something like this. Mirotic doesn't really sound like anything he released recently on Man of the Woods, but he could still do something like this now I think. 

Zara Larsson covering Kill This Love by Blackpink- Idk why I think this would work, but Zara definitely has the vocals to pull off this song, plus she can actually dance. 

Anne Marie covering Don't Know What To Do- This song seems right up her alley sound-wise, and I feel like her voice tone would match with the soft and loud parts of the song. 

Ariana Grande covering Snapping by Chungha- Their voices sound similar and I would honestly just love to hear Ari cover this song. 

Brendon Urie covering Rooftop by N.Flying- Brendon could definitely do justice to this song and can definitely reach the high notes in the chorus. Plus his voice has that extra grit that the chorus really needs so I could see him doing a fantastic cover. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have more songs that I could probably come up with, but this is all I can think of off the top of my head. What do you guys think?",13,26,False,self,,,,,

EXO is my favorite group so if CIX manages to have the same musical consistency and growth then I can definitely see myself becoming a fan. Are three letter boygroups with X in their name my kryptonite? Guess we will see.

Monster - Bigbang
Monster - Exo
Monster - Henry Lau
Fly - Got7
Fly - Gaho
Fly - Cross gene
Fly - Jessica
And the list goes on - Sometimes it's just a random word but somehow its suited for a song titel to a bunch of Korean artists.

I'm thinking of ordering the X1 album off Kpoptown through DHL because it is the fastest option. 

Has anyone ordered off Kpoptown using DHL and were you provided with a tracking code? I'm a bit worried because I live in New Zealand and the shipping is so expensive even costing more than the actual albums itself.

Can anyone provide any reviews on Kpoptown or any other alternative sites?

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.**  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release from the month listed in the title* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

(1) has a detailed/overproduced instrumental (NCTs superhuman)

(2) uses unconventional/distorted sounds (NCTs chain)

(3) is heavily EDM with an instrumental chorus (stray kidzs side effects)

(4) has little transition between sections (red velvets zimzalabim)

or some combination of those four.

other songs/artists commonly classified as noise music:

NCT: wakey-wakey, simon says, black on black, cherry bomb

red velvet: ice cream cake, RBB, sappy, rookie

itzy: ICY, dalla dalla

stray kidzs miroh

blackpinks kill this love

i dont listen to much ATEEZ but i hear their name thrown in there too

i think noise music is supposed to be a derogatory term but most of the songs i just listed are my favorites  except for maybe ZZB i would have never thought that there was anything crazy about these songs. perhaps i just listen to too much f(x) but noise music for me is just business as usual. i know reddit kpop fans in particular tend to like kpop more for the music though, so thoughts?",63,34,False,self,,,,,

With the concept ""evaluation"" round last week, the benefit votes has shaken up the rankings. Head over to the [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/kpoproduce-2) to find out who survive.

This also means that the votes will be reset for this round. There will be 3 weeks of voting and next week, we will have the position ""evaluation"" round. Just like last season, I will refer to [Kprofiles](kprofiles.com) to determine the positions they include. I will explain it more next week.

For these 2 weeks, you will also be voting for which idols suits best for the respective concept ""evaluation"" songs. You are to choose 7 idols for each of the song. You are allowed to choose an idol for more than one song if you want to. 

For the weekly voting, there is a change for this week. Instead of listing the 60 idols in 7 different sections, I have only included one section. You are still allowed to vote up to SEVEN times if you want. You just have to submit it individually, like how it was done last season. I'm just wondering if some people doesn't really wanna go through all the seven sections in previous rounds even though I mentioned you don't have to choose people for all 7 sections if you don't want to. If there's no significant voting changes, then I will revert back to the previous forms next week again. You can head over [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWmHY1o8QZW2Tugxdkbu04Qd69rnM4GHOtOzH55Q6PqB3lTg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to vote.

For the concept evaluation songs, you are also allowed to vote up to seven times for this week. So, just submit it again if you wish to vote more than once. Head over [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwgY_5lCF-uEoS1LkXsUsRfD8BtznuN3mGlqX62CkAKOf7KA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to vote. 

I will welcome any feedback also in trying to improve the game. So do feel free to comment here or PM me.

In the latest edition of the the [""Off The Pill Podcast""](https://youtu.be/I8nWBgUq-n4?t=2207) by popular old school youtuber Ryan Higa (nigahiga), this week\`s guest was Jun Sung Ahn, an upcoming kpop idol and violinist.   
Its a good podcast, recommend watching it, but the subject of this post is the following:

The host asks Jun had any **""rude encounters from famous kpop idols""** to to which he replies: (paraphrased)  
""At KCON I do this thing, I MC, because I\`m bilingual, so they have this things called fan engagements where they come on stage and answer questions, like an interview.  
I take the question, I ask it in korean, I translate them for the audience.  
...  
There was this one specific member of his girl group that was just completely different on stage than how she was off stage, like the second she got off stage, she called for a manager to get her water... Like a really bitchy diva, to the point that on stage was very bubbly and the second she came down, her smile disappeared, her face completely changed...""  
After that, the host asks for a name and jokingly imply that he might be talking about BLACKPINK, then the subject carries on.

What am i trying to find out is what girl group or member was he talking about.  
A girl how **smiles** a lot on stage, from **big girl group** which **attended KNCON** in US, which held a **fan engagement** and at which **Jun was MC**.

Some info:   
\-interview is held in Las Vegas, Jun might is based in Los Angeles and he is from New Jersey  
\-according with Juns wikipedia page, he attended both kcon **LA** and NY  
\-blackpink never attended kcon  
\-Jun also mentions that its one of the biggest girl groups

There is quite some info to comb trough (like the lineup of kcon LA and maybe NY) and lots of unknowns for me, so help me out. :)   
Again, this is purely for curiosity, make of it a fun internet hive mind demonstration and not a witch hunt.

My first uneducated guess was:  
&gt;!Kcon LA 2018 Twice Fan engagement /watch?v=RuH4R-Eat2c, but lots of holes in my guess since can\`t tell that well who the mc is and twice do not really smile that much here.!&lt;",0,1,False,self,,,,,

1. The Atmosphere and Merchandise
So the first thing I felt when I stepped out of Stadium Station was huge excitement was in the air. Every person around the area are all just so excited that we finally get to see him on stage again. 
His fan demographic is so wide, but seeing this in reality was insane. You see a group of ladies in their 50s and 60s up to school kids in their teens attending. Also, you get to see a sea of pink outfits. Take note that Daniel decided to only let us know of his desired dress code of pink the day before of the fanmeet. So the mall next door to the Indoor Stadium got some sales boost from fans buying pink tops from H&amp;M and Uniqlo. 
The merchandise, oh boy the merchandise. The merchandise booth opened at 12 noon, I got in at 1.30 pm and did not get to buy anything until 3.30pm, with only 3 things out of the 8 in the merchandise list available for sale. I got my hands on the glow stick and the slogan. The glow stick was a nice alternative for the lack of light stick for nonames (Daniels fandom), it was literally a giant glow stick with 3 colours on it. The slogan was simple, it only had words on it but it was light reflective so it made for a nice touch when you see the crowd. The price is what the fans appreciated, I bought both items for a total price of $32. Thats ridiculously reasonable priced for kpop concert merchandise from experience. The most expensive item in the list was the slogan coming in at $20. 

2. The show itself
If youre a Daniel fan, this is a definitely must on your list Im telling you. Get yourself a category you can afford and go experience it for yourself, its fantastic. 
The MC of the night balanced out Nielchin (the sexier version of Daniel that we see on stage) and Nielging (default cuter boyish Daniel that we see off stage) and allowed Daniel to show both and keep all fans happy. The games were a lot fun, and hes as always a good sport and puts in his all in entertaining us. He even ate durian, yes the actual fruit, and politely said the smell isnt too bad. 
Also this boy is a dance machine. Its no joke.
Speaking of dance, Horizon, oh boy Horizon. This was the one song he didnt perform on the fan showcase during his debut and now we know why. The choreography is so sexy, Im not even sure if half the stadium was still conscious afterwards. Hes teased that theres a wave in the choreography that we should look forward to, mate you wanted half of your fandom dead. This choreography makes Wanna Ones Day by Day choreography look tame.
He chose Justin Beibers Sorry for his cover stage, and this performance was brilliant. This song will never feel the same again for nonames I think. His vocals were leaps and bounds better than his fan showcase, you can actually hear him sing here and his performance of Color went through with definitely less struggle than last time.

3. The off-script question 
The MC asked Daniel if hes still in touch with Wanna One. He was caught off guard a little and took it well and said that hes still in touch with them. He even asked Ong for help about overcoming his nerves while performing. Take what you will about this one. But its a question that needed to be asked.

4. The meet and greet
So I was one of the lucky few who could do the meet and greet. They take you away to a small room and basically take 2 photos with him, school photos style. This boy just looks so different in person. I mean this in the best way possible, but he looked so different to how I expected him to. He actually looked angelic in the flesh, its an actual miracle how Nielchin shows up on stage. He was very cheerful and very nice with he 2 minutes I got to share a room with him. 
Ill add the stuff Ive heard about the send off party, I didnt get to go but apparently, they gathered in one area and he held every persons hand in there. It was also all over within minutes but the fans went wild for it.

5. In conclusion 
The fans still very much love Daniel. Why? Because hes so sincere in everything he does, and it showed in this fanmeet. Thats all you need to know about him. The MC sang him praises after he went off stage and it kept consistent with whatever everyone else whos worked with him have said. Hes just a real nice guy.

tl;dr: If youre a Daniel fan, buy a ticket that you can afford and watch it yourself. You wont regret it.",24,128,False,self,,,,,

Examples of original choreo: [one](https://youtu.be/EmrNMf_jzkE?t=52) [two](https://youtu.be/EmrNMf_jzkE?t=110) [three](https://youtu.be/EmrNMf_jzkE?t=163)

honestly, i UNDERSTAND why they changed it, but the original choreography got the point across more and was more true to the message and concept of Voodoo Doll, which is literally the song that cemented VIXX into their concept-dol fame. This was the era i got into VIXX back in 2013, and I'm still mad about it almost 6 years later 

what are some choreos that you either HATED or LOVED the change?",31,47,False,self,,,,,

I think we can come to an agreement that these sites are heavily user submitted posts with no real facts, logic or backing behind them. They have a complete lack of journalistic integrity with blatant clickbait headlines, even often stealing and copying from other sites. Posts can be made with little to no evidence just to defame and spread hate toward an artist. All too often people are getting facts wrong and then their source is one of these sites. I think we can try to limit the spread of this by just not posting/reposting from places like that and then they stop getting the clicks they are looking for.

**These places include:**

Koreaboo

Allkpop

PannChoa

Netizen Buzz

Asian Junkie

While great sources like **Soompi** and **The Seoul Story**  (@/**OH\_mes2** and @/**balloon\_wanted** on twitter are incredible resources for news!) They all fact check before they post anything, dont post gossip ect so why arent we all giving more support to places like them? Posting their articles, hyping them up ect

I would love to know thoughts on this issue, how it effects your groups/idols and if you have more places to recommend for real legitimate news and not gossip sites that relies solely on 'knets replies' or pann posts for clicks. That way more people can know to get their news from real places.",13,18,False,self,,,,,

##Agenda:

- Census 2019 Reminder
- Welcome New Mods!
- How to give feedback/meta complaints
- Tour Review Round-Up Posts - New!
- Spotlight &amp; Album Review Posts Refresher
- Vlog Formatting Guidelines
- Requested Feedback on Various Posting Guidelines
- Future Projects

&amp;nbsp;

***

##Census Reminder:

Were halfway through the month, so [this is your reminder to take the census!](http://census.redditkpop.com/) Thank you to everyone who has taken the census thus far! 

We know its a bit longer than before, but were really excited about the changes and the extra data.

Some of you might have been stuck on redirecting, which appeared to be a bug for a few.  **For the most part, redirecting should be fixed, and working fine now!** If you were having problems in the past, please give it another chance! If you're still having issues, let us know!

&amp;nbsp;

***

##New Moderators:

Some of you may have noticed that we have several new faces in our moderation team, and we have mentioned it but wed like to properly and formally mention it!

Please give a warm welcome to the *seven* new mods we have added to the /r/kpop team: /u/BB_GG, /u/raymondliang, /u/ElegantShitwad /u/Iblaka, /u/shpxl, /u/PoohBae and /u/Conceptizual! 

*Please* show our new mods kindness and understanding as they settle into their new roles. Theres a lot of different rules and a huge learning curve that comes with running /r/kpop. Additionally, our last batch of 5 moderators who were recently promoted from Junior Mods, only joined us 5 months ago, so showing those mods kindness as well should anything come up would be greatly appreciated! Were so grateful to have 12 wonderful people join our team in the past few months to reflect our growing subreddit. We were operating with a skeleton crew for a bit there, so this has lightened the workload considerably for each of us within the team.

&amp;nbsp;

***

##Proper channels for feedback:

On occasion, a user will have a question about why a post was removed. As we just mentioned, we added 12 moderators in the past 5 months and have 16-19 active moderators at any given time. (Sometimes more if our less active mods on the roster make an appearance.) 

The best way to ask about why something is removed is through mod mail. That way we can ask the mod who removed it what happened, if we have any questions, or if theres additional circumstances (ie. It was really a repost, theres extra info, we didnt see that it was a bad source, they had asked someone to submit a certain way, etc).

When users come into other threads to derail them and complain by asking why their threads were removed, its unfair to the OP, and the users enjoying the threads. We ask that you dont disrespect them by doing this. Its also not ideal to tag random mod usernames into such conversations because they might not have been around for your post removal and may have just opened the mobile app while out doing other things and have limited tools to help. Similarly, if a mod doesnt get /u/ tagged, we often find out about this chain of complaints due to reports after they have gone on for some time. In both scenarios, your comments will be removed and you will be told to take it to mod mail. 

In a similar vein, meta feedback such as large complaints, are best given in Town Halls or Mod Mails. We dont allow meta posts, because then the sub would be overrun with meta complaints and ideas. It would no longer be about K-pop but instead a sub about how people think /r/kpop should be run. 

Lastly, stuff like the #/subreddit-discussion channel on the .kpop Discord is really only there for a quick question/answer situation, not for large scale meta feedback or the like. We may have a future solution for better live chat feedback, but were a bit far off from developing it still. 

&amp;nbsp;

##Tour Review Round-Up

We have noticed that people have really enjoyed hearing about K-pop concert reviews, so we wanted to provide a format that allows users to hear about the end of a concert tour in a fun way, similar to an album review two weeks later.

We came up with a round-up that enables users to share as much, or as little, as they wish from a tour in a single post. Users can add just the reviews from a tour, but also stuff like fan cams, artist videos, social media, performances, ticket sales, and more, for a discussion as a sort of a tour wrap-up for users to enjoy together as a new sub feature.

We made a mock-up of one with [just some suggestions](https://imgur.com/a/NtmpoKp) (It's not required to include everything there). The main focus is on reviews, but users can go above and beyond with more content!

We are uncertain if users would enjoy these round-ups at the end of a tour leg, such as the end of a Dome Tour, SEA tour, or US tour, or at the end of an overall tour instead. It would be wonderful if people could provide us with feedback on this so we can best figure out how to utilize this new feature for the sub.

##Spotlights

In the past, we have had a wonderful feature called Spotlight. These posts were often beloved, but for some reason they have fallen by the wayside. 

Essentially, they are a fan lead community project that allows users to highlight their favorite group with what amounts to an info bomb on the artists, their back story, each member and more. Pre-debut info, discographies, music videos, reality shows, social media, their acting gigs, you name it, its there. We try to wait a bit between Spotlights for the same artists so that way if theres an update its fresh information, but theres a ton of them that have never, ever been featured who could likely gain some huge fans through it. 

We have a wiki of all of these posts too, which you should check out to get an idea of how they work, and who all has been featured!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/spotlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/spotlight)

We would love to see more Spotlights in the community! We really encourage our users to engage with this special feature so we can help people discover new groups, or help you recruit more fans to the groups you adore! 


##2 Weeks Later Album Review Round-Ups

If you're creating an album discussion thread or a ""2-weeks later"" thread, you are encouraged to include links to song and album reviews in these threads. It makes sense to talk about those reviews within the context of the album discussion threads. You may also post a separate review round-up thread for any single or album release. Review round-up threads should be text posts and include links to any relevant reviews for the song. They can be from any media source including YouTube video reviews. Thread titles should be formatted:

`Artist - Title (Review Roundup)`

You may also highlight review sources in the title if you wish for example:

`Artist - Title (Review Roundup) - Pitchfork, Spin, Billboard, +more`

Please note, that one or two reviews is not a round-up, so please have at least three reviews ready to link. Additional reviews that are published later or found by other users will be directed to the comments of the round-up post if one exists. 

&amp;nbsp;

***

##Reassessing VLOG title formatting

During the June Town Hall, we introduced the `[VLOG]` flair and in the July Town Hall we created rules for the correct title formatting. 

`Artist - VLOG Title (Date) [RAW/ENG SUB]`[\(See July Town Hall for more detail\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c9esj2/state_of_the_rkpop_subreddit_july_2019_town_hall/)

We received a little feedback from users that this formatting wasn't ideal as it made searching more difficult with titles that do not reflect the title of the actual video enough. This formatting has been in action for about a month, so we want to hear from you how it's going. Should we make adjustments to what is required in the title? What, if anything, can be changed to make them work for us better?

&amp;nbsp;

***

## Feedback requested for various posting guidelines (Hopefully implementing in the September Town Hall)

In this section we have some common problems or types of content that confuse users, but haven't been explicitly handled in our rules. We'd like to clear them up with some feedback from you. Please read through these rule proposals and let us know if anything should be changed or we have missed any critical component.


###Crowdfunding (applies to Makestar, Kickstarter, IndieGogo, Patreon, etc)

We have been overrun by Makestar and similar promotions, and we would like to make the following changes: 

* ONLY the 1st announcement of a new funding project can be posted
* NO other content from the platform can be posted (articles, interviews, images, promotions, etc)
* NO announcements of reaching a goal or stretch goal can be posted
* Monthly round-up posts are allowed, but can be posted ONLY after checking in with Mods [\(Example post\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cd9qhm/kpop_monthly_makestar_roundup_july_august_2019/)


###Music Show Wins

Requirements at the time of posting (if not met, will be removed): 

* Title: `Artist Name... first win... 'Song Title' on Music Show Name (date aired)`
* An image that shows the win
* Optional: Include number scores in comments

Acceptable title examples:

`OH MY GIRL have taken first win for 'BUNGEE (Fall in Love)' on SBS MTV The Show (190813)`

`EXO-SC ""What a life"" earns first win on KBS Music Bank (190802)`

`ATEEZ earns first win with ""WAVE"" today on Mnet M! Countdown (190620)`

###Podcasts:

* Must be hosted by a K-pop artist or a K-pop artist must be present as a guest
* Title: `Artist name(s) - Name and/or number of podcast episode (date posted)`
* Should these be flaired with `[Interview]` or `[Misc]` or should we create `[Podcast]`?

###Western Award Shows:

With the growing popularity of Western Award Shows, we need to decide upon a uniform set of rules. This would apply to shows like the Billboard Music Awards, Grammys, Teen Choice Awards, MTV VMAs, American Music Awards, MTV Europe Music Awards, etc, where there is K-pop representation.

* Nomination announcements should all be collected in one post (ideally as a single article)? Or each nomination gets its own post?
* Results/winning announcement posts should be collected in one post? Or allow each artist to have their own?
* Performances: Always allowed as their own post? Only if they are new music or a special stage? Or performances should only be collected by OP in a live thread for the full show?

&amp;nbsp;

***

##Here are some future projects we are working on 

We are at work on these behind the scenes very hard, and  you will see them in the coming weeks/months, but not this month:

* More Audio Post guidelines (Singles, Singular/Random releases)
* More definition to Fluff (Esp to articles taken from nothing or variety show clips we have already seen.)
* Award Show/Festival season: Guidelines, formatting
* Big visuals post: Community Awards, Post Thumbnails, User flairs, Snoos, etc.
* Giant Charts &amp; Achievements Feedback/Discussion Post
* New Discord
* More AMAs!!!

&amp;nbsp;

Well, we have reached the end of this very long Town Hall. The mods are listening. You have the floor.

VLOG title formatting (keep new rules or relax them to allow actual video title?)
Spotlight Posts
Tour Review Round-up Posts
Music Show win posts (clarify rules/formatting/jumping the gun)


More upcoming stuff:

Z-girls Z-boys ???




In the community there is some confusion about Z Girls and Z Boys and if we should continue to allow them to be posted here. Theyre by a Korean company, and trained like Kpop stars, yet, outside of that, they are not Kpop, and they cannot perform on Kpop idol shows. What are the communities feelings on these particular idols and allowing them to continue to be shared here?

State of the /r/kpop Subreddit: August 2019 Town Hall


[Welcome](https://i.imgur.com/YiGK5g2.png) to the /r/kpop Town Hall, the State of the Subreddit, July 2019 edition!

# Agenda

1. Census 2019 Reminder,  Introducing New Mods, How to give meta feedback/complaints
2. Feedback requested for various posting guidelines
3. Reassess VLOG title formatting
4. Future Projects we are working on (completely optional idea could do something else here)

---

## Census 2019 Reminder / Introducing New Mods / How to give meta feedback/complaints

(reminder to take the census and update users on the status of the redirection issue if we have new info)

(Introduce the new moderators: Conceptizual, PoohBae, Shpxl, Iblaka, ElegantShitwad, Raymondliang, BB_GG)



New Moderators:

Some of you may have noticed that we have several new faces in our moderation team, and we have mentioned it but wed like to formally mention it!

Please give a warm welcome to the *seven* new mods we have added to the /r/kpop team: /u/BB_GG, /u/raymondliang, /u/ElegantShitwad /u/Iblaka, /u/shpxl, /u/PoohBae and /u/Conceptizual! 

Please show our new mods kindness and understanding as they settle into their new roles. Theres a lot of different rules and understanding that come with running /r/kpop, and it can take a bit to learn all of the ins and outs. Additionally, our last batch of 5 moderators who were recently promoted from Junior Mods, only joined us 5 months ago, so showing those mods kindness as well should anything come up would be greatly appreciated! Were so lucky to have had 12 wonderful people join our team in the past few months to suit our growing subreddit considering we were operating with a skeleton crew for a bit there.





(addressing users tagging mods in comments, derailing, using modmail and town hall for meta feedback)


Proper channels for feedback:
On occasion a user will have a question about why a post was removed. As we just mentioned, we have added 12 moderators in the past 5 months and we have usually 16-19 active moderators at any given time. (Sometimes more if our less active but on the roster mods appear.) 

The best way to ask about why something is removed is through mod mail, that way we can ask the mod who did remove it what happened, if we have any questions, or if theres additional circumstances. (It was really a repost, theres extra info, we didnt see that it was a bad source, they had asked someone to submit a certain way, and so on into infinity of additional information.)

When users come into other threads to derail them and complain by asking why their threads were removed, its unfair to the OP, and the users enjoying the threads. We ask that you dont disrespect them by doing this.. Its also impossible for the random mods who are /u/tagged into such conversation because they might not have been around for your post removal and may have just opened the mobile app while out doing other things. Similarly, if a mod doesnt get /u/tagged, we often only find out about this chain series of complaints due to reports after they have gone on for some time.  Your comments will be removed and you will be told to take it to mod mail. 

In a similar vein, meta feedback such as large complaints, is best given in Town Hall or Mod Mails. We dont allow meta posts, because then the sub would be overrun with meta complaints and ideas, and it would no longer be about Kpop but instead a sub about how people think /r/Kpop should be run. 

Lastly stuff like the #/subreddit-discussion channel on the .kpop Discord is really only there for a quick question, answer situation, not for large scale meta feedback or the like. We may have a future solution to a more live chat feedback situation, but were a bit far off from it still.

## Feedback requested for various posting guidelines (hopefully implementing in the September Town Hall)


Music Show Wins
- Requirements at the time of posting (if not met, will be removed): 
  - Title: (Artist Name)... first win (Song Title) on (Music Show Name) (date aired)
              Examples: OH MY GIRL have taken first win for 'BUNGEE (Fall in Love)' on SBS MTV The Show (190813)
                        EXO-SC ""What a life"" earns first win on KBS Music Bank (190802)
                        ATEEZ earns first win with ""WAVE"" today on Mnet M! Countdown (190620)

- Results/wins announcement posts (all in a single post or allow each artist to have their own?)
- Performances (all allowed?)
-Treat the same as all other award shows since Kpop artists are there now so frequently?

Tour Review Round-Up
(Dravvie, feel free to add stuff here if youd like)


We have noticed that people have really enjoyed hearing about Kpop concert reviews, so we wanted to provide a format that allows users to hear about the end of a concert tour in a fun way, similar to an album review two weeks later.

We came up with a round up that enables users to share as much, or as little from a tour in a single post.

We made up a mock one with just some fun suggestions but not everything people need to include in one. (But everything you could if you wanted!)

We are uncertain if users would enjoy these roundups at the end of a tour leg, such as the end of a dome tour, SEA tour, or US tour, or at the end of an overall tour instead. It would be wonderful if people could provide us with feedback on this so we can best figure out how to utilize this new feature for the sub.

## Reassess VLOG title formatting

During the June Town Hall, we introduced the `[VLOG]` flair. However, we forgot to provide Title Formatting Rules for those type of submissions.

`Artist - VLOG Title (Date) [RAW/ENG SUB]`

EXAMPLES:

[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c8izi0/clc_sorn_my_trip_to_thailand_part_1_produsorn/): `CLC Sorn - My Trip to Thailand (Part 1) @ PRODUSORN (190703) [ENG SUB]`

CORRECT: `[CLC Sorn - My Trip to Thailand (Part 1) (190703) [ENG SUB]]`

[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c8mpy7/baekhyuns_vlog_selfteasermv_filming_studiosolo/): `Baekhyun's VLOG (Self-Teaser/MV filming studio/Solo Album)`

CORRECT: `EXO Baekhyun - Self-Teaser/MV filming studio/Solo Album (190703) [RAW]`

A reminder we have a title formatting guide when it comes to submissions for the subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_section_v_-_title_formatting_guide). Do not auto-fill the submission title. If you are submitting news, always use the title of the article you are submitting. Dates are always in YYMMDD in parenthesis. The date should never be at the beginning of the submission title.

## Future Projects

- Audio post guidelines  (singles, singular/random releases)
- Award Show/Festival season and/or western award shows: Guidelines, formatting
- Big visuals post: Community Awards, post thumbnails, User flairs, Snoos, etc.
- Giant Charts &amp; Achievements feedback/discussion post
- New Discord
- Defining fluff (news articles about nothing or info taken from variety show clips)
- Spotlight Post reminder
- Community Awards (all the new visuals)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning a gift for my friend's birthday, and I was thinking of making her a collage of all her faves. I myself am not so familiar with the groups she listens to, and I don't want to accidentally include pictures of the wrong people just because I don't recognise them. I'm looking for group pictures and individual pictures of the idols.

The list I currently have is:

* BIGBANG (G-Dragon and T.O.P.)
* iKON (B.I and Ju-ne)
* BTS (j-hope)
* EXO (Chanyeol and D.O.)
* SHINee (Jonghyun)

I'd also like to point out that she does like more groups, she just hasn't had the time to list them all. I'll update along the way :) Also, she doesn't dislike the other members in the groups above, the names listed above are just her biases so don't feel offended if yours isn't in the list, she doesn't hate anyone \^\^

Thanks to everyone who wants to help me out here  and if you want to share any music of your faves with me, I'd be glad to listen to it!

Entrance from Stray Kids Cl 1 is amazing to me. It features calls to Miroh in such subtle ways, with the slight growl, the bird cry, and some of the other parts, it has French, and it has all sorts of cool little lines from the members. I can never skip it! 

Road Not Taken from Cl 2 is also really great. From the moment it starts it just builds the hype. Theres a good beat drop, some cool lines, and its just an awesome.

Honestly Stray Kids overall has some amazing intros, but I also want to talk about Blue Side from J-Hopes Hope World. This outro has such a chill sound that always gives off calming vibes.

AB6IX = Did not know much about them but their first song was so good! The Shining Star one was great. But the Welcome to My Hollywood song fucking slapped though! I recognize Dawhi from Wanna One and wish I got into this group more before. They are dope. 

ATEEZ = Very Good cover was on point! The Hakuna Matata song had everyone into it. Really loud cheers for them. Their white outfits were also super cool. I like how they used the stage to its fullest. 

IZ*ONE = Chaewon and Yuris special duet was so good. Their vocals literally soared. The high notes had me shook. Their actual set was insane. I kinda knew what to expect but still! Violeta, Highlight, La Vie En Rose, Airplane and of course Nekkoya. I was going fucking crazy during Nekkoya lol. Such feels after following Produce 48. Ill go into detail in a fan account later. 

LOONA = Omfg that Not Today cover was fire!!! Holy I am still in shock. I was expecting Fire instead. They performed Butterfly with the intro, then random play dance with Fire, Cherry Bomb and Thanks! I loved it. Hi High was my favorite. At the end JinSoul came to my side. My bias was so close T_T Ill go into detail and provide pics/vids in my fan account later. 

MOMOLAND = Ahhhh all of them are so pretty. Even though I missed Yeonwoo, Daisy and Taeha, the rest did awesome. They performed Im So Hot, BAAM and Bboom Bboom so no surprises there but it was always good fun no matter how many times I see those performances. Nancy came to my side for the ending of Bboom Bboom and I died. 

NUEST = Hype af and great closers. Deja Vu was great with all 5 members. Nice to see them complete again. Dont know their songs but I enjoyed their set! 

SF9 = RPM is such a good song. What to say to start out. Their blindfold mission was hilarious. Their song (Jealous?) was a bop for sure. I recognize that one guy who was on Everybodys Kitchen with Sakura and HoDong. Forgot his name though lol. 

Overall the entire night was lit af and I cant wait for tomorrow as well. GA floor is worth it every time.",47,90,False,self,,,,,

And some are wild to find out.

For me, I joined K-pop community in 2013 and the most baffling K-pop news that I found out later on was... Fans hackling it up because they found Changmin was on a date from the reflection on Victoria's spoon

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cp1bnc/nugu_roundup_6_the_fantasy_youve_been_looking_for/).  While I've been doing the big feature on recent comebacks for the past few weeks, I decided to take it back to a more under-the-radar group this week, let's learn about Six Bomb!

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

**Six Bomb**

**Who are they?:**  Six Bomb is a (currently) three member girl group currently under World Event Agency (previously under Jang Entertainment and Pacemaker Entertainment).  They originally debuted as a five member group in 2012 (planned as six, but a member had an injury pre-debut and was unable to participate), quickly disbanded, redebuted in 2015 as a five member group, and have gone through various membership changes in the intervening years.

   * Formerly a member of ZZBest under the name DaYoung
* I Sol (also known as LeeSol)
   * Position: Vocalist

**Most Recent Comeback:** November 8th, 2018 with Your Neighborhood ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RuQtAZnvJU)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HokrvMnyzh0))

It became known as the 'pink sausage' concept
* Getting Prettier (Before) ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ7z96kOIUo)) the first of a two-video series that gained them some attention.  A plastic surgery concept, this is the 'before' video.

**Trivia:**  Though they received some public backlash for their plastic surgery concept, the members have mentioned that they're all quite happy with the results and feel more beautiful, and would make the same decision again.  The reported bill for all of the members surgery was over $89,000 USD.  Their most recent comeback was delayed after member Gabin had to leave the group after developing a rare bone disease that made it impossible for her to dance.  There have been nine former members of the group over the years.

With me Im not necessarily against it, but I feel like sometimes it limits the idol. 

Especially if your given the role as visual. All that means is that you fit Korean beauty standards, it says nothing about their talent.

A few I can think of right now are:

1. Twice - Like Ooh Ah (2015)
2. Seventeen - Adore U (2015)
3. AB6IX - Breathe (2019)
4. ITZY - Dalla Dalla (2019)
5. TXT - Crown (2019)

For some reason I can't think of any from 2016-2018 but would love to hear your thoughts on those years!",104,67,False,self,,,,,

Sorry this is so late, I really tried hard to come up with a theme for the longest time and didn't have a creative breakthrough until 2 hours ago  but I hope you enjoy this week's songs!

Did you suddenly cutscene to a black and white scene in the rain? Are you suddenly bopping your head to a summer beat alongside YooA's vocals? Did you suddenly remember what Lim Kim's voice sounds like? Or do you know better than you thought you did? Here are this week's songs for this week's special theme! (can you guess what it is?)

1. [IU - BBIBBI ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNAhwAv_0JY)
2. [Oh My Girl - Bungee (Fall In Love)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTnWMlYfxhw)
3. [BTS - Epiphany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc9r_BrkLmg)

Will you get hooked this week? As always, this week there are seven songs up to review on Jukebox. Listen to the song(s) you want to review and then leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song(s) in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song does not make you move, and 10 being this song is something you immediately fell in love with! As a special exception, this week __you may use the MVs for all the songs to inform your overall score for each of them__  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

You can keep reviewing songs until this Saturday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your reviews and comments in by then!

I started branching out into other hits and am now an avid kpop listener. As someone new to this, I wanted to know what other fans like and dislike about kpop.

The thing I like the most about kpop is the dance. That's what sets it apart from other music industries. Dancing significantly makes a performance strenuous but, if executed right can look awesome. I think the popularity kpop has had over other music industries is due to it's incredible vocal and choreo blends.

The thing I hate about kpop is the unfair treatment kpop idols receive as a celebrity. They are overworked and put under heavy restrictions by companies, always under a camera (I would love to get to know their personal life but, cameras in their dorms and wherever they go? I think that's just too much), have to handle to a maniac fanbase (Seriously, kpop fans are just too much. You don't own them. Grow up and act like an adult) and most of them can't even make their own music.",37,19,False,self,,,,,

Fromis_9 = Ahhhhhh! I was happy to see them last year and Im glad they came back this year. Especially cause my bias Gyuri is here this time. All of the girls are seriously so pretty. And the outfits were so cute!!!! Fun was quite literally super fun haha. The perfect summer song. The Love Bomb remix was a nice change of pace, even though I love the original. Will provide pics/vids later. 

ITZY = Omg omg omg. My goodness they were so beautiful, so pretty. Their choreo was precise. The performed Icy, Itz Summer and Dalla Dalla. Yeji is my bias and seeing her in person is so surreal. She is drop dead gorgeous. All of the girls speaking English was of course adorable.  Dalla Dalla was so hype. Ill definitely have more pics and vids to provide in my fan account. But Im hella sad they didnt come out at the end 

MAMAMOO = Im sad Wheein wasnt here and with a group with few members, even one person missing is a huge loss. Regardless the rest of the girls still did amazing. Solars special stage wow. She looked like a true queen. Love her voice. Their outfits though my goodness. Hwasa in that highlighter green, damn. Their stage presence and charisma is off the charts. Each member got so many cheers it made me happy haha. Gogobebe was SO good. 

N.FLYING = Gogobebe, Dalla Dalla rock cover on point and their collab with Stray Kids was awesome. Their actual set was such a good breakaway and stood out from the rest of the artists. Queen cover was sick! Turned the whole place around into a rock concert. 

SEVENTEEN = Their special performance, damn. So aesthetic if that makes sense haha. Their dancing is insane. Seeing the choreo in person is always amazing. They definitely worked the crowd. Wasnt familiar with Good To Me but that song was a bop and half. Nice to see them perform Clap. Still disappointed I havent seen Thanks or Dont wanna cry live yet but still enjoyed their set. Very Nice with the fake endings was the best haha. 

Stray Kids = Holy shit they started the concert on fire with that cover! Their collab with N. flying was so cool too. But holy shit that song they have with the psytrance chorus is seriously fire. Their songs feel heavy EDM-based. Not sure why I havent really gotten into them yet lol. They are such good performers. They used the stage to its fullest. It seemed like the whole crowd was there for them haha. 

VERIVERY = Catchy songs. The Tag one in particular caught my eye. They reminded me of another group but I cant quite pinpoint haha.",28,79,False,self,,,,,

It seems as though groups (KARD, Ateez, TXT, Loona ect) are starting to venture into the US before having any kind of strong fanbase, and growing from there. I understand how saturated the market is now and Korean fans tend to stan/support one group (or at most one male and one female group) so there's less room for new comers, maybe that and the timing of how well KPOP is doing internationally is why companies are sending their rookie groups out to the US? Also I was just wondering how it would affect the groups longevity, charting and chances of say winning (rookie mainly) at award shows. Thoughts?",16,23,False,self,,,,,

Full disclosure they are my ultimate bias group, but I love the diamond on top (probably the reason I love SHINee's and Monsta X. Although Seventeen's lightstick version 2 looks so much nicer (I love the mermaid scale and the dome the diamond is in), I love the basic look of the original model. It allowed fans to decorate it to their heart's content. I also love the lollipop look of Twice's original Candy Bong as well. Got7's version 2 design of their light stick is great as well. I love how they incorporated the baby bird from their fandom into the lightstick.

I'm also a huge NCT fan, but I don't like their lightstick design. The NCT electric plug design is unique, but I personally would have went in a different direction. Lots of Nctzen also echo the same sentiment. I recently got into Stray Kids as well and have mixed feelings regarding their lightstick. I was underwhelmed by the fan design. There were plenty of fan concepts that I thought goes even better with Stray Kids.

Not consecutively, but within 1.5 years, I had 52 posts. I averaged about 3-4 request per posts, so thats at least a 100 songs/videos.  Here some things I've learned.

**There is surprisingly lot of request.** Despite so many songs are translated by fans, forum, friends, blogs or almighty youtube algorithm, there are so many people who request songs that has no translation anywhere. I was a bit sadden by this fact that some people are not able to enjoy the song to its fullest potential. It got me going during my slump times to keep up with translation.   
**People really don't bother to read the rules.** Every post has same guild lines, but people seem to not care or can't bother to check. = ( They ask for a ""can you translate group X 's song A??? "" and I literally google ""Group X""s song A english subtitle"" and the first link is the English subtitles. I""m like ..""Bruh? do you even know what google is?""

  
**My knowledge of kpop is garbage.** Because I followed kpop since the 90s, I thought I knew most of the songs that people might request. But I was shocked that at least 80% of the songs are not something I've heard before. Even more surprisingly, i didn't know about the group that sings the song. I was shocked how many good bands are out there that are not getting enough love.  It is a pretty humbling experiencing.

**Why I do this?**  
\- despite being Korean,  i didn't really listen to korean music. But on a random coincidence, my friend lent me her ipod so i can listen to her korean music.  And i guess....I kept up with it ever since.  I can safely say that kpop has been with me longer than any other thing I had as my interests. It has gotten me through good times and bad times.  And i guess.... I see it as only natural to share something that I deeply care about with others.  Perhaps I can be that ""random coincidence"" in someone else's life that spark them to take interest in kpop. 

well....i guess I'll keep on truckin. Thanks for reading. See you guys next week for more translation request = P

My current ultimate bias is Yuju (GFRIEND).

There are so many reasons why I chose her to be my ult. She basically radiates talent. She can sing, dance, rap. Shes absolutely stunning. Her personality (extra, dorky, alien-like in a good way, etc.) is very attractive to me and is something my other biases dont usually which makes her really cute. Yuju is beautiful, inside and out. &lt;3

So as the title suggests this fan account is going to be girl group focused regarding my time at KCONLA this past weekend. Specifically MOMOLAND, LOONA, IZONE, ITZY, FROMIS_9 and MAMAMOO. Though I truly enjoyed all of the boy groups that performed, my main motivation on going this year was the stacked girl group lineup (even without Everglow, Chungha, Wheein and 3 members of MOMOLAND T_T). Regardless, if you want to read some of my thoughts regarding the boy groups check out my reaction threads from [Day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/crxktm/kconla_day_1_reaction_thread/) and [Day 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cscpvx/kconla_day_2_reaction_thread/) respectively. Even though I added my thoughts on all the girl groups I am about to write about there, I wanted to further elaborate with pictures, videos as well as provide my experience at the actual convention. This turned out WAY WAYYY longer than I expected and I didn't realize how hard it was to get this altogether so if even one person reads this fan account all the way through it will have been worth it. I really don't expect it though haha. If you are interested in just one group, scroll down to the **BOLD** section of the group. 

So to begin, I already was expecting to go to KCONLA before the lineup was even announced. I thought about going to KCONNY but I held off since they said LA would be bigger and better. I had my suspicion that IZONE was going to be going to both since they were a Produce/MNET group and in previous years IOI and Wanna One did both as well. So once IZONE was announced, I was already determined to go. However once they announced LOONA was going as well, there was never a question about it. LOONA has been my #1 GG ever since they debuted in sub-units and each girl was revealed. So the chance to see them live and in person was something I couldn't pass up. If you can tell by my flair, over half of my biases were going to KCONLA and so I had no choice but to go lol.

When tickets were released, I was lucky enough to get GA Floor (though it definitely wasn't super packed like I expected it to be). After that, it was just a matter of booking flights, housing and all the other logistics, since I was flying in from Austin, Texas. I was pretty disappointed when they announced the lineup for KCON Rookies featuring LOONA since I totally would have gone! However it was too late for me to change my flights/housing since I was flying in that Friday night after work. And thus, I missed out. Though I did hear that the girls did amazing and that Orbits were loud and proud which makes me happy. Not only that but the airport videos were awesome as well. I do hope LOONA knows now how well-loved they are by the international community, especially in the US. 

**DAY 1**

I got to the Convention Center Saturday morning around 11am and went to go get my GA wristband (though this system didn't really matter in the end for me, I will explain later). After that I checked into the convention and went inside. At first I did a lap around the convention seeing where everything was. I ended up buying all of my merch (posters, clothing and albums) since I didn't want things to sell out and what not. 

Just as a fair warning, the pictures and videos I am adding here aren't the best quality but just know I did my best. It was all taken using an iPhone XS. So excuse the shakiness, blurriness, the length, screaming/shouting in the background, etc. But hopefully it makes you feel like you were there haha. Also I embedded links into the text so be sure to open links that are attached.

I don't know where I heard it from, be it Twitter or somewhere but there were rumors LOONA was going to show up at the Chips Ahoy booth so I headed there. And there was already a HUGE crowd waiting. Full of Orbits as I could tell since everyone was wearing LOONA merch or holding the slogans. We waited and eventually they came out! I was kinda far back and am a short person sadly so my view wasn't the greatest. But there were times when there were no phones being held up and I could see the girls and WOW. I knew they were pretty but wtf they were seriously TOO PRETTY. Especially the blonde girls, JinSoul and Go Won. But all of them were looking amazing. Here are some low quality pictures (since I had to zoom and struggle for a good angle) I took: 

* [Photo 1](https://i.imgur.com/XOPAL17.jpg) | [Photo 2](https://i.imgur.com/HR8crEc.jpg) | [Photo 3](https://i.imgur.com/RyTg6Cw.jpg). 

And here is a [video of just the girls featuring Heejin English](https://streamable.com/tk0vk). Even though I could barely see or hear them it was nice just being in their presence lmfao. After they ended, they walked to the K-Beauty stage. It was really quick but I got a [short video of them walking. Including me saying Happy Birthday HaSeul lol](https://streamable.com/axj8l). I know a lot of Orbits knew they were doing the K-Beauty stage so many people were already camped out. And wow was that area packed to the brim! It was insane.

After this, I checked out some other panels before going to the LOONA fanclub meeting. Now that was fun! The whole room was seriously super packed and the hosts did a great job. Since there was so many people there, I couldn't get any signal to play the quiz game. But I ended up helping the two people next to me. And I realized I am truly complete LOONA trash since I got every answer right lol. We practiced the fan chants which was fun (even though I totally forgot them during the concert but it's okay). And then the random play dance was AMAZING. Shoutout to everyone who participated in that, you all slayed!!! After the fan club meeting ended, I just hung outside, ate at the food trucks (Bulgogi bowls noms) and then got in line for the GA. Now I mentioned before about the wristbands. So I was number #600 something and couldn't find where to go. So I ended up just waiting in line until the non-wristband GA people started going in and went with them. Went inside and got more wristbands (for GA, the lightup ones, etc.) and headed inside. The floor of GA was not that packed surprisingly though the side with diamond/platinum and the cameras had limited space compared to the other side. Regardless me and some friends I made found a relatively good spot. I will mention here that when any of the girls perform toward one side and then switch to the other side, us 3 would walk/run to also switch sides so we were never really facing their backs and always had a front view. 

Eventually the concert started and LOONA was featured in the crowd notices! 

* [Example 1](https://streamable.com/8w8p0) 

* [Example 2](https://streamable.com/xijo9)

LOONA ended up coming out near the beginning with [a cover of BTS Not Today!](https://streamable.com/cy3fy) It was seriously so damn good and caught me off guard since this was a new cover they haven't done before. [Here is another video](https://streamable.com/83nmi) and some pictures. [One](https://i.imgur.com/jaP1Xwk.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/KAJ28EI.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/DISto5Z.jpg). 

Chaewon and Yuri then came out for a special duet!!! I don't know the name of the song they sang [but it was amazing!](https://streamable.com/ree0v) 
Another [video](https://streamable.com/p1duk). 

**MOMOLAND**

MOMOLAND then came out and started with I'm So Hot. First things first, I was already sad that Daisy and Taeha was missing and then I found Yeonwoo was missing as well T_T Sad life but I understand the show must go on and the rest of the girls did their best regardless of the circumstances. It was nice seeing Nayun though since she wasn't at last year's KCONLA. They were all so pretty but since Nancy is my bias, of course I was watching her most of the time. 

* Here are a couple of pictures: [One](https://i.imgur.com/WIXqkaH.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/RgLvcOB.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/IppHOnu.jpg). 

* Videos: [One](https://streamable.com/mgnc4) | [Two](https://streamable.com/h4crd) | [Three](https://streamable.com/vvgta)

Wasn't the biggest fan of I'm So Hot when it came out but seeing it live was nice and exciting. Especially since I knew to expect the next two songs but regardless it was still awesome!

Next up they did BAAM. 

* [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/NgiG6m5.jpg) and videos: [One](https://streamable.com/br75g) | [Two](https://streamable.com/ziauq)

One of the things I noticed was they were shuffling in high heels. Much respect to them haha. 

They then switched sides and ended with BBoom Bboom. Of course I have heard this song 1000x and watched live performances/fancams even more but it never gets old. 

* [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/1IBPCqG.jpg) 

* [Video of the chorus](https://streamable.com/b6sdl). 

Now the reason I absolutely died during this song was because [my bias Nancy came to my side](https://i.imgur.com/DYl2vY4.jpg) and danced [the end so close to me =O](https://streamable.com/cerya) I can't get over how pretty she was, it's seriously insane. It definitely confirmed her as my bias and I am lucky she ended up going over to my side. 

**LOONA**

Next was LOONA!!!! During the Butterfly intro Heejin and JinSoul came out of the side closest to me. 

* Pictures: [One](https://i.imgur.com/Fz7P6v9.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/N0EX1cf.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/XmHSYl7.jpg). 

* And here is [the video of the intro](https://streamable.com/ywl56).

Since LOONA has 12 members I loved how they used up the whole stage at the beginning. Taking advantage of the large number. It goes without saying and this applies to every girl idol but they are seriously so much prettier in person. Videos/pictures and everything else do not do them justice at all. Not only that but I never realized how precise and in-sync their choreo is until seeing them live. Like WOWOWOWOWOW. 

* [Video of the First Verse including Go Won's lift](https://streamable.com/puo60)

* [Second Verse ](https://streamable.com/polzi)

* [Song ending and pose](https://streamable.com/wrzdg) | [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/i704NOE.jpg)

The thing I noticed the most however regarding the choreo is that they work SO well as a team. There aren't any clear deficiencies between the group members, everyone's dancing so well. Not only that but the changing formations and moving parts are like art. It really is beautiful. The butterfly theme is seen throughout and seeing it like that in person made me appreciate it so much more. I loved it so much. 

After Butterfly, they stopped to introduce themselves and do random play dance with boy group songs. This entire section was AMAZING. 

* Here are some pictures of the group: [One](https://i.imgur.com/f2eIHMs.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/iIt10If.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/RDNhQGL.jpg) | [Four](https://i.imgur.com/3XVLhiz.jpg)

UGH all of this was so good. LOONA doing boy group choreo is seriously the best. Even though I saw these covers before seeing in person is truly different. So precise and hard-hitting. Love love love it. Was screaming super loud the entire time I wasn't recording. 

Of course they ended with Hi High. At this point they switched sides and I definitely ran the fuck over to the other side. Security had to tell me to slow down lmfao. 

* [Here is a picture during.](https://i.imgur.com/6EdGpQf.jpg)

* [First verse (feat. my terrible fanchants lol)](https://streamable.com/opchj)

* [Hi High chorus](https://streamable.com/0dh68)

First things first this song really had me in my feels. As someone who has followed LOONA since HaSeul was revealed, I have seen them grow in front of my eyes. Seeing them get more fans, more views, more popular seriously has warmed my heart. And knowing that I have supported them since almost the beginning makes seeing them as OT12 all the more rewarding. When Hi High was released, I actually did a giveaway here on this subreddit because of how much it meant to me. So I really really mean it when I say this made my life truly special and awesome. Regarding the above videos, I tried my best to do the fanchants but I just felt awkward, especially since I speak terrible Korean lol. Also during the chorus, I never noticed this before but when Heejin and Go Won meet in the middle, they usually do with their hands or hug but here they met with a kiss!!! Haha. So cute. 

And last but not the least. I died when JinSoul, my ultimate LOONA bias, came to my side for the ending. Ahhhhhhhh the iconic blonde hair (though I do want her to change it for the health of her hair). I was so so so happy. It's like fate was granting me my ultimate wish. 

* [Here is the video of her on my side including Heejin and HaSeul.](https://streamable.com/h3auw)

At this point, my night was already COMPLETELY made but we still had IZONE to go! 

**IZONE**

[Here was their video intro.](https://streamable.com/2h3x2)

They opened with Violeta. When they first appeared my jaw literally dropped, I was in awe for real. I knew they were gorgeous and beautiful but this was a whole new level. The red outfits were the perfect choice, shoutout to the stylist wherever you are.

Wow wow wow. So initially my bias was Sakura but it recently changed to Hyewon. So the entire time I was watching the whole group but tended to focus on her after a while. I know people complained about her lack of talent etc. but I didn't think anything of it. She was doing really well and did not hinder the group at all. In fact, I love how it looks like she doesn't want to be there half the time haha. It makes her even more charming. Also I need to comment I was watching the J-Line intensely as well. Seeing them in person was so awesome. Just knowing how hard they worked during PD48 and seeing them now living their K-Pop idol dreams. I hope they enjoyed performing in LA as much as I enjoyed seeing them. 

Next up was Highlight. Wowowow this choreo is so simple yet so pretty. The floor parts had me shook. 

* [Beginning of Highlight](https://streamable.com/m1t99)

* [Chorus of Highlight](https://streamable.com/cjwnh) 

So good. I am glad they got to perform this and you bet I was looking at Hyewon during the chorus when she said ""Look At Me"". 

Next was La Vie En Rose. Ugh I always thought this song was such a strong debut and seeing it live only reaffirmed that. 

* [First verse](https://streamable.com/lxgy6)

* [Second verse/Yena's rap](https://streamable.com/97e41) 
| Funny part about this video is that they switched sides mid-song and you can hear me complain about it lol. We then rushed to the other side. 

* [Bridge to last chorus](https://streamable.com/6g91m) | I always loved the formations they had during this part. Yuri's high note though!!!

Next they performed Airplane. Cutest song ever haha. 

* [Verse/Pre-Chorus](https://streamable.com/fhmtd)

* [Ending](https://streamable.com/gnzm7)

And last but certainly not least they ended with Nekkoya. I was afraid they weren't going to do it but I am thankful they actually did! Seeing as how PD48 was literally my summer last year and Nekkoya was my summer jam and still is on my daily playlist, it's a song I am truly in love with. 

* [Nekkoya Chorus](https://streamable.com/sykt1)

* [Yuri center during bridge and ending](https://streamable.com/98gvd) 

Ahhhhh you need to watch the 2nd video because Yujin and Wonyoung ended up coming over to our side! And man I knew they were pretty but wow. I understand now why they made it into the group. Their talent and fan service was on full display. I'll admit I was biased during PD48 but that's long gone. I was so happy they were right there. Wonyoung's hair especially is so pretty and shiny like wtf. 

After they finished they left and [I caught a couple of them going backstage!!!](https://streamable.com/joxwt). Also here are some more pictures of them, I forgot during which songs they were taken haha.

**ENDING**

At the very end of the concert I was truly blessed by both IZONE, LOONA and MOMOLAND getting super close to me. Or more like getting close to them haha. 

[Here is IZONE](https://streamable.com/yocgm) 

* I was paying particular attention to Hitomi and Nako's interaction here. I wonder what they were talking about haha. So much uwuwuwuwu. And of course my OTP, Hyekura. But seriously all of the girls were drop dead gorgeous. 

[Here is LOONA and MOMOLAND](https://streamable.com/tzbg8) 

* Ugh Yves and Kim Lip's fan service was perfect. So jealous of those fans. Also Nancy was such a delight. I love everything about her. Again, all of the girls looked amazing.  

[Official ending with LOONA](https://streamable.com/28x8f)

* My baby Chuu is seriously the best. I love how she picked up the confetti and tossed them haha. MUST PROTECT AT ALL COSTS. It made me happy she got arguably the loudest cheers of all the girls in LOONA throughout the night. 

After the night ended, I drove about 45 minutes south and was buzzing the entire time. I couldn't believe what I just witnessed and I really did have the time of my life.  

**DAY 2**

The next day I got to the convention in time for the ITZY fan club meetup. It wasn't as busy as LOONA's but it was still a lot of fun! I actually got 3rd place in the bingo game (yay me) and it was cool seeing more ITZY fans. We practiced the fanchant guides and actually got some cool banners to hold. When that ended, me and my friend went into the convention and saw a huge crowd. Next thing I know we actually ran into Fromis_9! And they were doing a relay dance and then later a selfie video!

* [Relay dance of Love Bomb](https://streamable.com/vxpi6)

* [Selfie video of Fun](https://streamable.com/a67oh)

* [Group picture](https://i.imgur.com/GmtqyUl.jpg)

As you can tell from the videos it was super crowded and I didn't have the best angle to see them but still it was cool. After that ended they went to the K-Beauty stage like LOONA did the day before. The front was already crowded so we decided to try and be smart and just hang out near the side where they enter. And boy was that totally worth it!

* [fromis_9 entrance](https://streamable.com/1zzie)

As you can see from the angle we basically couldn't hear or see anything they were talking about lol. [I did appreciate how the banners next to the stage had the 4 main reasons I came to KCONLA haha.](https://i.imgur.com/RFHlGfj.jpg) Eventually their interview ended and they exited. 

* [fromis_9 exit](https://streamable.com/bx3ow)

* [Just Gyuri being an angel](https://streamable.com/pp92e)

I didn't have a fromis_9 bias until I watched PD48 and fell in love with Gyuri. Now she's my bias and I died when she got that close. She's insanely pretty (I know I keep saying this) but it's true. 

After this ended, we just chilled around for a bit in the convention. Next thing we know, there is a huge crowd lining up for something. Didn't know what for but lined up anyways. Waited there for 30 minutes and MAMAMOO showed up! Super brief though as seen in below video lol. 

* [Mamamoo walking](https://streamable.com/ctfey)

Ugh they all looked so good. After this we ended up finding the wall with the signatures. And [I love how LOONA's was signed!!!](https://i.imgur.com/SxWxqRO.jpg). Everyone's signature was so pretty. My friend had a ITZY audience for their artist engagement so I thought fuck it, I need to get one too haha. So I ended up buying one for $25 lol. God bless Twitter. We headed over there and waited until we were let in. Now I didn't really start stanning ITZY until this latest comeback with Icy but I truly fell in love with this group. Their combination of fierce and cute is amazing. The artist engagement was low-key kind of crazy but I thought it was relatively worth it. 

* [Some introductions including Yuna as Hussey](https://streamable.com/gjjpl)

As you can tell my angle is terrible and being short and in the back in the audience really didnt help lol. They ended up playing a game where they spin in circles and then take a selfie. I wasn't able to record Yuna's selfie part but I got the beginning. I did get Yeji's (my bias &lt;3) though. 

* [Chaeryeong chanting ""Go Hussey""](https://streamable.com/wfjl8)

* [Yeji spin and selfie taking](https://streamable.com/fni9h)

* [Yeji's actual selfie](https://streamable.com/b47o7)

Yeji's team ending up winning and she was so happy she won cookies lol. 

* [Yeji English ""I like cookie""](https://streamable.com/kh95o)

After this they [started the hi-touch](https://streamable.com/i53ko). Was super jealous of everyone who got that lucky lol. Once that ended, my friend and I left to chill outside. He ended up going to Red Carpet and I just chilled in front of the convention center till it was done. Ended up meeting some cool people outside who were into TWICE and LOONA like I was haha. Eventually my friend came back and we went to go eat at the food trucks before the concert. As I mentioned before, the GA floor wasn't full at all so we were NO rush to go in this time. We went in about 20 minutes before it was supposed to start. Went through the same drill and got a spot. The side with the cameras/Diamond/Platinum was way more full today. Definitely all the SEVENTEEN fans haha. 

**ITZY**

The first GG up was ITZY!!! Started off with Icy. Was absolutely in love with their outfits. Yeji my bias looked stunning and I always love when she has her hair down. All the other girls were gorgeous as well. 

* [Beginning of Icy](https://streamable.com/xr973)

* [Icy Pre-Chorus/Some chorus](https://streamable.com/sjylc)

* [Icy Ending](https://streamable.com/5cmd8)

The choreo was on point. I loved their energy and the hairflips. They have it down to a science haha. 

They then did their intros (which I sadly didn't record). But I did get [more English for Yeji XD](https://streamable.com/xqvq3)

Yeji, Ryujin and Chaeryeong then did a cover of Hard Carry and WOW was that amazing. Featuring Lia and Yuna being cute in the back. 

* [Hard Carry](https://streamable.com/0wcnj)

They then did It'z Summer, one of my favorite B-Sides this year. No doubt a bop. 

* [It'z summer verse (I think lol)](https://streamable.com/a0gag)

* [It'z summer chorus](https://streamable.com/z6miy)

They then ended with Dalla Dalla. They switched sides so we definitely ran to the other side lol. 

* [Dalla Dalla pre-chorus](https://streamable.com/6nd6u)

* [Yeji's ""My Life"" killing part](https://streamable.com/n3g1s)

* [Dalla Dalla Chorus](https://streamable.com/ehzml)

* [Dalla Dalla dance break/bridge](https://streamable.com/udth2)

* [Dalla Dalla ending](https://streamable.com/xdfm0)

Where do I even begin with this song. Seriously lit af. I always thought the song was cool but never really got into it until I started stanning ITZY. Yeji's killing part is always my favorite. The floor move and hairflips are iconic. The crowd was super into it at this point for sure. Wish they could have kept going but alas their set ended. 

Here are some pictures that I took, don't remember during which songs either haha:

* [One](https://i.imgur.com/Cu6hPk3.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/VHCGNai.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/nw4uAVC.jpg) | [Four](https://i.imgur.com/YtHPNX3.jpg) | [Five](https://i.imgur.com/spUi7vy.jpg)

Solar had a special stage next but I will put that under the MAMAMOO section. 

**FROMIS_9**

Half of the girls, including Gyuri, started on my side for the Fun intro. Surprised the hell out of me. But once again, I got blessed with my bias. While the intro was great, I love the actual song. It was so cheerful and bubbly of course, perfect summer song. 

* [Fun intro](https://streamable.com/lumpk)

* [Fun chorus](https://streamable.com/fvgvh)

* [Another Fun chorus](https://streamable.com/lvw5p)

Again it goes without saying they are all so pretty. And I love seeing them complete as OT9 now that Gyuri is back, compared to last year. 

Next they did Love Rumpumpum. Such a good B-side/double title track. Glad they ended up promoting it for a bit. 

* [Chorus](https://streamable.com/ok7w7)

After this they did Love Bomb but a remix version. I am not going to lie and say I loved it since I love the original so much but I did enjoy the difference as best I could. I was still singing and having a great time regardless. 

* [Love Bomb chorus](https://streamable.com/jdgls)

* [Love Bomb bridge](https://streamable.com/e90aj)

The choreo was always fantastic and the girls did great. I thoroughly enjoyed them more this year compared to last as weird as that sounds. Even though last year they did DKDK and To Heart haha. 

Some pictures of fromis_9 that I took:

* [One](https://i.imgur.com/CBWGkPr.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/DbS2osq.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/3eeHitF.jpg) | [Four](https://i.imgur.com/MtVNpLR.jpg) | [Five](https://i.imgur.com/7FhmK1M.jpg) | [Six](https://i.imgur.com/8vtTrH4.jpg)

**MAMAMOO**

Last but not least, Mamamoo. Preface, of course I was really sad that Wheein was unable to make it. But regardless, the girls still did extremely well and I was happy to see them. First earlier in the night, Solar had a special solo stage performing a song from Aladdin? I think aha. That's what someone told me. My main takeaway from it was how pretty she looked. Like a true ice princess. 

* [Solar solo](https://streamable.com/hxnor)

All of MAMAMOO's vocals are insane but I love hearing Solar's for sure. She did a great job. 

Their actual set started with Starry Night. A lovely song. Loved all of the cheers Moonbyul received whenever she started rapping. Not to mention their outfits for the night were hot af. Hwasa in that highlighter green but rocking it for sure haha. 

* [Starry Night](https://streamable.com/ehffg)

Then they did Egotistic. Such a good song. I always loved the chorus. Their stage presence is also so good. Their charisma is undeniable, especially Hwasa. And Solar's adlibs are so damn good here. 

* [Egotistic verse](https://streamable.com/8dgxe)

* [Egotistic chorus](https://streamable.com/1635v) 

Next was Decalcomanie. At this point they split up and started using the full stage. Solar and Hwasa both came to my side so the vids are focused on them. 

* [Solar](https://streamable.com/9oyv2)

* [Hwasa](https://streamable.com/yjdw8)

So hype. Even without Wheein they knew how to work the crowd and use the stage. 

They ended with Gogobebe, probably my favorite MAMAMOO song. 

* [First verse](https://streamable.com/3bkdc)

* [Bridge to chorus](https://streamable.com/h8pct) | Hwasa is the best and this video is the reason why haha. 

Overall they did an amazing job and even though Wheein was missed, it didn't affect their performance too much. 

Pictures of MAMAMOO: 

* [One](https://i.imgur.com/r2TchUU.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/MZmgssB.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/Ps4pxJf.jpg) 

At the end of the concert, I was excited to see ITZY again and hopefully get close. But alas they didn't come out at all T_T But I got some good video of FROMIS_9 and a bit of MAMAMOO when they came my way. 

* [FROMIS_9 ft. MAMAMOO](https://streamable.com/2wz24)

* [Saerom, Hayoung and a bit of Gyuri only](https://streamable.com/uqtp4)

That is officially it! Obviously it would have been even better if Everglow, Chungha, Wheein and all of MOMOLAND was there but still, all of the girl groups did amazing. The convention was the best it has been since I have gone and I thoroughly enjoyed every second I spent over there this past weekend. I'll cherish these memories for a long time. If anyone ever is debating whether to go to KCONLA, I hope this can somewhat convince you. It is seriously awesome, especially if you love the artists like I do. 

I'll end with some pictures of the slogans I got for LOONA and ITZY.

I know there are obvious standouts that got noticed such as Everglow and Bvndit. Also do companies not learn when there is too much saturation and too much supply but not enough demand, why risk it? Are they risking it for that possible hit and that they might be the one producing it?

So as the title suggests this fan account is going to be girl group focused regarding my time at KCONLA this past weekend. Specifically MOMOLAND, LOONA, IZONE, ITZY, FROMIS_9 and MAMAMOO. Though I truly enjoyed all of the boy groups that performed, my main motivation on going this year was the stacked girl group lineup (even without Everglow, Chungha, Wheein and 3 members of MOMOLAND T_T). Regardless, if you want to read some of my thoughts regarding the boy groups check out my reaction threads from [Day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/crxktm/kconla_day_1_reaction_thread/) and [Day 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cscpvx/kconla_day_2_reaction_thread/) respectively. Even though I added my thoughts on all the girl groups I am about to write about there, I wanted to further elaborate with pictures, videos as well as provide my experience at the actual convention. This turned out WAY WAYYY longer than I expected and I didn't realize how hard it was to get this altogether so if even one person reads this fan account all the way through it will have been worth it. I really don't expect it though haha. If you are interested in just one group, scroll down to the **BOLD** section of the group. 

So to begin, I already was expecting to go to KCONLA before the lineup was even announced. I thought about going to KCONNY but I held off since they said LA would be bigger and better. I had my suspicion that IZONE was going to both since they were a Produce/MNET group and in previous years IOI and Wanna One did both as well. So once IZONE was announced, I was already determined to go. However once they announced LOONA was going as well, there was never a question about it. LOONA has been my #1 GG ever since they debuted in sub-units and each girl was revealed. So the chance to see them live and in person was something I couldn't pass up. If you can tell by my flair, over half of my biases were going to KCONLA and so I had no choice but to go lol.

When tickets were released, I was lucky enough to get GA Floor (though it definitely wasn't super packed like I expected it to be). After that, it was just a matter of booking flights, housing and all the other logistics, since I was flying in from Austin, Texas. I was pretty disappointed when they announced the lineup for KCON Rookies featuring LOONA since I totally would have gone! However it was too late for me to change my flights/housing since I was flying in that Friday night after work. And thus, I missed out. Though I did hear that the girls did amazing and that Orbits were loud and proud which makes me happy. Not only that but the airport videos were awesome as well. I do hope LOONA knows now how well-loved they are by the international community, especially in the US. 

**DAY 1**

I got to the Convention Center Saturday morning around 11am and went to go get my GA wristband (though this system didn't really matter in the end for me, I will explain later). After that I checked into the convention and went inside. At first I did a lap around the convention seeing where everything was. I ended up buying all of my merch (posters, clothing and albums) since I didn't want things to sell out and what not. 

Just as a fair warning, the pictures and videos I am adding here aren't the best quality but just know I did my best. It was all taken using an iPhone XS. So excuse the shakiness, blurriness, the length, screaming/shouting in the background, etc. But hopefully it makes you feel like you were there haha. Also I embedded links into the text so be sure to open links that are attached.

I don't know where I heard it from, be it Twitter or somewhere but there were rumors LOONA was going to show up at the Chips Ahoy booth so I headed there. And there was already a HUGE crowd waiting. Full of Orbits as I could tell since everyone was wearing LOONA merch or holding the slogans. We waited and eventually they came out! I was kinda far back and am a short person sadly so my view wasn't the greatest. But there were times when there were no phones being held up and I could see the girls and WOW. I knew they were pretty but wtf they were seriously TOO PRETTY. Especially the blonde girls, JinSoul and Go Won. But all of them were looking amazing. Here are some low quality pictures (since I had to zoom and struggle for a good angle) I took: 

* [Photo 1](https://i.imgur.com/XOPAL17.jpg) | [Photo 2](https://i.imgur.com/HR8crEc.jpg) | [Photo 3](https://i.imgur.com/RyTg6Cw.jpg). 

And here is a [video of just the girls featuring Heejin English](https://streamable.com/tk0vk). Even though I could barely see or hear them it was nice just being in their presence lmfao. After they ended, they walked to the K-Beauty stage. It was really quick but I got a [short video of them walking. Including me saying Happy Birthday HaSeul lol](https://streamable.com/axj8l). I know a lot of Orbits knew they were doing the K-Beauty stage so many people were already camped out. And wow was that area packed to the brim! It was insane.

After this, I checked out some other panels before going to the LOONA fanclub meeting. Now that was fun! The whole room was seriously super packed and the hosts did a great job. Since there was so many people there, I couldn't get any signal to play the quiz game. But I ended up helping the two people next to me. And I realized I am truly complete LOONA trash since I got every answer right lol. We practiced the fan chants which was fun (even though I totally forgot them during the concert but it's okay). And then the random play dance was AMAZING. Shoutout to everyone who participated in that, you all slayed!!! After the fan club meeting ended, I just hung outside, ate at the food trucks (Bulgogi bowls noms) and then got in line for the GA. Now I mentioned before about the wristbands. So I was number #600 something and couldn't find where to go. So I ended up just waiting in line until the non-wristband GA people started going in and went with them. Went inside and got more wristbands (for GA, the lightup ones, etc.) and headed inside. The floor of GA was not that packed surprisingly though the side with diamond/platinum and the cameras had limited space compared to the other side. Regardless me and some friends I made found a relatively good spot. I will mention here that when any of the girls perform toward one side and then switch to the other side, us 3 would walk/run to also switch sides so we were never really facing their backs and always had a front view. 

Eventually the concert started and LOONA was featured in the crowd notices! 

* [Example 1](https://streamable.com/8w8p0) 

* [Example 2](https://streamable.com/xijo9)

LOONA ended up coming out near the beginning with [a cover of BTS Not Today!](https://streamable.com/cy3fy) It was seriously so damn good and caught me off guard since this was a new cover they haven't done before. [Here is another video](https://streamable.com/83nmi) and some pictures. [One](https://i.imgur.com/jaP1Xwk.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/KAJ28EI.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/DISto5Z.jpg). 

Chaewon and Yuri from IZONE then came out for a special duet!!! I don't know the name of the song they sang [but it was amazing!](https://streamable.com/ree0v) 
Another [video](https://streamable.com/p1duk). 

**MOMOLAND**

MOMOLAND then came out and started with I'm So Hot. First things first, I was already sad that Daisy and Taeha was missing and then I found out Yeonwoo was missing as well T_T Sad life but I understand the show must go on and the rest of the girls did their best regardless of the circumstances. It was nice seeing Nayun though since she wasn't at last year's KCONLA. They were all so pretty but since Nancy is my bias, of course I was watching her most of the time. 

* Here are a couple of pictures: [One](https://i.imgur.com/WIXqkaH.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/RgLvcOB.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/IppHOnu.jpg). 

* Videos: [One](https://streamable.com/mgnc4) | [Two](https://streamable.com/h4crd) | [Three](https://streamable.com/vvgta)

Wasn't the biggest fan of I'm So Hot when it came out but seeing it live was nice and exciting. Especially since I knew to expect the next two songs but regardless it was still awesome!

Next up they did BAAM. 

* [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/NgiG6m5.jpg) and videos: [One](https://streamable.com/br75g) | [Two](https://streamable.com/ziauq)

One of the things I noticed was they were shuffling in high heels. Much respect to them haha. 

They then switched sides and ended with BBoom Bboom. Of course I have heard this song 1000x and watched live performances/fancams even more but it never gets old. 

* [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/1IBPCqG.jpg) 

* [Video of the chorus](https://streamable.com/b6sdl). 

Now the reason I absolutely died during this song was because [my bias Nancy came to my side](https://i.imgur.com/DYl2vY4.jpg) and danced [the end so close to me =O](https://streamable.com/cerya) I can't get over how pretty she was, it's seriously insane. It definitely confirmed her as my bias and I am lucky she ended up going over to my side. 

**LOONA**

Next was LOONA!!!! During the Butterfly intro Heejin and JinSoul came out of the side closest to me. 

* Pictures: [One](https://i.imgur.com/Fz7P6v9.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/N0EX1cf.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/XmHSYl7.jpg). 

* And here is [the video of the intro](https://streamable.com/ywl56).

Since LOONA has 12 members I loved how they used up the whole stage at the beginning. Taking advantage of the large number. It goes without saying and this applies to every girl idol but they are seriously so much prettier in person. Videos/pictures and everything else do not do them justice at all. Not only that but I never realized how precise and in-sync their choreo is until seeing them live. Like WOWOWOWOWOW. 

* [Video of the First Verse including Go Won's lift](https://streamable.com/puo60)

* [The Chorus](https://streamable.com/ekmoh)

* [Second Verse ](https://streamable.com/polzi)

* [Song ending and pose](https://streamable.com/wrzdg) | [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/i704NOE.jpg)

The thing I noticed the most however regarding the choreo is that they work SO well as a team. There aren't any clear deficiencies between the group members, everyone's dancing so well. Not only that but the changing formations and moving parts are like art. It really is beautiful. The butterfly theme is seen throughout and seeing it like that in person made me appreciate it so much more. I loved it so much. 

After Butterfly, they stopped to introduce themselves and do random play dance with boy group songs. This entire section was AMAZING. 

* Here are some pictures of the group: [One](https://i.imgur.com/f2eIHMs.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/iIt10If.jpg) | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/RDNhQGL.jpg) | [Four](https://i.imgur.com/3XVLhiz.jpg)

UGH all of this was so good. LOONA doing boy group choreo is seriously the best. Even though I saw these covers before seeing in person is truly different. So precise and hard-hitting. Love love love it. Was screaming super loud the entire time I wasn't recording. 

Of course they ended with Hi High. At this point they switched sides and I definitely ran the fuck over to the other side. Security had to tell me to slow down lmfao. 

* [Here is a picture during.](https://i.imgur.com/6EdGpQf.jpg)

* [First verse (feat. my terrible fanchants lol)](https://streamable.com/opchj)

* [Hi High chorus](https://streamable.com/0dh68)

First things first this song really had me in my feels. As someone who has followed LOONA since HaSeul was revealed, I have seen them grow in front of my eyes. Seeing them get more fans, more views, more popular seriously has warmed my heart. And knowing that I have supported them since almost the beginning makes seeing them as OT12 all the more rewarding. When Hi High was released, I actually did a giveaway here on this subreddit because of how much it meant to me. So I really really mean it when I say this made my life truly special and awesome. Regarding the above videos, I tried my best to do the fanchants but I just felt awkward, especially since I speak terrible Korean lol. Also during the chorus, I never noticed this before but when Heejin and Go Won meet in the middle, they usually do with their hands or hug but here they met with a kiss!!! Haha. So cute. 

And last but not the least. I died when JinSoul, my ultimate LOONA bias, came to my side for the ending. Ahhhhhhhh the iconic blonde hair (though I do want her to change it for the health of her hair). I was so so so happy. It's like fate was granting me my ultimate wish. 

* [Here is the video of her on my side including Heejin and HaSeul.](https://streamable.com/h3auw)

At this point, my night was already COMPLETELY made but we still had IZONE to go! 

**IZONE**

[Here was their video intro.](https://streamable.com/2h3x2)

They opened with Violeta. When they first appeared my jaw literally dropped, I was in awe for real. I knew they were gorgeous and beautiful but this was a whole new level. The red outfits were the perfect choice, shoutout to the stylist wherever you are. 

* [Video of the beginning of Violeta](https://streamable.com/0vmi2)

* [Violeta ending and pose](https://streamable.com/ymqsw) | [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/uqg3mv9.jpg)

Wow wow wow. So initially my bias was Sakura but it recently changed to Hyewon. So the entire time I was watching the whole group but tended to focus on her after a while. I know people complained about her lack of talent etc. but I didn't think anything of it. She was doing really well and did not hinder the group at all. In fact, I love how it looks like she doesn't want to be there half the time haha. It makes her even more charming. Also I need to comment I was watching the J-Line intensely as well. Seeing them in person was so awesome. Just knowing how hard they worked during PD48 and seeing them now living their K-Pop idol dreams. I hope they enjoyed performing in LA as much as I enjoyed seeing them. 

Next up was Highlight. Wowowow this choreo is so simple yet so pretty. The floor parts had me shook. 

* [Beginning of Highlight](https://streamable.com/m1t99)

* [Chorus of Highlight](https://streamable.com/cjwnh) 

So good. I am glad they got to perform this and you bet I was looking at Hyewon during the chorus when she said ""Look At Me"". 

Next was La Vie En Rose. Ugh I always thought this song was such a strong debut and seeing it live only reaffirmed that. 

* [First verse](https://streamable.com/lxgy6)

* [Second verse/Yena's rap](https://streamable.com/97e41) 
| Funny part about this video is that they switched sides mid-song and you can hear me complain about it lol. We then rushed to the other side. 

* [Bridge to last chorus](https://streamable.com/6g91m) | I always loved the formations they had during this part. Yuri's high note though!!!

Next they performed Airplane. Cutest song ever haha. 

* [Verse/Pre-Chorus](https://streamable.com/fhmtd)

* [Ending](https://streamable.com/gnzm7)

And last but certainly not least they ended with Nekkoya. I was afraid they weren't going to do it but I am thankful they actually did! Seeing as how PD48 was literally my summer last year and Nekkoya was my summer jam and still is on my daily playlist, it's a song I am truly in love with. 

* [Nekkoya Chorus](https://streamable.com/sykt1)

* [Yuri center during bridge and ending](https://streamable.com/98gvd) 

Ahhhhh you need to watch the 2nd video because Yujin and Wonyoung ended up coming over to our side! And man I knew they were pretty but wow. I understand now why they made it into the group. Their talent and fan service was on full display. I'll admit I was biased during PD48 but that's long gone. I was so happy they were right there. Wonyoung's hair especially is so pretty and shiny like wtf. 

After they finished they left and [I caught a couple of them going backstage!!!](https://streamable.com/joxwt). Also here are some more pictures of them, I forgot during which songs they were taken haha. 

* [One](https://i.imgur.com/4sqLMIQ.jpg) | [Two](https://i.imgur.com/7WrSnfz.jpg) | | [Three](https://i.imgur.com/u9alINz.jpg) | [Four](https://i.imgur.com/tZuazFo.jpg) | [Five](https://i.imgur.com/hohbzgc.jpg)

**ENDING**

At the very end of the concert I was truly blessed by both IZONE, LOONA and MOMOLAND getting super close to me. Or more like getting close to them haha. 

[Here is IZONE](https://streamable.com/yocgm) 

* I was paying particular attention to Hitomi and Nako's interaction here. I wonder what they were talking about haha. So much uwuwuwuwu. And of course my OTP, Hyekura. But seriously all of the girls were drop dead gorgeous. 

[Here is LOONA and MOMOLAND](https://streamable.com/tzbg8) 

* Ugh Yves and Kim Lip's fan service was perfect. So jealous of those fans. Also Nancy was such a delight. I love everything about her. Again, all of the girls looked amazing.  

[Official ending with LOONA](https://streamable.com/28x8f)

* My baby Chuu is seriously the best. I love how she picked up the confetti and tossed them haha. MUST PROTECT AT ALL COSTS. It made me happy she got arguably the loudest cheers of all the girls in LOONA throughout the night. 

After the night ended, I drove about 45 minutes south and was buzzing the entire time. I couldn't believe what I just witnessed and I really did have the time of my life.  

**DAY 2**

The next day I got to the convention in time for the ITZY fan club meetup. It wasn't as busy as LOONA's but it was still a lot of fun! I actually got 3rd place in the bingo game (yay me) and it was cool seeing more ITZY fans. We practiced the fanchant guides and actually got some cool banners to hold. When that ended, me and my friend went into the convention and saw a huge crowd. Next thing I know we actually ran into Fromis_9! And they were doing a relay dance and then later a selfie video!

* [Relay dance of Love Bomb](https://streamable.com/vxpi6)

* [Selfie video of Fun](https://streamable.com/a67oh)

* [Group picture](https://i.imgur.com/GmtqyUl.jpg)

As you can tell from the videos it was super crowded and I didn't have the best angle to see them but still it was cool. Excited to see those videos show up on M2 channel on Youtube. After that ended they went to the K-Beauty stage like LOONA did the day before. The front was already crowded so we decided to try and be smart and just hang out near the side where they enter. And boy was that totally worth it!

* [fromis_9 entrance](https://streamable.com/1zzie)

As you can see from the angle we basically couldn't hear or see anything they were talking about lol. [I did appreciate how the banners next to the stage had the 4 main reasons I came to KCONLA haha.](https://i.imgur.com/RFHlGfj.jpg) Eventually their interview ended and they exited. 

* [fromis_9 exit](https://streamable.com/bx3ow)

* [Just Gyuri being an angel](https://streamable.com/pp92e)

I didn't have a fromis_9 bias until I watched PD48 and fell in love with Gyuri. Now she's my bias and I died when she got that close. She's insanely pretty (I know I keep saying this) but it's true. 

After this ended, we just chilled around for a bit in the convention. Next thing we know, there is a huge crowd lining up for something. Didn't know what for but lined up anyways. Waited there for 30 minutes and MAMAMOO showed up! Super brief though as seen in below video lol. 

* [Mamamoo walking](https://streamable.com/ctfey)

Ugh they all looked so good. After this we ended up finding the wall with the signatures. And [I love how LOONA's was signed!!!](https://i.imgur.com/SxWxqRO.jpg). Everyone's signature was so pretty. My friend had a ITZY audience for their artist engagement so I thought fuck it, I need to get one too haha. So I ended up buying one for $25 lol. God bless Twitter. We headed over there and waited until we were let in. Now I didn't really start stanning ITZY until this latest comeback with Icy but I truly fell in love with this group. Their combination of fierce and cute is amazing. The artist engagement was low-key kind of crazy but I thought it was relatively worth it. 

* [Some introductions including Yuna as Hussey](https://streamable.com/gjjpl)

As you can tell my angle is terrible and being short and in the back in the audience really didnt help lol. They ended up playing a game where they spin in circles and then take a selfie. I wasn't able to record Yuna's selfie part but I got the beginning. I did get Yeji's (my bias &lt;3) though. 

* [Chaeryeong chanting ""Go Hussey""](https://streamable.com/wfjl8)

Yeji's team ending up winning and she was so happy she won cookies lol. 

* [Yeji English ""I like cookie""](https://streamable.com/kh95o)

After this they [started the hi-touch](https://streamable.com/i53ko). Was super jealous of everyone who got that lucky lol. Once that ended, my friend and I left to chill outside. He ended up going to Red Carpet and I just chilled in front of the convention center till it was done. Ended up meeting some cool people outside who were into TWICE and LOONA like I was haha. Eventually my friend came back and we went to go eat at the food trucks before the concert. As I mentioned before, the GA floor wasn't full at all so we were in NO rush to go in this time. We went in about 20 minutes before it was supposed to start. Went through the same drill and got a spot. The side with the cameras/Diamond/Platinum was way more full today. Definitely all the SEVENTEEN fans haha. 

**ITZY**

The first GG up was ITZY!!! Started off with Icy. Was absolutely in love with their outfits. Yeji my bias looked stunning and I always love when she has her hair down. All the other girls were gorgeous as well. 

* [Beginning of Icy](https://streamable.com/xr973)

* [Icy Pre-Chorus/Some chorus](https://streamable.com/sjylc)

* [Icy Ending](https://streamable.com/5cmd8)

The choreo was on point. I loved their energy and the hairflips. They have it down to a science haha. 

They then did their intros (which I sadly didn't record). But I did get [more English for Yeji XD](https://streamable.com/xqvq3)

Yeji, Ryujin and Chaeryeong then did a cover of Hard Carry and WOW was that amazing. Featuring Lia and Yuna being cute in the back. 

* [Hard Carry](https://streamable.com/0wcnj)

They then did It'z Summer, one of my favorite B-Sides this year. No doubt a bop. 

* [It'z summer verse (I think lol)](https://streamable.com/a0gag)

* [It'z summer chorus](https://streamable.com/z6miy)

They then ended with Dalla Dalla. They switched sides so we definitely ran to the other side lol. 

* [Dalla Dalla pre-chorus](https://streamable.com/6nd6u)

* [Dalla Dalla Chorus](https://streamable.com/ehzml)

* [Dalla Dalla dance break/bridge](https://streamable.com/udth2)

* [Dalla Dalla ending](https://streamable.com/xdfm0)

Where do I even begin with this song. Seriously lit af. I always thought the song was cool but never really got into it until I started stanning ITZY. Yeji's killing part is always my favorite. The floor move and hairflips are iconic. The crowd was super into it at this point for sure. Wish they could have kept going but alas their set ended. 

Here are some pictures that I took, don't remember during which songs either haha:

Solar had a special stage next but I will put that under the MAMAMOO section. 

**FROMIS_9**

Half of the girls, including Gyuri, started on my side for the Fun intro. Surprised the hell out of me. But once again, I got blessed with my bias. While the intro was great, I love the actual song. It was so cheerful and bubbly of course, perfect summer song. 

* [Fun intro](https://streamable.com/lumpk)

* [Fun chorus](https://streamable.com/fvgvh)

* [Another Fun chorus](https://streamable.com/lvw5p)

Again it goes without saying they are all so pretty. And I love seeing them complete as OT9 now that Gyuri is back, compared to last year. 

Next they did Love Rumpumpum. Such a good B-side/double title track. Glad they ended up promoting it for a bit. 

* [Chorus](https://streamable.com/ok7w7)

After this they did Love Bomb but a remix version. I am not going to lie and say I loved it since I love the original so much but I did enjoy the difference as best I could. I was still singing and having a great time regardless.

The choreo was always fantastic and the girls did great. I thoroughly enjoyed them more this year compared to last as weird as that sounds. Even though last year they did DKDK and To Heart haha. 

Some pictures of fromis_9 that I took:

**MAMAMOO**

Last but not least, Mamamoo. Preface, of course I was really sad that Wheein was unable to make it. But regardless, the girls still did extremely well and I was happy to see them. First earlier in the night, Solar had a special solo stage performing a song from Aladdin? I think aha. That's what someone told me. My main takeaway from it was how pretty she looked. Like a true ice princess. 

* [Solar solo](https://streamable.com/hxnor)

All of MAMAMOO's vocals are insane but I love hearing Solar's for sure. She did a great job. 

Their actual set started with Starry Night. A lovely song. Loved all of the cheers Moonbyul received whenever she started rapping. Not to mention their outfits for the night were hot af. Hwasa in that highlighter green but rocking it for sure haha. 

* [Starry Night](https://streamable.com/ehffg)

Then they did Egotistic. Such a good song. I always loved the chorus. Their stage presence is also so good. Their charisma is undeniable, especially Hwasa. And Solar's adlibs are so damn good here.

Next was Decalcomanie. At this point they split up and started using the full stage. Solar and Hwasa both came to my side so the vids are focused on them. 

* [Solar](https://streamable.com/9oyv2)

* [Hwasa](https://streamable.com/yjdw8)

So hype. Even without Wheein they knew how to work the crowd and use the stage. 

They ended with Gogobebe, probably my favorite MAMAMOO song. 

* [First verse](https://streamable.com/3bkdc)

* [Bridge to chorus](https://streamable.com/h8pct) | Hwasa is the best and this video is the reason why haha. 

Overall they did an amazing job and even though Wheein was missed, it didn't affect their performance too much.

At the end of the concert, I was excited to see ITZY again and hopefully get close. But alas they didn't come out at all T_T But I got some good video of FROMIS_9 and a bit of MAMAMOO when they came my way.

That is officially it! Obviously it would have been even better if Everglow, Chungha, Wheein and all of MOMOLAND was there but still, all of the girl groups did amazing. The convention was the best it has been since I have gone and I thoroughly enjoyed every second I spent over there this past weekend. I'll cherish these memories for a long time. If anyone ever is debating whether to go to KCONLA, I hope this can somewhat convince you. It is seriously awesome, especially if you love the artists like I do. 

If you honestly made it this far reading, wow thank you haha. Its A LOT. I plan on breaking this post up and posting in the individual group subreddits so hopefully that helps alleviate some of the overwhelmness. Otherwise, thanks for reading and I hope all of your K-Pop wishes come true like mine did!!! Was able to see LOONA, IZONE, TWICE and BLACKPINK all this year. Thats 4 of my top 5 GGs. Absolutely the best year of K-Pop in my life no question about it. 

I'll end with some pictures of the slogans I got for LOONA and ITZY.

what if entertainment  companies make backup comebacks?  
like they make a comeback ahead of time so they can release it whenever they want to ""counter"" another groups comeback and lower their views ans sales.....  
like it sounds crazy but think about it.....

for example umpah umpah (red velvet) came outta no where within an extremely short amount of time after their latest comeback and didn't seem to fit their new concept established in zimzalabim.....  
maybe SM saw that everglow are getting alot of hype over their new comeback so they were like lets release our backup comeback to try and get the hype down from everglow..... 

and it didn't work well because it was a comeback that didn't fit their concept very much and wasnt as good as any of their other comebacks....  
there for it was made just for lowering the hype on a group without thinking of quality of the song or its concept....

that would make soo much sense tho

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

Although the Committee has not disclosed the details of the evidences, it is interesting to note that the committee has focused on Idol School rather than the previous seasons of Produce Series where the vote manipulation patterns matching exactly to the Produce X 101 controversy has already been established.

It is reasonable to assume that raising the issue of Idol School has to do with the current CJ ENM's strategy of shielding itself from the controversy by pointing finger at the production team of the series. Since Idol School was produced under a different production team, Idol School vote manipulation, if proven, will indicate the vote manipulation is not a product of one bad apple within a large organization but of the entire system rotten to the core requiring a system-wide criminal investigation.",25,57,False,self,,,,,

Personally, my all-time favorite group for Japanese music is SNSD. I really love the electropop sound of their first Japanese album and Love &amp; Peace, and some of their best songs are Japanese imo (Galaxy Supernova is a masterpiece, okay).

With the votes reset from last round, there are some shuffles in rankings, with people moving up and down. Head over to the [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/kpoproduce-2) to find out the current rankings based on last week's vote.

This week, it's time for position ""evaluation"". The remaining 60 male idols has been assigned to either a vocal, dance or rap group. According to [Kprofiles](https://kprofiles.com/), I will follow the positions they listed as lead or main. If they list more than one position, I will decide using [Random.org](https://Random.org) on the position they will take. I will also use the same site to decide on which group they are assigned to. Those with higher rankings get priority in choosing so a lot of the lower ranked idols are put into positions that might not be their forte.

In each group, you are to choose one person that you want to cast your vote for. The person with the most votes in each group will receive 25 benefit votes. The person with the most votes in each position will receive a total of 60 benefit votes.  The benefit votes could help some people remain in the game after the next elimination round.

There is still a week for you to vote for the idols that you think fits each concept song. You are to choose 7 male idols for each song. And you are allowed to repeat the same idol for multiple songs. There will still be the weekly vote too. Both of these you are allowed to vote up to 7 times. For the ""evaluation"", you are only to vote once.

Head to [Position ""Evaluation""](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx9-3KBsormQAVMhD23rUl9Sf31TdrAR3SGjM3BeQw-DrqMA/viewform?usp=sf_link), [Concept Evaluation Songs](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwgY_5lCF-uEoS1LkXsUsRfD8BtznuN3mGlqX62CkAKOf7KA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and [Weekly Voting](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegfZQZn8Ugxm0KLO_1PcgWiPtOsxNf5l6bcCXhp_eojqKjrw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to vote!

While I get that they are both popular groups, I didn't expect for them to receive that many views in such a short notice of time. Things started to make more sense for me when I saw that their company put their MV's as ads so that their view count would rise. 
My question for the subreddit is what are your thoughts on companies doing this for their artists? While I get that it's a marketing tactic, part of me feels that it's almost dishonest and a bit like cheating in a way? I get that this might be a controversial opinion, but personally I feel that things like stream counts and views should be kept with as much integrity as possible to fully represent how well the song is doing. But on the other hand, I do get that these labels need to get their artists more well known. I'm just... conflicted on this matter.

It is related to BTS or BangTan Seonyeondan!! The K-Pop boy group under BigHit entertainment! Okay so in my English class today we read ""The ones who walk away from the Omelas"". Basically Omelas is a Utopian society situated near a beautiful, shimmering sea. When the story opens, the people of Omelas are celebrating the Summer Festival, an annual event featuring games and horse riding. Underneath this happy, picturesque city, a child has been locked in a cage and forced to live in its own filth. The child's suffering is meant to teach the people of Omelas how cruel justice can be and how precious happiness can be. Sooner or later, every citizen of Omelas learns of the caged child's existence and is taught about the meaning of suffering. Horrified, some people walk away from Omelas, never to return. Okay now think about this in the BTS Music Video for ""Spring Day"" where were they? A building what looked like a hotel called ""Omelas"". Six of the seven members walked away from the ""Omelas"" Taehyung was missing and in his solo ""Stigma"" he got trapped in a cage. You see where I'm going here? Taehyung is the suffering child trapped under this Utopian society and once the others being Seok-Jin, Namjoon, Hoseok, Yoongi, Jimin, and Jungkook found out they ran away. Why didn't they take Taehyung with them? Well simple if they did everything would fall apart and I believe that they went back for Taehyung in the music video for ""Fake Love"" and when they did it all fell apart.

First, I'm an ncitizen (OT 21) so I'm super excited to see Ten and Lucas interacting again with Taeyong and Mark. I don't know EXO or Shinee that well but I've recently been watching their videos to try to get to know them better. I don't really understand the fan-wars at the moment. Why would people want to pit artists against each other or say one's better than another? Especially since they're all under the same company and we've seem numerous interactions between EXO, NCT and Shinee. They obviously care for and respect each other so why shouldn't we do the same? As for the group in general, I am slightly sad that members of NCT are so obviously being favored plus I really hope that the rest of NCT (127, Dream, WayV) don't get neglected while SuperM promotes. Will WayV and NCT 127 promote without Taeyong, Mark, Lucas and Ten? It seems unlikely. Like many other fans have said, I kinda wish SM would put all their energy into promoting their already existing groups rather than starting a whole new one. In my opinion it makes it seem like they are not confident in the groups they already have, so they're making a new one to try to make more money or gain more popularity. I also keep thinking about all the other members of EXO, NCT and WayV. How are they right now knowing that their members get this amazing opportunity while they're being left out? I'm sure they're happy for them/supporting them but I would feel upset if I were them. I guess this is just a huge rant from someone who really cares about NCT lol

I've been living in WA for a while (for college) and so I actually have no friends that like kpop and was wondering if there was a way to meet other kpop fans in this state and in general. There are always concerts that I want to go to (kpop or not) and I always end up missing my chance because I have no one to go with because if we're being honest, no one's going to pay for and go to a concert that they have little to no interest in y'know?

Plus, even though I have a handful of friends that like kpop back at home, kpop idols/groups rarely ever go to where I'm from for really anything lol.

I think itd be interesting to see the different reasons people find certain idols attractive.

For me it has to be Sakura from IZ*ONE.  While she isnt my bias in that group, shes always been one of my top three members in terms of looks. I dont really know a lot about her and for the longest time Id been crushing on other idols so beyond that Id basically overlooked her. And then I watched the IZ*ONE episode of Men on a Mission on Netflix last week. I dont follow anything outside of album releases so this was my first time seeing her outside of MVs, the photobooks that come with albums, and pictures/gifs posted on Reddit and other sites. Since seeing that episode though, Ive been absolutely smitten. I already thought she was cute but I really like her sense of humor and how she interacts with others. Obviously I have no chance of dating her but Id be lying if I said I wouldnt jump at the chance. 

For a bias Id date I have to go with Anne from GWSN. Ive always found her gorgeous and while I do favor how she looks in some images/gifs over others that attraction hasnt gone away. Its shallow but Id be lying if I said I wasnt drawn in by her beauty.

For me, those are two idols I think of when I imagine myself with an idol. Obviously there are others as well but these two definitely have their appeal. If you guys had to pick one or more idols to date, who would you and why?",25,0,False,self,,,,,

Although PD Note did not exactly point Produce X 101 by name, the recent idol audition program steeped in vote manipulation controversy pretty much narrowed the field down to one particular program.

I go by DJ Hydeheart and I'm mostly a 90's and K-POP DJ in Houston. I started DJ'ing about a year ago and have since one of the few DJ's in Houston who have been holding K-POP nights in the city.

In the 27th edition of the the [""Off The Pill Podcast""](https://youtu.be/I8nWBgUq-n4?t=2207) by popular old school youtuber Ryan Higa (nigahiga), this week\`s guest was Jun Sung Ahn, an upcoming kpop idol and violinist. Its a good podcast, recommend watching it, but the subject of this post is the following:

At min 36:48 the host asks if Jun had any **""rude encounters from famous kpop idols""** to to which he replies: (paraphrased)  
""At KCON I do this thing, I MC, because I\`m bilingual, so they have this things called fan engagements where they come on stage and answer questions, like an interview.I take the question, I ask it in korean, I translate them for the audience....There was this one specific member of his girl group that was just completely different on stage than how she was off stage, like the second she got off stage, she called for a manager to get her water... Like a really bitchy diva, to the point that on stage was very bubbly and the second she came down, her smile disappeared, her face completely changed...""  
After that, the host asks for a name and jokingly imply that he might be talking about BLACKPINK, then the subject carries on.

What am i trying to find out is what girl group or member was he talking about. A girl who **smiles** a lot on stage, from **big girl group** which **attended KNCON** in US, which held a **fan engagement** and at which **Jun was MC**.

Some info:  
\-date of the interview was 11 August  
\-the interview is held in Las Vegas, Jun might is based in Los Angeles and he is from New Jersey  
\-according with Juns wikipedia page, he attended both kcon **LA** and NY  
\-blackpink never attended kcon  
\-Jun also mentions that its one of the biggest girl groups

There is quite some info to comb trough (like the lineup of kcon LA and maybe NY) and lots of unknowns for me, so help me out. Again, this is purely for curiosity, make of it a fun internet hive mind demonstration and not a witch hunt.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

however, it could also just be that i have this perception because i am a lot more active on international stan twt, where news of somebody dating is usually perceived quiet neutral with lots of memes.

so, has there been a change in being more accepting towards dating on the korean side of the fandoms?",39,8,False,self,,,,,

I saw them first on the same episode of Inkigayo as another boy group called LUCENTE. I followed both groups only for ATEEZ to be extremely popular while LUCENTE kinda fell into underrated territory and now they are barely heard of now. ATEEZ seemed like they would have a great start like SF9 but then dwindle into more underrated unpopular. However I'm surprised and pleased to see how far they have gotten. 

For unpopular, even though I dont follow them, I'm pretty surprised how underrated the girl group loona is. Especially with the whole meme about stanning them, it seemed like it was everywhere and they had a somewhat successful debut but then afterwards they just sorta faded into underrated territory. Compared to ATEEZ, I didnt see much discussion of their latest comeback as much as I saw Wave/Illusion being talked about however they are still known more than LUCENTE. 

Honorable mentions go to Golden Child and TRCNG because with how popular B.A.P and INFINITE are, you would think their little brother groups would have done well too (although we know how shit TS is with their groups and Woolim isnt that great either so it may have something to do with the companies themselves). VERIVERY seem to be doing excellent and will definitely be fitting the voice when all members of VIXX are in the military. The Boyz and Dreamcatcher also come to mind where, especially with Dreamcatcher going from MINX and being underrated and barely heard of to where they are now, it's impressive how popular they have become. The Boyz felt like to me they wouldnt be as popular as they are but they are certainly getting their name out there and have been pretty successful. I would mention NU'EST but they were a special case and they got a second chance because of PD101 and Wanna One",175,132,False,self,,,,,

So, it makes a lot of sense that they didnt splurge a whole lot on them. On the other hand, Wanna One made it big, so they invested more in them.

Now, fast forward to IZ*ONEs debut - why was the budget low? Looking at their debut MV, the trailers, and everything, it all seems... a little bit... mediocre? I love the girls with all my heart, and Im not trying to hate on them, but compared to X1s debut teasers (each member had 2), their music video teaser (which looks very, very high budget), and finally - their debut showcase, which looks very promising (and expensive).

Why cant they invest in IZ*ONE the same way? They are already a huge group, competing with the biggest GGs out there. The members are all popular and have huge fan bases in Korea AND Japan, thanks to the J-line. It seriously baffles and angers me so so so much. If MNET would only invest in IZ*ONE like JYP invests in TWICE and ITZY, they would be wayyyyyyy more popular than they are (and theyre pretty damn popular as is).

Please share your views. Also, excuse my English, as I am not a native speaker.",39,0,False,self,,,,,

I always see comments like ""oh Mamamoo is so gay!"" or ""They did it for the gays"" and I don't get it? It's often for things the idol did that aren't even gay. Like, I saw a post on instagram showing the ratio of male and female fans to popular girl groups and whenever a group had more female fans people commented ""They said gay rights"". I don't get how having a lot of female fans means being gay? 

It's just kind of gross to me how they seem to use being gay as an accessory. It's really uncomfortable to see especially since way too many of them seem convinced every fanservice is the idols actually like making out or something. I used to follow a lot of TWICE accounts and they always made gay jokes about Sana and Jihyo and they were all legit heartbroken when Jihyo was revealed to be dating Daniel. Some of them closed down their accounts because they were so upset that Jihyo wasn't really gay for Sana. It was just so sick to see how many abandoned them because Jihyo wasn't gay and it made me question why so many fans are obsessed with idols possibly being gay. I know it happens with any dating news (fans being heartbroken, etc), but why do people INSIST idols be gay or they don't count? Why is it shameful to have male fans/be a man?

And why the hell is there so much discord between straight and gay fans? ""Heteros aren't welcome""? What's up with that? I'm just really confused as to why being gay is suddenly used as like an argument for things. Not trying to be offensive to anyone but can someone explain? Thanks.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

A place to talk about 'nugu' groups and share information, performance videos, etc. [Here's a link to last week's roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cs5q00/nugu_roundup_7_six_appeal_190818/). This week features another very under-the-radar group, but one that just had a comeback, let's get to know G-reyish.  

**What is Nugu?**

For purposes of this series I'm defining it as groups that aren't from the 'Big 3+1' companies and that haven't yet won a music show. The term isn't meant as a slight to any of the groups mentioned here, this is about bringing some attention to groups that deserve it that are flying under the radar.

**And now onto the show...**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Most Recent Comeback:** August, 22nd 2019 with Kkili Kkili ([MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm4rXMKvCkw)) Live Stage ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hL1PFb1_8U)) a summery electro-dance-pop song.

Originally had a 'no leader' concept, but Hye Ji seems to have stepped into the role.   Member Yeso wants to learn how to compose and produce her own music.

**Vlogs:** [Be.A YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/kmuchofficial/videos)

**Trivia:** They originally debuted with two names - K.Much in English, and Gamulchi Korea (which means Snake Head).  They then revised their Korean name to K.Much as well and then rebranded to Be.A in 2017 following a Makestar campaign that let fans pick from a list of new names (Be.A means 'Be an Artist', which was thankfully chosen over B.O.T' meaning 'Boys on Top').  Starting as a five member group members BomB and Milly have recently left the group.  Member ATO and former member BomB are in Crayon Pop's Saturday Night and Bar Bar Bar (story version) videos, and the group performed with Crayon Pop during their 2nd Tokyo concert.

**Trivia:** Kisum is pretty prolific, and may well be known better than I think she is, especially in K-Hip-Hop circles, but she doesn't seem to get a ton of attention hear and I've fallen in love with her sound so I figured I'd include her.  She'sgood friends with Heize and Kasper, was in a duo with Se-A early in her career, and seems to have collaborated with a lot of people.  She was on the first season of Unpretty Rapstar (where she came in 5th place) as well as on Show Me the Money.

Having attended all of the past KCONs in Los Angeles, including the very first year in Irvine, I have been usually busy with working as press. After a two year break, I had the privilege to attend as press this year representing r/kpop. Fellow r/kpop mods u/Juicysteak117, u/Concepizual and u/Tuckyd were also in attendance, with Tuckyd appearing on two convention panels.  

**Convention**

I arrived at around 4:00 on Friday to pick up my badge and scout out the whole venue. It feels like they keep changing the locations of the convention hall and panel rooms every year. Being there on Friday is nice since it is much less crowded. I didn't plan on going to the KCON Rookies event since I originally planned to arrive later at night. The line already looked pretty crazy by the time I got there. 

Doing photography at a convention can be very tiring. I averaged 16,000 steps a day over the weekend while carrying 12+pounds of camera equipment the whole time. The press work room was located far away from everything (near convention registration), making for a long trip any time I needed a break. 

In the past, shooting the red carpet event was my highlight of the weekend as it was a very unique experience. They have only an official photographer attend now since the event is now live streamed. We also did try to request for interviews (live AMA!) but didn't get lucky. The performing artists are usually very busy and only do interviews with major outlets like MTV and Billboard.  

News of idols appearing on the convention floor seemed to be announced shortly beforehand on the KCON social media, possibly for safety reasons. Huge crowds would instantly build up for any celebrity appearance, slowing all foot traffic in the area and making it difficult to get anywhere in the convention.  

It takes a lot of planning and luck to get a great shot. Some fans start holding spots hours in advance to be in the front.  

LOONA is up there! somewhere [(1)](https://i.imgur.com/IuoOhuu.jpg). Ah ha! (Zoomed in on someone's phone) [(2)](https://i.imgur.com/nDnHIz0.jpg)

To get artists in and out of the convention, they roped off long exit corridors and had heavy security. I think IZ\*ONE was making an appearance at one of the makeup booths. I really should have switched to my normal lens or my phone, my zoom lens was too much for when they were right by me. [(3)](https://i.imgur.com/kosLq6Q.jpg) Hello! [(4)](https://i.imgur.com/P882UBL.jpg).

[(5)](https://i.imgur.com/e23C2uu.jpg) In this picture, the staff photographer is blocking people from getting a good shot. (Dude pretty much had free access for photos the whole time when they were at the booth and decides he also wants pictures of the group walking, so he ends up blocking the view for waiting fans \*angryface\*)  

I used my phone the next time around for MAMAMOO [(6)](https://streamable.com/48k1p). (That is not me yelling)

N.Flying at Star Square [(9)](https://i.imgur.com/k10RhC8.jpg). Fans could get really close at Star Square.  

The dance workshops were quite popular all weekend and seemed to always have something happening. Can you guess which choreography this is? [(10)](https://i.imgur.com/DNVVpCV.jpg)

I loved this signature wall. [(11)](https://i.imgur.com/pAPiHI7.jpg) [(12)](https://i.imgur.com/XHemMS1.jpg). Outside of your bias groups, you don't really see other signatures unless you are specifically looking for it. LOL @ how simple Lee Dos (ONEUS) signature is, it seems to stick out a lot. San (ATEEZ) has a sunrise? I think my favorites are Chungha and Yeji (ITZY).  

At the convention, I couldn't get myself to line up for anything at the sponsor booths in the middle area or the makeup booths at the corner since I felt like I should be running around to take more pictures. I did manage to catch parts of a few panels.  

I was hoping to visit the merchandise booths before closing time on Sunday since some sellers tend to lower prices at the end (so they have less to carry back). Instead I spent that time catching up with other press people I haven't seen in years.

**Concert**

This was the first time I ever got lucky enough to buy floor tickets. Since I was busy running around taking pictures, I didn't have a chance to line up early like most people do for the floor. I knew from all the past KCON concerts, that the artist will always perform their first song (and special stages) facing the front since the main broadcast cameras are there. 

Luckily, I was able to find a spot near the front both nights. Day 1, I was actually [behind this legend](https://www.reddit.com/r/iZone/comments/crqcdu/190817_the_same_guy_from_kcon_ny_2019_came_to/) sadly he only brought in one light stick to the concert.  

I liked the artist lineup overall, but was hoping for more diversity as a few of the groups had just attended last year. 

One thing I noticed is that group members didn't do individual introductions this year during their talking segment. Hi Im \_\_\_! Nice to meet you!... and its many variations. With some groups having many members, it was understandable they cut that to save time. 

I was most excited to see LOONA and IZ\*ONE, both were amazing, as expected. ITZY impressed me a lot too.  

N.Flying did a great job on their Queen cover medley. The guys behind me had no idea who the group was initially, but totally agreed to stan after the set.    

Stray Kidz Miroh was the hypest song, with the STRAY KIDS WOO part being the loudest the audience fanchant/scream all weekend. If you watched any fancams, it was actually much much louder in person.  

Seventeen was hilarious with their never-ending NICE encores. I was close enough to be in the splash zone and got waterbottle blessed by one of the members.

Instead of posting my own fancams, Ill share these short official clips that were given to press outlets. They are quite intense, being shot at the foot of the stage at a glorious 60 fps. Enjoy!

My example would be NCT, I really like Mark, Johnny, and Lucus personality. I am guaranteed a laugh whenever they are in some Broadcast or videos, but most of NCT's music I don't care for. I do like about 3 songs, but usually, they aren't my cup of tea.

Or the opposite where I will love a groups music, but I watch their TV appearances and find them kinda boring.

I really don't have anything planned for this week and accidentally overslept on my nap, so this song list for the Jukebox this week really going to be on the spot. I'll try to pick some current songs but also have a B-side or two and some older songs? We'll see. Here's the song list!

Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, **please give the song a score between 1 and 10.** 1 being this song does not make you move, and 10 being this song is something you immediately fell in love with! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you may use the music video to inform your overall score for the song  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do [feel free to check out the very first Jukebox thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/)

woollim debuted their boygroup golden child in 2017 after showcasing some of the boys talents in w project. 2 years later and the group still hasnt found their place in the industry and are still pretty nugu. golcha havent had a cb for nearly a year now.

not even a month ago, woollim debuted their new girl group rocket punch and they seem to have had a great debut.

now, woollim seem to be interested in debuting their remaining boys from produce x 101. theyre releasing a w project in a week consisting of what seems to be their final line up, these six boys have been attending senior concerts together since produce ended. i also see the fact that they recruited an apparently very talented guy during produce and one of the independent trainees from produce as a sign that theyre planning something soon.

i dont really know a lot about woollim but isnt it going to be hard to manage these 3 rookie groups + infinite and lovelyz at the same time? i only recently started following woollim because of the boy trainees, but seeing how theyre managing golden child makes me a bit nervous about the future for the woollim boys. seems like golcha have been pretty much shoved under the rug at this point.

im really curious to hear some views on this though!",12,16,False,self,,,,,

All throughout high school I was plagued with depression and was hospitalized at age 16 for planning suicide. The following years, I was put on several different medications that never actually did anything to help. I continued to cut myself and have frequent thoughts of suicide. Most nights I went to bed either crying or feeling so dead inside I didn't have the energy to cry. Even though it felt like hell, I felt I deserved it and looking back I could see I was looking for any good reason to kill myself. That's when I met her.

There was a girl at my work who I happened to talk to sometime and found we shared some interests and hobbies. Of course I fell almost instantly and asked her out only to get turned down since she had a boyfriend, but oddly enough that didn't get me down. I figured I would bide my time and wait for the relationship to inevitably end, and it did. But I found, to my surprise, that one of my friends at work and from high school was also into her and we spent the next several months trying to be the one she wanted to date.

I'll spare the dirty details, she wasn't into either of us despite the fact we had made out several times and she told me she was into me but had promised a friend not to date until the end of the summer. Well the end of the summer came and instead of choosing one of us, she chose a third guy at work that neither of us really knew that well. This absolutely broke my heart and I bought a rope, wrote a suicide note, and prepared to kill myself. I cut so deeply into my thighs that the scars are still there even after all this time. 

It was the weekend and I was ready to die. I figured I would do it Monday when my parents would be away from the house, but that's when I saw it. A friend on Snapchat advertised that he was selling LSD and I thought ""fuck it, I'll do some before I leave forever"". I had previously done 100ug and thought it was interesting, but not mindblowing. This time I bought 200ug for myself and another 100ug for a friend, but the friend backed out and I took 300ug.

It was a Sunday night and I was enduring one of the most miserable experiences of my life, I could feel myself withering away and hating all the decisions I had made in my life.

Before continuing, it's important to note that she had shown me Kpop and I had taken a great liking to it, particularly BTS and TWICE. I had fallen for her around the time LY Her came out, started feeling alone and lied to around the time LY Tear came out, and now it was the weekend LY Answer came out. Due to everything going on up to this point, I hadn't listened to any of the songs on Answer except Epiphany which I had seen a few weeks prior.

Back to the story, I was starting to come down and needed to drive home, which was about 30 minutes away. On that car ride I played the new album and the messages of loving yourself broke through to me for the first time. I had a conversation with myself in which I accepted the situation I was in and accepted myself as who I am. The LSD broke down the barriers I had put up and BTS changed my life. I cried my eyes out, but not out of the sadness and self pity I had usually felt, but for happiness that I was feeling changed.

After that night, I threw away the rope, burned the suicide note, stopped cutting, and genuinely felt changed. The very idea of killing myself made me feel nauseous. I made up with the friend at work I had hated for going after the same girl and we are still good friends today. The girl and I are on okay terms and I'm actually glad things didn't work out between the two of us, I'm a better person because of it and I can see now I would have been miserable with her. 

Every day I wake up I feel this unbelievable gratefulness to be alive and it feels my life is finally worth living. I am eternally grateful to both BTS and LSD for helping me save my life. I had always felt bitter towards people who said that music saved their life, it wasn't until this experience that I finally understood.

This was my own experience and I do not condone the use of drugs to fight depression as they affect everyone differently, but if you are struggling with depression just know that things can get better and please seek out help.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

(week 53),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/cvqd08/any_kpop_video_translation_request_week_53/,ThisGuyKpops,1566836862," Hi, my name is JOJO owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w?view_as=subscriber). I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. Good luck!

P.S: Next video is on top 10 visual of kpop. Should be done this week. Finally decided to do visual essay style, so its been going well. Look forward to it!",9,40,False,self,,,,,

For example, she punches a wall down which is similar to the falling sign in heroine.

Then in the middle of the MV there is a long pause similar to Gashina, then there is the drop of the song.

Her dancing in front of the beauty salon is similar to the dancing in front of the food place in Gashina.

Then there is blue blackground scenes similar to in Noir.

Lastly, the dancing in a black room is like Heroine.

It's just a theory, but I think the similarities are deliberate, as the song talks about critisism that she has recieved?",1,3,False,self,,,,,

2NE1 - I Am The Best

Taemin - Move

I distinctly remember the first time I heard these songs in 2011 and 2017. No matter how many times I've listened to IATB, I still feel 100x more excited and pumped up. Those first three seconds of the song are enough to just start my own dance party, haha.

# FAQ

## How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

Even worse is if one does play one of those songs, but like only a few people dance to it when you remember mass crowds joining in older ones.  The only one I feel consistently gets play time in random play dances is Sorry Sorry which I truly feel is a testament to that song's catchiness.  I guess this is a matter of when you get into kpop since those songs were the 'hot tracks' of the time that everyone could dance to and as newer songs become popular obviously those will fade out, but man it's just a small thing that makes you feel how long you've been into the genre.  Maybe I'm just slowly turning into an old fogey but it says something when in a recent one I just watched, the oldest song on it was Seventeen's Adore U.

K-Pop discords are a fantastic place and way to follow your favorite groups while also constantly interacting with fellow fans *(better than twitter group-chats, single/multiple 1-2 manned twitter update accounts, and even reddit imo LOL)*

That being said, the [SuperM discord server](https://discord.gg/dGJySSp) is now starting to shape up and we'd really love for those of you who are interested to join us!

We have organized channels specifically for:

* Updates
* Schedules
* Content media uploads (where variety/reality shows, fancams, performances, and etc will be posted)
* Subs/Translations (soon)
* Group channel for group pic previews/HQ's, fancams, etc
* Individual member channels for their individual HQ pic, fancams, updates, and etc will be posted
* On and Off topic discussion channels *\*(Discord's active 24/7 with peeps from all around the world to talk/spazz with; primarily speak ENG)*
* gifs, memes, livestreams, and all else in between-so much more to behold :)

As we all know Korea is still a very conservative country regarding sexuality (amongst other things) and to my knowledge no idol has ever came out to the public yet.

It's inconceivable that in such a huge industry with such an incredible amount of idols that not a single one is LGBTQ+. 

They are out there, of course. A lot of them, in my estimation. 

But what do you think it will take for an idol to go out there and open up this conversation in the South Korean society? 

Will it take one of the big companies to back them up? Or do you think Korea is still very far away from this conversation and the person would be immediately ostracized? 

I don't know if will take an idol from this generation we're going through right now or an older idol from gen 1 or 2 to open up this discussion, but I think it's incredibly important to even have the discussion. 

For people that are even more tuned in to the industry, has there even been a closer look on this subject? Or is just really never talked about it?

One really talented group that comes to mind is Vromance. They are from RBW, the same company as Mamamoo and Oneus. I think they have yet to reach 1 million on any of their music videos but I think we can attribute their lack of success partly to the company for never promoting them and placing other groups as priority. They are a group of 4 extremely talented vocalists and everyone should really support them. I also think KNK is awesome, I got to know them through mixnine and their music is actually great and they are all such talented guys (they had a comeback recently). It's also great that A.C.E seems to be gaining fans recently since I believe they are the most well-rounded kpop group currently. 

In terms of a group that became forgotten too quickly I have to say Spica. I think of them as the predecessors to Mamamoo since they were all such phenomenal vocalists. But they really fell off the grid and, unfortunately, disbanded after an unsuccessful comeback. It is truly unfortunate considering their notoriety as some of the best vocalists in kpop. Lastly, I am very disappointed about Stellar. They had interesting music with great production, but they disbanded before they were even given a chance. Their one popular song seemed to be a sexy concept they were forced into. Of course this is my opinion on such talented groups. What are your opinions?",24,0,False,self,,,,,

So, I went to FNC GTC this summer and wanted to share my experience.

When I first signed up I was scared it was gonna be a scam but obviously it wasnt because then I wouldnt be writing this. I went for the 1 month program. The fee is 3,7 million won which is about $3000, with flight I ended up paying a total of about $3800-4000.

Now lets talk about the actual course. I got to Seoul a few days before and stayed at a hotel. I then met up at the station with the others. 
The people were all ages from early teens to early twenties. We then walked to our dorms and then we went for a little tour around the training center. After that we had a few days off before our first practice. 

Practice was fun. The vocal teacher is really good and very chill. The dance teacher is also very talented but a little less chill. You can practice by yourself from 10 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday. And you have 2 dance rooms that everyone shares and then there was like 6-8 vocal rooms. You have Dance, Vocal, Korean and one acting class.

After you left the practice center the dont care about what you do. You can go anywhere, eat anything, do whatever you want, etc. So on weekends most people went to the public auditions and then we went shopping or to the park. I really recommend going to Seoul Forest, Ttukseom park and Coex if youre going. Dont go to Itaewon because its not worth it. 

We had profile shooting and private audition too. For private audition you prepare a Korean song that you are going to sing. You also need to prepare a dance. So you walk into the building and then the called us into groups of three people. They had two cameras. You look into the camera and say your name, nationality, height and weight. You dont have to say it in Korean but it is a plus if you do it. After that you do your thing and they might ask you a few questions and then you go back.

Well my overall review is that it was amazing.
I would really recommend going and Im probably going again if Im able to. 

If anything was unclear or you have any other questions feel free to ask me!",8,14,False,self,,,,,
