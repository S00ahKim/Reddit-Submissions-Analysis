Last year in November I gave away a BIGBANG ticket here due to someone bending me over and having their way on me (hur dur...). This year I screwed up (I take full blame! OOPS!) and I have two extra tickets of TVXQ (they're seated together, row S, they were $100 plus fees each). The show is in Los Angeles THIS FRIDAY. 


I want to give them away to two redditors (or a pair to a single redditor, depending on circumstances). Tell me why I should pick you. Don't PM me please. Post your reply here. I'll close this on Wednesday evening and update on who I chose.

It's been 50 years since Canada and South Korea established a diplomatic relationship. Our Prime Minister recently declared 2013 as the Year of Korea in Canada and the South Korean Prime Minister in turn declared 2013 as the Year of Canada in Korea.

To celebrate Canada Day, I've written a round-up post of Canadian K-pop idols, including which cities you should be in to run into them when they return to visit their families.

 i think it would be nice if we could have all the recent releases listed on the sidebar. I hate having to dig through all the posts to find the actual music videos to new songs, especially when i haven't been on here in a while. i completely miss them sometimes and they randomly get suggested to me on youtube.

 i think it would be super helpful to have them linked on the sidebar for easy access, with the release date. and maybe even upcoming come-backs listed as well, so i know what to be excited for! it would mean less digging through random teaser posts and not finding the actual video. 

let me know if you guys think this would help anyone other than me!",30,38

I wanted to be able to sing a couple of Korean songs, but I have had trouble being able to read the lyrics and sing along.  So I decided to slow them down and repeat some of the lines so that I could more easily practice. Each song is played twice slowly. The first pass is just the song played slowly; the 2nd pass has some of the lines repeated a few times.  I would have liked to have done a better job making these but I didn't have time.

(DB5K)",[deleted],1373755161,"So I've always thought that one day, HoMin's contract with SM Entertainment will run out and they will return as 5 again. The reason I've always thought this is because I imagine they (particularly HoMin, but JYJ as well) could make a lot more money for themselves if they'd return as 5. This because obviously HoMin wouldn't have to share revenue with SM anymore and that as 5 they'd generate much more publicity. 

Is this a realistic thought, or is this very unlikely? ",30,16

It's been awhile since i've posted about these! I've been busy with work and stuff...so I don't have alot of the newer ringtones starting from the beginning of the year until now...but I can sure make them! anyway! 

I can take any song or clip from a video/show and make it into a ringtone. 

Here are the past ones I have done:

* [kpop ringtones - (10-28 seconds long)](http://www.hulkshare.com/playlist/74600)
* [kpop texttones - (1-5 seconds long)](http://www.hulkshare.com/playlist/74604)

If anyone has requests, please provide the following:

* artist - song 

* ring tone or text tone (or approx time duration wanted) 

* any specific section of the song? (ex: ""the part at :33 where Sooyoung says 'ayo GG!'"" or ""the first line of Gain- Bloom and the beat right up to before the second line"") 

* phone operating system (android, Iphone, blackberry) and file format. I know android uses mp3, and Iphone in think uses .m4a.

NEW RINGTONES/TEXTTONES WILL BE ADDED TO [the Recently Added Playlist](http://www.hulkshare.com/playlist/74723), I will also comment on your request with a direct link :)

I will do a new post once a month, but I will continue to check this one until the new one is posted.",47,24

I posted over in r/SNSD a week ago, but I figured r/kpop should get a chance to use the discount too.

You can get 20% off anything in the store (not just the SNSD shirts) by using coupon code **BYEBYE20** at checkout. The sale runs until the end of July.

On the store's [main page](http://www.etsy.com/shop/kpopgear) you'll find links to each section of the shop. There is a ton of SNSD stuff (due to popular demand), but also 2NE1, f(x), Big Bang, T-ara, Girl's Day, 4Minute, Dal Shabet, Sistar, Miss A and more. 

If you have any special requests (tank tops, hoodies, sweatshirts, plus sizes, etc) please pm me on here or message me through the store. I'll do my best to help you in any way I can.

I'm working on some new stuff for a lot of groups who have had comebacks recently, so stay tuned. If you have suggestions, let me know!

Thanks!",35,20

A little background of me: I've probably been listening to Korean pop stars my whole life. My family is Taiwanese so my knowledge of Asian music is pretty extensive. The point of me making this thread is to generate some discussion within the subreddit to bring us more together and to introduce some older Kpop stars that may or may not be active in the Kpop world. 

   Without further ado, I would like to introduce to ""Queen Bee"" of Kpop, BoA! ID;PeaceB is on BoA's debut album with the same name as the single. Let's just say that this song aged pretty okay, but the music video did not... Well just give her a listen and you can see how she had grown as a musician from 12 years ago. Here's PeaceB by BoA.

What I am more interested in is the amount of money and popularity lost out of potential profit to the division of money that people spend (?)

~~To say it more clearly, I'll give an example. Let's say that Big Bang, 2NE1, and Akdong Musicians (debut) are having a comeback in sometime future. Fan A has a chance to go to Inkigayo, but can only choose one group. Fan B lives in Australia but has a limited amount of money that he can spend, so he chose to buy a CD for only one group. Of course, fan A and B are really happy, but could only support one of the groups.~~

~~This is a bit of a bad example, but the main idea of that was will there be a big contrast of potential profit and fan popularity to the company as a whole as oppose to when the company releases the comebacks separately?~~

Sorry if my wordings don't make any sense. I'll edit it when someone gives a suggestion.

What kind of year has it been for K-Pop, and what comebacks are you looking forward to should also be included.

So far, my list would look like this:

1. Nine Muses - [Wild](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwN_Axs7pL4&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLpu1k69CHUvZtpSg7cqUa-PB3MQO1TyLK)
2. Sistar19 - [Gone Not Around Any Longer] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtVhwsACgTw&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLpu1k69CHUvZtpSg7cqUa-PB3MQO1TyLK)
3. Wonder Boyz - [Tarzan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WKkX-4HHP0&amp;list=PLpu1k69CHUvZtpSg7cqUa-PB3MQO1TyLK)
3. Girls Generation - [IGAB](http://youtu.be/wq7ftOZBy0E)
5. 2PM - [A.D.O.T.Y] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFnV7Y6iwrA&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLpu1k69CHUvZtpSg7cqUa-PB3MQO1TyLK)

I'm not counting BEG's ""Recipe"" since it's a pre-release single, otherwise that would be number 1, imho. Aside from that, I feel that most of the more well-known male idol groups haven't really put out anything stellar, aside from Shinee and the aforementioned 2PM.

Thoughts?

I didn't particularly like her personality or anything, but during Genie and Oh! (her blondie days), I found her to be one of the most attractive girls in kpop and would stare in awe whenever I saw a picture of her. Things changed though, around the Hoot era, when I noticed something off about her. That charm I fell head over heels over was gone. At first I assumed it was the darker hair, because I loved her blonde phase, but I later found out she had jaw surgery and had her jaw shaved. She is still so beautiful, but man, pre surgery, I never saw anyone more charming in kpop. Her jaw really suited her face. How about the rest of the kpop community?

I came across this post on allkpop in the comments of the Bom and Dara sock article. Its a new song by an artist by the name La Materialista called [Chipi ChaCha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fKepU_cBGA) and its a blatant copy of 2NE1's I AM THE BEST.

Like all other Korean articles I've posted, please be aware that I don't read Korean and am only going off of what others on twitter or GDD are saying! Will update with English sources when they're out.


Just to be clear, IU already announced that she was leaving and Minah is taking the spot that she left, she wasn't kicked out for Minah to replace her or anything (AFAIK of course). Just wanted to clarify in case the wording of my title was unclear.
