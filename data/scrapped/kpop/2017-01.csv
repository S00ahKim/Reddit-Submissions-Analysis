1.) I think we'll be seeing lots more tropical &amp; trap type elements in kpop. I happen to like that sound, so I'm ok with it, but I think that it will probably become very annoying for some.

2.) I think we'll be seeing a lot more high concept MV's with interludes in the MV. Examples are BTS' ""Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears"", Mamamoo's ""Decalcomanie"", B.A.P.'s ""Skydive"", etc. This trend does kinda annoy me.

3.) I think we'll see more rock. I think 2016 had a surprising number of rock released in the kpop industry and I think (hope) we'll see more.

* [SHINee's Minho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amkhH1zq-Q4): He used to be really quiet and reserved on variety (i.e. One Fine Day) but this year he has come out of his shell. In performances I could get a glimpse of his personality more than I did in the past. I enjoyed watching him get angry/loud on Weekly Idol. He wasn't afraid to tease Cony &amp; Dony back. 

* [Shinee's Onew](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x54vs8f_eng-sub-161201-shinee-on-yang-and-nam-show-part-2_fun): I don't know if it was the attention he received from Descendants of the Sun or the retro comeback but something changed in Onew that made him more comfortable within himself. To me, he seems to be comfortable with and is embracing his looks (which there is nothing wrong with) and is relaxing more. Watching him sass it up as Key on the Yang and Nam show was one of the variety highlights of the year.

* [BTS' V](https://youtu.be/LlDDeMRWF1k?t=11m45s): I think that V has mellowed out a lot this year. He still has his quirky sense of humor but it's on a smaller scale. He used to be very hyper, rambunctious, and would do stupid things for attention. Now, he has tamed his energy on variety and in Bangtan Bombs which makes me appreciate him more.",66,57,False,self,,,,,

**FAQ**

- **Q. Why isn't Navillera or [Song Title] on Spotify yet?**

It all depends on the label if they want to release their content to Spotify. Navillera for example is outed because SourceMusic doesn't see any benefit for releasing on the Spotify platform, even with the LOEN deal. 

- **Q. Where's all the JYP music?**

Currently region locked to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. 

- **Q. Why are songs region locked?**

Some songs are region locked due to exclusivity deals. For example, BTS's Young Forever is still unavailable in the United States due to Apple Music grabbing an exclusive streaming deal with BigHit. Some are region locked because the label just wants it to be available to certain countries, case and point with APink's new album 'Dear' only being available in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Phillipines, Australia and New Zealand.

Part of my job is to come up with clever design ideas for t-shirts and merch thatll appeal to the k-wave cultural niche in North America.

Heres the thing, though: I know *nothing* about this culture. Im like the Jon Snow of Korea. Ive never watched a k-drama in my life, and my sole point of reference for k-pop is Gangnam Style.

Ive been picking up bits and pieces here and there, just fitting k-stuff into my day-to-day  but this gig is gonna start soon, and I kinda need a crash course on the ABCs of k-wave culture before then. The lingo, the in-jokes, the memes  hopefully some sparknotes version thatll help me at least look like I know what Im talking about. Please teach me how to kpop. 

TLDR: I took a graphic design gig for a k-pop/k-drama fan merch store. I know nothing about either, but am now expected to brainstorm clever design ideas for k-fan merch. Halp.",37,32,False,self,,,,,

1. They're a subsidiary of Polaris Entertainment which means their parent company is Ilgwang Group if you google it they are a private arms military company that has deals with South Korea's government to answer your question no they ain't broke or have limited finances

 

2. Their headquarter is located in Gangnam area a rich area why would you think a nugu company with limited financial capabilities are having an office there? for references this particular district is where SM JYP Cube and FNC offices are.

 

3. The MVs for several of Loona members particularly Haseul and Hyunjin are shot in foreign countries and they are scheduled to have like almost 15-20 MVs in total predebut wise no broke company would plan that with predebut members and nugu hypes which means financial wise they have nothing to lose if it flops

 

4. This isn't the first time this kind of strategy has been used Woollim indirectly gave hint of Lovelyz by releasing singles for Baby Soul, Jin and Jiae and even discreetly put them on several variety shows such as Immortal Songs 2 and Running Man and giving them MVs and featuring with famous names.

It's basically an edited clip without the backing track so you can actually hear the members sing to see how good they are live I guess. Cool stuff. But then I looked at the dislike bar and comments and was surprised by what I saw. Pretty much everyone in the comment section is salty because this song won the song of the year award or something when their live performance was ""shit"" and I'm just sitting here thinking... that's what the hate is about? Who cares about an award? I mean I get that their live performance wasn't the greatest but is all that hate necessary over some arbitrary award?

So why are people in kpop so caught up with awards and shit? Unlike sports where you're literally competing against other teams to win, music isn't something to compete against. How are you to say that 1 song is objectively better than another? There are so many musicians and songs in the world, for every artist, band, group or song you know there are 100 others you don't know about. Are you to say that the ""song of the year"" is better than EVERY OTHER SONG out there? That's ridiculous. Who cares if this song won song of the year, music awards have always been a popularity contest and always will be. The #1 song in the ranking or whatever doesn't necessarily mean it's better than #2 and #2 doesn't mean it's better than #3. Does this song winning the award stop you from enjoying your other favorite groups, I don't get it. It's a meaningless award that holds no real merit and people should stop caring about it. Just listen to whatever music you like and stop being so snobby about it.

Maybe I just don't get it, coming from a metal community none of give a shit about this kind of stuff. We just listen to whatever we like and enjoy it. We don't care about getting the latest music video of our favorite band to x amount of views or desperately voting our favorite song to win the song of the year award. Actually no, we do have official and fun community contests every now and then and some fans do go crazy about this kind of stuff but nothing to the seriousness of kpop. Is this what they call culture shock?

I was thinking about how groups like Stellar are so loved on this sub while so ignored in Korea. A lot of groups that aren't too popular yet in Korea are really praised here too, like WJSN. 

I mean I like both Stellar and WJSN but I frequent this sub and kpop Twitter. 

My guess is that they treat kpop as we treat American pop and just listen to it on the radio.

What's your opinion on this?

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikiepedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

~~Headed out so will have to edit later; will post my experience.~~ In the meantime, feel free to ask questions about the auditioning process, song choices, Cube building. 


**EDIT:**
Proof: [My audition sticker](http://imgur.com/a0Ijw9n)


I'm a Korean-American female born in 1993 (23 US, 25 Korean). I've been in Korea for about 7 weeks now; came to visit family for the first time in 15 years and figured that I might as well audition to see what the process is about. I had initially planned to audition for JYPE but they cancelled their monthly auditions for January and February because of their 13th? annual JYP auditions. 

I went into the audition knowing that chances of me passing the first round were almost nonexistent due to my age. I arrived at Cube Entertainment (they have 4 dates this month but only today was in Seoul at their training facility) which is located off of Sungsu Station, exit 1. I got there early, a little after 10am, and there was already a small line. Doors were scheduled to open at 11am and there were about 100 people by the time staff members let us in at 10:45. You can see Cube's cafe - named 20 Space - and we were ushered into the stairwell to the second floor which is where the training center is located. We waited about 15-20 more minutes in the stairwell before they passed out audition numbers and had us gather into the training room. There are two training rooms: [the first training room where the audition was](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eMbimVO9gEM/maxresdefault.jpg) and a second training room where we waited (cannot find a picture of it but searching - it has dark grey walls). While waiting, they had us fill out a chart with our names, where we're from, phone number, date of birth, height/weight, and category. They only let us audition for one category out of dance/rap/vocal/acting/model. Several kids wrote two and were asked by staff to pick one. 

During this waiting time, Cube artist songs were playing and staff members said that we were to enter in groups of 10, stand behind the line, had 30 seconds each to perform when the camera was put on us and that no introduction is necessary. Dancers were told to tell the judge that they're going to dance and would perform in a freestyle group after everyone else. They had a small random drawing to see who would win a signed CubeStar Audition poster - #77 won. The first group went in - there was a guy who brought a guitar, the second group was told to get ready, etc. 

Inside the actual audition room, there was a camera person and a single judge sitting at a table. The judge repeated the same directions as before and then started filming. No feedback from the judge other than her keeping time and jotting notes. In my group of 10, 9 were female: 2 dancers, 7 vocals. The one guy rapped. Auditions were decent - nothing spectacular that made me feel like they were definitely passing the first round and from what I could see, no one was super young either (from the charts they made us fill out, I saw several 2003-2006 babies ;_;). Everyone sang Korean songs but not pop; the closest was one girl who sang Lee Hi's Breathe. Most forgot lyrics of varying extent. I sang Bolbbalgan4's Galaxy but forgot the last line of my verse while the worst 2-3 others forgot like half of their song. The rapper forgot his lyrics but went straight into freestyle. From what I remember, every vocalist except one had a warmer tone. The second girl had a really bright, high tone. The 2 dancers were told to step forward and freestyle. I can't remember what song they played but it was American pop. Both were decent but nothing special; it was very generic freestyling with mostly body waves. I didn't see a lot of technical stuff. 

After all 10 performed, they said thanks for coming to audition and only those who passed would be contacted in 2 weeks at the earliest, 1 month at the latest. We left the room and exited the building. Outside, there was still a line waiting to go in. The entire auditioning process took about an hour from the time the doors opened. Auditions were from 11am-4pm

I didn't see any idols but there were several celebrity vans parked outside. They had about 4 female staff members ushering the line. Didn't see any male staff. ",47,95,False,self,,,,,

Take a listen and feel free to suggest some songs in the comments section!

---

[Indie Pop] [Art Effects - Give Me Love](https://youtu.be/221CBA1yyw0)
&gt; While the band in Finnish, they took inspiration from the Korean Indie scene that they experienced while travelling the country (they're even touring in Korea now!). The catchy guitar parts characteristic of Scandinavian Indie acts (eg. Satellite Stories, The Royal Concept, etc) mixed with synthesizer will get this song stuck in your head for a week. - /u/Nokel

[Chill Electronic] [Aseul - Elephants Mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TfuWTgLm10)
&gt; The dream pop artist [Yukari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ) reinvented herself this year and released an Electro Pop album under a new name. 'Elephant Mobile' is one of my favorite tracks on her album - titled 'New Pop' - because I feel it most closely resembles her 'Yukari' roots (ie. soft vocals over an instrumental that you can get lost in). - /u/Nokel

[Rock] [Fantastic Drugstore - Scarlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p59AA1fNsPQ)
&gt; Smooth (and I mean smoooooooooooooooooooooooth) vocals coupled with an even smoother instrumental. What's not to like? You'll fall in love with this song as soon as you hear the falsetto in the chorus.

[Trap/Hip Hop] [Futuristic Swaver - Gu Jun Pyo](https://youtu.be/2FgtRdnuxow)
&gt; 'Gu Jun Pyo' is a huge departure from Futuristic Swaver's previous works, which were mainly cloud trap or low-tempo hip hop. Swaver's flow is on point in this song and the instrumental (produced by the talented laptopboy) just makes me want to jump around. It was released on Christmas Day and immediately jumped into my Top 5 songs of the year list. - /u/Nokel

[Alt Rock] [\(Hyukoh\) -  \(MASITNONSOUL\)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AlSZddhXBM)
&gt; This was a soundtrack for a Korean TV show. I've been waiting for Hyukoh's new song, so I checked it out. It's up-beat song with catchy base~~? guitar?~~ line. If you know Hyukoh, it sounds nothing like what they've been doing (except a song they released in the show called Infinite Challenge), but it's still good. - /u/Lost_first_username

[Instrumental/Atmospheric] [Roy C. - ](https://youtu.be/F3hB9LqVzHY)
&gt; This is the most relaxing track I heard in 2016. Perfect to zone out to, much like the songs from one of my other favorite artists [Doxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO1tZkCfhf4) (who unfortunately hasn't released anything in three years). Let me know if you know of any other songs that have been produced by Roy C, since I haven't been able to find much more from him. - /u/Nokel

[Funk/RnB/Hip Hop] [Samuel Seo - B L U E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LCT1HU0KPI)
&gt; Samuel Seo is very hit or miss with me, but when he 'hits' he knocks it out of the park. Produced and arranged by Seo himself, B L U E showcases his talents as a 'total package' artist and cements his standing as one to watch for over the next few years. He has a pretty unique sound and combines Hip Hop and RnB in a way that's really interesting to listen to. - /u/Nokel

[Ballad/Electronic] [Singer/Songwriter Gingee - Meow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdtX1IBflUI)
&gt; Best artist in Korea at the moment? I think so! Gingee released her debut song [The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gF7vgqCtys) back in January of this year and Meow, her second release, is just as good! Her voice is AMAZING! Just a week ago she released an unfinished demo track called [Narara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UIpxA5GK3U) and it sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. She's definitely one to keep an eye on for the future. - /u/Nokel

[Alt Rock/Pop] [ \(Stella Jang\) -  \(Transfer\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4g1_R1ucuw)
&gt;In the music video, there's this part Jamez and she dance. I loved that scene and watched the m/v couple times just for that and eventually got addicted to the song. It's a cute song. She compared transfering between the lines in subway to breaking up with someone. I thought that was pretty clever... Also she raps^just-a-bit which is pretty cool. - /u/Lost_first_username

[Indie/Spacey] [Stellarjet - Guiding Light](https://youtu.be/EORGbefYcEU)
&gt; This song is something else. The instrumental is kind of psychedelic/distorted which I have never heard in another Korean song. Also, the drummer fucking kills it. - /u/Nokel

[Rock/Electronic] [Sugardonut - Imagine, Close Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOFiVKnRIds)
&gt; As a YouTube commenter put it, this song is ""like a musical skydive."". The structure of this song is all about building anticipation for the booming chorus, and I have to say it's masterfully done. - /u/Nokel

[Post-Rock] [   (They Keep Silence) -  (Jambinai)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB1k7CDVWVk)
&gt; The song is about the Sewol ferry tragedy and is haunting as fuck. Plus, any band that can combine traditional Korean instruments into modern music needs more attention. This song is particular was included in NPR's 100 best songs of 2016 for its sound and significance. - /u/BloosCorn

[Electronic/Dance] [We Are The Night - BRother](https://youtu.be/VMqUxobOCIM)
&gt; This is a chill dance track that I can't help but bob my head to. The singer has a really unique voice. - /u/Nokel

[Indie Rock] [we hate jh - ](https://youtu.be/cx9wPZchZUM)
&gt; Bands that make the instruments just as important as the vocals are my favorite - and we hate jh are the perfect example of that. This is one of my most played songs of 2016. - /u/Nokel

591,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-1-8,2017,1,8,10,5mo384,self.kpop,Fan Acc of Zico's concert in London,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5mo384/fan_acc_of_zicos_concert_in_london/,Nanoshiima,1483837427,"Eventually got to a laptop to type this haha. Gonna add a necessary disclaimer here: **Zico was completely fantastic. It was the awful planning that let it down.**  Long para following, haven't proof read as it's 1am lol, small details about when the speaking segments were may be in the wrong place as this happened Thurs night, it's Sun 1am and I went to 24k's concert Fri night so my brain is a muddle haha. 
  
--  
 
Me and my friend entered at around 8:30. The venue building itself (Koko) was awesome. Quite a lot of space left where everyone was standing together near the stage, but there were small standing places outside of the pit that still provided a great view, and were less crowded for those who didn't like the crowd aspect. There was also a balcony, which I believe those concert goers whom had disabilities were sat (and from what I've read, had a fantastic experience).  
  
DJ had been playing for a while (me and my friend were I'd say in the last 50 to enter the building), playing typical club tunes but there was the odd kpop song mixed in (Zutter by GD+TOP is one I can remember.) The organisers running the concert were 'Cult of Ya' who had done Crush's concerts in London too. Pretty sure the DJ is the same guy who was DJ'ing at Crush's concert.  
  
There was a group of, idk, 6 or 7 people towards the right side of the stage. Tbh, I had thought they were there for backstage press stuff, but as you'll read in a bit, nope.  
  
The schedule as promoted on the FB page was: 9PM: Opening Artist, 9:30PM: Zico (Live) + Millic. Just before 9PM, Keith Ape's It G Ma played, and us in the crowd are like ""is he the opening act? YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"". Turns out the DJ played that to get us hyped. One of the people standing to the right side of the stage comes out, introduces himself to the crowd, he's like a rapper from England. Okey dokey yo.  
  
I'll give it to him, the first two songs that he did (lasted 3:30 for both or so i'd say) got the crowd hyped. Then a sad song about his breakup, crowd waved their phones with flashlights on blah blah. Then the crowd got bored. This guy started the odd sentence with 'well, this is the England way of doing things' which rubbed quite a bit of the crowd up the wrong way. The guy then called one of his friends on stage, crowd barely reacted to this new guys songs. I think I heard four cheers and that was it. More songs followed, crowd started to get restless. Original DJ got joined by someone else from the friend group, who tried to get the crowd going but ended up shouting over the other guys and getting kinda aggressive that the crowd wasn't providing a great reaction.  
 
The opening act finished at around 9:40, overrunning by 10mins. Millic comes on stage until 10:07pm. I'd say the crowd's response was pretty good (fans of Millic, people who liked the tunes he was playing, or people who were hyped because the opening acts were gone.) Others got restless as time was kinda running out.  
  
Zico now comes on stage, and the crowd goes absolutely nuts. His first song is Tough Cookie, people chanting left right and centre. Well Done follows, and then V-V-V (crowd goes mental.) I think at this point Zico has his first talking segment to the crowd (all in English, I must add - it was either after Well Done or V-V-V.) I believe it was after V-V-V as Zico mentioned Crush and DEAN (uh oh), crowd goes mental thinking they're here. Nope, Zico asks the crowd to cover their parts for Bermuda Triangle (Zico also live covered parts, and gosh, him covering Crush's lines was fantastic.)  
  
Turtle Ship follows, and then Okey Dokey. Before Okey Dokey played, Zico asked the crowd who they preferred, him or Mino. A lot of the crowd shouted Mino. (Sigh). I think it was during Okey Dokey, Zico went and stood directly infront of the crowd and sung. This is where the horrible side of fans comes in. I get that people are hyped because idol right there!!!, but someone knocked off Zico's hat, and from where I was standing (this must have been like... 50m away?) you could clearly see two people running their hands through his hair and touching his face. Disgusting.    
  
Three more songs followed, You Are Me - I Am You (which was amazing live), Boys &amp; Girls (crowd chanted Babylon's lines), and Eureka. Somewhere in between these songs, the crowd got told that the concert was almost at an end. Crowd got restless, as by that point, Zico had been performing for like 25 to 30mins. Zico took a photo with the crowd (the opening acts joined too), went off stage, came back to perform what we found out to be the last song - Yes or No. Crowd went mental, Zico said his thanks and then went off the stage.  
  
By this point, it wasn't even 10:45pm, (I'd say it was like 10:43), so Zico had been on stage for 35mins. That was it. The crowd was unsure whether we had been trolled and Zico would come back for another encore, but nope, two people came on stage proclaiming about the afterparty. So many of the crowd, including myself, made a quick exit.  
  
So? Overall. Zico was so amazing live, and I'd love to see him again. The concert planning was absolutely atrocious, especially with how the concert was advertised as a Zico concert, but the opening acts performed slightly longer than Zico himself. Many people in the concert group, and on Twitter made their complaints vocal, and whilst Cult of Ya did the Crush concerts that did have faults, I'd say the Crush concerts went so much better compared to the Zico one in terms of concert management. A lot of people travelled to the concert from elsewhere in Europe, and were unhappy that Zico was on stage for just barely 35mins.

In almost every video featuring a ""main"" dancer and another member people are always so quick to say "" (Insert Main Dancer) was so much better they were so natural and blah blah"" even when that isn't always the case. Truth is, a lot of group members, especially these days, are just as good perhaps even better (depending on who you ask) than the labeled main dancer. It's been something I've noticed for a while but come to my attention in comment section of [DIA's Cathy and Eunjin's cover to Playing With Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCeF_bkYHDw). So many people were saying things like Cathy is trying too hard, Eunjin looks so much more natural and what not. And as me, someone watching it objectively Cathy looked the closest to BP members in terms of the execution, it was essentially flawless. And she didn't look robotic or ""unnatural"" either, that's just the way she dances. But I think a lot of people don't wanna hear that because shes not called the main dancer. And to reference another group, in Seventeen Woozi isn't part of the performance unit, but he's one of the best dancers in the entire group, and so is Vernon if you watch some of the pre debut videos. In fact, all of them are pretty good. It's interesting because you could probably show a dance practice video to a non-kpop fan who doesn't know anyone in the group and ask them who they think is best, and any name can come up because they don't live in the label generated world of ""main"" this and that. And this is not to downgrade the talent of main dancers, but more people need to realize that main does not NECESSARILY = best or better. Sorry bout the rant, just annoys me :/",21,0,False,self,,,,,

679,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-1-9,2017,1,9,14,5mvu0z,self.kpop,[Discussion] Which Songs Do You Listen to for a Certain Member?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5mvu0z/discussion_which_songs_do_you_listen_to_for_a/,bluemysteric,1483938751,"I feel like there was probably a thread or two recently about songs where one's bias sounds best in, but I wanted to get a thread up about songs that you listen to for a member in particular. The member doesn't have to be your bias, the song doesn't have to be a masterpiece, and the part the member has doesn't have to be some big thing. It's just a song you enjoy especially because a member has That Part in it.

I got my examples:

**f(x)**

* Victoria  ""[Deja Vu](https://youtu.be/fmpE8b6hkHc?t=46)"", the ""  /   Gentleman"" and ""  /  "" pre-choruses just because her voice is adorable.
* Amber  ""[4 Walls](https://youtu.be/4j7Umwfx60Q?t=60)"", Amber's had some corny rap verses in the past, I won't lie, but this rap right here is her breakout. She's by no means some genius rapper all of a sudden because of it, but it's a good start. I love the flow, the pronunciation, the 4 WALLS/NEW WALLS/NEW WORLD, everything.
* Luna  ""[Ice Cream](https://youtu.be/TYOLfl60iqE?t=49)"", I feel like if you've heard this song before you know exactly what Luna part I'm talking about but I linked it anyway. I just love the sound of that note; I can't really describe my feelings for it. It just feels right.
* Krystal  ""[Rum Pum Pum Pum](https://youtu.be/xnku4o3tRB4?t=104)"", Krystal was the closest in age to the story theme for Pink Tape, so she really captures the mature-but-not-just-yet vibe they're going for in RPPP. And this truly iconic part shows off that youth but also a subtle sensuality. Best believe in a concert I'll be yelling that part loud and clear.

**Others that spring to mind immediately**

* Jonghyun  ""[Hold You](https://youtu.be/u3yKY6z17XE?t=210)"", he shines (ahem) in the whole damn song honestly, but my favorite part is that ending ""Oooooooh~""
* Jaehyun/Doyoung  ""[The 7th Sense](https://youtu.be/3UGMDJ9kZCA?t=69)"", I'll always hype Mark up in this song, but I also get so excited when this verse comes up because it has so many emotions in it: anxious, panicky, dreamy, tired, strong, and a bit of confused as well? It's a lot from both of them in that one bit, and I love that it goes with the theme of the song.
* V  ""[Dead Leaves](https://youtu.be/Z-DdQUszwoc?t=175)"", look I will run up and down the streets yelling about this song for days to come, and it is SOOO difficult picking just one part to call a favorite, but I will highlight V's part just because, much like Jaehyun and Doyoung, there are a lot of emotions to unpack in just his voice, never mind if you understand the lyrics and the entire song. I also wanna shout-out [Jimin's yell/adlib](https://youtu.be/Z-DdQUszwoc?t=230) that sounds like pure agony; it almost made me cry once when I was focusing on the song too much and it just seeped into my feelings.
* Chen  ""[Artificial Love](https://youtu.be/ts_x8wjrs4E?t=169)"", the energy in this song lowers during the ""Love, love, oh"" part right before this, then Sehun's like ""You thought it was cooling down eh? LISTEN UP"" and then Chen's booming voice comes in to hype you the hell back up. I also love his little [scatting](https://youtu.be/ts_x8wjrs4E?t=201) soon after.
* Hani  ""[Of Course](https://youtu.be/7Ieys21mk2w?t=158)"", I kind of ignore this song because I am smitten with ""I Know"" but whenever I listen to it, I'm always there for this little jazzy bit from Hani's voice which fits perfectly. LE really did a good job with their voices in all the songs she [co-]composed.

I could be here all night, but these are some examples, especially if I didn't write the point of this thread that clearly lol. Your turn!",88,80,False,self,,,,,
680,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-1-9,2017,1,9,14,5mvvq2,self.kpop,[Discussion] Unexpected/under appreciated songs on best-of 2016 lists?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5mvvq2/discussion_unexpectedunder_appreciated_songs_on/,smileyman,1483939375,"One of the things I like to do at the end of each year is look at various ""Best of"" lists to see how much I agree or disagree, and also to see any songs that I might have missed, or that I have but nobody else does.

So in this thread I'd love to know the following:

A) Songs that you're surprised weren't on more year-end lists. These are songs that are otherwise fairly well known and popular but didn't end up on very many lists for whatever reason.

I offer up Sistar's [One Day More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4TygUpWUTQ) which was a top 5 track last year for me, and Infinite's [The Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmhca-ROWwQ). The ""whoas"" on One More Day just kill me, and I think the chorus on The Eye is stunningly beautiful.

B) Songs which should be in best of lists but aren't due to not being very well known. 

I offer up Mamamoo's [Words Don't Come Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc2bfEYNY7w) which might be my favorite song that they've done this year, and Bolbbalgan4's [Tell Me You Love Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUIBACYi0-8) (though really just about any song from that album would work, that's how amazing it is).

C) Songs which you were introduced to because of other people's best of lists and which blow you away. 

I offer up Jin Ju Hyun's [Breaking Through the Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8SWxZT4I8) and Michelle Lee's [Queenz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXWkEIAQNIQ)",76,52,False,self,,,,,

______________________

I am doing a general survey of the K-POP community to see if there are any interesting results or trends among people who are K-POP fans. I'm sure many of you would also be interested :).

The survey is wholly anonymous, and this survey is entirely for the fun of it. The questions range from questions about KPOP itself to other general demographic questions.

* *No questions are required; feel free to skip any question you do not feel comfortable answering.*

* *Please only answer the survey once!* 

I'm excited to see the data and will post it here! 

**Edit:** Oops... I broke the data on mathematics majors :(. The count restarted from 0 as of 600-700 responses.

**FAQ**

- **Q. Why isn't Navillera or [Song Title] on Spotify yet?**

It all depends on the label if they want to release their content to Spotify. Navillera for example is outed because SourceMusic doesn't see any benefit for releasing on the Spotify platform, even with the LOEN deal. 

- **Q. Where's all the JYP music?**

Currently region locked to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. 

- **Q. Why are songs region locked?**

Some songs are region locked due to exclusivity deals. For example, BTS's Young Forever is still unavailable in the United States due to Apple Music grabbing an exclusive streaming deal with BigHit. Some are region locked because the label just wants it to be available to certain countries, case and point with APink's new album 'Dear' only being available in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Phillipines, Australia and New Zealand.",15,44,False,self,,,,,

They were all okay but not my thing.

Second recording had WJSN, VROMANCE, Beatwin, and BP Rania. WJSN were really short and they all looked like high schoolers (I was shook). Exy was the mainly the only one talking to the audience and got in trouble cause she was too distracted.

The group I came for was BP Rania and was super excited to see Alex. I wanted to cheer for them while they performed but I don't believe they have fan-chants with their songs. While they were performing, it was the time that Alex had to walk off the stage and let the other members dance. I was so lucky to be able to sit on the side that Alex constantly walked to (they performed like 4 times). Each and every time I was able to talk to Alex and she was really nice! I asked if she was able to give autographs and she said she did, but I had nothing for her to sign so I asked her to sign my [1,000 won bill](http://imgur.com/a/WQ5x1). I then asked her if she is allowed to take pictures with us, and she said [yes!!!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPELrXMluEH/?taken-by=fromtyrone) She was constantly talking to the audience unlike the other idols that performed that day.

While the rest of BP Rania was on stage and Alex was standing on the side, Alex was constantly dancing as well to the whole routine. Meaning, she knows the whole dance of the title song and is able to dance but the company isn't letting her perform for some reason. 

Sorry this fan account is so short, I just like BP Rania a lot.

EDIT : I accidentally spent the 1,000 won Alex signed fml",17,94,False,self,,,,,

I understand that this question may not have a direct answer because kpop itself is not a genre but rather an umbrella term for popular music. E.g. Very Very Very, Fxxkit and OOTN are all considered kpop releases despite not necessarily being of the same genre. As a whole pop is very fluid and difficult to really pinpoint/ make clear guidelines for. 

That being said, there are still artist/groups that most can agree are simply not kpop e.g. Skull &amp; Haha and that's what brought this question about.

My question, mainly, refers to two groups of people. The first being idols that have chosen to venture out and release more genre specific music e.g. MOBB/Zico/ Jay Park and the second being artists who feature in a fair amount of songs in the kpop sphere and release music that's fairly similar sounding to quite a few groups out there e.g. Anda, Dean, Crush etc

What makes something kpop? Is it the presence of an idol? Whether or not its mainstream sounding? Whether or not the artist switches between genres constantly? Promotion? Variety? Being in the kpop sphere?

This post was originally posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5n9hbf/hey_wlw_rkpop_community_survey_for_lesbians/), but after speaking with a mod to resolve the removed issue I got permission to repost it! If you've already taken the survey your results are still saved. 

[In this wonderful community survey posted recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5mz0rt/rkpop_community_survey_questionnaire/), a few comments wanted a WLW/gay survey to see what's up with the percent of WLW on here! I'm sorry the small gay male/gender minorities on /r/kpop, this one's moreso for women. :( If there's interest I'll conduct another survey asking these questions for the other gay parts of this community!


This is just a general survey, like the other one, to see the trends and correlation between queer kpop women and if we have any common interests, groups, etc. Feel free to ignore this post or not answer any questions while taking it!


But! Please only take this once and try and follow the instructions so our data is wholesome and easy to talk about. Plus, then we can decide the **Juicy Lesbian Awards** for who the most sapphicly loved idols are. I'll come back and decide who wins this 2017 Survey's JLA's on the *31st of January*. ^I ^doubt ^we'll ^need ^that ^long.


Here is a link to the survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexzEOAClK-nvxUQ3qJYBS7GCPuvyHQDAZODgJM3_JYo4KAOQ/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1


Thank you mods for helping me! r/kpop is the best. 

 I'm sorry to everyone if there's any typos! Sorry if you were excluded, you can still look over the survey but please try not to respond! I really want some community solidarity between the queer minority of r/kpop. I had a lot of fun making this survey and I'm really interested in the discussion and results. After you finish the survey you can see the results, but I think if you click on this sheet you can see them any time! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-WEn-8LPYWi5S_wpHcANrpVhGWfSqZqbozwaFGWK7Bc/viewanalytics

Thank you so much everyone! I really enjoyed making this survey.",26,44,False,self,,,,,

With the departure of Yina at that time and then the abandonment of Jooyi, the rest of the group decided to take a hiatus to find new members, and so over time Hyeme, Ziu (Seulji) and Alex joined the group to start a new project that would be the song Demonstrate; That's when Dr Music appoints Di to group leader. 

Unfortunately during the audio and video recordings of Demonstrate, the relationship between the three old members with the three new members was not particularly positive, especially with Alex.  Being that she was the only Western member who tried to join the group. Hyeme and Zi.U had  a good relationship with Alex, therefore the division of the group during the promotion of Demonstrate was created.

Now, what actually happened with T-ae, Di and Xia to make them leave RaNia?
Going back to the previous thing Dr Music mentioned that T-ae and Di had verbally attacked Alex in every aspect from her skin color to her talent as a rapper.  This led to Dr Music firing T-ae and Di for said behavior.  Alex and Hyeme also asked for them to leave. This was not asked of Xia, who decided to leave voluntarily. 

After this hard moment T-ae, Di and Xia made the decision to form a trio. This is why Ela8te under the company Hama Entertaiment. There the company makes the decision to appoint T-ae as leader, so she proposes to the company that they use their real names instead of their artistic names. Having already been working with the company, the three members decided to delete all of their photographs with RaNia basically starting over new. Unfortunately when Hama Entertaiment already had already given them a debut date. T-ae decides not to continue with the group, along with the others as they did not want competition with their former group(RaNia).

We have all been following K-Pop for about 5-6 years and enjoy listening to podcast but didn't think there was very much out there in terms of regular conversational podcasts about K-Pop. Please check us out if you are interested as we are new to podcasting and looking for constructive feedback to improve the show.  
  
The format of the podcast will be 4 topics, 1 brought by each person and 1 chosen ahead of time as a group. Each topic will be posted daily Monday through Thursday on our Youtube channel and then Friday the full show will be posted. For the first episode our topics include how we got into K-Pop, K-Pop generations, groups that disbanded or lost members in 2016, and our top 50 MV's of 2016 (sorry for the glaring omissions, we made it a little early).  
  
We are obviously small and for such a niche podcasting topic, it won't be easy to grow so we would love all the help we could get. If you are interested sub to the youtube channel and follow us [here on twitter.](https://twitter.com/DaebakCast)

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

Music Core NCT 127 Prerec,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5nwuzq/fan_account_170114_show_music_core_nct_127_prerec/,jolaurence,1484390014,"WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE is how I can sum up this day. Once again, the notices for both MuCore and Inki went up Friday during week. I sprinted out of work and ran to the subway station that is five minutes away (and fell up the escalator in the process because fangirl pain is real) and an hour later got to MBC and found the notice. I got my check in number right away and my heart sank a little but I still had hope. My check in number was 573, higher than I was last weekend. But last weekend I was going in as N5 and this weekend I was going in as N1. I HAD HOPE OKAY? [Then I took a taxi over to Inki and found the notice and got my check in number which is 135. Inki has a very small number on Sunday so I really dont have any hope on getting in. But I did get into Inki last weekend for the postrec and that will be posted on Sunday or Monday some time.]

I arrived at MBC World [because literally MBC has an entire block in the DMC area and it is beautiful], got some breakfast and waited for check in. Check in time was 9 am but since this is SM, that means check in starts when we want it to. They started calling for numbers around 7:50 am and I got in my 451~end line. Side note: I have been practicing my Korean numbers this week and it paid off. I just didnt want another repeat of what happened to me last Sunday to happen again [that account will be up Sunday]. After check in finished, we waited outside and then heard an announcement that we were going inside since IT WAS COLDER THAN MOLASSES OUTSIDE. I, a proud Wisconsinite, am admitting that it is cold outside. We went to the building next to where MuCore films and stayed in our lines. Thank you MBC for letting us wait inside. 

We were moving around constantly. We got into one big line, then smaller lines, then even smaller lines, and thought we were done. Oh no. We went back outside again to redo the lines but somehow the lines got muddled together. So we spent a good ten minutes back inside trying to solve the problem. It all worked in the end. After Line Confusion, they started checking and seeing what we had for our tiers. Im N1 which means I have my photo id card [I use my ARC, Alien Registration Card], fan card [I got what is now the old fan card last weekend and I got the new one today after the recording], Limitless cd, and Limitless sound source from one of the streaming sites [YOU MUST PRINT THIS OFF AS WELL AS YOUR PROFILE PAGE]. Those who are N1 standing are the ones who have the first 100 numbers really. Those are the blessed ones. One day I will be there. ONE DAY. After they gave us our tiers, they went through the lines again and gave us our official line numbers. I was 381 which isnt a bad number at all really. They started calling for N1s and most of the people I was around left with me. We put ourselves in order as best we could before fan support came to double check. One of the ladies started going through the fan cards but ran out of time because we were moving next door. 

I got next door and they led us over to the stairs in between the seats. We sat in for the prerecord of , Baros little sister ahhhhh! SHE IS ADORABLE! It was her first MuCore and they had her fans in the front of area with the N1 standings. We packed the place again. I have no idea if everyone got in again or not. As s fans were leaving something happened and staff told all of standing to leave. The boys came out and looked confused at why no one was standing. Everyone was sitting instead. I have no idea why staff told them to leave. Later lines got put into standing [and I was put into standing as well so I really am not complaining] and some of standing came back. It was a confusion. 

For the first recording [where there was no standing], the boys all wore these big name tags on their clothes. They all looked really good today. After the first recording, they left the stage and took those off. That was when some of standing was let back in and then they started bringing some of us sitting on the floor and stairs down there. As this was happening, everyone was wondering what was even happening. The security man walked to my section and told us to get up. Since I do what I am told, I got up and started walking down. Now, the room was dark because they had it ready for filming and how MuCore works you can see the artists enter and exit if you sit near the far left. They were waiting there as we got settled. As I was walking down I was dancing to the playback when I saw that Johnny was looking at me. [Whatmakesyouhaha.mp3] I know he has seen me before. He saw me on Sunday at Inki since I was standing for that one as well. Look, he has seen me before, okay? I WANT TO BELIEVE. 

I found center and stood there. Naturally, I was focusing a lot on Johnny, but I found myself focusing on the group as a whole as well. The more I see them perform, the more I am noticing little things like the motion they do with their hands when it is Jaehyuns part. SO. GOOD. HERES JAEHYUN! Speaking of Jaehyun

**Member time:**

**Jaehyun:** HOLY MOTHER OF. HOLY. I. OH MY GOD. VISUAL KING. KING OF VISUALS. He was stunning today and I mean stunning. He may or may not be my bias wrecker for NCT as a whole. He was just so stunning and I was left speechless. Also, everything about him gives me life.

**Mark:** All of us love Mark Lee. All of us. Everytime he danced, screams. Every time he sang, screams. He could be tying his shoe and we would be screaming. Marks middle name is talent I am sure of it. 

**Taeyong:** Im just gonna forever be captivated by his stage presence and charisma. I keep being drawn to him. Hes like this magnet. He just pulls you in and wont let you go. I dont know if I should feel scared or happy? Lee Taeyong does things to me. 

**Winwin:** I love this little ball of sunshine so much. So, so, so much. You can just tell that he puts everything into his performance. Im patiently waiting for the comeback that lets him use his background in traditional Chinese dance. WINWIN RISE!

**Haechan:** THIS LITTLE BUTTON NEEDS TO STOP BEING SO CUTE. For one of the recordings, he was the one they were waiting on. Hes so gosh darn adorable. I think everyone needs a Haechanie in their life. 

**Taeil:** MY BOY! Taeils vocals save lives, okay? They seriously do. They just do. His voice does things to me. I get chills. Im excited to see how his voice develops over the years as well. 

**Yuta:** Nakamoto Yuta. My sweet Oska Prince. Yuta stans, please control your man. Hes just wild. I am thankful every day that he woke up when he did and saw Tohoshinki on the TV. Without Tohoshinki there would be no Yuta in SM. 

**Doyoung:** You know. He is probably the second most popular member after Mark honestly. Everyone that I was around screamed whenever Doyoung did something. He is also one of the hardest working members in the group. He has a lot of solo activities going on [and if you have seen him in Makeup Prince, he literally is perfect at putting on makeup] but keeps such an upbeat attitude. He works so hard. THIS SWEET ANGEL. WE ARE NOT WORTHY OF YOU.

**Johnny:** Hes so tall. He was looking very confident today. His first week of promoting is over and now you can tell he is getting more comfortable. YAY! There were A LOT of screams for Johnny today, I HAVE FOUND MY PEOPLE. I have yet to find another person who is Johnny bias but I know they are there. He was wearing a Bulls jersey today underneath his long jacket and overalls, Chicago swag. Im just so happy to see that hes happy and when hes happy Im happy. After the finished their final recording, the members did their greeting and as Johnny left he gave us all the double peace sign. AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.

They finished and we filed out to the MBC building next door. We had to cut between the Changjos to get over there. We waited inside to get our new fan cards while those who were in the first 250 or so went outside towards where the notice is posted to get their posters. I got my new fan card and left super happy because today was better than I thought it would be. And as I was writing this for most of the afternoon, I literally kept myself busy before I found out if I got into the fan sign tomorrow night or not. I did. ",16,42,False,self,,,,,

I didnt make it into the morning prerec but made it into the afternoon postrec. I wasnt able to hear my number in the utter chaos so I lost my super close spot but I still got in for standing. I was in the back but we were all crowded to the front because why not. And holy shit. Like. Bless. BLESS. Everyone looked so good that day, even though they were tired. They had prerecord that morning and then performed Good Thing for the broadcast and then had postrec. The ended up filming it four times. I pretty much died every time Johnny did something. I AM SO WEAK.


**MEMBERS TALK:**


**Mark:**Screams were of course really loud for him because hes Mark Lee. He has a lot of fans and rightfully so because he has earned them. He works so hard in everything he does. There is a reason he is in all of the three units so far. Im so proud of my small Canadian child who is now gonna be on that high school rap show and YOU BETTER WIN IT ALL MARK!


**Haechan:** Stop being so goddamn adorable. Seriously this kid is killing me with his cuteness. Noona killer in the making. Hes so young. I want to protect him. PROTECT LEE DONGCHYUCK 2K17!


**Winwin:** He was in such a good mood that afternoon. He had a lot of fans as well and his smile is just too perfect. Light of my life Dong Sicheng. I also feel the great need to protect him. I dont know why but I just do.


**Yuta:** Damn son. Just damn. That stage presence. My god. Just. Wow. I am constantly impressed. Every day I am thankful that you saw Tohoshinki on TV. Every goddamn day.


**Doyoung:** MY DOYOUNGIE!!!!!!!!! So. Many. Doyoung. Stans. But it is also hard to hate him because if you hate him you just hate happiness and rainbows and sunshine. He deserves the whole world honestly. He was also the happiest little button but thats our Doyoungie.


**Jaehyun:** Stay in your lane boy. Stay there. But honestly, I never gave him much thought before but now and Im mad at myself for not seeing his talent sooner. I have failed myself.


**Taeil:** I will say this until the end of time really. Dont sleep on him folks. There is something about Taeil. I cant put my finger on it yet but he is gonna be something else. And Im so excited.


**Taeyong:** Goddamn. Goddamn. Goddamn. He just oozes charisma. I keep forgetting how young he is. Im so excited to see how he grows as a leader, rapper, artist, etc. The fact that the person who though the Big Three were SBS, KBS, and MBC and the person who literally controls the stage when he performs are the same person baffles me. Taeyong please.


**Johnny:** Im whipped. Like pretty much there is no one else in the world except for him. Lets just say I was having a bias list problem and Johnny won in the end. (Hello ultimate bias). Look. He wore a goddamn Phoenix Coyotes jersey from the 1990s for this stage. Now I know no one over here would know about that unless they religiously follow the NHL. My mouth dropped when I saw him come out wearing it because this further confirms my theory that John Suh is a hockey fan. Hockey is my sport. I am a hot mess. This is very important to me and I dont even know if I will recover from it.


Anyway, damn. I was standing in the middle and well it was pretty obvious you could see me. [I was the only white person there.] During the second recording he literally looked at me. R. I. P. I was literally the only Johnny stan in standing as well. There were a few others in the seated area and we all screamed when he had his part.


I know this is gonna be brought up eventually so Im bringing it up now. I havent seen any comments about this yet but someone will eventually say it. Johnnys face looks like he isnt having fun. Now we need to keep in mind that he just debuted. It takes a while to get familiar and comfortable with the cameras. Right now, he is focusing on not making mistakes.  In due time he wont be as obvious (if this even is the right word to use here. I dont even think it is) because he will literally be stealing everyones spotlight. I actually saw that during the fourth recording when they had the members look at a different camera for camera reactions or something like that. During Johnnys part, the look he gave the camera. Oh my god. You just debuted. I am not ready for that eye sexing.
[Writer's note: I was right. The comments about Johnny have begun. Gonna be on the defensive as usual.]

Honestly I could go on and on about Johnny. I could write an entire essay about Johnny and how he makes me feel. THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A ULTIMATE BIAS. I HAD HIM PEGGED TO BE NUMBER THREE WHEN HE DEBUTED AND HERE HE IS NUMBER 1, MY ULTIMATE BIAS, THE PERSON THAT LITERALLY HAS ME KEPT AND WHIPPED AND I JUST DONT EVEN KNOW ANYMORE. PRAY FOR MY SOUL IF I EVER GET TO MEET HIM. PRAY FOR ME. [Author's note: at the time of writing this I had no idea about the fan sign. Sure enough a fan sign was announced and I got in and I am meeting him today. Pray for me.]

When they finished, the lights went up and they gave us their greeting again and TY tried to tell us something. One of the Inki people ran up with a mic and each member introduced themselves. Yes, I screamed when Johnny introduced himself. After each member spoke, they did their greeting again for us and left. Im just really happy I got to see Johnny during his debut weekend. By the end of the weekend, I literally fell in love with NCT as well. I love these boys a lot and I am gonna support and protect them till the end of time.

1213,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-1-15,2017,1,15,16,5o2ocj,self.kpop,"[Fan Account] 24K 'Still With 24U' Concert in Bucharest, Romania",https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5o2ocj/fan_account_24k_still_with_24u_concert_in/,ralah,1484464116,"I've been a Kpop fan since 2011 and this is my first concert experience with 24K in Romania. First I have to say that I didn't know much about the group, I knew that they had some great songs but I didn't know the names of all members and even though I had a VIP ticket (I specifically told my parents I wanted seat 10 or up for my birthday but they replied with 'we brought you VIP because you are a VIP in our eyes and the price was just 67Euro'). So I came thinking that I might not even go to the meet and greet because I have anxiety and I didn't want to make them feel awkward by coming bare-handed.

 The venue wasn't easy to find because Google Maps led me to a location 500m away from the concert hall and I spend about an hour desperately running the street up and down thinking that I would miss the concert because I couldn't find the number of the house. I finally made it 30minutes before the start of the show. There were booths that sold posters (signed ones for 30lei aka 5,50Euro, unsigned ones for 5lei, about one Euro  surprisingly low) and other goods and I brought an unsigned poster, relieved that apparently in the end I still got a way to get something signed. I waited for a few minutes and the doors to the concert hall opened about 18:45, 15minutes before the concert. The weird thing was, no one checked for my ticket. I could have been coming without a ticket and would have had no trouble getting in or even standing right in front of the stage.

Then the concert started. First of all, I don't know what I've been expecting, but they all had insanely good proportions.  They weren't that tall (I was in the sixth row so I can't say for sure but I thought they looked all in the 170-179 range, leaning more towards 170) but their faces were really small in comparation to the rest of their bodies and their shoulder-hips ratio was perfect, especially the visual one (though they were all on the smaller/lither-framed side). I wondered how their agency found so many guys with really good proportions though they were so small. They were slim but didn't look skin-and-bones. The most fitting description would be that they had model-esque builds only without model-esque tallness. 

I didn't recognize the first song but the second one was Oasis, my favorite B-side track. The standout was Cory. At the beginning of the concert the girl next to me asked me who my bias was and I said Cory, thinking that he'd be the one I was most likely to recognize. Cue to the concert start and I find myself thinking that two of them look like Cory and I won't be able to put a name to the face of any of the boys. The next moment their visuals hit me hard and I'm already swooning. For those of you who haven't seen a Kpop group live yet, the synchronisation and the quickness/fluidity of the  dance moves (at least in this caze) are absolutely mesmerizing in the first minutes. Looks way more impressive live than on screen.

The first talking segment is the introduction and the crowd is cheering super-hard whenever a member speaks up. During, I think, Kisu's turn, Cory asked us why we were shouting after he (Kisu) was speaking since he was pretty sure that we don't know Korean. Then we shut up whenever the other members talked.

 Hui (?) said he hoped the snow would substide once the concert was finished. When Changsun(?) was beginning his speech, someone shouted 'I love you' to which he replied 'I love you too'. Two members started with 'Buna Seara', the Romanian greeting &lt;3

I'm a person who hates body rolls and overly sexual dance moves in boy groups but halfway through the concert I started noticing that I was choking whenever Cory rolled his hips (and he did it often). HOLY LORD JESUS that guy is a born performer. I googled 'facts about 24K' to get knowledge about the group and somewhere I read that Cory was the worst dancer of the group. BITCH FIGHT ME! That body rolls were a gift send from heaven and overall, he seemed like he was the most into the choreography. This doesn't mean that he was the best dancer (I don't know shit about dancing but he didn't have any solo dance parts), but his dancing during everything revolving hip movement came off as a tad more aggressive/exaggerated than the others. During one slower and less choreographed song he was the only one to mildly hip thrust during the chorus. He just came across as born for the stage, like he was absolutely into it and wanted the crowd to be into it, too. He was always moving and comparatively often at the center. I then knew I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.

After some more dancing they have a segment where they split into tree teams and dance the chorus of Bingo together. When Hui, Kisu and somebody else search for a participant from their left side of the stage, they ask the crowd who of them thinks that they are the prettiest in this room. Selected is a boy and one of the members (either Kisu or Sungho) spend the next segment talking about his beauty. At one point (one of them) even goes down on one knee in front of him and raises his hands as in a proposal! Turned out there is another girl on team right side who's far the better dancer though so Hui (80% sure it was him) goes to the right side in an attempt to change teams and (the other one, Kisu? Sungho? Somebody) pretends that they don't take them back. Cory then grounds him into the corner of the room with 'Stay!'.

After that came the subunit stages. First was Cory, Kisu, the visual guy and somebody else singing a midtempo song which I personally found pleasant but generic. Then there was the hip hop stage which was OMG ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS because there was Cory and someone else (probably someone who's name starts with J) and there was rapping, good rapping and the beat was good too and I became so pumped! It was something aggressive and Cory's expressions were to die for, and I thought perhaps I actually died and I didn't know it yet. At the end I was turning to the girl next to me who asked for my bias at the beginning because I couldn't contain my emotions and shouted 'Oh my god I love him! I absolutely love him!'

Then there was the dancing, it was 1 vs 1, and a third member was holding a sign with 'round 1' written on it. Changsun and another member were doing some awesome dancing/fighting moves and I would have been absolutely thrilled if the hip hop stage hadn't been right before it. Afterwards another member danced solo and was then joined by the both of them as kind of back up dancers.

 I'm not sure whether it was after these stages but there was also a segment where they said they'll be now playing songs that everyone knows from other artists. Well, first song starts playing and I don't know it  and it also doesn't look like anyone around me does. The chorus was entirely English (I think), I could barely make out the verses. Second song was 'bang bang bang' but it takes me till the chorus to realize it's not fxxk it. 

After the solos they had another talking segment where they brought a Romanian flag on stage. Fans (?) had apparently written '24K Romania' with sharpie on it and it turned out that the writing was wrong (when read from left to right, the colours blue and red from the flag were on the wrong sides, when the flag was correct, the writing wasn't). Cory seemed visibly bothered/concerned by it and mentioned something about 'not wanting to cause misunderstandings'. I think he was actually ranting for a bit. At a later point in the concert he also told a member who didn't 'get it' to turn the flag around so that it showed the 'true' color order. It kind of felt like he was worried about a witch hunt. We also made a photo with a big heart poze together.

After that talking segment 'Superfly' was played. Another one of my favorite moments of the concert was the unison shouting of 'YANANANAH! and 'I said follow me!' in/before the chorus. The choreography was super fly (forgive the bad pun). I was super pumped up, the people around me too and the group was dancing crazily.

After a couple more songs they said that this one would be the last (I went to other concerts and I loved that they didn't announce 'okay, five songs left' 'four songs left' every couple of minutes. Everyone was saying their goodbyes and I don't know, I somehow got really emotional. First one was Changsun. 

Cory was the fourth one, he said that he was actually supposed to go last and that it would probably confuse The Visual One that he's speaking now but he wanted to say that the whole tour and everything was just possible because of us, the fans (AWWWW!). I know that every group is supposed to say that and all but the way he said it I just found it incredibly touching. I was really anxious about showing up to the meet and greet without an album but at this point I was just like fxxk it, I'm definitely going and I tell them that this here made me become a fan. 

During this segment Changsun was sniffling often. His behaviour was playful and he didn't look like crying but he frequently scrunched up his nose. (I think he was Chansung, I saw his face being linked to the name Changsun on screen during 'break segments' where a short film would be played on screen while the members got a breather/changed clothes. But when I first saw him, I was sure he'd be the maknae).

 Kisu (pretty sure) held his microphone in front of his face like a moustache. When it was Hui's turn, he said something along the lines that he hadn't high expectations for Romania (LOL) but he was proved wrong and absolutely liked it here. Two things that stood out for him were a Romanian dish called Sarmale [cue cheering crowd  I personally hope he ate those with vita de via (green ones), since they are even so much more better than the usual ones] and a flashmob that happened that morning. Someone (I forgot who, perhaps Kisu?) also said 'I will now talk in Romanian' and said a whole sentence, I couldn't make out what though. Anyway, I'm super happy that he tried!

They performed their last song and went off stage. The crowd then started chanting '24K! 24K!' and after a few minutes they came back! They performed two more songs and it was absolutely crazy. Cory's expressions drove me insane.

Someone (dark brown hair but shorter than The Visual One), took a water bottle and dowsed the contents over his head. He started shaking it and droplets flew into the crowd. It was glorious. He did it for a second time and that time water droplets actually HIT MY FACE! I was in row six and I absolutely didn't expected it! I died for a second time. Non. Nichts. Nada. Finish. There was only a shell of my former self left. I don't think the encore were title songs, I recognized the second one as a popular b-side. After performing they went backstage and the concert was over for real.

Now to each member:

Cory's English was really good to understand, even as someone who has difficulties understanding spoken foreign languages. He was basically the MC of the concert and he did his job so well, it was absolutely amazing. I loved his angry expressions at songs like 'Still 24K' and his hip hop stage. His voice is very pleasant to listen to and I felt he always tried his best to hype the crowd. He often dipped his head back and let me tell you, he has a reallllly sexy neck and adams apple, I absolutely loved it. He also wore the most eye make up.

He had at the first talking segment a tissue which he would use to pat his forehead carefully with. In the second talking segment he didn't have a tissue and motioned one of the assistants behind the scenes to come on stage hastily and give him a tissue. 

Kisu has a really high voice and often stood on the right side and between two others. I remember him having big eyes and lots of black eye shadow. He did a few antics with the mic when he had it.

Changsun was smiling a lot. He also stood a lot at the far right of the stage. 

Hui is the person that voice I love in the 24K songs belonged to! He is the smallest and I didn't see him much in the center. But I think he was adorable. The blue of his hair really suited him.

The visual was the tallest member with the tannest skin and hands down, the most handsome face. Like ugh, his face was nearly perfect. He seems to be the official visual, too, since he has the first part in Still 24K (I looked it up and it turns out to be Jinhong? But the search results really don't show his handsomeness at all. Seriously, he more tanned, has godly proportions and a really REALLY handsome face from all possible angles. Part of the vocal line. In the beginning songs I thought that he'd become my favorite but then came Cory's hip thrusting and expression and everything and he was demoted. Still love him, though.

There was one member with a middle part and at the end of the concert his face seemed the most glistening with sweat. I think he also wore the Romanian flag as a robe (someone wore it and I think it was him). His haircut didn't really suit him.

Then there was the guy that I thought as 'possibly Cory' in the beginning. Right now I can't remember anything specific about him but I think he was probably involved in the hip hop or dancing stage (?).

The boys had real mics (the big ones) and were singing live with a backing track, I think.

The fans were okay-mannered. A lot of them had really fashionable, distinctive styles (hair, make up and clothes). I was right at the middle gangway and of course the fans from the worse seats gathered there instead of staying in their seats. When I entered the concert hall, someone actually had put their clothes on my seat but removed them once I entered. The girl in front of me had a light stick (they were gigantic and looked like they belong to a Star Wars cosplay) but she didn't wave it. At one point a girl that stood in the pathway sat down/leaned on my seat where I had my poster and jacket. I grabbed my things and she quickly stood up. Overall, they were very loud but most people kept their hands down, even during the more hard hitting songs. 

After the encore the concert hall cleared pretty quickly. I was excited to meet the group so I went to the staff in the front. When about 2/3 of the fans were out, I saw two  totally in red dressed paramedics coming from the exit doors, used the side entrace to the stage and went backstage. First I thought that a fan might have fainted because there was a group of fans talking animatedly to the backstage people but it turned out that they just wanted signed posters (I think there had been an issue). 

First no one really noticed me, then a man told me to go to a staff member at the side of the stage who was discussing with two fans, one of them sobbing. I went there and found out that meeting the group wasn't possible anymore! NO ONE told me that  not the woman on the telephone who called me twice to check my ticket purchase, it wasn't written on the site where I bought the tickets and it certainly wasn't written on my ticket either! 

We pleaded for a photo but the woman said no, they are all sweaty right now. Another man said they couldn't let us enter because we couldn't prove that we haven't been backstage yet (mind you, one girl was crying - and even if that's the case, THEY had the responsibility to check that every VIP only goes backstage only once, they could have a list with the seats that were backstage already or write something on the tickets, of course we can't prove we haven't been backstage).
She offered us that we could get letters written from them and I said yes euthusiastically (the other girls also agreed). 

Now comes a kind of serious and speculative part because I think one of the 24K members had perhaps some kind of serious health issue after the concert. The staff assistant asked us for our favorites, the first one said Jinhong. The second one named another member, I coudn't hear the name but the woman said that he's not available so the fan had to change her pick (she then named Jinhong, too). I picked Cory and in that moment I was really anxious about him being the unavailable one but it turns out that he was okay! She asked us for our names and we wrote them down on her mobile, then I and the sobbing girl gave them out posters for them to sign, too. She went backstage and we waited.

She came back with two posters for us and Din-A4 papers with our names and an autograph of our biases. I thanked her and went outside while other fans approached her about their issues (I think there were more VIPs that weren't aware they had to come before the concert). In front of the concert hall was another crying fans and several fans complaining in Romanian. It was a bummer that the concert ended that way.

On my way home (same street as the venue) I saw an ambulance coming from the direction of the concert venue though the lights were turned off. When I came home I checked the posters and every member signed them so I was curious why that one girl couldn't get a mention from her bias but he could still mysteriously sign two posters? I don't know if any of them really got sick or if they were just too tired to sign posters but something didn't add up. To be honest, I think they exchanged the posters with two pre-signed ones. I was concerned because everyone knows how overworked idols are and the thought of me enjoying their performance when they might have not is a bit disheartening. I hope the members get the rest they deserve once they go back to Korea.

tldr: Overall, great concert. I was surprised because it exceeded my expectations. Fell in love with Cory but there were misunderstandings with the VIP seats.

Edit 2: TITLE. NOT TILE. English is hard. 

This is your call for snacks, beverages, pillows, you name it. I'm not gonna include pictures though since they just signed their names and stuff. 

I got to the Lotte store in Pyeongchon after 6 pm and went towards the place were the fan sign was being held. I checked in and drew my number I was C 11 so I was one of the first people to go. Throughout the entire fan sign the boys were waving at us, giving us hearts, basically anything cute you could think of, they gave it to us. The girl to my left was a die hard Haechan stan and literally lost it every time he did something. The girl to my right was from China and a Winwin stan. I was the only Johnny stan that I knew of. There might have been others there. I was also the only American there. I'm slowly getting used to being the only or one of the few Americans at NCT events. The ages of the fans were a mix of ranges. Lots of noonas. 

This was the seating from left to right:

* Doyoung
* Taeil
* Winwin
* Yuta
* Jaehyun
* Mark
* Haechan
* Johnny
* Taeyong 

I waited for my turn to come and the Korean phrase that I practiced little left my brain. So I was a mess for Doyoung, Taeil, and Winwin but they were really sweet and all wished me ""Happy New Year"" and said ""Thank you"" to me in English. All angels really. 

I gave Doyoung a thumbs up and he smiled.  Doyoung truly is sunshine and rainbows. Taeil is so beautiful. I struggled but he understood and bless your soul. Winwin is such a cutie pie. Oh my god. He spelled my name wrong but he looked puzzled at my name. I'm sorry it is a name from Ireland honey. I'M SORRY. 

Next was Yuta. This was a pretty adorable moment for me. 

&gt;  **Yuta:** [looks at me wide eyed] Hello!!!!

 &gt; **Me:** Hello!!! Miguk saram. 

&gt; **Y:** Where?

&gt; **M:** Wisconsin [you have no idea where that is Yuta but thank you for asking]? Hagane no Renkinjutsushi? 

&gt; [Yuta looks at me confused]

&gt; **M:** Hagane no [does the motion Edward Elric does for alchemy] 

&gt; **Y:** Oh oh! Yes! Yes!  [does the motions Edward does as well]

&gt; **M:** Yes yes! 

&gt; **Y:** Like?

&gt; **M:** Love! Love! 

&gt; **Y:** Thank you!

&gt; **M:** Thank you! 

YUTA IS A FMA FAN. MY INNER 13 YEAR OLD IS CRYING. 

Next was Jaehyun and I literally just gave him his picture and stared because he is so pretty. His visuals. So perfect. 

Then came Mark Lee. 

&gt; **Me:** What's up Canada? 

&gt; **Mark:** Hi. [says name]

&gt; **Me:** Yup. I'm actually from America though. 

&gt; **Mark:** Cool. How long have you been following us? 

&gt; **Me:** Since the Rookies were announced in 2013. 

&gt; **Mark:** Oh wow. What's your favorite song? 

&gt; **Me:** [thinks] Seventh Sense.

&gt; **Mark: I like that too. 

&gt; **Me:** Yeah. I like the beat. 

&gt; **Mark:** Thank you. See you again. 

After Mark was Haechan and I once again just stared because he's my precious baby. But I said ""Thank you Haechanie."" Baby.

I then moved over and waited for Johnny to finish up with the girl ahead of me. She left and he looked at me like ""Oh hi. An American."" Here we go folks. The first of many encounters I will have with Johnny. 

&gt; **Johnny:** Hi.

&gt; **Me:** Hello. First of all, the Bears still suck. 

&gt; **J:** [signs his picture] Do they now?

&gt; **M:** I'm from Wisconsin. I have to say that. 

&gt; **J:** I have a lot of friends that go there.

&gt; **M:** Madison?

&gt; **J:** Mhmm.

&gt; **M:** I went to Carroll. Okay I have to ask because the internet needs to know: Cubs or White Sox? 

&gt; **J:** [looks at me as if there really is no other team in the world] Cubs. 

&gt; **M:** Yes good. Cause I know Chris Bosio, the Cubs pitching coach. 

&gt; **J:** [looks at me as if I am the coolest person in the world] Really?

&gt; **M:** Yeah. He taught my brother in high school. 

&gt; **J:** [looks at me dumbfounded] Wow.

&gt; **M:** Also, you're wearing the Phoenix Coyotes jersey and I'm [does various hand gestures]

&gt; **J:** [touches jersey] Yeah I wish I was wearing a Blackhawks jersey.

&gt; **M:** Yeah an 88 P Kane but the USA jersey of course. Gotta represent.

&gt; **J:** Yup. Thank you.

&gt; **M:** Also, you're my bias. 

&gt; **J:** [looks away embarrassed] Thank you.

&gt; **M:** [as I leave] You finally debuted. 

So to recap, Johhny is a Cubs fan and a hockey fan. I STAN PERFECTION. MY UB IS WONDERFUL. He wasn't even expecting this type of conversation I could tell. When I sent this convo to /u/omobolasire she literally started dying because he really wasn't expecting that at all. ""First of all, the Bears still suck"" is an iconic opening sentence. I  definitely made an impression that's for sure. The next time I see him he will remember that I was the girl who talked sports. 

Finally it was TY. 

&gt; **Taeyong:** [looks at me excited] Hello!!!!

&gt; **Me:** Hello!!!

&gt; [TY signs his picture]

&gt; **TY:** Thank you. See you again.

&gt; **M:** Oh trust me. You will.

Trust me, Leader. You will see me a lot. 

I then went back to my seat and my legs were shaking. That happened. THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Johnny looked at me a few times but I quickly looked away because help nope can't nope. CANNOT. After the last person went, the members started talking and then got up and came to the front of the stage and talked to us some more. After they talked, they gave us their greeting and then left. 

We all got out our phones finally and started talking to the general public what happened. The girl to my right looked at my phone and said ""Johnny fan."" I looked at her and said ""Yes. My Christmas wish on Christmas Eve. Johnny debut. Meet Johnny."" She looked at me. ""REALLY??"" Once they gave us the all clear we left. 

I survived my first of what will be many NCT 127 interactions. I just really love them a lot and I am so glad I bias them now. Like really glad. I just love them so much. Words really escape me. 

BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I SURVIVED MEETING JOHNNY. LET THAT SINK IN. I HAVE SURVIVED THIS FATEFUL ENCOUNTER.

And then there are artists like Zico, who frequently produces his own tracks (not sure to what extent though) - which seems to bring him more critical acclaim. 



Knowing who the producer is interesting and cool. I love all the Gfriend title tracks so much - even though they often sound the same, idc! I'd love to see a face and hear the voice behind the music.



The role would be like the ""leader"" title. One of the idols (his/her training may have been different than the others) would have the ""producer"" title. Their role would be to co-produce their title tracks, or something along those lines. 





I wonder though, would this member have any time to both be a performing idol while producing all the time? (probably not?)




But what if they didn't necessarily perform with the group. Like they are on the realities and are at all the shows and photo shoots, who would be introduced before debut to gain a following. 


And have the specified training to be not only a strong producer, but also to be camera friendly, attractive, and presentable like any other idol must be while in the public eye. Not so much singing and dancing like the other members.




Idk if this makes sense. But I wonder if that's something that could be worked into the industry successfully.


I kinda doubt it to be honest - I feel like fans would mercilessly beg him/her to perform, which would defeat the purpose. 



Then again, Tablo essentially has that role within Epik High. Tablo performs the music he himself wrote and often produced. Buf I don't really know if I consider them kpop anyway. Tablo performs the music himself and is incredibly charismatic.


BUT I wonder what other people think ~ is this a bogus hypothetical, or an idea with potential? 




TLDR: could a kpop group integrate a new member whose sole job is to produce songs. He would promote with the group but not perform, as he probably lacks time to prioritize the performance element of being an idol. But is an idol nonetheless.",23,0,False,self,,,,,

&gt; It's a shame that I had to find out 2NE1 will be releasing their final album through a news article. This is very unfortunate as I was previously a member of the group 2NE1, but I share the same feelings as the other members in wanting to show appreciation and bid farewell to everyone for all their love and support of 2NE1. I am truly grateful and sincerely appreciate all the love 2NE1 received and hope for your extended love and support as the members continue on in their individual careers. Thank you.

When I enter a thread for a new release, I'm usually looking for people's initial reactions matching mine, but I'm also looking for things about a song that people catch that I may not catch on to. So my questions to r/kpop are just as the title says: what makes a song ""good"" according to you? What is your criteria (if you have one)?

Also, I was reading (I think on either here or another site) about Korean hip hop and someone mentioned that non-Korean speakers don't have the background to critique hip hop tracks in Korean because they don't speak Korean; therefore, they don't know how Korean rap would flow. Yet they're able to say that other Korean tracks are good or bad and all the variables that go into someone having a good or bad singing voice matter  even though the song is in Korean. Do you agree with this or nah? Is this something you think of when it comes to your criteria?",28,22,False,self,,,,,

Photos: http://imgur.com/a/Ot9S7

I picked 3-4 members of groups that my sister and I follow.


Here are the groups and members I picked:


**NCT**

* Ten

* Mark

* Taeyong


**SNSD**

* Taeyeon

* Sunny

* Seohyun

* Sooyoung


**F(X)**

* Luna

* Amber

* Victoria


**EXO**

* Chanyeol

* D.O.

* Sehun

* Kai


**G-Friend**

* Yuju

* Eunha

* Yerin

* SinB


**BlackPink**

* Lisa

* Rose

* Jennie


**Red Velvet**

* Wendy

* Seulgi

* Joy


Unfortunately, I had no white cardstock, so I just printed em out in blue paper. I made each card in Photoshop, trying to follow a theme for each group (e.g. Exo Overdose, SNSD CMIYC, G-Friend Megustas Tu, etc.)


We also set up a list of question we're not allowed to ask like if a the group this member is in debuted before or after a certain year, or questions regarding gender and member-count of the groups. 


Looking to make a new set of cards for the other members, and even add more groups like Mamamoo, Shinee, Wonder Girls, SISTAR, etc.

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

**Edit**: Nothing to see here folks. They were on the broadcast but weren't on r/kpop [Music Bank info]( https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/music-shows/music-bank/20170120) so I just assumed.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure if this is business as usual but [during the Pentagon's interview you can see Varsity \(I think?\) in the background](https://youtu.be/fp3Dj9hYuZE?t=11m7s) making their way inside.  13 mintues later, [Varsity is seen exiting the building](https://youtu.be/fp3Dj9hYuZE?t=24m40s).  I thought they just needed the interview for being such a new group but afterwards they just went back to their cars!?  



Same thing happened to BP Rania.  They enter the building at [5:35](https://youtu.be/fp3Dj9hYuZE?t=5m35s) and exit at [31:45](https://youtu.be/fp3Dj9hYuZE?t=31m45s).  They get interviewed and then headed back down the road they just came from.



So Varsity and BP Rania weren't on the MuBank broadcast.  One of the MCs mentions that groups are [told to come to the studio at 7:30 every Friday](https://youtu.be/fp3Dj9hYuZE?t=34m6s).  So I guess this means some groups just show up and hope to be added to the show?  Maybe they got cut right then and there.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised but seeing it happen on video and in such bad weather only enhanced my reaction.  



If anyone has examples of this happening to other groups in the past, please share.  I could be all wrong and massively misinterpreting this.

1778,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2017-1-21,2017,1,21,23,5pas0e,self.kpop,[Fan Account] Kim Jaejoong's comeback concert - Rebirth of J,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5pas0e/fan_account_kim_jaejoongs_comeback_concert/,Rubyrues,1485007885,"Let me begin with the unfortunate fact that I have no pictures or videos of the actual concert. They were absolutely vicious in catching people tonight and kicking them out. To the actual fan account:

The concert took place at   (Korea University). It was kind of smaller venue, but there was still at least a good 5k-7k people, I think. Getting to the venue was a near nightmare. The weather today in Seoul was bitterly cold and snowy, causing traffic delays, icy roads, and forcing my second bus (all of us going to the concert), to hike an additional 20 minutes up a very snowy and slippery hill to get to the venue. Totally worth it in the end. 

The concert began around 6:35/18:35 and started with a short VCR of Jae thanking us for waiting for him and how happy he is to see us all again. He sang the opening song ""Love You To Death"" before pausing to introduce himself and talk. Favorite part of the talk was him commenting that the weather is always kind of shitty for his concerts. The last concert he held there was -8C. Today was also -8C. ""Yes, hello, I'm -8C Kim Jaejoong from now on"". 

He sang a total of about 15 songs, including Run Away, Good Morning Night, One Kiss, Breathing, Love You More, Luvholic, and Mine. I can't remember all of them because the whole thing is in a haze of post-concert giddiness. Good Morning Night was probably my favorite song he performed tonight. We sang the chorus three times after the song ended because we were all so into it. The encore songs were Just Another Girl and a sweet and sad song that we all sang together (I am absolutely failing on song titles tonight). 

Words cannot describe just how utterly amazing he is in live performance. He hit every single note with precision and the ranges he hit with ease were seriously awe inspiring. His stage presence is unreal and the charisma just oozed from him. He's also downright gorgeous. Years of pictures and videos have absolutely nothing on what he looks like in person. I was 5 feet away from him when he would come down the stage, so seeing him so close gave me shivers. Also. Dat chest. 

Another fun moment from the night were his talks with us on stage, which were very personal and felt like we were old friends catching up. Korean concerts are very much like this, I think, because there's such a deep relationship built between the artist and the fans. Especially so for Jaejoong, since a large portion of these fans, myself included, have been following him for 10+ years. (He also called us perverts towards the end because he was just wearing a jacket and his chest was visible and he was obviously hot and we told him to take it off. The lot of us were therefore pervs. He then said he was very cold and closed the jacket).

Along with the stage talks he did a segment where he went behind stage to get dressed but still kept talking to us (including an oddly appealing dance while half naked and the camera was focused on his lower stomach and crotch. He promptly got embarrassed and apologized) and was inspecting the audience. He started doing this a while ago and it makes for some funny situations. The first person the cameras focused on was a girl dressed up in a wedding dress who had made signs telling Jaejoong he's not allowed to get married. The entire audience was very much on board and he was offended (""oh, so YOU guys can get married but I can't?! How is that fair??"") but finally gave in. There were fans from China, Hong Kong, Japan, America, etc. 

The ending of the concert was adorable and bittersweet because we were all sad it was over so quickly. He also fought with us because we kept asking for more and he kept trying to say the young kids need to go to sleep (and him). This led to a polling of the audience on ages, and while the vast majority of us were in our 20's and 30's, there was a remarkable amount of fans from 40-60, with the oldest at the young age of 73! 

Okay. I've rambled enough. I think I covered the majority of it. I'm sorry I couldn't grab any videos or pictures, but believe me. If you ever have the opportunity, see him live. You won't regret it (even the boyfriends/husbands who were forced to go tonight were rocking out).

NCT 127's Limitless packaging is the exact size and very similar design to the December 2016 edition of Don't Panic Seoul.

I then realized that if I was to give Johnny a Cubs hat I was gonna need a bag. Good thing there was a Daiso nearby. I walked past the Live Plaza around 6 pm and already a huge crowd was forming. The joys of public fansigns. 

I bought my bag and found a spot on the first floor near the convention center and wrote a quick little message to include with the hat, collected my wits, practiced what I wanted to say in Korean, and then made my way back to Live Plaza. Since they has individual boxes again, I have no idea when Johnny will get the hat but I do hope he enjoys it. 

During the entire fansign, it was loud. The crowd was ridiculous. We're going to be hitting EXO levels within the next year or two. So many of the fansites were there as were regular fans who just wanted to see them. There was little a section of Johnny fans. I cried a little. MY PEOPLE. The boys also delivered on their promise of giving us chocolate at the fansign. I love this angels. Throughout the fan sign, the boys were throwing hearts left and right and it was ridiculously cute. 

Here was the seating order for the fansign: 

* Haechan
* Taeil
* Winwin
* Mark
* Yuta
* Doyoung
* Jaehyun
* Johnny
* Taeyong 

95 BF sitting together again my heart. 

Throughout the entire fansign, staff was rushing us so it was pretty impossible to have conversations. Luckily, I only had one sentence I wanted to say to all of the members. The phrase I was saying was this:      which pretty much means ""I'll always cheer for you."" Translations of the Korean will be in [] for Haechan since most of the conversations were the same. Doyoung is a little different. 

First up Haechan:

&gt; **Haechan:** . [Hello]

&gt; **Me:** .     . [Hello.] [Phrase that was just mentioned] 

&gt; **HC:** . [Thank you]

&gt; **Me:**  Haechanie. [Thank you]

&gt; Haechan smiles. 

He's so cute and adorable. I gave him a thumbs up as well. 

Next was Taeil. It was super loud when I got to him.  

&gt; **Taeil:** . 

&gt; **Me:**  .     .

&gt; [Taeil looks confused as he listens while signing my name and once again messing it up but it's okay baby]

&gt; **Me:** Loud.     .

&gt; **Taeil:** Oh. .

&gt; **Me:**  Moon Taeil. 

&gt; [Taeil smiles] 

A group of angels honestly.

Then was Winwin, and man is this child a dork. 

&gt; **Winwin:** .

&gt; **Me:** . 

&gt; **Winwin:** Hello. My name is Winwin.

&gt; **Me:**     .

&gt; **Winwin:** Oh. . Happy New Year. 

&gt; **Me:** You too. 

Hello. My name is Winwin. YOU ARE SO PRECIOUS. WE MUST PROTECT YOU. 

Then, we have Canada's very own Mark Lee.

&gt;**Mark:** Hello.

&gt; **Me:** Hello again.

&gt; **M:** [says my name]

&gt; **Me:** Yup. 

&gt; **M:** [Toronto] Maple Leafs, huh? [Note: I was wearing my Leafs sweater]

&gt; **Me:** Yup. Original Six. [Mark chuckles] I mean, you are wearing the Rangers jersey today. 

&gt; **M:** Turned out that way.

&gt; **Me:** I mean we [NHL] are 100 years old now.

&gt; **M:** Yeah. Thank you. See you again.

&gt; **Me:** Thank you. You will. 

I love you Canada. There was actually a fan holding a sign with the Canadian flag on it. 

After Mark was Yuta.

&gt; **Yuta:** [sees me and remembers me] Oh! Hello! 

&gt; **Me:** Hello! [Yuta signs]     .

&gt; **Yuta:** [looks at me with great respect] Thank you. Bye! See you!

&gt; **Me:** Bye! 

To take away from this very short conversation, Yuta remember me from Sunday.

Then came Doyoung and this was just precious beyond words. 

&gt; **Doyoung:** . 

&gt; **Me:** .     .

&gt; **DY:** [looks at me shyly] . [signs my picture but keeps smiling at me shyly] . . [meanwhile I am dying of the cute because this baby angel!!!] Bye. [DY is telling me ""thank you"" in the informal way]

&gt;**M:** Thank you! 

We kept stealing glances at each other too. This cutie pie. I LOVE YOU KIM DOYOUNG. 

Then it was my turn with Jaehyun. On Sunday I couldn't even talk to him because visuals so today I was gonna talk to him. 

&gt; **Jaehyun:** Hello.

&gt; **Me:** Hello. You're really beautiful.

&gt; **JH:** Thank you. [signs]

&gt; **M:** Thank you. 

I turn into putty around that kid. HE ISN'T EVEN MY BIAS. 

And now folks, the moment you have all waited for. The Second Meeting Between u/jolaurence and Johnny Suh. 


&gt; **Johnny:** [looks at me and remembers me right away] Oh! Hello!

&gt; **Me:** Hello again!

&gt; **J:** [says my name]

&gt; **M:** Yeah. It's actually pronounced [corrects pronunciation]. But ""Hey, you"" works too.

&gt; [Johnny laughs]

&gt; **M:** Okay. What's your favorite DCOM?

&gt; **J:** DCOM? [he says this as he signs my picture] 

&gt; **M:** Disney Channel Original Movie.

&gt; **J:** Oh. Um. Uh. What was it? [is clearly trying to remember the movie as he hands back my pictures then remembers and says excitedly] Brink!

&gt; **M:** Yes. Brink! The best one! Thank you! 

&gt; **J:** Thank you! See you again.

&gt; **M:** Thank you. You will. 

First of all, JOHNNY REMEMBERED ME. Secondly, we have the same favorite DCOM. Third, I made him laugh. I MADE JOHNNY LAUGH. You could tell that he was clearly trying to answer my question. His face was so focused and he was like flustered too. This was also another conversation he was not expecting at a fan sign. Keeping him on his toes. One day I will break out the Korean when I see him. And eventually I will tell him he's my UB. ~~Also his smile is the most beautiful thing in the world.~~

Finally was Taeyong. 

&gt; **Taeyong:** [clearly remembers me] Oh! Hello again!

&gt; **Me:** Hello again! [TY signs]     .

&gt; **TY:** Oh! Thank you! See you again?

&gt; **M:** You will! 

TY REMEMBERED ME, ALL! Yes, TY. You will see me again. I have no idea when, well, I have a day I want to see you but it is all by luck again. 

I got my chocolate, sat down, and breathed again. After they finished signing, they said a few words, and then told us that they were gonna take a picture with us. Well, I'll take that as picture proof of me meeting Johnny. 

Overall, it was fantastic seeing them again. I really do love these boys and joining this fandom has been great. I'm still one of the few Americans in it, but eventually there will be more of us and since I plan on being here for a while, I will be ready to help them dive in. If you asked me a month ago if I would be doing this, I would have laughed. But here I am knee deep and so IN LOVE.

Events that have happened: 

Kursun, an individual from Turkey participated on the country's version of The Voice. At his audition, he claims to have composed the song and written the lyrics to the track he sings, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sorFhKkib5o) the video to his audition. 

[Official MV to VIXX's Dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bnIb1JJHdA)


Since then, after Starlights have gone to Twitter telling him that he has plagiarized and asked for an apology he and his team made a statement on Facebook stating: 

&gt; [Fans, should apologize for their behavior online... that it was sad Turkish fans were not fans of people of their own country but of a foreign country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5pfl76/turkish_the_voice_contestant_who_plagiarized/utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=new&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=kpop)

Kursun himself took to his Twitter to make fun of VIXX writing: 

&gt;[The weather is cold, if you catch a cold, you should rub your feet with Vicks to get better.](https://twitter.com/kursunofficial/status/822865525147627525)

And also replied to Starlights, and other K-Pop enthusiasts that their [activity to his Twitter would help him get verified.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPigGx2lMBY/?taken-by=the_only_starlight)

Explanation of situation:


First 50 seconds is Han Suji, this 50 seconds is what has been featured throughout the drama, Heize's recording has never appeared in the drama. Due to the popularity, CJ E&amp;M had recorded a full version and released it as the final instalment to the Goblin OST.

After fans discovered that there were two recordings mixed, they have now demanded for the original version by Han Suji to be released. CJ E&amp;M have considered releasing the version which is just solely Han Suji even though it is 50 seconds long. 


-----


Heize's Instagram post: https://www.instagram.com/p/BPppok_A-_h/

Soft translation of Heize's caption:

Hello, this is Heize.

I understand that there have been different stories being passed around about the OST that I recently participated in for the drama Goblin. I wanted to wait for feedback regarding the circumstances of what has happened before addressing the issue. I did not try to sabotage the situation/ steal the part. I was offered to sing Round and Round for the drama, and the 50 second intro of the song that everyone is familiar with that is sung by Han Suji and had already existed and I had completed the rest of the song. I am not sure why the track was mixed with both versions when they had planned to release the track. I have no statement to give regarding this. I am not part of the planning team for the drama or OST, and like fans of the show, I am just as frustrated about this.
When I went to record my version of the song, I had recorded the entire song from start to finish, however the released version was a mixed between both the original and my version. It was also the fact that I had been labeled as the main artist and when I had participated in the recording and I was not informed that another artist would be part of the track from what I have read in articles that have stated that this was planned in advance.
However, to those making assumptions regarding the situation and spreading false informations as if it they were real, this is my story.
I am still waiting for feedback, and I am sorry that the use of my name in the song has been causing confusions. However, I would like to remind you again, what I have stated above are the real facts, and I wanted to clarify the situation from my position.
I am sorry to my fans those that have been confused. 

Thank you for reading this story/explanation.

**Update**

Follow up, CJ E&amp;M has released an official apology to fans, Han Suji and Heize regarding the controversy as well as an explanation:

&gt;The issue first arose when viewers realized there were two singers for final OST and opening track Round and round. Viewers liked the Goblin OST so much that when the track was released, they expected to hear the voice of Han Soo Ji, who sang the opening. However, they discovered that singer-rapper Heize sang most of the song, while Han Soo Ji was only a feature artist.

&gt;An argument soon arose between fans and viewers that only grew after Han Soo Ji posted a curious message on her Facebook, saying, [As a singer] I dont have a face. As Goblin is popular, everyone and their related companies are probably sprinting to ride on the wave [of popularity], but I am just the way I am everyday.

&gt;In response to the controversy, Heize also posted a message on her personal Instagram, saying, Ive never done anything shady and I dont plan on doing so in the future. We are currently in a situation where were waiting to get feedback on the featuring notation. I havent stolen anything from anyone.

&gt;Meanwhile, CJ E&amp;M released an official apology and explanation in regards to the controversy, saying, First of all, the full version of this song was written by music director Nam Hye Seung before the broadcast began. It was then chosen for the dramas title video. In order to have an opening with impact, Han Soo Ji was chosen to record the first 50 seconds of the song. But ever since he wrote Round and round, music director Nam Hye Seung had another voice in mind for the rest of the song.

&gt;Because there were requests to release Round and round, Heize participated in singing the rest of the song. This was the songs original conception at the time it was written. The opening contains two measures that are different because the song needed to fit the length of the broadcast title video. But other than that, Han Soo Jis part was included without any modifications. Her 50-second part was not released separately because the full 50 seconds were featured in the opening.

&gt;However, we will take into account the opinions of the viewers and consider releasing the 50-second version of Han Soo Jis part. We would like to deeply apologize to both Han Soo Ji and Heize, who were confused during the process. We are also sorry for not satisfying the viewers. Thank you.

Fans are currently protesting on DR Music's Twitter (also with the hashtag #LetAlexDance), Facebook, e-mail, and even [Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/dr-music-entertainment-let-bp-rania-s-alexandra-stand-on-the-full-stage-of-make-me-ah-and-every-other-bp-rania-performance).

Alex has been with (BP) Rania since 2015 and has not once danced an entire stage.

When fans were angry with DR Music for not letting her dance the full choreography in Start a Fire, Alex tweeted ""[Whatever you have to say in life, always let your voice be heard.  It may fall on deaf ears but at least you did your part.](https://twitter.com/thealexreid/status/817015453566386176)"" Alex also posted a video of her and Ttabo dancing to [Dr. Feel Good](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPsS02pgF0c/) on Instagram. Alex wants to dance, but it seems that DR Music is not allowing her to do so.

This information has been confirmed on fan pages [BP RANIA Daily](https://twitter.com/BPRANIAdaily/status/824360372022943744), [7-RaNiAgirls](http://7raniagirls.tumblr.com/post/156369541400/urgent-notice-alex-is-not-considered-to-be), and [A1st Sherlock](https://twitter.com/A1STSherlock/status/824362767738163200), all of which claim to have received this information from one of Alex's representatives.",84,122,False,self,,,,,

Rough translation of the hashtags:

There's also a Naver article about it [here](http://entertain.naver.com/music/now/read?oid=108&amp;aid=0002586568) (if you want me to, I can try figuring out a translation of it and post it in the comments later).

Right now I dont have words to express my feelings, but I hope that everyone will remember us fondly even in 10 or 20 years. To Wonderful, whom Ive always been proud of, Im sorry and thank you so much.

I don't know if this is allowed, but I just want to say: thank you. Thank you for a wonderful ten years, Lee Sunmi. Thank you for sticking out with Wonder Girls until the end.

It is gonna be a little different than most of my fan accounts. 

The fan meeting [which of course happened on 1/27 because SM just keeps being interconnected with things] was announced last week and when I saw the date I got super happy because I did not have work. It's Seollal. That means I don't have work. In order to enter for a chance for this one, you had to buy cds at certain Hottracks locations or online. In total, 700 of us would be meeting them. 

So what did I do? I WENT TO ILSAN TO BUY CDS ON SUNDAY. ILSAN. That's outside of Seoul by a ways. I got my cds on Sunday and then literally hoped and prayed and wished to get in. The list was supposed to be up after 5 pm on Wednesday but they posted it early. I started crying at work when I read my name. It was a very bad week at work so getting into this was wonderful.

I left my apartment later than I wanted to and forgot that the trains are running on a holiday schedule. I got to the Coex Artium which is where SMTOWN is and went to the elevator because today new EXO goods were released and there was a line out the door and around the area. I went to 5F and got in the correct line without even realizing it. Check in started at noon and there were already a lot of us there.

I checked in, got my wristband, and pulled my ticket from the box. I was on the first floor in row P seat 27. I was so happy I was on the first floor because I did not want to be up on the second floor. I then left to get food. It was during that time when my NCT twitter friends literally started tweeting at me ""THEY ARE WEARING SUITS. YOU ARE GONNA DIE."" 

THEY WERE RIGHT.

So here I was trying to eat when I kept picturing Johnny in a suit. Oh god no. This was gonna end bad. But it's okay. I collected myself, made sure I looked presentable, and headed back to SMTOWN. I went to 5F again and saw there was a little line for the fan light. SO I FINALLY GOT ONE. TOOK ME A FEW WEEKS BUT IT IS MINE. ALL MINE!!!!!!!!!!!! Our color is a neon-lime-ish green I guess? It looks really pretty though. I went through our little security and sat down. So this was happening then.

They were playing the first mini album as we waited. The fan meeting started a little after 2 pm. The screen lifted and the 7 of them (TY, Jaehyun, Winwin, Yuta, Mark, Haechan, Taeil) performed Firetruck. IN THE SUITS. I am gonna admit that I don't know the fan chant for this one as much since I wasn't over here when it came out but I did what I knew. My first thought was this: So. This is how it felt during the Rookies Showcases, huh?

After Firetruck ended, they left and Johnny and Doyoung came out with Shindong. He didn't do that bad of a job. Pray for my soul if Heechul is ever MC for an event in which NCT is promoting because my soul will not be ready. Anyway, the three of them started talking before the 7 returned. They did their greeting and staff brought out chairs. This was the seating order: Shindong, Johnny, Haechan, Mark, Winwin, Taeyong, Jaehyun, Yuta, Taeil, and Doyoung. They introduced themselves one by one and then Shindong asked about each song. Also, TY is so short. He is so small. They told him to make his chair higher but he complained about not reaching the floor then. THIS CHILD. 

After they talked about each song, they started the Q&amp;A section.  Fans submitted questions through Vyrl and members picked them out of the box. This is when I also mention that I had no idea what was going on for most of it. The language barrier thing, you know? But I am slowly working on it. (Am I learning Korean just for NCT? Maybe....) What I did understand was that they talked about who is the most fashionable member and favorite song. There were other questions answered but I really don't have idea. I kinda ended up just staring at Johnny. TY sang and rapped his favorite song from Drunken Tiger. Johnny's favorite song is ""Yesterday"" by The Beatles and then sang it. I DIED. I LOVE THE BEATLES AND HIS VOICE. IT'S SO DEEP. JOHNNY IS A BARITONE I KNOW IT. 

Sorry. Getting back on track. Doyoung sang his favorite ballad (of course it is a ballad. OF COURSE.) and Haechan sang Justin Bieber's ""Boyfriend"" and Johnny helped with part of it. Johnny in general was being big brother to Haechan and my heart was literally dying from the cute. 

Then, they sang another song for us: Good Thing. AND IT WAS SO GOOD. It was my first time seeing them perform Good Thing as well. Those suits really made the song feel extra sexy. Also, Jaehyun. Jaehyun stans, please collect your man. I mean it. But then, THEN. Johnny had a line. And he sounded so good. And I died. Again 

The screen then went down and they played  a behind the scenes of the music video filming and a few other behind the scenes videos before the screen went up and we saw tables. It was time for the stamp event. The boys all walked in and sat in the same order as when they were with Shindong. They had the people on the second floor go first and the very first person you met: Johnny. 

This is what went through my head: Okay. Johnny is first. What are you gonna say? There isn't much time though. But he looks good today. So do that. Yes.

I was on the right side of the first floor and towards the back so I was gonna be towards the end. When it was finally my side's turn to go, my brain literally started freaking out. This was my third time meeting them in two weeks. Oh boy. Would they even remember me?

I got on stage, sighed, and then it began. We are doing Johnny last.

After Johnny was Haechan, so I gave him my poster card and said ""Thank you"" as he stamped it. He wished me 'Happy New Year."" Then I went to Mark. 

&gt; **Me:** Hi again.

&gt; **Mark:** [kinda remembers me] Oh hi. Happy New Year.

&gt; **Me:** Thank you. You too.

Then I went to Winwin and it was kinda the same exchange. He sorta recognized me and wished me a ""Happy New Year."" 

TY was next and this child. He was stamping like a happy child. He looked up at me and smiled and I knew he remembered me. 

&gt; **TY:** Oh hi. Happy New Year! [stamps] Thank you! 

&gt; **Me:** Thank you! 

Look. He is a precious child that needs to be protected. I love him so much. 

Next was Jaehyun and I just gave it to him and said ""Thank you."" I am always gonna be awkward around him. I just know it and it's okay. 

After Jaehyun was Yuta. I put my poster card down and Yuta looked up at me.

&gt; **Yuta:** Ah! [eyes wide] Hi! Thank you! Happy New Year! [stamps]

&gt; **Me:**  Ah. Thank you!

&gt; **Yuta:** Fighting! 

&gt; **Me:** Yes. 

Yup. Yuta remembers me and did ""Fighting."" I am becoming known. 

Taeil was super easy because we just thanked each other. But Doyoung. Oh Doyoung.

&gt; **Doyoung:** [stamps] Thank you. [I turn to leave but he looks up] Oh. [eyes wide] Hello. [clearly remembers me and looks me directly in the eye AND SMILES] See you again. [this was not said as a question but a straight sentence]

&gt; **Me:** Ne. 

Doyoung clearly remembers me from Saturday. My brain literally short circuited. HE IS SO ADORABLE I CANNOT. OH MY GOD. DOYOUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm still recovering from this. ~~I love this little muffin so much you have no idea. He's second after Johnny for me.~~

Now, let's go back to Johnny. I have been used to having him second to last but him being first was new for me. So inside, I am shaking. Outside, I was calm and collected. Did I wear his favorite color today? Maybe. Did I make sure my hair looked really good? Yes. Was I gonna try to flirt? Well, let's see. 

&gt; **Me:** Hello again.

&gt; **Johnny:** [smiles] Hello.

&gt; **Me:** [looks him up and down as I hand him my poster card] You dress up nice.

&gt; **Johnny:** [flustered] Thank you. 

&gt; **Me:** For a Chicago boy. 

&gt; **Johnny:** [still flustered] Thank you. [hands me back my poster card and looks at me directly in the eye] Happy Lunar New Year. [he says this with his lisp]

&gt; **Me:** You too. 

So that happened. I'm from Wisconsin. Our two states hate each other. Yeah I did that. Me in the past from a few years ago would not have done that but who I am now is more confident in a way. 

Anyway, after I ended with Doyoung I went back to my seat and started breathing again and quickly took out my phone to let my friends know that they remembered me. As they were finishing up, Johnny started giving all of us hearts. He was in such a good mood. When they finished, we all thought it was done. They got up and went to the front as staff started removing the tables. Doyoung actually started helping them before they told him not to. THIS ANGEL. ANGEL I TELL YOU. Then the boys waved to us and said ""See you soon"" before the screen went down. Most of us had our phones out so we put them away as they played the teasers for the Limitless video. Then, the screen rose and we literally lost it. 

It was literally the best performance of Limitless I have seen so far. Was it because it was a room of 700 of us screaming the fan chant and the boys were wearing suits and in such a good mood? Maybe. It was just beautiful and perfect. When we get that first solo NCT concert with all of the units, I am gonna be a wreck. I have a feeling that this really is their year. They are gonna blow up by the end of the year. 

Edit: They posted video on the Instagram. [Cry with me](https://instagram.com/p/BPxSxLXApiW/). 

After Limitless, staff brought out mics for them to speak into and we got out our tickets because there was gonna be a little give away. Each member took turns pulling a ticket stub from the box. Johnny said his in English and he was so shy about it. Ulting him is both the best and worst decision of my life and I don't regret it one bit.

After the give away, each member said a few words of what they would be doing over the holiday/thanking us/the like. They then took a few pictures with us and then said their good byes. Doyoung was jokingly taking off his jacket while Johnny kept giving us hearts even as the screen was going down. The moment it went down, we all booked it. I turned my wifi back on to let my friends know that I have survived while I waited for my turn to go down the escalator. I got out in time to see them leave. And that was that.

I am so deep into this fandom now and I don't regret any second of it. These boys are wonderful and I can't wait for Dream's comeback as well as U's but 127 really has a place in my heart for good. They literally are wonderful angels and I fall more in love with them each time I see them. My first fan meeting with them: over. There will be more and I will be to as many as possible.

This week is a Seollal (Lunar New Year) Special, Ep 37 will continue its second round in Ep. 40.

**This week will work a bit differently, where the contestants get to choose from a pool of singers in the industry, rather than non-celebrities. In addition, primary contestants had to sing one of their own hits arranged as a duet.**


What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

In order of performance:

If you enjoy the daily music show posts on r/kpop, take a minute to read through this guide and join in the fun.  Last November, the mods of r/kpop changed the format for daily music shows by moving them to reddit's built-in wiki system.  They did this because the old way was too much work for one person to do every single day, and that person would get hateful comments if they missed a day.  With the new wiki system, the music shows are now community projects and aren't reliant on mods or one person.  Anyone who's reddit account is at least one year old and has earned at least 200 karma in r/kpop can create and edit the wiki pages.  So now everyone can be a contributor.  If a music show post isn't up, you can make it.  If a performance link is missing, you can add it.  If you find a broken link on an old performance, you can fix it.  This system only works if people contribute, and the more people who contribute, the better the system is.

####**How-To**

If this seems complicated and scary, it's really not.  Let's walk through how to create and edit a music show wiki post step-by-step.

* **Step 1** - Open last week's post for today's show.  You can click on the show logos in the sidebar to quickly search for the previous post, or go to the [main music shows wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/music-shows) and find it there.  The [information box](http://i.imgur.com/1OqJGq1.jpg) at the top of each post contains a link to the show's official YouTube and Naver channels.  Go ahead and open those in new tabs.  We'll need them later.

* **Step 2** - Click the [edit button](http://i.imgur.com/v8upaHv.jpg) at the top of the page.  Highlight the entire contents of the post and copy it to your clipboard.  Then click your back button to return to the post page.  I like to use last week's post for this because a lot of the same artists perform from week-to-week so it's makes our job easier.

* **Step 3** - Change the date in the [URL address bar](http://i.imgur.com/kh1ZzKA.jpg) of your browser to today's date and press enter.  You will arrive at a [blank page that says it does not exist in this subreddit and contains a link to create the page.](http://i.imgur.com/psjOAD8.jpg)  Click the link to create the wiki page.

* **Step 4** - You will now see a [blank text box on your new wiki page.](http://i.imgur.com/QbvK5p1.jpg)  Paste in last week's content that we copied to the clipboard earlier.  A preview will appear below the text box that should look exactly like last week's post.  Go ahead and change [the date at the top to today's date.](http://i.imgur.com/QndeURb.jpg)

* **Step 5** - Switch to the show's YouTube channel that we opened in a new tab earlier, and go to their videos page.  You should see today's performances there.  Right-click on the first one and copy the link.  Return to the wiki edit page and see if that artist is already there.  If they are, just paste the new link in place of the old one and go to the next video.  If the artist isn't listed, you'll have to add them in.  [Reddit's table system](http://i.imgur.com/Rnjkv.png) is fairly simple.  Each column in the table is separated by a |.  Each show is a little different, but it's usually ""Artist | Song | YouTube | Unofficial | Naver"".  Some shows might also have official fancams or other content in a column.  If this is confusing, you can always just copy/paste an existing line and edit the names and links.  Repeat this process for each video that is uploaded on YouTube, then switch over to Naver and do those, too.

* **Step 6** (optional) - Some of the shows only upload a portion of the performances to their official channels, or don't have an official YouTube at all (SBS MTV The Show).  In this case, you can search YouTube or other video sites for fan uploaded performances.  Tip:  Search for the show name in Hangul and limit your search to only videos uploaded ""today"".  The quality might be worse and they might get taken down at any time, but it's better than nothing.  This is where we really need a lot of people contributing to help find and update links that are out there.

* **Step 7** - Once you've added in all the video links from YouTube and Naver, go back and delete any artists that didn't perform this week and move around any that should be in a different category.  ""Debut Stage"" means the first time that artist has ever performed on that show.  ""Comeback Stage"" is the first performance of that song on that show.  ""Hot Stage"" or ""Regular Stage"" is for all other performances.  If you don't know which category a performance should go in, don't worry about it.  Just put it in the regular stages category.  If it's wrong, another fan can move it later.

* **Step 8** - Add a little note in the [reason for revision box](http://i.imgur.com/Y95FJpB.jpg) at the bottom of the page with what changes you made and click the ""Save Page"" button.

* **Step 9** - Now we're all done and just need to post our new wiki page to the subreddit.  Open r/kpop and click on the [Submit a New Link button](http://i.imgur.com/2ULSSa1.jpg) in the sidebar.  Paste in the [title from the wiki page](http://i.imgur.com/Ome5fPy.jpg) as your post title and paste in the [url](http://i.imgur.com/kh1ZzKA.jpg) as your link.  Only use the exact title of the wiki page as your title.  Do not editorialize or add extra info to the title like ""XXX Debut!"" or ""XXX Comeback!"".  Just the show and date.  Congrats, you did it!

#### **Notes**

* Do not deface or troll the wiki by doing things like changing a link to Rick Astley or putting fan comments on performances.  All changes to the wiki are tracked.  Mods will know exactly who made what changes.  If you deface it, your account will be banned from r/kpop for two weeks for the first offense and permanently for a second offense.

* In order to create or edit wiki pages your reddit account must be at least one year old and you must have earned at least 200 karma in r/kpop.  The karma number is the combined total of your link and comment karma, so you don't need to worry about submitting things to get there.  Just chat it up a bit in the comments and you'll have enough in no time.

* Each show is a little different and has different features, so be mindful of those.  Music Core has the ""5-minute Delay"" on V-app.  Countdown has official fancams on their M2 channel.  The Show doesn't have an official YouTube channel.  Music Bank's Naver channel is geolocked so you might need a proxy.

* Remember, these posts can only continue to exist if people like you hop in there and contribute.  If one of your fav's performance isn't listed, find a link and add it in.  If you click on a link and it's been removed, find a new one and add it in.  If you like the daily music show posts, it's up to all of us to make them great and keep them going.  Please add any suggestions or feedback for this guide in the comments.",10,139,False,self,,,,,

EDIT: I was not trying to swoop in and steal content from another user. There was no malicious intent behind this post. I was trying something new like I did with wiki and the [music show post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5o2lrd/sbs_%EC%9D%B8%EA%B8%B0%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94_inkigayo_january_15_2017/). Since this is a FORUM website, I thought it was a community thing. We can discuss the format of the post in the next town hall meeting but I am taking in all the feedback and am trying to make it better. That being said, it's not a bad idea to have a backup in place for /u/tastetherainbeau should they not be able to do it for whatever reason.",125,279,False,self,,,,,

""[@GOTYJ_Ars_Vita Bro we gotta make a Youngjae version of OBVI asap! https://sanjoy.lnk.to/Obvi  @elliottyamin and I are ready!](https://twitter.com/sanjoyd/status/825801830873468928)"" 

If you don't know, OBVI [(which you can listen to here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TznQx5RkBR4) is a song Sanjoy did with Elliott that he released this month; Elliott was a contestant on American Idol and came in third place one season, and one of his most popular releases back in the 2000's was his single [Wait For You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTVISrIww8). Elliott's response:  ""[Hell yeah!!..let's do it!!](https://twitter.com/elliottyamin/status/825802072280870912)""

They actually went to [GOT7's](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3Y9M1VUMAU0RCW.jpg) [fanmeeting](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3Y9M1RUMAAFmwY.jpg) today in LA, and Sanjoy posted this [video on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BP4HPiWh0PL/?taken-by=sanjoyd) a couple hours ago of Youngjae and them singing OBVI together. And, most recently, ""[OBVI is going to Korea Baby!!! Thank you so much for the support, I love you guys!...Special thanks to @333cyj333](https://www.instagram.com/p/BP4VIlyhwYy/?taken-by=sanjoyd)"". Youngjae also posted these two pics on Instagram with the following captions:

1. [  love you..](https://www.instagram.com/p/BP4HxOIj99v/?taken-by=333cyj333) (Rough translation: ""This picture didn't come out good but I still love you.."")
2. [love your voice @singlikeyaminit with @sanjoyd thank you bro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BP4IASVjI6q/?taken-by=333cyj333)

***

Not sure if this means Youngjae will sing his own version of OBVI, he'll sing with Elliott on the track, or if Sanjoy's going to make something entirely new for Youngjae to sing. To use a kind of similar example, some of Sanjoy's work reminds me of the collabs Far East Movement did with Chanyeol and Tinashe, Tiffany, Hyolyn, and Jay Park. Either way, I thought this was really cool and just thought I'd share, since this all basically happened today.  ",11,50,False,self,,,,,

I'm an older fan, not in years I've liked Kpop, but in actual physical years on this planet.

And as an older fan (30!), who already graduated from college, I find it impossible to find kpop fans ""in the wild"". 

This may have been discussed before, so I apologize. But, I just wanted to know, how you deal with solitary kpop love? And if you have kpop friends, how do you find them in ""the wild"" outside of donning kpop swag 24/7. Or do you rely entirely on an online family?

&gt;Hello, this is Makestar.

&gt;Thank you once again for having participated in the HIGH4 Mini Album project and for having waited for the HIGH4 reward delivery to begin.

&gt;HIGH4's management agency, N.A.P. Entertainment, has sent an announcement regarding member Kim Sung Gu's exit from the group and reward delivery status.

&gt;Though this may be HIGH4's last album, all rewards will be prepared for delivery in the month of February.


&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Hello, this is N.A.P. Entertainment, HIGH4's managment agency.

&gt;The album resulting from the HIGH4 Mini Album project run last year will finally be released on February 27th.

&gt;We also have a piece of sad news for HIGH4's fans.

&gt;One of the members, Kim Sung Gu, has decided to quit the group following the concert in Japan to promote the album in March. The Japan concert will be the last time the 4 HIGH4 members will perform as a group, so we hope the fans will show lots of support.

&gt;We extend our apology to the fans who have waited a long time for the album, and the time it has taken to deliver the news concerning Kim Sung Gu's decision to leave the group. We wanted to be absolutely clear on his position.

&gt;The rewards from HIGH4's second mini album project at Makestar will be delivered as promised. (In the month of February)

&gt;We would like to thank all the Star Makers for your patience, and are regretful of the news.

&gt;Thank you.",7,39,False,self,,,,,
