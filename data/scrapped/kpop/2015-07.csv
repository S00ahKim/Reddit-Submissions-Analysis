[JYP releases 2nd official statement, ""Han Samin director reps deflecting responsibility... we will move forward with legal action""](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2015/05/follow-up-jyp-releases-second-official.html) 

Basically, after collaborating with 2PM and JYPE about the concept, set, and after scheduling filming dates and agreeing to the cost estimates, the director Han Sa Min cancelled 4 days before the filming date due to the reason stated above. This caused the filming to be delayed because JYPE had to find a new director and find time in 2PM's schedule in between their arena tour in Japan and solo activities. The comeback was shortened due to solo activities in July.

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",1,24

we're a little behind on planning and we don't really want to pay a ton to stay at a hotel for this trip as we're a little tight on funds. if anyone wouldn't mind letting us stay with them at their home that'd be awesome. we could also share a hotel room

we're just two asian dudes from canada who love kpop and play league of legends if that makes us more relate-able.  

don't think this belongs in kpophelp or kpopslumberparty sooo ya plz no removerino. if anyone knows somewhere else i could post this that'd get better results, please let me know. i also know this isn't of interest to the vast majority of this subreddit, but it'd be appreciated if you didn't downvote

She's a terrible singer and does the bare minimum when it comes to dancing. That alone might not bother me too much, since I am a fan of some idols that arent that talented simply because they are entertaining on variety shows and fun to watch like SNSD Sooyoung, but Qri is so quiet that it's easy to forget she exists. Also I know beauty is subjective and some people might argue that she serves as a group visual, but her aegyosal/eyebags freak me out and I just find her face unnatural looking.

I'm also a fan of Mblaq, but Thunder doesnt really have a lot going for him either, being a poor rapper, mediocre dancer and I just find him kind of lacking charisma when it comes to variety shows. I loved Mblaqs idol army  but compared to the other members acting like goofballs Thunder seemed too stiff and uncomfortable.

From what I hear AOA Chanmi, Exo Sehun, Sistar Dasom and 4minute Jihyun also seem to be the less important members of their groups, and I'm interested to know what other idols are seen as the weakest link of their respective group.",173,22

272,2015-7-6,2015,7,6,17,3ca5rd,Hyukoh tops Korean music charts after last Saturday's Infinite Challenge episode,HvDreamer,1436171265,"His song ['Comes and Goes'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECMc1SB60E0&amp;feature=youtu.be) has taken the number one spot across six Korean real-time music charts as of 16:30 (July 6 KST) and is currently ranked 1st on instiz's ichart:  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJNuZo3UwAAqAcT.png

He also has several other songs that are on the charts.  Here are their current ranks on ichart (I've linked the songs so you can listen to them):

* 1: [Comes and Goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECMc1SB60E0&amp;feature=youtu.be)

* 49: [Big Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMfBftG5aZo)

***Source:*** http://ichart.instiz.net/

This happened after last Saturday's Infinite Challenge episode!  

If you didn't know, Infinite Challenge are currently preparing for their upcoming music festival and Hyukoh was among the six music artists who were invited to participate in this big event.  Despite all of the awkward moments with Hyukoh in the episode, he managed to capture the viewer's attention.  It also helped that IU said she was a fan of Hyukoh.  Here's an instagram post of IU with a signed copy of their album:  https://instagram.com/p/3MGU8GAG7z/?taken-by=dlwlrma

I'm happy that he and his band is getting a lot of attention right now.  The band is really good.

Here's his performance from the show:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_VkdGjQUbw

315,2015-7-7,2015,7,7,1,3cbfpt,What do you think are the top K-Pop Female Singer Songs from the 2000s to now?,AssPearAugust,1436200468,"     I was reading this article from soompi the other day about the top female singer songs in kpop of all time. I have pretty big opinions about this so I thought I'd post my list. What songs rank on your guys' top kpop songs? (Only the song, not the choreography or music video).



-4minute: Volume Up (I don't know, the song is just kind of timeless to me. It's one of those songs that hook you at the beginning, and you don't get tired of easily).

-A Pink: I Don't Know (The innocent and fresh sound always left me feeling happy and optimistic. This remains to this day my favorite A Pink song).

-Bestie: Love Options (I don't know how this song didn't get more popular. It's so catchy and lively and somehow it's not like other pretentious kpop dance tracks).

-Girls' Generation: Gee (Obvious reason is obvious. Started the revolution of K-pop pretty much).

-Girl's Day: Something (I've always thought that the song sounded really elegant and beautiful yet catchy despite being a pop song. My favorite Girl's Day song).

-Kara: Mister (One of the songs that defined the golden age of k-pop in my opinion).

-Nine Muses: Wild (It's a perfect pop song with all of the right elements--catchy chorus, beautiful variety of different colors and voices, a rap. I don't know why this song didn't explode either).

-Secret: Poison (I think I have a thing for saxophones. The prominent saxophone really makes the song unique and melodious and the rap is perfectly executed and placed).

-Sistar19: Ma Boy (The simplicity of the instrumental makes the song really charming and easy to listen to, but addictive at the same time).

-Wonder Girls: Nobody (Really defined the Wonder Girls, shame they had to go to America and ruin their bright future in Korea).

-Baek Ah Yeon: Shouldn't Have (Recent song but I can't get over how beautiful this song is. Rare that I get addicted to a song the first time I hear it, but from the start it really makes you attached to it).

-IU: Good Day (Classic, and the three notes never get old).



BONUS:
-Eddy Kim: The Manual (Timeless, beautiful, perfect piece. I get this nostalgic, warm feeling whenever I listen to it--it's so soothing and makes me so emotional somehow).
-Taeyang: Only Look At Me (I think this is my favorite out of all of Taeyang's solo songs. I never get tired of it).

-BONUS 2: Sorry, but all of Mamamoo's songs are just perfect. I can't just pick one ;)

A few weeks ago, I randomly stumbled across [this](http://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=787253241367289) (NSFW)  [[YouTube link]](http://youtu.be/Ncf53TQWYKA?t=2m54s) and it took me a while to realize where I heard it from. It's the same as the beat in [Jimin's Puss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmFmFNn5-OM).

And just today, I was listening to [IU's Monday Afternoon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMZ6KX8etgQ), and the chorus sounded so familiar to me. I finally figured out why  it's similar to [Calvin Harris's Outside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9NQFACZYEU).

Smaller instances:

Orange Caramel's My Copycat [here](http://youtu.be/rqSF_9Zf0n4?t=15s) and T-ARA's Roly Poly [here](http://youtu.be/kowfLIRpQaU?t=47s)

It's the most I've laughed watching an episode of Weekly Idol and it was nonstop. I'm used to some groups showing up who have a few ""variety"" members while the rest are mostly silent and don't participate - but every member of B.A.P. was enjoying themselves immensely. 

Noteworthy scenes:

1. Doni and Coni forcing B.A.P. to keep dancing a strenuous part of Badman while they were quickly tiring out.

2. The butt-measuring contest (something I was genuinely surprised to see happen) and finding out which members had ""uneven"" butts.

3. Youngjae literally breaking into tears after eating his Hanu beef reward.

4. The low-note battle and Himchan tryharding at the end.",52,57

For me, two songs come to mind.
Incredible by Xia, I LOVE this song, but Quincy's part is so ridiculous. I think the song could have had a lot more potential minus ""shaking spaceship candy.""

Haru Haru by BIGBANG (don't hate me!) Don't get me wrong- this is actually probably one of my favorite songs of all time, but while I still adore this song, GD's lines in English are mildly cringeworthy. I'd love to share this song with non-Kpopers, but I think the English holds the song back a little bit.

So, which songs come to mind for you?",111,31

Seriously though, like the title says - what choreography makes you tilt your head just a little bit to the left (or right) when you're watching it and makes you think 'uh, your company could of done a better job for you ladies/gentlemen'

Mine are:

**Stellar - Marionette.** The Butt Scratch dance... *girl* we all thought the same thing probably, but still.


**AoA - Heart Attack.** So in the pre-chorus bit where ChoA is really living for herself, [like at 0:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4alAfL1OcZg), I don't get why Mina and Yuna have to basically run to their spot. It's a really small detail, but it really irks me.

454,2015-7-9,2015,7,9,3,3cku3n,[Discussion] Supporting the ban of netizenbuzz link on /r/kpop,h_yeri,1436379375,"So apparently, I have stumbled upon a surge of netizenbuzz articles recently on this subreddit and am expressing my views regarding this matter. I would like to state that the followings are just my own views, so do feel free to counter my views if I am wrong, etc. Also, I have seen several users expressing their views regarding netizenbuzz submission, so I guess this discussion should be where the users can submit their views on, rather than on individual netizenbuzz article submission. Perhaps mods can join in too and come to a peaceful conclusion.  
  
To remind you guys again, the following are just my personal views.   
  
+ To kick things off, netizenbuzz is just a blog with comments gathered from the netizens. And in fact, most of the comments on the web link are actually rude/trash comments gathered from around the net. And simply providing the source where you get the views from doesn't make your article any better to be honest.  
  
As per stated in the submission rules on the subreddit, ""Blog submissions are allowed but must provide **original and k-pop related content**."" Are netizenbuzz articles considered original then if you were to gather personal views from knetz?   

+ Most or rather all of the articles are basically attacking an individual or a kpop group. I believe that the subreddit here was made to gather kpop related news so that kpop fans who were busy with school, work, etc. can catch up on the latest happenings in Kpop rather than to actually click on ""new"" and scroll through a series of articles defaming any kpop groups/artistes.  
  
+ Also, we are basically helping netizenbuzz achieving more clicks to the website. And in a way, the author of the blog is in a win-win situation isn't it? Gathering all the hates for kpop groups and earning money at the same time. ~~In fact we are helping him earn more money because he runs ads on his website too~~   

Do remember that afterall, we are all one kpop community.   

**Frankly speaking, I really don't wish to see this kpop subreddit turn into a tabloid subreddit.**

^Note: ^The ^respective ^weekly ^charts ^have ^slighty ^different ^cut-off ^times ^\(ichart: ^06/29-07/05, ^Melon: ^06/29-07/05, ^Gaon: ^06/28-07/04)


**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",13,21

- There are 11 Celebrity Judges and 88 Audience members who have votes.
- Singers are drawn into a tournament style bracket, where they will be competing against each other to advance to the final round.
- Singers are masked, hence the show name Mask King. The audience and judges do not know their identity. When they have to speak, their voices are also distorted. The only way to identify someone before they reveal themselves is through their singing voice, physical appearance, or body language.
- The 11 Celebrity Judges and 88 audience voters will vote on which of the 2 singers was the most captivating, and sang better. The winner continues on to the next round, the loser has their identity revealed and is eliminated.

This week's judges:

- Kim Sung Joo
- Kim Gura
- Kim Hyung Seok
- Kim Do Kyun
- B1A4 Sandeul
- Shin Bong Sun
- Verbal Jint
- Ji Sang Ryul
- Lee Yoon Seok
- Lim Chang Ryul
- Dal Shabet Subin
- Nine Muses Kyungri


Round 1 format: The two singers sing a duet, and the loser performs the song that they would have sang in the second round, while revealing themselves.

I guess I'll start with my opinion. I've only listened to the album through twice at this point so take my opinions with a grain of salt.

1. [** (Just Right)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrdk3IGcau8) - The song is cute and meaningful and the MV is even cuter! It's one of their best title tracks to date and I can't wait to see them promote it.
2. [**Before the Full Moon Rises   **](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAHGIelcH6s) - This is a really solid song, I like the chorus a lot. I like the feel the song gives. It fits in really well with the album.
3. [**My Whole Body is Reacting  **](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Rq8eAgMg4) - Tentatively my favorite song off the album. Like I could definitely listen to it on repeat for awhile and everyone sounds great. I love how it sounds.
4. [**Nice**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EzeNJTUcEg) - Starting off I wasn't too impressed, but it's nice variation for the album. It feels kind of strange honestly (in a confusing sort of good way) and more reminiscent of their Got It? stuff. Nothing really special but definitely not bad.
5. [**Mine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0ziMC6YZWw) - Out of all their songs, this one felt the most cookie cutter, especially compared with their older stuff. It doesn't stand out for me too much but the second half is better than the first half imo. 
6. [**Back to Me**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJx2A3S8-wo) - A fun sound to end the album. The beginning still sounds like Tender Love to me haha. I like it. It's lighthearted and I like when they sound like they're enjoying it. 

**TL;DR:** *This album is the answer to the prayers of all IGot7 basically. It is really solid if you ask me, and I hope they find a lot of success with it. If nothing else, it's progress.*

Every once in a while a second or third class group might get lucky and comeback just at the right time when everyone else is sitting at home. 

I wonder if EXID or Red Velvet well come back and steal the show again like they did in the spring and winter time. Maybe the older groups like KARA, TARA, or maybe even Secret can steal the show a win.

&gt; ^(Comment: *Links maybe temporary and will replace/update once MBC uploads them on their own channel. Please note that MBCkpop youtube uploads selective performances and does not post all of the performances on its channel.*)

&gt; ^(**1:** *Honestly* ***is not MONSTA X's comeback. They are promoting this as a special stage for this week.***)

&gt; ^(***I'm sorry for the incomplete post. Uploader missed about 2/3 of the show. So I'm unable to obtain the majority of the Daum links and other cuts of the show. I'll update this thread with the official links after work [12 hours from now]. If you want to check them out beforehand, MBC should have them up soon. In the event that they don't upload the performances, I'll find the links either way:***) [^MBC ^Music ^YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/imbcmusic/videos)

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",2,19

- Removing Hwayoung's rap in Roly-Poly.

- Making the super-catchy part (1:11 onwards) in Rainbow's Black Swan appear once again later on in the song. Extending Woori's rap and removing Hyunyoung's belting part right after it.

- Made the mix not so brickwalled in both Sistar's Alone and AOA's Like A Cat.

- Removed the dated (it shows the heavy reliance during that time period) autotune in both Super Junior's Sorry Sorry and Big Bang's Tonight.

Edit: I hope people aren't getting the wrong impression here. I'm only stating opinions on songs I really like and was curious about what those in /r/kpop would give as answers.

G-Dragon - Heartbreaker and Secret - Look At Me sound a lot like Flo Rida's Right Round. (which itself samples You Spin Me Around by Dead Or Alive)

[B.A.P - What The Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NOQBjEA_4w) has a sound distinct of Linkin Park during their Hybrid Theory era.

[Day By Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubg4wW6JXVk) by T-ara sounds like [Britney's Criminal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6b33PTbGxk)

[B.A.P's 1004/Angel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGolQ9LzbkY) has instrumentation that reminds me of [Counting Stars by OneRepublic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_nvWreIhg)

[Dal Shabet - B.B.B.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGKeA3xUzxU) sounds like [Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMFqkcPYcg)

[Orange Caramel's Lipstick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z9R57maGvc) reminds me of Electroswing music.

[T-ara's Like The First Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWSTtFoD0Ms) sounds like something La Roux would have released in 2008-2009.

Stuff like this is why I love some Kpop. It takes stuff I'm familiar with and puts its own twist on it.",79,60

It might be her hair or the fact she starts the song in the middle with sass, but it feels as if every time I'm watching their stage, she stands out. 

Similarly with Apink's Remember which kinda highlights Hayoung and Bomi whilst No No No had Na Eun written all over it.

What other song-member correlation can you think of?

Edit: I apologise. I realised I worded this really badly and what I was referring to wasn't exactly members who dominate every song. On the contrary, it's about which member you associate with each song (because they were most prominent/had the best style/new hairstyle), e.g. Hot Summer - Krystal or Crazy - Jiyoon/Sohyun",76,18

1. [+632, -59] On physical body alone, they're probably the top when it comes to boy groups

2. [+624, -59] 2PM's probably the top of boy groups when it comes to physical bodies!

3. [+560, -52] 2PM suits Running Man so well because they have the stamina and variety skills for it

4. [+44, -10] Today was hilarious  the clothes did a lot 

5. [+30, -11] Judging by their bodies, they must've worked out a ton consistently..

Tablo's label is called ""HIGH GRND"" (It is meant to say High Ground, but on their teaser video they use HIGH GRND) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTJ7IxyvOcQ

[+12184, -292] Heol crazy jackpot.... This is so awesome. HIGH GRND be successful~ 

[+11090, -200] Ah.. goes to Tablo. Is that why they came out together on Show Me The Money 

[+7265, -206] Good good they're on a roll!!!

[+6810, -757] Heol Tablo's side is good but then what was the situation at Hyukoh's original agency???

[+5024, -169] Wowww good good please let us hear lots of good songs!

[+1101, -177] Tajinyo's revival is really bothersome. Tajinyo, despite being sued and all, continue to spurt out some Galileo Galilei nonsense and still think Tablo fabricated his educated like real psychopaths.

[+950, -44] There's nothing better than entering YG... Yang Hyun Suk will provide support for HIGH GRND... 

**'Mask King' Kim Yeon Woo, Finally Takes off Cleopatra... New King 'Tongki'**

entertain.naver.com/ranking/read?oid=213&amp;aid=0000727272

[+23383, -367] Over the past 10 weeks my ears have been very happy... Fighting Cleopatra..

[+20057, -411] Kim Yeon Woo really is Korea's best vocal! You've worked very hard.

[+16794, -322] Kim Yeon Woo, Thank you very much for your effort! I sincerely hope people you can show people you are the best once more.

[+15291, -513] Yeon Woo God has fallen. 

[+13430, -287] Yeon Woo God you've worked hard ~~~~ So enjoyable.

[+4485, -198] This was voluntary... 

[+4204, -95] Today Kim Yeon Woo had an honorary graduation that no one else can match.

[+3740, -118] Listening to 'For 500 Years' I seriously got goosebumps and tears came out. Tongki also did very well but Cleopatra, I really couldn't say anything. God Yeon Woo, Yeon Woo God, in the future, fighting!

[+3575, -89] 10 weeks later sing an encore  I'm so sad I could die.

**'Mask King' 'Tongki', 91 Votes vs. 8 Votes, The highest vote difference to advance to the next round**

entertain.naver.com/ranking/read?oid=421&amp;aid=0001533142

[+5510, -240] God Lee Jung....... Yuju's match was just too unfavorable.

[+3600, -171] Really good... Yuju also thank you very much~

[+3204, -102] Wow I seriously got goosebumps watching the TV.

[+2943, -283] Never dreamed of it being G-Friend's Yuju.

[+2810, -846] The 8 votes were from family. Her friends came...

[+831, -41] I know Lee Jung did well on Immortal Song and I Am a Singer but today's stage was just the best.

[+723, -34] There's a reason that that there was an honorary graduation. God Yeon Woo got a casting offer~ Thank you for letting us listen to good music, Mask King producers~

[+702, -24] Right from the start of the song you can tell it's Lee Jung's voice 

[+651, -40] God Lee Jung seriously gave me goosebumps 

[+570, -34] Tongki gave me goosebumps... Really came out with the best ever stage.

**'Mask King' Jaws' Identity is Tei, the Ballad Prince is Returning**

entertain.naver.com/ranking/read?oid=213&amp;aid=0000727266

[+3570, -41] Really listened well to you, Tei

[+2893, -32] Tei  Really listened to your song well 

[+2172, -30] All Tei it's been a long time 

[+2069, -45] Unfortunate  Really really listened well 

[+1692, -383] Tei also sang well but Tongki is out of your league;;;

[+446, -8] Tei has improved a lot since I last saw him

[+405, -7] Attractive voice~~ It'll kill you!!

[+350, -5] Many people listen to Tei's songs but not many people know who he is

[+353, -22] God Yeon Woo descended as a Pansori singer (Pansori is a genre of music that is composed of a vocal and a drummer)

**'Mask King' PD Min Chul Ki Counts the Best 5 Performances**

&gt;&gt; 'Phantom of the Opera' = CBR Cleopatra (Kim Yeon Woo) + Storm and Wind Unicorn (Bae Da Hae)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqbG7nlbfq8

&gt;&gt; 'If By Chance' = CBR Cleopatra (Kim Yeon Woo)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghKXL6HmQWU

&gt;&gt; 'If' = Fly Taekwon Boy (Kwon In Ha)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGaLui330bY

&gt;&gt; 'Don't Touch Me' = Self-Censored Mosaic (EXID Solji) + Self-Stunning 14K (Shin Bora) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykx7SO7TrZg

&gt;&gt; 'Feeling Only You' = Hardware Store Boss (Hong Seok Chun) + SangAmDong Whistle (Block B Taeil)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDGOxCDt-3g

[+6761, -212] Bae Da Hye and Kim Yeon Woo's vote difference was just 1 vote. Bae Da Hye is also amazing.

[+4508, -68] Personally I think Mask King's best reversals were Hong Seok Chun and Baek Chung Kang  Definitely did not think it would be them...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op14RpxxhUQ

[+4208, -317] Really really sorry for Bae Da Hye... If it wasn't for Kim Yeon Woo she would be the king.... I really like her tone.

[+2914, -109] Lee Jung's second round was also awesome and Kim Yeon Woo is the best. (King of Singing Tungki is highly suspected to be Lee Jung)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XifQvJbX2GQ&amp;feature=youtu.be

[+2640, -50] Honestly there are a lot of best performances..........

[+299, -11] Definitely more fun than 'I Am a Singer'

[+290, -9] I really like Jo Jang Hyuk's 'Please' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAA_W1nF3iE

[+306, -31] For me it's Yeon Woo God's 'Can't Have You'... Really admire that myself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSVCyTExGxw

[+268, -23] 'Phantom of the Opera' was amazing

A couple months ago I started making a sound pack for the game. The sound pack I'm making is made completely from kpop songs that I've learned to love and enjoy, but I've reached an impasse. First let me explain.

Recursion Stat Tracker is an ingame overlay used to see how well one is doing while playing Planetside 2. This stat tracker has unique sounds that it plays when the player gets an achievement. Here are some examples using the kpop sound pack that I've been working on. (It's still in beta btw so there are still some non-kpop sounds in it)

[Example 1](https://youtu.be/-2WGFqtMKe8)

[Example 2 Edit: The videos don't  actually pop up in the corners. I just put those there for hype](https://youtu.be/CQM0g4V8NEc)

So now that I've (sort of) explained how it works this is where I need to ask for help. My kpop reservoir is empty. I can't think of anymore songs to match the remaining ribbons. So if you are interested in helping, link me some interesting songs. They can be calm and mellow or super jumpy and fun. Your favorite. Your least favorite. Honestly, anything helps and it'll go a long way in helping me finally finish.

Addition: If you'd like to help even more then feel free to look through the list of medals/achievements [here](https://recursiontracker.com/?p=c&amp;c=achievements) and pm me with songs you think that would match them well.

I'd like to thank you all in advance. FIGHTING!",20,25

^Note: ^The ^respective ^weekly ^charts ^have ^slighty ^different ^cut-off ^times ^\(ichart: ^07/13-07/19, ^Melon: ^07/13-07/19, ^Gaon: ^07/12-07/18)


**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",14,21

**Best:**

- [4minute's Crazy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY) 

I'm not the biggest fan of the song itself, but the mastering is incredible. The only instrument that overpowers the others in the mix is the bass drum - and that's purely a stylistic choice that fits well with the attitude of the song and its trap stylings.

This is one of those songs that are rewarding to listen to on a good audio setup. The the piano and acoustic guitar sit perfectly in the laid back mix and every instrument fill can be heard clearly whenever it shows up.

- [f\(x\) - Rum Pum Pum Pum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnku4o3tRB4)

I feel like most of f(x)'s recordings are mixed and mastered really well, but for the sake of having a list entry I have chosen this one. There is a lot of intensity in this song that could have been completely lost if it was mastered like one of the songs in my worst-of list. 

The amount of instrumentation in this song is also really impressive, especially for Kpop where the reliance on simple patterns is still prevalent. Just listening to the percussion and vocal combination in the outro makes me grateful that SM's production team didn't drop the ball. Another SM song that has great production and percussion is [Red Velvet's Happiness.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFgv8bKfxEs)

-[ Secret - I'm In Love.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpatVVhT-Io)

Duble Sidekick did Secret's signature sound justice in this, the whole mixing of new and old with the brass instruments and synths. As with the others, everything can be heard clearly on a good audio setup - especially the funky bass playing that makes the song for me.

- [Kara - Mamma Mia!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tK0XUQQ3wA)

Besides just being a fantastic and catchy song, Duble Sidekick's production on this is great. As with I'm In Love, his (or someone at his company's) bass playing really stands out and adds a really ""alive"" and funky sound to the song. It chugs along during the entire song and everything else is built around it very, very clearly. 

- [B.A.P - What The Hell.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NOQBjEA_4w)

This is one of B.A.P's earlier songs when they seemed to be set on doing the aggressive concept only. The reason it stands out to me is because, first of all, it blows away Power (the title track) away as a song and because it has more dynamics than B.A.P's other aggressive songs. 

Himchan, who some might say is/was underrepresented in B.A.P's vocals, provides a stellar bass vocal line in the chorus that jumps out of the mix. The instrumentation during the verses reminds me of old Linkin Park, with the delicate melodies bouncing around the vocals. The production effectively puts a nu-metal song in Kpop production, making everything glisten and sound simply ""pleasing"" to the ear.

- [Big Bang - If You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IaobolPNX8)

The emotion of the song makes it for most people, but what really stood out to me is how choruses morphed into something that sounded like a cross between Oasis (except better produced) and the Beatles. That mellotron sound that comes in later on the song is a more cleaned up version of what you can hear during the intro of [Strawberry Fields Forever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nehRB1FTeTo)

The acoustic guitar picking is another thing that carries on throughout the song and its place in the mix is essential. There was never a point where it got buried under everything else and even the fret scrapes were audible throughout, which is a personal preference for me.

- [Park Gyuri / From The Airport - The Little Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwP7jplJY5Y)

This isn't strictly Kpop, as it's a band that collaborated with a Kpop singer, but the production is noteworthy. This laid back electronic rock number has clean instrumentation that you won't overlook in the mix. The delicate clean guitar playing benefits from this and reminds me of David Gilmour's work on The Wall. It morphs into a full on banger later on in the song. 

My only gripe would be wanting some backing vocals from the band members too.

**Worst:**

**Kpop is pop music, so the emphasis on slick production is almost a given. I'm sure I'll see a flood of responses with great production in the comments below.** 

**However, it really takes something to mess up production in this genre. A particularly unforgivable production sin is brickwalling, where all the instruments and vocals are cranked up to sound ""louder"" on whatever you're listening to it to. This is at the expense of dynamics and the audio can sound mashed, fatiguing and even be prone to intense clipping.** 

**My favourite band is Metallica and I still can't believe they released their last album, Death Magnetic, in such a horrible brickwalled state. Anyways, on to my picks in Kpop.**

- [Girl's Day - Ring My Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4sN05-xIs4)

This song tries to do too many things at once to the point where it sounds like cacophony. I'm not even going to argue about whether it's a nicely written song, that isn't the point of this discussion. However, it was fatiguing on first listen and the extremely fast hi-hat in the chorus left me stunned that anyone could consider it a good idea. 

Vocally, there is so much going on at the same time and it isn't in a way where it can be distinguished in a comfortable manner. Not to hate on the genre, but at some points it sounded like I was listening to one of those vocoder songs that go on one speed only.

- [Sistar - Alone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ZHXVp_wUE)

Before I start, I really like this song. It was one of the first Kpop songs that I couldn't deny was addictive, back in my hater days. That being said, you know there's trouble when even the guitar line in the intro clips a few times. The mix is brickwalled, with the vocals sounding shrill in some parts and the background strings not having as much impact as they could because it's all one volume.

- [AOA - Like A Cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEYOyZVWlzs)

Here's another song I like that I wish Brave Brothers (who also did Sistar's Alone) would have dialed back the mix a bit. 

The acoustic guitar sounds like someone played the chords once and then looped them. And I don't mean played the accompaniment to a section and then CTRL+V'd it somewhere else in the song, because that is commonplace with a good take. I mean that it literally sounds like someone played, for example, the G chord (which may not be in the song, just using an example) once and then cut it into a sliver - a chord ""stab"" that was then copied all over the song so that it doesn't sound natural at all.

On top of that, it's brickwalled and is filled with a lot of unnecessary noise and male vocal fills. (Not even hating on the guy like this subreddit likes to do but this is a tedious trademark of his)

Honourable mention to [AOA's Heart Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pBgMBBsv4k) for having too much treble in its mix. The vocals sound cold and piercing in places. I'm also basing this on the album version, the music video has even worse audio.

[T-ara - Yayaya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLfRdyqxXJk)

This song is a train wreck production wise.

[B.A.P - 1004/Angel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGolQ9LzbkY)

This is one of my favourite songs by them but the mix is horrible. The drums are way too loud and it is the complete production opposite of what I praised earlier in their song [What The Hell.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NOQBjEA_4w)

There are no dynamics and the ""quiet"" parts where the ""You Look like an Angel"" line is sung are rushed. This song could have benefited heavily if there wasn't such a NEED for Kpop songs to be under four minutes in length. It should have been extended a bit and had more dynamics - and have the dial turned down on various knobs on the mixing board.

**That's my list that I can think of at the moment. For a bonus in this discussion, post what you use to listen to Kpop. While writing this list and checking out the songs (in FLAC quality just so I could be sure) I used a Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro and a Schiit Asgard 2.** 

**Edit: Also, in case someone thinks my opinion on Heart Attack having too much treble is because of my headphones (which are known for having a V shaped sound with recessed mids and emphasized bass and treble) - I also had the same opinion when using my Sennheiser HD600. (which are very neutral)**

Those can be included though. The changes can be anything.

One of the biggest (natural or not) changes I've seen is Jun Hyosung. [Up to 2011](http://i.imgur.com/XAljkei.jpg), she was known as the curvaceous leader of Secret with her cute cheeks. [In 2012, she lost a lot of weight](https://kpopgirlsinindia.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/550416_429427820454950_1110163931_n.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=) and even garnered haters online who told her that they hated her without her famous cheeks. 

Since then, she [gained weight again for the I'm In Love promotions](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EOu7MsqSnxs/U-iWtjL_trI/AAAAAAAACxc/HGNmvLyDU80/s1600/SECRET_01.jpg) but [then lost a lot again.](https://instagram.com/p/5LiKLLTeEL/?taken-by=secrettimehs)

Her groupmates, Hana and Sunhwa, have had a lot of surgery done that makes them look starkly different from the old days.",183,64

To the people who are curious about my abrupt departure from TD-G here is my story. As a foreigner in K-Pop I faced a lot of racism and hardships during my time in SE. Constant verbal abuse and physical assault from a TD-G member and managers left me quite depressed and made me change my mind about wanting to debut in Korea. I felt very alone during my time there, and didn't feel happy while doing what should of made me the happiest. I didn't get to go to Beijing and left abruptly which is why information on me just ended. I'm not saying SE is a bad company, there were a few staff members and TD family members who are truly great people and it's a shame that things had to end the way they did. Though I felt a lot of regret and sadness at first, I am extremely blessed to be where I am now and grateful for the past experiences I've had in SE. I'm in a great company now and I'm working even harder to my dream and future debut. Please support me and also TD in our future activities! #confessions #strongerthanever #practicinghard # # #](https://instagram.com/p/5p3ZDHID-X/?taken-by=cavan_cc)",42,81

1601,2015-7-30,2015,7,30,6,3f2ueh,State of the Subreddit - Feedback Welcome,JessiTee,1438204012,"Hi /r/kpop. A discussion about the rules of this subreddit has been a long time coming, so I've made this post for the mods to talk about some proposed changes / rule ideas for the sub. We also want the community to give their opinion on the current state of the subreddit, and give us feedback on any proposed changes.

Apologies for the long list, but here's a list of suggested changes that the mods have come up with (after much deliberation!):

### 1.  Discussion posts should ask questions that you can't easily imagine answers or reactions to.
* Our view: A discussion where every response would be lists of songs, groups, idols, etc usually does not result in any kind of interesting content.
* Who/What is your favorite X is not an acceptable discussion hook, since its overly familiar noise to most. I've written a tentative rule on the sidebar in an attempt to filter out these kinds of posts.
* Furthermore, overly familiar subject matter is noise to most of the subscribers, because the conversion period from new-to-kpop to knowledgeable is very short.

### 2. Discussions should not revolve around a users personal situation (except perhaps giveaways, ticket selling, etc. if appropriately tagged)
### 3. Submission titles must directly and concisely introduce the topic of discussion. No one-word titles. Additional context should be given in the self-text of a post, if necessary.
### 4.  Simple questions, like asking for a song to be identified, or asking for song recommendations, should be posted on /r/kpophelp.
* Our view: since these threads usually dont spark much actual discussion wed prefer them to be posted in a subreddit thats more oriented towards answering beginner questions. We want to ask subscribers: Do you think that song or playlist recommendations belong in this category?
* Although people complain that /r/kpophelp is not as active as /r/kpop, it still gets posts daily and most questions are answered. /r/kpics started as a spinoff from /r/kpop and it is quite successful now, so we dont see why the same cannot happen with /r/kpophelp (and kpopslumberparty)

### 5. Regarding group-specific content: We are unsure which content belongs on group-specific subreddits, e.g. commercials, short variety show clips, single member fancams, etc. 
* This technically is under the umbrella of the ""relevancy"" rule - i.e.  is a fancam of Bomi relevant here, or would it better belong on the APink subreddit?

### 6. Flair should be a much more essential element of the subreddit and we plan to implement post filters based on tags.
* Suggested tags (including existing ones): MV, Live, Audio, Dance Cover, Song Cover, Teaser, Remix, Fluff, Variety, Meta
* We would have stricter title and formatting rules for certain types of content (no more Big Bang performs three songs on Sketchbook)
* No all-caps titles. All-caps words or phrases are only allowed they match the official spelling of an artists name, song or album title
* We ideally will include formatting examples for every type of submission in submission help text.

### 7. Idea: Daily discussion threads as a catch-all for submissions like Im new to kpop, whos going to this particular concert that users are dying to post (basically a new FFA every day). What Are You Listening To? will still be on Wednesdays.

### 8. Music Show Posts: Only post debut / comeback stages as well as special stages outside of the compilation posts (not an official rule yet, but wed like to make it one).


Wed love to hear feedback on our ideas, as well as more suggestions from our subscribers.",207,75

What do they think about it?,sunRaeTX,1438205013,"I know this sounds like a dumb question, but I hear a lot of people face criticism from friends and such because they listen to foreign music. Often because they do not personally know others who have the same intersest or understand the interest for kpop. It may also depend on how much one impliments the music/kpop lifestyle into their everyday lives (casual listener vs. shove-kpop-down-my-family-and-friends-throat listeners.

1628,2015-7-30,2015,7,30,13,3f4d5y,A breakdown of how many albums a Kpop group would have to sell to break even,dankychanmi,1438229599,"A couple of days ago there was a post about how After School is probably not going to have a comeback for a long time because of Pledis' money issues. In my mind After School has always been really success and a comeback was the best way to being income to the company. So I became curious: **How many albums/singles does a group have to sell to break even?** This includes the cost of:

* Buying a song off a composer/producing a song themselves
* Making the MV
* Showcases
* Comebacks stages
* Outfits
* Etc


~~I really enjoy looking at different kpop groups discography wiki pages to see how many singles/albums they sell.~~


So I looked at After School's [discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_School_discography) only to find they sold 

* +10,445,522 singles (not including any song before 2009 as the information was missing) (jp + kr releases)
* +64,386 full albums (jp + kr releases)
* +10,122 compliation albums (jp)
* +97,602 EPs (kr)
* +1680 DVDs (jp)

[Orange Caramel discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Caramel)

* +25,243 studio albums (jp + kr)
* +8,243 EPs (kr)
* +10,686,289 singles (kr)
* +25,974 singles (jp)

This doesn't even include any potential money made through CFs or concerts. At this point I was thinking ""How is it even possible for them not to have a comeback."" So I looked into the cost of a typical Kpop comeback. 

* MVs cost anywhere from $90 000 to $500 000 (ie Kara's step = $100 000, Sistar's loving u = $172 000, Tara's cry cry =$1 000 000)
* Recording/buying a song = 5%-10% or total budget/ $1000-$30 000 ~~(couldn't find a clear cut number of what top producers like Brave Brothers, Sweetune, Shinsadong Tiger, etc)~~
* Showcases = $8 000
* Advertising: billboards = $5 000-$1 000 000 (depending on area population/ number of billboards), TV CFs = $1500 (local tv stations) - $350 000 (national tv/prime time/sports), teasers = $1000-$5000 ~~x5541387 if your exo~~

Your average Kpop comeback would cost about **$250 000 - +$750 000**. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm missing other hidden costs.


Now if I take After School latest ~~3 years late~~ comeback ['First Love'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmS3Qh_SFwU). The MV has three very expensive box sets with shower closeups of all of the members, the song was produced by Brave Brothers (pretty high end on the Kpop producer scale) and the pole dancing concepts took months of preparation. A super rough estimate of the 'First Love' comeback would be **$400 000 - $500 000**.


Now if I look at how many singles it was 596 000. Most likely all of those singles were sold digitally therefore the music distributing company (melon, itunes, etc) takes a cut. Let's say Pledis gets to keep 65 cents for every copy of 'First Love' sold. That equates to 596 000 * 0.65 = **$387,400** and if our comeback estimate is $400k - $500k then Pledis lost anywhere from **$12,600 - $112,600**. In order for After School to break even they would've had to sell about **615 384 - 769 230** singles.


I know that that idols can make income through CFs, sponsors, events, dramas, shows, etc. But this is off number is purely based on how many albums are needed to be sold. So before people go off saying ""to just give them a comeback"" they need to understand how much of a risk companies take when they give they idol group a comeback (don't even get me started on a debuting a group). Also I just used After School as my example because they are a really good example of a group that's popularity went straight up then down. ~~but i'm still waiting Pledis~~

I bring this up now because I only recently found out about The Ark's The Light and I think that a debut like that is a pretty noble one to make in the current K-Pop market. So I ask, let's share some songs that always make you a little teary-eyed when they're done playing. 

My suggestion to the list would have to be Ladies Code I'm Fine Thank You. It always makes me reflect on the people who I care about in my life.

**Background**

***Why iChart?***

iChart takes the rankings of nine major Korean digital charts (e.g. Melon, Mnet, Bugs, Oriba, olleh) and calculates how a song is doing overall on all charts. It is a weekly cumulative chart that assigns hourly points to major online chart performances from 12:30 a.m. every Monday to 11:30 p.m. every Sunday and aggregates the points into scores. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.instiz.net/iframe_ichart_score.htm?week=1&amp;selyear=2015&amp;sel=18)

***Why Melon?***

Of all the mentioned charts not all digital charts carry the same weight. There are three major charts in South Korea: Melon, Bugs and Mnet. They account for over 50% of the digital market share, and Melon is probably the biggest and most important single digital chart ranking. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://www.melon.com/chart/week/)

***Why Gaon?***

Gaon Charts, similar to iChart, also combine all other digital charts but do not rank average chart performance like iChart but ""cold hard facts"". The ranks are based mainly on total streaming and download numbers in any given week. Gaon Charts are the ""most official charts"". Think about them as the Korean equivalent of the Billboard Charts. [\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?nationGbn=T&amp;serviceGbn=ALL)

***Why Gaon Album Charts?***

So far all the charts represented only give you an impression of the digital power of single songs. The Gaon Album Charts give you an impression of how well newly released physical albums are selling. Naturally you will only be able to find albums here, no singles. Physical sales are a good indicator of the strength of a fanbase. I'm using the version of the album charts that includes domestic AND global sales (e.g. why the Chinese version of EXODUS is charting so high).[\(Source for Ranking\)](http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T)",4,30

Rap battles that I've seen one too many times with a bunch of wannabe hip hop stars that I'm pretty sure are just yelling pre-made lyrics that don't actually consist of any actual rap battle presence. BUT HEY, this is Mnet America, we can forgive and forget for playing this disgraceful show, it just makes it hard to forget when the same episodes are played every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (shout-out to ZE:A Mazeltov here for reminding me of the days of the week). BUT HAVE NO FEAR when even Mnet gets tired of the rappers we can just have Superstar K 2010 episodes again ~ and all the lonely amnesic people said: ""WOOOOOOO!""

ONTO the Jung Sisters. I don't have much to say here because I'm a heart throbbing, love seeking, SNSD overlord who would love to be captured by the Jung Sisters even if they are part of 2 plastic groups that are losing more parts than my secret childhood vintage barbie doll. 

THERE MUST BE VARIETY RIGHT? What about all the K-Dramas and the Saturday night movies?
OH, you must be referring to the few dramas they weren't too lazy to sub and release months and years after they were originally televised! And as for the movies, I'll give you that one, you got me there, you win this time Mnet.

Listen, I like to watch the occasional 500 hours marathon commercial that's trying to sell me a blender that's the size of a cupcake, and I don't mind the occasional rerun of Seinfeld, The Office or any other show, but vomit is vomit and this channel is spreading its cheeks and vomiting out the butt crack right now with the same shiz I saw go down its mouth 24 hrs ago.

Mnet America -

LETS START A RIOT - but not really. This is more of a Craigslist missed connection and I'm just trying to find the other 5 people who are also watching this twilight zone channel and punching themselves in the face. And to all of you, I say -
 ""Hey, wanna change the channel sometime?"" ",0,0
