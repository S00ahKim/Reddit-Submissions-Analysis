102,2016-4-2,2016,4,2,9,4cz5ab,[Discussion] Best Headphone Kpop Songs?,aornic,1459557281,"I suppose I should clarify what I mean by this. There are songs you know are just for blasting on speakers - bangers like Expectation by Girl's Day come to mind.

But what about songs with a huge amount of nuance and layering going on? Those sound best on a good pair of headphones and I wanted to know what you all would consider your favourite songs in such a capacity.

Just a quick list of my own.

* B.A.P - Easy
* Big Bang - If You (That mellotron used in the second half is very Beatles-esque.
* CLC - Pepe (vocal layering is sublime on a pair of headphones with good mids reproduction.
* The entire 4walls album by f(x).
* GOT7 - If You Do (has a good atmosphere)
* Oh My Girl - Closer. (some of the best atmosphere in Kpop - pure dreampop)
* Psy - The Day Will Come. (Feat. Jun In Kwon)
* Rainbow - Black Swan. (the song that inspired this list honestly)
* Red Velvet - Cool World,  Somethin' Kinda Crazy &amp; Automatic. (the latter two have some of the best Michael Jackson production vibes in Kpop that I've heard.
* Secret - I'm In Love, Talk That. (chock full of hooks left and right and great bass guitar work)
* SHINee - Like A Fire, View.
* Suran - I Feel.
* Taeyang - Love You To Death.
* T-ara - Again 1977.

124,2016-4-2,2016,4,2,15,4d0hjo,[Dance Analysis] f(x),sq02,1459579210,"Hello everyone! this is just a quick analysis of f(x)'s dance ability in general. I do classical dance mainly, but also have been doing more and more contemporary and hip hop these past few years.

Their dances are complex and technical. You have to have a solid foundation in dance to be able to look good when doing their dances because they require a precision and control that must be honed through previous experience. Although they do not have as much ""bounce"" (they did when they were rookes) as a whole as Red Velvet do, they are powerful and clean yet relaxed and are very synchronized.
 
Some f(x) choreo may look deceptively simple because each member has this strong foundation, and the sheer number of small details which require good technique can make their dances much harder than they seem. Even pinnochio, regarded as one of their easiest choreographies, has lots of sharp popping and fast movements (to see how hard it is to get the precision of f(x), look at 4minutes cover of pinnochio lol). f(x) as a group at their dancing best is extremely clean, synchronized and strong. In rum pum pum pum, detailed hand movements and agility are needed. In Nu ABO, the complex footwork needs to be well executed while doing the difficult already upper body moves. Like red velvet, it helps a lot to have 2 immensely talented dancers and 2 others that are strong dancers in their own right. Like f(x) itself, each member has a unique dancing style. For example, Luna is extremely powerful and swift in her dancing, while Victoria has a certain gracefulness and soft agility to her steps. Overall, f(x) have a mellow energy to them that makes them precise yet relaxed and very synchronized, even when performing their technically challenging complex choreo.

note at 0:49, if you focus on victoria, and then luna, and then krystal and so on, you can see just how different each member's style is.

148,2016-4-3,2016,4,3,2,4d2bji,/r/KoreanMusic's Indie picks for February and March 2016,Nokel,1459616898,"[Previous Installment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/43qbcc/my_korean_indie_picks_for_december_2015_and/) (December and January)

I didn't get many suggestions this week (I had [made a post on /r/KoreanMusic asking for suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanmusic/comments/4cfwnx/post_your_favorite_korean_indie_songs_from/)), so once again this list will mainly be comprised of songs that I like!

[Electronic] [Goldmund - One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1G2EKWAP7Q)

&gt; This song has a sort of ""retro"" feel to it, which I really like. The way the singer fluctuates the volume of his voice ('punching' certain notes and the backing off) gives the song a really cool effect.

[Rock] [Tonics - Song Of The Dead Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oePRAqwYUEQ)

&gt;  This is a really mellow and 'spacey' tune. The singer isn't the greatest but I think that just adds to the feel of the song. 

[Synth Pop] [Daybreak - Mellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atstFjRxf4c)

&gt; The perfect song for Spring! Everything about it is upbeat and happy.

[Rock] [Stellarjet - Guiding Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EORGbefYcEU)

&gt; 100% in English! There's a whole lot going on in the instrumental which is really interesting to listen to. It's definitely one of my favorite songs of 2016.

[Indie Rock] [Fantastic Drugstore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXYSfZbHJcA)

&gt; This dude's falsetto's are so cool!  

/u/FluxusJeffrey suggested the next two songs and said that the MVs go together. Please watch them in this order:

[Annyeongbada - Tear Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9DPf9zIrrI)

&gt;The line of hope and dreams that I finally grabbed has been cut like this. I was so scared and fearful that I would miss this opportunity. I was shocked and I didn't know what to do because of this new situation. No matter how much I told the truth and was wronged, it as meaningless. You all made me lose the time that I spent trying to bury the truth even though I was wronged. You cornered me and forced me, the weaker one. You used the heart of someone who was scared to lose everything, you never listened to the truth, and you accepted it as meaningless. Even if I turn back time, as the weak, I wouldn't have changed. My heart that had to stay silent because it as scared it would leave a scratch wasn't alive even when it was alive. Everything is one moment! The world is based on results! The gossip of people!

188,2016-4-3,2016,4,3,21,4d5y4p,What is your favorite underrated singer/group and why do you think people should listen to them?,ThatRaggedyMan,1459685668,"So Wa$$up debuted at a time when twerking was really frowned upon in Kpop culture, and their music video was pretty much the equivalent of a 90's hip hop music video in the U.S.

Since then though, Kpop has gotten a lot sexier, and Wa$$up has put out some pretty good songs. Based on Youtube views, [Nom Nom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvpdSyZcAo) is their most popular song, but I really like [Stupid Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Hqv2x3WVw) and [Shut Up U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfQRC4xZuBA). The latter is my favorite song of theirs and the former has a pretty spicy video. They're really growing as a pop/hip hop girl group and I think people who initially hated on them just because they did a little twerking should go back and give them a second shot.

Spica is also a group that I think should get more love. After getting Lee Hyori to produce their song [You Don't Love Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc1RwpRfbT0), Spica management unfortunately went the wrong way and tried to jump on the Western migration band wagon. With companies like JYP Entertainment and S.M. Entertainment trying to move into the American market, Spica management tried following suit and as a result, Spica failed to properly capitalize on their sudden rise in popularity. Their English single, [I Did It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Mns7IbRFE) is actually a great song in its own right, but it fell in an awkward middle ground where it wasn't marketed properly for its domestic Korean market, and we all know that Asian groups ultimately failed to become mainstream in the West. I think they do best with up beat sassy/spunky songs and I hope they can return to that kind of sound.",10,0

**Overview**
As a long time Crucial Star fan I am fully satisfied with this album. It gives off a similar vibe to his previous full-length, *Midnight*, while still maintaining it's identity as a full album. The production is incredibly jazz inspired, with that subtle Crucial Star style hidden in the backbeat. He interlaced a few spoken word excerpts into the songs, most notably one by Robin Williams from *Dead Poet's Society*. I would recommend it to anyone who like khiphop and anyone looking to get into the genre. Overall it's a very relaxed album and a satisfying listen that will stay in my rotation for a good long while.

**Favorite Tracks**

* Can't Take My Eyes Off You: Such a smooth track, with some sly references to past songs; definitely not one to ignore. Solid flow over the piano chord progression and a great song to relax and enjoy.

* Four Seasons Vacation: The guitars, the hi hats, the claps in the background. Crucial Star flows perfectly over a beat made to bob to. This one is going to be played in the car a lot.

* Seize The Day: One of the highlights of the album for sure. I absolutely love the Robin Williams excerpt, and the strings give me chills. Classic Crucial Star.

* Adoptee: I absolutely love the piano chord progression in this song. I'm a sucker for anything piano or string instrument, and this doesn't disappoint.

*Note: I did not create the playlist the songs came from, I simply linked them. All credit for uploading the songs goes to the original uploader.*",1,11

So far there isn't solid news yet of a new JYP girl group. So is JYP gonna give somi solo schedules just to milk her popularity? What about, ahem, adding Somi to Twice? I honestly think that would be a good business decision (but obviously for Twice's next album cycle)",42,8

I've been trying to get some of my family into kpop, and I've had little to no success. Only person that I've successfully gotten into kpop is my cousin. I started by introducing her to some of the bigger groups like SNSD, Big Bang, 2NE1, and such, and she said that she liked most of their music. I then introduced her to the newer groups like GOT7, Red Velvet, SEVENTEEN, GFriend, and others. She ended up really liking the newer groups, and she's become a huge fan of SEVENTEEN (DK's her bias) to the point where she watches their One Fine Day and variety show appearances. I've been trying to get my other family members into kpop but haven't had any luck yet. 

How about you, Reddit? Have you had any luck convincing your family, friends, colleagues or others to get into kpop? What was your experience? ",219,56

I decided to investigate the next related video, which was ['Crazy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY&amp;nohtml5=False), also by 4minute.

I'll be trying to keep up with this like I do with King of the Masked Singer.

**Show Format:**

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated.

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The 2nd round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

There are 200 votes up for grabs in the judging of Round 2.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

Jung Yonghwa said, We saw the video when DAY6 first came out.  They had a concept and seemed to do well.  We hope that there would be more bands like DAY6.  There has to be a lot of major bands for the attention on bands to expand.  

Lee Jonghyun said, We hope that therell be a lot of friends with whom we can hang out with while playing instruments together after meeting in the broadcasting companys waiting room.  Im bored in the waiting room, causing laughter.  

Can CNBLUE and DAY6 play together in the waiting room then?!  Theyre both promoting right now, so fans would love this.

Either because you think that track would have done better, been more well-received etc. or even because you think the MV and the live performances of that track would've been much more interesting/engaging!

For example, Rainbow recently came back with their title track ""Whoo"", but after listening to the whole EP I felt ""Black &amp; White"" was a much stronger song and could've easily been their promoted track instead (though I can't say for sure if it would have actually done any better sales-wise). 

I'm sure everyone has their own examples of this, so what are yours?",61,8

&gt; Boys Republic's Minsu revealed on the April 7 airing of 'Cultwo' that he suffered quite a substantial injury to his head. 

&gt; The idol explained, ""I struck my head on the ceiling of the practice room."" 

&gt; Minsu said, ""The ceiling has always been low. I had to get around eight stiches. I'm basically hammering metal (wire sutures) onto my head."" The other members added, ""The [stitches] are held in place by staples.""

Idk

Edit: Bad example I know sorry. I'm getting hate for no apparent reason though. Yes I understand it seems I'm only targeting uncle fans I should have worded it differently. But what I'm trying to say is its ok to be an older fan be it a noona or uncle fan, music has no age limit. It's just weird, for me atleast, when some of them seem a bit obsessive like it's cool to say they're cute but when people say they're sexy and what not and over sexualize young idols is a bit cringey. 

Edit 2: let me reiterate my thought cause I suck at explaining things. Point blank,  fans no matter the age that are obsessive and stalk their bias group or favorite idols are cringey. Por favor entiende qu yo quiero decir. Sorry if I offended older fans but that wasn't my intention...*sigh*",75,0

Before: http://imgur.com/Gi9enQ7

After: http://imgur.com/Z3OtBlK

Other un solicited rumor feeding info, in the latest MBK V app including I.O.I member Chaeyeon and eliminated Produce 101  trainees Dani and Kathy, Neither Kathy or Chaeyeon mentioned DIA once even after multiple comments asking about DIA they avoided all comments and even saying follow the 3 of them on their new journey as they train? 

Not weird for Dani to say that right...but Kathy shouldnt be referring to herself as a trainee if shes back in DIA

-----------------------------

This week's theme is Romantic Ballads / Slow Love Songs. This is pretty self explanatory; nominate your favourite slow love songs by your favourite kpop artists. From OSTs to many B sides, list those strong, vocal, emotional songs that you would use to serenade your loved ones.

I could save a ton of money and just get a mediocre seat to just enjoy the concert, or I could dish out the big bucks to go to a hi-touch event or fan photo event (but with 9 other random people I don't know in the photo).

I've heard that hi-touch event aren't worth it, because they are so fast and whatnot. The venue only holds about 4,500 people to begin with and only a small portion of those tickets include the hi-touch or photo, but I have no idea what to expect. I just wanted to hear from those who have gone to these types of events (especially if it was a GOT7 event) to see what they are like and if it's worth it for me to spend the money ($200+) on it...plus it's always good to hear about fan experiences.

**The idol was Afterschool's Lizzy.**

Evidence shown on the show:

- Left Running Man and did not become a success unlike Song Joong Ki

- She was laying in bed even though it was late in the afternoon

We'll be doing polls and challenges to determine which girls will be ""safe"" for voting periods (via randomized groups) but obviously to play fairly we'll need a few more active voters/discussion --- since it doesn't entirely pertain to p101 i figured i'd post it in here as a cross reddit kinda thing [since it pertains to kpop and voting/discussion in general?] and would be a fun kind of thing to do where people could vote for their favorites and see what kind of final 11 we could create out of our biases.

The criteria for participants right now [we have 86 girls selected and are trying to find info on more nugu groups to fill it up to 101 but if we can't we're going to expand critera] is that they must be in a girl group that debuted in 2009-2012, and have been born after 1990 to prevent entire girl group rosters from going in to prevent cluster voting/ all of one group being in the final line up (it did nothing to prevent that with AoA and Apink tho)

Come over and participate if you want, it's a neat idea and would be fun to have a few people passionate about girl groups and p101 participate!",5,0

At this point those who wrote in questions probably had already forgotten all about this post I made about 3 months ago asking people to submit questions for me to ask Cheska in a quasi-interview:

[If you're not familiar with Cheska, the ""Fiestar's A-HA!"" (featuring Jei, Caolu, and Cheska) series is pure gold](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5rj4lZ_rrMv5sZgorCfn8AHjoblLGzjE)

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, she came through and here are the answers for those who are still curious.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
/u/yamawizard asked:
&gt; ""How do you feel that your former group mates are now finally being recognized? (ie. crazy dog and cao lu)""?

*  They deserve the love. They worked hard for it and I'm happy if they are happy haha.  

&amp;nbsp;

/u/Taengoosundies asked:
&gt; ""I'd love to know if her leaving Fiestar had anything to do with their somewhat radical change of concept. One More was one of the most sexual MVs of all 2014, and it was quite a departure from their much more innocent, ""cutesy"" image of their previous songs. I honestly couldn't even picture Cheska in that MV. I'd also just like to know if she is happy being away from the craziness that is the life of a Kpop performer. And if she knows how much we miss her.""

* No it did not have anything to do with the concept. I left because the idol group thing was just not my type of thing. :) I am happy right now yes. I wasn't happy before though due to the fact that it just wasn't easy for me. Good experience though. And yes I guess? Theres fans out there who miss me but I miss them as much as they miss me. Which is why I'm working so hard on my music before I get it released. :)

&amp;nbsp;

/u/T-rollypoly asked:
&gt; ""Hey OP please ask Cheska this: What is the real reason why you left Fiestar? How is your current relationship with the other Fiestar members? and when will we get a Geeks x Cheska x Kasper collaboration? Thanks!""

* Again, I left because it wasn't what I thought it would be like. I left to make music. And to live life a bit freely. Also I like being honest haha for instance aegyo was never in my blood. I had to practice and learn. No we don't contact each other because I'm sure they're very busy. And I'm not sure about the collabs, maybe? Maybe not?? I honestly don't know hahaha.

&amp;nbsp;

/u/daaashu asked:
&gt; ""Does LOEN have an official stance on body mods? I've been curious ever since I realized that Cheska has a nose piercing, Linzy has her belly piercing, and between History and Fiestar, there's at last one tattoo going on.""

* Haha well on Sea of Moonlight I had to take out my nose ring. I didn't want to but i guess it was better for the sweet image. After that I just wanted to keep it in so they let me. I had my nose pierced since 9th grade if anyone wanted to know. Haha

&amp;nbsp;

/u/catsnailslipstick asked:
&gt; ""Have you seen Yezi on UPRS? What do you think?""

* Yes I did haha it was fun watching it but sadly I only got to watch like 5 episodes. I'm not a tv person lol I'm a computer geek. Game geek to be exact.

&amp;nbsp;

/u/Iggins01 /u/nighoblivion asked:
&gt; ""1 Psy sized psyduck, or 100 psyduck sized Psys?""

* 1 psy sized psyduck plz. Cutest duck evvveeerr.

&amp;nbsp;

/u/Teitoku asked:
&gt; ""Can you tell us what projects you are currently working on and when we could possibly expect new music? Panorama is a fucking jam, and I need more! p.s. Will you marry me?""

*  tbh I don't really know haha I'm just making tons of music and I'm going to pick a few out and release an album maybe?? Or maybe I might release a few singles? Idk.. haha but I'm planning on releasing it before 2016 ends. P.s. when, where, what time? Hahaha

&amp;nbsp;

/u/Ski_Ski asked:
&gt; ""I have a Few Questions  1) what are some of your favorite kpop groups and singers, mine is Zion T :D  2) Is the training and treatment of idols and trainees really as bad as they say they are ? ( In terms of physical/verbal abuse on members from managers, also the long and painful hours)  3) How hard do you think it is for non kpop idols to enter the korean music market? people such as Zion T EDIT: Is my offer for marriage too much to ask hahahaha""

* Hmmm... Jay Park, Lilboi, Rimi, Takeone idk can't think atm... And the rest is a secret. Sorry. Forgive me!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

/u/morningbaby asked:
&gt; ""ARE YOU STILL A ZELO NOONA FAN?! As someone who is experiencing noona fan status for the first time with Seventeen, I am legitimately curious because I feel the stigma! I feel the stigma so hard now!! Do you listen to any kpop at all now or no? Anybody new you like? If these are dumb questions, then also: You and Lil Boi started dating one year after he debuted/when you debuted. When did you guys let your companies know and how did they support/not support/ignore the relationship? What was your thought process when you decided to leave Fiestar and how difficult was it to go, both emotionally and legally?""

* tbh.. it was the only name I knew from a boy idol group...  sry but believe it or not, it was all acting. :(  I let the company know like a year before I left because I felt like I needed to let them know. Before I told my company that we were dating, The only people who knew were the boss and assistant boss of lilboi's company and of course our friends. I was shocked that it came up on the news... I'm actually glad though because I have nothing to hide now. The only thing left is to release my music!! Yay!""

&amp;nbsp;

/u/Shawtaay asked:
&gt; ""While in the industry what was your highest high and lowest low that you're willing and comfortable sharing with us? I know many fans understand a lot of the difficulties of being an idol, but I wonder if there was anything maybe we don't realize or think about that happens.""

*  Again.. I'm not really allowed to say anything about the process. Sorry shawtaay.

&amp;nbsp;

/u/Chiniro asked:
&gt; ""If you were a fruit, which would you be and why?""

* This is the hardest question on here.. idk.. hmm.. mango!!!! Cuz it friggin tastes good :)

&amp;nbsp;

These questions I ended up asking her out of my own curiousity:
&gt; ""When you randomly bump into a fan on the street, how would you prefer that they behave? (Come talk to you? Take a photo with you? Just wave and move on? Leave you the heck alone? Haha.)""

* idk I never bumped into one :) maybe sip a coffee together and chit chat?? Lol sounds fun.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; How do you honestly feel about fancams (have you ever watched any fancams of Fiestar)?

* Yes I did watch a few. Idk how to answer this question. At the time it helped me catch my bad habits on the stage. So it was very helpful etc. Lose weight hahaha I gained so much weight from stress during my girl group days but I'm glad I'm back to my normal body now. Stress free is awesome.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I know you play(ed) Heroes of the Storm, but how much time do you actually get to play games? What are some of your favorite games? And what are some other things you like to do on your spare time?

*  I don't play heroes of the storm now. :( I play just whenever I'm stressed. Game=medicine.  I actually play a loooot like too much haha it's either work or games. My fav at the moment is league of legends and stardew valley. I like reading different types of books on my Paperwhite and playing with makeup. I also like swimming and sleeping. I need at least 12 hours of sleep to function haha

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Last question! What were the best and worst parts about being a KPOP idol? Please start with the worst as I always like to end things on a positive note haha.

* Worst is that I couldn't be me, if you know what I mean. Lol and best is, it was a good experience.

A year passed and it was a landslide victory for gfriend which came from a relatively unknown company and had no predebut exposure unlike lovelyz (jiae and infinite concerts). I can even say that gfriend is the true sister group of infinite with their slick choreography and stable voices while performing the choreography. I'm not gfriend biased. I like both girl groups. I watch their variety show appearances but I tend to be more entertained when gfriend makes an appearance. I don't know if lovelyz just has too much members to keep track or some of them just have zero personality. Any thoughts guys?,18,2

I am happy to announce Mamamoo as our most voted artist for Week 4 of [K-Spotlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/4bdgfr/discussion_kspotlight_introduction/)! Before we start, lets go over some Mamamoo basics:

________________________________________________________________

**Name**: [Mamamoo/ ](http://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/29230333/MAMAMOO5.jpg)

**Pronunciation**: Mah Mah Moo [mmmu] 

**Disambiguation**: [Mamamoo] = similar to the sound of a babys cry. **x** [Mama] = used around the world for a maternal figure that naturally attracts others  for guidance and resources, such as music.

**Label**: Rainbow Bridge Entertainment

**Members**: [Kim Yongsun (Solar)](https://33.media.tumblr.com/06f0162617c9c6d4aaedd01b704b4590/tumblr_inline_o4pqfyoAKM1u2wsfw_500.gif), [Moon Byul Yi (Moonbyul)](http://pa1.narvii.com/5806/358091a4a6d05c11e1f76eae0ae2dae6a1d68228_hq.gif), [Jung Wheein](https://33.media.tumblr.com/1546d1a993718aaeab93ecf29e8377fa/tumblr_nv1mm76Xzb1tpux0go2_540.gif), [Ahn Hyejin (Hwasa)](http://i.imgur.com/d0cia8g.gif)

**Debut**: June 19, 2014 - [Mr. Ambiguous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D15-XYRubsc)

**Fandom**: MooMoo/

**Disambiguation**: A play on part of Mamamoos name. Further shows the groups affinity for radishes, and by extension, their fans. Another meaning is becoming a listener of Mamamoos music.

**Official Colour**: [According to research and my own limited knowledge, Mamamoo do not have an official colour, opting to have an official vegetable instead  the mu, which is Korean for radish.]( http://33.media.tumblr.com/df9b2d1dc3669c2fd4b13971da3d1896/tumblr_inline_nsw6v7G2cz1rtzklq_500.gif)

 I'm mean I'm turning 25 y/o this year and I really like UP10TION (both songs and members), so my friend think I have some kind of shota complex towards some members. It's hard to explain her that I appreciate UP10TION members as cute dorks jumping and screaming all around, it can be compared as a Mom loving her children.

She constantly tells me to stan group with members of my age, but I disagree because I think she misses some amazing talented idols, because no matter the age, talent is talent.

EDIT: I forgot to mention but I don't sexualize those young idols. NEVER EVER.",50,0

This was a early morning sport station in LA, but Devil was being played as an intro to a segment on the show. I just sat there stunned as that's the last place I would expect to hear kpop. I tried to search up the station later, but I couldn't find it. On another note, Chinese bakeries and boutiques in my area play kpop all the time, I remember jamming out to Miss A Only You and RV Dumb Dumb.

           3rd Tweet: You cant ignore discrimination, you need to fix it. 
                          



Eight months ago she had written the following on an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/5kIK2UN-nl/?taken-by=ajol_llama):
           
          I never want to be forceful but there comes a time where i need to put my foot down on 
          something i strongly believe in. Due to recent events i want to address something:
          I've been a tomboy pretty much all my life and honestly, to put it short, 
          it really sucks sometimes. Haters can and will hate, but insulting me in front my 
          face is totally different thing I personally believe girls and boys are not 
          limited to one specific look. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.
          We are all different. If we all sang the same melody how can there be harmony? 
          Dont judge someone just because they're different. Hopefully we can all grow
          to respect each other's differences. Im always trying to stay positive and happy. I love 
          my work, and the people who are constantly supporting me. I am always thankful 
          because i know i cant be here on my own strength. With every mistake, i analyze my 
          fault and then try to better myself. I know i can't be perfect but i will always try
          to be my best. In regards to that, i want thank everyone again for constantly 
          encouraging me and believing in me. To put it simply, love and help one another.
          And for people who are struggling, always be yourself. Being true and real 
          to who you are is the biggest thing you can do for yourself. Love life, work hard,  
          and chase your dreams. Thank you again.

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

For those who doesn't know about it, it's an app that help you memorize rookie kpop groups' members, and also compete against other kpoppers in how fast you can recognize your favorite kpop groups.
It's both a learning device, and a game.
It has 118 kpop groups, and I'm almost sure I didn't miss anything.

It's available on Android's play store under the name [KpopFaces](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kpopfaces.kpopfaces), or via the website [here](http://kpopfaces.com) (PC and Mobile friendly).

And of course, feel free to give another feedbacks!",10,26

I know thete kinda the stigma where people say some idols aren't even rappers eg. Chanyeol from Exo. Like, how do you even know lol. I know there's a few idol rappers that are really good though like Zico. But I've been wondering is S. Coups and Vernon are really rappers. They sound legit to me. Who do you think are legit rappers in idol world and who aren't? Cuz some songs are a bit cringy when the rappers rap.",36,1

1843,2016-4-23,2016,4,23,19,4g2x4v,[Rumor] April 2016 Blind Items,tempkpapaccount,1461405801,"* Popular girlgroup member Ms. A recently declared to her company, ""I won't sing anymore."" After doing acting and variety for quite a while, she now thinking that she's no longer an idol singer but actress. ""I am not idol singer anymore but an actress. To protect the pride of an actress, I am not going to sing again,"" she emphasized. That's why her fellow group members now is in mental breakdown situation over Ms. A's announcement.
 
* The company screwed me! There is no end to girlgroup member Ms. B's complains. Ms. B has wealth and honor as a member of girlgroup. Recently she blamed the company because there's no clear/definite schedules for her. To her company, ""Even if I don't promote with this girl group, I'm a person who can be in Hollywood right now. I sacrificed many things for this group, but what the hell with this situation?"" Ms. B expressed her frustration. One insider who heard this issue commented, ""I can't understand how many times I think about it. The fact that she's a member of this girlgroup will bring her a lot of virtues so I feel her decision is quite a pity. This group seems going to loose one member from Ms. B withdrawal."" (withdrawal referring to ANOTHER withdrawal)
 
* Recently company C suddenly receives praise from fans, ""they finally working."" Company C hold events and provides various platforms of contents to support their singer since in the past it's something that can't be seen thus fans were the one who had to work to support the singer instead. However, for your information, up till now Company C had never given effort to their marketing/promotion department yet for the first time entrusts vicarious execution to promote their artist. Insider who knows this commented, ""This company receives praise that they actually have skills in business field too.""
 
* Rookie singer D who released a debut album last year and promoted on many broadcasts no longer can't be seen making comeback this year. D's company doesnt have plan to release D's new album nor appoint D's broadcast schedules. The reason is after D has debut, suddenly D got caught for celebrity disease. D begins acting so highly and might, neglecting practice session, and showing arrogance expression on broadcast. The company CEO called D out screaming at D so there was quite an uproar at that time. Afterwards, D's father came up from countryside then flipped the agency out. D still have 5~6 years of contract remaining but the company declares that even though they begin lose out money, if D won't change attitude, they won't make a comeback for D.
 
* X broadcast station was going to shoot for their drama miniseries but 4 leads dropping off at the same time. A recent hottest idol Ms. E received an offer for a role and she likes the character. Ms. E asks if her screen time can be increased, she will accept the drama even though only for supporting role. The scriptwriter later re-touched the script to increase her screen time but suddenly Ms. E demanding to be the lead female. Hoping to teach Ms. E a lesson, the scriptwriter released a news saying that the female lead character and Ms. E's image doesnt fit so the discussion didnt come out well.

**pt 2**


* Popular beauty star C, who is rude to her manager, company, and staff, is known to be a kind star to her neighbors. C lives in a luxury apartment of high-class people. When she runs into someone in the elevator, she approaches them and greets them politely. Even in sauna where she's naked, she's nice to her neighbors. An insider shakes head at her two-faced personality, ""C treats her manager, stylist, and staff like slaves but she's taking care of her image in her apartment since it's full of high-class people.""

* A lot of times, actors work together for a project for a long time and fall in love. After seeing each other for a long time, it's natural that they eventually start a relationship. But some actors get criticized because they look more like they're there to date rather than to act. Actor D is also infamous to be hitting on every actress he works with. A lot of companies warn their actresses when they work with D.

* A lot of celebrities are known to be heavy drinkers. Celebrity E is one of them. When drinkers talk about their drinking limits, they usually mentions bottles of soju or beer they can drink maximum. But E drinks too much so he mentions the time he drinks instead. Depending on his conditions, his limit changes. It's usually 12 hours and he even drank up to 1 night and 2 days straight without sleeping, shocking people around him.

So I've been noticing one of the things with K-Pop idols is their hairstyles. Zico's got that acorn mullet...thing going on atm for Toy promos and GD's rat tails at the 2015 MAMA(?) awards.

Were you able to explore NY on the days you were there? How long is the trip from Newark to Manhattan? 

I really just want to know is it worth it for me to go. I've been to Kcon LA and I mainly go for the concert. I don't really care for the fan engagement or high touch and would prefer exploring around the city and eating good food. Kcon is too unorganized for me to bother waiting in line to see the artist during the convention. I also find the convention quite boring. Let me know your experience. ",18,8

1894,2016-4-24,2016,4,24,14,4g7231,Bap concert experience (with bravebros),PolymerKlaypop1477,1461477139,"It was a very heartfelt concert they put all their energy into it. The members were insane on stage they took 2 very small talking breaks and got changed so quick in between the movie parts it was shocking . They played be happy twice once towards the middle and once as the last song. But the highlight for me was towards the end of the show each member said something to the crowd in korean this time and they brought out a translator BUT anytime any member said anything they made the signature brave brothers/aoa airhorn noise with their mouths then later on the actual concert band or wherever the hell that noise comes from started making the noise for them (who knows some say brave brothers was actually there that night behind the stage making the air horn noise himself) then in the middle of all the members saying 'I love u babys' 'I love chicago' ' I loved performing' Daehyun shouts WAIT runs behind stage then runs out 30 secs later holding a piece of pizza and screaming I love chicago Pizza all the members laughed so hard and the crowd was hysterical. They sang every song I hoped they would which is a rare thing for me. overall it was a great concert reunion as I went to the last one. they said that because they were very happy with their situation now we should also be happy and not worry anymore i guess they know how much fans hate ts. only bad part was that himchans part got skipped in hurricane, :( No Loof was on fire that night
  
I hope there is a fancam of that airhorning cause it was hillarious",8,31

-----------------------------

This week's theme is Boy Groups. Nominate your favourite boy idol group songs. Try to limit yourself on solo artists that are in a boy idol group, unless they are a very iconic and noteworthy solo artist!

Feel free to ask questions to me or the nominators to see perceptions on nominated songs.


------------

##**Here are the rules**:

* Please post each song nomination separately (one per comment).

* There is no limit to the number of songs you can nominate.

* Each song must come with a YouTube link (use official channels if possible).

* The top 50% of the songs will make the playlist.

* **PLEASE CHECK** if the song you're going to post hasn't been already nominated (Ctrl+F).

* Upvote the songs you would like to have in the playlist.

* Nominations and voting will end **7 days** after this post **roughly this time next week**. At this point I will take the qualified songs, make a YouTube playlist and begin the next week.

------------------

These are the possible upcoming themes:

* Electro / Futuristic Kpop &lt;-- May remove

* Remixes

* Girl Groups

A final playlist week is coming up soon!

The balcony seats are affordable and still have a good view because it's a relatively small theater and is sloped for a better view!  
  
This is the first fanmeet held in USA for any SM artist ever (outside of SMTown related events), and SHINee's first solo event of any kind here as well. It is very likely that the success (or lack thereof) of this event will be used to determine whether or not SHINee and other SM artists will come here for solo events and concerts in the future. If we want there to be any chance for SHINee's world tour to stop in USA, and a better chance for SM artists like f(x) and Red Velvet to have events here, we need to do everything we can to make sure this fanmeet sells out and goes well!!!  
There have been a lot of people saying they won't go if they can't get close seats. Please please please do not let that deter you. Surely being in the same room as SHINee with 4000+ other shawols showing love and support for their first solo US event will be an incredible experience, no matter where you are sitting!! Please spread the word, bring your friends, and support SHINee!",144,134

I know this doesn't really mean much as far as the amount of singing they get to do, but it's interesting to see who holds the title in each group, especially groups with strong vocal lines.

There are some groups with one clear main vocalist, like f(x). Luna is far and beyond the best vocalist in the group and as such is the main vocalist. While Amber and Krystal are decent singers, they would never be a main vocalist  even if they were in other groups.

However, there are some groups with very strong vocal lines, where I could see any of the lead vocalists being main vocalists. For instance, GOT7. Youngjae is considered the main vocalist and Junior and JB are considered leads, but I think both JB and Junior are strong enough vocalists where they would likely be main vocalists had they been in other groups. 

Like I said, I know it's just a title, but these are the random things I think about so I thought I'd hear other people's thoughts.

1990,2016-4-25,2016,4,25,13,4gbsmw,Gyurang appears to have left Girls Girls (),COTAnerd,1461559337,"Rookie girl group Girls Girls has been comprised of Miso, Aryeong, Vori, Rina and Gyurang since their debut in December 2015.

On the 17th April, they uploaded a performance onto Facebook of them [performing at Migliore](https://www.facebook.com/GIRLSGIRLSOFFICIALPAGE/videos/1316234955059793/) where Gyurang was absent. Although this alone is not necessarily indicative of Gyurang leaving, the Facebook post was tagged with each member's name - except Gyurang. Previously, most Facebook posts on the Girls Girls page have tagged each member's name.

This was also not an isolated incident. On the 24th of April they uploaded a similarly tagged [performance](https://www.facebook.com/GIRLSGIRLSOFFICIALPAGE/videos/1321044981245457/) to Facebook. Gyurang, again missing.

Gyurang hasn't been seen participating in performances or social media for the last two weeks.

Although Gyurang's profile still appears on HBrother's Entertainment [page](http://hbro-ent.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=artist) and appears on their [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx89yX7v37cQ7fchXjqt_mQ/videos), the Girls Girls [Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/GIRLSGIRLSOFFICIALPAGE/timeline) has been updated on the 25th of April with a new cover photo that shows only [Miso, Aryeong, Vori and Rina.](https://www.facebook.com/GIRLSGIRLSOFFICIALPAGE/photos/a.1205999346083355.1073741827.1205996189417004/1321280327888589/?type=3&amp;theater) Gyurang's Instragram is also missing from the [Girls Girls official Instragram Following list.](https://www.instagram.com/girlsgirls_official/following/)

There is yet to be an official confirmation, but her departure is highly speculated by fans.

I figured I'd upload all the links I can find here in case someone wanted to watch them. These performances, all of them, not just Taeyang, are seriously amazing, I highly highly recommend watching the full eps of the show because the Naver clips are usually shortened, and it's pretty hard to find videos on Youtube, usually only audio is available. Ill update with any extra links I can find later on.

Is there one common outfitter company that rents out these clothes much like music video props? Or did they happen to buy the same thing? I always thought that the idols either bought and chose their own clothes or more frequently their company and stylists decided for them

**Show Format:**

Contestants first try to win over the audience judges, by singing a song without their visual being revealed. If the audience vote total reaches 100, their visual is revealed. If they fail to reach 100, they are eliminated.

Once they are revealed, they have the remaining length of their song to try and get 3 Panel votes. If they reach 3 votes, they advance to the next round. Otherwise, they are eliminated.

The next round is where the contestant chooses the Legendary Singer they want to compete against. Then they are presented with 4 song choices, and the contestant will pick one that they want the Legendary Singer to sing. 

The legendary singers have 3 hours to prepare their song.

For each win for the contestant, they will receive a set amount of prize money.

- 1 Win = 2 Million Won ($1,750 USD)
- 2 Wins = 5 Million Won ($4,376 USD)
- 3 Wins = 10 Million Won ($8,752 USD)
- 4 Wins = 20 Million Won ($17,505 USD)
- 5 Wins = 100 Million Won ($87,527 USD)

I bought too many tickets for the fanmeet, and would love if this extra seat wasn't empty! I'm completely comfortable with a Ticketmaster transfer and no compensation, I just want to give this ticket to somebody who would use it. 
It's a single seat, sorry about that, but hopefully somebody would appreciate it. I can transfer the ticket up to May 6 at 7pm, after that (I believe) it is untransferable. The ticket will be given away on a first come first serve basis. 
Anyone interested needs a valid Ticketmaster account!

Some are face value or lower, or higher depends if they got resold to them. Check it out if you're interested!! [Google docs ](https://docs.google.com/document/d1FYXoRLz5GDkNr2y-rrldgikRd6H9S5_YcNfY-JuAcs0/mobilebasic?pli=1)

Please also keep in mind that the event isn't sold out yet either, there's still lots of tickets left on the ticketmaster website! Lowest price is $55. 
Some people are also giving away their tickets for free, so if you're in a tight financial situation I hope you'll get one! 
Here are some other helpful things to do:
Search #SHINEEinChicago on Twitter to find people selling or looking for tickets. As well as #shinee fanmeet

And here is a Facebook group dedicated to the tickets whether it's selling or exchanging etc. [fb page ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ShineeTicketSalesAndExchanges/)(**Note: you can still exchange your ticket if you call ticket master for the same value ticket or higher if available, and the great thing is your ticket would go back up on the site)

Hope to see and meet shawols! :-)

The fanclub updated today with information of the members that will be in the Guess Who tour (everyone sans Hyunseung) and following that there was an announcement that the fanclub will be closing in September of 2016, it seems.

My kanji is super sketchy so with the help of Google Translate it does seem refunds for renewals that would happen after the closure will be refunded for the amount of time remaining.

That being said, this is a bit disconcerting:

""201610BEASTCUBE ENTERTAINMENT

2011BEAST""

Or, in (currently until I find a suitable translation) Google Translate terms:

"" Regarding Japan activities of the BEAST of 2016 since October, it will be announced as soon as from CUBE ENTERTAINMENT determined. Start the fan club management in 2011, so far with you are extremely grateful that we look forward your support than a lot of people, I would like to continue to ask for the continued abiding your support to the BEAST.""

I'm not sure how I feel about this. It doesn't give me a very good feeling, but then again I'm pretty biased since I just joined the fanclub here in December.

(I hope this is acceptable, it's my first reddit post and I looked over the rules so I hope it's okay. :( Since Beast is primarily Kpop I thought it belonged here!)",11,42

The Venue

It was at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center. You can tell that this theatre is mostly set up for doing theatre performances and what not. Overall, everything was very well organized. There was no pit or standing area and the tickets all had assigned seats so there was no pushing/shoving/fighting etc. related to that. We got there about 3 hours early, but honestly we could have gotten there 15 minutes before showtime and been absolutely fine. They allowed us to go in the building at about 6:30 and there were a lot of attendants there to help direct us to our seats. The doors to the actual performance hall did not open until 7:00. My seats were on the second level, dead center. Seating charts can be deceiving and make tickets look worse than they actually are. Since the facility is built UPWARD, we were actually probably only about one hundred feet or so away from the stage, just on the second level. Getting in and getting to our seats was very uneventful lol

The Performance
The entire performance had such high energy the ENTIRE time. If I recall correctly, the only ballad they performed was  With You. This is the set list that I can remember. Ill add more if I remember more:

Warrior, No Mercy, Feel So Good, Be Happy, What The Hell, Bang x2, 1004 Angel, One Shot, Badman, Kingdom, Young, Wild, and Free, With You

There were three solo stages: Himchan performed SNS, Zelo had a mix of songs including Cant Feel My Face and Pillow Talk (fancam at the end of this post), and Jongup had one but I dont know the name of the song he did but I have inserted a fancam at the bottom of the post if anybody can identify it! 

They didnt speak much. Each member said a couple things in English after their opening set but other than that the concert simply went from song to song to song. 

At the end of the concert, they spoke a little English but then spoke in Korean with the help of a translator. It was your typical It was so great. We loved it here. We had such a good time. Etc etc kind of speech that you would expect. I did think it was really cute how much they loved their translator lol. They were calling for him to come on stage and many of the members were ding skinship with him and grabbing him lol. It was adorable. 

The Encore

Now this to me was the best part. After they sang With You, they said it was their last song of the night and walked off stage. However, the auditorium remained dark and we kept chanting for them to come back, so they did an encore. The song they did for their encore was Young, Wild, and Free. The VCR for it was the intro Himchan did in the music video with artistically placed English subtitles. After that song, they just. Kept. Going. :D

They performed Bang X 2 and No Mercy and also just jumped around to the music mix lol. They were so hype! On multiple occasions, Zelo and Youngjae actually RAN INTO THE CROWD AND DOWN THE ISLES. I was so happy for those fans that got to experience that. I did, however, feel bad for the two managers that had to chase them around while doing so to make sure they were safe lol. But the crowd was really well behaved. The most people did was reach out and touch them. One fan jumped into the isle and started dancing with Youngjae, but she maintained her distance and when he turned around to leave she went back to her seat. From what I saw, nobody had to get escorted out or anything and there wasnt any inappropriate behavior that I saw.

When they were just having fun and performing Bang X2, I was having fun talking to my friends and watching them have fun on stage. Im not kidding I looked down to get my phone and then I looked up-

And Yongguk was shirtless

Her performed No Mercy like that. I have a fancam. It is as wonderful as it sounds. 

Overall it was an amazing show. This is my first fan account and I kind of wanted to keep things strait and to the point. If you have any questions or want me to add anything to the account, please tell me! Im more than happy to answer your questions.

And now the fancams!!

So once in a while if i like a song i look up the lyrics ( eng trans aswell ).So what are some line(s) of a song that really left an impact on you ? A line that made you look diffrent to the song made you think alot or made you feel really sad or happy?

For me 
 
* [G.O.D - Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgXtSx8ublA)

''*i wonder if people all have their chosen way to go or if they make their own ways.* '' even though the whole song has just really great lyrics this line in particular made me have a long ass shower..


* [SG Wannabe - As I live] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwgi-ZA3BDQ)

'' *we'll laugh because we're forced to laugh, we'll live because we're forced to live* '' knowing the story of Chae dong ha and his fight with depression that eventually led him to suicide &amp; The fact that he was also the one that sung this line made. This hits me real deep. 

* [Epik High - Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKiGy2A_nU)

'' *Want a break from the world but the world wanna break you
The weight makes your back bone curl up and make you* '' Epik high really wrote alot of genius lyrics in their songs. This is just one of my favourite. for me its has to do with the fact that with only a few words moved the sentence has a complete different meaning.

The series will take a different perspective from its original video game series to capture each character's progress to become an idol star and friendships beneath vigorous trainings at a Korean entertainment production company. The 15 cast will be chosen through public auditions and voting systems and they'll undergo over 6 hours of vigorous acting and other trainings, and then they will be given main roles of suitable characters of the drama.""

Most notably, Coco and Sori of CocoSori are part of it and so is Halla/Lee Suji of The Ark (RIP). Plus Produce 101's Kim Sohee. Also there are a few North Americans aside from the usual East Asians.

The [FAQ page](http://www.kconusa.com/kcon-info-faq/) is still down for crying out loud. **So if this is the wrong place I apologize but my friend and I are going for the first time and need answers.** I am hoping there are are people on this sub who have been to the con before and help us:

*Will there be one concert or two? (For KCON-LA they always make it two concerts.)

*How does the [ticketing](http://www.kconusa.com/kcon-ny-tickets/) work? I have heard that when you buy combo it's for both days. Then I heard that combo is for the number of people going, not the number of days so I have no freaking clue.

*What is typically included in the goody bag? I want to get a lightstick for the concert but I have heard at past BIG BANG shows they have included a light stick in their goody bags and was wondering if KCON would be the same way.

*What is the difference between the fan engagement (hi touch vs. audience)? I am guessing hi-touch is high fiving the idols but not sure on that or the audience experience.

*Could I take my big DSLR camera and lens for my personal use or does it depend on the venue?

*How does the guarantee and chance experiences work? Especially when buying tickets for multiple people.

*Thanks in advance! :D*
