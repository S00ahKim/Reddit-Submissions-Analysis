This is the follow up and results posting for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5ngkid/hey_wlw_again_rkpop_community_survey_for_lesbians/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) survey I conducted awhile ago in response to another survey.  



I was planning on just updating the post with the results, but I thought maybe I should make a separate thread since we got a lot more responses than I thought I would and it would be a fun discussion opportunity, as well as let others see opinions they might not always see, plus that was almost a month ago!


I'm really sorry if this is considered junky or spammy, if it is just let me know and I'll just add to the original results as I planned and get rid of this. But, these are the results for the WLW survey and r/kpop's unofficial Juicy Lesbian Awards! We reaaaaally didn't need to wait so long but I didn't want to junk up the r/kpop post stream by making a results post in a day.
There were a lot of hiccups with the age answers and getting everything in order, but I'm so thankful everyone had a great time answering this. I love community solidarity and it's really amazing how great this subreddit is. 



We had about *199* WLW respond to this survey! Most of these women identify as *bisexual women* (73 responses) and lesbians (60 responses). 170 respondents have never dated a woman who likes k-pop, but a majority (118 responses) of queer women are friends with other WLW who like k-pop. 


We have a whopping *152 single WLW* on r/kpop, the second top results being women in relationships with men. Most WLW on this sub are more on the femme side of the lesbian Kinsey scale, with only 27 wlw being on the butch side.
With preferences, most of our queer women preferred
 artistic groups (f(X), ladies code) and edgy groups (2ne1, 4minute, black pink). The top boy group with WLW who said they are fans of boy groups is *BTS*!


In favor of keeping this summary short I'm not gonna talk too much about the social issues section, but it was really really interesting to see everyone's opinions and I suggest checking them out for yourself on the summary form. [Here's a link to the survey results in a nice format! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-WEn-8LPYWi5S_wpHcANrpVhGWfSqZqbozwaFGWK7Bc/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-WEn-8LPYWi5S_wpHcANrpVhGWfSqZqbozwaFGWK7Bc/viewanalytics)



&gt; Now onto the fun stuff!

Out of every music performer, idol/rapper/whatever, **Mamamoo's Hwasa** won the most votes for most attractive! Taeyeon was in second places, and Hani and Hyuna tied for third. 


It was a lot easier to count this section considering everyone pretty much voted for the same few people, but the woman you voted with the most ""lesbian appeal"" was **Mamamoo's Moonbyul!** Second and third went to Amber and Krystal from f(X) respectively. 


Following with trends, we voted that **Mamamoo** was the most ""lesbian appealing"" group! They won by a land slide, but f(X) took second place and Red Velvet took third. 


The group with the most genuine fans among the respondents is **Mamamoo**, again! SNSD ended up being in second with f(X) and Red Velvet tying for third!  I love seeing these trends! 


Finally, WLW voted that the best WLW song was the recent **One More Day by Sistar** with an MV depicting a genuine WLW couple. Second place was Touch by Anda, with it's steamy MV and gay ass shit. I'm so happy some respondents said they found new songs through this question! 


Thank you all so much for participating! I'm working on a male version of this survey but I'm going to do a bit more research and wait some time so I don't cloud this sub with queer stuff. Why do you think Mamamoo won so much? Do you think these results aren't truthful to how you viewed k-pop lesbians? *Is to Hwasa attractive gay?* Let's discuss!! ",46,87

Translation:

Hello.

This is SM Entertainment.

We deeply thank all the fans who are interested in the teaser images released today for NCT DREAM's first single album 'THE FIRST' and we would like to explain to the fans who are asking about Jaemin.

Jaemin, who was in Chewing Gum last year, has been getting treatment for a herniated disc since he was a trainee. But it has ~~taken a turn for the worse~~ gotten worse. As an artist, his health is our top priority, so it was decided that he would not participate in these activities in order to rest and focus on treatment.

I had to take a hiatus from moderating for a while due to some personal stuff and I'm afraid that with Town Hall kinda being my pet project noone had chance to take it on. I am semi-back now and so HUZZAH! Here is Town Hall.

 &amp;nbsp;

If you are new here/missed this before, these posts have a few aims: 

 &amp;nbsp;

To provide the mods a place to feedback what discussions have taken place amongst the mod team that may be relevant to the sub and to get feedback on them. 

To get feedback on recent and upcoming changes to the sub. 

To give you guys another way to communicate with the mod team! 

 &amp;nbsp;

If you dont get a response to something raised here right away then please bear with us, it may be that the mods are busy at that time and will get you when they are free or they may have wanted to clarify something with the mod team or another mod.  

**Check out the archive of our Town hall posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/townhall).**

&amp;nbsp;

    Rules

&amp;nbsp;

First up is rules. **This does not mean we are looking to change the rules but we want to make sure how you feel on some rules as the feedback we do recieve is so varied**. This months rule change question is about discussion posts.

&amp;nbsp;

What do you guys think the rules around discussion posts should be? We know from experience that people want such different things from this sub it's impossible (or near to) to please everyone, but, we would like to hear your thoughts. Do you like an element of mod curation as we have now? Would you prefer it stricter? Would you prefer we only removed simple questions (kpophelp) and offensive content?

&amp;nbsp;

    Music show posts

&amp;nbsp;

We love the way the wiki works, but are aware that not all of the shows get posted now. We want these to be a community effort - relying on the mods to do it ends up in a similar situation as when we rely on one user to do them. Plus you guys are super passionate and have every right to be involved in shaping the content in your community. I know some may disagree, but I really think that when it's a group effort we get much better quality content on the sub!

&amp;nbsp;

/u/SirBuckeye has created a fantastic [guide for creating the posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5qvxf3/the_complete_guide_to_creating_and_editing_music/?ref=search_posts) if you want to know more about getting involved. Remember you can also edit one to add links etc too!

(I will add the guide to the wiki as well once this post is up.)

&amp;nbsp;

    Regular posts

&amp;nbsp;

On the subject of regular posts, /u/dessidy is currently considering moving the this week in spotify posts to a wiki format! Dessidy has also metioned potentially making it a 'this week in streaming' post. This would obviously be a really big task so if you think you can help in any way with this, particularly with Apple and Google Music, please let us know here! 

On this note, **do you post a regular thread? Do you think housing it on our wiki (like the music show posts) or as an archive with links to the post would be a good way forward?** Let us know - those regular posts are wonderful sources of content on the sub! If you need help navigating the world of the reddit wiki, just drop us a modmail and I'll help (please be a little patient with me as I can't reply as quickly as I used to!)


&amp;nbsp;

    The real time chart

Just a quick one. We get modmail from time to time regarding incorrect links on the real time chart (thankyou guys for being so good at letting us know). This does happen sometimes unfortunately and we can't manually change them, they should correct themselves after a short time.
&amp;nbsp;


    AOB 

&amp;nbsp;

My only AOB this week is to thank /u/fleur_inoue for volunteering to update the Kpop events wiki in the sidebar!!

&amp;nbsp;

Any other business? What else would you like to ask, feedback or talk to us about? ",53,34

Never did I ever think I would see Shaq kicking a soccer ball on American TV with Girl's Day in the background, hahah. It's even more surprising considering the song is more than 5 years old and wasn't like a mega hit. I thought it was pretty cool, and worth a share!",79,323

This week is a Seollal (Lunar New Year) Special, Ep 37 will continue its second round in Ep. 40.

**This week will work a bit differently, where the contestants get to choose from a pool of singers in the industry, rather than non-celebrities.**


What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

In order of performance:

595,2017-02-08,2017,2,8,7,5sou1e,Would anyone be interested in a weekly kpop game?,G-Dragonite,1486508392,"I apologize if something similar has already been suggested, if this is inappropriate for this subreddit, or if this belongs in another subreddit. I just thought it would be a fun activity everyone can participate in.

My family and I play this game where every day there would be a theme and we all would add songs that we feel fit the theme onto a Spotify playlist. At the end of each day, we would all vote for the song we thought fit the theme best, and then the winner gets to pick the theme for the next day. I thought it would be fun to do something similar on this subreddit. 

What I'm thinking is basically on a certain day of the week (for example, on Monday's) there would be a thread started that specifies a theme. Throughout the week, people would post kpop songs (preferably with YouTube links) that they feel fit the theme and also add what they want the theme for next week to be. They would also vote for a song submitted by another person that they think fits the theme well. At the end of the week (for example, Sunday night), the song with the most upvotes wins and that person's theme will be used for the next week. Some general rules would be that you can only submit one song per user and you can't submit a song someone else has already submitted.

So what do you think r/kpop? Does this sound like something you would be interested in? 

Edit: This idea seems to have gotten a lot of positive feedback which is awesome! Sounds like a lot of you are interested in playing. I'll probably give it more time and then probably do a test run of this on Monday, so if you guys can come up with some ideas for the first theme, I'm open to suggestions :) ",30,146

I think YG did a great job with 2NE1's debut years, and they're doing just as good if not better with Blackpink. My only gripe with Blackpink is for the members to appear on more broadcasts, i.e. Jisoo becoming inkigayo MC. On the other hand, Bigbang's first two years compared to Winner/iKON's first two feels like night and day. There just doesn't seem to be much momentum with iKON, and WINNER is not winning, especially after NTH's schism. I hope both iKON/WINNER thrive in 2017, but YG has to back them fully and realize that his cash cows (Bigbang) are all heading to the military within the next year or two.

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

882,2017-02-11,2017,2,11,21,5te24j,[FAN ACCOUNT] 170211 NCT Dream Show! Music Core Prerec,jolaurence,1486816554,"This is your usual call for snacks, beverage, you name it before you dive in. Also, I included pictures today! 

And so the Children have started their promotions. The last time I saw them was at the Incheon Sky Festival in September and that was when I was super new over here and barely even knew how to navigate the subway system here. I do now.

I left my apartment early Friday so I could get my cd for the show. I rushed out of work Friday at 9:30 pm and did my usual 1 hour commute to the notice, took my picture, and then headed home where my brain kept me up for a while because DREAM KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got my check in number as I started going to bed (it was rather high but at this point I have accepted I will always have a high number until I move to Seoul) and then woke up hours later to go back. This time I took a bus there and it was very relaxing. You have no idea how relaxing taking just one bus at 6:45 am is compared to having to take 3 trains. Anyway, I got there bright and early as always, had breakfast, and actually witness the person in charge of the sign taking it down. 

All of us were waiting outside at our spot when a man from MBC told us that we could go into the building and wait. They were going to be doing check in inside today. Sounds good in theory but wrong. Lots of people in a small space makes it hard to hear sometimes. Eventually, we got all of our lines sorted out and we finished check in. They moved my line towards the back of the building which meant I could no longer watch the Wild-Lightning game that was playing on one of the MBC station tvs. They air the NHL over here. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY I AM ABOUT THIS! 

Check in was supposed to start at 10:30 but it started an hour earlier as usual. The waiting today felt longer than normal. I have no idea why but it did. Eventually we finally were checked for the requirements. They were using the NCT fan card today since all of us had the application for the Dream card. I got my tier (N1 as usual) and waited some more. Finally we got out numbers and I sighed with relief because this was the first time that I knew I would not be cut off. I usually have a higher number and am always on the cusp of being cut off but not today! [The number for prerec was 350 people and I was 326](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4WmY95UoAARb-6.jpg).  That also meant I got a poster. We waited some more until around 12:40 pm when we heard the announcement for N1. The girls around me were all N1 so we went towards the front of the building and got in line. They guided us towards the building and we were set. I followed the line up the stairs and sat in a seat. A SEAT. Im normally sitting on stairs or on the floor. IT WAS THE BACK ROW BUT WHO CARES. IT WAS A SEAT!

The boys came out moments later and we started screaming. They looked so adorable today in their outfits. However, you could tell the jackets were making them feel overheated. The choreography for this song is no joke. Its very energetic so those heavy jackets did not help. Renjun and Chenle were really hot because of the jackets. Mark gave a ment but they were still working on the lights so every member had a chance to talk. 

They had the rehearsal take, two full takes, and then a partial take today. For the rehearsal, they wore the name tags for the camera people so they knew who was who. To get into position, Mark leads the members by having them get in their places, hold hands, and get set. They then go down on the floor in position. ITS WONDERFUL. THEY HOLD HANDS. HOW ADORABLE ARE THE CHILDREN? ADORABLE. And then Jisung is the one who starts it off. Gah. Just so much fun. Chenle by the way is just way too adorable. They left the stage so the director could watch playback and all of us awwd a lot. When they came out, the name tags were gone. Haechan was pretty much being his usual self. He either did a V sign or a thumbs up as he went down to the floor. We also screamed whenever the boys were moving their legs to be straight. Why? Dont ask. Theyre just adorable. 

For the second real take, Jeno was the first one out but no one followed him. The poor lost little puppy. So he waited for others to come and they did. Mark got everyone into position except there was someone missing. As Mark had them get onto the floor, Jeno looked over and said Wheres Chenle? SO MARK SPRUNG UP SO FAST. WHOOPS. NOT READY. Chenle came running out being all Sorry sorry but also so cute that you cant even blame him. Whoops. But also awwwwwwwww. 

They then had to do a partial take for one section and the director showed Mark at what part so Mark then directed the boys into places. MARK LEE IS TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD. They played the music so the boys knew and then did the take. After, they quickly said thank you and left. We all got up and started leaving. Some of us were moaning when they started taking down the set. It was school themed, naturally. We headed towards the MBC building until fan support yelled that we were outside now. Those who were not able to get into the recording were over there waiting for fan cards. Those of us who got in got into lines again and waited to give our applications to the fan support staff. (My fingers started to get cold at this point) [We got our fan cards](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4Yf9j3VMAEyQQv.jpg:large) (and now I have all 3 of them) and then waited to get our posters. [After we got our poster](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4YgCDFVUAE1M73.jpg:large), we were free to go. 

I absolutely love the choreography for ""My First and Last"" ( ). It has the trademark Tony Testa style. There were parts of the choreography that reminded me of SHINee and the choreo they have done with Tony, mainly Sherlock and Everybody. Plus, I was reminded of Catch Me by TVXQ as well. And yes, one part reminded me of Firetruck. There were parts in the choreo that made it clear that the song is designed for seven members. But Jaemins health comes first and we dont want to rush him. Dream is perfect for this song and I mean perfect! I just love everything about it! Their energy is amazing. Hopefully the public catches on with the boys because they are so talented. So, so talented.

Members talk:

**Jisung:** Lets start with the maknae. I get this strong Taemin vibe from him. Like, very very strong. Hes also the youngest and our baby chick. There was something that kinda startled him after a recording and he looked so confused. Hes only going to get better and he is perfect for being the one who starts the song with the choreo. Im so excited to see what he can do next. And hes just gonna keep getting better and better. Taemin, please adopt him for me...I mean us.

**Chenle:** LELE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is honestly a ball of energy that cannot be contained. You cant help but want to love him and protect him and root for him and also aww at him. His smile is so wonderful. And hes just so cute. He also looks up to his hyungs and you can tell that he wants to make them proud. With the little delay thing MuCore does, Chenle was rapping along to Marks part. During the Weibo yesterday he did Taeyons vocal fry. He really looks up to them and all of the members watch out for him and Jisung since they are the babies. MY HEART CANNOT TAKE THIS ADORABLENESS.

**Renjun:** Like damn. He has this stage presence and he just owns it. He still is hesitant to speak in Korean like Chenle but hes trying. And yeah. He does kinda look like EXOs Lay. Im really excited to see how he progresses over the years. Also, he got taller since the last time I saw him in September. STOP GROWING UP KIDS. Plus his voice is so stable like????? How is everyone in this group so talented????????

**Jeno:** *slams fist on table* LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT LEE JENO. Hes destroying hearts left and right and he will destroy yours too. He is gonna be a bias wrecker. I am certain about that. Jeno stans, just brace yourself. Also, vocals. A+ my little darling. 

**Haechan:** Ahhh our adorable 127 maknae who is now not a maknae. HIS VOCALS ARE SO GOOD LIKE OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He just shines with this song and I mean shines! Im glad that Dream lets him show off his vocals because they are just so good and for someone who is at a young age. As he gets older, he will get more lines in 127 but for now, he literally owns the vocals of Dream. 

**Mark:** Oh Mark Lee. Our non-stop little angel from Canada. We see different sides of Mark in each unit. For U, hes the maknae but raps like a champ. For 127, hes the co-rap god with Taeyong again but is maknaes with Haechan. But for Dream we see Mark as a leader, rapper, and oppa. Weve been talking about this on Twitter about how Mark is just very oppa when he is in Dream. During his portions of the song, he shines. There are so many reasons why he is in every unit so far. Plus, he is also doing High School Rapper. Mark is probably the most popular member in all of NCT. He gets new fansites almost every week it feels like. Hes so hardworking, dedicated, and always has a smile on his face even when he is tired. I just have a lot of Mark Lee feelings again.

Overall, Im so excited to see the Dream kids perform again. Out of all of the NCT units so far, Dream has the best dancers. Hands down. I have a feeling that Dream might be the unit who gets the first NCT win and that is going to be an emotional day. ",24,55

Some examples I can think of off the top of my head are too many cuts and weird color saturation. 

For me, it's when the dance doesn't quite match up with the beat of the song. They either speed up the footage or don't bother to actually make sure the dance is on beat. [Doom chit](https://youtu.be/vaijpqksV8Q) drove me crazy with this to where I specifically searched for a [live performance](https://youtu.be/Oh0ADoIRGC8) afterwards to make sure the dance was actually on beat &gt;.&gt;",94,65

Just noticed a trend that for most of idols who don't have Korean blood, is that they eventually return to their own countries to pursue the rest of their career. I never really thought much about this before but I have been noticing Nichkhun starting to prepare to be more active in Thailand. Han Geng also moved back to China to focus on his career there. Even Victoria and Lay, despite still being active in their groups, are devoting a lot of time into their careers in China. 

Come to think of it, they can't expand into acting in Korea as the audience still seems unready for foreigners to become legit actors and not token foreign characters, while the music scene is so competitive especially when their groups are inactive (bigger issue for males as their Korean members will need to serve in the military)

Perhaps the current idol generation with the numerous foreign idols will be telling on how this trend will develop...",36,17

This first week is going to be sort of a test run to see how smoothly this goes.

Because this is the first week, let's start with a simple theme. **Since Valentine's Day is this week, the first theme will be love songs or songs about being in love.**

Submit one Kpop song that you feel fits the theme along with your request for next week's theme (if you wish, you can also give an explanation/reason for your song choice). Also, upvote for other people's submissions that you like best. The person whose submission has the most upvotes by Sunday 11:00pm EST will have their theme chosen for next week. Who will be our first winner?

Submissions should be submitted as comments and should include the artist, song title, YouTube link to the MV or audio if possible, an explanation of your choice if you wish to provide one, your theme request for next week, and a description of your theme if it seems too vague. For example: 

&gt;[BIGBANG - Fantastic Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbokV76tkU)

&gt;I chose this song because...

&gt;Theme Request: Love Songs. Songs that talk about love. 

**Some General Rules:**

1. Songs submitted should be Kpop songs. Songs that aren't in Korean but are by a Kpop group are accepted. Songs from Korean OSTs are also valid. 

2. Only one song submitted per user. 

3. You cannot submit a song that somebody else has already submitted for this week.

4. You can submit songs that have been submitted in previous weeks, however you cannot submit a song that has already won. (This is the first week so you don't need to worry about this one)

5. If your theme request is too vague, please add a description

6. Your theme request cannot be specific to one artist (e.g. ""Songs by [this group]"" is not an acceptable theme). 
 
7. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

EDIT: Sorry for not specifying. Submissions should only be one song (added it to the rules). ",26,25

1066,2017-02-14,2017,2,14,6,5tvk2c,[Discussion] Revision of the 'stale topics' list?,1408_,1487020129,"Some dialogue in another discussion thread yesterday got me thinking about topics on this sub that are ""overly familiar with the user base"" and the topic of  ""what is a suitable time frame for discussion reposts."" Despite all the changes to the sub over the last few months, this issue is still one of my main problems with the sub and once I feel needs to be addressed better. 

This line from the wiki on the topic of ""stale topics"" is what really confuses me 

&gt; Everyone has experienced those type of threads that have been posted over and over again on the subreddit. Honestly, they can be unique at first and will generate discussion. Yet after a period of time, somebody will post the topic again and it gets repetitive. 

On one hand we have the idea that reposts are allowed after a suitable amount of time (whatever that means. this is another one of my questions but whatever) because this time allows for new events/talking points to happen in the kpop world and new users also bringing in new discussion and points of view. Fine. But then on the other hand, apparently ""everyone has experienced those types of threads"" and we have a blacklist of topics deemed ""too stale"" for the subreddit and no longer being allowed to have them as discussions. 

1) where did this list even come from? I dont remember too much about the time it was implemented but was there a vote to see why these specific discussions? Who deemed them too stale?

2) How is this fair on new users who never partook in any of these discussions? I know **some** people might say they can just drudge through the subreddit archives and read through previous discussions but thats not the same as actually being allowed to take part in the discussion yourself. Isnt the whole cant be reposted within x time period meant to prevent exactly this? So why have a whole list this rule doesnt apply to?

3) If there were gonna be a list of topics blacklisted for being too stale - wouldnt that mean the answers they garner are too predictable and well, stale? Here are the list of stale topics:

&gt; What's your unpopular k-pop opinion?
&gt; 
&gt; Questions about songs that don't sound like typical hits
&gt; 
&gt; Questions about something being overrated or underrated
&gt; 
&gt; What is your/the sub's opinion of [INSERT ARTIST HERE]?
&gt; 
&gt; Let's make a list of songs about [INSERT TOPIC HERE]!
&gt; 
&gt; ""What song do you like by an artist that you hate"" and vice versa
&gt; 
&gt; Threads designed to bash an artist or their fanbase
&gt; 
&gt; What's your favorite B-side / non-title track that should have been promoted? (Perhaps allow this discussion twice a year?)
&gt; 
&gt; ""If you could remove any member from this group"" or ""If you could pick any idols to form your own supergroup""
&gt; 
&gt; Who do you want to comeback?
&gt; 
&gt; Questions about group dynamics as to when they should've disbanded or added a new member.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions without initial discussion by submitter

Tbf there are some topics in here where I'm like ""fair enough it makes sense not to allow that"" not because they've been over done, but because theyre low effort and arent really designed for discussion like:

&gt;  Questions without initial discussion by submitter

&gt; Who do you want to comeback?

&gt; Threads designed to bash an artist or their fanbase

etc

But there are other discussions/topics include in there that either, notoriously always gained a lot of interesting/new discussion like the **""unpopular opinion""** threads (regardless of your opinion on this you have to admit it would easily always garner the most and in a lot of cases the most interesting discussions), or banning discussions where in time the influx of new groups, music and users would mean a new range of opinions and discussions. Like  ""*What song do you like by an artist that you hate"" and vice versa, What's your favorite B-side / non-title track that should have been promoted?), Questions about something being overrated or underrated.*

I'm not refuting this entire list as I definitely recognise the overall intention to try and improve discussion on the sub, but its always bothered me that it was introduced because they're topics ""everyone is overly familiar with or are over done"" when that's not the case. 

What's wrong with the 3-6months~ or whatever repost rule? (this really needs to be specified asap. [i thought it was going to after this](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/55n5ds/why_are_so_many_discussion_posts_being_removed/d8cdbkw/)) With the repost rule in place, wouldnt that prevent things from becoming stale or over done? How tired can you get of a discussion being posted if its only done once every x amount of months? Shouldn't the only criteria for a topic being permanently banned be if it itself is a bad discussion, not if its been ""overdone"" or some people are already familiar with it?",34,39

Moderating this type of content is, by far, the most difficult aspect of being an r/kpop mod.  What is allowed and what isn't has not been made very clear, even to the mods.  This creates a lot of frustration for our users as it seems like your posts get removed at random while other similar posts are allowed to stay.  Since the mod team consists of different people, we make different decisions when it comes to group-specific content and that causes inconsistency in mod actions.  With these changes, we hope to eliminate as many mod judgement calls as possible by making a robust and precise list of exactly what types of group-specific content are allowed and what is better suited to the group subreddits.  Here is the **first draft** of the proposed new rule.  Please read it carefully and give your feedback in the comments.

#### B.	Group-Specific Content

1.	Submissions that are only relevant to one group, one idol, or their fans and is **not newsworthy* or substantial** should be posted to the [group-specific subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/relatedsubs#wiki_group.2Fartist_subreddits.3A)  

&gt; &gt;**a.)	Forbidden items:**  Non-newsworthy fluff articles and interviews, performance fancams, non-performance clips from regular v-lives or group shows, short video clips (less than :30) except official teasers, birthday and anniversary posts, discussions aimed at fan members of a specific group, single-member highlights and compilations, fan-made music videos or tributes, fan-made remixes or mashups, fan-made dance covers, reaction videos, single-member social media or YouTube channel openings, group merchandise sales, album sales, ticket sales, group-specific Discord, IRC, or other similar announcements.  

&gt; &gt;**b.)	Permitted items:**  Newsworthy articles or announcements about full groups or individual members, music videos, MV teasers, image teasers, comeback announcements, official alternate-version music videos, behind-the-scenes videos related to an official release, televised performance videos, street performance videos, dance-practice videos, dance/song cover videos, karaoke performance videos, audio-only releases, official remixes/mashups, album discussion threads, variety appearances and segment clips including previews/teasers, webshorts and movie clips starring idols, international tour and concert announcements, official Makestar or other crowd funding announcements, chart achievements (All-Kill and PAK only), YouTube view milestones (100M, 250M, 500M, 1B only), sales records and milestones, fancafe milestones and announcements, any previously forbidden item that is especially newsworthy or viral

&gt; &gt;**c.)**	Items not appearing on either list will be approved or removed at moderator discretion.

&gt; \* **Newsworthy** stories contain new information that is interesting, controversial, or outside the scope of normal life.  For example, ""Taeyeon visits nail salon"" is not newsworthy, but ""Taeyeon hospitalized after contracting infection at nail salon"" would be newsworthy.  If the [News] flair tag looks wrong or doesn't seem to fit, then the submission probably isn't newsworthy.

----
Please give feedback regarding the two lists of forbidden and permitted items and make any suggestions you have for additions or changes to these lists.  Here are a few items we are especially seeking opinions about:

* **Fan-made remixes, mashups, and dance covers** - *currently: allowed - proposed: forbidden* - These posts usually get downvoted to oblivion, so we don't think they'll be missed, but it is a change in policy so it should be noted.  Also remember that this only covers group-specific content, so multi-group remixes and dance covers like the ""Korean Pharmacist"" will still be permitted.

* **Social media account openings** - *currently: allowed - proposed: forbidden* - With a new focus on newsworthiness for non-performance content, it seems that ""Idol opens Instagram/YouTube account"" isn't exactly newsworthy.  Certainly content on those accounts could be and would-be submittable, but simply the act of creating the account seems like it's better suited to the group-specific subreddits.  Do you agree or disagree?

* **Album sales** - *currently: sort-of allowed - proposed: forbidden* - For the most part, direct links to album/song purchase pages aren't permitted, but some still stick around like ""MNet Meet &amp; Greet"" packages.  Links to purchase things aren't news and aren't relevant for non-fans of the group so we propose removing them from the sub going forward.

* **Sales and Fancafe records and milestones** - *currently: allowed - proposed: allowed* - We have discussed in the past YouTube (100M views) and chart (All-Kills) milestone posts, but we should also discuss sales and fancafe numbers.  For example are posts like ""Group X breaks sales record"" or ""Group Y's fancafe reaches 100,000 members"" content you want to see on /r/kpop?

* **Web shorts and movie clips starring idols** - *currently: allowed - proposed: allowed* - A lot of idols are multi-talented and often branch out into acting, but this starts to blur the line of being kpop related and not.  If an idol makes a 15-second appearance on a kdrama or a 15-minute web short, do you want to see those clips on the subbreddit or would you prefer those be limited to the subreddits dedicated to those idols?

* **Idol Karaoke** - *currently: allowed - proposed: allowed* - Karaoke performances mostly range from barely passable to awful in quality, but there are occasional gems.  This covers the norebang style karaoke like [M2 Karaoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAQt96h9dXk) and [others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V22F-Y4G868).  These are technically performances, but is it something you want to see on r/kpop?

___

Once again, our goal here is to improve consistency in moderation so that you know what to expect when submitting content while still making sure you get to see the content you enjoy.  Please give us any and all feedback or questions you may have, and remember, this rule **only applies to group-specific content.**  Content that deals with multiple groups or agencies is not affected by this rule.  Once we have collected and processed all of your feedback, we will make revisions and let you know when the rule will go into effect.  Thank you for reading and we will continue to work very hard to make this subreddit an enjoyable place to visit and contribute.",107,81

1370,2017-02-17,2017,2,17,9,5uixe7,[FAN ACCOUNT] 170215 B1A4 Four Nights in the U.S. Tour - New York,splitsthesky,1487289808,"I dont really know how similar or not these US shows are to the Live Space shows they did the past couple weekends, because Ive only seen a little bit from those, so apologies if this turns out to be a rehashing of things people already know, but a while back when I mentioned here I was going to this show someone asked me to write a fanaccount, so.here I am.

Okay, so. It was supposed to be, doors at 7:00, concert at 8:00. Due toreal life (and also that [the venue](https://stage48.com/) is, honestly, in such a random out-of-the-way corner of Manhattan), I didnt get there until about 7:45. I expected everyone else would be inside, but when I arrived, everyone was still waiting outside. There were two lines, one general admission and one VIP, and they were only juuust about starting to move the VIP line (who all, Im pretty sure, were supposed to have early entry, even) in. People who had pre-ordered merch were supposed to pick it up inside before the show, but instead they brought it to us in line, which was a little messier but did seem to work out, in the end. The GA line didnt start moving until about 8:15, which meant by the time we actually got in (it wasnt a *long* line, but still) the concert had actually already started, which honestly I have never had happen at a concert, kpop or otherwise, even at KCON when its always less of a *line* outside and more of, just  a mob of people. I mean, Ive gotten into concerts late, but those times were my own doing, not because of the venue (apparently) completely disregarding set timings.  
I do have to say, though, even with all of this, and the fact that it was so windy and cold outside, everyone in line was really patient and calm and cheerful, which was really nice, nobody was whining or getting mad or anything, so +1 to BANAs, honestly.

Also (last venue complaint, I swear) once all us GA people got in, they made everyone go up to the balcony and then, if you wanted, you could go *back* down to the floor via a different set of stairs. Which, likewhy, but also it didnt really matter whether you had bought the $100 GA floor tickets or the $50 balcony ones, because you could go wherever you wanted.  
The nice thing about the venue, though, was it was super tiny, so even though by the time I actually made it to a spot on the floor I was more towards the back, I could still see really well; I feel like really wherever you were in there the boys were still so close, justby default, so the whole time they could see us or read fan signs and hear our responses to things, so that was nice, it made it feel more intimate.

Baro did most of the ments (as his English is the best of all of theirs), but he said that all of them had practiced their English for this, and you could tell they had, all of them said a couple lines every time even though Baro was carrying the bulk of it.

At the beginning Baro said theyd organized their set list mostly around Good Timing, their most recent album (which I did know, from seeing the Live Space setlist), so what they did instead was condense a bunch of their older singles into a medley for the middle of the show. Before that, though, they were asking us what our favorite of their songs was, and someone from the audience said Oh My Girls One Step, Two Steps (that [Jinyoung wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfh8okrsTnw)), which made the boys laugh, and so they did a bit of it acapella for us.  
Anyway, so having all these older songs combined meant we only actually got a couple lines of Beautiful Target (I mean we only got a bit of *all* of them, but Beautiful Target is objectively THE most important FOREVER, so), but they did bust out their [sprout dance](http://68.media.tumblr.com/4a65ae424b531784ca5a2e40bea8899d/tumblr_mv5i6pOtOn1s4lt1yo4_500.gif) for it, which was amazing. Also, now that Baro has pink hair again, them doing [Tried to Walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxLV7M1sdjg) was a very on-point throwback, which I appreciated (thats not *why* they put it in there, but still).

They did do some of their older songs in full, though, but there was definitely a strong showing of songs from Good Timing. The question I had going in was whether they were going to trust that we could do [Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV9t9kRBQd0) along with them, and the answer was.no, although they *did* ask us to sing along with them to a bunch of other songs, tovarying degrees of success (like, Sunmis verse in You was a little rough, but *everyone* knew Sweet Girl and A Lie [Jinyoung gave us a thumbs up, for that one]) soI dont know what happened, there. Actually the first time they said they wanted us to sing along with them, there was a smattering of shouts from the audience of Together/! but Baro quickly said, No, no, no and Gongchan shook his head and made a little X with his fingers.

They did most of the concert in 3-piece suits ([these ones](http://mimgnews1.naver.net/image/420/2017/02/08/120251726_45.jpg)), and the encore in hoodies, so they were definitely, visibly, overheating and sweating (everyone except Jinyoung took off their jackets near the end, but still), but it didnt stop them from killing their dance routines perfectly, or from playing around the whole time. All of them kept poking/bothering Sandeul as they passed him on stage, Gongchan kept going to the sides of the crowd to dance with them, Jinyoung was jamming out(/grandpa dancing) the entire time, even for their songs that didnt have choreography, CNU was *constantly* waving up to everyone on the balcony and shooting them hearts. Actually, between the five of them, seriously, in a two hour period, I have never been on the (general) receiving end of so. many. finger/hand hearts in my *entire life*. It was nice; theyre cute.

They did their ending ment before they broke for the encore mostly in Korean (Baros was half in English); there was an interpreter but I think there were a fair amount of people in the crowd who either spoke Korean or at least knew enough of it to get the basic jist, because a bunch of times everyone responded before the interpreter had even opened his mouth, which I think the boys found entertaining. Baro said this was their second time in the States but then realized it was actually their third, and Gongchan and Sandeul pretended to scold him about it, and then were giggling to themselves about it.

During the Time Machine medley they did, mostly, aptly, during A Glass of Water, Baro definitely spent almost the entire contents of 5(? 6? I lost count) bottles of water flinging them over the crowd, but in the middle of their encore he briefly disappeared off stage and then came back very proudly with an entire crate stacked with water bottles, and from that point til the end there was just, water everywhere. The other members joined in for a bit too, but it was mostly Baros doing, tbh. Id seen them [coming off stage](http://www.vlive.tv/video/22757) from Live Space all wet, but I didnt know why, butI guess this sort of thing is why. I definitely got a good amount of it, even mid-back as I was, so I can only imagine what it was like for people right at the front. But it was fun, though; they did the last chorus of Good Timing (the song) about a million times, so it was a nice big party atmosphere to end the show on.

The merch they had there was signed CDs and their official lightsticks. Id pre-ordered a CD, but that was supposed to be it; I love B1A4 but their lightstick never really grew on me, somehow. But on the way out, the merch table was right *there*, and I *had* the cash in my wallet, sothatpurchase happened. Post-concert high is real, guys. But I dont regret it, honestly, I think this way it has great memories attached to it, which is definitely a plus.

Ok so this is everything I had in my notes; I tried to make this as comprehensive a recap as possible, but honestly I have no idea if I succeeded or not. Mostly, though, it was a *blast*, I would definitely say if you like B1A4 and you have a chance to go see them in the future (even for the rest of this tour!) I would say do it, its a great time.

What is Duet Song Festival?


^taken ^from ^Wikipedia

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

1501,2017-02-18,2017,2,18,20,5us0nq,[FAN ACCOUNT] 170218 Show! Music Core NCT Dream Prerec,jolaurence,1487416492,"Call for: snacks, bathroom break, a pillow, whatever you need before you start this.

As usual, the notices for both MuCore and Inki went up late Friday afternoon while I was at work. During my break I read through the notices and realized that there was a requirement change. You didnt need to have you sound source but you did need to have the light stick to be in N1. I had the light stick so I was still gonna be N1. I sprinted out of work and took my nearly hour commute to the DMC where I met up with two friends in town for the weekend who wanted to try for the shows. So I took them with me. I got my check in number for both MuCore and Inki right away. Inki I dont know if I will get in or not. 

So, check in was supposed to start at 9 am but as usual it started an hour early. I noticed that lines were forming outside and I told my friends that it was starting. Our check in numbers were all by each other so that helped. My check in number was 420 (you can say the joke) and I was happy with that. The process went super quick today. All of it happened outside even though it was cold. After check in we waited for them to check what we had for tiers. Then they went and gave us our numbers. For this one I was 314. This is the best number I have had for MuCore. I was guaranteed in. I didnt get a poster though, Only the first 250 got that today. My friends got their number for their tier and then went to a different line to get fancards. As they were checking our fan cards, they told us to come back by 11 am aka they wanted us to warm up. YAY!!!!!!!!!! So I made a beeline to the bathroom because sometimes you just gotta go potty. 

Around 11, the lines started forming for tiers and we got ready to go in. My line was led in first and we went into the stage where we got to sit in for SF9 and BP Ranias prerecs. SF9 is so attractive. Im looking at you Rowoon. I had a feeling it was gonna be a full room for NCT Dream today as more people were going in during SF9s prerec and were waiting for seats. SF9 took a while with theirs because they were doing a lot of different camera angles. After SF9, they cleared out all of Fantasy (SF9s fanclub) and BP Ranias supporters came into standing followed by the N1 standing. BP Rania only had 5 fans. Their song was really good. Alex slayed the choreo. When they finished, their fans left and our boys went on.

Mark held a mic and led the introduction and was gonna give us a ment but one of the PDs came and took the mic since they were behind on time. They did one rehearsal and two full takes and all were fantastic. The fan chant was so loud each time. I didnt realize how loud it was until I watched the fan cam performance that MBC put on YouTube.They looked like adorable little princes with their outfits today. ACTUALLY THEY ARE PRINCES. THE PRINCES OF MY HEART. 

It was after the rehearsal take when something happened. Im putting this in here as a warning because this is a big no-no. When you go to the music shows and get into the room, you put your phone away. It is in your bag, Do not think about taking your phone out. If you do and are seen taking pictures, you will be kicked out and the entire fandom could end up getting kicked out as well. Is taking a blurry cell phone pic of your bias worth getting your entire fandom kicked out and penalized on shows? No. It isnt. So this girl was sitting on the stairs near me and during the rehearsal she was taking pictures or something and one of the fan support ladies saw her. As the PDs were watching playback, she walked over to the section of the stairs were the girl was sitting on (the girl was in the very back) and started yelling at her. Come here. Now. You broke the rule. Youre done. Come here. was essentially what the lady was saying in Korean. But the girl wouldnt move. She kept sitting. So another lady had to go up on the side by me, walk past the few girls (and one of the four fan boys in the audience today) to drag her out. We all looked at her. Glared at her. She had this look on her face that said I did nothing wrong but you did wrong girl. YOU COULD HAVE KICKED US ALL OUT BECAUSE OF YOUR ACTION. The other lady brought her down to the first fan support lady and she took the girls wrist and marked something on it. She was then led out to get reprimanded. Its not worth it guys. You dont want to be put on a list. You dont want to mire your fandom. You dont. So please if you are thinking about coming to Korea and getting into kfandom, dont do this. Just dont.

Anyway, back to the prerec. Why are the babies so adorable????? There was so much energy today. At the start of one of the takes, I want to say Mark and Haechan were the first ones out but I cant remember 100%. All of the members were out except for Jeno who was running up while pulling his pants up. He had to pee. Oh honey. After the finished, they brought out the mic for Mark and he said thank you to us all. He also mentioned the fan meeting happening at night and that they were excited for it. They said their greeting, bowed, and left. Also, Jisung looked so lost at the end. Wait. Were going? BABY! PROTECT THE BABY! We were then instructed to leave one section at a time. Since I was on the left side, that meant that I got to see the members leave. We waved at each of them as they left and then Mark went by so naturally I stood up. AND WE WAVED AT US! SDFN;KSAJDNKJHDF;JKSD IM FINE. As I left the room I saw my two friends and they got into the show! Those who were part of the 250 went to get their poster and the rest of us left. 

**MEMBERS TALK:**

**Jisung:** MY SWEET BABY CHICK! Every time I see him I get so emotional because I have watched him grow from really tiny baby to someone who is growing but is still a baby. Hes a lam, a sweet lamb who needs help on knowing where to go. The girl sitting next to me is also Jisung bias so we freaked out at the end of the recording. Im so excited to see what he can become in the next few years. MY BABY!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. Im such a proud mom. 

**Chenle:** Chenle walks on stage. Screams. Chenle sits down, Screams. Chenle dances. Screams. Chenle sings. Screams. Chenle looks adorable. Screams. Chenle exists. Screams. WE ARE ALL EMOTIONAL OVER THIS YOUNG LAD. WHO ARE WE??????????????? Seriously he is stealing my heart and breaking it. Let noona live.

**Jeno:** HOLY SWEET MOTHER OF. JENO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Like, every time he moves on stage I get this rush of emotions. Why is it that with NCT Dream I have this strong sense of pride? Also, Jenos hair is BEAUTIFUL.

**Renjun:** Who said it was okay for you to become a Mr. Steal-Yo-Girl? Honestly every time he did something we screamed. Hes on the path of true bias wrecker, I just know it. Renjun stans, how do you cope with him? HOW?????????????

**Haechan:** You know my post about Chenle? Imagine that but multiply it by 10. Dream is where Haechan shines. HE JUST SHINES. HE SINGS. WE SCREAM. HE DANCES. WE SCREAM. HE EXISTS AND WE SCREAM. WE ARE JUST NOT WORTHY TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE AS HAECHAN. Sorry for the caps but I get so emotional over Haechan. HE ISNT EVEN MY BIAS. I cant wait for him to get that recognition he deserves. 

**Mark:** Mark Lee stresses me out. How is someone so talented at such a young age and also so wonderful and hard working and angelic and perfect and and why??????? Is it because hes Canadian? Is it because hes Mark Lee? Mark Lee in Dream aka Mark the Oppa aka a life ruiner. Im pretty sure this year Mark is just gonna come for my soul and wreck my NCT bias list. Every time he does something on stage Im a mess. Even during playback, all of us watching it scream when Mark is on screen. SM, you struck gold with this kid. BUT PLEASE LET HIM REST. 

I just really love NCT and I really love Dream. I love these kids and I want them to get everything in the world honestly. ",28,81

1624,2017-02-20,2017,2,20,12,5v2cz9,"With Krystal's recent song with Glen Check's Kim June One, a look at their label Beasts and Natives Alike",basedsoma,1487561918,"With Krystal's recent song with Kim June One, some people might be curious about the artist and how they (and other Beasts and Natives Alike artists) collaborated with such big names. Some might be familiar with BANA for a variety of different reasons. 

**Beasts and Natives Alike** was started by former SM Entertainment A&amp;R Kim Keyon (). Management includes other former SM employees as well, and as such, they have a good and working relationship with SME. However, they are very far away from being a pop label. While they have a variety of sounds, common genres of their artists include hip hop, electronic, future beats, R&amp;B, and indie. They are very minimalistic with their aesthetic and philosophy, as you might have guessed from the music video. Their artists are multifaceted and highly regarded in terms of talent and artistry in the Korean hip hop/underground scene.

**E SENS**

BANA's biggest and premier artist is **E SENS** (). If you're not into Korean hip hop, you might just know him as former Supreme Team member (with Simon Dominic) and his infamous beef with Gecko and Amoeba Culture. In Korea, and specifically the Korean hip hop scene, he is highly regarded for his artistry and lyricism. His 2015 album, [*The Anecdote*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSjE20-1q4I&amp;list=PLI2EuneCrcnZLOhCksasjwexor1rzur0s), was released before his 18-month incarceration for marijuana possession and consumption. It won *Album of the Year* and *Best Rap &amp; Hip Hop Album* at the 2016 Korean Music Awards. He was recently released and seems to slowly starting activities.

**KIM XIMYA**


Speaking of *The Anecdote*, the one and only feature on the entire album was from rapper **Kim Ximya** (). He is under BANA as a part of the duo XXX. Currently just 21 years old, you might be more familiar with his work than you'd think; he has writing credits on Red Velvet's *Ice Cream Cake*, *Dumb Dumb*, NCT U's *The Seventh Sense*, and lyrics credits on EXO's *Call Me Baby*, *Love Me Right*, as well as SHINee's *Hold You* and *Tell Me What To Do*. His music as XXX, along with his solo work, is different from this kind of pop sound, however. For his solo work/features, he opts for a more alternative pop or electronic sound, such as with singer This Is Manner, [*Reckless*](https://soundcloud.com/redlightdistrictrld/reckless-feat) and [*Saturday*](https://soundcloud.com/redlightdistrictrld/saturday-feat).

**FRNK**

The second half of duo XXX is DJ and producer **FRNK**. Along with producing all songs for XXX, he has worked on the official f(x) - [*4 Walls Remix*](https://soundcloud.com/xxxofficial/fx4wallsfrnkremix), which was featured at the 4 Walls showcase, as well as at MAMA 2015. He also DJs and performs at popular Seoul venues such as Cakeshop and The Henz Club.

**XXX**

XXX, made up of the aforementioned Kim Ximya and FRNK, is an alternative hip hop/electronic duo. While their music may be harder to digest for someone not used to the sound, they are recognized for their talent and creativity, and actually gathered a lot of attention from big Korean hip hop labels before signing with BANA. After signing, they built up a lot of anticipation with loosies such as [*Yves*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RMdIeg3ayU) and [**](https://soundcloud.com/xxxofficial/xxx). They also were featured on popular French electronic label, Kitsune, along with Beats 1 Radio by DJ Julie Adenuga and HYPETRAK. Their debut album, KYOMI, was released in July 2016. The title track is [Flight Attendant*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxPojCojjVs) (MV). After their album, they released another collaboration with the label Kitsune, [*How Feet Is Your Love*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTef1GTvbnY). They have performed at various selective venues, such as Seoul Fashion Festival 2016, in Japan for Kitsune's Asian Tour, and renowned Korean fashion boutique BOONTHESHOP's Renewal Grand Opening. They will also be at SXSW 2017 next month.

**GLEN CHECK**

Indie/electronic band Glen Check is made up of singer/producer/guitarist Kim June One, who recently released a solo single with f(x)'s Krystal, and bassist/synth Hyuk Jun Kang. After the band's formation in 2011, they have only received critical acclaim for their projects. They have won multiple awards at the Korean Music Awards. They also have hundreds of thousands of plays on Soundcloud for their remixes, such as French house artist Cherokee's [*Teenage Fantasy*](https://soundcloud.com/cherokee-official/teenage-fantasy-glen-check-remix) and Sistar's [*Touch My Body*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwlHr1l_AkA). Kim June One also has a song with Kim Ximya, [*Fakin'*](https://soundcloud.com/glen-check/june-one-kim-fakin-feat-of-xxx-rough-version). Both artists play DJ sets and perform at various venues in Seoul.

BTS however has greater reach to fans and more different styles, better songwriters so I guess that played a part.

Before that, these are the K-pop songs that I actually knew.",kyuujo,1487661858,"Disclaimer: First time posting, so I'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this/the right format! Please let me know if anything is wrong and I'll edit the post accordingly :)

So a bit of context. In my country, K-pop hits big in around 2007-2008. K-pop songs were being played on local radios, dance groups formed and performed at local festivals/conventions, a lot of my friends became stans. I stuck to listening to US-UK music though, since at that time I couldn't fathom how one could listen to a song that one doesn't understand. (Of course that has changed now.)

Even so, there were some K-pop songs that broke out of the Hallyu bubble that I was avoiding. These are the songs that really (almost) everybody knew the chorus or the tune or the dance moves. I thought it'd be interesting to share these songs (in chronological order, as far as I remember. Because funnily, some songs didn't get popular in my country until a long time after they are released in Korea.)

- [Wonder Girls - Nobody] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFjP-OJ7Bh4)
This was probably the first K-pop song that hit big in my country. Everyone knows the signature dance move 'Nobody nobody but you' (clap clap point clap). I remember even seeing this performed at wedding ceremonies (which was weird, cause not a lot of people were learning Korean in my country back then). This remains one of the most, if not the most popular K-pop song in my country.

- [Girls' Generation - Gee] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ)
The 'gee gee gee gee gee' part in the chorus was really catchy, and a lot of people knew it. A staple of local radio back then.

- [Big Bang - Lies] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cv3phvP8Ro)
I only recently realized the title of this song is 'Lies' and not 'I'm sorry but I love you.' It was quite well-known, especially because of that catchy English part. (Funny thing, Big Bang wasn't played a lot on local radio if I remember correctly.)

- [2NE1 - Fire] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AfuuRbgGo)
The most well-known part is the 'eh eh eh eh' in the beginning. 

- [2NE1 - I Am The Best] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o)
I would say this is among the most popular K-pop songs in my country. There is even a parody of it in my mother tongue, which translates to 'you wash dishes and I'll sweep the floor', since that's what the Korean lyrics sound like in my mother tongue.

- [Big Bang - Haru Haru] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzCbEdtNbJ0)
The MV for this one was really popular, if I recall correctly. Not to mention, Sungha Jung was quite popular at that time, and his guitar cover for the song made it even more popular. (For the longest time, the only K-pop song on my playlist).

- [Super Junior - Sorry Sorry] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QA3m58DQw)
Another really, really big song that is probably the initiation of a lot K-pop fans. The dance moves were really popular even among non-fans.

- [Trouble Maker - Trouble Maker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-zRAQmKUkI)
The beginning whistle-like sounds was everywhere. 

- [T-ARA - Lovey Dovey] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ0djllyqwY)
Even if you don't know the rest of the song, you'll know 'Ravey Ravey Dovey ah ah ah ah'.

- [T-ARA - Day by Day] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzLDhl11xho)
'Kiss me baby I'll must be stay here day by day'.

- [Psy - Gangnam Style] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0)
This one is a given.

- [Big Bang - Fantastic Baby] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbokV76tkU)
This one was huge as well. I remember a lot of people parodying GD's hair in the MV. There's even a well-recognized name for the song in my mother tongue (which is a loose but funny translation of Fantastic Baby).

- [BTS - Dope] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM)
After Fantastic Baby, there doesn't seem to be a song that really stands out, probably due to the influx of new groups. But like in a lot of other countries, this song is well-known for the choreography and MV compared to other songs released at the same time. I wouldn't say it's on the same calibre of popularity as the rest of the songs on the list, but it's more well-known than other songs of the same period.

Honorable mentions (songs that were quite popular as well but not to the extent of the above songs):

- [Beast - Fiction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAzWT8mRoR0)

- [Shinee - Ring Ding Dong] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roughtzsCDI)

- [Girls' Generation - The Boys] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pA_Tou-DPI)

- [Taeyang - Eyes, Nose, Lips] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwuAPyOImoI)

- [Big Bang - Bang Bang Bang] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw)

Edit: I thought I'll add some observations, after I'm finished with the list:

- Funny thing, I don't remember Girls' Generation - Genie at all. I know the name of the song, but it felt like it never passed through the Sone bubble. I was quite surprised to learn that it's one of their biggest songs together with Gee.

- Even though I didn't include them in the list, DB5K was big. Their fandom in my country is quite large. But I don't really remember any songs from them that reached the non-fans (not even Mirotic or Doushite, which is quite weird).

- We loved T-ARA a whole lot (not so sure after the scandal though). I only listed 2 of their songs, but Cry Cry and Roly Poly was quite big as well.

- I kind of expected Infinite - The Chaser or Be Mine, consider how those songs are quite big. I supposed I overestimated them? Or they are just not popular in my own country.

- EXO has quite a substantial fandom, but I don't recall hearing about Growl or Overdose before I started listening to K-pop.

1782,2017-02-22,2017,2,22,2,5vcnyr,[Fan Account] B1A4 Four Nights in the US: San Francisco,ra1nnn,1487696947,"First off I would like to apologize for posting this a bit late. I was sick last week so I had a backlog of homework + midterm this Wednesday but I found some time to finally write this out.

A bit of background of myself: I'm a huge fan of Oh My Girl since Liar Liar era and during summer of last year (probably during Windy Day era) I checked out B1A4 since they're both under WM (my younger sister is also a big fan of B1A4 so she helped me out too). I fell in love with B1A4 and WM Entertainment as a company for **many** reasons but one reason would be how WM artists are so consistently talented. Towards the end of summer I also watched Moonlight Drawn by Clouds which made me fall in love with Jinyoung.

My sister and I arrived at San Francisco at 4:30PM and parked in Fifth &amp; Mission Parking Garage right across Westfield SF. (If you're ever in SF for a concert at The Warfield I highly recommend you park at Fifth &amp; Mission Parking Garage, the rates are decent and the walk to and from The Warfield is safe.) We spend half an hour walking around the shopping mall and then walked down Market St. for food at Flying Falafel. 

At 5:45PM we started lining up for balcony seating (we bought the cheapest seats in the back) and I noticed a few people were receiving their signed albums they've preordered before the concert. I asked a staff for my album and handed my driver's license to them so they can retrieve it for me. The guy came back with my album and I was examining the beautifully signed album until my sister turned the album around to see that we won a photo op with B1A4!! My sister screamed at the top of her lungs and was dancing around while everyone in line was staring at her. We only bought one signed album between the two of us so of course I let her do the photo op at the end of the concert. Remember when I said that we had $50 seats in the back? Well we started moving in at around 7 and was directed to the middle balcony where the $75 seats are because there were a lot of spaces left in the middle area so it's was basically a free upgrade to a better view!

Now here's the embarrassing thing about my memory, I had so much fun I can't remember everything other than a few big fragments here and there. I'm going to miss a lot of details here but please bear with me, I had a lot of fun! The entire set was a mix between songs from their latest album (Melancholy, A Lie, Drunk On You, I'll Find You, etc.) and their older songs which some were mixed together during their ""Time Machine"" part of their set where fans had to scream really loud to power on their time machine. In between songs Baro talked about visiting Pier 39 and talking about how BANAs are prettier than crabs (lol). Towards the ""end"" they performed I'll Find You then the group left the stage. The stage was dark and the fans were chanting encore then Baro said a few things into the mic before the entire group came back on stage wearing Good Timing hoodies and light wash jeans. They started their encore with Sparkling and then Drunk On You. All of them were splashing fans with water throughout the concert but really went all out during the encore, especially Baro and Shinwoo. When they did Good Timing as their very last song the group was splashing so much water onto the crowd, probably three crates of water bottles were used. The stage was really wet towards the end and I noticed Gongchan slipped on the water one time but fortunately it was a really small slip. 

After the concert we lined up for the photo op and only my sister was allowed into the hi touch area so I waited outside behind closed doors. After all the VIPs had their hi touch she and a few others went in as a group for the photo and she told me Sandeul made eye contact with her and Jinyoung put his arm around her shoulder for the photo. hen she came out to see me she was just melting and told me that she was starstruck the entire time she was in there.

[I took ~600 photos that night, here's four of my favorite ones](http://imgur.com/a/A4FYY)

This was actually my first kpop concert + seeing kpop idols in real life. I had an amazing night and I'm really happy I went to see B1A4 live. I will definitely see them again if they're in SF and I'm praying Oh My Girl will have their own concerts in the US too (please WM PLEASE).",25,60

I remember when it first debuted it seemed like it was way too sexualized for kpop. Nowadays it seems pretty tame. Although admittedly it's [alternate version](https://youtu.be/BkDEWopV8w4) is still very awkward to watch and I don't think I've seen anything like that in kpop yet.

Anyone else have any music videos that stand out to them?

1840,2017-02-22,2017,2,22,15,5vh35j,[Discussion] Songs with [a] Notable/Notorious Female Rap Verse[s],bluemysteric,1487743970,"*I want to preface by mentioning that this was my theme recommendation for the [weekly game](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5v2uxh/game_weekly_theme_song_theme_past_relationships/), but since my post wasn't getting much points, and I want to discuss this, I withdrew/deleted my post. Also brohammerhead (I can't tag you so I hope you see this!) seemed interested, so let's not wait for it; get into it!*

By ""notable"" I don't necessarily mean good but I added ""notorious"" in case your connotation with ""notable"" is more positive. Let's discuss songs by female idol groups and/or soloists where you see the title and the first thing that comes to your mind is the rap verse. Please feel free to explain what about it you enjoy or what about it you don't enjoy.

**HARD MODE: No ""Dumb Dumb""**

I'll start of course!

The good:

* Amber's verse in ""[4 Walls](https://youtu.be/4j7Umwfx60Q?t=59)""  This is one of Amber's best verses despite being notorious for her raps. The tone of her voice matches the mood of the song, the flow is divine and mysterious in a way, and the English weaves its way effortlessly with the Korean. I have seen people say the ""Four walls / New walls / New world"" bit at the end is off-putting and I do agree it's rather strange in comparison to the rest of the verse's flow, but it helps bring the energy further up when Luna comes back in with her bright voice, so I don't mind it.
* I can talk about LE all damn day, but I'll just highlight a couple of verses of hers: ""[L.I.E](https://youtu.be/RnDSODY7bVE?t=117)""  I don't like this track altogether, but her verse is what keeps me from hating it (shout-out to that clap-clap-clap part). What's interesting to me is that they feel like two different songs which I didn't mind in ""Hot Pink"" but in this instance I didn't like the rest of ""L.I.E""; and ""[With Out U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duWBRJBIt-E)""  I like to use this for an example of seamlessly blending rap into a song because regardless of LE's sharp voice, the speed of her parts aren't jarringly different from the speeds of the non-rap verses and chorus, and nor is her voice a wildly different tone from the mood of the song
* Good ol' CL in ""[Gotta Be You](https://youtu.be/zdKTgwffmdo?t=105)""  That flow is glorious and how it transitions smoothly into the...I think refrain is what it's called [the ""    /  lets go /  rewind /  X O"" part] displays the more frantic/desperado~ (if you will) feeling the second verse carries
* 4Minute's ""[Blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdxGTFu5oEM)""  Listen to the whole song if you haven't already. GO THE FUCK OFF, HYUNA AND JIYOON.
* This is the divisive one, I'm sure of it, but I love it god damnit: SNSD's ""[I Got a Boy](https://youtu.be/wq7ftOZBy0E?t=159)""  I don't agree with having Yoona in this part, I'll start with that. I'm still not good with recognizing Yuri, Sooyoung, and Yoona's voices in Soshi songs, so when I go back and watch these performances and see Yoona right before Hyoyeon I'm like ""Wait a minute..."" lol. Something about her voice doesn't work here but it does at the same time? I think it has to do with the lyrics themselves and the tone of the song which is wildly animated, so I let it pass, but if someone else did this part I probably wouldn't hesitate to be like PERFECT WONDERFUL GRAND. But about the verses themselves, it's just a cute part that makes me happy. This song wouldn't be the song that it is without it.

And for the not so good:

* I love Jimin from AOA dearly and I love this song, but god damn if the verse in ""[Good Luck](https://youtu.be/gZusjfI8PdQ?t=162)"" is just...please. I don't call Jimin a genius rapper - I think she's fine but nothing extraordinary - but I don't know man... This is an ""I AM THE RAP VERSE"" kind where the flow doesn't fit, there's nothing to signal to you that it's coming other than you being used to AOA tracks, and it doesn't make sense! like it's just there so Jimin can say something in the song and that's unfortunate.
* Another case of ""Let's just give them something to say!"" in the form of WJSN's ""[I Wish](https://youtu.be/GiT8zS8uIpg?t=155)"" with my girl Exy. It's clear this is notable because it's the only rap verse in the whole damn thing and it's so short. Not to mention it's much faster than the rest of the verses and chorus in the song, so it's just...meh. Thank god they don't make Exy walk on stage and then off. This especially bothers me because I really like her voice and her flow but it just doesn't work with this kind of song and I WISH they didn't run with it.

Your turn!

Park's 'Fire' MV. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVpMNQVE8dQ&amp;t=86s -- At 0:58-1:01 the choreography almost matches TWICE's earlier choreography for J. Y. Park's 'Fire' featuring Conan O'Brien and Steve Yeun and Jimin Park.

 Their choreography can be seen in the background here from 1:58-2:01:.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2mqrzKHb3w

It's most likely just a coincidence that they happen exactly a minute apart in each video, but the choreo matching seems intentional. It's cool to think that small parts in videos can show up again later. Are there any other notable ""Easter Eggs"" or choreography callbacks you have noticed in other performers?",14,18

2017,2017-02-24,2017,2,24,7,5vtnft,Have you ever felt pressured to expand your kpop playlist?,ridingtherush,1487889376,"I know that there are some people who will judge other people if they only like very popular kpop groups and say that they have basic or bad taste because of it. Or that they aren't real kpop fans if they only like a few groups. I think there's this weird mindset that if you like a kpop group that you should check out every group. I mean that's just stupid because people shouldn't feel pressured to check out everyone. Some fans once had this stupid fight on twitter saying that kpop fans should respect the history of kpop and listen to older groups. No just because you're a fan of a group doesn't mean you need to go listen to everyone that's in the same genre. I don't expect newer fans to check out older groups especially with how much the music has changed.  
One thing I'm tired of is fans shoving their faves music down everyone's throats because they think their faves are superior. Yeah how about no. I'm all for checking out new groups, but if you're going to insult my faves then I'm not going to be inclined to check out yours. 
Sorry for the way this was worded lol I didn't really know how to say it. But after hanging around the kpop community on social media and on forums I have personally felt some need to look into more groups in order to better fit in the community. ",16,0

&gt;Seven celebrity artists choose a non-celebrity partner from a selection of people who submit performances to perform a duet of their choice. Each pair is given exactly 4 minutes to perform and earn votes from the 500 live voters in the audience and the celebrity panel. The order is selected by the current first place duo, and with the exception of the pilot episodes, the winner of the previous episode chooses the first performance. The voting results are shown directly on the screen behind the performers, and at the end of all the performances, the duo with the highest vote count is the winner for the episode. The winners are invited back to the show for the next episode, and another duo is chosen for ""The Duet You Want To See Again"" by the audience to be revived for the next episode as well.

Todays recording went by super quick so this will be super quick as well. It wont be as detailed either as I will explain as I go. My check in number was 338 and my official number was N1-232. Yeah. It was interesting really because there werent as many of us going for the show today. They also stopped giving out the fan cards since it was the third weekend of promotions. After they signed our fan cards, they let us wander off until 1 pm which was when we had to get into our proper lines. There was also some filming happening over at MBC today for their new weekend drama. That was interesting. Since there were a lot of groups doing prerec today (BTS and Twice were the big ones), we stayed in our area and then transferred next to MuCores building. I also counted four fanboys today. Fanboys are precious and most be protected in the world of boy groups. Its so rare to find fanboys who stan boy groups. 

Prerec was supposed to start at 2:05 pm and it started a little after. I was on the left hand side again but this time the second row. AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! We saw the boys come out and started screaming and the fan support lady told us to calm down. We sat in for CLCs prerec today and SORN! SORN!!!!!!!!! I LOVE SORN SO MUCH! SORN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They slayed. I LOVE THEM. 

Then, the boys came out and we screamed. Renjun forgot something so he ran back off stage but ran into Jeno in the process. They were already in position before all of standing could get in. The girls were starting to sit down on the ground when one of the PDs said that they were standing so they should go to standing. Like I said: we were rushed. That meant the boys were rushed. They did two takes, back to back and didnt have time for a break. Both takes the fan chants were so loud. The first take was amazing as was the second. Between the takes, water was brought out for the boys to take sips from. They were exhausted. The choreo is super high energy so by the end the boys are exhausted. I felt so sorry for them. Before the second take, we were all screaming really loud. One girl was screaming so loud that Jisung was startled, DON'T SCARE THE CHICK! After the second take, they were rushed off the stage so they bowed quickly and then left. They waved to us who were at the sides while leaving. We were all rushed out as well. Usually we take turns leaving but today they literally said hurry up so we left really fast. We were in and out within 20 minutes today. We only had about 10 minutes with the boys. As we were leaving the next group for prerec was already ready. Like I said: rushed.

Haechan once again was shining. He just owns the stage and Im so glad he is in Dream because he deserves all the spotlight. ALL OF IT. HES SO PRECIOUS! If you bias Haechan, you are in for a ride. A very nice ride with a wonderful view to success. There are actually rumblings online that Haechan might be the actual True Ace Lee Sooman was talking about so ????? 
I really didnt have a lot of time to focus on the members since everything was so quick today but all of them were fantastic. I really love Dream and they are so adorable. I love my kids. ",9,62

Firstly, I'd like to say that **I will not tolerate throwing shit on ANY idols of ANY group** on this post. This is meant to be a **DISCUSSION**, not a HATE thread. If you want to hate, please go somewhere else. Your hate is not welcome here. Thus, I hope that idol names and groups will only be mentioned when it helps to ILLUSTRATE a point, otherwise, it might be better to leave it out. 


* Q: Are there certain members from any group that you've questioned at being included? Be it that they don't work well with the general group dynamic, idol-related skills are questionable, group already has all the roles covered adequately, no role in the group, does not contribute anything towards the group, etc. 


As we all know, the competition between trainees is fierce and there are countless many trainees that slave for years yet never make the cut for debut. Hence, I find these cases of ""blackhole"" idols (be it at debut or in their later years) making the cut for debut, very intriguing. ""Basic idol skills"" is up to you to define, but I'm looking at singing, dancing, variety and maybe stage presence mostly (and basing the text here on aforementioned definition). 


Of course, contributing to group dynamics is also important, but imo (be it misplaced or not) members of a group should be able to at least contribute something to the main purpose of the group - which is music / performance. I know there are some who use the idol route to gain an easier path to another area of the industry like acting or modelling. Let's leave those idols out since its another topic for another discussion on another day (:


I'd like to get a feel of what the community thinks of having ""blackhole"" members in a group. The reasons why you think a certain member has been included or how the member contributes to the group in a little-known way, or just a general factor that contributes to them being selected to debut. As long as you have a constructive point to make, please feel free to share!

I've always been rather perplexed by this, seeing as English is not even an official language in ROK. 

I come from a country in which the ability to speak English is (unfortunately and incorrectly so), at times, used as a measure of intelligence. Despite the fact that English only happens to be 1 of our 11 official languages.

So why would it be important or of interest whether or not a Kpop idol can speak English? I've seen some people in the Kpop community ridiculing idols for their pronunciation of English words or not being able to speak it. While others get (borderline weird) praise for being able to speak it. Even video compilations of idols speaking English!

What are the reasons behind this fascination with the English language in Kpop? Is it to cater to international fans?",43,9

So as the title says I'm writing a web comic based on fictitious Korean pop groups and I'd like to know what fans of K-pop would like to see in it? 

A little background is that currently I'm about to start full time work so I can only work on characters story and panels sparingly once this work has slowed down I will start posting the comic. When that time comes I will make an actual promotional post for it but for now I'm just working hard to make a story that I would be happy to read and other fans would be happy to read. Some notes on the story is that it's about a star who becomes the centre of lots of rumors because of the delinquent he used to be. He makes a lot of mistakes trying to overcome these rumors but eventually grows and matures. I'd like to show a lot of character growth and some of the more questionable things to do with K-pop even if they aren't the nicest things to think about. I want to make a comic that shows the positive and negatives about the Korean pop industry as well as show things that other fans want to see.",38,19

Its also gonna be pretty short as well since it was a week ago and I cant remember that much anymore. I was number 98 of 100 for the fans who got in. YAY!!!!!!! My friend was number 99 so we were freaking out until we had to come back. We were even freaking out as we went in. We sat in for the postrecs of Akmu and SF9 and both were a blast really. 

Dream did theirs first. Their suits were gray and looked good on them but the poor babes were overheating. The first take was the rehearsal and the music cut off so they had to start it again. Rehearsal take try number 2 was flawless. We were sitting on the side where they enter so we could see inside the waiting area since they went backstage to cool down. My friend had a clear shot of watching Mark get touched up. She was giving me a play by play. Meanwhile, I was watching the playback on the very small computer monitor because I am trying to figure out the choreo. Still. I know. But Im obsessed with this choreo and each time I end up in a recording I notice something different. 

For the first take Mark and Haechan went out first and the rest of the members followed. The PD wanted them to move closer so they scooted up towards the front and we screamed. Cause yeah. First take was really good as usual.  For the second take, Renjun came up first but no one else came up. He looked so lost. So then they all started coming up. Before one of the takes the members were hitting each other. The second take had them focusing on the camera that gives close ups which of course Mark found the camera and winked at it. A lot. Haechan shined as usual. Overall, we had about 20 minutes of the boys performing. The kids are just so darn good I cant handle it. I mean I can but I also cant. 

They left the stage and then we got to sit and watch Akmu. Those who were standing for NCT moved to the back for Akmu's fans to be in the front. Akmu was so good ahhhhhhh!!!!!! They were teasing their fans left and right. At the end of their final take, the two of them were trying to see who was taller with their chins in the air. 

After Akmu ended, it was SF9's turn and the Akmu fans moved to the back so Fantasy could come up. SF9 is not only hot but really good. Their fans are loud. Fantasy be proud. In between takes, they went to the waiting area to cool down and I was having a hard time focusing. LOOK. I JUST LOVE ROOKIE GROUPS. I LOVE THEM. Zuho and Rowoon were arguing about where the center of the stage was. It was so adorable. Every time they figured it out, they started arguing again. Also, Rowoon. Please. I love you so much.

2228,2017-02-26,2017,2,26,23,5wa79g,[FAN ACCOUNT] B1A4 Four Nights in the US Tour - LA VIP (w/Hi-Touch),DontBeABillHader,1488117681,"Hey all! I wasn't sure whether I should post this or not as there have already been two other amazing fanaccounts of the concert from other cities, but I noticed that neither of them were LA or VIP, so I decided to write one up! I'm a little wordy and I got tired like halfway through writing this lmao so please hang in there if you can! 

So, starting off with a little bit of background: B1A4 was one of my first groups and is still one of my top two groups to this day. I've been a huge fan of them for what seems like a long time and having the chance to see them live was such a blessing, especially since I live in Seattle and the closest they came to us was LA. B1A4 is also the only group I collect signed albums for -- their music helped me through some really difficult times in my life, so they mean a lot to me. 

The day of the concert, I got to the venue at like 1pm after trying to figure out the LA bus system, failing, and deciding to get a Lyft instead. When I got there, the line was already pretty long, and I couldn't see where VIP was until I headed upstairs straight to the entrance of the Novo. I went to the front and got my wristband and then headed in to meet with the girls I had met on Twitter who were already there -- they had been there since 5:30am, and weren't even first in line! Apparently a LOT of people had come the night before to camp out. 

The balcony held 150 of I believe 500 VIP ticketholders, and they cut us off pretty quickly after I got there. It was mostly covered so when it started to drizzle we hardly felt it at all. There were some Facebook groups doing giveaway contests and overall it was a great time, especially since everyone there was very clearly a diehard BANA -- we all had lightsticks, sprout pins/headbands, etc. It was really fun and really cute! From where I was up in VIP, everything seemed to be pretty organized, but I don't know what it was like in the line on the street. 

I had preordered a signed B1A4 album hoping to possibly get a photo op, and while asking around I learned that they would probably be handing out preorders before we went inside. The time came for the doors to open, however, and we were informed that B1A4's plane had landed late and the boys were still signing albums inside. It was only a little bit later, though, that they started taking IDs and bringing us our signed albums (I didn't get photo op, unfortunately) and the doors opened only a few minutes late. 

As soon as doors were opened, VIP rushed inside, and we all packed into the front by the stage, as it was floor standing only for VIP. I was in the perfect center, third row -- only two girls were in front of me, both pretty short and one I believe a Jinyoung fansite master. My bias is Sandeul so I was hoping to see him belting out some high notes from where I was standing! To kind of give you an idea of where I was, here's a [fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZrjKxyVmRQ) someone took. I'm probably like directly behind whoever took this, just a bit closer to the center. 

Everyone filed in and then the show started. The lights went out and there were some crazy strobe lights, I'm glad I'm not personally sensitive to those because that shit was wild. B1A4 came out in the dark and then the stage lit up and everyone was *losing their shit*. It was a tiny-ass venue so everyone was jumping up and down and you could hear all the cheers, it was really cute. 

Here's the full setlist (full of mostly their new stuff), with a breakdown of ones I found particularly memorable:

* Melancholy - the first song, and god did they look good. They were in these plaid suits that they must've been burning up in and everyone was shouting so loud I could barely hear but I was so excited, I thought I was legitimately going to cry. 
* In the Air 
 * First ment here, it was like an intro. I don't know what it was but CNU and Sandeul were *really cute* with each other that night. People were shouting *a lot*, it was cute at first but at points I was like...jesus y'all, even B1A4 are getting annoyed lmao. This is where Baro said the setlist was mostly centered around their newest album. 
* Oh My God - I thought the hats they wore during the choreo for this song were so funny. I don't know why. But this song is so catchy and they were really playing up the ""sexiness"" so we were all going pretty wild for it. 
* Nightmare
* You - They asked us to sing along with them, holding out their mics to us at one point. I was surprised how many people knew the lyrics! 
* Crushing On You Again - During the song they all stood behind Sandeul and made fun of him. It was super cute. They had us sing this one back to them too! 
* Yesterday
* Sweet Girl - SO FUCKIN GOOD. God, I love this song. They looked amazing and the singing was incredible. It was hot af too. Gongchan in particular sounded really good that night.
* Lonely - The dancing in particular was good during this song. 
* A Lie - Man, everyone knew this song. 
* In My Dreams - They brought out stools for this! It was just straight singing. I loved the lighting for this song particularly -- whenever each member sang, a spotlight lit them up individually. It provided a really cool, intimate effect. 
* If - I love this song.
 * Another ment! They asked us what song we wanted them to sing and then they did Only One acapella. It was really good. Their harmonies are really on point!  
* OK, Beautiful Target, Baby I'm Sorry, Baby Good Night, Tried to Walk, What's Happening, Solo Day, Glass of Water - This was my favorite bit! I'm an old B1A4 stan at heart so I was waiting for them to break out their older stuff. Basically the idea of this was a ""time machine"" back to their debut, and it was glorious. They did at least a verse and the chorus from each era, with all the original dances intact. The fanchants during this section were *insane*. Everyone knew every fanchant. On top of that, What's Happening is my favorite song in all of kpop (and probably the world) so I was feeling indescribably *ethereal* seeing it live. At one point they did the sprout dance and I started crying. I also believe this was the first showing of the fucking water bottles. Baro brought out a crate of open water bottles and he and Jinyoung just *went* for it. Also, at one point, CNU did this ridiculously sexy body roll while taking off his outer jacket -- but then right afterwards Sandeul laughed at him and did one too, which was crazy adorable. 
* How Many Times - Baro kept asking us ""are you ready for a shower???"" and tossing more water at us, with Jinyoung in second place as the person doing the most showering. By the end of this I was pretty soaked since I was right in the splash zone!
 * Ending ment. Each boy said something, which was really sweet. 
* I'll Find You
* Drunk on You - The first song of the encore! B1A4 all came out in hoodies with their album logo on it. There was so much them/us interaction going on, I felt really blessed haha. And I love this song too! 
* Sparkling - The third return of the water bottles. It's getting pretty bad now, at this point I had to take my glasses off and wipe them on my shirt so I could keep watching! Also Baro dabbed and I wanted to Die. 
* Good Timing - This is where the water got *really* insane. At one point Baro looked at me straight in the eye, I shook my head because I was already *so soaked*, and he went straight for me because of it. Yikes, Baro, why you gotta be like that but also damn was it fun. I ended up really wet afterwards, and when everyone kind of did a wetness comparison after the show while we were waiting for hi-touch a lot of the other fans were actually surprised by how wet I got -- I probably got the worst out of all of it. It was legitimately like being in a Seattle rain. Every time I thought it was done the boys repeated the chorus again and kept at it. It didn't help that confetti went off too so there were bits of paper plastered to my hair and face! They did have a water fight, though, which was fun to watch and really cute.  

Afterwards CNU took off his sweater (he was down to a tank top and oh my god his *arms*) and tried to toss it at us but Baro stopped him because to be honest there probably would've been a riot; some of the fans were kind of poorly behaved. Some girl (not even a BANA? she didn't have a sprout or anything even though everyone else did, yikes) ended up shoving me and one of the girls next to me completely out of our spot by the last five minutes of the concert, and when I asked her to move she fake-apologized and shoved again. What an asshole. My only saving grace was the friends I had made in line who anchored me mostly in place haha. B1A4 did toss towels into the crowd though and everyone was pretty well-behaved for that. 

Baro did most of the ments since his English is clearly the best of the bunch, and there was a translator for some members, but overall you could tell the boys were all trying really hard to communicate with us. Since the venue was so small the fanservice was insane -- I must've gotten at *least* eye contact with most members, but a lot of pointing/waving occurred as well. At one point Jinyoung was kind of making fun of me during one of Baro's ments -- I laughed and put my hand up to my mouth, he did the same thing. I put my hand down, then he mirrored me. I smiled and he smiled, so then I waved and he waved back. It was insane. Out of all the members I think he was the most interactive with my section overall, with Baro being next -- Baro made a lot of eye contact, but Jinyoung always smiled back, sometimes a little awkwardly if he caught your eye quick like the way a white person smiles when you run into them on the street and say hello. It was the fuckin funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. It was also cute because the audience reacted a lot before the translator finished translating, and they always looked surprised haha. 

And here's where I talk about hi-touch! God, sorry this was so long, I weirdly remembered this in hyperrealism so I kind of went for it. But here goes: 

There was an announcement for VIP to all stay in the venue while everyone left, so we did. Weirdly enough I don't think anyone checked our wristbands or anything, or at least I can't recall if they did, but after everyone left they herded us into one long line snaking around the room. B1A4 came out fairly quickly (CNU was still in his tank top, I thought I was going to die) and the line started to go. I purposefully was near the end so it was still a little bit before we could see them, but the line went by really fast since Powerhouse staff were really rushing people along. For the first few minutes it looked like it was just high-fives going down the line and I panicked because I wanted a little more time with them to say hello. Either way, I was soaked and looked like a mess so I really quickly brushed my hair while I was in line lol. 

While we were waiting, the staff kept going through the line telling us that our bags HAD to be on our left sides and that our phones HAD to be put away, so I acquiesced. Having to deal with a camera would've stressed me out too much anyways; that's why I rarely record at concerts. 

By the time I got to the front, the line had slowed down even though Powerhouse was still pushing us along. The staff were shouting ""NO HANDSHAKES! ONLY HIGH-FIVES"" but each member shook the hands of every single one of us. That gave us some time to say things, thank Christ.

Baro was first, and he started off with ""thanks for coming"" or something along those lines. When he took my hand to shake it I said, ""God, I can't believe you're real."" He looked me straight in the eye and said, ""I am."" 

Next was Jinyoung. He said ""thank you,"" so then I panicked a little bit and just said, ""You're amazing."" Fuck. He's so cute. 

After that I shook hands with Gongchan, who also thanked me for being there, and I just kind of blurted out real quick, ""You're beautiful."" He looked kind of confused but he smiled, so I hoped he got my gist haha. At this point Powerhouse staff was starting to rush me through a *lot*, I think I was taking a little too long. 

Next was my bias, Sandeul. I had a lot I wanted to say to him but I couldn't remember it, so after he thanked me, I told him, very sincerely, ""You're the best singer ever."" I hoped he knew that I really truly and sincerely meant it! I think he has one of the best male voices in kpop, if not the best. 

Last was CNU. This is where I really and truly panicked. After his ""thank you,"" I didn't know what to say. He was in his tank top and his hair looked amazing and his arms did too and I kind of went, ""Ahhhh thank you so much!"" Oof. Mess. I got herded out by staff after that and it was all kind of a blur but at least I do remember what I said and mostly how they reacted! 

All in all, B1A4 were all so sweet and it was really nice of them to give us all handshakes and thank us all individually. Up close they're so beautiful, like I know they're not considered the most good-looking boy group out there but they're so cute. They're also really approachable: I didn't feel intimidated by them or anything, they kept it really friendly and kind. Experiencing them live, and in the VIP section with hi-touch, was just a dream come true. 

Anyways, I'm so sorry this turned out so long (it's a fuckin' essay, lord) but I had such a great time that I wanted to share it with everyone. I know B1A4 isn't a really popular group on this sub or even in America, but the turnout to the concert was great and everyone, including the boys, were all really into it and clearly having fun. They're a great group live, their singing and dancing is on point, and the fans are mostly uber-sweet. I'm so glad that I was able to go and I highly encourage anyone who has the chance to see B1A4 in the future to check them out! It personally meant a lot to me to be able to see a group whose music helped me through some of my worst depressive episodes.",4,42

It has a beautiful meaning of fans who light to Minzy, and people who listen to the music of light.
