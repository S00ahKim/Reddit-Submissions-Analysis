Ill start. I became a fan of CLC during Hobgoblin, loved all their past releases and everything theyve done since (excluding To the Sky). However, Yeeun has always been my bias with Youngi/Elkie being biaswreckers. However, I NEVER got the hype for Sorn. I literally could not understand it. Even during No Sorn was just meh. But then I watched the live stage for [Like It](https://youtu.be/cVnyq8Yz0Bc) and I am a changed person. Holy shit. Sorns incredible. Her visuals, vocals, dance literally top notch. Ive rewatched Black Dress and I cant stop admiring Sorn. Honestly not sure what was wrong with me before lmao. 

Another example is Minhyun from Wanna One. He always seemed overrated until Light came out and his vocals? his elegance? Top notch. Beyond incredible. ",51,1,False,self,,,,,

While their debut didn't give them nearly as much attention as I believe they deserve, it's definitely a platform that could be expanded easily.

The first step for this growth, in my eyes, is replacing their stylist(s), or at the very least educating them on how to properly make a tomboy concept fit within a group.

Many k-pop fanatics will agree that Amber Liu is the very best example of a tomboy concept gone right. F(x)'s stylists knew how to properly style the group as a whole so that Amber fit in with the other members. This was done by not basing outfits on a specific shirt or dress, but on a specific color or pattern (ex. plaid in rum pum pum pum, or muted pastel colors and striped patterns for 4 walls).

GWSN's stylist, though, does the opposite, and it brings all of your attention to Miya in the wrong way. For one of the group's debut stages, her members were all wearing the same outfit, all in the same white skirt and the exact same white blouse, while Miya wore white jeans and a straight-jacket-esque top that was both too complex and just plain unnecessary. To better execute this, in my opinion, the stylist should have put her in longer white shorts and a ""masculinized"" version of the other member's blouse.

I should really say, though, that I don't know much at all about fashion. This is just something that I noticed a while ago which has bothered me ever since.

TL;DR - GWSN's stylist isn't as good as F(x)'s.

I would love dreampop and/or surf rock to be a major trend for at least four or five months, especially attempted by bands or girl groups. Seeing as how they've already released a dreampop-like track, I think LOONA OEC would excel in the sound, and a band like Day6 would also probably execute surf rock well. I also want a ""rock-hop"" type sound (think Post Malone, or Sik-K's latest track Fire) to be a big thing in the KHH world. iKon would definitely pull it off well with their rappers and vocalists.

If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

Monthly Note: Yay, using Hanteo again!  As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

Also, I am doing a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

Feel free to say whatever praise or criticism you have of the song! Along side your review, please give the song a score between 1 and 10  1 this song would not be a song you would uncover, 10 being this is a song you'd request all night! If a song an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you can also have the MV be a part of your overall review as well  totally optional though, if you want to just use the song to inform your review then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do feel free to [check out the very first Jukebox thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/).

Song reviews are open up until this Saturday at 11:59 PM PST. I normally would say by Friday at 11:59 PM PST, but I will let you know in advance that I'm not going to get to posting Jukebox by Saturday afternoon and will be posting next week's thread on Sunday instead.

This has been a hot topic lately but no major outlets have been talking about it. The only source that has spoken about it was AllKpop and they only did the bare minimum in reporting about it with no names only using 'A' and 'B'.

ATEEN has posted on their instagram that they hope justice will be served and to help them. They posted this 4 days ago.

People on Twitter are trying to get hashtags trending to bring awareness to the subject at hand. #JusticeForATEEN and #WeSupportYouATEEN are the hashtags to use.

There's supposedly going to announce something in less than 30 hours, which I'm guessing it's that.

So life has been a bit busy so I haven't have time to write up a fan account about the San Jose stop for MXM 1st Live &amp; Meet US Tour.

For those interested in the setlist, please click [here.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxP4VzvUwAA0ECl.jpg:large)

So for this event, it was hosted by Studio PAV, and this is my first show that I've attended that has been hosted by them.

Also, to preference this account, I obtained the VIP tier ticket, which included a fansign and other additional perks (which I'll get to later).

For future newbies, here are a few things you need to know:

* You are not able to print tickets after purchase. Instead, you **NEED** to save your confirmation number that is included in your receipt email. That is because the staff has a list where they use confirmation numbers to check you present and give you your VIP stuff.
* Check your emails if you are VIP, as Studio PAV emails a list of all VIPs in order of purchase time - which determines where you are in line for the fansign group photo, and when you can enter the venue.
* Seats are pseudo first come, first serve. I say pseudo because all though there were no assigned seats, they left people into the auditorium in blocks of 10-15, in number order (which is based on when you purchased tickets). So for example, if you're #11, you're been in either the first cluster or second that gets let into the auditorium.
* If you preordered merch prior to the show, they give everything to you when you check in.
* Read the final email sent a day or so prior to the show's date and follow it to the T. They were very strict about check-in times and your place in line.
* The order of events for VIPs went as following: Fansign-group photo-show-""snapshot"" (i.e. solo photo with one member) photo session.

So without further ado, let's get this review on the road!

**Pre-Show Events (Check-In, Fansign, and Group Photo):**

So the first thing I did was check in around 4PM, as the window for VIPs to check in to keep your spot in line was from 4PM to 5PM. I got to the venue around 30 minutes before 4, but went and got food (upside, the Montgomery Theater is right in the middle of downtown - so tons of food options).

The way the staff split us us was in three lines right outside the venue: #1-50, #51-100, and #100-156. The problem with this though was if you didn't check your email to know where you were in line, you had to wait until things calmed down before asking a staff for help.

Anyway, once we were in line, staff came with their lists and checked each of us in with our confirmation numbers, and gave us VIP landyards with both our number and names (written in Korean) for us to wear for the pre-show events.

Once everyone was checked in, they let us enter the courtyard of the venue right outside the doors in number order, as the fansign was scheduled to take place at 5PM in the lobby.

This is where things got dicey. Something behind the scenes happened that caused MXM to be late in starting the VIP pre-show events. While it was supposed to start at 5PM, things really didn't start rolling until about 6:30PM.

So due to this delay, the fansign went very quickly, as they still had to start the show around 7PM. So pretty much, the fansign went as follows:

* A staff member handed us an unsealed album right before our turn to meet the members. And for those wondering, the albums are C1s. The album we were given was their first album *More Than Ever,* and had both versions available - though we couldn't pick which version we wanted signed.
* The member order for the fansign was Youngmin and Donghyun. Due to the having to get through things fast, they quickly signed the album on the cover (with Youngmin being the one to add ""To: \[Name\]"").
*  You do have a bit of time to talk to them though, as I think I had about 2-3 minutes to talk to both of them.
* Youngmin and Donghyun do speak basic conversational English, but due to the quick nature of the fansign, speaking conversational Korean is just as good if you know enough if you want to practice with them.
* For me, I had enough time (all in Korean) to introduce myself, let them know I watched them on Broduce, told them I was studying Korean for 5 months, asked Donghyun if they had eaten In-N-Out, and told them it's my favorite burger once he said they did and it was delicious.
* Youngmin was very surprised when I busted out my Korean, so I'm guessing that the majority of their international fans they saw across their tour likely didn't know Korean.
* They laughed when I asked them about In-N-Out since it was such a random question and not something typically fanboy/fangirly.

On a side note, definitely noticed that there were very few Koreans at the show in VIP land. Don't know if the lack of fansite masters was due to the tour overlapping with WO ending or what, but I was shocked by handful of Koreans at the show - they were definitely outnumbered by international fans.

Also, it could be because Studio PAV was very strict about cameras. They had 2-3 bag checks and had a no tolerance policy about getting caught live-streaming, recording, and taking photos with DSLR cameras.

Anyway, next thing was the group photos. So due to having to clear up the fansign area to use the backdrop for the photos, everyone had to ""loop"" back out of the building once we got our signed cds in order to re-enter the building.

Photos were done in groups of 10-15, based on your place in line. I didn't do the photo since it's not really my thing, but those who did it seemed to enjoy it. After the photo is done, we were allowed into the venue were seating was a free for all.

I got about 6th row in the center section, which was nice since I was in the 90s for VIP.

So now onto the show!

**Show Review:**

So the show ran for about 2 hours, and the venue was very good for fans because it felt very intimate (due to having 468 seats). Positive note is that it definitely looked like it sold out.

Also, funnily enough due to the lack of Korean fans, there was essentially no fanchants throughout the show except fr one or two songs, but lightsticks were in abundance due to Studio PAV being cool and actually selling them both online and on-site - a rarity since lightsticks are rarely offered for Western fans for K-Pop concerts.

So main thing to note is that during the ments, that was a ""Q&amp;A"" time where MXM answered fan questions and in one instance, the their manager giving away free signed merch to audience members. The ments were a mix of English and Korean, with an on-stage translator announcing things in English when MXM would switch over to Korean.

In terms overall review, I really became a bigger fan of MXM after seeing them live. Their blend of mixing hip-hop/R&amp;B with a pop twist is super interesting and seems to definitely be what Brand New is wanting to do with Brand new Boys.

Youngmin was the main rapper, but also shared a lot of vocals with Donghyun. There was also about 3-4 backup dancers, and the boys had about 3 costume changes. Another cool thing is that they had the appropriate music videos running in the background when the boys were performing.

Each boy also had sizable solo stages too! Youngmin went first with a dance solo stage. His stage was the same he did at the duo's Korean concert in September. The songs he danced to was a medley of:

* NBDY - Used To (prod. JNTHN)
* Desiigner- Panda (Prod. By: Menace)
* Jay Park - YACHT

Donhyun, meanwhile, had a solo vocal stage, performing an acoustic version of his solo song ""[Serenade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gww5pUAuY0A)"".

Just a minor quibble, but seeing the group live definitely shows that BNB needs a main vocalist. Donghyun's range isn't bad, but he definitely struggled a bit to hit some of the higher notes in the later songs, being a bit flat at times.

Also bummed that we didn't get YDPP's ""Love It Live It"" - I knew it was a long shot, but I had hoped...

In any case, a nice throwback was right before the encore started, there was a VCR that showed their history/progression from the Broduce days to the tour. It was super sweet and a nice memory lane for fans.

**Post-Show Activities (Snapshot sessions):**

I did not participate in this due to this not being my thing, but those who like this kind of thing should know that this is an additional fee and not included in the normal VIP package.

**Overall Thoughts:**

Overall, I'd say the boys definitely did their part in hyping up BNB for 2019. They definitely impressed, and it's been great seeing them grow into their own as artists from their beginnings on Broduce to now.

Plus, the ments were chock full of info super fans find cute, but didn't overstay their welcome. While things were delayed in the beginning, Studio PAV definitely had their shit together in making sure things ran smoothly so things could end on time.

I'm actually going to miss MXM, though I'm definitely excited to see different sides of the boys when they are in BNB.

Overall, I'd give the show a **9.5/10.**

 I used to hope I could be an idol but not anymore because...... 

1) I'm too old

2) After watching the unit, I was worried what if I became part of a group that wouldn't be popular/make money/have a ceo involved in a scandal and would just ghost the company

3) Have to quit/put on hold my academics.....okay if I'm going to be successful but can be a problem if I have to go back kinda late..( I know it's never to late, but it can still be a hassle in some way) HOW LONG CAN ONE BE AN IDOL?

4) I had to carefully evaluate WHY I really wanted to be an idol was I....

really passionate about music to the extent that i was willing to move to another country,learn a new language, conform to the beauty standards of the industry?? Or was I just super obsessed with my fave groups that i would die just to get a chance to be their friends??? 

Did I have some musical ability/skill that I could develop? Am I musically inclined? Or was I just excited about the fact that hey being an idol has perks...you get fans and can be popular

&amp;#x200B;

and then i read the downs of the industry.... call me butt hurt but/negative as you get older you start to get more realistic especially when you start working towards your dream and you realize...man this is harder than I thought...is it really worth it????? It is if your passionate about music but make sure you really know the reason why you want to pursue something.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. I hope there's some truth to what I said...hopefully someone will agree. :)

Similarly, it was often said that Dara's main purpose was to be the conventionally pretty member of 2NE1.

I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check.

I, who have been a chinese kpop fan for about 2 years, find that the some chinese idols that debut in Korea are now spending less time attending the events of Korean groups. Instead they mostly come back to China to act in chinese drama or debut in China as a solo singer. Gradually they even dont attend group comeback and promote the new title song with group members. I don't know it's by their will or it's just the managers asks them to do so. 

No offense towards these hard-working idols and their fans. I'm aware of these idols because i'm a chinese. And im not sure if these situations occur to japanese lines and thai lines.

In my opinion I don't care where they are from but they should be aware of why they debut in korea first and realize they are k-pop artists. And they should put the group in the first place and attend group events as long as they dont terminate the contract agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***We especially requested you to be interviewed out of Red Velvet. Why do you think we chose you?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*I dont know. Maybe it was because Im popular among women but its GQ*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Maybe it was because of your coolness. You dont look fussy, anxious nor easily swept away by things.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*I value doing my end of the work as well as I can a lot. I think there are people who notice that I think a lot about what my role is, what Im good at and what Im trying to express the most out of this job.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***If that were true, wed simply say you were hard-working.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*People might have found some charms that I havent discovered about myself. But I personally look up to people who do theirpart of the job the best they can. And thats the kind of person I think of when other people tell me that Im cool.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Whos the coolest person to you out of all the people in the world?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Mom and dad. When I said that I wanted to be a singer when I was young, they supported me with everything they could. They even signed up for auditions in my place. On top of that, they even packed lunch boxes and fed them to me whenever I finished practicing and went back home. I spent my seven years as a trainee like that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***It looks like they took care of you like a sports star.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Yeah, at first I thought my parents were being too extra, because I thought I was all grown up. I even worried that I might not be able to survive on my own if they kept doing things like that to me. But, even these days, when I tell them that Im stressed over my singing, they talk to me like a vocal coach. Nowadays, they trust me and leave me alone. They just say that they hope I come back to them whenever I feel down.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***What has changed the most about you while being a part of Red Velvet?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*I really think Im changing constantly. I can feel that I change depending on what kind of mindset I have at that moment. A lot of things cross my mind because of that. These days, I dont know what kind of person I am. But then again, Im sure everybodys like this. Sometimes, Im confident to do something, but other times, even if the littlest thing goes wrong, I lose confidence and look timid. Then I figure out whats wrong with me and get better. Stuff like these just all exist inside of me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***The fact that your job requires you to present every aspect of yourself to the public is what makes it harder, isnt it?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Yeah. But thats also how I get energized.'*  
&gt;  
&gt;***During your trainee years, did you learn how to get interviewed?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*No. Before, I took a look at the questions ahead of time and wrote all of my answers below it, in fear that I might forget them. But these days, I think Im able to speak without going through all of that because I think about these things casually. If, when I first debuted, I censored myself to say typical things in case it could cause controversy, nowadays, I find out what Ive been thinking about these days while getting interviewed. I like interviews like these because theyre like short logs of my life. Before, I did hide myself a lot. I mean, I still have some sides of me that I havent revealed. I think that Ill look pretty doing this, but then again, I realize, I dont look pretty when I smile. Things like that. I know I have things that Im still hiding right now, but Im planning onto not put too much effort in covering them up. Im learning how to show those things naturally.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***You look comfortable being interviewed. Is there anything that people dontknow about you well despite your efforts to not cover yourself up?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Um If I were to list one thing, Im not as hard-working as people think I am. Im the kind of person who gets things done, even if it means I have to rush through it. But, the thing is that it takes me a long time to summon the energy to motivate myself to get that done Really, Im not the kind of person who plans everything out in advance.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***But I heard that you make sure to do everything the best you can, whether its a variety show or a special stage.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*I try to do whatever it takes to make that happen. Even if that means I have to stay up all night. But that doesnt mean that Im hard-working.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Maybe its because youre known for being a trainee for a long time.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Lots of people take pity on me by saying things like,Oh, how did you go through all that,That must have been rough, but I wish they wouldnt. I, myself, dont think it was that much of a hard time. Of course, there were some rough patches, but its like how someone whos been a trainee for three years has their own three years of hardship and trouble. Lets say someone whos been a trainee for three years debuts with me. Then that means that that person has to get used to working with me, a person who has trained for seven years. That, in other words, means that that person had to condense what I had to go through seven years and get it done in three years. Everybody has their own pace and time. If I had really debuted after just three years of practice, I would have been more lost than I am now.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***You once said that you were having a hard time keeping up with the busy schedules. How do you manage to keep calm and get things done when you have tons of things to do?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*I just say to myself that this is my job. Actually, thats something that I always have in mind. I push through by thinking that I cant let go of this for the people around me, like my fans and the staff. And it feels really good when people notice what Ive worked on. I became a singer for people to notice my hard work and also because I enjoy getting my hard work being noticed.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Is there a habit you have kept without fail ever since youve debuted?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Hmm Ah! I tried to make the people who know me like me! My personality is like that. Even when I was young, I had a good relationship with my classmates too. People who dont know me could not like me. But Ive always told myself to try to leave a good impression of myself in the people who do know me. I dont like being on bad terms with people. Im more of a people person. If theres someone whos talking bad about me, I want to listen to what that person has to say too, and ask,Why dont you like me? (Giggles)*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Do you have anything that youve learned to let go after debuting?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*My looks? Of course, I think that everybody has their own characteristics and charms. But you know the generic kind of beauty that people have, right? Im trying to not think too much about that. Im trying not to focus too much on pretty things.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Wait, what? Im getting more and more surprised because the more I look at you, the more you resemble the actress Lee Young-Ae.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*My looks are constantly exposed to the public because of my job, so if I didnt have that kind of mindset, Im sure I would have been really stressed. But, its the era of individuality now. If theres one thing that Im confident in my looks, its the locations of my ears, eyes, mouth, and nose! When I debuted, I got lots of hate comments and got called out for my looks, which made my self-esteem plummet. But Ive let go of all of that. In theLaws of the Jungle, I was just like,Here goes nothing, and revealed my no-makeup face in front of the camera. I find people who are honest about themselves cool and pretty. And they look much more charming when theyre like that. Its way cooler to see people notblindly follow other people.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***If theres one ability that you really need right now, what would it be?****Being able to say what I want right away.****You cant?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*No. I wish I could just say whats in my head well. From a long time ago, I thought I was a bit boring. I like chatting quietly like this, but I think that makes me look shabby compared to the other bright people in the music industry. I also feel like I ruin everything because Im not good at telling stories well. It got to the point where I was convinced that I had a talent for making everything awkward. So, I want to say what I want right away, without hesitation. Im wondering about whether drinking will help me get over this problem, because when Im drinking with other people, that bright and relaxed atmosphere helps me be more honest.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***If you could steal someones abilities, whose would you steal?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Beyonces. Wow, I wonder what she feels like being able to dance and sing like that. She must feel really happy being the best at everything*  
&gt;  
&gt;***In a past interview, you said that you wanted to learn how to play the guitar. Have you made any progress on that?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*This proves why Im not hard-working. (Giggles) You see, if I make a plan, it becomes a long-term plan no matter what, because there isnt a date that I have to accomplish it by.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***It might be risky for you to make any plans without setting an urgent deadline.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Yeah, I think so. Then again, even when I was young, I always crammed for my exams, but I have a reason for that. I only had one week to study for my exams while being a trainee. Instead of going to the company for that week, Id get tutored and study till dawn. Ive gotten too used to that now, so, if I have something that I need to do, I set a deadline and make sure it gets done by then.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Then what are some of the extra long-term goals you have as being a part of Red Velvet?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Red Velvet is a group that tries out a variety of concepts, right? I mean, its gotten to the point where I cant figure out what to wear when I have to performPeek-A-Boo andPower Up in one performance. But concentrating on every moment of that is really fun. When else would I be able to dance intimidatingly and make those kinds of facial expressions if it wasnt forBad Boy? I think Red Velvet is a group where unique people have come together to sing unique songs and express uniqueness. I dont like cliche things, so I like the direction that the company is leading Red Velvet to. Although now Im only able to pitch in a few opinions while performing at concerts, I hope that in the future Ill be able to participate more in building the direction that Red Velvet will take, since weve been in the industry for quite some time and were starting to understand what our color is like.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Could you share a super short-term goal that youve achieved recently?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*I think Im just winding down by eating yummy things these days. Before, I didnt have the luxury of being able to try yummy things or food. But now its different. I have to eat want I immediately. So I ate gopchang yesterday.*",36,1,False,self,,,,,

So it was bound to happen sooner or later that I'd make a list for k-pop. This is what I came up with.

Ranking:

A - Know all/most of their names, listen to/buy their music frequently, watch behind the scene videos to learn more about them often. Invested! 

B - Know a few of their names, listen to/buy their music sometimes, watched a few behind the scenes because I was curious about them. Interested, but not crazy about them.

C - Know no one's names, listen to/buy their music rarely, have watched hardly any behind the scenes. Don't really care.

BTS - A
Seventeen - A
Astro - A
EXO - B
The Rose - A
Day6 - A
Pentagon - B
NU'EST W - B
Infinite -C
VIXX - C
Got7 - B
Monsta X - A

My predictions: 

**CL**: CL's current contract with YG should expire in Q2 (April-June) this year, and I think she will be leaving YG for sure. Last year, she made it *very* obvious that she was not happy with YG and wanted out. She leaked her unreleased music video for her English single ""All In"" on New Year's Day and called out YG and Yang Hyun Suk throughout the year for blocking her album from releasing and ignoring her. The real question is where she will move to. After Psy founded his agency and signed Jessi, Hyuna, and Edawn, many fans have been begging him to sign CL after she leaves YG. I think this would be a good move for both. Psy seems to be focusing on artists known for strong charisma and performance, and CL certainly fits that quality. They are also both familiar with each other from their mutual time at YG, and they are both signed to Scoot Braun for their American management. CL has also made many connections in the U.S., which I think would be very valuable to Psy's agency. She even convinced the director for WINNER's ""Really Really"" to work with them after he initially said no. However, I could see CL foregoing signing to a new Korean agency and focusing exclusively on her American album.

**Dara**: Dara's current contract with YG should also expire in Q2. I'm split on whether she will re-sign or leave. Dara has been doing very well lately and landed a fixed MC position on Video Star. However, she has said several times that she really wants to release music and perform on stage again and has even publicly asked YG to let her release music. YG already struggles to give their current lineup of groups enough releases, and are also about to debut two new boys groups, so the chances of Dara getting to release any music are near zero. Although she has been doing well in her career as a variety star, I don't think YG is giving Dara anything that another company couldn't also give her while giving her more. If Dara moved to another company, she could continue to grow her career as a variety star while also occasionally releasing a mini-album and hosting a fan meeting. Plus, I think that YG may have permanently broken Dara's trust when they disbanded 2NE1. Dara, Bom, and CL all re-signed with YG under the impression that 2NE1 would continue with the three of them. They worked all summer on a new album, which CL halted her U.S. activities to return to Korea to work on, and then YG cancelled the album, terminated Bom's contract, and disbanded the group. They were all devastated, but I think Dara especially felt betrayed as she cherished 2NE1 more than anyone else. Despite that, Dara's career has been doing very well while she's been with YG, so well that she is [number 5 on the top 10 list of richest idols](https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/990041/these-are-the-richest-idols-in-k-pop-right-now#photo-959482). I think Dara could get more of what she wants if she left YG, but I'm not sure if she will want to risk such a big change when she's doing so well. ",94,1,False,self,,,,,

I just imagine and fantasize man, ""What if I was an idol? IT WOULD BE SO COOL.""  But this imagining would get to the point wherein I'm happy to be a fan of them, but unhappy with myself. I ge so jealous of these poeple D: 

&amp;#x200B;

I watched one kpop concert in my life and I seriously great sadness after it ended cause I felt alone? I know it's odd, but seriously, I had this concert high then when it ended I felt like a nobody compared to these celebrities that were so loved and they are fulfilling their dream while I'm just a regular nobody. I keep on trying to get back to reality and try not to make myself feel jealous by thinking about the downs of the industry.... which is bad too cause it just shows I'm bitter, but I definitely need to balance things again I can't continue putting myself down to this point. I want to prioritize/value myself as well and love my life I still wanna be a fan, but I just want a happy medium. Honestly, when I watched videos titled ""Why I'm not a fan anymore"" I was one of those people who were like ""what?"" ""boo you're boring"" and ""that sucks"" but now I can honestly understand what they meant when the industry can be toxic (specifically with issues that leaked about how trainees/idols make fun of fans, managers being rude to even the fans that act accordingly at events, idols taking part in racist/cultural jokes)  sometimes their fangirling got to the point wherein they lost focus in other aspects of their life. We found ourselves making excuses for the idols too. But I know that not everyone in the industry is like that just like everywhere else there are ups and downs.

So this post is mainly K-Pop but I think my story would be more interesting if I talk about my own history with music albums. I am the Joy of my family (was the youngest until my sister was born two and a half years after me...oh yeah, Im a guy for that matter, haha. The Joy was just a reference lol). Anyways, I was the last person in my family to have an album. The first album I ever bought was a Crow Movie Soundtrack Album for my older brother. My dads got old albums and my mom has her old American boy band album (98 Degrees for those who were interested). My brothers got The Crow and U2s HTDAAB.

My sister and I are the biggest fans of K-Pop. Her first album she bought (along with my parents money of course) was Blackpinks Square Up. Next was BTS Love Yourself (which I paid for since she didnt have enough and I had to assist...I went broke after that, haha). Next was EXOs DMUMT (she paid for that). Last was ONEUS.

As for me, I received my first album last June (which was my birth month). It was The All American Rejects Move Along, for that matter (since its nostalgic for me). My first K-Pop album happened to have came on the most recent Christmas. My favorite group is SHINee and my favorite album was the Hello repackage. My sister bought it for me on Christmas! It was so cool! THE first album I ever bought for myself came last month though. My sister and I were at our K-Pop store when we saw the last RBB album. Im a big Reveluv but wanted to save my money. My sister wanted me to get it (since I never bought an album for myself and it came with a nice giant poster). In the end, I gave in and bought it (but got broke...again). So it was Red Velvets RBB that was the first album I ever bought for myself. ...by the way, I didnt get my bias photo card for that matter. In total, I have three albums:

AAR - Move Along (American 2000s Emo/Alternative)

SHINee - Hello (K-Pop)

Red Velvet - RBB (K-Pop)

Im thinking about getting the upcoming Taemin Want album too since Ive saved my money the past month. In the same time, I can afford a light stick but I really dont know. Whats everyones first albums though? And their collection?",85,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently been on the hunt for a song that I believe is close to K-Pop and was hoping someone had any info on it at all. Like the title of the post says the song was something along the line of Angel (Xmas) or Angel (Merry Xmas). I never really considered to sound too much long a christmas song at at so im not really sure, but it could be me not understanding the translation. I remember listening to this song around 2000-2004, so its quite old at this point. I really hope im on the right sub and its even considered K-pop, but i dont know where else to turn. Thanks everyone",4,1,False,self,,,,,

For me this occurred way back maybe in 2010. Being too lazy to type in Youtubes full url on google, I just typed in Y in the search bar, knowing the first suggestion would be the Youtube site.

However, instead of actually recommending me the site itself, Google recommended me [MBLAQs Y](https://youtu.be/uIlbl9Vf4y4) because I googled Y in the search bar. 

I ended up watching the whole video (mainly because I thought they said Im black instead of *MBLAQ* in the beginning) and I really liked the intense sequence of the video. I added the song to my ipod playlist, but I didnt officially become a Kpop fan until 3 years later, when I discovered SNSDs I Got A Boy.

The girl group Favorite which I have not heard about until today has this [fantastic sounding song!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4nZjrXc1BQ)

here's another link for the [instrumental track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03vhva5tnr8)

Now, here's the issue is, I found [this instrumental](https://clyp.it/elatxta4) OVER ONE YEAR AGO. It was posted to a youtube channel that was under the name O Z Production (and other titles) and is now called [GO35Beatz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-78TWr3nz_rAxpm9WPHMA) and this channel has 5 subscribers at the time that I am posting this. F I V E, myself included. The track that this person uploaded, I downloaded for my own listening pleasures and because I like to write lyrics. As many other song writers can attest to, you have beats with lyrics that you save that are years and years old because you either never finished it or never got around to doing anything more with it.

How can I go about finding out if the song is plagiarized or not? As someone who likes to work with music even in the slightest as a hobby, I find it hard to believe that a youtube channel with 5 subscribers that has never advertised his beats for sale or lease has the exact same sound as a Kpop track by coincidence. This guy has never responded to any youtube comments, and has never had any website or contact information for selling his craft.",13,1,False,self,,,,,

However, have you ever been able to change a skeptical friend's mind with a certain K-Pop song or artist? What eventually caused their change of heart?

My older sister listens to very political hardcore punk rock, but I somehow got her obsessed with ""Move"" by Taemin.

Hopefully enough redditors will be willing to participate so that I can continue this game.

&amp;#x200B;

Inspired by the show ""Produce 101"", I have chosen 101 female idols from groups that debut in 2017/2018. Just like the show, the /r/kpop community will decide who among the 101 that can make it to the final 11. From 101, it will be cut down to 60, 35, 20 and then the final 11.

&amp;#x200B;

There will be weekly voting, and just like the show, I will reveal each week's rankings for the idols remaining. After every elimination, there will be a vote reset. Just like the show, I will also introduce the different ""evaluation"" rounds, with the winners getting benefit votes. I will explain in more detail when these ""evaluation"" rounds happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Each weekly voting will enable each redditor to vote up to 7 times. And each round, each redditor will also need to vote a certain number of idols for the vote to be counted. For this first round, there will be 3 weekly voting and you are to choose 11 out of the 101 idols to vote for. You are allowed to choose different combination of idols when you vote each time.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the idol groups I have selected the 101 idols from.

For me, with dancers these three things are equally important: are they expressing the lyrics and telling a story as they dance? Are they dancing to the beat/rhythm of the song and the lyrics well? Are they matching the energy of the song well (i.e. dancing slow to a SLOW song)? 

Chances are if a dancer pays attention to all three of those things, they will dance pretty well, period. 

For singers, I like seeing them sing in their natural register so their vibrato is resonant and pretty I like seeing singers that are comfortable in their PERSONAL range and not trying to sing like anyone else. Of course you can take pointers and tips on technique!!!! But there is only one Beyonce and only one Jojo! If people sing in in their natural register, they will have more flexibility(?) with what they can do with their voice. Who knows, you could even be better than Beyonce and Jojo if you just sing as yourself and no one else.

Another turn off is people who ""throw"" their voice, which wouldnt be an issue in the first place if they sang in their natural register. I like seeing singers that realize singing from their diaphragm ISNT singing while flexing their abs and throwing their voice in hopes they hit the note. Thats how you ruin your voice.

What about you guys?",40,1,False,self,,,,,

It's through Dreamcatcher's new movie The End of Nightmare.
 
Dreamcatcher's ""Nightmare"" started on January 13, 2017. The nightmare they unfolded has gradually evolved. It has captured the whole world by repeatedly changing to the prequel and the modern. It is no exaggeration to say that the achievement of only one dreamcatcher who finished two world tours beyond Korea was successful in 'nightmare' concept.

In his first film [The Nightmare], Dreamcatcher disassembled himself into a nightmare. 'Dreams that are being pursued by someone: Jiu', 'dreams that someone is looking at: Han Dong', 'Dreams confined in a narrow space: Siyeon', 'dreams falling from a high place: Gahyeon, 'Dreams of wandering in a strange place: Yoohyeon', 'Damaged dreams: Dami'. This was a joke of Dreamcatcher.
 
These stories led to [Fall asleep in the mirror]. Dreamcatcher's mischievous mischief evokes the nightmare of a nightmare hunter, and a chase with seven nightmares is unfolding. The invitation from the nightmare hunter, the runaway, and the captivated nightmare, and the mortal chase to rescue them, have reversed the battle and all the time.

There was a mystery that could not be solved in the story of 'Nightmare' that followed. How is a girl become a nightmare? In their first mini-album [Prequel], they released the answer to the question, which Dreamcatcher appropriated to the taste of InSomnia around the world through the causal process of the ""nightmare"" epic.
 
And a new 'nightmare' unfurled. Dreamcatcher's ""Nightmare"" did not stay in one era. In the [Nightmare Escape the ERA], it ended the antique era that they have shown while continuing the unique nightmare fantasy story. The ambiguous boundaries of reality and dreams, as well as one of inner and outer, seem to be both charming stories have established a certain identity of Dreamcatcher.

And in [Alone In The City], Dreamcatcher extended the story by defining the reason of 'nightmare' as modern stress. The unstable reality of the youth of the real world, and everything that plagues herself, represents the dream that is recreated in nightmares and the conflict between the 'seven nightmares', making Dreamcatcher's story more appealing.
 
This never-ending narrative of dreamcatcher finally reaches its end in The End of Nightmare. [The End of Nightmare] is a work that makes up the story of Dreamcatcher's ""Nightmare"" so far.

DreamCatcher's ending is also quite different from the usual imagination. Just like the dreamcatcher who follows the nightmare from the beginning and melts the 'nightmare' to the 'shock of the reversal', it keeps you in the endless nightmare. In other words, [The End of Nightmare] is the 'da capo' in the fantasy, which is the end of Dreamcatcher's 'Nightmare' and a new beginning.
 
What is Dreamcatcher's ""Nightmare Fine""? With Dreamcatcher's 'PIRI', I invite you into an endless nightmare.

1. **Intro**: Intro track that combines the early orchestration reminiscent of a scene in a war movie and the intense Drum &amp; Bass rhythm of the latter part. The sound that suggests the  title 'PIRI' adds to the expectation.

2. **PIRI**: Dream Catcher's new song 'PIRI' is a song that expresses the feelings of modern people who want to escape the loneliness and anxiety left alone. They expressed their SOS signal through the material called ""flute"" in the lyrics. If there is a new change, it is a feeling of urgency with a different feeling beat from the existing fast tempo activity songs. Especially, the melody line that repeats with the flute catching the ear and the whistling sound is the point of appreciation.
3. **Diamond**: It is a song with aspirations that do not break like the strongest jewel ""diamond"" and endeavor to overcome the nightmare threat. The intense bit in the chorus expresses their hardness. Dream Catcher's new Future Rock genre.
4. **And there was no one**.:It is a retro pop genre song, featuring the prologue story of the title song 'PIRI'. I expressed the lonely and hollow emotions in the lyrics with a simple rhythm and other themes.
5. **Daydream()**: Waiting for an appointment with someone, but all the memories are just imaginary, futile fantasies. A ballad that stands out from the untold heart and nostalgia.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Big thanks to the subbers, especially WNB SUBS who covered Episode 7 until the end

Instead of writing the dates each episode was released in the table, I put the date I believe each was recorded. Some dates are unknown so I just put general time frames.

Since anyone who hasn't been keeping up with Okay Wanna One might be overwhelmed by the number of episodes, below this table is another table of the best scenes and clips (chosen by me and users in the Wanna One Discord). Feel free to mention any other clips you'd like included because there are plenty more great clips!

Tbh , i was hesitating about posting this since it may be a sensitive topic to some. Just a disclaimer that I'm not hating on any community, I'm just afraid that Yeri or any of the RV girls would get into any sort of trouble especially if it's as an unwitting party.

The LA Part of Red Velvet's Redmare US tour just finished. During the closing talks of the first day, a flag representing pride for the LGBT community was thrown on stage from the audience and Yeri picked it up and wrapped it around herself. Now pictures of it are going around twitter and people are raving about her support for the LGBT community. 

Now I've got no problem with Yeri supporting a cause she believes. I will be proud of her for expressing her views especially when it's a good cause. My problem lies in whether Yeri was actually aware of what she may have done. The flag itself looks like their outfits for Peek A Boo. What if she merely thought it was a flag that was made in support of them instead of for the LGBT community? Then that means that Yeri might just have gotten herself unwittingly in trouble at home in South Korea.

Fans have got to realize that Korea is not as forward thinking as Western audiences. Irene got herself into trouble by expressing support for feminism. I'm proud of her because she expressed her beliefs even if she knows it could get her into trouble with her korean male fanbase.  If Yeri knew fully what she was doing then I applaud her and support her. If not, whatever comes next is on whoever threw that flag and it's sad that she could possibly get in trouble for it at home in korea. By doing things like this, you're actually putting your idols in a tough spot. Especially if this turns out to be something they'd have to apologize for or make explanations for(to appease public sentiment even if they don't mean it. I mean Baekhyun had to apologize to his fans for dating for crying out loud) then you'd just end up disappointed in them and that's kinda unfair. 

PS: People threw the flags on stage again and it hit Joy and Irene on the 2nd day according to twitter. This really annoys me if it's true.",94,1,False,self,,,,,

1) Red Light (f(x))
2) Russian Roulette (Red Velvet)
3) Eung Eung (Apink)

which arent really directly related in sound lmao, beyond maybe electronic production. I love Red Light for its abrasiveness, and that it doesnt make the listener comfortable the entire song, and theres just so many different elements going on all of which I adore

Russian Roulette I love because I really like 8-bitty production, and for me it executes that perfectly. RR is also just in my opinion, a perfectly simplistic but still interesting pop song. Its related to Red Light maybe because Red Light is so harsh that it could creep people out, and RR has the almost haunting La-la-la-las, and how in the second parts of the verses, there is faintly the sound of the girls repeating Heart, Heart, Heart mixed into the instrumental which is slightly unnerving (but in a great way)

Eung Eung I like how the song constantly changes elements and production, but does it in a very clean way. I also really like how the song just sounds darker, but still has I guess , so much life in it? Idk I cant describe it too well. Also, Eung Eung is kind of a cross between Red Light and Russian Roulette in a way lmao

I would probably pick Loona's Rosy as the B-side I would listen to, given that I just fall in love with it more every time, Heejin's rap and the balance between Olivia and Gowon's vocals is amazing.

As for the title track, I'd probably pick NCT's Limitless. It's the song that first introduced me to NCT and it's a timeless classic for me. (I know it's not an actual classic, but it holds a spot near and dear to my heart, so I can't help to at least lean towards this song as my pick.)

##Variety
Throughout this comeback, they expressed wanting to go back to when they were rookies. So, they decided to do one V Live a day, as they did before they even debuted. I **bolded** the titles that were not their own V Lives to help make them stand out.

1. The Reddit post must get less than 10 comments, not including replies

2. The artist must've debuted in 2017 or later

3. They must be unknown on this sub. Many people are widely known by r/kpop but people just don't care about them. I will only include artists without a lot of buzz or awareness.

Also, I have started describing the concepts of the songs to hopefully help people find something they're looking for. If you think my description is inaccurate, let me know what you think would be better.

If you are a fan of any of these artists, share your knowledge. Post other songs people should check out or variety clips. This spotlight is supposed to get these groups more fans, so if you can, help out with that. 

Finally, if there was a release that I've missed comment or DM me and I will add it. 

Enjoy these new releases.

For me, it's the Shy 91-liners. 

The group has:

Chorong - Apink

Changsub - BTOB

Hoya - (former) Infinite

Jinyoung - (former) B1A4

Solar - Mamamoo

Initially, Chorong and Changsub were the only ones that were close. Aside from their group members and Cube artists, they were literally not close with anybody else. Then, Hoya comes in and becomes a good friend of them. Roughly a year later, Jinyoung joins the group. The way how Solar got in is pretty interesting. Changsub becomes somewhat close (but not really) with Solar. At the same time, he was worried about Chorong because she had ZERO female friends in the industry and wanted her to have one. Then he introduced Chorong to Solar. It took some time but they became very good friends. Solar then joined the group and became friends with everybody else.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but personality wise they all are very shy and reserved people. It's funny and fascinating how these really shy people come together and become really good friends. [Here is the evolution of the squad over the years.](https://twitter.com/B2PMGG_/status/1084745118131773441)

So my question is, what is your favorite squad in Kpop?",100,1,False,self,,,,,

Let me start by saying Ive been a casual Kpop listener for a few years. I was introduced to Hyuna and CL (thank you Psy) and dove down that rabbit hole pretty hard. In addition to 4minute and 2ne1, I discovered some others such as Big Bang, Exo, and super junior. Then I kind of got out of kpop when 2ne1 disbanded, only listening to a few songs randomly here and there. 


Fast forward to a few days ago, I decided to jam out to some kpop again. I clicked on a Big Bang song, and soon found Seungris new songs (which are amazing), and then just kept clicking on suggested songs. I came across some great tunes, by artists like ikon, block b, Bobby, and a bunch more. But one group really stood out to me: Stray Kids. 


Turns out theyre pretty new too, so thats cool. Almost every one of their songs is pure genius though. First one I listened to was Hellevator. I wasnt immediately captivated, but by the end of the song I was hooked, and played it again right after. Second one I heard was My Pace. Pretty cool beat, and I absolutely loved the meaningful lyrics. Then I found songs like N/S, question, district 9, and grr, which are all just straight fire IMO. I might have rambled a bit, but yeah, I cant wait to see what the future holds for this talented group. 


TLDR: I was in and out of kpop for a while, but Stray Kids has got me listening again. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

[Sixteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen_(TV_series\)) was a survival show in 2015 for 16 JYP trainees to form the girl group TWICE, with a Major and Minor concept - trainees would move up or down from Major team/Minor team depending on each evaluation (which not only showcased their abilities but through personality as well). It was met with some controversy due to its harsh differences in the Major/Minor team's treatment, the criticism that the trainees received on the show, and the fact that the group was originally going to be 7 members but suddenly brought Tzuyu and Momo back after they were eliminated, making the group 9.

TWICE members are in bold.

Personally, I find myself liking a lot of girl group songs that have 80s synthwave + synthpop vibes like April's [Oh! My mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2MhwXZ8IgM), T-ara's [Roly Poly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xolk2cFzlo), Apink's [%%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=499YUeNoYVE).

I've watched some of Winner's variety shows (e.g. Weekly Idol where I promptly fell in love with Jinwoo, but that's another story), but for the life of me I cannot tell which one is Seunghoon and which one is Seungyoon. The fact their names are the same except one letter doesn't help at all.

* people calming down a little if they find out their idol is dating. Still buck wild out here, but compared to how people acted when se7en revealed he was dating we have come a long way

Totally worth it, Red Velvet really are the best right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I arrived with my party at the venue (Verizon Theater) at around 1730 (5:30pm) and had to pay a cool $20 for parking. We lined up near where we parked but we got ushered to a shorter line around the other side and made out way in within ten minutes or so. During this time, some staff members gave everyone these small paper banners with a birthday message for Seulgi on one side (for us to hold up during Moonlight Melody) and another during Day 1 in the encore. Unfortunately, the merchandise was already sold out by the time we got in. I really wanted a lightstick but everything was gone. EVERYTHING!!!!!!! No more shirts, no more posters, zilch. Whatever, the real treasure are the girls. I grabbed a beer ($14 for about a pint) and a bottle of water ($4.50 - fuck the world) and sat down with my friend in section 105. Pretty close to the front, on the left side of the theater. Right in front of one of the big screens and close enough to get a great view of the stage.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd was pretty diverse, a wide variety of genders, ages, ethnicities. Not too many weirdos, besides myself of course. By my estimate it was probably 60-40 female to male, as befitting RV. A lot of people got dolled up for this concert too, but who wouldn't when they're going to see Red Velvet?

&amp;#x200B;

The show started with a VCR of RV going to a deserted theme park, and encountering the Redmare robot, who's named Reeve apparently (more on that later). They disintegrated and then the concert started.

&amp;#x200B;

When the girls first appeared, the crowd went absolutely frickin' NUTS. My ears are still ringing now at 0030, my throat is okay though even though I screamed my head off. Vocal training, YG/JYP take notes. They started with Russian Roulette and Power Up. I know everyone says this whenever they go to a live K-pop concert, but the girls are even more beautiful in real life. Unreal. Also they weren't as skinny as I thought they'd be, which is a good thing. They looked healthy, and Seulgi's arm muscles were particularly apparent. As strong as a bear (okay not really, more on THIS later). The backup dancers were pretty cool, they were good.

&amp;#x200B;

After Power Up they did their introduction and the screaming was outrageous.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, they played the instrumental of My Second Date while all the members did dance solos. Irene is a really good dancer, her movements are sharp and refined. But Seulgi is unreal, you can tell she's the pro. Mosquito next, then Look.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not actually sure if they were lipsyncing or not, partially perhaps, because a lot of notes and adlibs throughout the night did seem to be live. One thing about the sound system is that everyone sounded like they were singing and speaking one or two semitones higher than they actually were.

&amp;#x200B;

After Look, they played another VCR. Real weird stuff, the girls first transformed into CGI animals until they got to this Cinderella esque carriage, then they transformed back into their human forms. But then, a group of hunters chased after them, finally cornering the girls in some sort of hedgerow. The crowd gasped when those hunters roughly grabbed the girls by the arms. During this time the crew brought grass props onto the stage. Transition into Mr E. Really fun. Then, one of my highlights, ZOO. For these stages the girls changed into their animal outfits. Bunny Irene, Leopard Wendy, Chicken Joy, Unicorn Yeri and of course, Bear Seulgi.

&amp;#x200B;

Next was Happiness and the crowd really got revved up for this. We all chanted SOMETIMES, YOU GOTTA BE BOLD! Except by this point, half of us were actually bald. The girls were really sweating at this point, and Seulgi's hair got messy. So gorgeous. But still one more until their break, Hit That Drum. Joy was pouring sweat at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

I missed the next VCR because that beer caught up with me so I'm not sure what happened. I'm sure it was weird though, I heard laughing from the audience.

&amp;#x200B;

Next segment featured a short rendition of Lucky Girl, Bad Dracula and a nice surprise from the team in All Right. The members picked up baskets filled with autographed balls and threw them into the audience. Or at least tried to. Maybe it was because they were tired too, but these girls throw like Lisa Simpson. I had to stop myself from cracking up. The furthest they threw these balls was probably like five rows in. Poor Irene tried her best but she botched so many pitches.

&amp;#x200B;

An extended talk came next. Good old Englishwoman Katy tried to speak the most English after Wendy. The others mostly talked through an off stage translator, who was really good. Yeri is so cute in real life, and she always has this sassy, shameless face on. She's funny. They talked about fans meeting them at the airport and asked about attractions around Dallas. They also mentioned Seulgi's birthday, but we been knew. She was about to get a big surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

Next segment featured Blue Lemonade, About Love and Seulgi's birthday song, Moonlight Melody. We all held up our placards while Red Velvet sweetly serenaded us. Seulgi burst into tears during this and I did too. Kang Seulgi, when you cry, I cry. Even Yeri started tearing up. She might have a venomous tongue and razor wit but inside she's a big softie too. Seulgi did a big bow at the end and the girls walked backstage with tears in their eyes. A real emotional roller coaster so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Next was another VCR, really great this time. The girls strutted into a haunted house wearing their Bad Boy gear and the rest of them got abandoned by Irene. They navigated the house while constantly beset by horrific scenes of violence and death. There was one part where a locker banged open next to Joy and she just lost it in the most hilarious way. No acting there. Finally after five minutes they had enough and ran for the exit. Irene joined them at the end and the whole audience cheered loudly. Alexa play Mariah Carey Hero.

&amp;#x200B;

This led into Bad Boy preceded by a creepy rendition of the la la la la las from Ice Cream cake while the girls did a mannequin dance. This was probably the absolute loudest part of the concert. Of course, Bad Boy, the number one Reveluv favorite. And again, we all chanted WHO DAT WHO DAT WHO DAT **BOY** and drowned out their WHO DAT IS. Come on, give the people want they want. The English version with the WHO DAT BOY! Amazing performance, they looked stunning. Next was Peek-A-Boo and I guess I still have flashbacks from Produce 48 because I can't hear the fine fine fine fine fine fine FINE part without smirking. Rip Gyuri.

&amp;#x200B;

Another talk. This time Seulgi spent a lot of time talking about how surprised and thankful she was. Anything for Sluggy. ANYTHING. Yeri was like ""I started crying too, I don't know why, but I did."" She's a treasure. We sang Seulgi Happy Birthday. They commented on the haunted house VCR and Joy cheekily said that she was acting the whole time and wasn't scared at all. I think Yeri shot back with a ""you need to improve your acting then."" We laughed heartily. During this talk I believe they explained the whole Redmare concept, an amusement park with a creepy twist. Apparently Seulgi designed the robot and Yeri named him Reeve? I think? Because it means something in French. Google tells me ""rve"" means ""dream"" in French. That'd fit, because this is a REDMARE.

&amp;#x200B;

They introduced a song they had never performed before (Narrator: They had), RBB (English version). The crowd was really into it. So much for its polarizing reception. Then they said they would perform one final song, my super Lookie (Narrator: Red Velvet would once again be caught in a lie). Great.

&amp;#x200B;

They left the stage after and we all cheered. Eventually the audience started a fanchant of RED-VEL-VET and we stomped our feet and clapped. After about five minutes they played one more VCR showing that Irene was behind all the mischief in the previous stories. She drugged the members with some sort of concoction, ordered the hunters to chase the other girls, and set up the haunted house. For what reason, I have no clue. I thought Joy and Yeri were the children of Satan. Well in that case, Irene is a real Lilith. I stan.

&amp;#x200B;

The encore started with Day 1, nice bossa nova track. We held up the other side of the placard which has some message I can't understand. Maybe someone can translate. They gave one last talk and mentioned that they have a free day tomorrow so they'll be exploring around Dallas, checking out the sights and landmarks. Time for the really obsessive Reveluvs to camp out in the hopes of seeing them. They then closed out by giving their own thoughts and feelings about the concert and their tour, and promised THEY'LL BE BACK. Alexa, play Terminator 2 theme. I hope it's true because this is an experience of a lifetime. If you can go, GO, it's so great.

&amp;#x200B;

RV closed the show with the legendary Red Flavor. I literally got chills, especially during Wendy's high notes. They took a photo with the crowd and that was it baybee.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, how can I say anything other than it was a legendary experience? RV are metaphysically unable to disappoint. The screaming and cheering was so loud, the music so loud that I could have gone deaf. But if there would be anything worth going deaf for, it'd be an RV concert. I give this nine billion decibels out of nine billion.

Its not a role like the Main Dancer or Main Vocal or even Visual, which is mostly decided before they debut. 

Have you seen any groups where the Face of the Group has changed over the years? Maybe officially or unofficially? 

For example, Eunbin of CLC was/is classed as the Face because of Produce 101 but Ive seen a lot people say its now Yeeun with her rising popularity and Cube focusing on promoting her and her image the most in the MVs and other platforms. So she could potentially be the new Face of the Group for CLC.

So life got a bit busy over the week, so I was delayed in writing up this fan account. But I finally got some time, so...here we are!

So for those interested in the setlist, [here](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/oh-my-girl/2019/montgomery-theater-san-jose-ca-4395efeb.html) it is. Though, there is a slight mistake in the list - namely ""Coloring Book"" was a hybrid original/remix version, not just the standard one. Other then that, the setlist is correct.

Since I did not do the VIP option, I can't speak to that, but I can speak to everything else, so without further ado..let's jump into things!

**General Review (ticket prices, rules, etc.):**

So first off, the show was much shorter than I expected. It was about 85 minutes total if I recall, which was a bit of a bummer. Though they did have two long fanmeet style ments to that did sort of make up for things, I would have wished the overall show was longer since they have a decently sized discography.

Also, the ticket prices for P1 (non-VIP) were admittedly too pricey when one takes into account both the venue and OMG's domestic popularity. However, the venue looked sold out (no doubt helped due to it's smaller size) so things looked good there. For reference, the Montgomery theater fits 468 people, so a small but sizable crowd.

Also, the promoter/security were super lax when it came to fansite masters bring their gear at the venue. Thankfully, they were locked to being in the wings on the ground floor so they did not impede the viewing experience.

Surprisingly, the audience demographics were very mixed. There looked to be an even amount of men and women in the audience, and of various nationalities, though English speaking and Japanese speaking fans dominated. There was also varying age groups as well, as I saw people in the audience that were easily in their mid-30s/early 40s.

So it was cool to have that audience dynamic, as I think it gave things more looser vibe since it wasn't 99% women and then 1% men.

**Show Review:**

So overall, the show was great. The girls really gave 110% and loved the enthusiasm of the crowd. There were a ton of lightsticks out and the fanchants were loud - which was so cool since this was the first time I've seen a huge amount of international audiences really embrace those elements of a K-Pop show.

While the setlist was majority title tracks, they did do some popular B-sides, which was cool. The only title track that was missing was A-ing.

Due to the smallness of the venue, the stage wasn't too decorated or anything. There was just a jumbo screen in the back that played their MVs prior to the show and during the intermission prior to the encore. Also, the girls didn't have any costume changes at all.

The ments/Q&amp;A, meanwhile, were cute, but definitely disorganized. The staff didn't bother reviewing the fan-submitted questions beforehand, so many of the girls either didn't do much (since they pulled questions intended for other members - questions mainly were for Yooa, Mimi, or Binnie), had silly things like ""say you love \[Person X\], or was written in Japanese so the girls didn't really know how to answer it.

But the girls were still game for the ones they could do, and Seunghee thought we were ""the cutest"" .

In terms of English, Seunghee was definitely the best. The other members knew basic conversational, but Seunghee was straight up on the cusp of sounding fluent level.

I was in the 8th row (center) during the concert, and due to the size of the venue, still had a clear look at the stage. Funnily enough, being that close let me see how much work goes into styling Yooa for her on screen appearances. Her famous pout is definitely enhanced with makeup/styling and not natural. She looked so unlike what we see on screen that it literally took a few moments for me to recognize that I was seeing her. Hell, Mimi looked more like on-screen Yooa than Yooa did.

In terms of performance, the girls were on it. Everyone was great, choreo on point, and vocals were solid. Seunghee, especially slayed those high notes and riffs.

And speaking of Seunghee, seeing her live really imparted to me how much she embodies being an idol. She actually reminds me of Jurina a lot, because she really feels the music and always reflects that on her face when performing. She just had that aura that makes you constantly focus on her even when she's not the focus of the song at the moment. It really makes me want to see her in a subunit or something to see how she'd do with a different music genre.

On a sadder note, Yooa seemed to have been sick during the show, though you wouldn't know it as she performed 100% throughout it with no visible issue. She only popped away for a bit during the last ment, but I guess it got too bad to power though as she missed the final encore song completely. The translator came out after the final song to state that Yooa was ill and apologized for her not being able to do the final song. She also wasn't able to do the post-show meet and greet/photo-op either.

**Final Thoughts:**

While the Q&amp;A portions were disappointing, the music performance parts were top notch. Furthermore, while the ticket price was slightly too high, the overall show was great.

I would rate the show **8/10.**

And what are some examples of your favorites?

It could be related to the visual concept or the underlying meaning of lyrics, album themes, etc.

My personal favorite is the forearm-tapping move Seventeen do in the prechorus of [Thanks](https://youtu.be/7xKwpPQiPGs) - this specific move means Thank you in Korean sign language. Since Thanks is also a song dedicated to fans, the move near the end of the song where they link pinkies like in a promise does a good job at signifying that specific theme, I think.

Other examples that come to mind are:

- in Twices What is Love: in the chorus, they draw and dot a question mark in midair. In relation, the songs lyrics wonder about love, from the perspective of a girl who hasnt experienced it genuinely yet.

- in SVTs Pretty U: the cheek-tapping move in the chorus means pretty in sign language.

- in Red Velvets Dumb Dumb: they do a move where they mimic a robot, which relays the songs concept of being controlled/influenced by the emotions caused by a crush.

- in ATEEZs Say My Name: the visual concept of this MV/album seems to refer to Western themes (think punk goth cowboys ) - in the chorus, they do this move they call the driving dance, which looks like theyre riding horses while steering by the reins.",53,1,False,self,,,,,

Like if I did ""hey Ariana grande is lip syncing right now"" people would be like ""haha yeah lol""

But if I went like ""hey twice is lip syncing"" 

Fans would write me an essay that goes a little something like this :

""omg do you think it's easy being a singer that they need to sing all the time? Why do they need to prove their talent to us all the time? They are already so perfect doing the perfect choreos. Besides everyone lip syncs besides this is probably 1% real singing and 99% recording etc etc""


It's so weird because I'm just making a simple observation and people starts getting mad. Like I'm not even saying they have no talent. I am saying they are lip syncing.

But the fans imagine every single comment about their group is either a compliment or a hating remark.

This question isn't meant to offend or throw shade at any idols, but a common pattern that I've noticed in kpop is that some idols tend to have really nasally or somewhat nasal voices. I've been singing for a long time, and I have always been taught that this way of singing isn't the best for your voice. Is there a specific reason why? Is it the language or vocal training? Because you have singers (example: Ailee) who usually aren't nasal, but then you have others (can't think of any off the top of my head) who just have that maybe naturally? 

Again, I'm not throwing any shade, but I'm genuinely curious. Thanks to anyone who can answer!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Both male and female idols are fine but I'm particularly interested in male idols as I've realized there are a lot more female idols I can think of who found success outside their group and became a hit with the general public than I can male. For males I can think of G- Dragon, Taemin, Zico but not many more(specifically talking about second gen). 

When I say destined I mean idols who you genuinely think have the best chances of the lot and not just those we wish to. Please dont include artist who have already found success as soloist like Jennie and Mino as this is basically meant to be like a guess the future kind of game, just for fun. Based on things like popularity with the general public, talented in dancing, singing/rapping, visuals, variety, great stage presence ect.

I'll start off with my two best prediction:

EXO Beakhyun: He's a great singer and is great at variety, an adequate enough dancer from what I've seen and has great stage presence. Not to mention he has great visuals(which always helps with the general public) and from what I can tell is one of the most popular members within exo's fandom which always helps as it means more backing when he goes solo. I think his vocals and variety skills are the things that will really put him over the top, all SM has to do is to not mess up his solo song and highlight how great of a singer he is and get him on every variety they can and tell him to go wild. 

BTS Jimin: I debated with myself between choosing Jimin or RM for bts but ultimately Jimin's popularity put him over the top for me in terms of most likely to do well. Jimin is currently the most popular member(from what I can tell) within bts' fandom. He also happens to be the most popular among the general public(he was the number one idol in this years gallup polls and is usually first or second in brand rankings) which means major backing from armys and good reception from the public, a great recipe for success. I get major Taemin vibes from Jimin; that combination of sex appeal and great dancing  along with killer stage presence and while I don't consider him bts' strongest vocalist(I lean more towards V's vocals) he has a very indie/poppy voice that would be a hit with the right song choice. He's also passable in variety and seems to have the kind of soft visuals that Koreans find cute.

The tracks I really like are:

 S.E.S. - Dreams Come True (this is actually a cover of a european song but I like the korean version more)

Uhm JungHwa - Invitation ( this is also a kind of copy of George Michael - Fastlove)

I really like all the Korean versions of famous anglo sphere pop music.. I just feel in many ways Koreans can do it better. 

I Especially like this Latin Freestyle track by   1 (1992) -

Can you guys recommend me anymore KPOP in the style of Western Music? 80s, 90s, Latin Freestye, New Jack Swing, etc..  specifically 90s/early 2000s

I translate kpop music lyrics and random idol stuff once a week or so...anyways,   


After seeing this channel [In a nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q), I thought it be cool if I can do something like that for Kpop channel. Its gonna  take some time until I can get that good at motion graphics, but I gotta start somewhere. ([my 1st](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bituMTEulo)).

I was wanting to get some feedback on what people might be interested in.

1. K pop history - Talking about evolution of kpop from 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s. Essentially describing how kpop came to be. Who dominated each era, what are they doing now.  

2. Top song - This is not only listing top 10 in year XXXX, but describing how it impacted the kpop scene. The first hook song, the first to use synthesizer, how song became banned, etc..  

3. Biography - I noticed that not all info gets translated to English. There are bloggers who solely focus on certain artist in Korea, I'm not talking about height,weight, preferences ,but actual biography people research and make it into small videos ( like BBC/CNN/FOX did on PSY, BTS, and now blackpink) So i figured, i can do some research and make similar video in motion graphics.  

4. Define it - These are like small things like ""what awards are the best in korea"" 'how does chart work"" ""what is triple crown"" ""how do you define 1st-4th generation"" ""how did company XXX became etc.."" ""how music program works""  

5. Etc - My first one was based on a interview on Korean youth festival held in Korea. I narrated of course (for copyright issue), but things of that nature. I saw that it didn't have English translation anywhere, so i figured it was a easy one (although it was surprisingly hard). There are lot of interviews done by magazine that simply does not cross to the west, so things of that nature

let me know what number seems most ...useful(?) to have it on youtube. And if you have any topic suggestions, do let me know. thanks

Welcome to 2018 Rookies - Nugu Groups Edition post! The remaining groups will be in Part Two! This post encompasses the the ~~legendary~~ nugundary entertainment debuts of 2018, including any comebacks that may have happened post-debut. Why are these groups first?  Well, you may have heard of them, but they didn't make any big headlines.

Some things:

* **Most** pictures reflect the current lineup of the group (if available).
* If there is any rookie group that I missed or if the links are wrong, please let me know :)
* Song descriptions are summarized from the MNet album page
* Stay tuned after this for Part Two (relatively known and well known groups)

**Nugu Legends - Former members of other nugu groups**

|*Group Name, Company*|*Concept*|*Debut Song (MV link) /Description*|*Description*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[AiRiSu](https://imgur.com/pInfn6n), Jang Ent|Cute Summer|[Oppa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmIeVH9L4EA) \- Reinterpretation of 80s/90s game music with modern EDM and cuteness|There are two familiar faces here if you follow nugu groups on the regular: there's HanU (formerly [10x10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6vguT3tq6k)) and Yina (formerly [Pocket Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiwnRymlFYU) and [Tweety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEhBxZZhFck)). Onto their song: What would Kpop be without a debut song called Oppa? This song is very cute, and I don't mean that in an endearing way. But, the song is simple and fun, and if that's what you are looking for, then you'll enjoy it. Eunbi has [standout-level talent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8MSgbvXqFQ). Yina has made her solo debut with ""[Without You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKFGDwjSJ3U)"" and HanU had a chance to record an [OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7hwjMsEiC0) for the drama Love to the End. They are rumored to be preparing a band-themed comeback.|
|[Blue Fox](https://imgur.com/Ikfr3gH), Blue Fox Ent|Mature/2nd Gen Kpop sound|[Wake Me Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I8z18g3CoE) \- Following the music that is loved by the masses|As someone who has stuck with BABA throughout all of the lineup changes they've had since debut, you'd think I would keep up with the former members and what they're doing. I didn't, which is why I had no idea that Blue Fox was a thing. Three of the members were members of BABA during the [Funky Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D55SrJri7Lw) era, and prior to BABA, Song Eyaki was a member of [ACE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83YjTjTel5Q). They are joined by newcomer Aria, and I sincerely hope they don't disband this time around. Wake Me Up has that 2nd-generation girl group sound that isn't so common in new releases. I saw some comments that it bears a strong resemblance to [9Muses' Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwN_Axs7pL4) but I don't know the song well enough to judge that.|
|[Destiny](https://imgur.com/Vtyy4ff), D-Side Ent|Sexy Girl Crush|[Like a Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UM8PqnTY80) \- Dance song of Moombahton genre with exotic and intense African rhythms, ear-popping sources, and EDM elements|Destiny's lineup boasts amazing vocalist Bohye, a former member of short-lived groups [Kiss&amp;Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCC4XQj4aUc) and [Bella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoBnAq9PtLY), as well as J.C., a former leader of Wanna.B who boasts a pretty resume for her time as a dance trainer. The other members are also dancers, which explains why the [choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw3YpfrcPr4) has so many good parts in it. However, I was disappointed partially due to the talent-stacked lineup this group has. Like a Bomb starts off very well, but the chorus was more like a spark than a bomb. There was a pretty good buildup to it, but I personally found the chorus and the yahh-yahh part to be flat. Otherwise, the song is good.|
|[GBB](https://imgur.com/gMsieEb), LOUDers Ent/Probeat Company|Retro|[Kemi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e_fflfMq-w)\- Funky and light-hearted brass with retro-scene syndrome and rhythmic guitars|GBB is literally [Sol-T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVYP8soNCSk) (minus Gyeowool) with the addition of Singaporean actress/trainee Cheris Lee and pageant model Sona Kim. I was a fan of Sol-T when they debuted and I was excited for GBB. However, silly me assumed they'd debut with a ssenunni style concept/song. I have to say, I've never been so happy to be wrong. With Kemi, both the song and [dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWLuRuFBHo) are incredibly fun, and ChaeHee's rap definitely shines here.|
|[Rose Finger](https://imgur.com/Dmuh1op), YC:BROS Ent|4 Rappers|[HIBIDIPOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7U2OaZ-O9U)\- Jungle jambe&amp;tom mix on an 808 beat (does anyone know what this means?)|Remember [Dorothy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TsDMKQ7-EI)? The group with the amazing debut that disappeared for no apparent reason? Yes, I'm bitter. Well, Subin was supposed to debut with them after a sudden lineup change. In addition, Hayan was a member of the very very short-lived girl group [DICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkeuDIzxXi4). HIBIDIPOP is very interesting. I get the 4 rappers concept and all that, but when you open your [live stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHCXLSe70k) with something as wonderful as this, what is there to rap about? I honestly wish the music video was full of these costumed spider-men chanting in the streets and yelling out ""HIBIDIPOP"" when necessary as opposed to the hard-working man with milk emanating from his pores.|
|[SIO SIJAK](https://imgur.com/3CAgw7O), Gooddream Ent|Girl Crush|[La La La](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTVmSw_NVfg) \- Expressed the feeling of the trap genre over the powerful 808 sound|Yelim is a former member of [Scarlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjAEmDRaxT4), and it is said that she has scouted many times for her [dance skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fXokVR7sko) (more on this later). As for La La LA, when I first heard the song, I didn't like it that much, but a few days later I woke up and it was stuck in my head. I prefer the song without the music video and often find myself krumping to it (yes). The chorus is anticlimactic, and the vocals sound just okay. I also commend their [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvV9WXrF7Zs). They aren't strong dancers, at least not in this style, but they seem to have a passion for it.|
|[Tropical](https://imgur.com/s7xCQK2), LUK Factory|Girl Crush|[Mwah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24VeVMFHQQY)\- Hybrid dance song based on hip-hop, house, and Moombahton|This is not at all what you'd expect from a group called Tropical. Eunsol is a former member of [Bambino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ_GIRTTRaA) and she adds a level of charm to an already charming group. Honestly, the first time I heard the song was with the music video, which is comprised of behind-the-scenes footage of Tropical. The song doesn't really go anywhere, but I decided to watch their [live stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjXIVC2C3tE). Oh man. They are very confident performers and certain parts of the [choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCRyVCBAbs) are very powerful (bless you Jeonghyun). I am wholeheartedly hoping LUK Factory finds them an impactful and dynamic song show they can show more powerful choreography.|

**WAKE UP KPOP FANS!!!!!** *Disclaimer: Some of our nugu legends belong here also.*

|*Group Name, Company*|*Concept*|*Debut Song (MV link) /Description*|*Description*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[ALiKe](https://imgur.com/LZD1Epm), Base4|Summer|[Summer Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrmviSH05JQ) \- California girl with trendy surf music and cool tropical sounds, and all the virtues of a summer song|This song is a literal breath of fresh air. The members have very nice and unique voices and although the song isn't perfect, it provides for a great summer listening experience. The [choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TrniDnSQXI) is also fun and fits the song pretty well. The company is tiny but their goal is to achieve the highest quality possible. Wookjin has impeccable taste (we love people who love [Sunmi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz5GlOwG1vA)). All of the members are talented, and they love having [fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VnqibAZu7M).|
|[AZM](https://imgur.com/XGQ4kLi), Innok Ent|Girl Crush|[Edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIk2QoW6qL0) \- Sophisticated girl crush song that stands out with witty VOX SYNTH|The group is full of talent, and it shows in their songs to a certain degree. They debuted with Edge, an upbeat, future-bassy song that should satisfy the girl-crush loving crowd. It does a nice job of showcasing the members vocals and rap skills, as does their comeback, [Our Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xltL8-DTrB0). Like it's predecessor, Our Story was dangerously under-promoted. Seeing that AZM is [still active](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMZjgdyquux43dkmb7wTtJw/videos), I'd love to see whatever they come out with next WITH some good promotion.|
|[Cherry on Top](https://imgur.com/0IhKgJh), United Creative|Energetic|[Hi Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIu3McQ09TE) \- Two-step garage style pop dance song|Why wasn't this song promoted? One appearance on [Simply Kpop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oviGjcPwET0) does not count, people! Beyond being one of the best debuts I've seen this year, it's one of my favorite releases of 2018, period. This is pretty solid all around, and the [dance break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCnOYeIm4rw) is the cherry on top! I do they they seemed a bit shy during their debut stage but this group has good things coming if they can catch the eye of the public. They made a comeback with [May Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebgNAF6q_Q), which is a great song and displays their vocals nicely.|
|[Kokoon](https://imgur.com/EHNfBZR), Yoonseo Group|Gag idols|[What?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlHIWh2C2oY) \- A song that will be delivered to the masses with strong, addictive beat and lyrics|So this is Kokoon-a joint venture between Korea and Japan to produce the first gag-idol boy group. ""What?"" is one of those songs where the chorus is more like a dance break, and while the choreography is good, the execution isn't that strong. The group has a comedian/idols concept, and I wish it had been incorporated more into the music video. In December, they released a [Christmas single album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBCnnYk7-h4) that displays their vocals moreso. They could definitely use some improvement, but there's potential to be unlocked here, folks.|
|[Maywish](https://imgur.com/r438sLt), J9 Ent|Youthful|[Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJbd-Ocj6OQ) \- Disco funk-style dance pop genre with a bass rhythm|Hello is a very nice song, in a similar style to Lovelyz' sound. The vocals here are very pretty. The song is nothing new and is at times predictable, but it still has that ""vitamin"" effect that these songs have. The song [choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJI4KOaKw) is simple, but sweet. Their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdZ26bjV4LnhTTdB1nTAD8w/videos) is updated often with new content, and they have a few cool [covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDT68as5yaA) up there. They also seem to be pretty good dancers, and I'd love to see them cover a Gfriend song.|
|[YJIG](https://imgur.com/gwH5GRg), WEF Ent|The Gfriend who Raps|[Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY33Ive9fCw)\- Lively dance song with melodic synths and orchestra|There's a lot of aegyo in the music video for Prince, but it was redeemed by the rap, which was a pleasant surprise. I really like the instrumental on this, but the [choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CklZKVO7fzE) contains a few recognizable girl group point dances, so I'm a bit disappointed by the dancing bit. There's a lot of potential to be explored here, and I think with a better budget and a good creative team, YJIG could put out some really good stuff. Is it just me, or does Muah (the rapper) look a lot like Kei?|

**The Potential Is There**

|*Group Name, Company*|*Concept*|*Debut Song (MV link) /Description*|*Description*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[Flor.Us](https://imgur.com/Czkpyke), YEOM Ent|Tackling social issues|[Because of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPwbQrqBP24)|*They are the girl group Kpop deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll crowdfund them. Because they can use it. Because they're not our heroes. They're silent guardians. Watchful, masked members. A* *Flor.Us.* I can't stand to sit through another decent Kpop song that suffers due to lack of budget and is therefore destined to be performed in uniforms even though it doesn't fit (looking at you, [Masquerade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xckebgTXbJ0).) If you can somehow get a hold of their mini-album, realize that there are so many good things that can be done here beyond dancing with masks while wearing a school vest. Also, check out their [Bingle Bangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMNUAahsnl8) cover.|
|[Kitten Girls](https://imgur.com/56KA37c), Wannabe Academy|Short global unnies|[U Me Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWvov2_KJQk) (Korean version) - Intense marching band section with addition of energy-filled Eurodance|It seems to me like Kitten Girls had a ton of fun recording this song, because they recording it four times: in Korean, [Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs5hmHdZQVA), [Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU9XtgK7o3M), and [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT_RCuy5aOA). Find yourself another group that caters to the international crowd like this! They seem very happy in the music video also, as if they're having genuine fun doing it. The verses in U Me Us are very marching band-y, while the chorus is a lot more dance-y but the song is enjoyable.|
|[Like a Movie](https://imgur.com/EjrsAoE), Top Cloud Ent|Film concept|[Twilight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuiOTIaCCKs)|Twilight is an upbeat and funky song with [choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymtm7HzE2vU) that fits it very well. The choreography was done by member Domo, so that's cool. One issue I have with this is the audio quality- their voices sound clouded over if that makes any sense. Other than that, Like a Movie shows promise. They keep their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSMJDDmOSHE98IbWOPekWAQ) updated regularly, so if you're interested in following them, check it out. One member has left since debut; Howoo, who helped compose and write Twilight, had to leave in January 2019 due to an injury. He was placed in a new group, Chaze, due to their less strenuous choreography.|
|[Pierce](https://imgur.com/aPrSzc4), Clevr Ent|Little girl crush|[Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEHpkSJw5L4)|*PIERCE in* *~~your area~~* *the house!* If you're primarily a girl group fan, when people say ""Girl groups can't dance like boy groups"", show them [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cwdZQ3uvEo). Then tell them to shut up and to be gone from your life (unless it's your mother). This group has an age range of 11-14, and they have managed to release two of the best girl crush songs in the third generation of Kpop, which says a lot of things. They recently came back with [Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgk8o2FZLrU) (after the departure of Chaeyoon, who will be truly missed). I'm not one for idols debuting younger than 16/17-ish, and I'm not sure how these kid groups work, but if any of these kids debut again in a few years, they're going to be absolute beasts. They are already [memes in the making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQw4-IgThfk).|
|[Sugar Tint](https://imgur.com/y4llwl1), Ramah Ent|Retro|[Heart Ppyong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY-2prPuzwQ) \- Disco dance song with heart|You don't see many groups debuting with retro concepts anymore, unfortunately, but Sugar Tint did just that and captured the spirit of the disco. There are plenty fun and unique moments in the song and the music video but they work very well. I also enjoy the chorus, as it's very simple but catchy. The vocals are not the best but they work very well for the song.|
|[To.1](https://imgur.com/ECnGI1W) (debuted as x:time), Yeon SR Ent|Not really sure|[Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOy2HX7U3HI)|It was incredibly difficult to find information on this group as (1) their SNS has been wiped out, leading me to believe that they are disbanded, and (2) everything left about them is in Japanese. I'm not sure if any of the To.1 lineup were apart of the debut period (x:time) because there's NO INFORMATION. Anyways, Spotlight sounds like it would've done better as a b-side but the voice distortions are driving me nuts. I thought it was funny that they were dancing in front of public transportation. If you aren't a fan of buses, there's [another version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3EqEbFlNCE) of the dance practice. Here's also of [dance cover of Bboom Bboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqdy8AKP1Cc) from their Youtube channel.|

|[Bburector](https://imgur.com/2lZIR5p), BBU Ent|Blog Jockeys|[Ice Cream](http://vod.afreecatv.com/PLAYER/STATION/33794752) \- Sweet and playful vocals with bright and lovely dance music|When I first heard this song, I wondered ""What company trained these girls, said 'Let's debut!' and then gave them this song?"" So, I decided to do some digging and turns out, this group is full of AfreecaTV blog jockeys. They were partly redeemed by this fact because they are in fact not professional singers and untrained to do this, and honestly their dong is no where near as...*interesting* as the next group on this list.|
|[B Girls](https://imgur.com/jZedq9h), Digital Record|Blog Jockeys|[Blue Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejCYH4f_aU)|This song...is honestly not very well put together in a bunch of different aspects. However, there seem to be some people who enjoyed it so there's a remote possibility that you will also. This group, like Bburector, is made of blog jockeys, but this song lacks the redeeming factor that Ice Cream has.|
|[CST](https://imgur.com/5HDcQQd), Dreamcense|Being questioned|[Be You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynJ38_8RaEI) \- Confidence in yourself|Due to ""touring"" and teaching a bunch of dance classes, prior to debut CST had the support of their many Southeast Asian fans who eagerly awaited them. Let's just say that if this were a concert and I couldn't wait to see my faves after so long, and was given ""Be You"", I would angrily demand my money back. Despite the message of the song, that of being confident and empowering yourself, I found myself very ashamed. I saw someone call this a (quote) ""hoe anthem""...it's more of a ""no anthem"". There's only one member, [Sunny](https://www.instagram.com/songbak/), who seems to be active in the realm of the World Wide Web. After some digging, I've been led to believe that she is Singaporean. So, if there's any good thing I can say about this, it's that Sunny is from Singapore. Go figure.|
|[My Darling](https://imgur.com/Iuxvi8f), AL Ent|Cute|[Dramatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai9LQQ2vNO4)\- Sophisticated fusion pop song with a powerful kick and bass|You may possibly remember (or have never heard of) their 2017 pre-debut release, [I Like You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUnxoVuWAlE). Um, let's just say that we've come a long way since then. Honestly, I'm not a fan of Dramatic, and I think the vocals here are a bit weak. However, I think with more (and I'll say it, better) training, they could be saved vocally. I think they have a new member but I'm not exactly sure because their SNS is not updated very often with all of them members.|
|[Kingdom](https://imgur.com/Fyy50RK), no company||[Hold Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=yQrfWd4pAhw) \- Depicts a man who can not forget his ex-girlfriend and gets tired of memories|Kingdom debuted with a single album, featuring title track Hold Up and b-side [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjJhX9Op1PQ). I personally found Hold Up to be very... frenetic. At first I liked the instrumental but after a while I just wanted it to CALM DOWN! Sorry, I have these outbursts. You is a bit calmer then Hold Up but the vocals seem a bit weaker here in comparison to Hold Up, and I think the music overpowers their voices quite a bit, making them seem weaker. Oh, and if you've listened to ""You"" (hehe), yes, that is the same ""Ahhh..."" from Catellena. There seem to be [more members](https://www.facebook.com/KingdomS-%ED%82%B9%EB%8D%A4%EC%A6%88-565470653800598/) now that join them in busking performances and dance covers but I'm not sure if they will debut officially.|

Im living in a very small European country where landing roles or doing anything entertainment industry related is completely impossible. There is like 1 show per year and most of the roles are being played by people who are in their mid thirties, they barely get paid and no one watches them anyways .. I originally wanted to go to the US but if you want to pursue acting there you need an acting visa, which you can get only if u have a lot of acting experience in another country where you can work legally. The thing is - I dont think I look Asian or anything like that (&amp; dont want to, Im white and proud of my nationality), but I do have quite a few features that could be seen on idols - VERY pale skin (everyone in here is tan &amp; people keep asking me why Im so pale lmao), a prominent aegyo sal (I swear I originally thought I just had EYEBAGS and I was so confused for years then when I visited a doctor she told me its just natural eyefat right under the eyes &amp; then when I remembered all/most idols actually have it I was shocked as hell), small v-lined face and a small nose with a high bridge. Many people in my school constantly say I look Asian (Im in the only international school in my country and we have 2 Thai students + 1 Chinese one and they themselves have told me so before out of nowhere, I guess it has to do a lot exactly w the aegyo sal) and like ... in all honesty thinking about it, wouldnt it be easier for me to break into kentertainment? Or at least try to work for 1-2 years in Korea so that I can get a visa for the US? I turned 16 this year &amp; starting this summer Im gonna star in the terrible drama of the year in our country that no one is gonna watch anyways lmao and Ill most likely star in next year ones too, so I will have a bit experience on my resume. I know K-POP idols really have to be Asian, and I dont think there should be any white Korean artists either, but when it comes to movies/tv shows there are literally roles for everyone .. I mean, Hollywood refused to accept Asians in their projects for a realllly long time, but now there are Asians landing some pretty good and well paid roles, so why cant the same thing go for kentertainment (talking about movies/dramas only). Im posting this here bc I know very well that the best agencies have acting trainees too and that theyre always able to get them good roles. I know me, a white girl coming from a small country, starring in Korean dramas may sound weird, but I am a realist. I myself could become anything and attend any university anywhere given my grades, knowledge + financial stability, but its not what I want. Ive always been very passionate about acting but I had never actually gotten the chance to pursue it for-real. I go to vacations in Thailand during the winters often too, because there its summer (while its winter in the EU) and by what Ive seen - Asian people seem to like me a lot! Most Thai people (at least in Phuket) dont know as much English but I got absolutely shocked to see people wanting to take pictures of me and telling me Im pretty! I know theyre good mannered and et cetera, but as I said - I guess I look appealing to them, as well as to the Asian students in my school, because Ive been told so by them personally. Do you think itd be possible for me to try acting in Korea or any other Asian country? Im not worrying about the language given the fact that I already am fluent in 6 (god knows why, I need to thank my immaculate memory about that) and it would be easy for me to learn any of them if needed, but if there is no possibility at all I dont see a reason to waste my time at all.. what do you guys think? Would there be any agencies willing to accept me ?",11,1,False,self,,,,,

[Video Here](https://youtu.be/wfEb4kzweCY)

I for one think this is unfair to the fan. 

Just because you couldnt see her pants downstairs mean she wasnt wearing shorts or something. And lots of fans follow Kpop groups from place to place. (Including Fansites)

Walking next to Jungkook seems to be her only crime and for that she is being wrongfully punished. (In my opinion) its not fair to basically ruin her life with all these video, posts, and here comments.

It's voting time again. Just like last week, each redditor has up to 7 votes each. You have to choose 11 idols each time.

For this week, it's also group evaluation time. Using Random.org, all of the 100 idols has been split up into 16 groups, with 4 groups of 7 and 12 groups of 6. 2 groups will face-off and each redditor is to choose 1 idol from each match-up to support. The group with the higher total will be given 100 benefit votes to each member. Each idol will also add on the number of votes during the group evaluation voting they receive to their overall total during the elimination round at Week 4. The number of votes of each idol will be revealed next round as well together with the 2nd week ranking. You can only vote ONCE for the group evaluation.

The reasons why I love Kpop goes beyond the music.  Things like breaking down of gender steriotypes, the positive lyrics and the way idols treat another with respect (even if they don't like each other).
So I'm worried that these things will be lost overtime as Kpop continues to get bigger in the west.
Plus can we stop acting like Kpop needs validation from the West?  Even though it is the biggest music market and I know companies like to brag about it when they do manage to achieve a level of success there.  The truth is Kpop has survived and will continue to survive without it.
That being said, I love seeing Kpop groups coming over but my hope is that they don't change what made us all fall in love with them in the first place.

About a week ago, I [responded to a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/am2nnf/momolands_kim_tae_ha_shows_support_for_her_cousin/efivnd9) in this subreddit from someone asking for a list of related kpop idols. I figured, meh sure -- it's something I've been meaning to do for years anyways so why not. At the time of my posting, I figured the only people who would see my promise was me and OP and it wouldn't be a big deal if I fell through and never delivered. Welp, 100+ upvotes showed me (granted that 100 upvotes aren't a lot by any means but it's a bigger number than 1 for sure).

Anyways, long story short I got to work almost immediately on compiling information. About 30 minutes into it though, I got sidetracked because I couldn't stand the design of my site and really did not want to revive it under it's current state. So that list was paused while I spent the next week building a new website design from scratch and cleaning house of all the junk posts that accumulated over a 10 year span.

So that that's done. I've hobbled together a mostly functional code that I'm sure I'll be fixing for weeks to come. Now is the step where I formally re-introduce my site to the fandom and get to work again.

To do that I've taken one of our most popular lists and split it into two: [Male Idol Fandom Names](http://kpoplists.com/post/155750006856) and [Female Idol Fandom Names](http://kpoplists.com/post/182810846201).

Because I've been on the outskirts of kpop for the past 3 years I'm sure there's groups and soloists I've missed, or meanings that aren't there that should be. Feel free to correct me and I'll update the list ASAP.

Anyways, to keep this on topic and generate some discussion lets use this post to talk about fandom names again!

* What are your favorite meanings behind some fan names that you never knew existed?
* Which fandom names just seem like the company or group was making it up as they went along?
* Which names just don't seem to match the group *at* *all*?
* Which group's fandom name would you steal for your faves if you could?",135,1,False,self,,,,,

It got me thinking about just how much his image has changed since then. He kinda came off as this cute, shy kid who you almost wanted to take care of back in their early days, but now he comes off as quite sophisticated and wise considering his age, and is known for giving his fans [good advice](https://twitter.com/Harujisoo/status/1091677515398111233). Seeing him on Idol Producer as a trainer has only got me thinking about it more, as he acts as a really good mentor despite not being that much older than a lot of the trainees there. He really seems to have figured out the kind of person he is and what his interests are. 

I know there are a lot of idols who simply open up after they've been debuted for a while and have solidified their position in the industry, but I also think there are a number who genuinely change with their experiences in kpop. Of course it's nearly impossible to know their personalities for sure, but just from your own observations, do you guys see anything like this in some of your favorite groups or idols?",48,1,False,self,,,,,
1618,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-2-15,2019,2,15,15,aqtxk4,self.kpop,Foreign K-Pop idols from Asia seem to have a bigger advantage over their Korean colleagues,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/aqtxk4/foreign_kpop_idols_from_asia_seem_to_have_a/,beginkookie,1550213649,"I just realized a lot of foreign idols (aside from the US/Europe ones) end up having long, A-lister careers ahead of them even post their K-Pop peak, and very few of their Korean contemporaries end up having the same path. Just look at the Thai and Chinese idols who eventually return to do projects in their motherlands and get treated as A-listers (and eventually become A-listers). I won't be surprised if this also happens to Japanese idols (I mean look at Roommate's Otani Ryohei who gets glossed over in Korea but is now starring in the most popular primetime dramas in Japan). 

While Korean K-Pop idols eventually continue pursuing careers post their peak, very few of them experience being true A-listers, just having ""gp relevancy"" is already attained by a select few, and aside from IU &amp; Suzy, it's hard to think of Korean idols who continued to be top tier celebs as individuals after their K-Pop idol phase (usually post enlistment when newer acts have taken over). On the other hand you have Nichkhun, Bambam, Lisa, EXO's Chinaline, Victoria, Sandara who are all hailed as top stars in their homelands. 

Even the Chinese trainees in Broduce like Jung Jung (Zhu Zhengting) and Justin who barely made it after two eliminations in the Korean version are doing projects that are bigger than the Wanna One members after entering the final line up for Nine Percent in China's Idol Producer. They were special guests at the Balmain show at Paris Fashion Week last month, doing high end magazine spreads, big endorsements and have so much buzz in China, it almost feels like them losing in Broduce KR was a blessing. Even a lot of failed foreign idols in Korea (for example Roi/Qinfen of The Legend, Hou Haoming &amp; Xing Zhaolin - ex SM trainees) are now becoming hot property in their homelands.

Meanwhile, Korean idols usually face a lot of uncertainty the moment group activities are halted/lessened and they're on their own aside from members who have major solo power. Even with this, there have been instances of Korean K-Pop idols who are assumed to have good solo power losing momentum after some time of individual activities or their solo work just not doing as well as presumed it would.

It just struck me that in the bigger picture of things especially in a long term perspective, it seems Asian foreign idols walk away with a bigger advantage in K-Pop - they become multilingual, get tons of global performing experience and are assured of a flourishing entertainment career waiting at home. While Korean idols don't really experience functioning outside the systems their companies impose and what they themselves are used to (not many of them can speak any language in a working proficiency outside of Korean) so the ability to branch out and gain more genuine opportunities in the later portion of their careers become more difficult for them.",38,1,False,self,,,,,

As a school with many famous people, they will have special panel where idol students come to post for press and such, sometimes with fellow members who came to congratulate. Its good PR for both school and group itself. Sopa even have idol students get on stage to receive special awards for being their famous student (I guess). However, there is one person who didnt get any of that. She is PRISTINs Xiyeon, who come to graduation ceremony with Taxi, no manager, no fellow members came to congratulate, didnt got to appear on celebrity panel, didnt get into stage and receive any awards. She is exactly normal student now even she is already debut. She also went into her kakao chat room to personally thank her fans since theres no SNS post from official account.

So whats next? I mean we kinda know that PLEDIS pretty much pretend the group didnt exist since PRISTIN V. There is half ass happy new year post but it just that. I feel like today is actually a good opportunity for PLEDIS to show a positive vibes of the group (I mean they dont even need all members to come and congratulate her, just one is already good). I know they have a bad track record with After School but PLEDIS didnt abandon the group after just one comeback like this. It just one of the most bizarre things a K-Pop right now.

What do you think will happen with the group. Gone for good? Or if they finally have a comeback, when it will be?",197,1,False,self,,,,,

1758,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-2-16,2019,2,16,14,ar5w45,self.kpop,Fan Account - Red Velvet REDMARE Concert in Chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ar5w45/fan_account_red_velvet_redmare_concert_in_chicago/,postsonlyjiyoung,1550296098,"What's up memers, it's your resident KARA fan (there are literally 3 of us) here to provide you clowns with an account of my wonderful experience at the most recent Red Velvet concert.

At the time of writing this I'm in the car on the way back from the concert. A bit of backstory on me as a kpop fan - my friend introduced me to the vids and I was a super hardcore SNSD and KARA fan for since 2013 (rip jessica). My favorite active group, however, is Red Velvet. Although my interest in kpop has waned over the years, as I'm no longer staying up until 2 in the morning watching SNSD variety shows, I still do follow it here and there and enjoy some of the music and personalities. 

I actually bought tickets to the Red Velvet Chicago fanmeet about a year (?) ago but had to sell them after realizing I couldn't make the trip. I live about 7 hours away from them, which obviously complicates things. I ended up losing 40 bucks doing that. If you're one of those people (you know who you are) who still make fun of me for this debacle, fuck you. I mean I deserve to be ridiculed but fuck you anyway, lmao.

When I heard Red Velvet was coming to Chicago again I was ecstatic. Hoping to avoid what happened last time, I snatched up tickets ASAP and finally made plans to head over to Chicago. The weather cooperated, thankfully, and I was on my way.

After about 7 hours in a car (took a break at my parents' house on the way) I was finally in Chicago. I grabbed a spicy chicken sandwich from Chick-Fil-A and headed to the theater. Unfortunately, all the merch sold out by the time I got there, which was obviously disappointing. 

As a 22 year old male, I wasnt sure what kinds of people to expect to see at a concert like this but it seems like people of all different ages, genders, whatever, were gathered to appreciate Red Velvet, which was cool. I sat next to some dudes and we talked about our distate for Really Bad Boy LMAO

[Here was the view from my seat, excuse the potato cam quality](https://www.photobox.co.uk/my/photo/full?photo_id=501667175034)

The show started, and after one of those mini movie things, the girls came on stage to perform in those girl scout outfits with the red skirts. It was honestly kind of surreal to see them in real life after just looking at kpop idols through a screen. They performed Russian Roulette and a few other songs I can't remember [nvm the setlist is here lol](https://www.setlist.fm/stats/average-setlist/red-velvet-43d83b1b.html?tour=53d0fff1)

Now I'm probably one of the few people on earth who doesn't really like RV's b-sides all that much. My two favorite songs by them are Kingdom Come and Oh Boy, but after that it's a pretty steep drop-off for me. That being said, watching them perform the songs live made me appreciate them more. I found a new song, Mosquito, that I actually ended up liking a lot.

They spoke on stage after a few songs and they were really cute. I'm glad they mentioned Chicago deep dish pizza - no performer shouldn't mention that.

But anyway, after a couple series of performances and videos, they eventually had one scary video with them in these really hot black outfits and performed Bad Boy and Really Bad Boy in English, which was FUCKING INSANE cause the crowd sang along instead of the usual mumble in korean until english word shit that happened for the rest of the songs lol. Like damn the energy was electric. Absolutely ridiculous.

They eventually changed again ([seulgis legs tho](https://www.photobox.co.uk/my/photo/full?photo_id=501667175207) and performed an encore, and we held up [signs](https://www.photobox.co.uk/my/photo/full?photo_id=501667174014) that we got for free. They wished their goodbyes and took a picture with the crowd...it was awesome. 

I guess you might be wondering how I thought they looked. Obviously, they're incredibly pretty - my vision is ass and I was far away but I trust my eyes enough to make this claim. They're also a lot smaller than I expected, but I've heard other people say that about kpop idols in the past.

Overall, pretty unforgettable experience. I definitely want to go to a concert again, and hopefully Red Velvet's, since they're great performers with a lot of energy. It took some planning and a lot of money but I definitely don't regret my experience. I'd encourage you guys to attend a concert once in your life - you (probably) won't regret it!

Let me know if you have any questions since I'm sure I didn't address everything. That would be impossible. Also my fingers hurt. Ill upload vids if yall care about that

You will be entertained even if you're just a casual K-pop fan and not necessarily a hardcore Blink.

This post feels like a mess organization-wise but hopefully you glean some useful/interesting info from it.

So, I bought Cat4 tickets ([seatmap](https://mediabank.sportshub.com.sg/s3fs-public/inline-images/BlackPink-Seatmap.jpg) for reference) for me and the mrs. back in December. We'd watched Redmare in Singapore last October so this would be our 2nd K-pop concert.

Arrived at the Singapore Indoor Stadium (capacity ~7k) and got seated 30 minutes before the expected start. There was a surprising number of younger kids/pre-teens along with one or both parents attending. I didn't even consider buying merch as the [prices](https://mediabank.sportshub.com.sg/documents/EDM-library/BLACKPINK2019/BLACKPINK-merch.jpg) were too rich for me. Krunk was also wandering outside the venue earlier and there was a Kia Stinger display with standees of the girls you could take selfies with.

[Here's the view of the stage from our seats.](https://imgur.com/fswPUAM) The stage featured floor to ceiling moving screens serving as a curtain to hide the performers in between songs, play the 2 VCRs, and to provide graphics during the performance. It was amazing to see in person though obviously most of your attention would be directed to the girls. There were also individual elevators at the stage and a group-size elevator platform at the end of the catwalk to provide an exit near the extended stage.

As the time drew closer to the start the monitors started playing Blackpink MVs (never mind that the girls would perform everything being played), and the audience suprisingly [started singing along](https://streamable.com/t7gqw). I tried to note down how many times each MV got played before the concert finally started.

**Blackpink pre-concert MV count:**

MV | Times Played
--|------------
DDDD | 2
Playing With Fire | 1
Boombayah | 1
Stay | 1
Whistle | 1
SOLO | 2
As If It's Your Last | 2

*a Kia Stinger ad also played, but nobody sang along to that.

I didn't take any fancams during the show because our seats were quite far from the stage. The standing pit had security walking around waving No Photo/Videography placards at the Blinks.

When the lights finally turned down the audience went crazy and the band played some generic soaring/bombastic intro music before starting off with the intro to DDDD and the girls rising up from below the stage.

[Singapore Setlist](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/blackpink/2019/singapore-indoor-stadium-singapore-singapore-73955a1d.html)

**Key takeaways/Points of interest**

* Did they sing/rap live? Yes, pretty much. They used handheld microphones instead of the boom mouthpieces (except for Jennie's SOLO). After a few songs the mrs. quietly mentioned to me that Jisoo was underrated as a vocalist. Rose sang great, but at the end (around Boombayah) you could hear her straining at a couple of high notes. Jennie and Lisa spat fire all evening with their raps.

* The girls looked gorgeous, the outfits were cohesive. 

* The individual numbers were good, but I didn't know Rose's medley as it was Korean after the Let It Be part. Everyone slayed nonetheless.

* For Kiss And Make Up they divided up Dua Lipa's lines amongst themselves so everyone sang English lines too. This was pretty good.

* Did they speak English? Yes, even Jisoo (**everybody** cheered her on, including me). No teleprompters onstage but probably rehearsed scripts a little bit. Obligatory local food mention. Notable was Jennie asking Blinks a couple of times to put down their phones during ments. Rose also asked everyone a few times to ""Be safe"", though I couldn't tell what was happening in the pit.

* Choreography changed for Boombayah - no more jumping Jennie.  They were visibly tired after Boombayah though, Jennie bent over for around 30 seconds then had to sit down onstage to catch her breath some more. They legit did the headspinning though, that's definitely hard to do.

* Did they repeat songs? Yes, DDDD and Stay at the encore. To be fair, the DDDD reprise was short plus the girls were playing around (Lisa getting Rose to rap L's lines, fanservice etc.).

* The live band was rocking awesome (each band member had a short solo segment also) and the stage effects/pyrotechnics were over the top. Must've cost a mint to produce, hence the teamup with Kia.

* 2 VCRs - 1st was a Blink tribute compilation of fan performances/messages and the last was a F&amp;F Tokyo Drift-style VCR for the Kia Stinger (the girls drift/race in a parking garage and the tire tracks/skid marks form the letters BP)

* Plenty of stuffed toys thrown onto the stage extension during the encore, as well as a couple of those squeezy bunny ear hats

* Did it feel short? Not really. The pre-encore break was a little long but the energy level was pretty good throughout. No dragging moments at all. Even the fan compilation VCR was amusing (it even had some clips from Singapore Blinks, who were probably over the moon upon seeing the VCR).

Overall, it was very good. I'm not suffering from PCD but I'd definitely go see Blackpink again once they have new songs to perform.",35,86,False,self,,,,,

Now I'll proceed with my question.  I have become a fan of a few different boy groups, but I struggle to find a girl group that I like.  I think that, maybe, part of the problem is the singing style that 90% of groups use -- and some soloists, too.  I have come to called it [Barbie Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhrYis509A) style.  It's somewhat nasal, slightly buzzing, slightly squeaky sort of vocal quality.    Mamamoo, and Girls Generation have less of this quality in their voices.  Red Velvet and Twice have a little more.  It seems to occur more often with soprano voices than alto voices -- but not all sopranos vocalists have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what I'm talking about?  If so, does this vocal quality have a name?  Are they taught to sing this way, or does it come naturally to them?   

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have trouble listening to female voices in Bollywood films but eventually got used to it, especially after understanding that it is specific artistic style that takes them years to learn.  In a similar vein, I'm hoping that I might come to appreciate this vocal quality in kpop girl groups if I learn more about it.  ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I like to use the Wikipedia page list of all k-pop concerts held outside Asia to keep tabs on group activities, but so far I havent been able to find a complete list, especially for concerts happening in Asia like in Singapore or japan. It would also be awesome if it included tv appearances and fanmeets, but that seems like a little to much to ask for haha.

I just love to watch performances, but theres so much going on these days that its hard to keep track of what every group is doing, even if theyre crazy famous.

-SM trainees spotted at NCT's Seoul concert and many believed them to be NCT's new unit or additional members to dream team (note: 4 members of NCT dream will be graduating from the group this year and will be moved to a new group or be added to 127 but that's up to SM so idk what will happen to Jeno, Chenle, and Jaemin)
-Winwin will not return to NCT 127 and will stay with WayV.
-Graduating NCT dream, Chenle (2020) and Renjun (2019) will be added to WayV [*heart breaks* dreamies OT7]

It's only now that I start to realize that NCT's concept is becoming real. Like original dreamies are separating, WayV staying in China (concern. Will we ne able to see all 21 members together? What about Yuta and Winwin, lol?), and new NCT members are expected this year or next year....

""I know all of their faces except this one, so they must be Z"" 

Like the title asks, which group members did you learn by default or process of elimination? 

For instance, I knew everyone in Seventeen except for Wonwoo and Mingyu, so I could always narrow it down to the two of them when I was learning everyone's names. In SHINee, Key was the last one I was able to identify and I always mixed him up with Onew. Kihyun (Monsta X), Jeno, Jaemin, Winwin, Renjun (NCT), and Sungjin (Day6) were other such cases.

I also tended to learn the more 'popular' members first. Do you think this is a natural thing to happen? Which group members did you find to be the most/least recognizable or easy to remember? Which members did you learn first/last in a group and why do you think that is? ",148,75,False,self,,,,,

The highest ranked songs of the past two weeks have been **Favorite's Loca** with a score of 8.87, and __GFriend's Sunrise__ with a score of **9.00**, making that GFriend's first Certified All-Kill and the 15th song overall to get a CAK! Congrats to both Loca and GFriend!

So, here's another million DALLA quesetion  did the itzy bitzy spider climb up the water spout? 

Here's this week's songs!

Here's a quick summary of what to do! Each song this week is up for a music review. Leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep it to the song. Alongside your review, please give the song a score between 1 and 10. 1 being this song is only worth a dalla, and 10 being this song literally went in and mapped your soul! AN [MV] tag means that means the music video can inform your review  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too!

Aside from the obvious Supearls, I am a little upset about the original plan for Blackpink, AKA Pinkpunk, after finding out about it. I love Blackpink and all four members, but Pinkpunk would have been really good, especially since G-IDLE's Miyeon and Euna Kim would have been in it. 

Also, LOONA's brother group, 8x8x8, was supposed to debut last August, but seeing as the notable trainee from ViVi's music video has left, and BBC doesn't seem to have a lot of male trainees (maybe Polaris does but idk), it's probably not happening for a while. BBC did announce them to debut around HaSeul's debut though, and I don't think they knew how wide the gap between the Who's Next Girl era and subunit debuts and the actual group debut would be. Speaking of LOONA, I also really hope BBC/Polaris does something with the blurred girls/trainees that didn't get into LOONA and Go Yujin, like debuting them into Polaris Girls or LOONA's sister group.

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

* All top-level comments MUST be questions.

* All questions MUST be K-pop related.

Anything else is fair game, no matter how trivial or silly.  Remember, you can ask your K-pop questions any day of the week over at r/kpophelp.

I found a discord server which has Korean lessons scheduled on most days of the week (Tuesday \~ Friday and Sunday). The community is really kind and active, many helpful people but the lessons don't have many people attending them. If you're interested, click the link below :)

Also, the server is also going to start a segment called 'K-POP Lyrics Dissection' in which we analyse a paragraph of K-POP lyrics to understand a deeper meaning and to learn Korean Vocabulary in a more interactive way. I'm unsure as to when it will be but it'll probably be once a week.

I'll post what I think about each member:

N- Will renew. Highly likely

Leo- I honestly don't think he'll renew. He looked 100% done since they debuted. I think he'll go for musicals and composing. 

Ken- I'm 50/50 about him. He may take the actor route as well. He is very enthusiastic about being an actor. 

Ravi- Will renew. 

Hongbin- Will renew. But may focus on acting. 

Hyuk- Will renew. 

One thing that bothers me is Jellyfish debuted Verivery (sp? ).  It is a warning sign tbh. They may replace VIXX.

Hongbin said that the agency also decides if they want to keep them or not. 

Well this is my opinion. I'd love to hear you thoughts :)",1,3,False,self,,,,,

**Before the Concert**

* REDMARE in USA was confirmed last year in earlyish November by Subkulture Entertainment and tickets went on sale on December 15th at 10:00 AM. They announced five stops initially, and the one closest to me was the stop at Newarks New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
* Being relatively new to buying tickets on Ticketmaster, I had my family assist me in the process -- we had about nine devices set up in total, with each family member managing two or three devices at a time. The waiting room opened about 30 minutes before the tickets officially went on sale, and in the waiting room we were randomly assigned a spot in line. This was probably one of the most hectic ticketing experiences Ive been through, since around 6 out of 9 of my devices showed a queue of 2000+ people ahead. Only one of my devices actually made it through the queue before every ticket was sold out.
* The Newark stop was the last one and sold out in about 20 minutes, which was pretty impressive. The girls did a great job all around when it came out to selling tickets -- three dates were completely sold out, and an extra day was added to the LA stop. Im assuming an extra day would have been added to the Newark stop if Redmare in Canada wasnt happening immediately after.
* I was planning on buying P1 tickets for the Red Velvet show initially for $200 before service fees, etc., but because everything sold out quickly, I ended up scoring P2 tickets for around $173 before fees (they were originally priced at $169, but the prices kept changing due to high demand. After fees, they ended up being $201)
* Our seats were in ORCHL, Row U, which on a map looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/3ZJYEbT) but in real life looks like [**this**](https://imgur.com/a/mgaIUgl). The venues capacity was about 2.8K -- if youre curious about what the venue looked like, you can find virtual tours [here](https://www.njpac.org/host-an-event/prudential-hall). 
* There were no high-touches/photo opportunities for this tour, unfortunately :/
* Around the beginning of January, the girls gave us a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsbF-vKAnHn/) regarding their upcoming tour!

**Day of the Concert**

* The entire day was unfortunately not dedicated to getting prepared and going to the concert. I had volunteering duties elsewhere for a couple of hours, but I left around 20 minutes early to get prepared. It was a 45 minute drive to the venue  I live decently close to Newark, so a lot of concerts are in close proximity  and I got there at around 5:00, so a good thirty minutes before doors were supposed to officially open. The doors really opened at around 6, though. 
* While waiting in line, a fan came around and handed out banners for us to raise during the encore. They really did a good job of making sure everyone got it, coming around several times and asking everyone persistently.
* They played several VCRs prior to the concert, I thought they were going to be boring time-fillers, but I actually thoroughly enjoyed all of them. A VCR that stood out to me was the one they played before Bad Boy + Peekaboo + Really Bad Boy + Rookie  it was basically the girls going through a haunted house, but it was filmed well and when coupled with the bass-boosted bgm, it was really powerful. 
* They played a couple of songs beforehand while everyone was waiting, some of which were Something Kinda Crazy, Cool World, Dont U Wait No More, and Ice Cream Cake. Ice Cream Cake was notable because everyone sang along with the I scream, you scream, gimme that gimme that ice cream part. Otherwise, people were mostly just talking and waiting for the concert to begin. 
* The concert started exactly on time. Russian Roulette came on and everyone went absolutely crazy. There wasnt too much singing along with this one probably because the songs mostly in Korean, but there was a lot of incoherent screaming every time a member had a solo part. 
* Next came Power Up, and everyone sang along to the banana part after the first chorus. When Irene, Wendy, and Joy did the little rap section near the bridge of the song, people screamed the most, myself included. I feel like people were more hyped up for Power Up than Russian Roulette, so maybe Power Up wasnt as polarizing as people thought it was. 
* After Power Up they took a little break and talked to us! They talked about how being at the concert was like a theme park. I couldnt understand much of what they were saying because everyone was screaming, so I mainly focused on how they looked and their little actions etc. Something I noticed was that theyre not actually as skinny as they look like on TV, especially Joy. Also, theyre prettier than on TV, no camera will do them justice. 
* After Power Up I can't remember if there was a VCR or anything, but I do know that the next song performed was My Second Date. They all did their own solo dances to a remixed version. Seulgis solo dance got the most positive reaction, but Yeris solo dance was pretty well-received too. I think if you watch clips of Yeris solo dance its easy to understand why. 
* The next song was Mosquito! This was their first badass kinda song on their set list, so it was also received pretty well. People were especially hyped during Seulgis rap parts, which was expected. 
* After Mosquito was Look  since this song is mostly in Korean, it was hard for people to sing along too and was maybe one of the least hyped songs in the entire set list. The most cheers were during the part where they did the Backpack kid dance lmao
* A VCR played after Mosquito, and all the girls turned from animals into humans, foreshadowing Mr. E and Zoo coming next. When Mr. E began, all the backup dancers came out wearing hunter costumes and pretended to hunt the girls, who were all dressed up in different animal costumes. It was overall really cute and enjoyable. It was also during this part that I realized that the girls were singing live, because I could hear Wendy breathing hard against her mic while singing. Also, Wendy and Joy has a lot of adlibs in Mr. E and they sounded amazing. 
* Happiness came after Zoo. The most exciting part was predictably Wendys little shine on me part near the end. This was one of the few times during the concert I actually heard Wendy getting hyped up by the audience  it was mostly Seulgi and Irene getting the loud cheers. Also, I noticed Yeri in the center for a lot of Wendys parts, so I wasnt sure whether Yeri was supposed to be singing since I was really only hearing Wendy sing. 
* Next came Lucky Girl + Bad Dracula. Lucky Girl was cut a little short  Im not sure which part of Lucky Girl was cut, but I did notice that it was shorter than usual. Bad Dracula was one of the least hyped songs in the concert along with Look, which made me sad because Bad Dracula is one of their best songs. 
* All Right was next. The girls had baskets and threw little signed balls into the audience, but it really only reached the first six or seven rows. I was in the 20th row so I had no chance of getting any of them unfortunately, so Im jealous of everyone who managed to get one. Also, a lot of people sang along to this song during the chorus, which I was actually surprised by! All Right was a B-side I listened to a couple of times when it came out and immediately forgot about. 
* Then came Blue Lemonade. Blue Lemonade is my all-time favorite song from Red Velvet, so I was especially excited for this one. Their voices were really surreal and soft and I loved the entire performance so much, they really did my favorite song justice. I also went absolutely crazy every time Joy or any other member raised their hand and formed it kind of into a paw during the pop pop pop part (sorry, that was a terrible description, but maybe someone will understand what Im referring to). 
* Next was About Love! A lot of people sat down for About Love and I strangely dont remember much about it, which I feel bad about. I do remember us all waving our lightsticks from side to side though. 
* Moonlight Melody was next! I managed to get a good recording of it [**here**](https://imgur.com/a/0PBkmMa) if anyones curious. Again, for this song, people mostly sat down and werent as loud as usual. People took this opportunity to yell their love for Red Velvet, which became somewhat annoying because I was trying to hear them sing. 
* Next came Bad Boy english version. This song had the loudest cheers of the entire night. Everyone sang along throughout the entire song, although the loudest parts were predictably during the chorus. I have a short recording of the end [**here**](https://imgur.com/a/nVMwaIa)**.** 
* After Bad Boy was Peekaboo. People screamed really loudly for this one as well. 
* Then came RBB! They had a little talking segment before RBB where they talked about how they prepared a song for us in English and how it was their first performance of this version ever (which is untrue but whatever lmao)
* Rookie was the last official song of the day, so it got a lot of cheers. I noticed that everyone around me who was singing along was singing Lookie instead of Rookie, which I found cute. 
* After Rookie, I think they left the stage. At this point, everyone started yelling Red Velvet! Red Velvet! repeatedly. Then the screen at the front turned black and everyone got excited, thinking the girls were coming back on stage again. It was actually another VCR. After the VCR was over the girls came back on stage and began performing Day 1. 
* Day 1 is such a good song for an encore. During Day 1, we all raised our banners that said Red Velvet  luvies, we are the closest in the world. Maybe I missed something, but Im not sure if they actually acknowledged the banners. 
* At some point, Im not sure whether it was before or after the encore, the girls held a really long talking segment. First up was Joy, who gave a really long monologue about how this was the last stop of the tour and how they were happy to hold a tour of this scale and how happy it made her to be able to see us like this. Of all of the members, I liked her monologue the best because it was really meaningful. 
* Next came Wendy, who said some of the same things as Joy and also said I dont think I can ever forget this night which made me think that I felt the same way too. 
* After Wendy came Yeri, who was realllllyy cute. She spoke mostly in English but sometimes I couldnt understand what she  was saying, maybe because people were being so loud. 
* After Yeri was Seulgi, and I think Seulgi got the loudest cheers of the night. For a full straight minute, people were yelling and cheering while Seulgi blushed. Anyway, she also talked about how this was the last stop, etc. 
* I have the most to say about Irenes segment. She was incredibly cute but visibly tired I think. Irene was talking about how everyone filled her with joy, at which point Joy started laughing and it was my favorite part of the entire night. Another time while she was talking, I think another member interrupted her. This confused Irene so she kept saying what? what? over and over again because she forgot what she was saying. She had the cutest, confused look on her face when she was talking. I think it was during this segment where Irene also said now *this* is really really the last song (in reference to Red Flavor).
* Also, at some point throughout the concert, a fan was waving a Reeve that they had made out of cardboard. Seulgi took it from them and showed it to everyone, and I think it was Joy who even put on the Robot head. Seulgi talked about how she was the one who designed Reeve and how it looked much better than what she originally designed it to look like. She also mentioned how Yeri was the one who gave it the name Reeve. 
* Anyway, after Day 1 came Red Flavor, the last song of the night. I dont have much to say about this, except that I felt that it was a really good ending to the concert. 

**Some Notable Things/Moments** 

* I noticed that a majority of the audience was in their 20s, which I was surprised by since I was expecting most of the audience to be teenagers. Some people brought their families along as well.
* There was one person who brought along a Blackpink lightstick, which I was kind of confused by but kind of appreciated because at least they were showing their support somehow?
* There was a person holding up a sign that said Lesbians for Wendy on one side and Lesbians for Red Velvet on the other. Not sure if the girls noticed the sign though. 
* All of the songs and all of their voices sounded a bit higher than usual, which might have had to do with the acoustics of the place.
* There was this random ooh ooh ooh sound that kept appearing at random times. Irene even acknowledged it, which made everyone laugh
* If you made it this far, thank you! :)

Recently I've been thinking a lot about survival shows as a whole. No matter what the final lineup is someone always ends up being disappointed that their fave(s) didn't make the cut, or end up being upset about how the group as a whole turned out.

One of my biggest survival show disappointments was during NO MERCY, Monsta X's survival show. The title isn't an exaggeration; the show was brutal. But one of the hardest parts was when fan favorite rapper #Gun didn't make the group. It was shocking and honestly pretty upsetting.

Looking back on it now, it's still sad. At the same time I think it was ultimately the right decision. While I really enjoy Gun as a rapper, I don't think that he'd fit into what their overall concept has become. If he'd been included, I think their concept would have stayed more hiphop oriented instead of developing into what it is today. I love Monsta X as they are now and can't imagine them any other way. 

On the other hand I have a longstanding love hate relationship with the Produce series and I still have mixed feelings about YG Treasure Box's outcome. I don't know, maybe I just enjoy suffering.

So what are some times where you've been unhappy about how things turned out on a survival show? And looking back on it objectively, do you think it was ultimately a good thing someone wasn't included in the group? If they had made it, how would their presence have impacted said group? Would things be similar to how they are now, or would the group have gone in an entirely different direction?",110,71,False,self,,,,,

Which groups that have disbanded or split in the past do you think if they debut now would be big?
My pick would be Beast and I know they were big while they were active (and that they are now Highlight) but I think they would have found major success in 2019.
Their music honestly isn't too different from what we hear nowadays and I believe a lot of their bops (Fiction being my favorite) even though they are 8 or so years old have aged well and still hold up.
Also they are very talented dancers and their choreos have been fun and creative.  So yeah I think kpop fans now would defiantly appreciate that.

2137,kpop,t5_2r1ox,2019-2-19,2019,2,19,17,as8cck,self.kpop,What happened with CL's US career? Here is my analasys/opinion. (Spoiler: It is not all YG's fault),https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/as8cck/what_happened_with_cls_us_career_here_is_my/,OriginalPromise,1550566378,"So CL, the ""ex-YG Princess"", and my first and ultimate bias, announced her US debut on 2014. There were tons of articles flooding out announcing her big US debut, with her colab with Diplo, and her signing with Scooter Braun. On paper, she had everything. She had fat financial support from YG, big name collaberations with Diplo and connections in the US with will.i.am, and top-grade management from Scooter Braun. But why are we still waiting for a damned album 4 (now almost 5) years later? With recent news that BOM is coming back (yay!) and me revisiting 2NE1 due to the news, lets talk about this. Before we get there, here is what I think.  


**\*These are my opinions and you are free to disagree and debate. Some of the info here are also my educated specualtion from actual sources\***  


1.Scooter Braun didn't do shit.

I believe that he never actively supported CL. He was too busy jerking off Ariana Grande and Bieber and other money makers within his arsenal . For example, SB never promoted her US tour, didn't support her make-up endorsements, didn't say a word for the *My Little Pony* OST, didn't have a clue about CL's big Olympic performance, etc. If you actually think about it, most of the US activities were set up by YG, starting from *Hello Bitches* to *Lifted*. If you go on iTunes and look up the publisher for *Lifted*, it's not ""Schoolboy Records"", SB's label. It's actually YG, and soley YG. Who paid for Paris Goebel and her crew? YG did. Who paid for the Lifted video and studio time, and promotions? YG did. Who paid for all the studio times for the crap ton of songs that she recorded, and music videos that she shot that never got released to the public? YG did. Am I saying that SB had nothing to do with CL and didn't do anything for her? No. I can still see his name and affiliation listed in the credits, and can see the ties between her work and his connections (ex. Paris Goebel's crew was also in JB's Sorry video). But did he do EVERYTHING that he can? Hell no. Compared to the amount of effort and time that went into JB's album, or Ariana's ventures, CL got nothing.

1.1. Scooter said that it was YG's fault and that YG was too controlling but I think it's a big fat lie

SB never mentioned anything about CL on his twitter. If he did, it was because of CL's dedicated fans spamming him to get his attention. But when the news broke out that CL is no longer working with SB, SB decides to ""conveniently"" talk with a fan and have him [leak the convo](https://www.kpopmap.com/conversation-between-cl-and-scooter-braun-suggests-she-is-being-held-back/). Bullshit. He never talked about her activites or cared about them while actively promoting Grande and Bieber, and when her contract is up and getting heat from fans, he decides to talk to one fan and have him convinently ""leak"" the convo. He makes all this press about how she's signed under him and is going to do wonders for her career, then when the apple finally hits the ground, he tells starved fans that YG was too controlling when you already published some of her work under your label? I think this was genius on his part because he kept fans starved about anything related to CL, and finally ended up throwing a bone to crazy fans to conver his ass after taking all the money from YG while doing nothing for CL. CL and Scooter also ""agreed"" that it was all YG's fault, but I think that was CL just putting blind faith in SB and kissing ass that he is going to do something for her one day, when he never will; like he did with PSY's career, or The Wanted and drove that group into the ground; angering YG and drowning his name in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2.  YG doesn't think CL is able to recoup investment costs

This is pretty self explanitory. YG poured a crap ton of resources into CL's debut. But once *Lifted* launched, it performed badly. It wasn't recieved well in the US with ""only"" 29 million views at the time of writing. So put yourself in YG's shoes. We  can all agree that he's a greedy money hoe, but you invest all this money, time, and effort into CL's debut, but fail to see money coming in. Why would you want to pour more time and effort into what already turned out to be a poor performer? Look at BTS or Blackpink. Did Big Hit and YG push BTS and BP the same way that they did with CL? No, yet they are recieving better reactions and ticket sales. (They didn't even formally ""debut"" yet)  YG saw CL's debut to be a failure and didn't see it getting better, so he stepped out; which I think is totally reasonable.There was a song called *All In* that she leaked*,* and also a *Hello Bitches* music video that never got released. He deems CL to be too risky of an investment, thus discontinuing his support for her US activities, which explains CL getting frustrated with YG and the drama caused within. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. CL is too keen on wanting a career in the US, despite a strong fanbase in Asia, costing 2NE1 in the process indirectly

So CL grew up in the US, and I think that the following life experience pressures her to persue a US debut. Korea was always a foregin country to her, and I think she wants to be regcognized at where she can call home. Despite having a strong career in Asia, she decided to persue a US career in 2014, before BTS's success and when Korean artists finding success in the US market was basically unheard of, except for PSY being the outlier. This decision indirectly costed 2NE1 their livelihood, and put their activities on hold. Now Bom's scandal is the main catalyst that forced 2NE1's long hitatus, but I believe CL's debut plans also caused some delays and eventually contributed to the cancelation of 2NE1's comeback, after Minzy left. I think she decided that her success and fame in asia is not enough for her. Why else would she leave a market where she is already respected and immensely successful in, to a market that no other Korean artist was able to penetrate? She mentioned in an [interview](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/11/cl-sheds-tears-while-talking-about-her-advancement-in-america) that she would never quit until she eventually breaks into the American market. In that interview, Taeyang also urges CL to come back to the Korean market, but she stubbornly tells him that she is determined to have a career in the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Opinion: I can personally get behind her dreams and aspirations and it is understandable where it comes from, but I think she needs to be realistic. Statistically, the odds were never in her favor, and now that she has bad blood with YG, I don't see any of the music and projects that she did with YG being released any time soon, and I also think that YG is the only company that could've and was willing to support CL to this caliber. What other company is going to able to back CL? SM, after they failed with BoA? JYP after they failed with Wonder Girls? Smaller companies that lacks resources to even promote idols in the same caliber as the big 3?  

I rediscovered CL when I heard of BOM's comeback. 2NE1 was the group that ultimately brought me into K-pop, and also the only group that had a killer stage presence that I think modern groups lack. (Not saying that modern releases suck) And the more I re-read the tweets, her comments in interviews, and think about the situation logically, I personally don't see a one-size-fits-all answer for CL. Many people tend to just scapegoat YG, including CL and SB, but I really don't think that's the case. I think CL landed here in the shitty situation she is in because of all three parties involved, including her.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is an **opinion**. Feel free to disagree and reflect on it, and I did specualte to fill in the missing pieces. Not everything may be factual and this is my **opinion**. Please be respectful in the comments as I know this is a sensitive issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for coming to my long ass ted talk.

A bunch of pastel coloured plain backgrounds and rooms with similarly bland coloured objects in them.

So many MVs have this tumblr aesthetic vibe and while I do think they're nice to look at, it's over done and honestly boring af. I'd rather they just film in some interesting locations like 9Muses with shipping containers in Hurt Locker or if they really wanna be aesthetically pleasing just film it in a beautiful location like Mamamoo's Starry Night or Taeyeon's I.

If you're not gonna have some storyline for the MV then at least have some interesting/dynamic sets for me to look at.

 On 20th, Narcissus showcase was held at K-Art Hall in Olympic Park for celebrating SF9's 6th mini album. 

During the showcase, each member talked more about other teammates than themselves, showing their love for their team. 

 Rowoon answered for the question if he has a goal he wants to achieve: ""I posted an announcement on our group conversation(of his team); it includes the goal of SF9, fan community member size, fan meeting and concert objectives. I think if we imagine, it can become true. I wanted to get 189cm tall in my childhood and drew a line on the wall and measured my height everyday and now I am 189cm tall. In the past, I thought it would be great if our fan community size reaches 5000, now it's 8000. So I believe we will achieve the 1st on the music TV show rank.   


&amp;#x200B;

Chan-Hee got lots of attention after starring the drama ""SKY Castle."" He couldn't afford the time to practice dance much because of the drama shooting schedule. In-Seong said Chan-Hee learned everything in a week, and now he can dance better than any of us, showing affection to his team mate. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rown said ""From the debut, I got more help than others in a team and given more opportunity. However, SF9's members all have unique characteristics, I felt sorry since they would have been better off if they were given the same opportunities like I was""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The title song ""Don't become pretty"" is a song where EDM, Ragae, Trap were all mixed. In the lyrics, ""you"" refers to the narrator's other ego, meaning the mature self-esteem saying ""don't try to become prettier since you are beautiful as who you are now""

###Pre-Concert

Hi everyone, I'm exhausted still but the post-concert withdrawal is kicking in super hard and I really want to relive the concert by talking about it so here we go...

I work a little outside of Toronto so I took transit (got off at the wrong stop l o l) to get to Coca Cola Coliseum, and got there a little before 6:30 when the doors were supposed to open.  I had preordered a light stick, so I was sent straight inside to the merch pick up station.  The people working there were having a little game, trying to guess what my order was based solely off how much I paid, which really isn't super important in the whole grand scheme of the concert but I thought it was pretty funny.  I'm glad I ordered a lightstick ahead of time, I overheard from someone else there that everything official sold out (of course there were scalpers selling Ts and other assorted merchandise if you REALLY wanted something and didn't go ahead of time).

A lot of others have talked about the diversity in the lineup and crowd, but even after reading that I was pretty surprised. Ratio wise, it looked nearly 50/50 for male to female, *maybe*  slightly leaning towards female, because its RV lol.  But, befitting of Toronto's diversity, I saw tons of different races, ages, etc.  A lot of people came as big massive groups, how they got their hands on tickets all together is beyond me, I saw a couple of younger kids with their parents, which was pretty sweet, but I also so a lot of solo goers too!  Just being in the crowd was something else. I only got into kpop a couple of months ago and to be so lucky to have one of my favourite groups come here and be able to be surrounded by others who love them as much as I do was incredible.  Toronto has a large Korean population so there were many either international students or Korean Canadians. You could definitely tell them apart in the crowd because they laughed and reacted to things the members said well before the translator finished talking, which i thought was hilarious and cool.

Anyways, they finally opened the doors a little after 7, and almost right after we got seated ([my view](https://imgur.com/ANNWmZK)), staff or a fan group, I honestly don't know who, began handing out [little](https://imgur.com/ANNWmZK) [signs](https://imgur.com/PYigwa4) that we were to hold up during the first encore.  I think it was solely a fan thing, which is some serious dedication, hats off to whoever organized it, it was prolly pretty expensive, especially since EVERYONE in the crowd got one, and there were still tons to go around.  After the signs, I stepped out to get some water for my friend and I (9 bucks for two, really??) but that was a mistake.  I soon as I stepped out of the arena, the crowd started to scream.  Apparently, either Joy or Irene had stuck their head out off one of the executive boxes up near the top of the arena and waved.  I'm not saying that water wasn't worth it but, it wasn't worth it.  

The rest of the waiting was just accompanied by RV music, an incredible cosplay of their Dumb Dumb doll costume, and then finally the music stopped, the videos changed and the screams began...

---

###The Concert

Same setlist as the previous Redmare in USA concerts, they started with a video introducing the theme park theme (I thought they had closed down Disney World just for themselves LOL), then went straight into Russian Roulette.  By now, the screams were deafening.  As I said before I haven't been to a concert before, let alone a kpop one, but all I know is that people were excited, including myself.  I'm a pretty shy guy, but the energy really just sucks you in, and next thing I knew I was screaming too.  The cheering for Wendy was especially loud, we love our hometown hero and we really showed it tonight, especially in that first song.  Irene or Seulgi probably got the second most.

After RR, they moved into Power Up, which was also really exciting, seeing as it was one of the songs that got me into RV in the first place.  Last night is still a blur to me, so this could've happened sometime else, but both Seulgi and Joy were super into the song and crowd, waving whenever they had a quick break in choreo.  The crowd also did the fanchant for the song, as well as for Bad Boy and half of RBB, but that one kinda fizzled out when we got to Son Seungwan lol

Their first ment was next, where they did their intros and naturally the crowd went bananas for Wendy.  It seemed like a pretty standard intro, I pretty sure it was scripted as they looked like they were reading off of something and Irene definitely slipped up and said ""We're glad you could join us in [insert location here]"" before she quickly corrected herself"" which was absolutely hilarious.  I didn't mind it being scripted though, especially since I know outside of Wendy and Yeri the members don't speak English, so it helped them. It was a little hard to understand them sometimes, but we cheered them on anytime they said something anyways.

They moved on to dance solos after, and this is probably the only part i was a little disappointed.  They were incredible dancing, but I wish we could've gotten a *little* more time with the song, because I love my Second Date and with their solo dances, because I love Seulgi dancing.  

Next was Mosquito, which was a song that really took some time to grow on me, but between the live experience and the performance I found myself finding a new appreciation for the song. I'm just now realizing how long this is so I'm going to zoom through the rest and highlight everything else.

The use of the VCRs throughout the concert was pretty cool, giving them a chance to change costumes and the stagehands to help set up the sets as well as provide us with some videos that although I didn't really 100% know wth was going in some of them, I enjoyed (especially evil Irene).  

Some of the standout performances were definitely Happiness, ESPECIALLY during Wendy's Shine on Me moment.  This was one of the moments I knew I had to film because I could feel everyone gettting ready to lose their minds and lo and behold they did.  The cheering, her god-like highnotes... I don't think I've ever experienced noise and energy like that before. 

Cheers were especially loud during the intro VCR for Peek-a-Boo/Bad Boy because it marked a shift to more Velvet music, which I understand why it wasn't featured as much, but still wish we got more.  

The talking segments after the first one seemed less scripted but still in English!  They talked briefly about what Toronto was famous for, and of course everyone yelled Wendy and the CN Tower. Seulgi seemed disappointed that she couldn't see the Niagara Falls, but I'm hoping after Vancouver, they can take a break and maybe do a Level Up S4 here!

---

###WENDY


Probably the most memorable part of the night was after the encore (which they really made us work for, we were cheering for them to come back out, even though we knew they would, for like 5 min straight) was the ending ""sharing feelings time"" as Wendy called it.  This was her first concert home, and I think her first time home in 7 years, so it was a whole mess of emotions, crying, cheering, birthday celebrations and more crying.  

They played rock paper scissors to see who would talk first, of course excluding Wendy so she could have the spotlight at the end.  There was a translator off stage to help them, since this was mostly in Korean, hats off to her she did an amazing job.  Again, this was last night and it was all a blur, but I'm 99% sure it was this order lol.  Joy ended up going first, and she started crying pretty quickly, talking about how glad she was the Wendy was able to come home and perform on homesoil.  She stopped herself soon after, saying ""she didn't know why she was crying, she wasn't even Wendy's mom"" LOL.  

Seulgi was next and she as even worse than Joy. In all honesty, I wasn't sure she was going to make it through, she was crying so hard.  It was pretty similar to Joy's thanking the crowd for being so amazing, and being grateful that Wendy was able to come home and perform in front of her friends and family, something that she couldn't do back in Korea but Seulgi took for granted (her words).  She also led multiple ""scream for us moments"" as well as a touching happy birthday for Wendy. 

Yeri's was a little generic, but she seemed super tired and she did hers completely in English, which I loved to see. I knew she was the second best English speaker by default, but I didn't know she was that good!  Irene thanked the crowd and talked about how cold Canada was, saying Wendy had a super warm heart and lent her jacket to the members who were cold.

Wendy rounded off the first set of ments with my favourite part of the night (I'll link these fancams from Twitter later so you can watch and cry along).  Here she thanked the crowd said everyone she loved was here, from her family, her high school friends and even one of her teachers.  She told her mom to stop crying, even though she was shedding tears faster than Niagara falls.  Much like my experience, she said she was super overwhelmed and it felt like a dream.  She said she'll never forget this moment and honestly, neither will I.  I've lived away from home and missed holidays, but I can't imagine leaving at her age, overseas to a country she's pretty unfamiliar with.  I have a renewed appreciation for Wendy after this.  Also, her English sounded even better than usual! Being in an English speaking country for even 2 week can really help :)

Joy surprisingly decided to talk again, asking the crowd if she could say something spontaneous, which of course we all agreed.  She talked about the culture shock that Wendy went through, how energetic she was when they first met and how she wasn't sure if they could be friends.  The most heartbreaking part was when Joy talked about how Wendy would stay back at the dorms during Korean holidays and they would all go home.  Joy really broke down here, ending it with an i love you.  

After everyone was done crying their eyes out and leading one last WENDY cheer, Irene closed the concert with ""this is really our last song"" and a great performance of Red Flavour.  They stayed on stage after to take some pictures, cheer and dance around on stage and wave at the crowed (it was here that I realized just how tiny Irene is :o). 

All in all, I talk too much.  But seriously, I'm still buzzing the morning after, this was an experience I'm not going to forget any time soon and I'm so glad I went.

The Redmare tour actually came north and Canadian reveluvs had an amazing opportunity to see Red Velvet live. I attended the Toronto date last night and it was unforgettable! The show was fun, full of emotions (both laughter and tears), and altogether much much too short as time seemed to fly by.

The venue was the Coca-Cola Coliseum, home of the AHL team the Toronto Marlies, so not the highest capacity but the size did give everyone very good views, even for the P4 tickets. Ticketing was a nightmare. I watched P1 tickets sell out, come back, sell out again, etc. By the 3 hour mark I was just frantically trying to purchase any tickets I could as this was a show I could not miss out on. In the end snagged 2 P2 seats and a P1 seat as well.

The day of the show the temperature around Toronto was not too bad but the wind was biting. I felt a little bad for the RV girls who had just come from Miami and now were surely freezing. Luckily entry line-up was inside the building so me and my friends did the majority of waiting inside. I had pre-ordered merch beforehand and the pick-up was quick and simple. Bought 3 shirts (for me, my girlfriend, and brother), and the RV lightstick. 

Concert started shortly after 8 and when the lights dimmed the whole crowd roared with excitement. The girls started off with Russian Roulette then into Power Up and what a 1-2 punch! The energy the girls had was undeniably contagious, as they performed in their cute girl scout outfits. Then there was a little remix of My Second Date where each girl had a solo dance break. Yeri's vogue dance section was to die for, but then when Seulgi did her thing at the end I was so amazed, her charisma and power as a dancer are top tier.

Throughout the show there was little speaking moments and the RV girls (Joy, Yeri, Seulgi, and Irene) did their best speaking english which was so adorable, Yeri's and Joy's english in particular impressed me, but they all did their best to communicate with us. My absolute favorite section of the concert was when they performed their ""velvet"" songs, a trio of Bad Boy (eng. version), Peek-a-boo, and RBB (eng. version). Bad Boy is one of my favorite k-pop songs ever and was the song that made me a RV fan (and bias Joy) so to see it live was a dream come true. When the iconic ""who dat, who dat..."" line started the whole crowd screamed ""boy"" instead of ""is"" and it made me laugh a little.

The ending ment during the encore will always be something I remember and cherish. Wendy for a time grew up and went to school here in Toronto and of course we welcomed her and the girls like it was a homecoming. Joy and Seulgi, fighting through tears, gave very heartfelt ments about how amazing Wendy is and how much it meant to them to be able to come back and perform in front of Wendy's family and friends and reveluvs too! Wendy even said she could see her mom crying in the crowd. Then one of the members asked us if we could sing happy birthday for Wendy as it would be her birthday in two days, of course we were happy to. I bet there was not a single dry eye at the concert, I certainly did not expect to cry myself. Despite how short of a time Wendy was here in Toronto, I hope she knows that she can always call Canada home too.

Before I knew it the final song Red Flavor was over and the show ended, but it is a moment I won't soon forget.",12,168,False,spoiler,,,,,

Forgive me if I mix some things up or forget some things because I'm still processing.

So RV is probably my favourite active girl group of this day and age. Therefore, I've been waiting for this day for so long and now it has commeth and gone. Grabbed two P2 tickets for me and my cousin the day they came out (after initially thinking they were sold out because ticketmaster waiting pages suck). Pre-ordered the lightstick 15 minutes before the deadline because hey why not?

#Prior to concert:
Nothing extraordinary really. Cousin and I went to AYCE sushi for an early dinner so that we didn't have to worry about food later on. Left a little after 6 to catch the 6:34 train to the Exhibition stop (where the venue was). Train arrives and, OF COURSE, we had to wait for a signal change. Didn't happen for about 15 minutes, but hey at least this was an early train. Get to Exhibition, and there is a huge lineup to get inside which was weird to me because I've gone to quite a few wrestling shows in the same venue and usually just waltz on in, but nevertheless. we got there and there were two lines (one going left and another going straight). There was a sign indicating Merchandise Pre-orders, but no arrow or indication for which line it was. Eventually I deduced that it was the straight line because I saw the tables inside. Finally got my lightstick and went on inside. Got to our seats and we got our [banners for the night](https://imgur.com/a/Egtpn1m). It says, ""We've been waiting, our happiness"" and we were instructed to raise them during the 1st encore song (spoilers much?). Concert was supposed to start at 8, but probably didn't start like 8:20. Right before the start, they started blasting Something Kinda Crazy which everyone started jamming to with their lightsticks (including me).

#Main Setlist:
Opening VCR - RV goes to a theme park (not Wonderland sadly), have a blast, they meet some robot, then Thanos snapped his fingers on Wakanda off-screen and all of RV fades. We are the parallel universe.

Russian Roulette - Crowd goes wild once they stepped on stage and they start with one of my all time favourite RV songs. I'm pretty much yell-singing the whole time because I'm so amped. Everyone got cheered pretty loudly when it was their turn... and then Wendy started singing her part. Crowd loses their mind. The hometown is all in for the hometown girl.Vocals on point, dancing on point, performance game is ON POINT. That was a fantastic way to start the show.

Power Up - Crowd went just as Ba Banana Ba ba banana nanas for this song. Wendy continued to get big cheers everytime she graced us with her voice. The Go Go Airplane part was LOUD.

1st talk segment - Introductions of course. Everyone gets cheered of course. Hometown girl makes everyone go ballistic of course. More or less just a welcoming segment going off the opening VCR how they started from a theme park and now they here. A weird thing I noticed (and other attendees, please tell me if you noticed this too), it seemed like Joy and Yeri's mic was set a pitch too high. I thought I was just being delirious from how hard I went for the first couple of songs, but it seemed to have persisted for a bit until they finally fixed it later in the show. Also at this point, I had to pass my lightstick to my cousin because my arm was exhausted from jamming so hard even though it was only the first 2 songs. We ended up just alternating between talk segments.

My Second Date (Solo dance, remix) - I actually only just remembered this song recently because it came up on shuffle randomly, but I'm glad I did because the members danced their butts off for this song individually. I can't really pinpoint the standout because they were all great. The dancers were also fantastic.

Mosquito - AH WOO! Nothing more.

Look - A pretty nice cooldown from all the crazy energetic songs they've been doing so far. Very nice to hear live given its unique, retro instrumentals.

First VCR - RV individually found an animal. They enter some carriage and off-screen, somebody used polymerization to fuse the respective animal with the girls. Suddenly, some hunters come about, chase the girls, and eventually corner everyone but Joy. Joy eludes them somehow and then black screen.

Mr. E - And now RV are in animal costumes. They all look adorable. Even the dancers with their hunter outfits looked great. The whole hunting dynamic as the chereography was cool to see.

Zoo - So glad to have heard this song live. It's really really good.

Happiness - BOOYAH. THE CROWD EXPLODED WHEN THIS CAME ON. I've known RV since debut so this was the first song I ever heard by them and I can't believe I never realized how much I needed to hear this song live with a crowd. You don't know what hype feels like until you have a filled audience yell ""HAPPINESS"" at the time. Wendy nailed her solo part and it was amazing.

Hit That Drum - I love this song a lot so I got amped for this one. The way they danced when they said boom boom hit that drum was pumped full of energy and I loved it.

2nd VCR - 
Lucky Girl - Kinda bummed that they didn't do the whole song because this is one of my favourite RV songs given its very showgirls-like vibe, but I loved every second of it. They also wore these really colourful dresses which looked awesome.

Bad Dracula - And right onto the next song on the Russian Roulette album. More Lalalas to go around.

All Right - The Red Velvet nation attacked. They took out their baskets and started throwing candy to everyone near the front. I found it funny how they had to put down the baskets every time the chorus came about and some rushed to do so (looking at you Kim Yerim), but it's All Right ALL RIGHT.

2nd Talk Segment - This was a more personal talk segment talking about Toronto. **THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GO TO WENDY'S HOUSE** due to time cosntraints which lowkey bummed me out (but all the more reason to come back). I believe Irene or Seulgi mentioned that they wanted to visit Niagara Falls, but again couldn't due to time. Irene mentioned how cold Canada was (even this night was cold af) and how Wendy always gave them her jackets (bless her motherly heart).

Blue Lemonade - Nothing less of another wonderful performance.

About Love - From Blue Lemonade, we go more chill with this song which was such a nice vibe. 

Moonlight Melody - They all look stunning just standing there and singing beautifully. I'm mad that my angle obstructed the right-most part of the stage so I couldn't see my girl Seulgi. I wish this was the last song given what happens later in the encore talk.

3rd VCR - THEY'RE WEARING BLACK AND GOT GIRL CRUSH GOING HELL YEAH. They're in a haunted house where everything's spooking them and scares all around. 

Ice Cream Cake (Intro) - Going off the haunted house VCR, they did a robotic-like dance using a rather creepy version of Ice Cream Cake with the Lala lalala. 

Bad Boy (English version) - WHO THAT WHO THAT WHO THAT ~~IS~~ BOY. Seeing Seulgi do her point dance in the chorus in her outfit was OOOF GIRL YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO ME. Couldn't stop myself dancing to this one.

Peek-a-Boo - From one favourite song to another all-time favourite. I, again, couldn't control myself dancing to this song because the chereography is so amazing to see live.

3rd Talk Segment - They went off from the previous VCR asking if the haunted house was scary. Yeri asked who we thought would be the most scared in a haunted house. I immediately said, ""You probably."" Seulgi said she thinks Irene would be the most scared which surprised me honestly, although maybe that chic deadpan look she has is all a facade. Yeri then mentions that they were gonna perform a certain song in English for the first time which ended up being...

RBB (Really Bad Boy) (English version) - Oh yes, this song is such a blast to hear live. You bet I sang along (or at least my version of singing which is pure cringe). MR BAAAAAD BOY.

Rookie - What a catchy, pumping song to ""finish"" with.  

#Encore:
Encore VCR - Everything was a dream. Irene was the mastermind of everything (the hunters, the drinks, and the haunted house). Bae Joo-hyun evil smirks while everyone else is puzzled as they walk out of the park. 

Day 1 - Out comes the banners. They all come out wearing the concert shirts and casual outfits. Seulgi immediately catches my eye again with hers (why you gotta bias wreck me so much). They were out there singing and just having fun as they should. Lot of fan service with each other, kissing and hugging deal including a part where Wendy is in the centre and everyone just extends their affection towards her. They also did acknowledge the banners come the encore talk segment.

Final Talk Segment - This ending talk is where things got **super real**. Right off the bat, Joy started talking about how wonderful it was to finally visit Wendy's hometown and perform as well as how hard Wendy's trained to be a singer reminiscing on their trainee days. *cue members tears*. She mentioned how polar opposite Wendy was to her when they first met, but now she loves her immensely. She also said how crushing it was when all the members would go home for the holidays while Wendy had to stay behind in the dorm because her family was so far away. Irene followed up seeing how much tonight meant to Wendy as much it did for Irene when they did a fan signing last year in Daegu (Daegu is Irene's hometown). She also pointed out that it was almost Wendy's birthday (have fun with that Vancouver), so we all sang happy birthday to Wendy. Seulgi pretty much extended on what Joy said and she was hella emotional. Mentioned how she always invites her friends and family in Korea, but it's a special time for Wendy to do so. Also said she wished she went to school with Wendy so she could meet more friends here and be better in English. Yeri mentioned how it's RV's first time in Canada and she's always wanted to visit and was thankful for a fun time. Also, Yeri said this all in English pretty flawlessly. Way to go girl.

Then we come to Wendy. Wendy chants echo throughout the entire venue. Her emotions were running high on this one although she was pretty composed. She couldn't and still can't believe that they could tour US and Canada. She basically reiterated how special tonight was and how she will never forget it. ""Everyone I love is here."" Her parents were in the crowd. Her friends were in the crowd. One of her teachers was in the crowd. And of course, the hometown love was in the crowd. She hopes to come back soon to perform again (which they need to because her house has yet to be raided).

Red Flavor - After all that sentiment, this song was a rollercoaster for me. Such an energetic way to end off with all the warmness of that last talk segment. Ooh yeah.

After that, they traversed the stage, took a bow on each side before one last one in the centre. And that was that, but not before Toronto could give RV one more Wendy chant.

Overall, I give this concert a **Song of Healing/10**. My heart is healed. I haven't felt so happy to see a concert in so long and I don't think I've ever jammed to every song from beginning to end as much as I did this night. Sorrynotsorry to the people around me for putting up with my crazed fanboying. I'm doing P1 next time. I will be waiting again, my happiness.

K-Pop has gone through numerous survival shows and I'm sure some of you are still holding onto those trainees who should've made the cut in your opinion. If you could help them debut by putting them in a group with other 'rejects', who would make the group?

My group would look something like this:

 Lee Kaeun (Produce 48)

Lee Haein (Produce 101, Idol School)

Ng Sze Kai (Produce 101, MixNine)

Lee Sian (Idol School, Produce 48)

Park Soyeon (Produce 101)

Kim Dani (Produce 101) (where is sheeee)

Natty (Sixteen, Idol School)

Han Chowon (Produce 48)

Kim Eunsuh (Sixteen, Idol School)

I'd like this group a lot because it is well rounded. It has talented dancers, vocalists and rappers. I can see them doing a girl crush type of concept. Maybe something like Weki Meki and ITZY.

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*Arriving at the Venue:\*\* I headed straight to the venue right after work! It was really cold and a small line was starting to form, I didn't think I'd end up talking to anybody but I actually ended up talking with a couple luvies (another luvie was experiencing this as her first concert too!), one of which lent me their portable charger so I could get my free Irene slogan. ;; Speaking of slogans, nothing was free T\_\_T I  was only able to get 2 in the beginning. Good lesson to bring cash next time. I also learned that scalpers have their code message for selling tickets as someone was just yelling ""ANYBODY GOT TICKETS?!"" It was quite bizarre to see lol. The line was starting to become longer and longer to the point where I wasn't even sure if it was a line anymore, Kpopme didn't really specify what line was what as the two lines that were formed were mainly for buying merch or getting pre-order merch. Had to ask a staff member to clarify. Also, kpopme opened the doors late. My toes were beyond any saving at this point but at 7 pm the crowd finally started moving inside!  

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Ticket Processing &amp; The Venue Itself:\*\* I remember being mesmerized by the security and lowkey scared that my Redmare keychain would accidentally set off the metal detector but luckily it didn't and ticket processing went quick (was still mesmerized lol) and in the venue, I went! IT WAS HUGE, LIKE HUGEEEEEEEEEEEE I felt very small lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* The actual seat:\*\* Was super disappointing when I was lead to it. My seat was basically section ""T"" which was *behind* the last row of seats so I'm sitting behind bars lmao. I wasn't really happy with it up since I had paid money to be seated in an actual seat and I was quite sad about it. I ended up missing seeing the girls when they waved from the glass box(?)  I felt pretty isolated from the arena especially since I had gone alone but that went away because as soon the concert started, I realized because I'm behind the arena, I could be as obnoxiously loud as I wanted to be. (I felt bad afterward and ended up apologizing to the people next to me for being too loud lol) The view ended up being really nice! The only issue was that they didn't turn off the lights all the way so it was a little hard in beginning of the concert to immerse myself since the area we were at still had lights on. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

\*\*The actual concert!:\*\*  (I saw the format for another fan account and it might help jog my memory as I forgot most of what happened when I got back home kfjbkf)

\*\*Opening VCR:\*\* It was really funny LOL, like another fan account mentioned, I really liked the Infinity War touch to it lool. 

\*\*Russian Roulette:\*\* THE CROWD WENT WILD! I think I remember hearing fans chant to the chorus and it was sooo lively and fun! It was a little awkward since my section wasn't really yelling all that much, I think I was the only one slightly losing my mind (in a good way, if that's possible lmao) but the girls GAVE IT THEIR DAMN ALL! IF RED VELVET'S CHARISMA AND CHARM PERMEATES THROUGH A SCREEN, OH BOY IS IT MORE CHARISMATIC AND CHARMING IRL! 

\*\*Power Up:\*\* The crowd went insane for this one and the fan chants were even louder! Power Up is one of my personal favourites so I was really hyped up for this one! I wish I had stronger arms though, they got tired really quick. 

\*\*1st Talkment:\*\* It was a little awkward jhdbgrd, the crowd just seemed confused? LOL I remember them asking questions and the crowd's response was just ""wooo?"" I don't remember this part quite well but I think this was just an introduction to the story in their VCR, the girls were super adorable though! 

\*\*My Second Date:\*\* THE DANCE SEGMENTS FOR EACH OF THE GIRLS WERE AMAZING! NO OTHER WORDS THAN THAT! 

\*\*Mosquito:\*\* I *loved* hearing this song live, it was super fun and just overall outgoing! I wish the crowd had gone zzzzzzz with Irene though, that would've have been pretty awesome but otherwise another amazing performance by them. 

\*\*Look:\*\* I really loved the choreo for this song! The girls' moves were all on point and overall a good performance to gently flail my arms too! (because they hurt TT)

\*\*First VCR:\*\* I actually don't quite remember this part aside from the girls respective animal representatives and them being chased by hunters, Joy barely making it. I honestly don't know how to react to the VCRs, it was just hilarity and ""what am I watching"" If that makes sense. 

\*\*Mr. E:\*\* THEY ALL CAME OUT IN ANIMAL COSTUMES, WENDY LOOKED SO ADORABLE IN HERS TT The choreography for this song was really creative and I loved the use of all the props, it was just amazing to see the choreo go so smoothly! 

\*\*Zoo:\*\* This is actually one of my favourite performances of the night! The song was... amazing to hear live along with the instrumentals being so loud, it was just super zany and fun to listen to and watch! 

\*\*Happiness:\*\* The crowd (and I) WENT BONKERS during this performance! I'm actually a baby luvie but I did see RV debut and I'm quite fond of Happiness so hearing this *live* was both exhilarating and emotional! The loudness of fans and RV going ""HAPPINESS"" was truly something else! AND HOW COULD I NOT MENTION WENDY'S ""SHINE ON ME"" Wendy typically got the most screams because it's her homecoming but the screams during this part were pure madness, it was amazing to see her like that along with all the special effects, this was really Wendy's night, SHE ABSOLUTELY KILLED THAT PART! I was screaming my lungs at this point, the crowd was so hyped up and the screams went on until the end of the song. 

\*\*Hit that Drum:\*\* The hype continues! I love this song and the fan chants for ""boom boom, hit that drum!"" was just ahhh, I had nothing but pure adrenaline in me at this point! The crowd went wild once again during Wendy's beautiful high note! She did it so effortlessly, I love her. T\_\_T

\*\*Second VCR:\*\* They're all just at a house (I thought it was a gingerbread house at first...) and then they go outside and Irene gives them some potion to drink which turns Joy and Wendy into giants LOL 

\*\*Lucky Girl &amp; Dracula:\*\* I don't quite remember much of what happened during these performances (hence why I'm putting them together) but I know they came out wearing those outfits with poms-poms on the front lol. 

\*\*All Right:\*\* This where Red Velvet started hurling balls towards people, I looked at this with bittersweet feelings as I was so far that they wouldn't throw it this way. Also, love that they had to go back and forth between hurling balls and then doing the dance. 

\*\*2nd Talkment:\*\* This was more casual and comfortable than the first one! They were talking about Toronto, Wendy introduced herself and we all cheered for her like she was the mayor of Toronto. They couldn't go to Niagara Falls or Wendy's house this time so I'm hoping they do get come around next time (I was pretty sad since I had hoped Wendy would get time to spend time with her family T\_\_T) I don't remember whether this was during the 3rd talkment or 2nd but I think it was either Joy or Irene saying we should all go to Wendy's house together :) 

\*\*Blue Lemonade:\*\* Another great performance, my memory starts to blank around this performance so I don't have much to say rejdbkfe. 

\*\*About Love:\*\* Also can't remember how I felt or what happened during this performance T\_\_T 

\*\*Moonlight Melody:\*\* Things got quieter and it felt like the moment was really sinking in for me, everything else prior to that was just adrenaline filled but during this song it really sank in I'm seeing Red Velvet and they're actually here. All of them looked like they were trying to take in this moment, especially Wendy, I think it was around this performance where you could see her start to be more emotional. :' )

\*\*3rd VCR:\*\* Red Velvet get spooked in a haunted house, I was honestly quite scared as well. 

\*\*Bad Boy:\*\* Before they transitioned into Bad Boy, they actually started with a creepy music box of ICC (and doing robotic moves along with it) which I adored, *loved it.* When they transitioned into Bad Boy, the crowd went wild once again! THE FANCHANTS WERE STRONG FOR THIS ONE, I messed up though, I ended up going ""WHO THAT WHO THAT WHO THAT BOY"" instead of IS but this performance was strong from start to finish and the fan chants held up till the very end too! All in all, GREAT PERFORMANCE!

\*\*Peek-A-Boo:\*\* This is one of my favourite all-time title tracks for Red Velvet, I think I heard fan chants for the chorus here and it was just AMAZING! Seeing them perform some of my favourite songs throughout the concert was honestly so gratifying! 

\*\*Third Talkment:\*\* They asked us if the haunted house from the VCR was scary, I know I said yes for sure lmao. Yeri then asked who in RV was the most scared, we all yelled Yeri and Seulgi said it was actually Irene and that she hadn't even gone in the house LOL and I think they asked Irene if she would go in alone which resulted in ""no"" lool. Yeri then says they have a song specially sung in English and I immediately thought RBB... 

\*\*RBB:\*\* ...Which it was! I have to say a part of me was actually thinking it was a new song written in English for us, just because of how they were phrasing it but nope! The crowd went wild AGAIN! I don't think I heard the fan chants loud enough for ""he's a really bad boy"" but I did for ""OH MY GOD"" also omg, the whistle note irl was *amazing.*  

\*\*Rookie:\*\* The momentum from RBB was still going strong and hearing this song live was sooo good, the crowd was screaming, I was screaming, we were all having a good time! 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*ENCORE\*\*

\*\*Encore VCR:\*\* So turns out Irene was the mastermind all this time! 

\*\*Day 1:\*\* WE FINALLY GOT TO SHOW OUR BANNERS! This was honestly quite emotional to see, the girls were surprised and just in awe, like they were really living in the moment. I think for me, I was just really happy to have participated in something so amazing and sentimental, to go off-topic for a little; I'm also a long-time shawol and having missed so many momentous moments with SHINee made me more grateful to have experienced this with Red Velvet. It's a memory I won't forget, I don't think I can forget the looks on their faces, it was just such a beautiful moment. The girls were more relaxed, giving us lots of fanservice (yeah Yeri! I'm looking at you! She tried play kissing Wendy lool) and it was just overall sweet and fun. 

\*\*Final Talkment:\*\* This talkment was the longest and the most emotional by far. I don't remember all the details but I know Joy was the most emotional and said a lot of sweet things towards Wendy, she told Wendy she worked hard and did well, she talked about she didn't think she and Wendy could be friends because of how polar opposite they were when they first met as trainees. Joy was pretty much crying at this point, she told Wendy she loved her and I think Wendy said it back in a smaller voice too, Wendy was also starting to cry at this point, everyone was starting to crying at this point. Joy and Seulgi both touched on how much it actually hurt leaving Wendy behind when they all got to visit their families, Seulgi was crying at this point too, I'm really glad the crowd let them speak and wasn't cheering over their messages because this was honestly quite a milestone for Red Velvet and Wendy herself. T\_\_T  Seulgi also said how she had wished she could have studied English and met Wendy earlier. Irene talked about it felt for her when they had a fan sign in her hometown Daegu and she understands just how much this night means for Wendy, she wasn't crying but you could tell she was emotional. She also mentioned that Canada is cold and she couldn't believe Wendy attended school in such weather and that she would lend them her coat, she said she's warm-hearted Wendy. T\_\_\_T The person next to me is crying silently, I'm crying silently and a lot, it was just so... emotional. The girls really let their thoughts loose and I'm so happy they did. Yeri, keeping it short and sweet, I don't quite remember what she said because I was just crying a lot lol. But I do remember her mentioning how she always wanted to visit Canada when she was younger. I forgot who it was that asked but because Wendy's birthday was coming up soon, they asked if we could sing Happy Birthday to her and so we did, it was beautiful. ;;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Wendy:\*\* They actually excluded Wendy from Rock, Paper, Scissors when deciding who should talk first LOL so Wendy was last and we all cheered so loud for her, ""WENDY, WENDY, WENDY"" pretty much filled up the arena and shouts and screeches of ""I LOVE YOU WENDY"" rang through the arena. Wendy was already crying and she was just overwhelmed that she was even here tonight, she told her mom to stop crying (Irene also pointed out that her mom was crying as well earlier) because she can see her. She said she couldn't believe their US tour and then she couldn't *believe* that they were coming to Canada to perform. Her family, her friends, her *teacher* were all there to support her, in Wendy's words, ""all the people I love are here tonight."" She said she was just a little girl studying in Canada and now she's coming back home to perform for reveluvs, she felt like she was dreaming. She was crying a lot and shouts of ""I LOVE YOU"" rang through the arena again and this time Wendy said it back to us. She thanked us and said that hopefully this is the first step to coming here more often and I share the same sentiment. I think she made us pinky-promise to come back when they come here next time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Red Flavour ended up being the last song, the crowd hyped once again, we all sang together, Seulgi and Yeri were being super playful, it was a wonderful way to end the night. After the song, they took pictures with us, one with the dancers and the other without. They got up, went to each side of the stage and said: ""Thank you!"" And then we had to say bye, which we did for 2 minutes until they got off stage. I went home and couldn't shake off the emotional ending of it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm super happy my first concert was something memorable and special both to luvies and Red Velvet. It was emotional, fun and monumental. I hope this fan account was easy to read if you even made it this far lol, it's my first so I hope it went smoothly, I'm probably forgetting details or messing up some details so I hope nothing was confusing. Other than that... Yeah, that was my first concert! ",3,65,False,self,,,,,

This is not to encourage rudeness or inflammatory remarks, just unpopular opinions that others would probably disagree with. Here's mine:

1. Kpop slang (i.e. shook, wig snatch, stan talent, etc.) is super cringy. It actually wouldn't be that bad if not for the fact that it's said about everyone, so it just feels like it's digressed into filler words when there's nothing else to say.
2. BTS peaked at the ""Young Forever"" album repackage and will probably never reach that level of artistry again if they continue down the American mainstream path.
3. EXO's ""EX'ACT"" and much of ""The Power of Music"" were complete misses for me. Some tracks (Monster, Lotto, Going Crazy) are really good, but the rest I haven't listened to since release. I expected better from EXO.
4. I love Roa from Pristin but the group had absolutely no good songs. The subunit Pristin V was great and should have been what Pledis went with originally, but unfortunately we got stuck with half-baked ideas and weird sparkly cutesy stuff. One of my least favorite discographies of all time.
5. The average random soloist is far more talented than your fav. There's so many talented soloists (Minseo for example, COUGH) who have way more stage presence, natural vocal talent, and musical creativity than the average group member. Often times they're better than group members from what we consider really talented groups.
6. (This one's not that unpopular but while I'm here.) The fetishizing of cutesy stuff and aegyo is a) gross and b) really gross. This is mostly towards the female groups who do it, and you can tell how cringey everyone (even them) think it is.
7. The ""\[insert female idol\] hates men"" meme is cringy.
8. I love Red Velvet but RBB was one of the worst title tracks I have ever heard from them. 

That's enough for me, although I'm sure I have tons. Share yours, I want to know what others secretly think.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I sometimes stumble upon videos that rank members of a certain group from least to most popular based on poll results. And in some groups the members are somewhat equally popular (Blackpink seems to be the case) and in some groups there is a huge disparity between the members' popularities (for instance to my surprise in BTS where I would have thought all the members to have similar popularities, V and Jungkook have almost 50% of the votes).

What do you think played a part in your bias group's popularity destribution? Group size, overall group popularity, the members' individual promotions, the member's characters, the members' nationalities?

Even their songs sound the same to me and have lost their charm.

I would like to preface this by saying that this will likely be controversial and I completely understand why. But I would like some honest feedback and some discussion on these videos that I have observed about Lia. 

Recently I was watching Itzy's new dance video, and saw what appeared to be a bulge near Lia's crotch, from this video: https://youtu.be/ay97L0DAu9A?t=153. (2:33), although I am unsure if it is just the outfit. 

Furthermore, in Lia's M/V Behind the scenes, there's a scene where she's holding up her hands and her ring finger is significantly longer than her index finger, which is a sign of high testosterone levels. https://youtu.be/1b_-JQLgjM8?t=94 (1:34) according to this research: https://www.livescience.com/49883-finger-length-in-men.html

According to Wikipedia, ""All of the members, with the exception of Lia, appeared in Mnet's reality show Stray Kids as a project group against the boy group Stray Kids in 2017.[5]"". Lia is the only ITZY member who appeared out of nowhere, and mysteriously the only thing we know is that they used to be an SM trainee. She conveniently popped up after Somi's abrupt departure from JYP, suggesting Lia was a last minute fill-in and was not meant to be in the group. 

If Lia was indeed what I believe she is, it would make sense why she has such a low vocal range and struggled to sing the high notes in their first win Encore stage to the point where Yeji had to back her vocals up. 

Regardless, I find all the girls in ITZY beautiful, talented, and respect JYP's decision-making. But I couldn't help but wonder if there was more to it than what we see.

I acknowledge I could definitely be wrong, but I would like to ask if anyone else noticed these? ",4,0,False,self,,,,,

**Why I quit being a Kpop fan** 

I discovered Kpop is 2010, when I was seven years old. From the age of eight to sixteen, Kpop was my life. I loved listening to the music, watching the music videos, and learning more about Korean culture. I never reached a point where I wanted to learn Korean or move to Korea like I saw so many of my fellow Kpop fans do, but the effect Kpop had on my life was astounding. I never realized that I felt such deep feelings towards Kpop until January 2019. I read news that one of my favorite idols, whom I shipped with a group member, was dating the idol that I hated the most. I had an anxiety attack and had heart palpitations for over two weeks. This incident is laughable now, and you might even think my life is pathetic for this. But then, at the moment, I felt so many emotions and was so strongly affected by something that had no real effect on my actual life that it was clear to me that I was time to end this obsession. Prior to this incident, there were some other events that hinted to me that my love for Kpop was getting out of hand. I felt like I was superior to fans who had started listening to Kpop in like 2016 because of BTS and even started to disassociate myself with Kpop fans who were crazy when I was just like them. My best friend, who was Korean (a coincidence, I swear), would tell me how uncomfortable she felt when people would start speaking to her in Korean, calling her unnie, and asking her about Kpop. While I had never done any of those things and had always hidden my obsession with Kpop (even when I had first started listening to Shinee, SNSD, and Bigbang around 2010-11), I felt embarrassed that I and so many others had such strong reactions to Kpop. At that point (around 2016), I had started to distance myself from major Kpop groups and friends who were fans. I started listening to underrated artists and appreciate music for what it was, an art. Even then, I felt superior to those who were fans of popular and overrated artists, such as TWICE, BLACKPINK, and BTS. As I have grown as a person and matured, I have learned that Kpop isnt for me. The fandom culture, the drama, and obsession simply does not have a place in my life anymore. 

I have reached points where I have become so obsessed and hateful towards idols and fans that it has scared me. I never went to the internet to write hateful things about anyone, but it was so internalized that everytime I would see a certain idol and their group, I would feel so annoyed and it would affect me for hours. I truly believed that a certain ship was real and thought of them as a real couple; I followed accounts that supported them, read fanfictions about them, and watched fancams from concerts and reality tv shows showing them being romantic towards one another. When I first read the news, I was truly heartbroken. I felt like someone had broken up with me and cried for hours on end. I knew it was wrong for me to feel this way, because these idols had their own lives and should not have to think about what they do. During this incident, I read proof from other shippers and fans that the relationship was not real and that this person had sacrificed themself for the sake of their real relationship. I know, saying that now makes me realize how crazy I was being lol. I had even reached a point when I felt hopeless because my favorite company was not doing as well as they were before. I felt like I wasnt a good fan and felt so much hatred towards other groups/companies that did not have to work hard but got everything handed to them. Yes, there are people in the Kpop industry who are not appreciated enough despite their talent, hard work, and charisma. That being said, those who are successful are not to be blamed for this. The Kpop Industry has flaws, some that are obvious (colorism, body positivity) and some that are not so obvious (the impact of brand name  companies, looks &gt; talent). Im not here to criticize the industry and its fans though; Im simply saying that I have grown up with Kpop and decided to leave that part of me behind. 

I stopped listening to Kpop for two weeks after this incident and deactivated my Instagram that was dedicated to Kpop. I started discovering music that I truly loved listening to and art that I appreciated. Kpop has this amazing power to bring people together and heal people, but it can also hurt and divide people. I have grown and left this part of my life behind, but that doesnt mean that everyone has to. I just hope that my opinion and history might help someone who is in the same place I was and is considering leaving the Kpop fandom. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

----

Hello r/kpop!. I am a student in cultural anthropology at Kansas State University. I am conducting research for a short ethnography, using this subreddit as one of my field sites. Ethnography is the scientific description of the customs of individual peoples and cultures. My focus is on cultures surrounding Hallyu and my research will last through May. This research project has been approved by the University Research Compliance Office. 

----

**Interviews**

I am conducting interviews in person or through video calls, audio will be recorded for transcription purposes. Personal information will be confidential, interviews will be anonymous, and informants will have pseudonyms. If you are willing to be interviewed, please comment in this thread or DM me. I may also directly contact individuals of interest and ask for interviews.

**Participant Observation**

This is a type of data collection method typically used in qualitative research and ethnography. In this context, I will be commenting and interacting with other users in the sub. I'll record observations as fieldnotes, but it will all be anonymous. No names or usernames will be published. I've changed my flair to ""ethnographer"" to identify myself to everyone.

**Topics of Interest**

Broadly, this is about culture. As my research goes on, I will narrow in on some topics. I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a few years now and have been a kpop fan for several years, so I have some themes in mind, but everything is flexible and depends on my informants and the data available. Some topics of interest for me right now are cultural appropriation v appreciation, globalization, and conflicting cultural differences.

----

If you have any questions whatsoever, feel free to ask. **If you would like to decline any involvement in this research, please reach out to me.**",17,13,False,self,,,,,

Im reposting because i didnt have all my facts straight and it totally derailed what the post was supposed to be about. Gonna fix that and just alert everyone that queens are arriving

So!!! im pretty excited for a girl group debut thats coming in March. Theyve been pushing the date back for a while but they have been promoting for over a year now. Since no one else is posting about them, I will **gladly** take that responsibility upon myself.

Their group name is HIGHSCHOOL. They definitely seem to be a """"""girl crush""""""(aka non cutesy) concept. There are four members. Their CEO has had them wear masks their entire promotional time because **he wants people to focus on their talent pre-debut and not just their looks. The masks will come off when they debut.** He also has stated that although he knows beauty standards in Korea will be difficult to change, that hes willing to try. They have been promoting in Thailand a lot and are now the third most anticipated debut there right now. 

On their official IG page theres some of their promotional stuff like dance covers and  audio teasers. They also do alot of Vlives and had a reality show at one point, too.

Enough rambling, have some receipts.

They remind me of 2ne1 and my aching heart is yearning for a group to fill the void after such a wild disbandment situation, lol. Just thought i would spread hype for them! Looks like they might depend on I-fans support anyway because of their concept and approach to their debut. I dont think i need to talk about how unique concepts tend to go in kpop. 


P.S. THEIR FAN CLUB NAME MAKES ACTUAL SENSE!!! They asked for suggestions and went with ""high class"".

The artists' stylists really take risks with outfits and stage looks. It's probably something that really helped me get into kpop.

So the discussion I have is, what your favorite stage outfits for 
1. your bias?
2. the whole group?

Personally I love anything Lisa from BLACKPINK wears in he stage performances but when it comes to group stage I've really been living everything Itzy has worn.
It's one thing to have an amazing outfit on one person but it's another to see every outfit on the stage come together.",3,6,False,self,,,,,

Seventeen

The Boyz

Astro

NCT (I guess it would have to be addressed to a specific unit...)

Pentagon

Stray Kids

WJSN

Mamamoo

EXID

Red Velvet

Pristin

I stan many more groups but these are some of the ones I'm most interested in sending mail to. I'm just interested in sending letters btw. I just don't know how I would get the letters to them because I don't want to send them to the wrong place. I'm just wondering.

They never charted and I didn't expect Rooftop to chart. A week ago they charted for the first time at 97. I didn't think much of it because I thought it'd fall out of the charts. 

And then the rising started. It just kept going. it peaked at #3 just now on Melon which is huge since I don't think an idol rock song has debuted that high. I hope it continues rising to #1 even! 

Apparently someone posted the music video as an ad on Youtube, which got it trending and because people loved the song, it rose that way.

**Why I quit being a Kpop fan**

I discovered Kpop is 2010, when I was seven years old. From the age of eight to sixteen, Kpop was my life. I loved listening to the music, watching the music videos, and learning more about Korean culture. I never reached a point where I wanted to learn Korean or move to Korea like I saw so many of my fellow Kpop fans do, but the effect Kpop had on my life was astounding. I never realized that I felt such deep feelings towards Kpop until January 2019. I read news that one of my favorite idols, whom I shipped with a group member, was dating the idol that I hated the most. I had an anxiety attack and had heart palpitations for over two weeks. This incident is laughable now, and you might even think my life is pathetic for this. But then, at the moment, I felt so many emotions and was so strongly affected by something that had no real effect on my actual life that it was clear to me that I was time to end this obsession. Prior to this incident, there were some other events that hinted to me that my love for Kpop was getting out of hand. I felt like I was superior to fans who had started listening to Kpop in like 2016 because of BTS and even started to disassociate myself with Kpop fans who were crazy when I was just like them. My best friend, who was Korean (a coincidence, I swear), would tell me how uncomfortable she felt when people would start speaking to her in Korean, calling her unnie, and asking her about Kpop. While I had never done any of those things and had always hidden my obsession with Kpop (even when I had first started listening to Shinee, SNSD, and Bigbang around 2010-11), I felt embarrassed that I and so many others had such strong reactions to Kpop. At that point (around 2016), I had started to distance myself from major Kpop groups and friends who were fans. I started listening to underrated artists and appreciate music for what it was, an art. Even then, I felt superior to those who were fans of popular and overrated artists, such as TWICE, BLACKPINK, and BTS. As I have grown as a person and matured, I have learned that Kpop isnt for me. The fandom culture, the drama, and obsession simply does not have a place in my life anymore.

I have reached points where I have become so obsessed and hateful towards idols and fans that it has scared me. I never went to the internet to write hateful things about anyone, but it was so internalized that everytime I would see a certain idol and their group, I would feel so annoyed and it would affect me for hours. I truly believed that a certain ship was real and thought of them as a real couple; I followed accounts that supported them, read fanfictions about them, and watched fancams from concerts and reality tv shows showing them being romantic towards one another. When I first read the news, I was truly heartbroken. I felt like someone had broken up with me and cried for hours on end. I knew it was wrong for me to feel this way, because these idols had their own lives and should not have to think about what they do. During this incident, I read proof from other shippers and fans that the relationship was not real and that this person had sacrificed themself for the sake of their real relationship. I know, saying that now makes me realize how crazy I was being lol. I had even reached a point when I felt hopeless because my favorite company was not doing as well as they were before. I felt like I wasnt a good fan and felt so much hatred towards other groups/companies that did not have to work hard but got everything handed to them. Yes, there are people in the Kpop industry who are not appreciated enough despite their talent, hard work, and charisma. That being said, those who are successful are not to be blamed for this. The Kpop Industry has flaws, some that are obvious (colorism, body positivity) and some that are not so obvious (the impact of brand name  companies, looks &gt; talent). Im not here to criticize the industry and its fans though; Im simply saying that I have grown up with Kpop and decided to leave that part of me behind.

I stopped listening to Kpop for two weeks after this incident and deactivated my Instagram that was dedicated to Kpop. I started discovering music that I truly loved listening to and art that I appreciated. Kpop has this amazing power to bring people together and heal people, but it can also hurt and divide people. I have grown and left this part of my life behind, but that doesnt mean that everyone has to. I just hope that my opinion and history might help someone who is in the same place I was and is considering leaving the Kpop fandom.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

Firstly I am quite fluent in English at this point, but I'd like to apologize for any structural or grammatical mistakes I will likely make. It is my third, thank you for understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background. I was born in Eastern Europe and had lived there for about 10 years, then moved to North America. Another 10 years passed here I am. I started with Twice, move to Blackpink, discovered Red Velvet. Nowadays it's mostly IU, Mamamoo, Sunmi, Chungha, GOT7, Park Hyo Shin, EXID and so on. Still listen to the original three.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am by far not an expert. But what is the point of a visual? This all started when I read somewhere that agencies often rank looks above true talent. To me that is absolutely insane. I understand life is not fair. But if I went onto a survival show and lost to a girl who clearly is less talented than me due to shear physical appearance I would create new shades of red with all the blood I'd spill. From what I gather South Korea is quite vain. Like many countries. And there may not be nothing wrong with it. But to put it on a pedestal where the essence of your entertainment is so cheapened. I do say cheapened not because admiring physical beauty is a sin, but because often times that physical beauty is due to plastic. In that case that makes even less sense. Why would someone deserve to be an idol for being so attractive if it isn't even their beauty to begin with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I realize I could be talking out of my ass. But please bear with me. If someone is willing to teach, I am willing to learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

About their Groups:
Fei: I was very happy to be (able to promote) in miss A. No matter what group it is, the time to leave will eventually come. The best times will soon become our youth, important times and happy times are left. Its an unforgettable memory.

Hyomin: I got goosebumps. Thats how I said it too. 
Youth, unforgettable times, and important memories.
Fei: Its a precious memory that youll think of a few moments before death. (Kinda like how your life flashes before your eyes?)

Fei: Even if my life is not perfect, its thanks to that memory that my life is 30% happy. Even though it was tiring, I want to promote as miss A again.
Hyomin (not sure about this part): There are hateful(?) periods but even that cant be thrown away. Nothing will be able to change that.



Predebut Life:

Fei: When I was a trainee I couldnt even say hello in Korean. It was more mentally exhausting than physically. How much more do I have to do so I can debut? I thought about that a lot. It was so difficult that I just gave up and went home to look for something else to do. But my mum said that since Ive already put in effort, I shouldnt give up just like that. (That give me more determination.)

Hyomin agreed: It was hard when I want to do better but couldnt manage to. But I cant show that greed to people who are looking after me (another sentence im unsure of)

Fei to Hyomin: What would you choose between singing and acting?
Hyomin: Thats difficult.
Fei: When I havent tried acting, my choice would be singing for sure. You have to showcase everything as a singer, for acting its something you have to catch. Which is a total opposite. Thats why even though it was a bit uncomfortable at first, it was really fun when I tried out acting. I cant choose now either.

Hyomin: When I was younger, whenever I face a hardship/obstacle, Ill always wonder why does this happen to me? while blaming others and even myself, and thoughts of regret. Then again, even if my occupation wasnt a celebrity, this is something that people/I will come to face. Itd be great if there are no bad things, but I have good thoughts about the times that have past. Its the reason why Ive learnt so much.

Both: I have to look for my own happiness. For the future.

Just a heads up, this ain't gonna be the best fan account purely because I have a terrible memory, my phone overheated partway through the night and I'm an awful writer so please bear with me. If any Australian stays wanna help me out with some details, please do!

Rightios, off we go - to my third kpop concert rodeo.

**PRE-CONCERT**

The concert was held on a Thursday night - weird, just a little - and I'm from interstate, so in addition to my [cat1 general admission](https://imgur.com/fh0WAgx) ticket, I had already spent a fair amount of money. I left the night before with a friend, arriving in town around 6am, then had some downtime in my airbnb before heading off into the CBD for some brekky, keeping in mind the [official schedule](https://imgur.com/urnP88i). I had another group of friends, some which were VIP ticket holders, who came the day before, and they were the ones to inform me at 10.30am, that there was already a massive line-up at the venue. Well fuck, if we wanted barrier spots, you best bet we had to get there ASAP. We did, and as it turns out, they were giving out wristbands with marked numbers, and at that point the VIP line had reached 150+ people. On the opposite side of the venue, the cat1 line had only hit around 25 people. The best part about this? Despite being off-schedule, the line was semi-official - Australian Stays had worked hard to get into contact with the venue and security in order to organise lines independently, in which they were given the ok. I had been given number 27, had my name taken down and was told to go freely. 

By the grace of god, I had mustered the patience (although born mostly out of laziness and fatigue of overnight travel) to sit in line for the rest of the day. Close-by, a line for merch had begun so we moved a little over to sit by about, the 10th person. Lucky for us, as 2pm approached and the merch shop had opened, the line easily stretched 150m+ and about 3 people wide. [Merchandise](https://imgur.com/a/7RuugcZ) was fairly go-to, I walked off with a tour t-shirt that although hadn't looked nearly as snazzy as the hoodie, was far more agreeable for my burnt wallet. Posters were supposed to be $20AUD but on the day, were listed as $40AUD. What the actual heck? 

Whatever, another few hours, and we'd be in the concert venue - I tapped into my deepest state of zen to last me until those glorious doors opened. The time comes after a deadass 7 hours in line, we get checked in and we get our[ barrier spots.](https://imgur.com/czDa0Vg) We watch as the VIP section gets filled to capacity - it had easily looked like more than 300 people in what was a fairly small venue. The rush to the barriers had been goddamn frightening to watch. In terms of fan demographics, a few groups of guys were definitely around, most of them in in balcony seating but definitely a fair amount in the pit. Also spotted, mums and the grandparents hanging with their kids in VIP! I hope they enjoyed their hi-touch, oof. Welp here we go, 7pm start.

**THE CONCERT**

Look, this is where things get a little fuzzy. I'm not a Stray Kids stan but I do love all their title releases but from what I could tell, the Unveil Tour setlist was in chronological order, from Mixtape to their latest I Am You EP. The energy was amazing, each member had completely killed their parts, and my attention swerved manically as each member worked hard for your attention. Honestly, Changbin and Jisung are honestly some of the greatest performers because each and every syllable is so well enunciated, their flow so smooth and power so well-controlled, no shortcuts here. Chan too, although wasn't a main dancer, had completely taken that spot for the night, putting it all in for every move.

Seungmin had injured himself the few days before the concert, and Australian Stays were worried he wasn't going to be able to show his face. But alas, he was there, seated comfortably on the side and not once forgotten, as fans cheered loudly every time his part came up. Now, this is where my part (sorta, questionably) comes in, as they were rounding the members in for a selfie with the crowd, the members had taken to moving Seungmin to the centre themselves. Like a king in a palanquin, I yelled as anyone else would have done, ""Kings!"", which the members would then chuckle and Changbin agreeing, [""Yea, he is king""](https://twitter.com/seonghwahwahwa/status/1098523507498123264). 

They all really know how to work up a crowd as well! My Pace began with Changbin getting everyone to chant his ""na na na"" part at the beginning before the music kicked in, and similarly with Awkward Silence, Chan getting everyone to do the crow's caw, lmao. 

Oh the ments! Good ol' Australian spirit - whereas the concert was supposed to last only two hours, it lasted an extra half-hour because the other members wanted a taste of that Australian patriotism. Chan led the chant, ""Aussie, Aussie, Aussie"" and we chanted back ""oi, oi, oi"" like we would any day. Well, Felix did it, then Changbin did it, then Jisung did it and really goddamn enjoyed it. As well as that, I think Aussie line was just glad to be on home ground, albeit not in Sydney. Felix spoke about how hard it was, and despite some fans cheering, he remained really serious about it; the trainee life was hard, super hard and shouldn't be taken lightly. He hadn't been back in Australia since he left to train, so he looked sorta happy to be comfortably communicating and along with that, thanked Chan for being his greatest pillar of support since he stepped foot in SK. It was safe to say, that everyone's hearts ached for him, but with their success as rookies, we were all sure that Stray Kids would have plenty of other opportunities to hang around the land down under. Each member also commented on that; happy that Felix and Chan looked happy to be in their 'hometown', Australia, lmao. I.N. beautifully put it; [that it was his dream to be a part of their dreams to perform in their home country](https://twitter.com/ultstrayk/status/1098590860185194496). Melbourne was no Sydney to them, but nevertheless, I think some of the sentiments still rung true. Chan and Felix both also took the time to talk about their support for Stays as well, and for their ages, spoke maturely and encouragingly, motivating everyone all to work hard, and never give up and if anything, hit them up with their concerns. Chan ensured us that he reads them, on all platforms! Bless that boy for trying.

Jisung's English, goddamn boy - he was throwing colloquialisms left, right and forth - honestly sounded like a current native to me, even though he had grown up in Malaysia(?). It was cute when he had forgotten some words in English, threw the word in Korean, and tried to come back to English. 

Aegyo ments are a little hard to watch for me now, but there are always some good laughs to come out of it, and anyone that can take a jab is worth applauding. Even better, [Australian themed aegyo](https://twitter.com/senracha/status/1098762627319193600) - whatta combo. 

After the first hour or so, at the end of the first half, these kids really tried to pretend as if the concert was over and did their 'final' greeting - unfortunately, I spoiled it for myself and had a glance at their setlist in Bangkok so whilst everyone was screaming for an encore, I was telling my friends to chill and just wait for the VCR kek. 

Look, I wasn't a stan before and a cat1 ticket was kind of a rash decision, but 100% worth it. Stray Kids are still definitely so young but the talent really is overflowing, and their musicality is already in great condition so early in their careers. I hope to see some new concepts in time, a step away from their edm-focused music maybe? Whatever it may be, definitely a loyal supporter until then. 

Well, I think that brings us to the end sorta - there were heaps of good ments in the concert, but my writing skills are wearing thin to be honest. I'm still riding the concert high so many days after, and wish future concert goers a good time!

Ah also, as Melbourne is known for, Australian Stays made a little art mural down the city's famous graffiti lane, this is [her!](https://twitter.com/StrayKids_Aus/status/1097260267598053376) I think these are often only temporary but cool nonetheless.

Those who may have any knowledge of me on here would know that Jisung was my one-pick all the way through Produce 101 and my bias in Wanna One. I was so happy to know that he was having a fan meeting  and extra happy to pick up a ticket.

The venue was the Blue Card Hall in Itaewon which happens to be the same location that he will have his musical debut in 'Those Days' (albeit in a different hall), so it was nice to see pictures of him everywhere both for the fanmeet and the musical. Honestly, seeing his pictures everywhere was just nice to see. He wassn't the most popular member in Korea (that would probably go to Daniel or Sungwoon) but to see all the Babals there for him and only him... made me so proud of all that he was able to acheive.

I got to the venue with enough time to spare but most of his merch was already sold out. The only things that were left were his light sticks, t-shirts and a tumbler (I just got the light stick). After getting the stick, I went to my standing section line (I was in standing B). It was a long wait to get into the venue but we finally got in, but not before there was a bit of a disaster where a fanboy dropped his lightstick down the stairs. Everyone went ballistic at the disaster and I picked it up for him, and gave him a pity smile. Luckily, he fixed it and everyone cheered. It maked for a pre-cursory mood boost.

The venue was arty and beautiful, just like Jisung and the stage decor was very warm. I was in a very good place to appreciate the whole scene but as soon as Jisung came out, there was a massive crowd surge and everyone started shoving forward. This is how it must have been during the Wanna One days, if not worse. Everywhere Jisung went, the crowd would try to follow him. It was worse in the A section than the B one as people were desperately screaming for people to stop. The blessing of being a tall(er than the average Korean girl) black woman is that some people would try to shove me too but when they saw that I wasn't moving, they would stop.

When Jisung first came out, he was really nervous, and seeing all the pushing really didn't help. His smile seemed forced and he was very restrained. The MC of the show did a very good job of relaxing him and he slowly became more like himself. Jaehwan came out on the day I was there (Daewhi was on the Sunday) but I didn't hear the calls for Jaehwan to go away. I think that was all in the A section. A was really terrible to be in I guess.

He did performances of his mini album as well as games on stage. He his a frantic 'This or That' challenge and there was a part where Babals wrote challenges outside of the venue and he had to perform them with various props. He had a sexy striptease, dances with other groups and a baby shark performance. At this point, he was his usual chirpy self and was having a lot of fun. He had a phone in section too where (before the fanmeeting) people would send in voice recordings. It was lovely as there were foreign Babals sending in messages too and you could tell that he was really touched by all of it. Perhaps it took going solo to realise how loved he really was/is. I genuinely felt alone as a fan of Jisung so it was nice to see in person the love he is getting!

He did something wonderful by providing everyone who went to the fanmeeting a [0th Babal Membership](https://twitter.com/Nessiesenpai/status/1099290907268997122) as a waiting for when he comes out of the Army (as he will have to go in this year) It was so thoughtful! 

Overall, it was a wonderful day. I am so happy for him. I hope that today was just as great and he takes away great memories of it! Thank you so much, Yoon Jisung!",14,65,False,self,,,,,

Now, when it was announced SKZ was coming here, I was hesitant, because I was more of a casual fan of them, but decided to use my birthday money to get a ticket, so it became a late birthday present!


I was seated all the way back in Cat 2, so it was far from the stage, but I could see them all clearly, their dance moves and their costumes, but had to look to the screens as I couldnt see their faces well.


The setlist was the same as it was for the SEA (Bangkok etc.) performances, and they divided their songs based on albums, I am NOT, I am:WHO and I am:YOU.


Before the concert, there was a massive line for merch and VIP lineup, and some people even camped out for a night. After I got to my seat in Cat 2, there was alot of waiting for it to start, and I got to talk to a nice lady (She was 35!) and it was cool seeing her be a SKZ fan at her age. 


So the show starts with an Intro VCR, and everyone screamed when the lights lit up on SKZ and they immediately performed Hellevator. They then performed another song, and went into group and individual introductions. Unfortunately there was a cameraman mistake and we missed Lee Knows intro lol. Chan and Felix were all super happy to be back in Sydney and the loudest cheers of the night were always for those two. Seungmin was also in a chair sitting down for the whole performance w no choreo because he hurt his back.


Then we move onto District 9 and other B-sides. Their choreo is super clean by the way, I was so entranced by their dance skills. My eyes were consistently drawn to Han and Hyunjin, their stage presence was amazing.


After that, they did a funny moment segment, where they would do some cute aegyo pose and stuff. One that stuck with me the most was when Felix did his, and said BANANA BOAT! in a cute voice. Aus people will get that old ad that played on tv, and the whole audience loved it. Everyone was amazing at being funny, especially Hyunjin with his sexy rolls and Han with his absolute commitment to ageyo.


Changbin asked us to guess what song was next, and then he just said NanaNANAnaaa and everyone lost their shit. He asked us to repeat the Nanana two more times, and used that as a smooth segue straight into My Pace. My Pace was easily the favourite of the night, everyone knew the fanchant and were all singing along. Afterwards they performed Awkward Silence, and everybody loved that song and we all yelled out hardest at THERE YOU GO MATE! Then there were a few other songs and we had another break with VCR.


After that, they performed I Am You, Voices and other songs. 


Then there was another break, and after every break they were always drenched with sweat, so concerts must be hard. This time, they gave their thanks for STAY for coming to their concert and gave their own personal speeches. Felix and Bang Chan were given the most attention as it was the most important to them. Felix went first, and he had a long (but cute!) ramble on how he had trouble adjusting to Korea and how much he missed his family and Sydney. You could see his eyes watering up but he actually said NO I said I wouldnt cry!! so he held it in. Until it was Bang Chans turn to speak hahaha. 


Bang Chan also gave a moving speech on how he missed his family and how he left Sydney for JYP in 2011, and he just broke down when he said I missed Australia. He really did, and he was so grateful that he could come back here to perform. He said My family is here! and I actually saw they were two rows in front of my spot, and I could see them well. I think his mother sobbed a bit aww. He then also went on to say what a good friend Felix was and how Chan helped Felix adjust to the culture and how Felix wouldnt get along with trainees. Felix then just broke down too and for both the members it was emotional. It was at this point, Felix and Chan just hugged it out and it was quite a tender moment. Then Chan was like Its supposed to be HAPPY! Argh! they had a group hug then got their happy faces back on and they performed the last round of songs, School Life, Yayaya and Grow Up. 


Yayaya was amazing, the crowd was just bouncing around and the boys were just feeling the energy, it was also one of the best songs of the night. I also saw someone in the VIP section at the barricade faint at this time and security had to lift her out and take her outside, I hope shes alright now. 


Then the last song came, and everyone raised their hands for Grow Up, and it was a great time. It was quite an emotional song too so that was even worse. A fitting end.


At the end, they were like, were DEFINITELY coming back to Sydney! And they meant it, I think there are already plans for SKZ in the future to come back to Aus again, and I would definitely hope they do come back!


In the end, they all waved goodbye and left with smiles on their faces! It was a great experience to watch SKZ in Sydney. All the Aussie STAYS were very respectful and there was no shoving in the pit that I could see. However, flashlights and banners were banned so that was a bit disappointing.


In all, it was just a wonderful show and I was pleasantly entertained as a causal fan. I will check out some more of their B-sides, since several caught my attention throughout the show and I made a mental note to remember them! Was definitely well worth the money spent, SKZ were a treat!

Im here as a BESTFRIEND, someone who loves and supports BOYFRIEND dearly, and I'm both pissed and confused. If you don't know Boyfriend, it's ok, they've been dead for like 3 years ago, releasing some OK-ish content in Japan and that's it (their last PV is worth your while, tho: [Stay The Way You Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaP4YXDjU44&amp;feature=youtu.be))

The thing is, there are THREE whole songs under their Spotify ""page"" that are definitely NOT their songs.  [1](https://open.spotify.com/track/4HEqXWMwtw7aaKyZ5omcX9?si=rEU55jWdQOePz_cyRjN1pQ) [2](https://open.spotify.com/track/02Fj9RdfqqmgiFPEnU01nU?si=HLjQZ3SHT8irlmW87pkcJg) &amp; [3](https://open.spotify.com/track/1qZUbtGrLu5Qgs6Tk1CSg0?si=XZqEMCLHQs2NTOCL47Phug). Me and some friends tried reaching out to notify Spotify over this issue, but apparently the only way to get it removed was to become their manager and tbh, that's way too risky. I do not want to have problems with Starship for 3 songs that dont beat the 3 min mark.  So i'm posting this to know if any of you know how to deal with this, if there's a better way to reach spotify, or if we should just... ignore these songs existence just like their company do to the boys.

That's all for now! Did you also love fromis_9's Love Bomb as much as r/kpop did (so much that it was voted for #2 in the Top Ten Tuesdays Tracks of 2018)? Do you drive a chevrolet movie theater? Do you think SEVENTEEN's vocal line is 20 out of 20? And most importantly, is your wig still in OrbiT? Find out and listen to this week's songs! Thanks for participating, have fun reviewing, and hope you have a great week!

I just brought a Loona Max and Match limited album from someone on Instagram named aoiaoiseul who is based from Russia. Although I have looked over the pictures she has sent me and determined this album looked real, I want to get a second opinion on whether you guys think this album is authentic. The album has a Komca sticker and everything but the sticker sticked onto some of the words in the back that talks about the manufacturing details. Other people\`s Komca stickers do not stick on the words in the back at all. I might be just a bit paranoid but I want to make sure that this album is legit. Unfortunately the pictures she sent was quite blurry so it might be a bit hard to see.

Before I start, let me just preface this by saying that my brain is still running on Red Velvet hype, and therefore my words might be a bit jumbled and not one hundred percent accurate, haha. If there's anything about the show that I have reported wrong here, people that attended the show, please correct me. 

__**Context**__

Ive read quite a few fan accounts for Redmare in North America stops, but Ive never really seen a (general, not specifically Red Velvet) account of what its like to attend a K-pop concert with a physical disability. 

Just a bit more context before I delve into concert preparations and the concert itself, I wanted to briefly explain my physical disability. I think, that for a lot of disabled individuals that going to a big social event like a concert is certainly stressful; especially in a concert where everyone is expected to stand up and dance. So, I wanted to ease some fears of other K-pop fans who might be a bit hesitant to attend a concert due to their physical limitations. 

I am an individual with Cerebral Palsy, which in my case, means that my brain has trouble sending signals to the some parts of my body. The way Ive best heard it explained was, if muscles were lights in a room, the average person only has to turn on one light switch to get all the lights to turn on. For me, it would be the equivalent of having to manually turn on each light one by one, as the process is not automatic. I have issues standing, and especially in a K-pop concert, it is generally encouraged for concert goers to get out of their seats and dance along with the performers.  My biggest fear going into this concert was not being able to see, as people would obstruct my view by standing while I had no choice but to sit. I understand that it is concert behaviour to show the performers that the audience is having a good time by standing up, but I was really not looking forward to attending Redmare for that reason. 

Ive never attended a concert in my life before, but I knew I had to go see Red Velvets concert in my city. Ever since I watched the music video for Red Velvets Peek-a-boo, Ive been hooked and I havent stopped being a fan of them since. Eventually, sometime in January of this year, I joined a Discord server dedicated to people attending the Vancouver show. Later in this post, I will talk about how as admin, managing a meet-up with those people actually enhanced the experience. 

__**Pre-concert Preparations**__

Oh boy. For the Vancouver stop, the ticket vendor handling the tickets was *TicketLeader*. Now, I will say that TicketLeader does have phenomenal response times for customer service. However, it was quite frustrating to actually get a concise answer for questions that I asked them. Due to my disability, I knew that in order for me to attend this concert, I would need to phone ahead of the ticket sales and ask if there was a way for me to choose my seat on the day of. TicketLeader, at least on their website, will randomly generate a seat for a buyer based on the section (P1, P2, P3, or P4) they chose. P1 and P3 were reserved seats (foldable chairs) on the floor, while P2 and P4 were general admission seats in the bleachers. After some (vague) emails, I had figured out that if I called during the day of the ticket sales, that I could pick a seat. I have no idea if all of this is standard ticket vendor policies, as I mentioned before that I had never been to a concert before. The actual ticket buying process was quite simple, and I was able to purchase a seat that was right next to the aisle. 

The venue for the Vancouver stop was the PNE Forum, which to me, seemed like an odd choice. Usually when I think of a concert venue in Vancouver, that is definitely not a place that...comes to mind. Granted, the only thing I know the PNE Forum for is hosting a marketplace there while the PNE (the fair, not the place) is in session. I just wish that KPOPME or SM could have chosen a more well known concert venue in Vancouver? Although, I should just be grateful for the fact that Red Velvet came to Vancouver in the first place. 

__**Concert Day**__ 

__""Discord? Discord!""__ 

As I mentioned back in my first paragraph, I ended up being the admin for a Discord server dedicated towards people attending the Vancouver show. It was actually quite stressful to say the least; I didnt even create the server myself, but I was handed the job because, and Im not even lying, I was one of the only people who knew how to use Discord. Anyways, I just posted updates from KPOPME on Twitter or Facebook, and relayed information in regards to fan projects. It was nice interacting with (mostly) local people who shared similar interests! 

And so, on concert day, a whole bunch of people from the Discord server met up at a Chatime near the PNE. It was pretty surreal, seeing people in real life after knowing most of them only by usernames and profile pictures. Despite many people having an Irene profile picture, I am sad to report that there was no one who looked like Irene in real life. We met up at four in the afternoon, and left for the PNE at around five. One of us brought a ~~ice cream~~ cake but we never finished it. Whoever had the leftover cake at Chatime, youre welcome! 

__The Lineup__ 

When our group arrived at the PNE, the lineup was already pretty long. It stretched a long distance, and this was at least an hour and a half before doors opened at six-thirty. There were people buying fan goods and people handing out banners. I brought over one hundred dollars in my wallet because I knew people would not bring enough for the fan goods ~~but I ironically didn't buy anything~~. The temperature cooperated (unlike the day after, when it snowed) but after a while I had a friend help me sit down of the ground because my feet were starting to hurt ~~but my back still hurt a lot~~. One issue that stood out to me was that the closest restroom was at a gas station since the only restrooms within a close vicinity were inside the venue. Clearly we werent allowed in yet, so it was a good thing I went before lining up. 

Another thing to note was, I was with a bunch of strangers (from Discord) but they were all eager to help me even though it was the first time we met in real life. There were people that helped me walk up inclines, helped make sure my legs didn't hurt while standing in line, and held on to my crutch for me when I needed to let go of it. I'm not saying that people can't be nice, but everyone was so accepting of the a lot of the needs I required while we waited. It was heartwarming. 

__Inside the Venue: Merchandise and Seating__ 

Once the doors opened at six-thirty, the line went quickly and we were able to get in finally. After scanning my ticket, and getting through the baggage check, I went straight to the merchandise line. There were two lines: one for buying merchandise, and the other for picking up merchandise that was purchased online through KPOPME. I picked up a Red Velvet lightstick and a t - shirt. My only regret with my purchases was that I bought a medium shirt, but that was way too big for me. I guess I have a nice pajama shirt now. 

When it came to seating, I got nervous. Knowing fully well that there was a possibility that I would have my view obstructed the entire show, I didnt expect much from my seat. However, after speaking with security, thanks to my friend, I was able to sit in the aisle seat in row 1 with relative ease. I use a (unfoldable) forearm crutch on my right arm, so I was worried that if I put it down on the floor that it would become a tripping hazard. Security assured me that they would put my crutch in a secure place and give it back to me after the show ended. They were very considerate, and I applaud them for their great service. 

I sat to the very left of the first row, with a big screen (for the VCRs) close to me, and a fence in front of me, to separate P1 from the stage. Although the angle for viewing choreography wasnt ideal, the very idea of me already sitting in the first row was already unbelievable.    

__**The Show!**__ 

The show started around 8 pm, opening with Russian Roulette. I might have yelled out heart b-b-beat too many times, but I dont care. At first, it didnt even sink into my head that I was actually seeing Red Velvet in person. On one hand, it should have felt somewhat similar to the feeling of watching their performances online and dancing along at home. On the other hand, those very same people that I was used to seeing only through a screen, were actually performing right in front of me. Sure, staying at home and watching Red Velvet videos is a much cheaper alternative than going to their concert, but theres something cool about being able to actually view those performances live. 

I think this experience really solidified why I love Red Velvet a lot, speaking from purely a choreography perspective. I sat in my seat the entire time, but I still felt like I could participate like everyone else. From the hand gestures in Power Up to the somewhat awkward hand movements in Rookie, because I have better control in the upper half of my body, I was able to at least do the point moves. My favourites are the My head hurts, my pelvis hurts move of Russian Roulette and Peek-a-boos point move. 

One of the highlights of the night though, was Irene walking the edge of the stage and waving at me. Irene is my Red Velvet bias, and I was genuinely surprised she noticed me. I was the only one sitting down for the entirety of the show, so I thought it might come off as disrespectful to someone lacking context and especially the performer. I tried to wave my lightstick as crazily as I could and Red Velvet literally had me sitting at the edge of my seat. Due to the angle I was at, and the height of the people near me, I had to lean forward quite a bit to see Red Velvet. God knows how Irene managed to even notice me, but she did. I have an inkling that I wasnt just seeing things since she leaned down quite a bit when she came to the left edge of the stage. I think that because I was sitting down, my lightstick stood out among the other people who stood around me. I tried to raise my left arm the highest I could, but I guess I still looked short in comparison. 

When Moonlight Melody started playing, I saw a lot of people scramble to find their banners. Outside the venue, there were people handing out various banners, but one in particular was supposed to be held up during Moonlight Melody. The banner read a message that said something like Our artist, Wendy, happy birthday!  Near the end of the concert, the audience did sing Happy Birthday to Wendy, but I think the banner portion was also really special. 

Wendy was loved in Vancouver - really. We all screamed Wendys name so much that night. She looked so cute in her little princess crown near the end. During the last song, Red Flavour, she replaced summer with Vancouver in the songs closing line to make it my favourite is you in Vancouver. 

__**Other / Miscellaneous**__ 

- When I initially emailed the venue, they had stated that they had seats reserved for people with accessibility issues. Whether or not that meant that there was an actual section for people with mobility issues or not, I still dont know, because I didnt notice one?  Its worth calling up the venue to double check if thats a concern!

- The Discord crew wanted to scream the ""PARK SOOYOUNG"" chant and we tried, at least. 

- The robot mascot's name is Reeve ~~totally not Rve~~. I just found it funny how ""ReVeluv"" is pronounced with ""Rve"" but somehow the Robot's name wasn't.  

- Seulgi said she wanted to go bike riding in Stanley Park, but I don't think they had time to. 


&amp;#x200B;

__**Conclusion**__

Now heres the part, where you might be thinking, But Zech, wheres your TL;DR?

**TL;DR: I was dreading to go to my favourite girl group's concert because of my disability but Discord people, and the venue workers made it one great experience.**  


Spending time at Redmare in Vancouver was an amazing experience, and seeing my favourite girl group in real life was surreal. The fact that it was the last stop and Wendys birthday made the date also special for both ReVeluvs and Red Velvet themselves. I hope the girls rest well after this tour, and I hope that theres a chance theyll come back to Canada!

Seeing that they were the ones who inspired this discussion idea, I'll post this now.)

Before kpop, I didn't listen to or really apprecaite rap. I still don't seek it out, but I now appreciate people who can rap and do it well. 

Who do you think are the best rapper duos in kpop? For me:

Joohean and I.M. (Monsta X) - Their voices are so distinct from each other and, because of this, they work/sound perfect together. It's always a pleasure to hear their back-and-forth raps.

Changbin and Han (Straykids) - These young men are going places. I think they are defintley in the next geneartion of amazing rappers.

I don't know many others; enlighten me.

Also, might as well, who do you think are the best stand alone rappers? Some of mine: Suga (BTS), Jinjin (Astro), Vernon (Seventeen), and ZICO. ",106,70,False,self,,,,,

This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",3,10,False,self,,,,,

I'm not really a huge fan of the song as a whole, but I think the break actually works in this case. It's jarring and definitely unexpected, sure, but the song itself is pretty much a meme and somehow having that break does flow well. I know people are pretty divided on it, but I think it works. As for the Baam rap break...not so much. It's a little too slow and jarring, while the Bboom Bboom one felt like the right tempo and didn't disrupt the song too much.

One random rap break I really don't like is the one in Dalla Dalla after the first chorus. Good lord, I don't know why I hate it so much, but it honestly ruins the rest of the song for me and I wish it didn't. Dalla Dalla is all over the place in general, but at least the verses are consistent and the chorus, while unexpectedly peppy, is nice. But that rap break just doesn't work for me. It feels, for lack of a better word, too tryhard and the English lyrics are cringey. Also, maybe I'll get a lot of flack for this, but I don't think Yuna and Chaeryoung are good at rapping so the execution sounds weird and forced. And then the song never returns to this trap sound, so the break was literally just shoved in when it wasn't necessary. I think the rest of the song is decent and the girls have great stage presence, but that rap breakdown is such a nope for me.

So what other unexpected rap breaks have you noticed? Which do you think are the best and the worst, and why? And which songs could do without one?",124,69,False,self,,,,,

I don't want to forget his music. I once watched a vlog serie of a popular K-Pop boyband, and one of these singers admired a korean singer who had passed away long ago.   


The problem is, I can't remember who his idol was.

All I remember about this idol is that he recorded a song, and died the day after (or that was the rumor).  
I believe he died because of complications with his liver/stomach. Maybe because of alcoholism.   
And the song he sung was very sad. This artist died before 2000, which is why I'm so desperate in finding him.

My prime example would probably have to be Hobgoblin by CLC. As someone who just got into them from No and prior to that only knew Pepe and Black Dress, I was surprised to learn that it wasnt really well received, considering that its a really good song and at least I thought they bodied the concept. However, I totally get that people were a bit :/ about the fact that it admittedly does sound like a 4minute track, and was a major concept switch-up for them at the time. Its really unfortunate, because its a great song, it just got affected by those other factors. 

The next would be Solo by Jennie, which is a in itself decent song, but nothing earth-shattering. But the hype (both positive and negative) built up from it being the first Blackpink solo and her lazy controversies was so high that in comparison, unless the song was instantly amazing and iconic, it couldnt have been anything but disappointing. Plus, the comparisons to Gashina/The Teddy Style were inevitable and added to the unoriginal criticisms. Which, again, is unfortunate because its a perfectly enjoyable song, but the expectations and outside factors relating to that song at the time of its release were so high and intense that if it was anything less than absolutely stellar, it wouldntve really been received well.

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**\[Pre-Order Sale\] Best Products of Small Businesses X  Youtuber Collaboration**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/md_techcode_01/)

* Date Project Ends: February 28, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

What is this project about?

So not a typical Makestar, this one in particular is run by the company Techcode, who partnered with famous(?) Korean YouTubers to sell various products such as skin care items, electronics, etc.

I'm assuming these YouTubers either had promoted these products on their channels for promotional purposes or reviewed them.

But yeah, nothing visibly K-Pop related here.

* Date Project Ends: March 4, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is VANNER?

VANNER is a five member boy group signed to VT Entertainment. The group is super new, like they debuted a week ago in Korea after having done promotions in Japan throughout January 2019. Their official debut was with the song ""[Better Do Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S_yxj9UPWg)"", which was released on February 13, 2019.

While not much is known about the group due to their newness, here are a few interesting things I was able to come across:

* Taehwan was previously a Pledis trainee, and supposedly in the pre-debut lineup of Seventeen.
* Hyeseong taught Minhyuk of D-CRUNCH in dancing.

* Date Project Ends: March 10, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Kim Woohyeon?

Kim Woohyeon is most popularly known as a model, grew in prominence after gracing the July 2018 MAXIM [cover](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2018/07/11/model-kim-woohyun-who-recently-appeared-in-maxim-is-an-attractive-human/) that went viral.

She isn't venturing into K-Pop or anything, but this is a way to continue building her brand.

[**Completed H.B.Y Comeback Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hby_02/)

* Date Project Ends: March 24, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is H.B.Y?

H.B.Y is a four member group signed to OPUS Entertainment (formerly Rainbow Entertainment). H.B.Y stands for **H**ot **B**looded **Y**outh.

The group as a whole is currently best known for their appearance on *The Unit*. The group auditioned with a cover of Block B's ""[Nillili Mambo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sWtLwupMx8)"", and members Marco and Taro made it past the audition stage.

Taro was eliminated rather quickly, having ranked #52 in the competition. Marco, meanwhile, made it into the project group UNB, having placed 5th in the final episode.

This is the H.B.Y's fist comeback after UNB disbanded and the first as a four member group, as member Bin left the group relatively recently, as he was mentioned on the group's subunit H.B.Y (Ta-Ji-Hyuk)'s Makestar last year but wasn't included in any of the rewards that have been shipping out recently.

H.B.Y's five member line up debuted in 2017 with the song ""[Vroom Vroom ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NJ_4kwUqTk)"", and their first subunit H.B.Y (Ta-Ji-Hyuk) debuted in 2018 with the song ""[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GIkK6qk3JQ)"".

[**GeeGu Comeback Support Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_geegu_01/)

* Date Project Ends: March 25, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is GeeGu?

GeeGu, formerly Gate9, is a six member girl group from Star Entertainment.

As Gate9, the then nine member group debuted  with the mini album *Gate 1: Paperwhite* in October 2017 under NOS Entertainment. Their debut song ""[Chemical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuWCvrIBr3w)"" was the title track off the album.

From looking into things, it looks like they didn't have a comeback since, making this project their first comeback since debut. Besides the rebrand, three members ended up leaving (Yun, Vivian, Kady) prior to this, so GeeGu is now promoting as a six-member group.

Not too much is known about the members, but kind of a cool fact is Haeyeon actually was in Ye-A with IZ\*ONE's Kwon Eunbi (Kazoo), under the name Pier.

I thought it was the evil edit that made the show interesting but by season 3, I totally became immune to mnet evil edits and paid no attention to them. In fact, I fast-forwarded all the evil edits and excessive crying scenes. I thought it was the performance quality but frankly, produce48 quality wasn't amazing and I have seen way better stages on mix9. Its nothing innovative at this point, the same old company evaluation, theme song, group, position, evaluation and debut performance. 

But what exactly is the reason all 3 seasons of produce were so successful, getting me hooked and emotionally invested? Is it just the human factor where the trainees they recruited are more ""likeable"". Or am i just being brainwashed by the ""produce brand"".",20,39,False,self,,,,,

For me, Im incredibly drawn to vocals as a skill for members - I like to sing myself so its probably the thing that sticks out to me most! 

Id like to know more about the types of biases people pick though! What is it about your biases that make you pick them? Are there any defining traits that make some members more prominent for you? Mine are all girl groups, but feel free to comment boy groups too!

My biases are (you can certainly see the trend):

HeeJin (Loona) - main vocalist, sometimes unfairly gets the majority of lines but shes my ult and I cant complain :)

Lia (Itzy) - majorly bias wrecked me, a Chae lover, upon debut. Her voice is so amazing, the predebut video of her singing gives me chills. I hope their later comebacks give her vocals a chance to shine.

Chaewon (IZ*ONE) - not a main vocalist, but she has a very distinct vocal colour which I love. Her lines in Colors and the PD48 cover of Into The New World did it for me really. She has a really sweet, bright tone thats easy to listen to and spot.

Jisoo (Blackpink) - used to be Ros, but honestly I love Jisoos voice so much. Female idols with lower voices are underrepresented in kpop (though they are fairly rare) and its so nice to listen to a different-sounding voice in a popular group. 

Miyeon ((G)I-DLE) - shes a main vocalist and for good reason. I was a bit disappointed with her lines in this comeback, but her high note in Blow Your Mind made up for it!! Miyeons voice is one of my favourites to listen to, honestly. Its so gorgeous and she nails everything.

Please comment your biases down below! ",43,2,False,self,,,,,

For least like, I'd say Twice Dahyun. She's known for her energy and being one of the variety queens of Twice, but I've heard from multiple accounts she's a lot more chill/laid back of camera. For instance the Vlive of her playing piano (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsAembAtOE0) is a lot more chill than what you expect. 

Sticking with Twice, Mina for the most part is known for usually being more shy and reserved on camera. And according to her members she spends a lot of time laying down watching movies/ knitting clothes / playing games , which falls in line with her on camera character. ",150,173,False,self,,,,,

The visuals on the screen behind them were spectacular, the sound system was good, and I'm very glad I got to go. But I just can't help being salty at having paid \~$160 for a P3 ticket, and was pretty much only able to see them on the screen, or one member at a time between someone's head every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

When Red Velvet came out, everyone in front of me stood up. I understand that people stand to show the performers they are enjoying the show, or because they like to dance to the music. But I was at assigned seating on the floor. Which means if people are blocking you, you can't just move to another spot. Since we were not on the bleachers, everyone was blocking my view. When we sat down for the VCRs, I was a bit mad because I could see the stage so clearly! It would've been easy then to see all 5 of the girls.

&amp;#x200B;

I know for a fact that it wasn't just me who wished we could sit down, because I heard people behind me lamenting the fact that everyone was standing up again. Plus, when I looked at the bleachers, at least half of the people were sitting.

&amp;#x200B;

Being there with other Reveluvs really made the concert experience, but it also seemed like most of them are satisfied just being in the same room as Red Velvet so they can scream at them. I, on the other hand, wanted more. I wanted to actually see them dance together in formation, in front of the amazing stage set up. I wanted more than an occasional glimpse at a member. I know I would've enjoyed the concert a lot more, if we had sat down for even SOME of the songs.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I can't stop people from standing up during the concert. I would understand if we were all in the bleachers, or if there was a GA where we can move wherever we want. But I feel like it's just polite to sit once in a while if people are stuck behind you on the floor in assigned seating. What do you guys think? Do you sit or stand? What has been your experience at a Kpop concert?",53,40,False,self,,,,,

I doubt that Big Bang can return to its former glory considering the barrages of negative press. I reckon Big Bang is just gonna hold on to whatever's left of their fandom.

With the recent rise of popularity of BP which brought in a good number of new fans (to Kpop in general), it'd be wise for YGE to try to permeate the western market as much as possible. It'll be interesting how things gonna pan out for BP since this is possibly the 1st time a Kpop group is justifiably looking to (potentially) permanently shift its main target market. As many might've agreed tho, at this point BP isn't overall exactly ready for that.

The votes includes of 3 weeks of normal voting plus the votes in the group round and the benefit votes gained from it.

The results have been updated on this [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/kpoproduce).

It's voting time again. Just like last past weeks, each redditor has up to SEVEN votes each. You have to choose 11 idols each time.

Head [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxCl644Kw1Hh540qqYMHKz_3ZkoG8kk4ALFjgoxUIP8dOEoQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the weekly voting 

Just like the show, I'm also having the redditors vote for which idol suits which concept song the best. You are to choose one idol for each of the 5 songs and you cannot vote for an idol for more than one songs. You have 7 times to vote for this also. The Top 12 idols for each song will be considered as a group. If an idol makes it to the top 12 of more than one song, the song with more votes will be assigned to the idol. If the votes are tied, it will be randomised. Head [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6Uiw2aTL_qWs7ewla6Rdv94Sd0U14nJnl8iT8AqOIJQ0uRA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to vote!

You have until 7/03/2019, 6 AM EST to vote!  ",15,39,False,self,,,,,
